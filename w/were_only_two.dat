5|$|There <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> minor accidents: a {{car that}} {{collided}} with the locomotive whilst driving through the hospital grounds, and a wagon whose brakes failed whilst stabled at Farm Siding, which rolled down the line to Hellingly station.|$|E
5|$|There <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> other MLs in the vicinity: ML 160 had {{continued}} past {{the dock and}} was engaging targets upriver, ML 269 appeared {{to be out of}} control and was running in circles.|$|E
5|$|After Ealdred's death, {{one of the}} {{restraints}} on William's treatment of the English was removed. Ealdred {{was one of a}} few native Englishmen who William appears to have trusted, and his death led to fewer attempts to integrate Englishmen into the administration, although such efforts did not entirely stop. In 1070, a church council was held at Westminster and a number of bishops were deposed. By 1073 there <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> Englishmen in episcopal sees, and by the time of William's death in 1089, there was only one, Wulfstan II of Worcester.|$|E

5|$|By 14:00 the 4th Parachute Brigade was {{no further}} forward. With {{casualties}} mounting, Brigadier Hackett asked General Urquhart's permission to withdraw {{south of the}} railway line. His intention was to move through Wolfheze and into Oosterbeek where the division's support units waited. The change of direction was further complicated {{by the lack of}} vehicle crossings along the railway line—there <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two,</b> one at Wolfheze and the other at Oosterbeek.|$|E
5|$|In early September 1926, {{thousands}} of Cleveland fans, confident that their Indians {{would win the}} pennant even when they trailed the Yankees by six games, made World Series ticket reservations. By September 23, the Indians <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> games behind New York, but then lost three of their final four games to finish the season three games behind.|$|E
5|$|Monsen and Larssen both left Demokraten in 1916. The next editors were Paul O. Løkke, {{who served}} from 1916 to 1919, and Alfred Aakermann, from 1919 to 1920. Larssen {{returned}} in 1920 as editor-in-chief. Georg Svendsen was the subeditor from 1918 until 1921, when Evald O. Solbakken {{started in the}} newspaper as subeditor. Still, there <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> people to deliver the editorial content.|$|E

5|$|Reactions to the {{extension}} between SR125 and SR67 were mixed. There were reports of faster transportation through the East County area, yet commuters noted a rush hour backup at SR125 headed westbound because there <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> lanes traveling west through the interchange. Traffic along Mission Gorge Road {{was reported to}} have decreased by 20percent.|$|E
5|$|The {{differences}} between tantalum and niobium were unequivocally demonstrated in 1864 by Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand and Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville, {{as well as}} Louis J. Troost, who determined the formulas {{of some of the}} compounds in 1865 and finally by Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac in 1866, who all proved that there <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> elements. Articles on ilmenium continued to appear until 1871.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} scribes were disputed in the past. According to Kenyon's opinion {{there were five}} scribes, two scribes in the Old Testament (I and II) and three in the New (III, IV, and V). Subsequently, Skeat and Milne argued there <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> or {{possibly}} three scribes. Present scholars agreed in that case (Metzger, Aland, Hernández, Jongkind).|$|E

5|$|After Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne in 1660, he began a wide-ranging programme of work on the coastal defences. The Dutch fleet then attacked up the Thames in June 1667, but were deterred from going further for fear of the Tilbury and Gravesend fortifications. In reality, the forts were poorly prepared to resist a Dutch attack; at Tilbury there <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> guns ready for action. The Dutch struck the English fleet at Medway instead, giving enough time {{for the government to}} improve the defences along the Thames and mount 80 guns on the forts. In the wake of the conflict, the King instructed his Chief Engineer, a Dutchman called Sir Bernard de Gomme, to develop Tilbury Fort's defences further.|$|E
5|$|Cedar Fair, the park's owner, {{acquired}} Knott's Berry Farm—the first {{park with}} a Halloween Haunt—in 1997, and implemented the event throughout the chain, starting with Cedar Point. At its debut, there <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> haunt attractions, Eerie Manor and Cedar Point Cemetery. Guests could travel on the Cedar Point Spooky Express through haunted lagoons and graveyards. The first new attraction, Toxic Tunnel of Terror, {{was introduced in}} 1998. Camp Spooky debuted a year later with children's activities in Camp Snoopy. In 2000, Cedar Point Cemetery was re-themed into Pharaoh's Secret. The park added three attractions in 2001, Eerie Manor was re-themed into Undertaker U., and Fright Zone and Magical House on Boo Hill were added.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, there <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> Cambodian women, Gne Kom' Sorth and Lee Heang, {{who had a}} FIFA-approved D-license {{football}} coaching badge. Both {{were recruited}} through FIFA's Spirit of Soccer program and worked to bring the game to areas with land mines. In 2008, the Mine Risk Education Soccer tournament was held and several girls under-14 teams participated. The first women's national championship was held in 2010. Rights to broadcast the 2011 Women's World Cup in the country were bought by the Cambodian Broadcasting Service. By 2012, between Battambang or Phnom Penh, there were 400 girls playing in organised clubs.|$|E

5|$|In the 2013/14 season, Prevc {{recorded}} his first individual World Cup win in Kulm. With a second {{place at the}} same venue, Prevc won the season's ski flying title since there <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> scheduled ski flying events in the season. He went on to win in Sapporo which brought him {{to the top of the}} World Cup overall standings for the first time in his career, where he remained for the next couple of events. At the end of the season, he finished 2nd in the overall rankings, after Kamil Stoch of Poland. Prevc also won the last world cup event of the season in Planica, accumulating three wins and eleven podiums in total which was his most successful season until then.|$|E
5|$|Many former {{adherents of}} the Fasci left Sicily. Life had grown hard and {{employment}} {{difficult to find}} because of their involvement with the movement. For those in Sicily who wanted to change their life for the better in those days, there <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> alternatives: rebel or emigrate. After {{the failure of the}} rebellion many peasants {{had no choice but to}} vote with their feet and opted for emigration. Others remained, and a year later, in 1895, protests against unjust taxes and about the issue of communal land resumed in many towns in Sicily. The disbandment of troop had to be postponed.|$|E
5|$|On January 8, 2009, Bradley {{signed a}} three-year, $30 million {{deal with the}} Chicago Cubs. He was issued a two-game {{suspension}} for supposedly making contact with umpire Larry Vanover while arguing a strike call on April 16, which was reduced to one game on appeal. During an interleague game against the Minnesota Twins on June 12, he caught a routine fly in right field and threw it into the stands, believing {{it was the third}} out of the inning when there <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> outs. The umpire allowed each of the Twins' baserunners to advance two bases as a result.|$|E

5|$|On Twomile Run {{above the}} acid mine drainage, {{a total of}} 19 macroinvertebrate taxa {{including}} 5 members of the orders Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera were observed in 1998. Below the acid mine drainage, there <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> taxa, neither of which belonged to Ephemeroptera or Plecoptera. Above the acid mine drainage on Middle Branch, ten macroinvertebrate taxa were observed, of which five belonged to Ephemeroptera or Plecoptera. Below the acid mine drainage, there were two taxa, neither of which belonged to Ephemeroptera or Plecoptera. In 1999, the macroinvertebrate density ranged from 197 to 1916 individuals per square meter. The concentration of fecal coliform in the water at Cross Fork is 2000 individuals per liter and the concentration of fecal streptococcus is 2400 individuals per liter.|$|E
5|$|Sometime in the Carboniferous Period, some 350 {{million years}} ago, when there <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> major land masses, insects began flying. How and why insect wings developed, however, {{is not well}} understood, {{largely due to the}} {{scarcity}} of appropriate fossils from the period of their development in the Lower Carboniferous. Three main theories on the origins of insect flight are that wings developed from paranotal lobes, extensions of the thoracic terga; that they are modifications of movable abdominal gills as found on aquatic naiads of mayflies; or that they developed from thoracic protrusions used as radiators.|$|E
5|$|The Los Alamos Laboratory and the Army Air Forces {{had already}} {{commenced}} work on improving the design. The North American B-45 Tornado, Convair XB-46, Martin XB-48, and Boeing B-47 Stratojet bombers, {{then on the}} drawing boards, had bomb bays sized to carry the Grand Slam, which was much longer but not {{as wide as the}} Fat Man. The only American bombers that could carry the Fat Man were the B-29 and the Convair B-36. In November 1945, the Army Air Forces asked Los Alamos for 200 Fat Man bombs. At the time there <b>were</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> sets of plutonium cores and high-explosive assemblies. The Army Air Forces wanted improvements to the design {{to make it easier to}} manufacture, assemble, handle, transport, and stockpile. The wartime Project W-47 was continued, and drop tests resumed in January 1946.|$|E
