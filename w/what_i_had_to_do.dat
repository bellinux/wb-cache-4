I did <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Placed {{before the}} same {{circumstances}} today, I would do {{exactly the same}} thing. I will never deny what I did and what happened.

500|$|Malawi's economy while Banda was {{president}} was {{often cited as}} an example of how a poor, landlocked, heavily populated, mineral-poor country could achieve progress in both agriculture and industrial development. While in office, and using his control of the country, Banda constructed a business empire that eventually produced one-third of the country's GDP and employed 10% of the wage-earning workforce. All money earned by Banda was ploughed back into developing Malawi and was symbolised by the building of a top boarding school called Kamuzu Academy (Eton of Africa). In Banda's own words [...] "I do not want my boys and girls to do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> — to leave their homes and their families and go away from Malawi to get an education", was the reason for gifting this school to Malawi.|$|E
500|$|... "Quite a lot, but in {{the sense}} in my {{preparation}} to find the Walter {{that we all know}} now, I {{had to go back to}} him right at the beginning to see where he came from. So that process was started before the pilot really, what was this man like before he deteriorated, so I was able to revisit that. Physically, of course, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was capture the energy, to capture the physicality of the man, the vocal physicality of the man, this was my task. I was aided enormously by my hair and makeup and special effects people here in terms of getting the overall, and indeed wardrobe helped a lot as well. And then we, the shot up through these beautiful lenses that we got a different feel to the episode than we would now. All of those elements work together... to create this version that you see in the episode." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1857 Goncharov went to Marienbad for medical treatment. There he wrote Oblomov, almost in its entirety. [...] "It might seem strange, even {{impossible}} that {{in the course of}} one month the whole of the novel might be written... But it'd been growing in me for several years, so <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> then was just sit and write everything down," [...] he later remembered. Goncharov's second novel Oblomov was published in 1859 in Otechestvennye Zapiski. It had evolved from the earlier [...] "Oblomov's Dream", which was later incorporated into the finished novel as Chapter 9. The novel caused much discussion in the Russian press, introduced another new term, oblomovshchina, to the literary lexicon and is regarded as a Russian classic.|$|E
2500|$|Rivera earned {{straight}} A's {{in school}} until her sophomore year, when at 15 {{she became pregnant}} with the first of her five children, Janney [...] "Chiquis" [...] Marín-Rivera. She supported {{the two of them}} by selling CDs at flea markets, while working toward her GED at a continuation school and graduating as class valedictorian. Speaking in 2003 of her experiences as a teenage mother, Rivera explained, [...] "Usually, when a young girl is pregnant, she drops out of school and concentrates on being a mother. I thought that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> but my counselors told me there was no way they would let me drop out. I had too much promise." [...] She attended California State University, Long Beach, and obtained a college degree in business administration and worked in real estate before going to work for her father's record label.|$|E
2500|$|... "Through some slip-up in the {{apparatus}} in Moscow, {{which was supposed}} to be bureaucratically airtight, this document of Trotsky came into the translating room of the Comintern. It fell into the hopper, where they had a dozen or more translators and stenographers with nothing else to do. They picked up Trotsky's document, translated it and distributed it to the heads of the delegations {{and the members of the}} program commission. So, lo and behold, it was laid in my lap, translated into English! Maurice Spector, a delegate from the Canadian Party, and in somewhat the same frame of mind as myself, was also on the program commission and he got a copy. We let the caucus meetings and the Congress sessions go to the devil while we read and studied this document. Then I knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and so did he. Our doubts had been resolved... We made a compact there and then — Spector and I — that we would come back home and begin a struggle under the banner of Trotskyism." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1990, {{her talent}} {{led to a}} {{contract}} with Teaspoon Productions, headed by Chris Stokes and Earl Harris, who gave {{her work as a}} backing vocalist for their R boy band Immature, and arranged the production of a demo tape. In 1993, amid ongoing negotiations with East West Records, Norwood's parents organized a recording contract with the Atlantic Recording Corporation after auditioning for the company's director of A Darryl Williams. To manage her daughter, Norwood's mother soon resigned from her job, while Norwood herself dropped out of Hollywood High School later, and was tutored privately from tenth grade on. During the early production stages of her debut album, Norwood was selected for a role in the ABC sitcom Thea, portraying the daughter of a single mother played by comedian Thea Vidale. Initially broadcast to high ratings, the series' viewership dwindled and ended up running for only one season, but earned her a Young Artists Award nomination for Outstanding Youth Ensemble alongside her co-stars. Norwood recalled that she appreciated the cancellation of the show as she was unenthusiastic about acting at the time, and the taping caused scheduling conflicts with the recording of her album. She stated, [...] "I felt bad for everybody else but me. It was a good thing, because I could do <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> because I wanted to sing." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{began the}} next day with another dive into the Roman bath, and then started for Highgate. I was not dispirited now. I was not afraid of the shabby coat, and had no yearnings after gallant greys. My whole manner of {{thinking}} of our late misfortune was changed. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> was, to show my aunt that her past goodness to me had not been thrown away on an insensible, ungrateful object. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> was, to turn the painful discipline of my younger days to account, by going to work with a resolute and steady heart. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> was, to take my woodman's axe in my hand, and clear my own way through the forest of difficulty, by cutting down the trees until I came to Dora. And I went on at a mighty rate, as if it could be done by walking.|$|E
6000|$|... "Neither am I," [...] he declared. [...] "Do you {{remember}} {{we used to}} talk about the doctrine of responsibility? I am a pervert. I did <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and I am content." ...|$|E

60|$|One {{kindness}} it did me, that I {{began to}} consider <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> here, and as I could give {{but a very}} slender account of myself {{for what it was}} I run all these risks, so I resolved they should fight it among themselves, for I would come among them no more.|$|E
60|$|The {{difficulty}} was, {{how to get}} Fred {{down without}} scaring the man. I knew that if I shouted he wouldn't wait, but {{would be out of}} the window and away before Fred could get there. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was to go to Fred's room, explain the whole situation quietly to him, and ask him to come down and make himself pleasant.|$|E
60|$|The {{fire had}} burned low. A sense of {{loneliness}} crept over me. I arose and undressed, moving on tiptoe about the room, doing stealthily <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> as if I were environed by sleeping enemies whose slumbers {{it would be}} fatal to break. I covered up in bed, and lay listening to the rain and wind and the faint creaking of distant shutters, till they lulled me to sleep.|$|E

60|$|The singing went on upstairs. Major Fitz-David still waited impenetrably <b>to</b> hear <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say--to know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{resolved}} {{on doing}} next.|$|R
60|$|In the {{excitement}} of the moment, and without knowing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> though deeply impressed with the feeling that something ought to be done when an order was given, I pulled violently at the rope which I had in my hand; the effect of which was to move the gun very slightly when it exploded. The result was that the ball, instead of passing well ahead of the strange vessel, passed close to its bow, and carried away half of the bowsprit.|$|E
6000|$|MISS REED: [...] "For I don't in the least. He is horrid every way: blunt, and rude, and horrid. I {{never cared}} for him. But I care for myself! He has {{put me in}} the {{position}} of having done an unkind thing--an unladylike thing--when I was only doing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Why need he have taken it the way he did? Why couldn't he have said politely that he couldn't accept the money because he hadn't earned it? Even THAT would have been mortifying enough. But he must go and be so violent, and rush off, and--Oh, I never could have treated anybody so!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{asked him}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with this business, that I, a {{peaceful}} traveller {{and an old}} friend of the Zulus, should be made prisoner and dragged off to Ulundi. He replied he did not know who was not in the council of the High Ones, but he thought that Cetewayo the king wished to see me because I was their friend, perhaps that he might send me as a messenger to the white people. I asked him how the king knew that I was in the country, to which he replied that Zikali had told him I was coming, he did not know how, whereon he, Goza, was sent at once to fetch me. I could get no more out of him.|$|E

60|$|Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and I did it mechanically. I {{sought the}} key of the side-door in the kitchen; I sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the lock. I got some water, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to walk far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down. All this I did without one sound. I opened the door, passed out, shut it softly. Dim dawn glimmered in the yard. The great gates were closed and locked; but a wicket {{in one of them}} was only latched. Through that I departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.|$|E
60|$|I {{thought it}} out till my head ached, and finally I got it right. I {{began to see}} that mother's outlook was narrow. No doubt, living with a man like master at the public-house, a man without a trace of shyness in his composition, barking was all right. But {{circumstances}} alter cases. I belonged to a man who was a mass of nerves, who got the jumps if you spoke to him. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was to forget the training I had had from mother, sound as it no doubt was as a general thing, and to adapt myself {{to the needs of the}} particular man who had happened to buy me. I had tried mother's way, and all it had brought me was walloping, so now I would think for myself.|$|E
60|$|When I {{saw him in}} this state, I {{saw that}} for the poor man's sake, {{as well as for}} the public safety, <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> for the time was to compose his mind. Therefore, setting aside all {{question}} of reality or unreality between us, I represented to him that whoever thoroughly discharged his duty must do well, and that at least it was his comfort that he understood his duty, though he did not understand these confounding Appearances. In this effort I succeeded far better than in the attempt to reason him out of his conviction. He became calm; the occupations incidental to his post as the night advanced began to make larger demands on his attention: and I left him at two in the morning. I had offered to stay through the night, but he would not hear of it.|$|E
