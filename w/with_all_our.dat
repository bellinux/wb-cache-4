25|$|Men's sexual {{interest}} in youths {{was reflected in}} prostitution, with young male sex workers fetching higher prices than their female counterparts {{as recently as the}} beginning of the 20th century. In Tianjin there were thirty-five male brothels, housing 800 boys. Although the superintendent of trade at Guangzhou issued an annual warning to the population against permitting westerners access to boy prostitutes ("do not indulge the Western barbarian <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> best favors"), Europeans were increasingly welcomed in the boy brothels.|$|E

25|$|With the Nivelle Offensive in {{its final}} stages, Lloyd George went to the Paris Summit {{authorised}} by the 1 May 1917 War Cabinet to “press the French to continue the offensive”. Lloyd George was keen to build bridges with the generals and told them at Paris (3 May 1917) that he would back their plans (“We must go on hitting and hitting <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> strength”) and stressed that they must choose {{the time and place}} of the next offensive. The next day Robertson stressed attrition with limited territorial objectives, whilst Hankey stressed the importance of Zeebrugge, where the Germans would suffer attrition if they stood and fought. Over dinner the Prime Minister reduced the company to “fits of laughter” with an impersonation of Robertson. Robertson thought Paris “about the best Conference we have had”. With Russian commitment to the war wavering, Smuts, Milner and Curzon agreed with Robertson that Britain must attack in the west lest France or Italy be tempted to make a separate peace.|$|E

This remark on Twitter (...) , was alleged to equate the travelling public to cattle and taunt his party, the Indian National Congress over its austerity drive. Tharoor's explanation that [...] "cattle class" [...] was a well-established phrase for economy class travel, and that it attacked the airlines and not the passengers, was ignored in the outcry. It was also reported that Congress may take action against him. However, this was subsequently resolved when the prime minister pointed out to the media that the statement was [...] "a joke".|$|E
500|$|Harold Wilson {{resigned}} as Leader of the Labour Party and Prime Minister in March 1976. Benn later attributed {{the collapse of}} the Wilson government to cuts enforced on the UK by global capital, in particular the International Monetary Fund. In the resulting leadership contest Benn came in fourth out of the six cabinet ministers who stood – he withdrew as 11.8% of colleagues voted for him in the first ballot. Benn withdrew from the second ballot and supported Michael Foot; James Callaghan eventually won. Despite not receiving his support {{in the second and third}} rounds of the vote, Callaghan kept Benn on as Energy Secretary. In 1976 there was a sterling crisis, and Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey sought a loan from the International Monetary Fund. [...] Underlining a wish to counter international market forces which seemed to penalise a larger welfare state, Benn publicly circulated the divided Cabinet minutes in which a narrow majority of the Labour Cabinet under Ramsay MacDonald supported a cut in unemployment benefits in order to obtain a loan from American bankers. As he highlighted, these minutes resulted in the 1931 split of the Labour Party in which MacDonald and his allies formed a National Government with Conservatives and Liberals. Callaghan allowed Benn to put forward the Alternative Economic Strategy, which consisted of a self-sufficient economy less dependent on low-rate fresh borrowing, but the AES, which according to opponents would have led to a [...] "siege economy", was rejected by the Cabinet. In response, Benn later recalled that: [...] "I retorted that their policy was a siege economy, only they had the bankers inside the castle <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> supporters left outside, whereas my policy would have our supporters in the castle with the bankers outside." [...] Benn blamed the Winter of Discontent on these cuts to socialist policies.|$|E

According to Chayes, they had experimented with other constructs of where these card games would take place, and only about halfway through development came onto the idea of using a pub's hearth as the theme; Chayes stated that with that concept, [...] "this {{is a great way to}} play, it works <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> values, it has a lot of charm".

In a departure from longstanding American policy, the U.S. abstained from the vote and did not exercise its veto power.

The resolution was then [...] "proposed again by Malaysia, New Zealand, Senegal and Venezuela"—and passed 14 to 0.
