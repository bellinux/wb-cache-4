60|$|And down to {{the office}} of The Billow went Kit Bellew {{faithfully}} to instruct. O'Hara listened. O'Hara debated. O'Hara agreed. O'Hara fired the dub who wrote criticisms. Further, O'Hara had a way with him--the very way that was feared by Gillet in distant Paris. When O'Hara wanted anything, no friend could deny him. He was sweetly and compellingly irresistible. Before Kit Bellew could escape from the office, he had become an associate editor, had agreed to write weekly columns of criticism till some decent pen was found, and had pledged himself to write a <b>weekly</b> <b>instalment</b> of ten thousand words on the San Francisco serial--and all this without pay. The Billow wasn't paying yet, O'Hara explained; and just as convincingly had he exposited that there was only one man in San Francisco capable of writing the serial and that man Kit Bellew.|$|E

Comprising twenty-two articles which appeared in <b>weekly</b> <b>instalments</b> from 4 October 1856 to 14 March 1857, Sala's essays are of interest not only for their representation of one of the significant geographical and cultural "others" of the mid-Victorian imagination, but for their distinctive style, which is vibrant and polyglot, eschewing political analysis and statistical information in favour of the flâneur's "gastronomy of the eye" – the vivid metropolitan travel writing so popular with mid-nineteenth-century readers...|$|R

Her geme was romantic fiction and critics generally deem her themes to be narrow; "there is really only one-love (or, in a vulgar sense, romance). The actors are women, and their desire or fate or accident is to marry" (ACT, 12). If this is the case, A Woman&# 039;s Friendship is not one of her customary tales...|$|R
5000|$|Although Dufayel {{is remembered}} for popularizing {{the method of}} selling goods on credit, the idea {{originated}} with Jacques François Crespin, who began by selling photographs on credit, and later built the store in which he also used this selling technique.
