25|$|Curcumin {{has been}} shown to impart neuroprotection against Japanese Encephalitis {{infection}} in an in vitro study. Curcumin possibly acts by decreasing cellular reactive oxygen species level, restoration of cellular membrane integrity, decreasing pro-apoptotic signaling molecules, and modulating cellular levels of stress-related proteins. It has also been shown that the production of infective viral particles from previously infected neuroblastoma cells are reduced, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> the inhibition of ubiquitin-proteasome system.|$|E

60|$|While Mr. Pickwick was {{delivering}} {{himself of}} the sentiment just recorded, Mr. Weller and the fat boy, having by their joint endeavours cut out a slide, were exercising themselves thereupon, in a very masterly and brilliant manner. Sam Weller, in particular, was displaying that beautiful feat of fancy-sliding which is currently denominated 'knocking at the cobbler's door,' and <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> skimming over the ice on one foot, and occasionally giving a postman's knock upon it with the other.

6000|$|This sort {{of thing}} {{is not to be}} defended in Browning any more than in Swinburne. But, on the other hand, it is not to be {{attributed}} in Swinburne to a momentary exaggeration, and in Browning to a vital æsthetic deficiency. In the case of Swinburne, we all feel that {{the question is not whether}} that particular preposterous couplet about lilies and roses redounds to the credit of the Swinburnian style, but whether it would be possible in any other style than the Swinburnian to have written the Hymn to Proserpine. In the same way, the essential issue about Browning as an artist is not whether he, in common with Byron, Wordsworth, Shelley, Tennyson, and Swinburne, sometimes wrote bad poetry, but whether in any other style except Browning's you could have achieved the precise artistic effect <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> such incomparable lyrics as [...] "The Patriot" [...] or [...] "The Laboratory." [...] The answer must be in the negative, and in that answer lies the whole justification of Browning as an artist.|$|E
60|$|In this a great {{subject is}} {{discussed}} {{which would be}} too long for these pages; but I think that there now exists a feeling that literature can herself, for herself, produce a rank as effective as any that a Queen's minister can bestow. Surely {{it would be a}} repainting of the lily, an adding a flavour to the rose, a gilding of refined gold to create to-morrow a Lord Viscount Tennyson, a Baron Carlyle, or a Right Honourable Sir Robert Browning. And as for pay and pension, the less the better of it for any profession, unless so far as it may be payment made for work done. Then the higher the payment the better, in literature as in all other trades. It may be doubted even whether a special rank of its own be good for literature, such as that <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> the happy possessors of the forty chairs of the Academy in France. Even though they had an angel to make the choice,--which they have not,--that angel would do more harm to the excluded than good to the selected.|$|E

60|$|I {{confess that}} when first I made {{acquaintance}} with Charles Strickland I never {{for a moment}} discerned that there was in him {{anything out of the}} ordinary. Yet now few will be found to deny his greatness. I do not speak of that greatness <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> the fortunate politician or the successful soldier; that is a quality which belongs to the place he occupies rather than to the man; and a change of circumstances reduces it to very discreet proportions. The Prime Minister out of office is seen, too often, to have been but a pompous rhetorician, and the General without an army is but the tame hero of a market town. The greatness of Charles Strickland was authentic. It may be that you do not like his art, but at all events you can hardly refuse it the tribute of your interest. He disturbs and arrests. The time has passed when he was an object of ridicule, and it is no longer a mark of eccentricity to defend or of perversity to extol him. His faults are accepted as the necessary complement to his merits. It is still possible to discuss his place in art, and the adulation of his admirers is perhaps no less capricious than the disparagement of his detractors; but one thing can never be doubtful, and that is that he had genius. To my mind the most interesting thing in art is the personality of the artist; and if that is singular, I am willing to excuse a thousand faults. I suppose Velasquez was a better painter than El Greco, but custom stales one's admiration for him: the Cretan, sensual and tragic, proffers the mystery of his soul like a standing sacrifice. The artist, painter, poet, or musician, by his decoration, sublime or beautiful, satisfies the aesthetic sense; but that is akin to the sexual instinct, and shares its barbarity: he lays before you also the greater gift of himself. To pursue his secret has something of the fascination of a detective story. It is a riddle which shares with the universe the merit of having no answer. The most insignificant of Strickland's works suggests a personality which is strange, tormented, and complex; and it is this surely which prevents even those who do not like his pictures from being indifferent to them; it is this which has excited so curious an interest in his life and character.|$|E
