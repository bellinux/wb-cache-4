5|$|The {{question}} of supply—let me {{deal with it}} this way. I generally believe if a government is elected to power in the lower House and has the numbers and can maintain the numbers in the lower House, it is entitled to expect that it will govern for the three-year term unless quite extraordinary events intervene... Having said that... if we do make up our minds at some stage that the Government is so reprehensible that an Opposition must use whatever power is available to it, then I'd {{want to find a}} situation in which Mr. Whitlam <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> morning finding the decision had been made and finding that he had been caught with his pants well and truly down.|$|E

[...] Drinking alcohol emerged as a problem with Winehouse abstaining for a few weeks then lapsing. The physician said that Winehouse was treated with Librium for alcohol withdrawal and anxiety, and underwent psychological and psychiatric evaluations in 2010, but refused psychological therapy.|$|E

500|$|Vanderbilt {{was drawn}} to the notion that Graysmith went from a {{cartoonist}} {{to one of the most}} significant investigators of the case. He pitched the story as: [...] "What if Garry Trudeau <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> morning and tried to solve the Son of Sam"? As he worked on the script, he became friends with Graysmith. The filmmakers were able to get the cooperation of the Vallejo Police Department (one of the key investigators at the time) because they hoped that the film would inspire someone to come forward with a crucial bit of information that might help solve this decades-old cold case.|$|E
500|$|... "When {{she played}} it for me, {{it took me a}} while to find out the visual {{interpretation}} that I could give back to her. And so I <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> night and I got it, and I said, 'I got it: We have to birth a new race.' From the gate, Gaga was like, 'I want Nick Knight for this video. I want a visual.' She was always birthing something visual in her head, and Nick Knight is just, well, he's prolific but he's so genius. It was about pushing the bar of what a music video should be and can be. [...] It's a different time; it's a different era; there are no limits. It is a viral message. I think that there's something in there for everyone, and that's what's so amazing about the video and so specific about the message." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the editing}} phase, Singer {{thought that they}} had {{completed}} the film two weeks early, but <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> morning and realized that they needed that time {{to put together a}} sequence that convinced the audience that Dean Keaton was Söze — and then do the same for Verbal Kint because the film did not have [...] "the punch that Chris had written so beautifully." [...] According to Ottman, he assembled the footage as a montage but it still did not work until he added an overlapping voice-over montage featuring key dialogue from several characters and had it relate to the images. Early on, executives at Gramercy had problems pronouncing the name Keyser Söze and were worried that audiences would have the same problem. The studio decided to promote the character's name. Two weeks before the film debuted in theaters, [...] "Who is Keyser Söze?" [...] posters appeared at bus stops, and TV spots told people how to say the character's name. [...] Despite these efforts, all the actors in the film consistently mispronounce his name as [...] "Soze" [...] instead of [...] "Söze".|$|E

500|$|In March 2013, {{a two-part}} hip hop track {{entitled}} [...] "Bow Down/I Been On" [...] was released onto Beyoncé's Soundcloud account. [...] "Bow Down", produced by Hit-Boy, was written after Beyoncé <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> {{morning with a}} chant stuck in her head, feeling angry and defensive. This was melded with a Timbaland-produced second half, [...] "I Been On", that makes prominent use of a pitch-distorted vocal as a homage to the Houston hip hop scene. Michael Cragg of The Guardian described the song as [...] "brilliantly odd", commending its loud, abrasive production, while Pitchforks Lindsay Zoladz noted the song's assertiveness and believed it served as an introduction {{of what was to}} come. [...] "Bow Down/I Been On" [...] was perceived as a significant departure from Beyoncé's existing catalogue, particularly for its aggressive nature. The song's atmosphere and its controversial [...] "Bow down, bitches" [...] refrain drew a mixed reaction from those who questioned whether the lyric was aimed at women or merely a moment of braggadocio. Beyoncé clarified after the album's release, where elements of [...] "Bow Down" [...] appear on the track [...] "Flawless", that the song and its refrain were intended as a statement of female empowerment.|$|E
500|$|Science fiction Grand Masters, Sir Arthur C. Clarke and Frederik Pohl collaborated for {{the first}} time on The Last Theorem. The novel {{initially}} was Clarke's, and he began working on it in early 2004. But in 2006, at the age of 88, ill health brought on by complications from post-polio syndrome, and writer's block, impeded his progress, and he asked Pohl for help. Pohl explained: [...] "Arthur said to me that he <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> morning and didn't know how to write any of the books he had contracted. The stories had just gone out of his head." [...] Clarke gave Pohl a 40–50 page manuscript plus roughly 50 pages of notes, and over the next two years, Pohl wrote the book. Pohl said that [...] "Everything in the novel is something he either suggested or wrote or I discussed with him." [...] Some of Clarke's notes were so obscure that even Clarke himself could not understand them. Pohl, only two years younger than Clarke, had health problems of his own: he could no longer type and wrote the book out in longhand, leaving it up to his wife to translate his [...] "indecipherable scribbles". Clarke reviewed and approved the final manuscript of The Last Theorem in early March 2008, just days before he died. Pohl died five years later in September 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Before the 1984 season got underway, Boros' notoriety {{from his}} use of a {{computer}} became a distraction {{in the eyes of}} team management and baseball traditionalists. Longtime friend Phil Regan recalled, [...] "He received some criticism for using computers in the mid-1980s and now everyone in the game uses computers." [...] In their book on baseball's fascination with statistics, Alan Schwartz and Peter Gammons wrote:"Baseball's conservatives howled in horror. As 1984 neared, you'd think that George Orwell was in the press box: Almost every article on baseball and computers used a silly, futuristic lead, with machines replacing managers and robots turning double plays[...] [...] [...] Steve Boros <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> morning as the standard bearer of baseball's on-field information revolution. After one year on the job, having been profiled in dozens of publications and all but cast as a circus freak, he became unpopular enough in his own clubhouse that he was fired midway through the 1984 season." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stone's fourth studio {{album was}} written and {{recorded}} {{in about a}} week in Devon in early 2008. [...] "I kind of <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>one</b> morning and wanted to make an album", she says. [...] "It's very, very raw. It's a bunch of musicians, writers and myself, and we're just jamming, basically." [...] In promotion of the album, entitled Colour Me Free!, Stone played concerts throughout the United Kingdom in February and March. Originally scheduled for release in April 2009, Colour Me Free! was finally released on 20 October 2009, after EMI delayed the album's release. Joss revealed that her record company also fought her about the original cover of her new album, calling it [...] "offensive". It was changed to simple text and no picture of the singer on the American edition, the original cover was used on the other editions worldwide. In late August 2010, it was reported that Stone had left EMI and formed her own independent record label, Stone'd Records. EMI announced in late December that they would be releasing a greatest hits album, The Best of Joss Stone 2003–2009. The compilation was released on 30 September 2011. In 2010, She collaborated with Puerto Rican recording artist Ricky Martin for [...] "The Best Thing About Me Is You", and peaked at No. 74 on the U.S Billboard Hot 100 and which topped the Hot Latin Songs and Latin Pop Songs chart, this was Stone's first number-one on all two charts, which also made her the first Briton of non-Hispanic origin to reach No. 1 on the Hot Latin Tracks and Latin Pop Songs chart.|$|E

6000|$|He went {{on smoking}} in the {{profound}} silence. The wisdom of half a century spent in listening to the thunder of the waves had spoken unconsciously through his old lips.

Several men <b>woke</b> <b>up.</b> <b>One</b> said sleepily out of his bunk: [...] "'Struth! what a blamed row!"--"I have a cold on my chest," [...] gasped Wait.--"Cold! you call it," [...] grumbled the man; [...] "should think 'twas something more...."--"Oh! you think so," [...] said the nigger upright and loftily scornful again. He climbed into his berth and began coughing persistently while he put his head out to glare all round the forecastle. There was no further protest. He fell back on the pillow, and could be heard there wheezing regularly like a man oppressed in his sleep.|$|E
60|$|Here I {{must say}} a word about a little follower, present even now before my eyes. I have been {{accompanied}} on my whole journey from Barnegat to Pike's peak by a pleasant floricultural friend, or rather millions of friends--nothing more or less than a hardy little yellow five-petal'd September and October wild-flower, growing I think everywhere in the middle and northern United States. I had seen it on the Hudson and over Long Island, and {{along the banks of the}} Delaware and through New Jersey, (as years ago up the Connecticut, and one fall by Lake Champlain.) This trip it follow'd me regularly, with its slender stem and eyes of gold, from Cape May to the Kaw valley, and so through the canons and to these plains.

I warn you, Sir Everard, that you may find your position an exceedingly difficult one, but, difficult though it may be, there is a plain duty before you. Keep and encourage your wife's affection if you can, but let it be a charge upon you that whilst the hallucination remains that affection must never pass certain bounds.
