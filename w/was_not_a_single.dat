5|$|Swete {{examined}} {{only the}} text of the Old Testament. According to him the original order of the Old Testament cannot be reconstructed; the scribe who converted the manuscript into a palimpsest used the leaves for his new text without regard to their original arrangement. The original manuscript <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> volume.|$|E
5|$|The building's name {{is based}} on its {{similarity}} to the cross-section of a strawberry viewed from above. When Strawberry Panic! was initially created, the three schools were arranged in a triangle, with the Strawberry Dorms in the center, and the dormitory <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> building but three separate dormitories also arranged in a triangle around a central courtyard.|$|E
5|$|Following the attack, the German Ministry of Propaganda checked {{incoming}} {{reports from}} both London and the German Naval High command. Having {{been told by}} Kriegsmarine that there <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> U-boat {{in the vicinity of}} Athenia on the day of her sinking, the Propaganda Ministry promptly denied all allegations that any German U-boat had sunk Athenia. They claimed instead that the British had torpedoed their own vessel in an attempt to bring the United States into the war {{on the side of the}} Allies.|$|E

25|$|Just as the {{minority}} Quranists <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> community, the ahadith-believers or hadithists <b>are</b> also <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> community. Hadithists simply share the feature that, {{in addition to}} Quran, they incorporate belief and practice of ahadith—not necessarily the same hadith collection.|$|R

5|$|For a brief period, the Romans were in {{complete}} disarray. Their best armies in the peninsula were destroyed, the few remnants severely demoralized, {{and the only}} remaining consul (Varro) completely discredited. As the story goes, Rome declared a national day of mourning as there <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> person who was not either related to or acquainted with {{a person who had}} died. The Romans became so desperate that they resorted to human sacrifice, twice burying people alive at the Forum of Rome and abandoning an oversized baby in the Adriatic Sea (perhaps one of the last instances of human sacrifices by the Romans, apart from public executions of defeated enemies dedicated to Mars).|$|E
5|$|The {{author has}} {{attenuated}} Natrum muriaticum (common table-salt) until there <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> saline property left... and yet, with one drop of that attenuation in a goblet of water, and a teaspoonful {{of the water}} administered at intervals of three hours, she has cured a patient sinking in the last stage of typhoid fever. The highest attenuation of homœopathy and the most potent rises above matter into mind. This discovery leads to more light. From it may be learned that either human faith or the divine Mind is the healer {{and that there is}} no efficacy in a drug.|$|E
5|$|The {{domestication}} {{of livestock}} {{was driven by}} the need to have food on hand when hunting was unproductive. The desirable characteristics of a domestic animal are that it should be useful to man, should be able to thrive in his company, should breed freely and be easy to tend. Domestication <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> event, but a process repeated at various periods in different places. Sheep and goats were the animals that accompanied the nomads in the Middle East, while cattle and pigs were associated with more settled communities.|$|E

5|$|In parody masses, {{the source}} {{material}} <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> line, but an entire texture, often {{of a popular}} song. Several works by Josquin fall loosely into this category, including the Missa Fortuna desperata, based on the three-voice song Fortuna desperata (possibly by Antoine Busnois); the Missa Malheur me bat (based on a chanson variously ascribed to Obrecht, Ockeghem, or, most likely, Abertijne Malcourt); and the Missa Mater Patris, based on a three-voice motet by Antoine Brumel. The Missa Mater Patris is probably the first true parody mass to be composed, for it no longer contains any hint of a cantus firmus. Parody technique was {{to become the most}} usual means of mass composition {{for the remainder of the}} 16th century, although the mass gradually fell out of favor as the motet grew in esteem.|$|E
5|$|The Prince-Bishopric of Liège {{was a small}} ecclesiastical {{state that}} had been in {{existence}} since the 10th century. It was ruled by a line of prince-bishops. By the 1780s the state's capital, Liège, was the largest city in Belgium. The prince-bishopric <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> continuous country, but rather consisted of several islands of territory surrounded by the Austrian Netherlands. One of the foremost industrial regions of the time, the prince-bishopric was known for its successful wool, armaments and coal-mining industries, and traded widely. The state was notionally governed by agreement of the Three Estates (the clergy, the nobility, and commoners), but from 1684, officials were elected by 16 separate chambers, each composed of wealthy nobles and guild members elected for life. Many groups were unrepresented, including the bourgeoisie, industrialists and lower clergy. The spread of the Enlightenment, which became popular in Liège in the 18th century, bred further discontent with the political system.|$|E

500|$|Guidebooks for English-speaking {{visitors}} became common, {{including a}} number of official publications, some extremely detailed. Major Dwight D. Eisenhower spent years working on a guide to American battlefields. A 1920 British guide book, The Holy Ground of British Arms captured {{the mood of the}} Ypres League, stating: [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> half-acre in Ypres that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> sacred. There <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> stone which has not sheltered scores of loyal young hearts, whose one impulse and desire was to fight and, if need be, to die for England." ...|$|R

25|$|The Old San Antonio Road <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> road, but {{a network}} of trails with {{different}} routes at different times. The trail's path was dictated by things as diverse as weather and native american threats.|$|E
25|$|I {{watched his}} face, {{and it was}} as grave and serene as that of a man writing in his own library. He was the very {{embodiment}} of tranquillity in occupation. He stood there amid the animal-like babble of the Cubans, the crack of rifles, and the whistling snarl of the bullets, and wig-wagged whatever he had to wig-wag without heeding anything but his business. There <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> trace of nervousness or haste.|$|E
25|$|When Tabriz was taken, there <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> book on Twelverism {{among the}} Qizilbash leaders. The {{book of the}} well known Iraqi scholar al-Hilli (1250–1325) was {{procured}} in the town library to provide religious guidance to the state. The imported Shi'i ulama {{did not participate in}} the formation of Safavid religious policies during the early formation of the state. However, ghulat doctrines were later forsaken and Arab Twelver ulama from Lebanon, Iraq, and Bahrain were imported in increasing numbers to bolster orthodox Twelver practice and belief.|$|E

25|$|The Hopewell {{tradition}} <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> {{culture or}} society, but a widely dispersed set of related populations, who were {{connected by a}} common network of trade routes, known as the Hopewell Exchange System. At its greatest extent, the Hopewell exchange system ran from the Southeastern United States into the southeastern Canadian shores of Lake Ontario. Within this area, societies participated in {{a high degree of}} exchange; most activity was conducted along the waterways that served as their major transportation routes. The Hopewell exchange system traded materials from all over the United States.|$|E
25|$|The major {{innovation}} {{was that}} the Analytical Engine was to be programmed using punched cards: the Engine was intended to use loops of Jacquard's punched cards to control a mechanical calculator, which could use as input the results of preceding computations. The machine was also intended to employ several features subsequently used in modern computers, including sequential control, branching and looping. It {{would have been the}} first mechanical device to be, in principle, Turing-complete. The Engine <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> physical machine, but rather a succession of designs that Babbage tinkered with until his death in 1871.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these setbacks, the INA {{was faced with a}} formidable challenge when the troops were left to defend Rangoon without the assistance of the Japanese in the winter of 1944–1945. Loganathan was relocated from the Andaman Islands to act as field commander. With the INA garrison about 6,000 strong, he manned the Burmese capital {{in the absence of any}} other police force or troops during the period between the departure of the Japanese and the arrival of the British. He was successful in maintaining law and order to the extent that there <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> reported case of dacoity or of looting during the period from 24 April to 4 May 1945.|$|E

25|$|By {{the winter}} of 1944, {{the power of the}} British and American bomber forces had grown enormously. It was now routine for 1,000 bomber raids to be mounted by both American and British forces flying from the UK. American forces flying from Italy could also put several hundred {{aircraft}} above a target. Accuracy had improved, but it was still nowhere near good enough for 'precision bombing' in the modern sense of the term. Precision <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> building, it was at best a district of a city. The RAF and American AAF dropped two million tons of high explosives bombs on 60 German cities, killing {{more than half a million}} citizens (many of them prisoners forced to work in German munitions factories), and leaving 80,000 airmen dead.|$|E
25|$|When Jacob Berab died, Karo was {{regarded}} as his successor, and together with Rabbi Moshe of Trani he headed the Rabbinical Court of Safed. In fact, by this time, the Rabbinical Court of Safed had become the central rabbinical court in all of Old Yishuv (southern Ottoman Syria), and indeed of the diaspora as well. Thus there <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> matter of national or global importance that {{did not come to}} the attention and ruling of the Safed Beth Din. Its rulings were accepted as final and conclusive, and Karo's halachic decisions and clarifications were sought by sages from every corner of the diaspora. Rabbi Joseph Karo was also visited in Safed by the great Egyptian scholars of his day, Rabbi David ibn Abi Zimra and Rabbi Yaakov Castro. He came to be regarded {{as the leader of the}} entire generation.|$|E
25|$|When the Diocese of Newark was {{established}} {{he was named}} its first bishop and consecrated 30 October 1853, in St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York, by Archbishop Gaetano Bedini, the Apostolic Nuncio to Brazil, who was then en route to Rome. The Bishops of Brooklyn and Burlington—whose dioceses were likewise erected in 1853—were consecrated at the same time, the first occurrence of such an elaborate ceremony in the United States. Bishop Bayley's work of organizing the new diocese was not easy. He had more than 40,000 Catholics, mainly of Irish and German extraction, with only twenty-five priests to minister to them. There <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> diocesan institution, no funds, and poverty on all sides. He therefore applied for help to the Association of the Propagation of the Faith of Lyons, France, and to the Leopoldine Association of Vienna and from both received material assistance.|$|E
30|$|To {{cope with}} the urban {{explosion}} phenomenon <b>is</b> <b>not</b> simple, also because it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> phenomenon: it <b>is</b> a question of processes apparently similar to each other but with specific territorial and economic dynamics.|$|R
