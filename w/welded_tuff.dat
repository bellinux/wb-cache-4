5|$|Explosive andesitic {{volcanism}} {{dominated the}} area {{to the west of}} Zion during Oligocene and early Miocene time and probably inundated the region with hundreds of feet of <b>welded</b> <b>tuff</b> that has since eroded away. Three of these tuff layers are preserved on top of Brainhead Peak. About 21million years ago the Pine Valley laccolith formed.

Debris flows carried boulders of this intrusion onto the Upper Kolob Plateau indicating that the Hurricane Cliffs could not have been present at the time.|$|E
25|$|Massive {{volcanic}} eruptions from the Yellowstone Volcano {{northwest of the}} area occurred 2.2 million, 1.3 million, and 630,000 years ago. Each catastrophic caldera-forming eruption was preceded by {{a long period of}} more conventional eruptions along even earlier volcanic episodes. One such event sent large amounts of Rhyolitic lava into the northern extent of Teewinot Lake. The resulting obsidian (volcanic glass) has been potassium-argon dated to 9 million years and was used by Native Americans starting thousands of years ago to make arrowheads, knives, and spear points. The lake was dry by the time a series of enormous pyroclastic flows from the Yellowstone area buried Jackson Hole under <b>welded</b> <b>tuff.</b> Older exposures of this tuff are exposed in the Bivouac Formation at Signal Mountain and Pleistocene-aged tuffs are found capping East and West Gros Venture Buttes (both the mountain and buttes are small fault blocks).|$|E
40|$|This project {{represents}} {{the first phase}} {{in the development of}} a methodology for generating three-dimensional equiprobable maps of hydraulic conductivity for the Nevada Test Site (NTS). In this study, potential groundwater flow paths were investigated for subsurface tuffs at Yucca Flat by studying how these units are connected. The virtual absence of site-specific hydraulic conductivity data dictates that as a first step a surrogate attribute (geophysical logs) be utilized. In this first phase, the connectivity patterns of densely <b>welded</b> ash-flow <b>tuffs</b> were studied because these tuffs are the most likely to form zones of high hydraulic conductivity. Densely <b>welded</b> <b>tuffs</b> were identified based on the response shown on resistivity logs and this information was transformed into binary indicator values. The spatial correlation of the indicator data was estimated through geostatistical methods. Equiprobable three-dimensional maps of the distribution of the densely-welded and nonwelded tuffs (i. e., subsurface heterogeneity) were then produced using a multiple indicator simulation formalism. The simulations demonstrate that resistivity logs are effective as soft data for indicating densely <b>welded</b> <b>tuffs.</b> The simulated <b>welded</b> <b>tuffs</b> reproduce the stratigraphic relationships of the <b>welded</b> <b>tuffs</b> observed in hydrogeologic cross sections, while incorporating the heterogeneity and anisotropy that is expected in this subsurface setting. Three-dimensional connectivity of the densely <b>welded</b> <b>tuffs</b> suggests potential groundwater flow paths with lengths easily over 1 km. The next phase of this investigation should incorporate other geophysical logs (e. g., gamma-gamma logs) and then calibrate the resulting soft data maps with available hard hydraulic conductivity data. The soft data maps can then augment the hard data to produce the final maps of the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity that can be used as input for numerical solution of groundwater flow and transport...|$|R

40|$|The <b>welded</b> <b>tuffs</b> in the vadose zone of Yucca Mountain, Nevada, {{are being}} {{investigated}} {{as the potential}} site of a geologic repository for high-level nuclear wastes. The suitability of this site depends upon minimizing the possibility of aqueous transport of radionuclides from the wastes to the environment. The repository location has been chosen for its isolation by low-permeability rock from both the surface and the water table, in a desert area of low precipitation. The <b>welded</b> <b>tuffs</b> have very low permeability, offering protection from flowing groundwater.

40|$|Silicic tuffs of the {{southern}} Great Basin and basalts of the Columbia River Plateau are under investigation as potential host rocks for high- and intermediate-level radioactive wastes. Nonwelded and partially <b>welded</b> <b>tuffs</b> may contain major amounts (> 50 %) of the zeolite minerals clinoptilolite, mordenite, and analcime. Densely <b>welded</b> <b>tuffs</b> and some basalt flows may contain clinoptilolite as fracture filling that limits the permeability of these rocks. The cation exchange properties of these zeolite minerals allow them to pose a formidable natural barrier to the migration of cationic species of various radionuclides in aqueous solutions. However, these minerals are unstable at elevated temperatures and at low water-vapor pressures and may break down either by reversible dehydration or by irreversible mineralogical reactions. All the breakdown reactions occurring at increased temperature involve a net volume reduction and evolution of fluids. Thus, they may provide a pathway (shrinkage fractures) and a driving force (fluid pressure) for release of radionuclides to the biosphere. These reactions may be avoided by keeping zeolite-bearing horizons saturated with water and below about 85 {sup 0 }C. This may restrict allowable gross thermal loadings in waste repositories in volcanic rocks...|$|R

This work {{presents the results}} of the petrographic and geochemical characterization of the pyroclastic deposits of the Cerro Varela Formation (Anisian), located in the southern portion of the Sierra de Varela, western San Luis province. This unit is linked regionally and chronologically to the Choiyoi Group and also fills the Beazley basin. The base of the Cerro Varela Formation overlies the Precambrian-Lower Paleozoic metamorphic basement and it is covered discordantly by the Upper Cretaceous Lagarcito Formation. In the study area two types of pyroclastic deposits area recognized: crystal-rich <b>welded</b> <b>tuffs</b> and fall deposits, both of rhyolitic composition. The crystal-rich <b>welded</b> <b>tuffs</b> comprise the majority of the outcrops, whereas the fall deposits are morerestricted because of their low degree of preservation. The pyroclastic flow deposits form red-colored layers with eutaxitic texture, columnar jointing and quartz and sanidine phenocrysts in a micrograin, felsitic and granophyric matrix with abundant iron oxides. Felsic volcanic lithic cognates and devitrified vitroclasts are also observed. The fall deposits are solid, orange-colored layers of fine grain size, with underformed vitreous fragments and quartzcrystaloclasts. The chemistry of the pyroclastic units is comparable to the middle to upper section transition of the Permo-Triassic Choiyoi Group in the Cordillera Frontal of Mendoza and San Juan.

40|$|Yucca Mountain is {{composed}} of a thick sequence of silicic tuffs that are quite variable in degree of welding, alteration, and zeolitization. Tuff units above the water table are commonly devitrified or still vitric, {{with the exception of}} the zeolitized Pah Canyon Member in USW-G 2. The devitrified tuffs above the water table commonly contain alkali feldspar, quartz, tridymite, and cristobalite, with minor smectite. The vitric tuffs are partly to wholly altered to sodium-calcium-saturated smectite. Below the water table are generally densely <b>welded</b> nonzeolitized <b>tuffs</b> and less densely <b>welded</b> zeolite-containing <b>tuffs.</b> The specific mineral assemblage present in Yucca Mountain tuffs has important implications in choosing a repository. The secondary phases clinoptilolite, mordenite, and smectite are very important because of their large cation sorption capacities. However, whereas densely <b>welded</b> <b>tuffs</b> containing no zeolite or glass are resistant to heating and do not dehydrate significantly, zeolitized, vitric, and smectite-containing horizons are very sensitive to minor increases in temperature. Smectites are particularly sensitive to changes in water vapor pressure and temperature, and temperature increases can lead to water evolution and large volume reductions. Similarly, clinoptilolite and mordenite begin to dehydrate below 100 {sup 0 }C, resulting in volume decreases. The exact effect of temperature on vitric tuffs is unclear. Under hydrothermal conditions the smectites gradually transform to nonexpanding, low sorption capacity illites, and there is evidence that this reaction has occurred in the deeper portions of USW-G 2. Clinoptilolite transforms under hydrothermal conditions to analcime plus quartz with a concomitant volume decrease and water evolution. Again, there is evidence of this reaction occurring in Yucca Mountain tuffs at 80 to 100 {sup 0 }C...|$|R
