50|$|Some of the {{products}} developed for damp-proofing was Por-Seal, Stone-Tex, Stone-Backing, and Plaster Bond. Water Proofing Paste, an ingredient used {{in the making of}} stucco cement and plaster, was developed for waterproofing. Another <b>waterproofing</b> <b>product</b> was named Water Proofed Cement Stucco.|$|E
5000|$|Truscon {{laboratories}} waterproofing protection {{products were}} for residential housing, apartment buildings, office buildings, hotels, hospitals, and manufacturing plants. They involved enamels and interior finishes. The products were coatings {{to provide a}} dustless waterproof washable surface for cement floors and walls. The Truscon laboratories slogan was Waterproof is Weatherproof. Some of the brand names of these specialized products were Asepticote, Sno-Wite, Industrial Enamel, Hospital Enamel, Dairy Enamel, Floor Finish, Edelweiss and Alkali-Proof Wall Size. Its Asepticote <b>waterproofing</b> <b>product</b> was used in houses, hospitals, and hotels for its eye-soothing finish. Truscon's [...] "Waterproofing Paste" [...] {{was an integral part}} of cement and used in floors, plaster, and stucco to waterproof walls and floors. [...] "Industrial White" [...] was used in the interiors of mills and factories because of its white brightness qualities. Truscon's [...] "Granatex Floor Varnish", a stain-resistant product, was a transparent waterproofing agent that was used on concrete and wood floors.|$|E

25|$|The {{primary use}} (70%) of asphalt is in road construction, {{where it is}} used as the glue or binder mixed with {{aggregate}} particles to create asphalt concrete. Its other main uses are for bituminous <b>waterproofing</b> <b>products,</b> including production of roofing felt and for sealing flat roofs.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the past}} ten years, polymer-based <b>waterproofing</b> <b>{{products}}</b> have been developed. Polymer-based products last for the lifetime {{of the building and}} are not affected by soil pH. Polymer-based waterproofing materials can be sprayed directly onto a wall, are very fast curing, and are semi-flexible, allowing for some movement of the substrate.|$|R
50|$|COELAN was {{a family}} owned company but in 1998, another German based company {{by the name of}} IBG Cologne {{invested}} in COELAN the company in order to assist them with going global.

50|$|Eco-Flex is an {{environmentally}} friendly waterproofing membrane {{that seems to}} work very well on foundations, but not much is known about its effectiveness in earth sheltering. It is {{among a group of}} liquid paint-on <b>waterproofing</b> <b>products.</b> The main challenges with these are they must be carefully applied, making sure that every area is covered to the right thickness, and that every crack or gap is tightly sealed.|$|R
40|$|Tile covered {{bathrooms}} {{require a}} well executed waterproofing {{in order to}} protect the underlying construction from moisture. Länsforsakringar Uppsala pays annually out millions in insurance for damages related to poor waterproofed bathrooms. In recent years, SP (Swedish National Testing and Research Institute) investigated and researched <b>waterproofing</b> <b>products,</b> resulting in greater shortcomings of product defects than expected. This report raises the problems concerning waterproofing and discusses why they occur. By studying product instructions and insurance cases and damage reports provided by Länsforsakringar, the most common problems concerning bathroom waterproofing where concluded. An important part of the report was to find out the actual cause to why waterproofing damages occur. The results of the survey indicate that a common cause of water damage usually is related to poor product installations. The survey also shows that correctly installed waterproofing often leaks at floor drains and floor to wall angles. The conclusions drawn from the report indicates that several things are to be improved with the current <b>waterproofing</b> <b>products.</b> Most of the studied cases showing damage were due to poor installation. To prevent installation errors, better and more extensive rules and installation guidelines are needed in order to reduce stress commonly experienced by workers...|$|R

5000|$|Although {{vulcanization}} is {{a nineteenth-century}} invention, {{the history of}} rubber cured by other means goes back to prehistoric times. The name of the first major civilization in Guatemala and Mexico, the [...] "Olmec", means [...] "rubber people" [...] in the Aztec language. Ancient Mesoamericans, spanning from ancient Olmecs to Aztecs, extracted latex from Castilla elastica, a type of rubber tree in the area. The juice of a local vine, Ipomoea alba, was then mixed with this latex to create processed rubber as early as 1600 BC. In the Western world, rubber remained a curiosity, although {{it was used to}} produce <b>waterproofed</b> <b>products,</b> such as Mackintosh rainwear.|$|R
40|$|Inhalation of <b>waterproofing</b> spray <b>products</b> has {{on several}} oc-casions caused lung damage, {{which in some}} cases was fatal. The present study aims to {{elucidate}} the mechanism of action of a nanofilm spray product, which {{has been shown to}} possess un-usual toxic effects, including an extremely steep concentration-effect curve. The nanofilm product is intended for application on non-absorbing flooring materials and contains perfluorosiloxane as the active film-forming component. The toxicological effects and their underlying mechanisms of this product were studied using a mouse inhalation model, by in vitro techniques and by identi-fication of the binding interaction. Inhalation of the aerosolized product gave rise to increased airway resistance in the mice, as evident from the decreased expiratory flow rate. The toxic effect of the <b>waterproofing</b> spray <b>product</b> included interaction with the pulmonary surfactants. More specifically, the active film-formin...|$|R

50|$|There {{are various}} {{cementitious}} coatings {{that can be}} used as <b>waterproofing.</b> The <b>product</b> is sprayed directly onto the unprotected surface. It dries and acts like a huge ceramic layer between the wall and earth. The challenge with this method is, if the wall or foundation shifts in any way, it cracks and water is able to penetrate through it easily.|$|R
50|$|Although too brittle {{to be used}} by itself, {{carnauba wax}} is often {{combined}} with other waxes (principally beeswax) to treat and <b>waterproof</b> many leather <b>products</b> where it provides a high-gloss finish and increases leather's hardness and durability.|$|R
5000|$|Bickford {{invented a}} machine which would thread and weave {{two layers of}} jute yarn (a shiny {{vegetable}} fibre), spun in opposite directions, over a small [...] "tube" [...] of gunpowder, the whole of which would then be [...] "varnished" [...] with tar to <b>waterproof</b> the <b>product.</b> The outcome was {{the development of a}} fuse which when lit [...] "the fire only travels along it slowly, rate of burning ... being about 30 seconds per foot." [...] Bickford had developed a fuse which would burn for a known length of time, depending on the length of the fuse.|$|R
50|$|Truscon Laboratories was a {{research}} and development chemical laboratory of the Trussed Concrete Steel Company ("Truscon") of Detroit, Michigan. It made <b>waterproofing</b> liquid chemical <b>products</b> that went into or on cement and plaster. The products goals were to provide damp-proofing and waterproofing finishing for concrete and Truscon steel to guard against disintegrating action of water and air.|$|R
5000|$|Kiln Four {{was built}} in 1954, {{increasing}} the plant output to around 300,000 tonnes by the late 1950s. Further growth continued into the 1960s as the mass slum clearances lead to mass redevelopment in towns and cities. By the late 1960s, the plant had grown by an extra two kilns and production stood at over 600,000 tonnes. Development by the Ketton lab saw a rapid-hardening cement (branded [...] "Kettocrete") and a <b>waterproof</b> cement <b>product</b> being made, thanks to the further understanding of what differing proportions and quantities of minerals in the clinker could achieve. Water repellent and masonry cement were also developed by the laboratory, with differing quantities often controlled manually with little control by technology.|$|R
5000|$|Lipstick, lip gloss, lip liner, lip plumper, lip balm, lip stain, lip conditioner, lip primer, lip boosters, and lip butters: Lipsticks are {{intended}} to add color and texture to the lips and often come {{in a wide range}} of colors, as well as finishes such as matte, satin, and lustre. Lip stains have a water or gel base and may contain alcohol to help the product stay on leaving a matte look. They temporarily saturate the lips with a dye. Usually designed to be <b>waterproof,</b> the <b>product</b> may come with an applicator brush, rollerball, or could be applied with a finger. Lip glosses {{are intended}} to add shine to the lips and may add a tint of color, as well as being scented or flavored for a pop of fun. Lip balms are most often used to moisturize, tint, and protect the lips. Some brands contain sunscreen.|$|R
40|$|The {{exhibition}} “Novelty” {{concentrates on}} the aspect of innovation in design. The exhibits displayed are from XX and XXI centuries {{and they have been}} chosen based on the criteria of originality in the primary features of design: function, construction, technology, material, form, tradition and meaning. Thus, it offers an opportunity for looking at the achievements of Estonian design from a wider perspective and ultimately helps to explain the reasons and mechanisms behind the design solutions. Contemporary products, which are drawn from categories of furniture, electronics, computing, medical equipment and motoring, are exhibited alongside historic examples of innovation in technology and design, including Luterma <b>waterproof</b> plywood <b>products</b> and Minox mini-camera designed by Walter Zapp in 1936. The exhibition which was the opening event of the Innovation Festival and the Design Night 2011, was curated by Ene Läkk. Jüri Kermik, Chair from the series ÄKSI, 2002 (catalogue entry, p 64) This series presents a blend of historical and contemporary. The outcome is an eccentric family of chairs that are externally similar, yet distinctive from one another. The initial idea was inspired by the Estonian peasant chair, also known as the Latvian chair. ÄKSI represents its modern development. This chair is easy to manufacture and market as all details of the seat are straight and can be assembled only by means of bolts. All the diverse chairs from the ÄKSI series are made using rather extraordinary techniques, from sawing to entwining. Likewise, the range of materials is wide: metal, plywood, Plexiglas, cord and/or plastic. DIMENSIONS: 800 x 370 x 360 m...|$|R
