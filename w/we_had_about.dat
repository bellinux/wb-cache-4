At another place we had seen before, we dug and found some more corn, two or three baskets full, {{and a bag of}} beans....In all <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>about</b> ten bushels, which will be enough for seed. It is with God's help that we found this corn, for how else could we have done it, without meeting some Indians who might trouble us.|$|E

[...] They also noticed that the game [...] "goes about fixing {{a lot of the}} niggling complaints <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>about</b> Episode One," [...] especially applauding the open forests and rocky hills from Episode Two.|$|E
500|$|By 12 o'clock when I came in {{it looked}} as if we'd lost control of the whole thing. My first {{decision}} was to send a Governor 5 back up to the remand prison {{to see if we could}} hold it, but it was too late. That decision, had it been taken half an hour earlier, would have meant we could have held the remand prison, meaning we could have kept another 400 locked up. Assuming the doors would have held, that sort of thing. But <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>about</b> 200 staff on duty, and we must have lost nine or ten casualties of one sort or another and then you lose staff getting the casualties out. We didn't have a lot of the staff come pouring in until about 1 o'clock. I tell you what really bugged us was there an element of April Fool about it. We rang staff up about it, who said [...] "You must be joking, is this an April Fool?" [...] That's what happened when they rang up my home, my son thought it was an April Fool.|$|E

500|$|The {{tour was}} [...] "conceived and {{launched}} fast compared to most stadium tours" [...] according to Live Nation, who noted that most tours {{of this nature}} {{take more than a}} year of planning, compared to the On the Run Tour that took around one month. [...] "It came together quite quickly, around mid-March", Omar Al-Joulani of Live Nation North America commented. [...] "By April, we had everything together, and once the routing was in place <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>about</b> three weeks until the tour was announced." [...] Following the general sale of tour dates, fans were left concerned as the July 11, 2014 show in East Rutherford, New Jersey remained pending to go on sale for many weeks, despite all other dates already being available to the public. Some reports stated that the reason for this was that the state of New Jersey had implemented a legislation resulting in 95% of tickets for an event having to be available to the public. The show was eventually put on sale to the public on June 4, 2014. The On the Run Tour was the first tour to be a part of [...] "Official Events" [...] – the collaboration of Facebook and Live Nation in which the size and scale of Ticketmaster's database is leveraged as events promoted by Live Nation are imported to Artists' Facebook Pages as [...] "Official Events", providing fans with direct links to Ticketmaster to purchase verified tickets.|$|E
2500|$|The band toured exhaustively {{in support}} of The Young and the Hopeless; [...] "I think we did 365 shows in 365 days, for three years. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>about</b> two weeks off each year," [...] said Joel Madden. In 2003, the group {{performed}} two arena tours. They first {{went out on the}} 2003 Honda Civic Tour, co-headlining with New Found Glory. Their fall 2003 trek was performed alongside supporting acts Eve 6, the Living End, and Something Corporate.|$|E
2500|$|While it {{has never}} been {{published}} or seen, Brodovitch did the design work for what would have been the very first publication of Truman Capote's novella Breakfast at Tiffany's in Harper's Bazaar. [...] The novella was to appear in the July, 1958 issue. It was to be illustrated with a series of photo montages by David Attie, who had been a student of Brodovitch's the previous year and was offered the job on the final night of the class. [...] Alice Morris, the fiction editor of Harper's, recalled that [...] "Brodovitch... had these wonderful photos taken {{that had nothing to do}} with the Breakfast story, but with Holly Golightly's cat. [...] A cat in a window, mysterious-looking, slightly shady and misty." [...] However, after the publication was scheduled, longtime Harper's editor Carmel Snow, who had wielded considerable influence, was ousted by the magazine's publisher, the Hearst Corporation, and replaced with her niece. Hearst executives then began asking for changes to the novella's tart language. By this time, Attie's montages and Brodovitch's design work had been completed, and Morris recounted that while Capote initially refused to make any changes, he relented [...] "partly because I showed him the layouts. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>about</b> six pages with beautiful, atmospheric photographs." [...] Yet despite Capote's changes, Hearst ordered Harper's not to run the novella anyway. [...] Its language and subject matter were still deemed [...] "not suitable," [...] and there was concern that Tiffany's, a major advertiser, would react negatively. An outraged Capote soon took the work to Esquire, and it appeared in the November 1958 issue without Attie's or Brodovitch's contributions.|$|E

2500|$|MTV stated, [...] "The tearing of Janet Jackson's costume was unrehearsed, unplanned, {{completely}} unintentional and was {{inconsistent with}} assurances <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>about</b> {{the content of}} the performance. MTV regrets this incident occurred and we apologize to anyone who was offended by it." [...] The network also said, [...] "Our goal with the Super Bowl Halftime show was to produce an entertaining stage experience with a positive message about empowerment and voting. We are disappointed that this message has been overshadowed by the unfortunate incident". A statement from CBS read, [...] "We attended all rehearsals throughout the week and there was no indication that any such thing would happen. The moment did not conform to CBS broadcast standards and we would like to apologize to anyone who was offended." [...] Viacom President Mel Karmazin said that while the company can be proud of 99% of what people saw on the broadcast, it understands [...] "what a difference one percent can make". NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the show produced by MTV, which like CBS, was owned by Viacom at the time (before the two networks were respectively separated into Viacom and CBS Corporation, both controlled by National Amusements, in December 2005), fell far short of the [...] "tasteful, first-class entertainment" [...] the league expected. FCC Commissioner Michael Powell, appearing before a Senate panel, called the Super Bowl incident [...] "a new low for prime time television". Joe Browne, Executive Vice President of the NFL, said, [...] "We were extremely disappointed by elements of the MTV-produced Halftime show. They were totally inconsistent with assurances our office was given about the show. It's unlikely that MTV will produce another Super Bowl halftime." [...] An hour-long MTV documentary titled [...] "Making the Super Bowl Halftime Show" [...] was scheduled to premiere the following week but was canceled before it ever aired and has never been broadcast subsequently.|$|E
