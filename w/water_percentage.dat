50|$|By weight, {{the average}} human adult male is {{approximately}} 60% {{water and the}} average adult female is approximately 50%. There can be considerable variation in body <b>water</b> <b>percentage</b> based {{on a number of}} factors like age, health, weight, and sex. In a large study of adults of all ages and both sexes, the adult human body averaged ~65% water. However, this varied substantially by age, sex, and adiposity (amount of fat in body composition). The figure for water fraction by weight in this sample was found to be 58 ±8% water for males and 48 ±6% for females. The body water constitutes as much as 73% of the body weight of a newborn infant, whereas some obese people are as little as 45% water by weight. This is due to how fat tissue does not retain water as well as lean tissue. These statistical averages will vary with factors such as type of population, age of people sampled, number of people sampled, and methodology. So there is not, and cannot be, a figure that is exactly the same for all people, for this or any other physiological measure.|$|E

50|$|Professional bread {{recipes are}} stated using the baker's {{percentage}} notation. The amount of flour is denoted to be 100%, {{and the other}} ingredients are expressed {{as a percentage of}} that amount by weight. Measurement by weight is more accurate and consistent than measurement by volume, particularly for dry ingredients. The proportion of water to flour is the most important measurement in a bread recipe, as it affects texture and crumb the most. Hard wheat flours absorb about 62% water, while softer wheat flours absorb about 56%. Common table breads made from these doughs result in a finely textured, light bread. Most artisan bread formulas contain anywhere from 60 to 75% water. In yeast breads, the higher <b>water</b> <b>percentages</b> result in more CO2 bubbles and a coarser bread crumb. One pound (450 g) of flour yields a standard loaf of bread or two French loaves.|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{identify}} critical factors influencing high nonrevenue <b>water</b> <b>percentage</b> which directly affects energy usage in greater Colombo region. It also addresses finding methods to minimize the percentage of non-revenue water. This study was carried out through a data analysis where the energy related data and quantities of water production data were collected from Ambathale water Treatment Plant. The NRW data was collected from relevant officers involved in distribution systems of National Water Supply and Drainage Board. This study only covers the greater Colombo region (Colombo city limits). All other regions have issues related to non-revenue water in different levels. Therefore, generalization of this specific sector results for other provinces may have limitations. Analysis of Colombo city region statistics shows that the water supply entity in Sri Lanka (National Water Supply and Drainage Board) is unable to reduce the Non Revenue <b>Water</b> <b>percentage</b> in Colombo city region which results in higher energy loss in the water supply system. Necessary recommendations and suggestions are made for the implementation of programs to reduce non-revenue <b>water</b> <b>percentage</b> for a significant figure in greater Colombo region since this region has the highest NRW percentage in Sri Lanka. Improvement of service level to consumers, optimization of operational efficiency, reduction of production costs by reducing of specific energy consumption of water and institutional developments are some of the factors that can be achieved. Facilitating access to safe drinking water for people has great impact on socioeconomic development in Sri Lanka. Therefore, results of this study may help to develop a program to reduce non-revenue <b>water</b> <b>percentage</b> in greater Colombo region and thereby reduction of electrical energy usage, while ensuring the safe drinking water for higher percentage of the population living in greater Colombo region...|$|E
40|$|The {{composite}} {{was prepared}} by mixing aqueous solution of different ratios of poly(vinyl alcohol) into dried kenaf fibres. The water absorbency of this polymer composite was investigated.

The highest <b>water</b> absorption <b>percentage</b> was 273 and 251 % for the composite with 2 and 10 wt% of poly(vinyl alcohol), respectively, in 24 hours. The high water absorbency could be due to the interaction of water with the hydroxyl group in the poly(vinyl alcohol) and fibres, similar to other reported works on cellulose composites. Interestingly, the poly(vinyl alcohol) in the composite only starts to dissolve very slowly over more than 7 days before the kenaf fibres started to dropout from the composite. This water absorption capability of the polymer composite could have potential applications that require high water-retaining properties. Besides, this composite is non-toxic...|$|R
