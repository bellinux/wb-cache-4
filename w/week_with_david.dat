500|$|On the {{subsequent}} Born in the U.S.A. Tour, Springsteen generally interspersed hard-rocking song sequences after {{every three or}} four numbers in order to give Weinberg's hands a chance to recover. Weinberg's wife Becky unintentionally triggered one of the tour's most celebrated episodes. She was a fan of the This <b>Week</b> <b>with</b> <b>David</b> Brinkley television program and invited panelist George Will to the Washington-area Capital Centre show. After seeing the band perform, Will became convinced that they were exemplars of hard-working patriotism and traditional American values; he wrote, [...] "... consider Max Weinberg's bandaged fingers. [...] The rigors of drumming have led to five tendonitis operations. He soaks his hands in hot water before a concert, in ice afterward, and sleeps with tight gloves on." [...] Will further decided that Springsteen might endorse Ronald Reagan in the 1984 presidential campaign and talked to the campaign, which later led to Reagan's famous extolling of Springsteen at a stop in Hammonton, New Jersey and Springsteen's subsequent negative response.|$|E

5000|$|In early December 2015 {{the then}} Minister of Finance, Nhlanhla Nene, rebuffed Myeni's request to renegotiate the deal. This {{was one of}} the {{suspected}} causes for controversial replacement of Nene as minister by president Zuma a <b>week</b> later <b>with</b> <b>David</b> van Rooyen.

2500|$|Jaci Stephen {{from the}} Daily Mail praised the casting of Essex in the role, saying, [...] "There {{is always a}} frisson of {{excitement}} when a big star joins a soap. [...] None, however, has excited {{me as much as}} the arrival of David Essex in EastEnders. It is inspired casting, not only because the part of Eddie Moon fits Essex like a glove, but because he brings a gravitas to the show. And those eyes. Goodness, those beautiful eyes." [...] Stephen went on to positively review Eddie's arrival, saying, [...] "It made for a great start to the <b>week,</b> <b>with</b> <b>David</b> Essex's exquisite comic timing bringing some light-hearted relief to the rather heavy Moon/Mitchell stuff of late." [...] Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror also positively reviewed Eddie's arrival in Albert Square, saying, [...] "Dressed in a smart, black three-piece whistle and flute [...] and a white button-down collar shirt, the dapper grey-haired man looks like he could have been a guest at a Big, Fat Gypsy Wedding. But within four minutes of arriving in Albert Square on Monday, he's been knocked over by Carol's car as he snatches Roxy's toddler Amy from its path. Although there have been reports that this newcomer has been banned from singing in the Vic, within 15 minutes he's croaking out a line from the Leyton Orient supporters' song. This is the grand entrance of former 70s teen idol David Essex" [...] Conversely, Jim Shelley, also from the Daily Mirror, criticised Eddie's arrival, saying, [...] "on Monday they blessed us with the arrival of Whispering David Essex as Eddie Moon, the latest example of the Long-Lost Relative Who Has Never Been Mentioned Before that is routine in soaps nowadays. [...] Eddie had been in EastEnders three whole minutes before the writers unleashed the bi-annual cliche of The Mean & Moody New Guy Saving A Child Running Out In Front Of A Car. [...] Eddie spent the week ticking off the components of that great EastEnders cliche, the 'rough diamond'/silver-tongued 'ladies' man.' (See also Dennis Watts, Michael Moon, Johnny Allen, Max & Jack Branning, Steve Owen et al.)" [...] A reporter from the Metro called the character [...] "mischievous", and another from the Evening Chronicle called him [...] "a pleasant, charming character", adding [...] "It seems as if a little bit of Essex will brighten up the East End for a while. [...] s far as I can tell, [...] will be {{a breath of fresh air}} in a soap that sometimes forgets to have a laugh." ...|$|E

As the adults are getting ready for their double date, Susan {{compliments}} Jessie going out <b>with</b> <b>David,</b> almost exposing the ruse until Jeffrey innocently jokes he confuses the girls occasionally. At their date, Jessie is bewildered to be at a [...] "Welcome Home Lisa" [...] party with all of their friends.

Lisa unleashes her feelings and tells Jeffrey that she doesn't like the snobbish Cassie. Susan privately speaks with Jessie, saying her earlier compliment was not an honest mistake, rather she senses Lisa and Jessie were switching identities and warns her of what she did at Jessie's age.|$|R

He sees a busker with a guitar and an open case for donations but walks past him. He also sees a newsstand where the main headline is the story about the firefighter which he saw on the TV earlier. A girl walking by David breaks her high heel and he grabs her hand to stop her from falling to the ground. An old lady sits on a bench with a balloon but lets go of it and it floats away.
