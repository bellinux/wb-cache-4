5|$|Before {{the early}} 1990s, New <b>World</b> <b>Order</b> conspiracism {{was limited to}} two American countercultures, {{primarily}} the militantly anti-government right and secondarily that part of fundamentalist Christianity concerned with the end-time emergence of the Antichrist. Skeptics such as Michael Barkun and Chip Berlet observed that right-wing populist conspiracy theories about a New <b>World</b> <b>Order</b> had not only been embraced by many seekers of stigmatized knowledge but had seeped into popular culture, thereby inaugurating a period during the late 20th and early 21st centuries in the United States where people are actively preparing for apocalyptic millenarian scenarios. Those political scientists are concerned that mass hysteria over New <b>World</b> <b>Order</b> conspiracy theories could eventually have devastating effects on American political life, ranging from escalating lone-wolf terrorism to the rise to power of authoritarian ultranationalist demagogues.|$|E

5|$|Paradoxically, {{since the}} first decade of the 21st century, New <b>World</b> <b>Order</b> conspiracism is {{increasingly}} being embraced and propagandized by New Age occultists, who are people bored by rationalism and drawn to stigmatized knowledge—such as alternative medicine, astrology, quantum mysticism, spiritualism, and theosophy. Thus, New Age conspiracy theorists, such as the makers of documentary films like Esoteric Agenda, claim that globalists who plot on behalf of the New <b>World</b> <b>Order</b> are simply misusing occultism for Machiavellian ends, such as adopting 21 December 2012 as the exact date for the establishment of the New <b>World</b> <b>Order</b> for the purpose of taking advantage of the growing 2012 phenomenon, which has its origins in the fringe Mayanist theories of New Age writers José Argüelles, Terence McKenna, and Daniel Pinchbeck.|$|E

5|$|In 2009 American film {{directors}} Luke Meyer and Andrew Neel released New <b>World</b> <b>Order,</b> {{a critically}} acclaimed documentary film which explores {{the world of}} conspiracy theorists - such as American radio host Alex Jones - who consistently expose and vigorously oppose {{what they perceive as}} an emerging New <b>World</b> <b>Order.</b> The growing dissemination and popularity of conspiracy theories has also created an alliance between right-wing populist agitators (such as Alex Jones) and hip hop music's left-wing populist rappers (such as KRS-One, Professor Griff of Public Enemy and Immortal Technique), thus illustrating how anti-elitist conspiracism can create unlikely political allies in efforts to oppose a political system.|$|E

5|$|The {{common theme}} in {{conspiracy}} theories about a New <b>World</b> <b>Order</b> {{is that a}} secretive power elite with a globalist agenda is conspiring to eventually rule the world through an authoritarian world government—which will replace sovereign nation-states—and an all-encompassing propaganda whose ideology hails {{the establishment of the}} New <b>World</b> <b>Order</b> as the culmination of history's progress. Many influential historical and contemporary figures have therefore been purported {{to be part of a}} cabal that operates through many front organizations to orchestrate significant political and financial events, ranging from causing systemic crises to pushing through controversial policies, at both national and international levels, as steps in an ongoing plot to achieve world domination.|$|E

5|$|A light novel titled Shikamaru Hiden: A Cloud Drifting in Silent Darkness, {{written by}} Takashi Yano and {{illustrated}} by Kishimoto, stars Shikamaru as the main character and narrator. The novel is set {{two years after the}} Fourth Ninja War, focusing on Shikamaru's assignment as organizer of the newly formed Shinobi Union to capture a rogue ninja who rules over the distant Land of Silence and attempts to establish a new <b>world</b> <b>order</b> ruled by the common people. It also explores his growing relationship with Temari, culminating in him struggling to name his child with her, {{years after the end of}} the novel.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler, {{after an}} {{unsuccessful}} attempt {{to overthrow the}} German government in 1923, eventually became the Chancellor of Germany in 1933. He abolished democracy, espousing a radical, racially motivated revision of the <b>world</b> <b>order,</b> and soon began a massive rearmament campaign. Meanwhile, France, to secure its alliance, allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia, which Italy desired as a colonial possession. The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the Territory of the Saar Basin was legally reunited with Germany and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, accelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced conscription.|$|E

5|$|Conspiracy theorists {{generally}} {{speculate that}} the New <b>World</b> <b>Order</b> is being implemented gradually, citing {{the formation of the}} U.S. Federal Reserve System in 1913; the League of Nations in 1919; the International Monetary Fund in 1944; the United Nations in 1945; the World Bank in 1945; the World Health Organization in 1948; the European Union and the euro currency in 1993; the World Trade Organization in 1998; the African Union in 2002; and the Union of South American Nations in 2008 as major milestones.|$|E
5|$|Conspiracy {{theorists have}} long {{associated}} Freemasonry with the New <b>World</b> <b>Order</b> and the Illuminati, and state that Freemasonry as an organisation is either bent on world domination or already secretly {{in control of}} world politics.
