But the basis on which this lake—the only natural one in the {{southern}} Appalachians—exists has {{been the source of}} much speculation.

40|$|Abstract: Plastinated {{specimens}} are {{a relatively}} new and unique type of teaching aids obtained from natural specimens preserved by replacing all the body fluids and fats with plastic polymers. In a previous study a procedure was adapted from the standard S 10 procedure by using locally available silicone paste and hardener as substitutes to the standard onesto plastinatea bovine heart and kidneys. The hardener {{was applied to the}} specimens at the post impregnation stage. The plastinates maintained their general shapes but with various degrees of discolourations and shrinkages. In this study the adapted procedure was modified to minimise degree of discolourations and shrinkages by eliminating the <b>washing-out</b> stage, and by applying hardener to specimens at pre-impregnation instead of post-impregnation. Shrinkage was 5. 62 % – 8. 48 % and 5. 23 % – 9. 41 % in the hearts and kidneys respectively with optimum shrinkages at dehydration. Shrinkages were not significantly different (p> 0. 05) among plastinated hearts but varied significantly (p≤ 0. 05) among plastination stages. For the kidneys, shrinkage varied significantly (p≤ 0. 05) among samples and among stages of plastination. Levels of shrinkages of the hearts did not differ significantly (p> 0. 05) from the kidneys. Mean shrinkage in this study did not differ significantly (p> 0. 05) from that of the 2012 study. Just as in the 2012 study the plastinated hearts and kidneys maintained their general shapes, were hard, dry and light brown in colour.

40|$|The {{centrifugal}} elutriator {{has been}} used as a baby machine by loading the chamber with a population of mixed-generation daughter cells and allowing this population to grow, divide and age under continuous <b>washing-out</b> of newborn daughter cells. Clear peaks in the number of elutriated cells were reproducibly obtained for at least ten generations. The parent cells growing in the chamber continued to divide at the steady-state generation time of 95 - 100 min, showing no change in cycle time during aging. The washed-out daughter cells increased in volume during the first five generations from their steady-state value of 17 micro 3 to a maximum of 34 micro 3. As to be expected, the generation times of these large daughters, determined in a synchronous batch culture, were shorter (130 min) than that of the steady-state daughters (240 min), even when derived from 15 -generation parents. No indication for a volume increase of daughter cells without bud was observed when a population was allowed to grow in the chamber without <b>washing-out</b> the smaller daughter cells. The 15 -generation parent population, recovered from the chamber, had an average volume of 80 micro 3 and consisted of: (i) 71 % cells with more than ten scars, (ii) 13 % cells with one to nine scars, and (iii) 17 % daughter cells.

40|$|International audienceConventional {{genotoxicity}} tests are technically difficult {{to apply to}} oocytes, and results obtained on somatic cells cannot be extrapolated to gametes. We have previously described a comet assay (original-CA) on denuded mouse oocytes, but, invivo, oocytes are not isolated from their surrounding follicular cells. Our objective {{was to develop a}} comet assay on cumulus-oocyte complexes (COC-CA) for a more physiological approach to study the genotoxicity of environmental factors on oocytes. For COC-CA, whole COC were exposed directly to exogenous agents after ovulation and removal from oviducts. Three conditions were studied: a negative control group, and two positive control groups, one of which was exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and the other group was incubated with cerium dioxide nanoparticles (CeO 2 NPs). With both tests, DNA damage was significant in the presence of both H 2 O 2 and CeO 2 NPs compared with the negative control. COC-CA offers an interesting tool for assaying the genotoxicity of environmental agents towards germinal cells. Furthermore, COC-CA is less time-consuming and simplifies the protocol of the original-CA, because COC-CA is easier to perform without the <b>washing-out</b> procedure...|$|E
40|$|Owing to {{the great}} local and {{temporal}} sC'ltter of ice salinity, the shape of its steady-state profile in ice of equilibrium thickness is only approximately known. Hence the purpose of theoriz-ing {{on the way in}} which it establishes itself is to suggest pertinent experiments rather than to explain physical causes. Four mechanisms of salt migration are discussed: 1) "Brine pocket diffusion", as explained by Whitman. It is too slow to be of significance here. 2) "Gravity drainage", as observed in the laboratory by Kingery and Goodnow. It is unlikely to occur in natural, thick floating ice. However, their basic concept may be applicable in a modified form as 3) "Flushing " or <b>washing-out.</b> A quantitative calculation which assumes the replacement of brine by meltwater from the surface to be a function of ice salinity and maximum temperature leads to a steady-state salinity profile similar to that suggested by observations. 4) "Brine expulsion " as a result of temperature changes and the separation of liquid and gaseous inclusions during the cooling cycle (Nakaya, Bennington) is also treated numerically and results, as does 3), in a steady-state salinity profile resemblant of observations.

The results were used of long-term stationary experiments conducted at the ÚKZUZ (Institute for Supervising and Testing in Agriculture) by means of lysimeter measurements and monitoring of meteorological data taking into account the respective production region. The trial plots are located {{in various parts of the}} Czech Republic therefore we can compare the results of experiments according to the soil-leaching regimes, various degree of fertilisation on arable land etc. Three crop rotations were evaluated (1989 - 1996, 1997 - 2004, 2005 - 2012). The most severe losses caused by washing out were losses of calcium, sulphates and nitrate N. In the case of N and K the balance of nutrients (uptake [...] outflow) was in most cases negative with the exception of potato growing. This negative balance is based on the higher outflow (withdrawal by yields + <b>washing-out</b> losses) as compared to the lower input (nutrient uptake from fertilisers + precipitation). The balance was more negative in the BVO (potato growing region) with a soil-leaching phase than in the ŘVO (sugar-beet growing region) where the soil-leaching regime was periodic.

Major reasons include: easiness to construct and repair, flexible with respect to settlement, favourable wave energy dissipation, fitness for any water depth and foundation, and because of their economical nature if rubble-stones are readily available. A complete failure of the rubble mound structure can be expected if the stone gradation is improper or if filters are not provided, or are improperly constructed to specification. Many failures have been attributed to internal erosion whereby beach materials are removed by percolating water, such as that due to water waves and surface run-off. <b>Washing-out</b> of the backfills, settlement of the main structure and overtopping of the subsequent waves will follow eventually. Two-dimensional model experiments have been conducted in order to clarify the basic characteristics of sand scour under dolos-protected rubble mound breakwaters, and to investigate some preventive measures against the scouring process. The inter-relationships of parameters associated with the scouring process have been investigated. Sand scour in a three-dimensional model has been discussed, and design procedures associated with Rubble Mound Breakwater and Dolos concrete armour units have also been included.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the resonant leptogenesis scenario in the minimally U(1) _B-L extended standard model with minimal flavor violation. In our model, the U(1) _B-L gauge symmetry is broken at the TeV scale and standard model singlet neutrinos gain Majorana masses of order TeV. In addition, we introduce a flavor symmetry on the singlet neutrinos at a scale higher than TeV. The flavor symmetry is explicitly {{broken by the}} neutrino Dirac Yukawa coupling, which induces splittings in the singlet neutrino Majorana masses at lower scales through renormalization group evolutions. We call this setup "minimal flavor violation". The mass-splittings are proportional to the tiny Dirac Yukawa coupling, and hence they automatically enhance the CP asymmetry parameter necessary for the resonant leptogenesis mechanism. In this paper, we calculate the baryon number yield by solving the Boltzmann equations, including the effects of U(1) _B-L gauge boson that also has TeV scale mass and causes <b>washing-out</b> of the singlet neutrinos {{in the course of}} thermal leptogenesis. The Dirac Yukawa coupling for neutrinos is fixed in terms of neutrino oscillation data and an arbitrary 3 × 3 complex-valued orthogonal matrix.

40|$|As a {{continuation}} of the preliminary study of the colorimetric method as a rapid means of control of polysulphide solutions, the effect of free alkali on sodium polysulphide solutions at room temperature was studied, since in the process of dipping the <b>washing-out</b> of the suint of the fleece results in the interaction of clipwash with alkali and in the formation of alkali polysulphides. It was found that the chemical interaction, as revealed by ordinary chemical analysis, is slight, though the colorimetric study reveals a marked change in chemical nature. This change was ascribed, either to the formation of a complex compound between the alkali and the polysulphide, or to the existence of different isomers of the polysulphides in solution. The observation that field samples of lime-sulphur cannot be directly compared calorimetrically is thus partially explained. It was further shown that the addition of excess sodium carbonate and alcohol causes immediate precipitation of all turbidity-forming materials, rendering a perfectly clear solution of the alkali polysulphides which can be matched against a potassium dichromate standard. In this way fairly accurate values were obtained with both used and unused lime-sulphur clip washes. It is proposed to apply this colorimetric principle for evolving a simple field method of control.

Intracellular infusion of InsP 5 (up to 50 μm) or 10 μm InsP 6 had no action on Ba 2 + current, whereas 50 μm InsP 6 or 10 μm InsP 5 plus 10 μm InsP 6 (InsP 5, 6) stimulated the inward current.

Ninety percent of the ADM was apparently 'loosely' bound. After 4 h and 24 h constant-rate infusions and also after 2 h and 24 h incubations in vitro, the cells accumulated ADM gradually, and the subsequent <b>washing-out</b> of the cellular ADM was substantially less, most of the ADM being 'tightly' bound. Despite these different patterns of uptake and retention after in vivo short- and long-lasting infusion of the same total dose, the 'tightly-bound' cellular ADM concentrations were the same. Moreover, comparable cellular ADM concentrations, retained after efflux of the 'loosely-bound' cellular ADM fraction were equally cytotoxic to normal human clonogenic cells. Short-lasting cellular peak ADM concentrations which occur after a bolus injection or after short exposure to high ADM concentrations are not essential for the cytotoxic effect, {{in contrast to the}} retained, 'tightly-bound' cellular ADM levels...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstract “Stone runs” is the Falklands vernacular {{term for}} {{openwork}} boulder accumulations, which include extensive blockstreams like the famous Darwin “stone-river” and associated {{features such as}} stone stripes. Since the early 20 th century, they have been interpreted {{as the product of}} a suite of periglacial processes, including frost-wedging, gelifluction, frost heave, frost-sorting and snowmelt runoff. Following a literature review, the results of recent field investigations of the valley-floor blockstreams of East Falkland are presented. Access to the internal structure of these forms provides evidence for the existence of a three-fold profile, with clear vertical size gradation presenting striking similarities with an inverted weathering profile. Micromorphological analyses, SEM, XRD, thin sections and grain-size analyses lead to the hypothesis of an alternative model of stone run formation. It is suggested that the material forming the stone run profile lato sensu (including the superficial pavement) is not of periglacial origin, but derives directly from the stripping and accumulation downslope of a regolith, possibly Tertiary in age and formed under subtropical or temperate conditions. The valley-floor stone runs should, therefore, be considered as complex polygenetic landforms that may have formed according to a six-stage scenario, including in situ chemical weathering, regolith stripping by mass movements, soil formation, further regolith stripping, downslope accumulation and matrix <b>washing-out</b> (all phases possibly achieved by the Early Quaternary). Periglacial reworking of the stone run material would have operated at a “final” stage, i. e. during Quaternary cold stages, with boulder bioweathering and limonite-staining operating during the temperate intervals including the present one. The suggested antiquity of the Falklands blockstreams is in accordance with Caine's pioneer interpretation of Tasmania blockfields and with recent analyses and cosmogenic datings of blockfields from Scandinavia and North America...|$|E
40|$|Alcoholism is {{responsible}} for more than 6 % of deaths internationally per annum. The development of acute tolerance to ethanol (EtOH) is {{a critical component of}} alcoholism. Previous studies identified large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels as potential EtOH targets in a variety of species and cells. In order to elucidate mechanisms underlying tolerance development, I used inside-out patch clamp techniques to measure EtOH induced changes in channel activity (measured as open probability) of hSlo, hSlo+β 1, and hSlo+β 4 channels exogenously expressed in HEK 293 cells. I show that the human BK channels have subunit dependent responses to acute application of EtOH, and the magnitude of potentiation was dependent on the concentration of ethanol used and the type of β-subunit expressed. In addition the subunit dependent effects on the channels were a function of cytosolic calcium concentration. Furthermore, to determine if BK channels in ripped-off patches can become tolerant to EtOH, I monitored changes in channel activity in response to a second application of the drug, 10 -minutes after <b>washing-out</b> the first exposure. I found that channels were less responsive to the second exposure, indicative of tolerance. I examined long-term consequences of EtOH exposure by repeating these experiments on cells cultured in 25 mM EtOH in the culture medium for 24 -hours. Under these conditions, all three channel types show chronic tolerance has developed as revealed by the response to acute EtOH applications. Subunit-dependent differences to the development of acute tolerance were apparent, however. In response to a second application to EtOH, hSlo+β 4 channels were now inhibited. Overall, these results indicate that BK channels respond to and develop tolerance to EtOH in the absence of cellular context, suggesting the possibility that alcohol tolerance within organisms may be in part mediated by changes imparted by EtOH on BK channels directly...|$|E
40|$|In cycling, a {{circular}} pedaling action {{makes the most}} useful contribution to forward propulsion. Training with independent cranks (IC) has been proposed to improve the pedaling action. The aims of this study were, first, to assess whether the intermuscular coordination pattern of the pedaling action with normal cranks (NC) is modified after a training period with IC and, second, {{to determine if the}} new coordination pattern is maintained after a <b>washing-out</b> period. Eighteen cyclists, divided into a control (CG) and an experimental (EG) group, underwent 2 test sessions (T 1 and T 2) separated by 2 weeks of training (18 hours). The electromyographic (EMG) activity of 4 lower limbs' muscles was recorded while the athletes pedaled at 80 rpm for 60 seconds at 30 and 50 % of the maximal power output determined during a maximal pedaling test. The tasks were performed with IC (EG) and NC (EG and CG). The EG underwent a retention test session (T 3) after another 18 -hour training with NC. EG showed a significant (45. 8 ± 8. 8 vs. 36. 0 ± 6. 1 %, p < 0. 01 at 30 % intensity) and a quasi-significant (62. 7 ± 10. 3 vs. 54. 2 ± 8. 7 %, p = 0. 09 at 50 % intensity) decrease in vastus lateralis EMG activity and a quasi-significant (36. 4 ± 13. 4 vs. 43. 5 ± 10. 9 %, p = 0. 09 at 30 % intensity) and a significant (54. 5 ± 12. 1 vs. 65. 5 ± 16. 1 %, p < 0. 05 at 50 % intensity) increase in biceps femoris EMG activity between T 1 -NC and T 2 -NC. By T 3, EMG activity returned to initial levels (T 1). On the contrary, CG did not reveal any significant variation. The results provide scientific support for muscle coordination pattern alteration from the use of IC, potentially achieving a more effective pedaling action. IC training reduces quadriceps exertion, thus preserving it for important moments during competition...|$|E
40|$|Direct {{numerical}} simulations (DNS) of turbulent {{thermal convection}} in a box-shaped domain with regular surface roughness at the heated bottom and cooled top surfaces are conducted for Prandtl number Pr= 0. 786 and Rayleigh numbers Ra between 106 and 108. The surface roughness is introduced by four parallelepiped equidistantly distributed obstacles {{attached to the}} bottom plate, and four obstacles located symmetrically at the top plate. By varying Ra and {{the height and width}} of the obstacles, we investigate the influence of the regular wall roughness on the turbulent heat transport, measured by the Nusselt number Nu. For fixed Ra, the change in the value of Nu is determined not only by the covering area of the surface, i. e. the obstacle height, but also by the distance between the obstacles. The heat flux enhancement is found to be largest for wide cavities between the obstacles which can be ‘washed out’ by the flow. This is also manifested in an empirical relation, which is based on the DNS data. We further discuss theoretical limiting cases for very wide and very narrow obstacles and combine them into a simple model for the heat flux enhancement due to the wall roughness, without introducing any free parameters. This model predicts well the general trends and the order of magnitude of the heat flux enhancement obtained in the DNS. In the Nu versus Ra scaling, the obstacles work in two ways: for smaller Ra an increase of the scaling exponent compared to the smooth case is found, which is connected to the heat flux entering the cavities from below. For larger Ra the scaling exponent saturates to the one for smooth plates, which can be understood as a full <b>washing-out</b> of the cavities. The latter is also investigated by considering the strength of the mean secondary flow in the cavities and its relation to the wind (i. e. the large-scale circulation), that develops in the core part of the domain. Generally, an increase in the roughness height leads to stronger flows both in the cavities and in the bulk region, while an increase in the width of the obstacles strengthens only the large-scale circulation of the fluid and weakens the secondary flows. An increase of the Rayleigh number always leads to stronger flows, both in the cavities and in the bulk...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of an}} {{on-going}} {{study on}} the suitability of a formal therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of antiviral drugs for improving the management of HIV infection, a high-performance liquid chromatography method has been developed to quantify simultaneously in plasma five HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) (i. e., indinavir, amprenavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, nelfinavir) and the novel non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor efavirenz. After viral inactivation by heat (60 degrees C for 60 min), plasma (600 microl), with clozapine added as internal standard, is diluted 1 : 1 with phosphate buffer, pH 7 and subjected to a solid-phase extraction on a C 18 cartridge. Matrix components are eliminated with 2 x 500 microl of a solution of 0. 1 % H 3 PO 4 neutralised with NaOH to pH 7. PIs and efavirenz are eluted with 3 x 500 microl MeOH. The resulting eluate is evaporated under nitrogen at room temperature and is reconstituted in 100 microl 50 % MeOH. A 40 -microl volume is subjected to HPLC analysis onto a Nucleosil 100, 5 microm C 18 AB column, using a gradient elution of MeCN and phosphate buffer adjusted to pH 5. 15 and containing 0. 02 % sodium heptanesulfonate: 15 : 85 at 0 min [...] > 30 : 70 at 2 min [...] > 32 : 68 at 8 min [...] > 42 : 58 at 18 min [...] > 46 : 54 at 34 min, followed by column cleaning with MeCN-buffer, pH 5. 15 (90 : 10), onto which 0. 3 % AcOH is added. Clozapine, indinavir, amprenavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, efavirenz and nelfinavir are detected by UV at 201 nm at a retention time of 8. 2, 13. 0, 16. 3, 21. 5, 26. 5, 28. 7 and 31. 9 min, respectively. The total run time for a single analysis is 47 min, including the <b>washing-out</b> and reequilibration steps. The calibration curves are linear over the range 100 - 10, 000 ng/ml. The absolute recovery of PIs/efavirenz is always higher than 88 %. The method is precise with mean inter-day relative standard deviations within 2. 5 - 9. 8 % and accurate (range of inter-day deviations - 4. 6 to + 4. 3 %). The in vitro stability of plasma spiked with PIs/efavirenz at 750, 3000 and 9000 ng/ml has been studied at room temperature, - 20 degrees C and + 60 degrees C. The method has been validated and is currently applied to the monitoring of PIs and efavirenz in HIV patients. This HPLC assay may help clinicians confronted to questionable compliance, side effects or treatment failure in elucidating whether patients are exposed to adequate circulating drug levels. The availability of such an assay represents an essential step in elucidating the utility of a formal TDM for the optimal follow-up of HIV patients...|$|E
