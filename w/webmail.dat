40|$|Computers and {{services}} such as eBanks and <b>WebMails</b> that identify users only at login via credentials are vulnerable to Identity Theft. Hackers perpetrate fraudulent activity under stolen identities by using credentials, such as passwords and smartcards, unlawfully obtained from legitimate users or by using logged-on computers that are left unattended. User verification methods provide an additional security layer by continuously confirming the identity of logged-on users based on their physiological and behavioral characteristics. We introduce a novel method that continuously verifies users according to characteristics of their interaction with the pointing device of the computer e. g. mouse, touch pad and stylus. The contribution of this work is three-fold: first, user verification is derived by combining the classification results of each individual mouse action, {{in contrast to the}} histogram approach in [2] in which verification is based on aggregations of mouse actions. Second, we propose a hierarchy of mouse actions from which the features are extracted. Third, we introduce new features to characterize the mouse activity which are used in conjunction with features proposed in previous work. The proposed algorithm outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by achieving higher verification accuracy while reducing the response time of the system. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{increase}} of online services, such as eBanks, <b>WebMails,</b> in which users are verified by a username and password, is increasingly exploited by Identity Theft procedures. Identity Theft is a fraud, in which someone {{pretends to be}} someone else is order to steal money or get other benefits. To overcome the problem of Identity Theft an additional security layer is required. Within the last decades the option of verifying users based on their keystroke dynamics was proposed during login verification. Thus, the imposter {{has to be able to}} type in a similar way to the real user in addition to having the username and password. However, verifying users upon login is not enough, since a logged station/mobile is vulnerable for imposters when the user leaves her machine. Thus, verifying users continuously based on their activities is required. Within the last decade there is a growing interest and use of biometrics tools, however, these are often costly and require additional hardware. Behavioral biometrics, in which users are verified, based on their keyboard and mouse activities, present potentially a good solution. In this paper we discuss the problem of Identity Theft and propose behavioral biometrics as a solution. We survey existing studies and list the challenges and propose solutions. ...|$|R
2500|$|Many mailbox {{providers}} are also access providers, {{while others are}} not (e.g., Yahoo! Mail, Outlook.com, Gmail, AOL Mail, Po box). [...] The definition given in RFC 6650 covers email hosting services, {{as well as the}} relevant department of companies, universities, organizations, groups, and individuals that manage their mail servers themselves. [...] The task is typically accomplished by implementing Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and possibly providing access to messages through Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), the Post Office Protocol, <b>Webmail,</b> or a proprietary protocol.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{operators}} of particular web applications (e.g. forums and <b>webmail)</b> allow users to utilize a limited subset of HTML markup. When accepting HTML input from users (say, <b>very</b> large), output encoding (such as &lt;b&gt;very&lt;/b&gt; large) will not suffice since the user input {{needs to be}} rendered as HTML by the browser (so it shows as [...] "very large", instead of [...] "<b>very</b> large"). Stopping an XSS attack when accepting HTML input from users is much more complex in this situation. Untrusted HTML input must be run through an HTML sanitization engine {{to ensure that it}} does not contain XSS code.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} usage {{problems}} of Online Collaborative Groupware (OCG) tools for learning at the University of Bahrain (UOB) in the Kingdom of Bahrain. An initial {{study revealed that}} the main problems faced by students when they use OCG tools {{in the learning process}} are security and trust. SWFG (Skype, Wiki, Facebook, and Gmail) tools were proposed as being effective and commonly used OCG tools for learning. A quasi-experiment has been done with UOB students to identify the perceptions of the students towards security, privacy and safety relating to use of SWFG tools. Based on this experiment the researcher has derived the following results:  Secure Skype has a positive relationship with Skype usage;  Private Skype has a positive relationship with Skype trust;  Secure Gmail has a negative relationship with Gmail usage and trust;  Wiki usage has a negative relationship with trust in Wikis. Additionally, the research revealed that students may be more motivated to use OCG tools if the security and privacy of these tools was to be improved. The thesis also focuses on security and trust within email. In order to evaluate the usage of secure emails, students‘ awareness of the secure email awareness was investigated using quantitative and qualitative methods. The results of this evaluation informed the design of an experiment that was then conducted by tracking secure email usage and gathering information about the students‘ usage and awareness of their secure emails. The aim of this activity was to identify a clear representation of secure email usage over specified periods for both academic and non-academic purposes by students in both the UK and Bahrain. It has been concluded from this experiment that there are differences between the usage of secure email in each country when applied to both academic and non-academic purposes. Finally, based on these results, the researcher developed a framework which derives from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) model by testing security and trust effects on the ease of use and on usefulness. A case study has been conducted using a new secure email instructional model in order to validate the research framework. The study found that security provided by <b>webmails</b> and students‘ trust affects the <b>webmail‘s</b> perceived usefulness, and that in turn this leads to ease of use regardless of which type of email client is used. However, it was not proof that usefulness affects the usage of email. Evidence suggests that the model may be a suitable solution for increasing the usefulness of email in Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), and can help to strengthen communication between faculty and students. This study has contributed valuable knowledge and information in this particular field of study. It has been able to gather a satisfactory amount of information from both students and teachers in both the University of Bahrain (UOB) and the University of Warwick (UOW). A number of different methods were used in this task – interviews, questionnaires, observations, experiments and student feedback, amongst others. The entire study was conducted {{in a way that it}} would empirically evaluate different dimensions of secure Online Collaborative Groupware (OCG) tools usage in the educational environment. The research framework applied in this investigation provided many insights into OCG tools. These new insights and information may be used to test and validate the framework with a large number of students...|$|R
40|$|The new {{information}} and communication technologies have been growing enormously {{in the last few years}} providing many different tools that the learning professionals should be aware of as our new role as teachers is already being defined by the existence of these tools. It would be handy to know which tools are the best to be used in our foreign language classrooms, in order to create, modify or complete our toolboxes, at least whereas all these tools are there at hand for free. Our presentation will start with the difference between Web 1. 0 and Web 2. 0 in order to understand the great change and challenge the social web represents and the possibilities to be used in a foreign language classroom. We will classify these new tools in four categories according to their content: Tools to create resources (mainly weblogs and wikis) tools to share those resources (podcasting, videocasting, online presentations, <b>webmailing,</b> instant messenger and voice call, photo albums and geoapplications) tools to organize and recover content (tags, social bookmarking, RSS readers) and the social network (facebook, linkedin…). We will try to define their main features and uses, their main advantages and implications in order to prove how useful they can be for the learning and teaching of a foreign language. We will try to convey the idea that, once overcome the anxiety provoked by the amount of tools at our disposal, the time has come for us to chose some of those tools, so that we can help our students to become competent in reading, writing, speaking and listening in a foreign language...|$|R

5000|$|S/MIME is {{sometimes}} considered not properly suited for use via <b>webmail</b> clients.

This issue is not fully specific to S/MIME: other secure methods of signing <b>webmail</b> may also require a browser to execute code to produce the signature; exceptions are PGP Desktop and versions of GnuPG, which will grab the data out of the <b>webmail,</b> sign it {{by means of a}} clipboard, and put the signed data back into the <b>webmail</b> page. Seen from the view of security this is a more secure solution.
