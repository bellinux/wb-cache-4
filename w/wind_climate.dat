50|$|Windthrow {{is common}} in all forested {{parts of the world}} that {{experience}} storms or high wind speeds. The risk of windthrow to a tree is related to the tree's size (height and diameter), the 'sail area' presented by its crown, the anchorage provided by its roots, its exposure to the wind, and the local <b>wind</b> <b>climate.</b> A common way of quantifying the risk of windthrow to a forest area is to model the probability or 'return time' of a wind speed that would damage those trees at that location. Tree senescence can also be a factor, where multiple factors contributing to the declining health of a tree reduce its anchorage and therefore increase its susceptibility to windthrow. The resulting damage can be a significant factor {{in the development of a}} forest.|$|E
50|$|Carl Rathjens also {{initiated}} {{the establishment of}} a meteorological station. The Imam agreed to his project and nominated him {{to be in charge of}} erecting the station. He was given fifty soldiers to assist him. Rathjens started by drawing a plan of the building, but he himself had to look for wood in the remote outlying districts of Sanaa and to bring the material into the capital. He ordered straw from the region of Hodeida for covering the roof. The station was established in only a few months. The Wetter Dienst (“weather service”) station in Hamburg donated many measuring instruments and which Rathjens brought to Yemen. In the station, Rathjens and his students collected data on <b>wind,</b> <b>climate,</b> temperatures and precipitation three times a day. The results were sent by telegraph to the weather service station in Hamburg. This was another innovation that Rathjens brought to Yemen and which contributed to the modernization of the country. Although Rathjens was not the first to collect information on weather and climate in Yemen, his work can be recognized as pioneering work in the sense that it was initiated and supported by the state. Such data had already been collected in the past by a previous scholar, Carsten Niebuhr, who in 1763 measured the effects of temperature and precipitation during his first few weeks in Yemen. Eduard Glaser, who had spent more time in Sana’a and had visited Yemen many times at the end of the 19th century, also brought from Germany instruments to measure the temperature, the humidity and the precipitation. Glaser did it from the balcony of a guest house in which he lived. While Niebuhr’s and Glaser’s work in this field was pioneering in a way, their work was of short duration and lacked the means for making comparisons with the data which they had collected over a longer period of time. Rathjens’ plan, however, was that the work at the station would continue for a long period. Therefore, he trained a local group to handle the operations of collecting and transmitting data.|$|E

40|$|The Silvertop Towers {{project is}} a {{comprehensive}} redevelopment project of three high-rise residential buildings {{in the city of}} Antwerp (Flanders, Belgium). As part of this project, pedestrian passages will be constructed through each of the towers to improve the accessibility and to increase social control on the site. Experience, wind tunnel modeling and numerical modeling have indicated that wind conditions in passages are often unfavorable. This paper presents the assessment of <b>wind</b> <b>climate</b> and especially the study that has been performed to modify the <b>wind</b> <b>climate</b> in the passages of the Silvertop Towers. The assessment of <b>wind</b> <b>climate</b> is conducted with the aid of numerical modeling with Computational Fluid Dynamics. The <b>wind</b> <b>climate</b> is assessed to be highly unacceptable. Remedial action is imperative. Various traditional remedial measures to improve the <b>wind</b> <b>climate</b> are contemplated. These solutions either provide an insufficient improvement of <b>wind</b> <b>climate</b> or conflict with the envisaged architectural design. Therefore a rather unconventional solution has been selected. We have designed and analyzed an automatic control system to modify the <b>wind</b> <b>climate</b> in the passages. The actuators of the system are sliding doors that are mounted {{at both ends of the}} passage. The opening and closing of the doors is controlled by a decision algorithm based on local wind measurements. At least one of the doors will be closed when the control system senses that the threshold wind speed in the passage is exceeded. The control system will ensure an adequate <b>wind</b> <b>climate</b> without conflicting with the original architectural design. The passages are estimated to be opened for about 50 - 70 % of the time. Estimates for the fraction of time that door control is imperfect (doors are closed instead of open and vice versa) are also give...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{variations in}} the <b>wind</b> <b>climate</b> in relation {{to changes in the}} impact of wind erosion on agricultural lands with Scania, the southernmost province of Sweden, as an example. The literature concerning wind erosion in the region is reviewed and the conclusions are linked to recent analyses of the regional <b>wind</b> <b>climate.</b> Presently, wind erosion occasionally induces problems in light soil areas of the intensively cultivated Scania. It is not a new phenomenon that results from modem farming practice; it was documented already in the 18 th century. This was an era of major land use changes because the increasing population required new and more vulnerable areas to be cultivated, which resulted in an ecological crisis due to increased wind erosion. Partly overlapping in time, a series of land amalgamation reforms transformed the land-use resulting in larger fields. Analyses of the frequency of wind directions indicate that {{variations in the}} large-scale <b>wind</b> <b>climate</b> occurred at that time. Wind erosion again became a topic of concern in the 20 th century. Extensive analyses of several aspects of the <b>wind</b> <b>climate</b> (e. g., storminess and cyclone intensity) of Scandinavia and northwestern Europe show that there have been interdecadal variations but no sign of an overall long-term trend. The recurring periods of intensified wind erosion problems can best be explained as the combined result of a varying <b>wind</b> <b>climate</b> and the lack of appropriate long-term maintenance strategies for protective measures through the intervening periods of benign <b>wind</b> <b>climate.</b> (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|The {{maturity}} of LiDAR technology {{means that it}} can now replace a traditional tall mast for on-site wind measurement campaigns. Since LiDAR {{does not require the}} same extensive permitting as a mast, the campaign can begin much faster. And it is even possible to characterise the annual <b>wind</b> <b>climate</b> without a full 12 -months of measurements. This can help wind farm developers to speed up projects in their pipeline. The <b>wind</b> <b>climate</b> varies a lot through the seasons and, despite advances in Measure-Correlate-Predict (MCP) techniques, this seasonality significantly affects estimates of the long-term <b>wind</b> <b>climate.</b> Measuring on-site for only a single season (3 months) can lead to a difference of ± 10 % in the calculated long-term mean wind speed. To remove this seasonal bias, it is common practice to measure on-site for a period of 12 -months. However, this campaign design does not take full advantage of the ease of re-deployment of a LiDAR. Ecofys has designed a wind measurement campaign that samples the <b>wind</b> <b>climate</b> in all four seasons. 6 months of on-site measurements are divided into four periods, with the resultant estimate of long-term <b>wind</b> <b>climate</b> differing by only ± 1 % relative to a 12 -month campaign. This makes excellent use of LiDAR investment, reducing campaign costs by about 35 %. And it is also more time efficient, as the LiDAR is available for 6 months, allowing either a concurrent campaign at a second site or a number of other uses. This example illustrates how beneficial it can be to re-think wind measurement strategies in light of the latest technological and industry developments...|$|E

The current analysis {{has been used to}} propose geometric predictive formulas for stable salients that overcome some limitations affecting previous works. A semi-probabilistic method based on well-known rate-of-change statistics is also presented to verify the equilibrium condition of salients. Analysis results suggest that site-specific wave transmission in the lee of submerged reefs requires a range of salient limiting B/S ratio values broader than those presented in the literature, B being the length of the obstacle and S the distance between undisturbed beach and obstacle. The B/S ratio has been proved to be the main dimensionless variable for predicting salient amplitude and basalwidth. In particular, the proposed predictive equation suggests an erosion condition for some combinations of B/Sand the “ 8 times rule” appears not to be applicable to natural salients...|$|R
40|$|An extreme loading {{study has}} been {{conducted}} comprising a general <b>wind</b> <b>climate</b> analysis {{as well as a}} wind turbine reliability study. In the <b>wind</b> <b>climate</b> analysis, the distribution of the (horizontal) turbulence standard deviation, conditioned on the mean wind speed, has been approximated by fitting a three parameter Weibull distribution to the measured on-shore and off-shore data for wind speed variations. Specific recommendations on off-shore design turbulence intensities are lacking in the present IEC-code. Based on the present analysis of the off-shore <b>wind</b> <b>climate</b> on two shallow water sites, a design turbulence intensity for off-shore application is proposed which, in the IEC code framework, is applicable for extreme as well as for fatigue load determination. In order to establish a rational method to analyse wind turbine components with respect to failure in ultimate loading, and in addition to establish partial safety factors for design of such components against this failure mode, structural reliability methods must be applied. This type of analysis accounts for the variability of the external (wind) loading (a...|$|E
