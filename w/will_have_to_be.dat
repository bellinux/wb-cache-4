5|$|The {{classification}} {{most commonly}} adopted is that proposed by Beier in 1968. He divided the order into eight families. Klass, in 1997, studied the external male genitalia and postulated that the families Chaeteessidae and Metallyticidae diverged {{from the other}} families at an early date. However, the Mantidae and Thespidae are both polyphyletic, so the Mantodea <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> revised.|$|E
5|$|As {{the regular}} sacrifices {{continue}} the islanders approach the king for help, {{as they are}} worried there will soon be no young girls left.

During the ten-week period of grace before the princess has to be sacrificed, messengers are despatched to every corner of the realm offering the kingdom, marriage to the princess, and the magic sword the king had inherited from the god Odin.|$|E

5|$|Finally, the Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} if free speech is to be favoured over the protection of reputation in applying a Reynolds-type defence, another issue that <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considered is what balance should be struck between the two competing interests. In this connection, Chan C.J. said that the court would {{have to decide whether}} freedom of expression is to be given preference over the protection of reputation, whether it is a fundamental right that trumps the protection of reputation unless it is shown that the defamatory statement was made maliciously, or whether it is co-equal with the protection of reputation.|$|E
5|$|A remorseful Leslie (Amy Poehler) tells a {{group of}} Recreation Center {{teachers}} the Pawnee budget has been cut by $1,000, and five of their classes <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cut, but exactly which classes {{has not yet been}} determined. Later, Leslie and Justin Anderson (Justin Theroux), who have been dating for weeks, have another excellent date in Indianapolis. At the end of the night, they decide their next date will be in Pawnee, and Leslie feels pressure to make their date equally exciting. While talking later with Ann (Rashida Jones), Leslie decides to host a dinner party at her home with all her interesting friends. She invites Mark (Paul Schneider), Tom (Aziz Ansari) and Ron (Nick Offerman), specifically excludes Jerry (Jim O'Heir), and asks Andy (Chris Pratt) to work as the waiter. Andy agrees, even though he hates Justin, Ann's former crush, and Mark, her current boyfriend.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{its status}} an {{international}} language, English is expeditious {{when it comes}} adopting foreign words, and borrows vocabulary from {{a large number of}} other sources. Early studies of English vocabulary by lexicographers, the scholars who formally study vocabulary, compile dictionaries, or both, were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from good-quality linguistic corpora, collections of actual written texts and spoken passages. Many statements published {{before the end of the}} 20th century about the growth of English vocabulary over time, the dates of first use of various words in English, and the sources of English vocabulary <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> corrected as new computerised analysis of linguistic corpus data becomes available.|$|E
5|$|Throughout a {{great and}} open area, not only {{will there be a}} greater chance of {{favourable}} variations, arising from the large number of individuals of the same species there supported, but the conditions of life are much more complex from the large number of already existing species; and if some of these species become modified and improved, others <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> improved in a corresponding degree, or they will be exterminated. Each new form, also, as soon as it has been improved, will be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and will thus come into competition with many other forms... the new forms produced on large areas, which have already been victorious over many competitors, will be those that will spread most widely, and will give rise to the greatest number of new varieties and species. They will thus play a more important role in the changing history of the organic world.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{story begins}} on {{the outset of}} summer vacation. Hazumu's {{homeroom}} teacher Namiko Tsuki suggests Hazumu and her friends take a one-week trip to a small mountain village with a hot spring resort. Hazumu's grandparents reside in this town, and are two new characters introduced to the story. Three other female characters are introduced as possible love interests for Hazumu; two are {{the same age as}} her, and the third is the older landlady of the resort. The goal of the game is to pair Hazumu up with one of the five female cast of characters. The gameplay's main system comes from Hazumu's indecisive personality. If the player shows more interest in a particular character, the other characters get annoyed that Hazumu is ignoring them, which is displayed in a tension meter. The more Hazumu ignores a particular character, the higher the tension between that character becomes. This ensures Hazumu stays good friends with the possible love interests. In order to view the ending of a particular character, a certain amount of tension <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> between the other characters, but this cannot be too great or the ending will not show.|$|E

40|$|Brito (2010) {{proposes a}} naturalistic {{analysis}} of morality, disagreeing with some authors who postulate an insurmountable is-ought gap. Here, we present his main arguments and advance some criticisms to them. Brito’s strategy consists in grounding the normative notion of ought on volitive notions, like “will” and “want”. In his perspective, {{to reach the}} moral level, a <b>will</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> directed <b>to</b> itself and to all other wills. We try to show that this strategy fails, since moral normativity cannot be grounded on subjective phenomena, regardless {{of the contents of}} these phenomena. We also show some incoherence in Brito’s ideias about the possibility of is-ought reduction, as he seems to advocate that it <b>is</b> not possible <b>to</b> reduce “ought” to “is” while he also proposes the reduction of oughts to facts about volition...|$|R
