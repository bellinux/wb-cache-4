5|$|After Naomi (Marsha Thomason) parachuted {{onto the}} island in season three, the {{producers}} began to plan who else {{would be on the}} freighter she came from. They wanted these new characters to be scientists, who <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in finding the island for their own personal reasons. They decided to create a character who <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in lost civilizations, and named her Charlotte Staples Lewis as a reference to C. S. Lewis, which Lost producer Damon Lindelof said was a clue to the direction the show would be taking during season four.|$|E

5|$|The game {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} upon release. Critics praised the game's colourful visuals, boss battles and special effects, but most cited its poor control schemes, aesthetics and general gameplay as major flaws. Despite the mixed reception, Iizuka commented that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> {{in making a}} third Nights game, should Sega commission one.|$|E

Deadline reported that Javier Bardem and Angelina Jolie are still attached to the movie as Frankenstein's monster and the film's reluctant bride, respectively. The same month Condon stated that should Jolie decide to leave the project, he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in seeing Gal Gadot play the titular character.|$|E
5|$|The casting of Hopper, the film's villain, proved problematic. Lasseter's top {{choice was}} Robert De Niro, who {{repeatedly}} turned the part down, as did {{a succession of}} other actors. Kevin Spacey met John Lasseter at the 1995 Academy Awards and Lasseter asked Spacey if he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in doing the voice of Hopper. Spacey was delighted and signed on immediately.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} of Kansas Saloon Smashers was Edwin S. Porter, a projectionist {{who came to}} work for Edison as a cameraman in 1900. Eventually, Porter became the director responsible for all of Edison Studios' output. Porter based the set off of {{a photograph of a}} wrecked saloon which appeared in the Journal, while the characters and plot were based on editorial cartoons published in the paper. Porter frequently read the publication when he wanted inspiration on topics that filmgoers <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in.|$|E

5|$|Directly {{prior to}} The Beatles' first American visit, Brian Epstein {{wanted someone to}} manage the {{escalating}} volume of merchandising requests that NEMS found itself unable to cope with, and asked his lawyer, David Jacobs, to oversee this task. Jacobs knew Nicky Byrne {{and asked him if}} he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in taking over the merchandising subdivision from NEMS altogether, paying NEMS a commission. Byrne accepted the offer subject to a 90% rate, leaving only 10% for the Beatles and NEMS combined. Completely unaware of the potential market that existed, particularly in America, Epstein agreed to the deal, and subsequently lost The Beatles an estimated $100,000,000 in possible income.|$|E
5|$|Lynch {{also met}} Stuart Cornfeld during this time. Cornfeld had enjoyed Eraserhead and was {{interested}} in producing Ronnie Rocket; Cornfeld was working for Mel Brooks and Brooksfilms at the time, and when the two realized that Ronnie Rocket was unlikely to find sufficient financing to be produced, Lynch asked to see some already-written scripts to work from for his next film instead. Cornfeld found four scripts he felt Lynch <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in, but on hearing {{the name of the}} first, the director decided his next project would be The Elephant Man.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequel to}} Nights into Dreams with the working title Air Nights was {{originally}} outlined for the Sega Saturn and subsequently {{developed for the}} Dreamcast with motion control being a central element of gameplay. In an August 1999 interview, Yuji Naka confirmed that a sequel was in development, but by December 2000 the project had been cancelled. Naka expressed reluctance to develop a sequel after the Dreamcast's discontinuation, but later noted in 2003 that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in using the licence of Nights into Dreams to reinforce Sega's identity as a video game developer. Discussion concerning a new game in the series had increased in frequency by 2006. Rumours regarding a Wii version continued to appear when a list of upcoming games was published by Japanese developer G.rev, which included an unspecified Nights title. Before the development of Journey of Dreams, Naka confirmed in retrospective interviews that he had intended to base the next Nights game around a unique motion controller.|$|E

5|$|After Roosevelt's {{death and}} Truman's {{succession}} to the Presidency, Minton continued offering {{advice to the}} new administration {{on a range of}} topics, including patronage and political maneuvering. Truman appointed Minton as head of the War Department Clemency Board, a panel of judges charged with overseeing reviews of decisions made by the courts-martial. The panel met every two weeks which, along with his responsibilities on the circuit court, kept Minton very busy and afforded him little rest, leading to a deterioration in his health. While yachting with President Truman on Memorial Day in 1945, Truman asked Minton to accept an appointment to the position of Solicitor General of the United States. Minton declined because of his health, but he told Truman he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in a seat on the Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Atlanta in September 1864, President Davis {{considered}} replacing John Bell Hood {{in command of the}} Army of Tennessee and he asked Robert E. Lee to find out if Beauregard <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested.</b> Beauregard was indeed interested, but it is unclear whether Davis seriously considered the appointment, and in the end decided to retain Hood. Davis met with Beauregard in Augusta, Georgia, on October 2 and offered him command of the newly created Department of the West, responsible for the five Southern states from Georgia to the Mississippi River, with the armies of Hood and Richard Taylor under his ostensible command. However, it was a thankless job that was limited to logistical and advisory responsibilities, without true operational control of the armies unless he should join them in person during an emergency. Nevertheless, anxious to return to the field, he accepted the assignment.|$|E
5|$|Ament and Gossard were {{devastated by}} the death of Wood and the {{resulting}} demise of Mother Love Bone. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder-edged than what he had been doing previously. After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist Mike McCready, whose band, Shadow, had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to reconnect with Ament. After practicing for a while, the trio sent out a five-song demo tape in order to find a singer and a drummer. They gave former Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons the demo to see if he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in joining the band and to distribute the demo to anyone he felt might fit the lead vocal position.|$|E

5|$|Both Walt Disney Pictures and DreamWorks {{bid for the}} US {{distribution}} rights. Eventually, Disney won {{the rights}} to dub the English adaptation of Spirited Away, {{under the supervision of}} Pixar animator John Lasseter. A Miyazaki fan, Lasseter would sit with his staff and watch Miyazaki's work when encountering story problems, and at one point they did so with Spirited Away, which impressed Lasseter. Upon hearing his reaction to the film, people at Disney asked Lasseter if he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in trying to bring Spirited Away to an American audience. Lasseter agreed to be executive producer for English adaptation. Soon, several others began to join the project: Beauty and the Beast co-director Kirk Wise and Aladdin co-producer Donald W. Ernst joined Lasseter as director and producer of Spirited Away respectively. Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H. Hewitt penned the English-language dialogue, which they wrote to match the characters' original Japanese-language lip movements.|$|E
5|$|Free-labor proponents in the East {{also wanted}} to create a similar {{organization}} in the western states. In the 1840s members of the Salem Free Produce Association approached Coffin to see if he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in managing the proposed Western Free Produce Association. At first he declined, saying he lacked the money required to fund the venture, and {{that he did not want}} to move into the city. In 1845 a group of abolitionist businessmen opened a wholesale mercantile business in Cincinnati and the Free Produce Association raised $3,000 to help stock the new warehouse with goods. Different groups continued to pressure Coffin to accept a position as the new business's director, claiming there were no other western abolitionists qualified to manage the enterprise. Reluctantly, he finally agreed to oversee the warehouse for five years, in which time he could train someone else to run it, and in 1847 Levi and Catharine Coffin moved to Ohio.|$|E

He did hint to state party leaders that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in running for Indiana governor in the 1908 election. He soon gained the support of several key labor unions, and was endorsed by Louis Ludlow, {{a reporter for the}} Indianapolis Star. Despite this support, Marshall was a dark horse candidate at the state convention. Initially, Thomas Taggart, Indiana Democratic Party boss, did not support him because of Marshall's support of prohibition. Taggart wanted the party to nominate anti-prohibitionist Samuel Ralston, but the prohibitionist and anti-Taggart factions united with Marshall's supporters. Taggart swung Ralston's delegates in support of Marshall to oppose L. Ert Slack, a temperance candidate, giving Marshall the votes he needed to win the nomination.|$|E

A self-taught musician, he began {{to play the piano}} when he was between the ages of eleven and twelve years old, and he did not take any formal piano lessons. He has an older sister who also played the piano. After graduating from Kanagawa University with a degree in English, Uematsu played the {{keyboard}} in several amateur bands and composed music for television commercials. When Uematsu was working at a music rental shop in Tokyo, a Square employee asked if he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in creating music for some of the titles they were working on. Although he agreed, Uematsu at the time considered it a side job, and he did not think it would become a full-time career. He said {{it was a way to}} make some money on the side, while also keeping his part-time job at the music rental shop.|$|E

With some trepidation, she went to the show and managed Tony Atlas in his match against Jimmy Snuka. Psaltis made her professional wrestling debut in January 1995. She met her future fiancé Simon Diamond during her time in the independent wrestling promotions. She also met Buddy Landell and Devon Storm, both of whom helped train her. Psaltis spent four years working on the northeastern independent circuit, appearing with promotions such as Maryland Championship Wrestling and the Mid-Eastern Wrestling Federation.|$|E
5|$|Written by Donald Tosh. Beginning life as The Rosacrutians, {{this story}} came about after Tosh {{contacted}} the production staff in early 1968 {{to see if}} they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>interested</b> in him pitching a script. Initial discussion saw the story begin as a story featuring Jamie and Victoria, but by the time Tosh delivered the first materials for the story Patrick Troughton had already decided to depart the series. At the point it was turned down by the production team Tosh had completed a script for the first episode and notes for the subsequent three episodes. Tosh completed a full storyline for DWM in 1994. Set on an Earth Space station it deals with a conflict between the staff of the station and the Rosemariners, a group who plan to hold the staff hostage in return for Earth supplying them with sophisticated weapons. It was later adapted by Tosh for Big Finish's The Lost Stories range in September 2012.|$|E
