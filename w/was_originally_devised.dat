5|$|The series <b>was</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> by {{the then}} {{in-house}} development team at BBC Entertainment Events and was {{announced by the}} BBC in April 2006. BBC One broadcast the programme, which was hosted by Graham Norton, on Saturday evenings from 29 July through 16 September 2006.|$|E
25|$|According to The Official Dr. Who & the Daleks Book, Sara Kingdom <b>was</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> by Terry Nation as a {{supporting}} {{character in a}} proposed American-produced spin-off of Doctor Who that would have focused on Kingdom and her colleagues fighting the Daleks. A 30-minute script titled The Destroyers was created for a potential pilot episode which was never produced.|$|E
25|$|The snowball Earth {{hypothesis}} <b>was</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> {{to explain}} geological {{evidence for the}} apparent presence of glaciers at tropical latitudes. According to modelling, an ice-albedo feedback would result in glacial ice rapidly advancing to the equator once the glaciers spread to within 25° to 30° of the equator. Therefore, the presence of glacial deposits within the tropics suggests global ice cover.|$|E
5000|$|The four {{ships were}} {{built for the}} Royal Banana Monopoly Business (Regia Azienda Monopolio Banane). These ships <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> as [...] "banana boats" [...] for {{transporting}} refrigerated bananas from Somaliland and Eritrea in Italian East Africa.|$|R
50|$|These {{reflections}} <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> by Vice Admiral Hajime Matsushita, {{who was the}} Chief of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy , {{and used}} from 1932 to its abolishment in 1945. Every evening cadets are expected to meditate on these inter-related questions.|$|R
50|$|Australian railway telegraphic codes <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> {{to reduce}} the size of telegraphic messages, though some have survived into the {{telephone}} era. They were basically used in telegrams between locations in a railway network of offices, stations and other parts of the railway system.|$|R
25|$|Elementary {{set theory}} {{can be studied}} informally and {{intuitive}}ly, and so can be taught in primary schools using Venn diagrams. The intuitive approach tacitly assumes that a set may be formed from the class of all objects satisfying any particular defining condition. This assumption gives rise to paradoxes, the simplest and best known of which are Russell's paradox and the Burali-Forti paradox. Axiomatic set theory <b>was</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> to rid set theory of such paradoxes.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that the Galloway boiler was not entirely the work of the {{brothers}} as they sought the advice of Robert Armstrong, a consulting engineer, in 1850 and it was he who arranged for the boiler to be exhibited in 1851. Similarly, Sekon notes that at least one Galloway patent relating to boilers <b>was</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> by another person: Timothy Hackworth's 1830 design for the boiler of his locomotive The Globe was later patented by the Galloways for use with stationary steam engines.|$|E
25|$|Close Combat by Atomic Games <b>was</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> as a {{computer}} game version of ASL. Atomic Games had already developed several games for Avalon Hill, however, with Avalon Hill embroiled in a financial crisis that would ultimately lead to its demise, Atomic Games took what work they had completed, severed ties with the board game franchise and completed the game's development for Microsoft. The first three Close Combat games were notable, at the time, for being among the few games published by Microsoft. The final two games in the original series were, however, published by Strategic Simulations, Inc.|$|E
50|$|GPUs <b>are</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> to {{accelerate}} image processing and video stream rendering. Moreover, since modern GPUs have good {{ability to perform}} numeric computations in parallel with a relatively low cost and better energy efficiency, GPUs are becoming a popular alternative to replace supercomputers performing multidimensional DSP.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{advances}} in Information Technology, nowadays {{it is easy}} to collect, store, process and share data. In effect, the amount of data stored by organizations or indi-viduals is estimated to be growing exponentially [Lyman, 2003]. While Expert Sys-tems (ES) <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> to solely mimic human experts [Buchanan, 1986]...|$|R
5000|$|... d'Inverno was an {{original}} trustee {{and the first}} chairman of the charity Safe Ground in 1994, which in more recent years or so has developed a range of courses that <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> by prisoners that have been delivered in {{a large number of}} UK prisons including Family Man and Father's Inside.|$|R
25|$|The Triumph Spitfire <b>was</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> by Standard-Triumph {{to compete}} in the small sports car market that had opened up with the {{introduction}} of the Austin-Healey Sprite. The Sprite had used the basic drive train of the Austin A30/A35 in a light body to make up a budget sports car; Triumph's idea was to use the mechanicals from their small saloon, the Herald, to underpin the new project, this made the vehicle a classic Parts bin special. Triumph had one advantage, however; where the Austin A30 range was of unitary construction, the Herald featured a separate chassis. It was Triumph's intention to cut that chassis down and clothe it in a sports body, saving the costs of developing a completely new chassis/body unit.|$|E
25|$|The writ <b>was</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> in England as a {{means of}} {{rectifying}} the unjust situation arising from the fact that any allowable method of appeal at common law was limited only to review for errors of law. There were no remedies for errors of fact which were not apparent on the record and unknown to the court at the time of trial, and which would have brought about a different result. Like all writs in those days, it issued out of the Court of Chancery and was addressed to the court in which the judgment had been entered, imploring that tribunal to recognize the error and correct the judgment. Later it was obtained by motion to the trial court itself. The writ’s use in the English courts had few limitations as there were no restrictions whether the petitioner was a prisoner or not and it did not depend on whether the case was criminal or civil.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} <b>was</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> as [...] "the fantasy girlfriend", and {{was constructed}} as an amalgamation of writer Mike Bullen's female friends. As {{the series was}} developed, input into Rachel's storylines was provided by Cold Feets producers Andy Harries and Christine Langan; Rachel and Adam attempt in vitro fertilisation in the third series, which Harries {{and his wife had}} also tried. It was originally planned for Rachel and Adam to adopt a child during the fourth series, but Helen Baxendale's real-life pregnancy meant the storyline had to be rewritten.|$|E
50|$|Dialyte lenses {{have a wide}} {{air space}} between the two {{elements}}. They <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> in the 19th century to allow much smaller flint glass elements down stream since flint glass was hard to produce and expensive. They are also lenses where R2 and R3 can not be cemented because they have dissimilar curvatures.|$|R
50|$|The APL {{programming}} language is distinctive in being symbolic rather than lexical: its primitives are denoted by symbols, not words. These symbols <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> as a mathematical notation to describe algorithms. APL programmers often assign informal names when discussing functions and operators (for example, product for ×/) but the core functions and operators {{provided by the}} language are denoted by non-textual symbols.|$|R
5000|$|Hasse {{diagrams}} {{are named}} after Helmut Hasse (1898-1979); according to , {{they are so}} called because of the effective use Hasse made of them. However, Hasse {{was not the first}} to use these diagrams. One example that predates Hasse can be found in [...] Although Hasse diagrams <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> as a technique for making drawings of partially ordered sets by hand, they have more recently been created automatically using graph drawing techniques.|$|R
500|$|The {{character}} of Raynor <b>was</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> by Chris Metzen and James Phinney, with his depiction as a rough-living and dangerous man developed through various pieces of concept art by Metzen. In an interview, Raynor's voice actor Robert Clotworthy cited {{one piece of}} this concept art in how he decided to voice the character. The art, showing Raynor on a hoverbike and outfitted with futuristic weaponry, gave Clotworthy the impression that as Raynor was someone people [...] "wouldn't mess with", {{he would not have}} to raise his voice as [...] "other characters [...] shut up and listen" [...] or face the consequences. Clotworthy also stated that in the event that a StarCraft film was produced, he believed Clive Owen would be the perfect choice to play Raynor due to him [...] "being dangerous".|$|E
500|$|In February–June 1872, Railroad Gazette {{published}} {{a series of}} articles written by a person using the pen name [...] "Hindoo", and reader comments in response to the articles. Hindoo was a British colonial official who was visiting the United States, who stated that the Indian railway system very rarely had problems with head-on and rear-end collisions, which were more frequent in the United States. Hindoo proposed that this was due to the manner in which Indian train stations dispatched trains using telegraphs, in which a system was used whereby each train station acted as a [...] "blocking point." [...] This blocking point system <b>was</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> by the British railroad industry, and forbade trains from leaving a station until a telegraph was received from the next station stating that the line was clear, upon which a clearance card was issued to the train operator. Hindoo felt that the U.S. system placed too much responsibility upon a single dispatcher, who would [...] "oversee all freight and passenger train movements on a division." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{information}} theory, entropy is {{the measure}} of the amount of information that is missing before reception and is sometimes referred to as Shannon entropy. Shannon entropy is a broad and general concept which finds applications in information theory as well as thermodynamics. It <b>was</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> by Claude Shannon in 1948 to study the amount of information in a transmitted message. The definition of the information entropy is, however, quite general, and is expressed in terms of a discrete set of probabilities pi so that ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{a result}} of the flintlock's long active life, it has left lasting marks on the {{language}} and on drill and parade. Terms such as: [...] "lock, stock and barrel", [...] "going off half-cocked" [...] and [...] "flash in the pan" [...] remain current in the English language. In addition, the weapon positions and drill commands that <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> to standardize carrying, loading and firing a flintlock weapon remain the standard for drill and display (see manual of arms).|$|R
5000|$|Cinema {{sound systems}} became capable of high-fidelity reproduction, {{particularly}} after {{the adoption of}} Dolby Stereo. These systems <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> as gimmicks to increase theater attendance, but their widespread implementation created a content vacuum {{that had to be}} filled by competent professionals. Before stereo soundtracks, film sound was of such low fidelity that only the dialogue and occasional sound effects were practical. The greater dynamic range of the new systems, coupled with the ability to produce sounds at the sides or behind the audience, required more creativity.|$|R
40|$|A highly useful {{recording}} system of atmospheric pressure data is devised by introducing {{a computer and}} its apparatus is made practically. The key features of the apparatus are put on its automation and the manifoldness of recording modes. Besides, automatic-graphing mode of the analogue recorder <b>is</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised.</b> The atmospheric pressure data punched on paper tapes {{are expected to be}} used widely and effectively in the various fields of cosmic ray physics, atmospheric physics, other appropriate scientific researches and student education by using a computer or a microcomputer functionally...|$|R
6000|$|After all, the {{question}} still recurs upon us, How did that fraud originally {{get into the}} State Register? Lanphier then, as now, was the editor of that paper. Lanphier knows. Lanphier cannot be ignorant of how and by whom it was originally concocted. Can he be induced to tell, or, if he has told, can Judge Douglas be induced to tell how it originally was concocted? It may be true that Lanphier insists {{that the two men}} for whose benefit it <b>was</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> shall at least bear their share of it! How that is, I do not know, and while it remains unexplained I hope to be pardoned if I insist that the mere fact of Judge Douglas making charges against Trumbull and myself is not quite sufficient evidence to establish them! ...|$|E

50|$|In 1874, Thomas Cook {{introduced}} his 'circular notes', {{a product that}} <b>was</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> by a London banker in the 1770s and was later superseded by American Express's 'traveller's cheques'.|$|E
50|$|Clustering {{algorithms}} {{have been}} increasingly adopted in security applications to find dangerous or illicit activities. For instance, clustering of malware and computer viruses aims {{to identify and}} categorize different existing malware families, and to generate specific signatures for their detection by anti-viruses, or signature-based intrusion detection systems like Snort.However, clustering algorithms have not <b>been</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> to deal with deliberate attack attempts {{that are designed to}} subvert the clustering process itself. Whether clustering can be safely adopted in such settings thus remains questionable. Preliminary work reporting some vulnerability of clustering can be found in.|$|R
40|$|Non-oscillatory {{discretization}} methods {{based on}} the Local Extremum Diminishing principle, which <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> for compressible flow, are applied to the free-surface evolution equation. More specifically, both symmetric and upstream limited schemes are utilized in the calculation of the flow about the Series 60 hull, a naval frigate hull with sonar dome and transom stern, and a fully configured IACC yacht hull at an angle-ofattack. The new free surface discretization techniques improve the overall numerical approach which has become sufficiently accurate, robust, and efficient to be used routinely in a design environment...|$|R
40|$|Taylor impacts tests <b>were</b> <b>originally</b> <b>devised</b> to {{determine}} the dynamic yield strength of materials at moderate strain rates. More recently, such tests have been used extensively to validate numerical codes for the simulation of plastic deformation. In this work, we use the material point method to simulate a number of Taylor impact tests to compare different Johnson-Cook, Mechanical Threshold Stress, and Steinberg-Guinan-Cochran plasticity models and the vob Mises and Gurson-Tvergaard-Needleman yield conditions. In addition to room temperature Taylor tests, high temperature tests have been performed and compared with experimental data. ...|$|R
