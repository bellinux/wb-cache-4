5|$|Before the 2007 season, Alston {{competed with}} Ron <b>Warner</b> <b>and</b> Jabari Issa for a {{starting}} {{role on the}} Eskimos. He made the active roster and originally split time with <b>Warner</b> <b>and</b> Robert Brown as a defensive lineman. In August, Alston replaced Adam Braidwood as the starting defensive end, but he was injured with a hip pointer {{in his first game}} in that role. He experienced nagging injury concerns {{for the remainder of the}} season. He finished the season with 11 tackles, a sack, and a forced fumble over six games. The Eskimos released Alston shortly after the end of the 2007. Head coach Danny Maciocia cited Alston's history of injuries as a factor in his release from the team.|$|E

5|$|The Rooftop Telescope is a 9.5-inch {{refractor}} {{that was}} originally constructed in 1894 by <b>Warner</b> <b>and</b> Swasey {{for their own}} use. The telescope was the first instrument of the <b>Warner</b> <b>and</b> Swasey Observatory and was originally used at the Taylor Road facility, but was put into storage when the Astronomy Department of Case Western Reserve University was relocated to the A. W. Smith building on the main campus. In 1986 the telescope was reinstalled in a new dome {{on the roof of}} the A. W. Smith building.|$|E

5|$|A third {{attempt was}} planned for September 13; bad weather delayed {{attempts}} until September 16. However, General Schuyler was {{by this time}} so ill that he thought it necessary to withdraw to Ticonderoga. He left that day, turning full command of the invasion over to Montgomery. Schuyler {{was not the only}} one falling ill; the bad weather, and the swampy, malaria-infested terrain of Île-aux-Noix was also taking a toll on the troops, as more of them became ill as well. The bad news was tempered by good; an additional 250 troops, in the form of a company of Green Mountain Boys under Seth <b>Warner,</b> <b>and</b> another company of New Hampshire men under Colonel Timothy Bedel, arrived at Île-aux-Noix.|$|E
5|$|Baum's {{detachment}} was a mixed {{force of}} 700 composed primarily of Hessians but also including {{small amounts of}} dismounted Brunswick dragoons, Canadians, Loyalists, and Indians. He was sent by Burgoyne to raid Bennington in the disputed New Hampshire Grants area for horses, draft animals, provisions, and other supplies. Believing the town to be only lightly defended, Burgoyne and Baum were unaware that Stark and 1,500 militiamen were stationed there. After a rain-caused standoff, Stark's men enveloped Baum's position, taking many prisoners, and killing Baum. Reinforcements for both sides arrived as Stark and his men were mopping up, and the battle restarted, with <b>Warner</b> <b>and</b> Stark driving away Breymann's reinforcements with heavy casualties.|$|E

5|$|During this period, Colt {{received}} an extension on his patent {{since he did}} not collect {{on it in the}} early years. In 1852, gun makers James <b>Warner</b> <b>and</b> Massachusetts Arms infringed on the patent. Colt sued the companies and the court ordered that <b>Warner</b> <b>and</b> Massachusetts Arms cease revolver production. Colt then threatened to sue Allen & Thurber over the cylinder design of their double-action pepperbox revolver. However, Colt's lawyers doubted that this suit would have been successful and the case was resolved with a settlement of $15,000. Production of Allen pepperboxes continued until the expiration of Colt's patent in 1857. In 1854 Colt fought for his patent extension with the U.S. Congress, who launched a special committee to investigate charges that Colt had bribed government officials in securing this extension. By August he was exonerated and the story became national news when Scientific American reported that the fault was not with Colt, but with Washington politicians. With a virtual monopoly, Colt sold his pistols in Europe, where demand was high due to tense international relations. By telling each nation that the others were buying Colt's pistols, Colt was able to get large orders from many countries who feared falling behind in the arms race.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, Warner {{played one}} {{professional}} football {{game for the}} Syracuse Athletic Club during the first World Series of Football at Madison Square Garden. In the first professional indoor football game, Syracuse defeated the heavily favored New York team. During the series, Warner was seriously cut {{on the side of}} his head. Although he laughed it off at first, the injury turned out to be more serious and he was replaced with Blondy Wallace for the rest of the series. For the tournament, <b>Warner</b> <b>and</b> the other team members earned $23 (approximately $816 in 2016), although the expected share was $300 (approximately $8,000 in 2016) per player; it was a financial failure.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Australia's Network Ten {{produced}} a television mini-series titled Bodyline, dramatising {{the events of}} the 1932–33 English tour of Australia. It starred Gary Sweet as Don Bradman, Hugo Weaving as Douglas Jardine, Jim Holt as Harold Larwood, Rhys McConnochie as Pelham <b>Warner,</b> <b>and</b> Frank Thring as Jardine's mentor Lord Harris. The series took some liberties with historical accuracy for the sake of drama, including a depiction of angry Australian fans burning a British flag at the Sydney Cricket Ground, an event which was never documented. Larwood, having emigrated to Australia in 1950, received several threatening and obscene phone calls after the series aired. The series was widely and strongly attacked by the surviving players for its inaccuracy and sensationalism.|$|E

5|$|Jeff Reed {{concluded}} the first drive of Super Bowl XLIII with a field goal—giving the Steelers a 3–0 lead over the Arizona Cardinals.

As he did in the first quarter, Reed scored the sole points of the third quarter giving the Steelers a 20–7 lead entering the final quarter.|$|E
5|$|On Allen's {{return to}} Bennington, the {{settlers}} {{met at the}} Catamount Tavern to discuss their options. These discussions resulted {{in the formation of}} the Green Mountain Boys in 1770, with local militia companies in each of the surrounding towns. Allen was named their Colonel Commandant, and cousins Seth <b>Warner</b> <b>and</b> Remember Baker were captains of two of the companies. Further meetings resulted in the creation of committees of safety, and laid down rules by which to resist attempts by the New York provincial government to establish its authority. These included denying surveyors sent by the province the ability to survey any land in the Grants, not just land owned through the Wentworth grants.|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{became the}} head of Project Alberta, with Ramsey as his {{scientific}} and technical deputy, and Ashworth as his operations officer and military alternate.

5|$|The {{observatory}} {{was originally}} built by Worchester R. <b>Warner</b> <b>and</b> Ambrose Swasey, owners of Warner & Swasey Company, which made precision instruments and telescopes {{in the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries. They became trustees of the Case School of Applied Science (later renamed to Case Institute of Technology), and built an observatory in East Cleveland, which they gave to the school in 1919. This original observatory building was located on Taylor Road four {{miles east of the}} university campus and housed a 9.5-inch refractor, and was dedicated in 1920. The building was designed by the firm of Walker and Weeks. In subsequent years the observatory grew to house several more telescopes and instruments, such as the 24-inch Burrell Schmidt telescope, as well as an astronomical library and public lecture hall.|$|E
