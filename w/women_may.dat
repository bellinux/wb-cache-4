5|$|An {{important}} festival {{for the new}} brides is Mangala Gaur.

5|$|In {{a country}} in which few <b>women</b> <b>may</b> take out loans from large {{commercial}} banks, Grameen has focused on women borrowers; 97% of its members are women. While a World Bank study has concluded that women's access to microcredit empowers them through greater access to resources and control over decision making, some other economists argue that the relationship between microcredit and women-empowerment is less straightforward.|$|E
5|$|In the Latin Church, Catholic men {{may serve}} as deacons or priests by {{receiving}} sacramental ordination. Men and <b>women</b> <b>may</b> serve as extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion, as readers (lectors); or as altar servers. Historically, boys and men have only been permitted to serve as altar servers; however, since the 1990s, girls and women have also been permitted.|$|E
5|$|Pregnant and {{breastfeeding}} women, {{who require}} 66% more daily iodine requirement than non-pregnant <b>women,</b> <b>may</b> still not be getting enough iodine.

5|$|<b>Women</b> <b>may</b> have acute {{low back}} pain from medical {{conditions}} affecting the female reproductive system, including endometriosis, ovarian cysts, ovarian cancer, or uterine fibroids. Nearly half of all pregnant women report pain in the lower back or sacral area during pregnancy, due to changes in their posture and center of gravity causing muscle and ligament strain.|$|E
5|$|According to Simon Goldhill, the {{evidence}} is fundamentally inconclusive.

David Kawalko Roselli writes that although Goldhill's perspective is valuable, he does not sufficiently consider the theatre's ritual purpose. If women did attend the theatre, they may have sat separately from the men.|$|E

5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning in pregnant <b>women</b> <b>may</b> {{cause severe}} adverse fetal effects. Poisoning causes fetal tissue hypoxia by decreasing {{the release of}} maternal oxygen to the fetus. Carbon monoxide also crosses the placenta and combines with fetal hemoglobin, causing more direct fetal tissue hypoxia. Additionally, fetal hemoglobin has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe poisoning in the fetus than in the adult. Elimination of carbon monoxide is slower in the fetus, leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical. The level of fetal morbidity and mortality in acute carbon monoxide poisoning is significant, so despite mild maternal poisoning or following maternal recovery, severe fetal poisoning or death may still occur.|$|E
5|$|During press {{conferences}} on 13 and 14 December, DCS Gull revealed that police believed the locations where the five {{bodies were found}} to have been 'deposition sites', not murder scenes, indicating that the victims were all killed elsewhere and transported to the locations where they were later found; no comment was made on where the <b>women</b> <b>may</b> have been murdered. DCS Gull also revealed that some items of women's clothing and accessories, including a handbag and jacket, had been recovered and were being forensically tested to establish whether they belonged to any of the murdered women.|$|E
5|$|Violence against <b>women</b> <b>may</b> {{take many}} forms, {{including}} physical, sexual, emotional and psychological and may occur throughout the life-course. Structural violence may be embedded in legislation or policy, or be systematic misogyny by organisations against groups of women. Perpetrators of personal violence include state actors, strangers, acquaintances, relatives and intimate partners and manifests itself across a spectrum from discrimination, through harassment, sexual assault and rape, and physical harm to murder (femicide). It may also include cultural {{practices such as}} female genital cutting.|$|E

25|$|In one variant, the <b>woman</b> <b>may</b> {{lift and}} {{slightly}} bend her legs, resting her {{feet flat on}} the mattress. This shortens the distance between the vagina and cervix, and may apply more friction to the area termed the G-Spot. The <b>woman</b> <b>may</b> find this more comfortable than the standard position, and it can allow her to push against the man's thrust, giving her some control over the rhythm.|$|R
5|$|Breastfeeding causes {{negative}} feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Depending {{on the strength}} of the {{negative feedback}}, breastfeeding <b>women</b> <b>may</b> experience complete suppression of follicular development, but no ovulation, or normal menstrual cycle may resume. Suppression of ovulation is more likely when suckling occurs more frequently. The production of prolactin in response to suckling is important to maintaining lactational amenorrhea. On average, women who are fully breastfeeding whose infants suckle frequently experience a return of menstruation at fourteen and a half months postpartum. There is a wide range of response among individual breastfeeding women, however, with some experiencing return of menstruation at two months and others remaining amenorrheic for up to 42 months postpartum.|$|E
5|$|Smoking {{and the use}} of {{progestin}} {{are both}} protective against endometrial cancer. Smoking provides protection by altering the metabolism of estrogen and promoting weight loss and early menopause. This protective effect lasts long after smoking is stopped. Progestin is present in the combined oral contraceptive pill and the hormonal intrauterine device (IUD). Combined oral contraceptives reduce risk more the longer they are taken: by 56% after four years, 67% after eight years, and 72% after twelve years. This risk reduction continues for at least fifteen years after contraceptive use has been stopped. Obese <b>women</b> <b>may</b> need higher doses of progestin to be protected. Having had more than fiveinfants (grand multiparity) is also a protective factor, and having at least one child reduces the risk by 35%. Breastfeeding for more than 18months reduces risk by 23%. Increased physical activity reduces an individual's risk by 38–46%. There is preliminary evidence that consumption of soy is protective.|$|E
5|$|The {{years after}} the Black Death left many women widows; in the wider economy labour was in short supply and land was {{suddenly}} readily available. In rural areas peasant women could enjoy a better standard of living than ever before, but {{the amount of work}} being done by <b>women</b> <b>may</b> have increased. Many other women travelled to the towns and cities, {{to the point where they}} outnumbered men in some settlements. There they worked with their husbands, or in a limited number of occupations, including spinning, making clothes, victualling and as servants. Some women became full-time ale brewers, until they were pushed out of business by the male-dominated beer industry in the 15th century. Higher status jobs and apprenticeships, however, remained closed to women. As in earlier times, noblewomen exercised power on their estates in their husbands' absence and again, if necessary, defended them in sieges and skirmishes. Wealthy widows who could successfully claim their rightful share of their late husband's property could live as powerful members of the community in their own right.|$|E

5|$|Wear of the {{insignia}} is {{according to}} guidelines {{issued by the}} Chancellery of Honours, which stipulate that the badges be worn before most other national orders—that is, {{at the end of}} an individual's medal bar closest to the centre of the chest or at the wearer's neck—with only the Victoria Cross, the Cross of Valour, and the badge of the Order of Merit permitted to be worn before the badges of the Order of Canada. Those in the grades of Companion or Officer may wear their badges on a neck ribbon, while those in the Member group display their insignia suspended by a ribbon from a medal bar on the left chest. Protocol originally followed the British tradition, wherein female appointees wore their Order of Canada emblem on a ribbon bow positioned on the left shoulder. These regulations were altered in 1997, and <b>women</b> <b>may</b> wear their insignia in either the traditional manner or in the same fashion as the men.|$|E
5|$|Women {{had limited}} access to formal {{education}} and girls benefited less than boys from {{the expansion of the}} parish school system. Some women were taught reading, domestic tasks, but often not writing. In noble households some received a private education and some female literary figures emerged from the seventeenth century. Religion may have been particularly important as a means of expression for women and from the seventeenth century <b>women</b> <b>may</b> have had greater opportunities for religious participation in movements outside of the established kirk. Women had very little legal status {{at the beginning of the}} period, unable to act as witnesses or legally responsible for their own actions. From the mid-sixteenth century they were increasingly criminalised, with statutes allowing them to be prosecuted for infanticide and as witches. Seventy-five per cent of an estimated 6,000 individuals prosecuted for witchcraft between 1563 and 1736 were women and perhaps 1,500 were executed. As a result, some historians have seen this period as characterised by increasing concern with women and attempts to control and constrain them.|$|E
