5|$|At {{the dawn}} of the 19th century, less than a handful of academically trained architects were active in Norway, most of them {{military}} officers having studied civil engineering. The market for architects was limited in a sparsely inhabited country with no capital city, no court and no important government institutions. Architecture was of interest mainly to a limited group of wealthy merchants and landowners. However, toward the close of the previous century, this group saw a remarkable increase in prosperity. Large fortunes were made by a few, who then sought to surround themselves with buildings and gardens appropriate to their social position. Well connected internationally, these people were acquainted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> trends in architecture. Neoclassical structures were much in demand.|$|E

5|$|Interceptor {{aircraft}} with ever-improving performance {{remained the}} only effective anti-bomber weapons {{by the early}} 1950s, and even these were having problems keeping up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> designs; Soviet interceptors during the late 1950s could not intercept the high-altitude U-2 reconnaissance aircraft, {{in spite of its}} relatively low speeds. It was later discovered that flying faster also made radar detection much more difficult due to an effect known as the blip-to-scan ratio, and any reduction in tracking efficiency would further interfere with the operation and guidance of fighters.|$|E
