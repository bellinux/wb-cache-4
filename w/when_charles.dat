5|$|Prussia became anxious at Austrian {{advances}} on the Rhine frontier, and Frederick again invaded Bohemia, {{beginning a}} Second Silesian War; Prussian troops sacked Prague in August 1744. The French plans fell apart <b>when</b> <b>Charles</b> Albert died in January 1745. The French overran the Austrian Netherlands in May.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>Charles</b> {{reveals that}} he was {{involved}} in the plot to assassinate Palmer, she is deeply shocked and says that she can never forgive him. Contemplating suicide, Logan comes into her room, begging for forgiveness. Rather than accepting his apology, Martha tells him that she is horrified to be his wife.|$|E
5|$|A second {{expedition}} {{was mounted}} shortly thereafter, and Throsby's nephew Charles Throsby Smith, Wild and Vaughan further explored the Molonglo (Ngambri) and Queanbeyan (Jullergung) Rivers, {{becoming the first}} Europeans to camp at the site. However, they failed to find the Murrumbidgee, and Smith declared that the river did not exist. The issue of the Murrumbidgee was solved in 1821, <b>when</b> <b>Charles</b> Throsby mounted a third expedition and successfully reached the watercourse, on the way providing the first detailed account of the land where Canberra now resides.|$|E

5|$|After the war many castles were slighted, damaged to {{put them}} beyond {{military}} use, but Parliament {{was concerned about the}} threat of a royalist invasion from Scotland and Beaumaris was spared. Colonel John Jones became the castle governor and a garrison was installed inside, at a cost of £1,703 a year. <b>When</b> <b>Charles</b> II returned to the throne in 1660 and restored the Bulkeley family as castle constables, Beaumaris appears to have been stripped of its valuable lead and remaining resources, including the roofs.|$|E
5|$|Mary did {{not enjoy}} her {{retirement}} for long; Eleanor died in her arms in February 1558. The grief-stricken queen travelled to Charles to ask him for advice about her future. Charles {{told her that he}} wanted her to resume regency in the Netherlands, and promised a home and a large income, but Mary declined the offer. Her nephew Philip then urged her advisor to convince her to return. <b>When</b> <b>Charles</b> became ill in August, Mary accepted the offer and decided that she would become governor once again.|$|E
5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) {{wants to}} throw a party to {{celebrate}} his fifteenth anniversary working at Dunder Mifflin. He becomes unnerved <b>when</b> <b>Charles</b> Miner (Idris Elba), the new company vice president, exhibits a no-nonsense attitude towards him, making Michael not feel like his own boss. Charles seems to establish {{a good relationship with}} the rest of the staff; he buys everyone lunch and reveals the truth about their 401(k) plans and the possibility of layoffs, which Michael withheld so as not to worry the staff. Taking advice from Chief Financial Officer David Wallace (Andy Buckley), Michael tries to become better acquainted with Charles, but is unsuccessful. Michael attempts to contact Wallace on the phone, one attempt leading to getting transferred to Charles. <b>When</b> <b>Charles</b> catches the Party Planning Committee planning Michael's party during office hours, he dissolves the committee and cancels Michael's party. Michael decides to drive to New York to talk to Wallace.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the town}} was {{destroyed}} by fire in 1577. After this time the town was largely rebuilt including Waterloo House and Manor Court House in Fore Street which were built as a house and courtroom, and have now been converted into shops and offices. Further damage to the town {{took place during the}} English Civil War with both sides plundering its resources, particularly in 1644 <b>when</b> <b>Charles</b> I spent a week in the town.|$|E
5|$|The statues were {{eventually}} taken down <b>when</b> <b>Charles</b> II {{came to the}} throne and were either repaired or replaced. A bronze statue of James II by Grinling Gibbons, depicting the king wearing the robes of a Roman emperor, stood just outside the garden in the Pebble Court from 1686 to 1898 (with a short interruption during the Glorious Revolution). It now occupies a spot in Trafalgar Square outside the National Gallery.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>Charles</b> X Gustav {{left the}} Commonwealth and headed westwards for an anti-Danish counterstrike, the Swedish–Brandenburgian–Transylvanian {{alliance}} broke apart.

5|$|By 1604, <b>when</b> <b>Charles</b> {{was three}} and a half, {{he was able to}} walk the length of the great hall at Dunfermline Palace without assistance, and it was decided that he was strong enough to make the journey to England to be reunited with his family. In mid-July 1604, Charles left Dunfermline for England where he was to spend {{most of the rest of}} his life. In England, Charles was placed under the charge of Elizabeth, Lady Carey, the wife of courtier Sir Robert Carey, who put him in boots made of Spanish leather and brass to help {{strengthen}} his weak ankles. His speech development was also slow, and he retained a stammer, or hesitant speech, for the rest of his life.|$|E
5|$|Criticism over artistic {{matters in}} The Pall Mall Gazette {{provoked}} {{a letter in}} self-defence, and soon Wilde was a contributor to that and other journals during 1885–87. He enjoyed reviewing and journalism; the form suited his style. He could organise and share his views on art, literature and life, yet in a format less tedious than lecturing. Buoyed up, his reviews were largely chatty and positive. Wilde, like his parents before him, also supported the cause of Irish Nationalism. <b>When</b> <b>Charles</b> Stewart Parnell was falsely accused of inciting murder Wilde wrote a series of astute columns defending him in the Daily Chronicle.|$|E
5|$|During the 1640s, <b>when</b> <b>Charles</b> {{was still}} young, his father fought Parliamentary and Puritan {{forces in the}} English Civil War. Charles {{accompanied}} his father during the Battle of Edgehill and, {{at the age of}} fourteen, participated in the campaigns of 1645, when he was made titular commander of the English forces in the West Country. By spring 1646, his father was losing the war, and Charles left England due to fears for his safety. Setting off from Falmouth after staying at Pendennis Castle, he went first to the Isles of Scilly, then to Jersey, and finally to France, where his mother was already living in exile and his first cousin, eight-year-old Louis XIV, was king. Charles I surrendered into captivity in May 1646.|$|E

5|$|During the Interregnum, Portland Castle {{continued}} to be garrisoned and used a prison, with a unit of 103 men attached to it in 1651. It was used to defend the Portland Roads during the First Anglo-Dutch War of 1653, seeing action in a three-day long naval battle between English and Dutch forces. <b>When</b> <b>Charles</b> II returned to the throne in 1660, he reduced the garrison to its pre-war levels but repaired the fortifications {{in the light of}} the continuing Dutch threat; in 1676 the castle was equipped with 16 guns.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth's {{plan to have}} Mary {{married to}} Louis of France divided the court. The Lackfis, {{the master of the}} {{treasury}} Nicholas Zámbó and the judge royal Nicholas Szécsi openly opposed it and renounced their allegiance to the queen dowager in August, which resulted in her depriving them of all their offices and replacing them with Garai's partisans. The kingdom {{was on the verge of}} a civil war <b>when</b> <b>Charles</b> decided to invade, encouraged by John Horvat and his brother Paul, Bishop of Zagreb. Charles' imminent arrival forced Elizabeth to yield and abandon the idea of French marriage. While her envoys in Paris were preparing for Louis's journey, Elizabeth came to terms with her opponents and designated Szécsi as the new palatine.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 15th century on the Shetlanders sold their goods through the Hanseatic League of German merchantmen. The Hansa would buy {{shiploads}} of salted fish, wool and butter, and import salt, cloth, beer and other goods. The late 16th century and early 17th century {{were dominated by}} {{the influence of the}} despotic Robert Stewart, Earl of Orkney, who was granted the islands by his half-sister Mary Queen of Scots, and his son Patrick. The latter commenced the building of Scalloway Castle, but after his imprisonment in 1609 the Crown annexed Orkney and Shetland again until 1643 <b>when</b> <b>Charles</b> I granted them to William Douglas, 7th Earl of Morton. These rights were held on and off by the Mortons until 1766, when they were sold by James Douglas, 14th Earl of Morton to Laurence Dundas.|$|E

5|$|Huntington's disease, {{particularly}} {{the application of}} the genetic test for the disease, has raised several ethical issues. The issues for genetic testing include defining how mature an individual should be before being considered eligible for testing, ensuring the confidentiality of results, and whether companies should be allowed to use test results for decisions on employment, life insurance or other financial matters. There was controversy <b>when</b> <b>Charles</b> Davenport proposed in 1910 that compulsory sterilization and immigration control be used for people with certain diseases, including HD, as part of the eugenics movement. In vitro fertilization has some issues regarding its use of embryos. Some HD research has ethical issues due to its use of animal testing and embryonic stem cells.|$|E
5|$|In 1649, Parliament ordered new {{supplies}} of ammunition and powder {{be sent to}} Walmer and the other castles of the Downs, which were brought back into good order. The garrison at Walmer remained substantial during the period, with a governor, a corporal and 20 soldiers, but <b>when</b> <b>Charles</b> II was restored to the throne in 1660 he reduced the numbers again to a captain, lieutenant, porter and 16 men. In the Glorious Revolution of 1688 against Charles' brother, King James II, the townsfolk of Deal seized Walmer Castle on behalf of William III, the Prince of Orange. By {{the end of the}} century, however, the castle was increasingly regarded as out of date from a military perspective.|$|E
5|$|In 1649, Parliament {{ordered that}} {{supplies}} of ammunition and powder {{be sent to}} Sandown and the other castles of the Downs.
