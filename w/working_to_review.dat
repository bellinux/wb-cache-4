The day-to-day function of our Association {{is in the hands of}} our Executive Director, Dr. Russell Rayman, and the team in the Home Office, but the strategic thinking and tactical guidance comes from the members of Council who work so hard on your behalf. It is a continuously evolving process as we react to events in the aerospace medical world, while at the same time maintaining a balanced view to avoid hasty 'shooting from the hip. ' We also have to ensure that best business and finan-cial practice is adhered to in the corporate gover-nance and management of the Association. For ex-ample, you may recall that the decision was taken last year to pay off half of the outstanding mort-gage on the headquarters building; we are now examining the impact this had on the Associ-ation's finances and reviewing the next step.

One of these areas is epidemiology of periodontal diseases. Methods Two theses "A systematic review of definitions of periodontitis and the methods that have been used to identify periodontitis" 1 and "Factors affecting community oral health care needs and provision" 2 formed the starting point for this {{position paper}}. Additional relevant and more recent publications were retrieved through a MEDLINE search. Results The literature reveals a distinct lack of consensus and uniformity in the definition of periodontitis within epidemiological studies. There are also numerous differences in the methods used. The consequence is that data from studies using differing case definitions and differing survey methods are not easily interpretable or comparable. The limitations of the widely used Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Need (CPITN) and its more recent derivatives are widely recognized. Against this background, this position paper reviews the current evidence base, outlines existing problems and suggests how epidemiology of periodontal diseases may be improved. Conclusions The remit of this <b>working</b> group was <b>to</b> <b>review</b> and discuss the existing evidence base of epidemiology of periodontal diseases and to identify future areas of work to further enhance it. </p...|$|R
