5|$|John and Prudentia Hogg <b>were</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> {{hear that}} the Shelleys had left England, hoping that their son would become more {{conservative}} in Percy's absence. They were disappointed with his continued rejection of their Tory political views, but he did attend church with them during his visits and {{was no longer a}} vegetarian. They were also somewhat concerned about Hogg's association with the radical publisher Leigh Hunt and his circle of friends. Through Hunt, Hogg became acquainted with several members of London's literary circles, including Thomas Love Peacock, Charles Lamb and Walter Coulson. Hogg also met John Keats, who gave him a copy of his first book of poetry.|$|E
5|$|The Wrights <b>were</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> be {{free from}} the {{distraction}} of reporters. The absence of newsmen also reduced the chance of competitors learning their methods. After the Kitty Hawk powered flights, the Wrights {{made a decision to}} begin withdrawing from the bicycle business so they could concentrate on creating and marketing a practical airplane. This was financially risky, since they were neither wealthy nor government-funded (unlike other experimenters such as Ader, Maxim, Langley and Alberto Santos-Dumont). The Wright brothers did not have the luxury of being able to give away their invention; it was to be their livelihood. Thus, their secrecy intensified, encouraged by advice from their patent attorney, Henry Toulmin, not to reveal details of their machine.|$|E
5|$|The {{results were}} applauded by the Senate at first, who <b>were</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> {{be rid of}} the former emperor. But {{tradition}} held that the emperor could only be selected from among the Senate; moreover, Macrinus {{was a member of}} the equestrian class, the lower of the two aristocratic classes. These disadvantages led the Senate to severely scrutinize his every action. Their opposition, however, was not backed by any actual power. The military at the time was concentrated against the Parthians in the area around Edessa (modern Şanlıurfa, Turkey), so there was no force anywhere in the Empire that could contest the status of Macrinus.|$|E

5|$|Just over a {{month after}} playing for Wales against New Zealand, John faced the {{tourists}} again, this time {{as part of an}} East Wales team, made up of players from Cardiff, London Welsh and Bridgend. The New Zealand 'All Blacks' were under pressure throughout the match, with John kicking from deep and away from the opposing forwards, allowing his team to make rushes on the 'All Black' defence. After 22minutes East Wales took the lead when a missed drop goal attempt from John was collected by Cardiff wing Frank Wilson for a try. A defensive lapse from the East Wales team allowed an equalising try, but with the score at 3–3, East Wales dominated the last ten minutes of the match. With the last kick of the match, John had space for one final dropped goal, but his kick sailed inches outside the post. The New Zealanders <b>were</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> escape with the draw and finished the tour without losing a single match. Three days after turning out for East Wales, John and Edwards were paired to face the same New Zealand team, this time played at Twickenham for invitational touring side the Barbarians. The half time result of 3–3 flattered the Barbarians, who were out-played in the forward positions, but the team took the lead early in the second half when a perfect diagonal kick to the corner by John resulted in a try by England's Bob Lloyd. The Barbarians defended strongly for twenty minutes, but lost to two very late tries.|$|E
25|$|On the {{initiative}} of Their Royal Highnesses Crown Prince Alexander II and Crown Princess Katherine, an important charity event in aid of victims of the tragic Greek fires, occurred on 24 September 2007 at the Ekali Club in Athens, {{in cooperation with the}} Hellenic Basketball Club Association (ESAKE), Lifeline Hellas and with the support of Vlade Divac, distinguished NBA player. The charity was honored with the presence of famous basketball players who <b>were</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> support this humanitarian event. Among many the event was attended by: Vlade Divac, Predrag Danilovic, Zarkο Paspalj, Dusan Ivkovic, Wayne Cooper, Scott Pollard, Grant Napiere, Chris Webber, Glen Rice.|$|E
25|$|Nelson {{worked to}} {{strengthen}} his candidacy for governor, though historians suggest that his ultimate goal was the U.S. Senate. He arranged {{to be drafted}} as a candidate rather than actively pursuing office. Appointed officeholders fearing the loss of patronage to Alliance political victories <b>were</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> support him. Appealing to the Republican need for unity at the convention, he maneuvered to gain the support of rivals such as Davis and Washburn, or at least avoid their opposition. He was unanimously nominated by 709 delegates as the Republican candidate for governor on July 28, 1892 in the St. Paul People's Church. His acceptance speech was a libertarian broadside against both Democrats and Populists; it emboldened the delegates for the election campaign.|$|E

25|$|In another way, too, Stokes {{did much}} for the {{progress}} of mathematical physics. Soon after {{he was elected to}} the Lucasian chair he announced that he regarded it as part of his professional duties to help any member of the university in difficulties he might encounter in his mathematical studies, and the assistance rendered was so real that pupils <b>were</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> consult him, even after they had become colleagues, on mathematical and physical problems in which they found themselves at a loss. Then during the thirty years he acted as secretary of the Royal Society he exercised an enormous if inconspicuous influence on the advancement of mathematical and physical science, not only directly by his own investigations, but indirectly by suggesting problems for inquiry and inciting men to attack them, and by his readiness to give encouragement and help.|$|E
25|$|A {{new wave}} of discontent spread amongst the {{different}} Xhosa tribes on the colonial frontier, {{and there was another}} uprising in Basutoland under Moirosi after the Gaika-Galeka War. The Xhosa under Moirosi were put down with severe fighting by a colonial force, but their defeat notwithstanding, the Basutos remained restless and aggressive for several years. In 1880, the British colonial authorities attempted to extend the Peace Preservation Act of 1878 to Basutoland, attempting a general disarmament of the Basutos. Further fighting followed the proclamation, which did not have a conclusive end, although peace was declared in December 1882. The imperial government took over Basutoland as a crown colony, on the understanding that Cape Colony should contribute £18,000 annually for administrative purposes. The authorities of the Colony <b>were</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> be relieved in 1884 of the administration of the Transkei, whose administration had already cost them more than £3,000,000.|$|E
25|$|When {{the railway}} {{merged with the}} Caledonian Railway on 9 July 1847, Greenock Cathcart was the main access to the coast. However, in 1869 their {{dominance}} of this traffic ended when the Glasgow and South Western Railway opened its station on the waterfront at Princes Pier, Greenock. Greenock's growth had led to increasing overcrowding of tenement houses, and passengers <b>were</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> avoid the walk through these streets. Attempts by the Caledonian to extend their railway to Gourock had met with difficulties in getting through a built up area, but now, spurred by competition, they gained Parliamentary approval in 1884. The route took the railway in a tunnel from the station under the town's Well Park (which provides a level area atop a high rocky crag), then in further cuttings and tunnels westwards through the hillside clear of the expensive properties on the coast. After three years in construction the Gourock Extension Railway opened on 1 June 1889.|$|E

25|$|By 1249, the Spanish Reconquista had {{concluded}} its main phase. During the murderous scenes which were enacted in 1391 in Spanish-controlled Seville, and were repeated {{in a large}} part of Spain and then across the sea in Majorca, the Sephardi Jews of Spain <b>were</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> seize the first opportunity to emigrate to North Africa in order to escape the persecution. A hundred years later, Ferdinand and Isabella decreed the Edict of the Expulsion of the Jews. The Jews were then driven from Spain in 1492 and Portugal in 1496. Their sudden inroad upon Morocco and the whole of North Africa was then repeated on a very much larger scale. A group of natives of Fez fled to Spain {{in the course of the}} fifteenth century and returned to Fez after 1492, served as a unique bridge between the natives and those who arrived from Spain ("Sephardim"). The most outstanding representative of this group was the Ibn Danan family. The family was among the intellectual and financial elite of Fez for centuries for example, they maintained their own synagogue in Fez.|$|E
25|$|On {{the left}} wing, {{in spite of}} the Royalist counter-strokes, the attack had the best of it, {{capturing}} field after field, and thus gradually gaining ground to the front. Here, Viscount Falkland was killed. On the Reading road itself Essex did not succeed in deploying on to the open ground on Newbury Wash, but victoriously repelled the royal horse when it charged up to the lanes and hedges held by his foot. On the extreme right of the Parliamentary army, which stood in the open ground of Enborne Heath, took place a famous incident. Here, two of the London regiments, fresh to war as they were, were exposed to a trial as severe as that which broke down the veteran Spanish infantry at Rocroi in this same year. Rupert and the Royalist horse, again and again, charged up to the squares of pikes. Between each charge, his guns tried to disorder the Londoners, {{but it was not until}} the advance of the royal infantry that the trained bands retired, slowly and in magnificent order, to the edge of the heath. The result was that Essex's army had fought its hardest, and failed to break the opposing line. But the Royalists had suffered so heavily, and above all, the valour displayed by the Parliamentarians had so profoundly impressed them, that they <b>were</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> give up the disputed road, and withdraw into Newbury. Essex thereupon pursued his march. Reading was reached on 22 September 1643 after a small rearguard skirmish at Aldermaston, and so ended the First Battle of Newbury, one of the most dramatic episodes of English history.|$|E
500|$|Critics disliked Dotty, {{with her}} accent being criticised by Jane Simon from The Daily Mirror. Critics from The Daily Mirror and The Guardian <b>were</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> see her leave. However, {{executive}} producer Diederick Santer praised Conlin for her portrayal of Dotty, whilst both Brown and Altman opined that the storyline {{was one of}} their highlights.

500|$|The battle had {{significant}} effects within the Scots community of North Carolina, where Loyalists refused {{to turn out}} when calls to arms were made later in the war, and many were routed {{out of their homes}} by the pillaging activities of their Patriot neighbors. [...] Flora MacDonald ended up returning to her native Skye in 1779, and when General Charles Cornwallis passed through the Cross Creek area in 1781, he reported that [...] "any of the inhabitants rode into camp, shook me by the hand, said they <b>were</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> see us and that we had beat Greene and then rode home." ...|$|E
500|$|Shelley practised {{this early}} form of feminist historiography. Biographical writing was, in her words, {{supposed}} to [...] "form {{as it were}} a school in which to study the philosophy of history" [...] and to teach [...] "lessons". These [...] "lessons" [...] consisted, most frequently and importantly, of criticisms of male-dominated institutions, such as primogeniture. She also praises societies that are progressive with regard to gender relations—she wrote, for example, [...] "No slur was cast by the [...] Italians on feminine accomplishments...Where abstruse learning was a fashion among men, they <b>were</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> find in their friends of the other sex, minds educated to share their pursuits".|$|E

500|$|Lambert had the acumen {{to refuse}} the {{management}} offers of various impresarios and agents, and by , {{he had returned}} to Leicester as a wealthy man. [...] He returned to his favourite pastimes, breeding sporting dogs and fighting cocks. A terrier bitch, {{for which he was}} offered 100guineas (about £ as of [...] ), was said to be the finest in England. He refused to sell the dog, which became his lifetime companion. He began again to attend sporting events, as a report on the Leicester Races of September 1806 noted that [...] "Among the distinguished characters upon the turf we <b>were</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> see our old friend, Mr.Daniel Lambert, in apparent high health and spirits". Although too heavy to follow hunts on horseback, he used a portion of the money earned in London to build up a pack of greyhounds, watching from his carriage as they coursed hares in the Leicestershire countryside.|$|E
500|$|As French's column {{neared the}} Modder River on 13 February, {{a force of}} about 1,000Boers made contact with his right flank. [...] French wheeled his right and center brigades towards their enemy, thereby {{allowing}} the brigade on the left to hold course for Klip Drift, while giving the enemy the false impression that he was headed for Klipkraal Drift. [...] The whole force then wheeled left {{at the last minute}} and charged the Klip Drift crossing at full gallop. The Boers at Klip Drift, who were taken completely by surprise, left their camp and provisions behind, which French's exhausted men and horses <b>were</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> seize. [...] Although speed was important, the cavalry had to wait for the infantry to catch up to secure the lines of communication before moving forward to relieve Kimberley. [...] The cavalry's route had taken them deep inside the Free State over Cronjé's line of communication, thereby cutting off any Boer forces who did not immediately fall back. Meanwhile, Roberts led the main force in an easterly direction with the objective of capturing the Boer capital of Bloemfontein.|$|E
500|$|Because of the {{low rates}} of pay, the stories {{submitted}} to Astonishing {{in its first year}} had generally already been rejected elsewhere. [...] However, Pohl {{was a member of the}} Futurians, a group of science fiction fans that included Isaac Asimov, C.M. Kornbluth, Richard Wilson and Donald Wollheim; the Futurians were eager to become professional writers and <b>were</b> <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> submit stories to Pohl. [...] Asimov recalls in his memoirs that on October 27, 1939, two days after Pohl was hired to edit the magazines, Pohl turned up at Asimov's apartment and asked to buy [...] "Half-Breed", a story Pohl had been trying to sell on Asimov's behalf since June of that year. [...] Pohl needed stories quickly for the first issue of Astonishing (though the name had not yet been selected), and as the story had been rejected by Amazing Stories and Astounding Stories, Asimov was willing to sell it for half a cent per word. [...] A couple of weeks later Pohl also acquired [...] "The Callistan Menace" [...] from Asimov. [...] The other Futurians were prolific as well; in Pohl's first year as an editor he bought a total of fifteen stories from them for the two magazines. [...] Damon Knight, another of the Futurians, recalled in his memoirs that Pohl once asked the group for a story to fill out an issue, with $35 available to pay for it. [...] Kornbluth and Wilson wrote a first draft, alternating turns at the typewriter; the result was edited by Harry Dockweiler, another Futurian, and then again by Pohl before it appeared in the April 1940 Astonishing under the title [...] "Stepsons of Mars", with a byline of [...] "Ivar Towers". [...] Pohl contributed material himself, using the pseudonyms [...] "James McCreigh" [...] and [...] "Dirk Wylie" [...] (the latter pseudonym was also used by Dockweiler); he used his own stories when he needed to fill an issue, and to supplement his salary of ten dollars a week. [...] Particularly after his marriage to Doris Baumgardt in August 1940, Pohl realized that his salary covered their apartment rent with almost no money left over, and began to augment his income by selling to himself as well as to other magazines. [...] When Pohl lost his job as editor in late 1941, he had bought from himself (and paid for) a couple of stories that he had not actually written, and hence had to write them very quickly and turn them in.|$|E
