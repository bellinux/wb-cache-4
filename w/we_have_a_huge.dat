2500|$|Most {{of these}} {{practices}} {{were accompanied by}} a loud utterance of ritual texts, which had their own semantics, symbolism and structure. Standing {{in the yard and}} facing the cloud, farmers would address the cloud himself, or hail, prodigy, the unholy power, ala, drowned or hanged persons (usually calling by name someone like that from their region), and others. People tried to deflect the horrific bringer of clouds from their fields, by scaring him off with something even more appalling that was allegedly present in their village. For example: [...] "Back!

We only have ashes to put their eyes out!" [...] Uttering this, they would spill the ashes of the fire on which a česnica had been baked for Christmas, into the wind. (Sava and Nevena were a couple who drowned themselves in the Morava River for not having been allowed to marry.)

60|$|That {{contrast}} is the measure, not only between two nations, but between two modes of historical construction and development. For {{there is not}} really very much difference, as European history goes, {{in the time that}} has elapsed between us and the Jacobite and between us and the Jacobin. When George III was crowned the gauntlet of the King's Champion was picked up by a partisan of the Stuarts. When George III was still on the throne the Bourbons were driven out of France as the Stuarts had been driven out of England. Yet the French are just sufficiently aware that the Bourbons might possibly return that they will take a little trouble to discourage it; whereas we are so certain that the Stuarts will never return that we actually play their most passionate tunes as a compliment to their rivals. And we do not even do it tauntingly. I examined the faces of all the bandsmen; and I am sure they were devoid of irony: indeed, it is difficult to blow a wind instrument ironically. We do it quite unconsciously; because <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> fundamental dogma, which the French have not. We really believe that the past is past.

Monte solved this issue by designing a desalination system. He also built a windmill for electricity, and aviaries for Judy's pet birds. Judy remembered her pet birds and their aviaries on the island:“All of a sudden my birds had eggs! And all of a sudden, the eggs hatched! So he decided to build me some aviaries and that was the birth of Birds Galore and I’ve had that business since 1980. That’s how I started breeding birds!” ...|$|R
30|$|One of the {{problems}} that prevent us from accurately classifying a Big Data is the noise found within it. Feature selection, including the removal of noisy features and elimination of ineffective vocabulary, makes training and applying a classier more effective [67]. The existing approaches to finding an adequate subset of features fall into two groups: feature filters and feature wrappers [68]. In feature filters, the final set of features is selected based on the statistical properties of those features. With feature wrappers, an iterative search process is applied through a modeling tool’s results. In each iteration, a candidate set of features is used in the modeling tool and the results are recorded. Each step uses the results from the previous step, and so new tentative sets are generated. This process is repeated until some specified convergence criteria are met. In our experiment, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> number of features and instances, and thus, our data was very sparse. We tried several feature selection methods to see how they would affect the accuracy of our sentiment analysis.|$|R

Campbell formed a band, but soon afterwards he was attacked by racist thugs at a London underground station; Hughes was later imprisoned for shooting one of the assailants. Campbell first came to public attention by performing with his band at the VE Day celebrations in Trafalgar Square and Piccadilly Circus in 1945. He said:"People didn't know what was going on but they joined in. I suppose it was curiosity.

5000|$|Design of Experiments(DoE) {{is used by}} {{engineers}} or applied {{scientist in}} physical or simulated experiments {{to reduce the number}} of runs. Each experiment is defined by a number of factors, for instance the oven temperature or the heating time. One run is defined by specific values of each factor. Hence, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> number of runs which increase exponentially with the number of factors. The main question in DoE is to figure out a reliable small subset of runs to answer initially defined questions. These questions vary from the significance of a factor to predictions of unobserved areas in the experiment. Cornerstone focuses on D-optimal designs [...] to select the subset of runs. They can be adjusted flexibly to practical requirements like constraints in the design space, integration of existing experiments, and model approaches in any order. The analysis of DoEs use regression methods for both categorical and continuous factors (incl. compositions).
