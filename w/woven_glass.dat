As such, when formulating constitutive models, consideration of the shear – tension coupling can result in improved accuracy in subsequent predictions of the forming process.

40|$|Modelling {{the forming}} process for {{engineering}} fabrics and textile composites using a mechanical approach, {{such as the}} finite element method, requires characterisation of the material’s behaviour under large shear deformation. For woven engineering fabrics, a coupling between in-plane tension and both shear compliance and the onset of wrinkling is to be expected. This paper focuses on a novel testing technique, the biaxial bias extension test, {{as a means to}} investigate this shear–tension coupling and fabric wrinkling. Novel methods of determining the wrinkling behaviour are demonstrated. The main difficulty with the technique lies in extracting the material contribution to the recorded signal. To do this, an experimental method is proposed and demonstrated using a plain <b>weave</b> <b>glass</b> fabric. Biaxial bias extension test results are compared against picture frame and uniaxial bias extension results...|$|R

50|$|The {{first major}} {{development}} of the matte shot was the early 1900s by Norman Dawn ASC. Dawn had seamlessly <b>woven</b> <b>glass</b> shots into many of his films: such as the crumbling California Missions in the movie Missions of California, and used the glass shot to revolutionize the in-camera matte. Now, instead of taking their live action footage to a real location, filmmakers would shoot the live action as before with the cut-out cards in place, then rewind the film and transfer it to a camera designed to minimize vibrations. Then the filmmakers would shoot a glass shot instead of a live action background. The resulting composite was of fairly high quality, since the matte line - the place of transition from the live action to the painted background - was much less jumpy. In addition, the new in-camera matte was much more cost effective, as the glass didn’t {{have to be ready}} the day the live action was shot. One downside to this method was that since the film was exposed twice, there was always the risk of accidentally overexposing the film and ruining the footage filmed earlier.|$|E

To provide epoxy based {{composites}} with self-healing ability, two-component healing system {{consisting of}} urea-formaldehyde walled microcapsules containing epoxy (30 ~ 70 µm in diameter) and CuBr 2 (2 -MeIm) 4 (the complex of CuBr 2 and 2 -methylimidazole) latent hardener was synthesized. When cracks were initiated or propagated in the composites, the neighbor micro-encapsulated epoxy would be damaged and released. As the latent hardener is soluble in epoxy, {{it can be}} well dispersed in epoxy composites during composites manufacturing, and hence activate the released epoxy wherever it is. As a result, repair of the cracked sites is completed through curing of the released epoxy. The present work indicated that the plain <b>weave</b> <b>glass</b> fabric laminates using the above self-healing epoxy as the matrix have been provided with self-healing capability...|$|R
