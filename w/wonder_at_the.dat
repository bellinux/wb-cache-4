5|$|Beebe {{described}} his religious beliefs {{as a combination}} of Presbyterianism and Buddhism. His religion was largely the result of seeking to combine his sense of awe and <b>wonder</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> natural world with a scientific understanding of its workings. He was highly critical of efforts to use science to justify political ideologies, such as socialism or the belief that women were inferior to men. Beebe also disapproved of the eugenic ideas advocated by many biologists in the early 20th century, including some of his contemporaries at the zoo, although this was largely {{out of fear that}} these ideas would alienate friends of the zoo and cause divisions among its staff.|$|E
5|$|Another tradition, {{related by}} R.C. MacLeod, told of certain events {{which took place}} after an heir to the clan's chiefship was born. The story related how at this time, there was much rejoicing at Dunvegan Castle, and since the infant's nursemaid was anxious {{to join in the}} festivities in the hall below, she left the infant alone in her room. When the baby awoke, crying of cold, no human help could hear him in his secluded room; however, a host of fairies {{appeared}} and wrapped the infant in the Fairy Flag. Meanwhile, the clansmen banqueting below demanded to see the child and the maid was ordered to bring him forth. When she brought out the baby, wrapped in the flag, everyone gazed in <b>wonder</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> child and the garb wrapped around him. The room was filled with the fairies' song which declared that the flag had the power to save the clan three times. When the song ended, and silence fell across the crowded room, the flag was taken from the infant and locked in a chest where it has ever since been preserved.|$|E

60|$|THERE {{was once}} a child, and he strolled about a good deal, and thought {{of a number of}} things. He had a sister, who was a child too, and his {{constant}} companion. These two used to wonder all day long. They <b>wondered</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beauty of <b>the</b> flowers; they <b>wondered</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> height and blueness of <b>the</b> sky; they <b>wondered</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> depth of the bright water; they <b>wondered</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> goodness and the power of GOD who made the lovely world.|$|R

This handsome collie dog {{was something of a}} social wolf, half showing his fangs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moment. But with genuine kindheartedness for another wolf. Aaron was touched.|$|R

25|$|As MacKenzie's layout {{was seen}} by more and more people, a {{collective}} shudder ran through the office (but) MacKenzie's dominance was so total there was nobody left in the organisation who could rein him in except Murdoch. (Everyone in the office) seemed paralysed—"looking like rabbits in the headlights"—as one hack described them. The error staring them in the face was too glaring. It obviously wasn't a silly mistake; nor was it a simple oversight. Nobody really had any comment on it—they just took one look and went away shaking their heads in <b>wonder</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> enormity of it. It was a 'classic smear'.|$|E

60|$|The ignorant in {{all ages}} have <b>wondered</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> exception; the wise, in {{proportion}} {{as they have}} become wise, have <b>wondered</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rule. Pestilences, prodigies, portents, the results of seeming accidents, excite the vulgar mind. Only the abnormal or casual is worthy of their attention. The man of science finds a deeper and more awful charm in contemplating the results of law; in watching, not what seem to be occasional failures in nature: but what is a perpetual and calm success.|$|R
25|$|McGann's Doctor was a {{combination}} of boyish glee and <b>wonder</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> universe with occasional flashes of an old soul in a young body, and was well received by fans, even if the reactions to the television movie were mixed. However, in spite of the success and popularity of the film in the UK, the disappointing US viewing figures led Fox to decline to commission a series. With no broadcast network attached in the United States, Universal could not produce a series for the BBC alone. Indeed, it would have been cheaper for the BBC to make a new series themselves rather than pay for a series with no production partner. Thus plans for a new series were scrapped, with no new production looking likely as the decade came to an end.|$|E
25|$|Townspeople sing joyfully of {{the peace}} that will follow the {{imminent}} wedding of the prince of Mantua and the princess of Bavaria. Young people look forward to songs and dancing, {{and a group of}} prisoners released by the King celebrate. A group of impoverished students, Spark, Hartmann, Facio enter hoping also to share in some fun while contemptuous of the townspeople. The King and his guards emerge from the palace. The King announces the arrival of the prince of Mantua to wed his daughter Elsbeth and encourages the celebration. A courtier explains that Elsbeth is grieving on the death of the court jester of whom she was fond. Marinoni, the prince of Mantua's aide-de-camp enquires about the festivities and the princess, but is mocked by the students. Fantasio enters and sings a ballad to the moon. The page of Elsbeth enters to tell the students to keep their voices down as they will disturb the princess; they enter the tavern. Elsbeth sings of her <b>wonder</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> change in her life, but Fantasio enters unseen and asks her if she is really in love – with a complete stranger. Elsbeth, startled, leaves repeating Fantasio's words. When Spark joins his friend Fantasio talks extravagantly of his feelings. Soon the funeral cortege of court jester St Jean passes by and Fantasio has the idea to take the appearance of the jester {{to gain access to the}} princess, and he and Spark enter the nearby tailor's shop to get the costume. This will also help him avoid being arrested for his debts by the police. The fatuous prince of Mantua and his aide Marinoni enter, and the prince, wanting to discover the real thoughts and feelings of his future wife determines to dress as a servant to find out; he and Marinoni exit to exchange their clothes. The students come in singing and Fantasio re-appears dressed as the old jester. Two sentries mistakenly let him into the palace grounds and he looks forward to his adventure and to meeting Elsbeth again.|$|E

500|$|The obituarist for The Times {{highlighted}} Horne's [...] "remarkably skilful {{but very}} personal comic technique" [...] of playing [...] "a friendly good-natured old buffer who was simply doing his best, apparently lost in <b>wonder,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> glossier, more spectacular talents of those among whom he found himself". The media analysts Frank Krutnik and Steve Neale see a similar role, and consider that [...] "Horne functioned, like [...] Benny, [...] Allen and [...] Handley before him, as a 'stooge' {{rather than a}} joke-wielder, frequently switching roles between announcer and in-sketch performer".|$|E
500|$|... "The Beast Below" [...] was in {{the second}} {{production}} block of the series. The read-through for the episode took place 20 August 2009. Scenes set in Liz 10's Buckingham Palace were filmed at Margam Country Park, Port Talbot on a night shoot on 22 September 2009. The interior of the orangery {{was used as the}} Palace. The room in the Tower of London where the climax takes place was filmed at Neath Abbey. The industrial streets of Starship UK were filmed in a disused factory in Mamhilad, with the art department designing it in accordance to Moffat's specific description in the script. Gillan put in some of her own <b>wonder</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> set into Amy's actions when she admires the street for the first time.|$|E
500|$|In 1921, {{after years}} of {{pleading}} for proper schooling, Nancy was allowed a year's boarding at Hatherop Castle, an informal private establishment for young ladies of good family. Laura Thompson, in her biography of Nancy, describes Hatherop as not so much [...] a school, [...] "more a chaste foretaste of debutante life". Here Nancy learned French and other subjects, played organised games and joined a Girl Guide troop. It was her first extended experience of life away from home, and she enjoyed it. The following year she was allowed to accompany four other girls on a cultural trip to Paris, Florence and Venice; her letters home are full of expressions of <b>wonder</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sights and treasures: [...] "I had no idea I was so fond of pictures... if only I had a room of my own I {{would make it a}} regular picture gallery".|$|E

[...] Mei Li jumps to conclusions and leaves horrified. [...] Ta leaves the lonely Helen, totally oblivious to her attempts to interest him. [...] Wang wants the bar and its [...] "evil spirits" [...] shut down; his sister-in-law informs him that free enterprise cannot be shut down, and the two <b>wonder</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> foibles {{of the younger generation}} ("The Other Generation"). [...] Ta arrives home to admit that his father was right, Mei Li is the girl for him. [...] But now, Mei Li wants nothing to do with him, and the Lis leave the Wang home. [...] Sammy Fong and Linda decide to get married ("Sunday"), but when he goes to the Three Family Association (a benevolent association) to announce Linda as his bride, he finds Mei Li and her father there, and the elders insist that he honor his betrothal to the immigrant girl.|$|E
500|$|Negative reviews {{focused on}} the lack of {{character}} depth or atmosphere. Jaime N. Christley, writing in Slant Magazine, commented, [...] "It goes in for the idea of texture, tics, and human behavior, but there's no conviction, and no real push for eccentricity. ... It hardly seems interested in its characters or in any depiction of their work, settling instead for types of characters and kinds of scenes, correctly placed among the pendulum swings of Watney's dramatic journey." [...] In The Village Voice, Stephanie Zacharek stated that the actors [...] "are treated as accessories", and that the director is [...] "workmanlike in his approach to science, which always trumps magic in The Martian — that's the point. But if we can't feel a sense of <b>wonder</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> magnitude and mystery of space, why even bother?" [...] In Cinemixtape, J. Olson commented: [...] "Ridley Scott and company have concocted the most colossally mediocre sci-fi movie of the decade, all in pursuit of empty backslapping and a grade school level celebration of science. Not only is The Martian not in the same class as Scott’s two masterpieces – Alien and Blade Runner – it’s not even on the same continent." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Schuur {{appeared}} as a guest performer on Sesame Street. In an interview by Elmo, she answered questions about how a blind person can learn to use other senses to get along in the world. In 1998, she was a special guest on [...] "Ray Charles in Concert", {{a benefit for the}} Miami Lighthouse for the Blind. [...] She performed at Carnegie Hall in a tribute to Irving Berlin in 1988, and again in 1996 in a tribute to Ella Fitzgerald. Schuur gave a performance in 1999 to honor Stevie <b>Wonder</b> <b>at</b> <b>The</b> Kennedy Center Honors. She sang [...] "I Just Called to Say I Love You" [...] arranged and accompanied by Herbie Hancock. Entertainment writer Jake Elyachar rated this {{as one of the top}} 20 best performances ever given on the Kennedy Honors series. Wonder was visibly emotionally moved by the performance. She was awarded the Helen Keller Achievement Award by the American Foundation for the Blind in 2000. Late in 2003, Schuur released Midnight, featuring original songs written by Barry Manilow for the album. Manilow's long-time songwriting team, which included co-producer Eddie Arkin, and lyricists Marty Panzer, Bruce Susan, and Adrienne Anderson, contributed to the project. Manilow produced the album and also performed on it. The guest artists were Brian McKnight and Karrin Allyson and it was backed by Tony-winner Bill Elliott and the Bill Elliott Swing Orchestra. Her second live album, Diane Schuur: Live In London, was recorded at Ronnie Scott's, a historic jazz club in London's Soho District. Scott's is the site of previous live albums by Ella Fitzgerald and Nina Simone.|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert {{awarded the}} film {{three and a}} half out of four stars, praising its focus on [...] "characters, relationships, fear and mostly unseen menace" [...] rather than its visual effects, as well as the acting. He also commended Edwards for [...] "evoking ... awe and beauty" [...] and for the {{creature}} designs. Peter Bradshaw, writing for The Guardian, gave it four stars out of five, described the film as a [...] "terrifically exciting sci-fi movie" [...] and concluded that Edwards [...] "channels the upriver nightmares of [...] Herzog and [...] Coppola, with a strong streak of Spielbergian <b>wonder</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sight of two aliens apparently dancing". Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune was critical of the performances but praised the film's [...] "considerable, crafty virtues", its premise, and its ending. Jeanette Catsoulis of The New York Times called the film [...] "wondrously atmospheric" [...] and [...] "effortlessly compel", and praised Edwards' [...] "beautiful, otherworldly" [...] visual effects. Dan Jolin of Empire echoed the comparison to Herzog, opining that the film [...] "exhibits the lyrical surrealism of [...] jungle excursions". He also praised the visual effects, Edwards' cinematography, and the [...] "simmering" [...] chemistry between McNairy and Able, concluding that the film was [...] "both shoestring and sci-fi filmmaking at its best". Michael Rechtshaffen of the Associated Press praised Edwards for [...] "add original touches to the genre" [...] and for his production design. He criticised the [...] "tentative" [...] and [...] "alienating" [...] performances of McNairy and Able, but stated that [...] "the overall picture still impresses". Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail disagreed, comparing the lead actors' chemistry to Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in [...] Before Sunrise and praising the pacing. Clark Collis of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B+, also praising the performances of McNairy and Able and commending Edwards' work.|$|E
