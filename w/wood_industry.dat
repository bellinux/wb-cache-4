Forest-owners {{were forced to}} sell large portions of their lumber to industries in Eastern Norway. The long distances and hence transport costs cut into the prices, giving the forest-owners reduced revenue. At the time the forest industry was until 1957 organized through a price regulation mechanism, with maximum prices for lumber set by the government. Prices were set through negotiations between forest owner associations, organized by drainage system, and the industry.|$|E

In December, he began working as an adviser for the Romanian Ministry of Agriculture and Royal Domains, under Dimitrie A. Grecianu. He continued to serve as head of the liquidation committee until 1922. During the same time, he also became involved with the Bukovina <b>wood</b> <b>industry,</b> a founder (in late 1920) and Chairman of the eponymous S.A. corporation Industria Silvică din Bucovina. By 1923, he was resuming his collaboration with Maniu, hoping to draw him and the PNR into an alliance with Flondor. Their politics was aimed against the centralizing National Liberal Party and its Bukovinan allies, the Democratic Unionists.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, the {{government}} nationalised the forests which were earlier with the zamindars. India also nationalised {{most of the}} forest <b>wood</b> <b>industry</b> and non-wood forest products industry. Over the years, many rules and regulations were introduced by India. In 1980, the Conservation Act was passed, which stipulated that the central permission is required to practice sustainable agro-forestry in a forest area. Violations or lack of permits was made a criminal offense. These nationalisation wave and laws intended to limit deforestation, conserve biodiversity, and save wildlife. However, the intent of these regulations was not matched by reality that followed. Neither investment aimed at sustainable forestry nor knowledge transfer followed once India had nationalised and heavily regulated forestry. Deforestation increased, biodiversity diminished and wildlife dwindled. India's rural population and impoverished families continued to ignore the laws passed in Delhi, and use the forests near them for sustenance.|$|E

25|$|The federal {{division}} of the Federated Saw Mill, Timber Yard and General Wood Workers Employees' Association {{changed its name to}} the Amalgamated Timber Workers' Union of Australia. The former union had been registered federally in 1907 and had registered branches in Victoria, Adelaide, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania. Although the organization was deregistered in 1918 its members formed a new union, the Australian Timber Workers' Union, the same year. The new union extended coverage to workers in box and case factories, saw makers' shops, joiners' workshops, carpenters, implement workers and wood-working machinists. In 1940 the union filed an application and succeeded in extending its coverage to most workers employed in the timber and <b>wood</b> <b>industry</b> including cabinet makers and furniture factories. In 1991 it amalgamated with the Pulp & Paper Workers' Federation of Australia to form the Australian Timber & Allied Industries Union. Later in the year amalgamation with the Building Workers' Industrial Union of Australia created the ATAIU & BWIU Amalgamated Union. Further amalgamations eventually saw this organization become part of the Construction Forestry Mining & Energy Union in 1993.|$|E
2500|$|The aims {{at a new}} {{understanding}} of regionalism yet in a modern idiom materialised in the greater use of timber - the building material most associated historically with Finnish architecture. However, there lies a dichotomy in its use: between its inherent positive values and its use as symbolising nostalgia, not to mention exploiting its industrial potential by the pervading timber industry. Already in 1956 Alvar Aalto argued that the use of wood was not a nostalgic return to a traditional material; {{it was a case of}} its [...] "biological characteristics, its limited heat conductivity, its kinship with man and living nature, the pleasant sensation to the touch that it gives.". A special unit, the so-called Wood Studio - partly funded by the Finnish <b>wood</b> <b>industry</b> - was founded at Aalto University not only to research wood construction but also to build experimental structures in wood, often using computer-based parametric design principles. An early example of this is the Observation Tower at Helsinki Zoo (2002) by Ville Hara and the Wood Studio. Similarly, Kärsämäki Shingle Church (1999-2004) by Anssi Lassila, was the result of a student competition held by the University of Oulu Department of Architecture, based on the idea of a modern church built using 18th century timber construction techniques, as a reminder of a previous church on the same site. Other notable large-scale wooden constructions since 2000 include the Sibelius Concert Hall, Lahti (1997-2000), by APRT; the east stand roof of the Helsinki Olympic Stadium (2005) by K2S Architects; and Kilden Performing Arts Centre, Kristiansand, Norway (2012), by ALA Architects. The Museum of the History of Polish Jews, Warsaw, Poland (2013), by Lahdelma & Mahlamäki is characterised by the principle of [...] "complex objects in a glass box", including parametrically-designed organic forms.|$|E

40|$|The <b>wood</b> {{products}} <b>industry</b> {{is important}} to Sweden's prosperity, and is currently facing several challenges by increased global competition. To avoid the gradual decline of the industry’s contribution to the country’s revenues and employment opportunities, the Swedish <b>wood</b> products <b>industry</b> needs to increase {{the proportion of the}} raw material that is refined. New and efficient manufacturing technologies are essential to support this development. The implementation of automation in manufacturing needs to be supported by conscious and well-defined strategies. However, currently, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge regarding automation decisions in this industry. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis is to increase knowledge regarding which aspects should be taken into account when automation decisions are considered in the <b>wood</b> products <b>industry.</b> Three research questions are addressed: (1) What is the current state of manufacturing operations in the <b>wood</b> products <b>industry?</b> (2) What are the potential opportunities for automation in the <b>wood</b> products <b>industry?</b> And (3) What challenges can arise from automation in the <b>wood</b> products <b>industry?</b> The results presented in this thesis are based on four research papers. The first paper provides an overview of the current state of manufacturing operations in the <b>wood</b> products <b>industry.</b> The second paper examined the impact of the raw material on manufacturing operations in the <b>wood</b> products <b>industry.</b> The third paper assessed how the levels of automation in manufacturing impact operational performance. The fourth paper examined automation opportunities and challenges to gain a better understanding of the reasoning behind automation decisions in the industry. In general, it is concluded that automation decisions in the <b>wood</b> products <b>industry</b> tend to be based on “gut feeling” and previous experience with automation rather than well-defined decisions and strategies. This is due to inadequate knowledge and familiarity with automation technologies in manufacturing. Furthermore, the findings showed that different aspects of manufacturing interact and impact each other. For this reason, it is essential to take into account other aspects of manufacturing when considering automation decisions. ProWOO...|$|R

Heaps of wood residues are common features in <b>wood</b> <b>industries</b> throughout the year. In Nigeria, this residue is generally regarded as waste and {{this has led to}} open burning practices, dumping in water bodies or dumping in an open area which constitutes environmental pollution. Sawmills in Nigeria generated over 1, 000, 000 m 3 of wood waste in 2010 while about 5000 m 3 of waste was generated in plywood mills. Nigeria generates about 1. 8 million tons of sawdust annually and 5. 2 million tons of wood wastes. The impact of improper disposal of waste wood on the environment affects both the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Also burning of waste wood releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere causing various health issues. Reuse/recycling of these wood residues in Nigeria will reduce the pressure on our ever decreasing forests, reduce environmental pollution, create wealth and employment.
