40|$|Male {{homosexual}} preference (MHP) {{has long}} been of interest to scholars studying the evolution of human sexuality. Indeed, MHP is partially heritable, induces a reproductive cost and is common. MHP has thus been considered a Darwinian paradox. Several questions arise when MHP is considered in an evolutionary context. At <b>what</b> <b>point</b> <b>did</b> MHP appear in the human evolutionary history? Is MHP present in all human groups? How has MHP evolved, given that MHP is a reproductively costly trait? These questions were addressed here, {{using data from the}} anthropological and archaeological literature. Our detailed analysis of the available data challenges the common view of MHP being a "virtually universal" trait present in humans since prehistory. The conditions under which it is possible to affirm that MHP was present in past societies are discussed. Furthermore, using anthropological reports, {{the presence or absence of}} MHP was documented for 107 societies, allowing us to conclude that evidence of the absence of MHP is available for some societies. A recent evolutionary hypothesis has argued that social stratification together with hypergyny (the hypergyny hypothesis) are necessary conditions for the evolution of MHP. Here, the link between the level of stratification and the probability of observing MHP was tested using an unprecedented large dataset. Furthermore, the test was performed for the first time by controlling for the phylogenetic non-independence between societies. A positive relationship was observed between the level of social stratification and the probability of observing MHP, supporting the hypergyny hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|At <b>what</b> <b>point</b> <b>did</b> {{machines}} and technology {{begin to have}} an impact on the cultural consciousness and imagination of Europe? How was this reflected through the art and literature of the time? Was technology a sign of the fall of humanity from its original state of innocence or a sign of human progress and mastery over the natural world? In his characteristically lucid and captivating style, Jonathan Sawday investigates these questions and more by engaging with the poetry, philosophy, art, and engineering of the period to find the lost world of the machine in the pre-industrial culture of the European Renaissance. The aesthetic and intellectual dimension of these machines appealed to familiar figures such as Shakespeare, Francis Bacon, Montaigne, and Leonardo da Vinci as well as to a host of lesser known writers and artists in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. This intellectual engagement with machines in the European Renaissance gave rise to new attitudes towards gender, work and labour, and even fostered the new sciences of artificial life and reason which would be pursued by figures such as Descartes, Hobbes, and Leibniz in the seventeenth century. Writers, philosophers and artists had mixed and often conflicting reactions to technology, reflecting a paradoxical attitude between modern progress and traditional values. Underpinning the enthusiastic creation of a machine-driven world, then, were stories of loss and catastrophe. These contradictory attitudes are part of the legacy of the European Renaissance, just as much as the plays of Shakespeare or the poetry of John Milton. And this historical legacy helps to explain many of our own attitudes towards the technology that surrounds us, sustains us, and sometimes perplexes us in the modern world...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} {{everyday}} interactions {{between parents and}} elementary school teachers in interwar London. By the interwar period, half a century after the introduction of compulsory elementary education in England and Wales, the principle of schooling was widely accepted and there was little parental hostility to issues of curriculum or teaching. Instead, controversies centred over how far {{the responsibilities of the}} state extended into children’s wider upbringing. At <b>what</b> <b>point</b> <b>did</b> parenting end and the responsibility of the teacher begin? How far beyond the school gates did the influence of the parents stretch and vice versa? This chapter argues that the nature of the communities from which children came had a major influence on the parent-teacher relationship. The most constructive relationships developed when teachers understood and allowed for the home-lives of children and parents. This prompts a consideration {{of the nature of the}} ‘local’ state: in one sense, teachers acted as intermediaries in the implementation of state aims, but the way in which these were delivered varied according to the individual demands and priorities of each school. Parents themselves occupied a distinct place within the power hierarchy, and did have a limited influence over the conduct of teachers. What parents often objected to was not the legitimacy of rules per se, but the exercise of arbitrary power, reflecting a nuanced interpretation of what was acceptable, within the fairly broad parameters of the time. Much, of course, came down to the individual relationships between teachers and parents, which could vary widely. But rather than a constant state of mutual enmity or hostility these relationships were dynamic and fluid: they changed over time and depending on the issue at stake, they could improve as well as decline, and they could be constructive as much as confrontational...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{scholarship}} {{on the history}} of anti-Semitism in Europe has made much of an intriguing and puzzling charge by some early modern Christians that Jewish men menstruated. This particular anti-Semitic libel seems to have been widespread throughout early modern Western Europe, not only within clerical circles, but within secular and popular society as well. Evolving from roots at least as far back as late antiquity, it arrived in its “mature” form in select thirteenth century texts, in which Jewish men suffered monthly flows of blood from the posterior region, either anally or from the penis. This is a difficult topic for the modern mind to study because contemporary conceptions of embodiment and gender are radically different from medieval thought on the subject. However, it is the very difficulty of understanding how identity constructs change over time that makes male menstruation libel such a fascinating and relevant topic for discussion. What are the ancient and medieval roots of the myth of Jewish male menstruation? At <b>what</b> <b>point</b> <b>did</b> these representations become sexed/gendered? What ideological purposes might this gendering have served and what can we moderns learn from the history of Jewish male menstruation libel about what it means for gender to be “modern” in the first place? A critical examination of the theological and medico-scientific origins of the menstruation libel reveals that its production was a contingent historical process that required many permutations and contributions to crystallize. Nevertheless, as early as the thirteenth century, versions of this narrative clearly feminized Jewish men. These representations became more widespread in early modern Europe and constitute an essential shift toward more modern notions of sex, gender, and embodiment that naturalized the role of Jewish men in European society, physically marking them with a badge of difference...|$|E

Evidence is gathered on the government’s liabilities and assets to estimate its net worth and so answer these questions. I. Liabilities Figure 1 shows the government’s debt position from 1784 to 1802. During the revolution the government issued two types of liabilities, interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing debt. Official statistics exist only for the government’s interest-bearing debt after 1791. The rest of the data in Figure 1 was estimated (Grubb, 2005). By 1780 a total of 200 million dollars in non-interest-bearing debt—Continental dollars (paper money) —had been issued, none after 1779, and by 1782 a total of 39 million dollars of interest-bearing debt, mostly at 6 percent annual interest, had been issued. These debts are assumed to be the government’s only liabilities. Pre- 1789 {{the federal government}} (Congress) did not have the constitutional power to directly tax the public. Instead, Congress requested monies from state governments 1 who in turn taxed their citizens to raise the monies requested. Congress asked the states to accept its Continental dollars for payment of state taxes which could then be used to meet the states ’ money obligations to Congress. Continental dollars so paid into the U. S. Treasury were burnt. Desperate for specie, Congress also allowed the states after 1781 to meet their money obligations to Congress by paying one dollar in specie in place of 40 Continental dollars—temporarily defaulting on the face value of its non-interest-bearing debt. Through the above payment/retirement mechanism the outstanding face value of the non-interest-bearing debt fell from 200 million dollars in 1780 to 81 million by 179...|$|E

Buscou-se responder, neste estudo, à seguinte questão: de que forma a educação profissional contribui para a formação {{integral}} dos jovens egressos de cursos técnicos, para facultar a sua inserção no mundo do trabalho, contemplando tanto o desenvolvimento de competências técnicas, como a construção de identidade individual, com base em valores pessoais? A análise desta questão constituiu o objetivo geral desta investigação, cujos objetivos específicos se detiveram em: identificar os fatores históricos relacionados com a trajetória da educação profissional no Brasil; compreender a importância dos valores pessoais e da ética, no processo de formação profissional; analisar a relação da formação técnica, sob a perspectiva de formação de valores pessoais, morais e éticos, com as demandas do mundo do trabalho. Inicialmente, abordam-se informações acerca da trajetória histórica da educação profissional no Brasil, desde o período Colonial até os dias atuais. Em seguida, referenciam-se informações pertinentes ao papel da educação, como promotora de valores pessoais, morais e éticos, imprescindíveis ao processo de formação do ser humano, compreendidos como elementos de extrema importância no processo de integração de alunos, egressos de curso técnico, no mundo do trabalho. Logo após, tratam-se dos procedimentos e métodos que subsidiaram o estudo proposto e, por fim, procede-se a uma análise acerca da formação técnica obtida por meio da educação profissional, aliada à formação de valores pessoais, morais e éticos, buscando-se compreender até que ponto esta formação se deu de fato e, em que sentido, impactou a vida dos jovens na busca por oportunidades de emprego e, consequentemente, por melhores condições de vida. Dessa forma, pretende-se contribuir, com este estudo, para uma melhor compreensão e reflexão acerca dos objetivos da educação profissional, percebidos sob a perspectiva de formação integral do ser humano, seja como detentor de conhecimentos e habilidades técnicas adequadas, seja como indivíduo dotado de valores pessoais e éticos estruturantes da identidade individual. Professional {{education in}} Brazil {{has been marked}} throughout its historical trajectory by the stigma of exclusion and of social segregation, the end goal of which was summed up as only formation for manual labor. Currently, given the new demands of the work world, professional education has increasingly taken on a role of relevant importance, as it proposes, within {{the formation of the}} young people, to transmit not only technical knowledge, but, above all, to form the human being with a base in personal values, ethics and morals, as a way of guaranteeing the integral formation of the human being, from the perspective of constructing a more just, equalitarian society whose principles of fraternity, justice, loyalty and love toward the neighbor are determinant in the relations between human beings and of these with God. In this perspective, this paper is an analysis of the process of integration of outgoing students of the technical programs into the work world, {{from the perspective of the}} formation of personal values constructed through the formation obtained in the Instituto Federal de Educação, Ciência e Tecnologia do Ceará [Federal Institution of Education, Science and Technology of Ceará]- campus of Cedro. This analysis constitutes the general goal of this investigation the specific goals of which are: identify the historical factors related to professional education in Brazil; comprehend the importance of personal values and of ethics in the process of professional formation; analyze the relation of the technical formation, from the perspective of the formation of personal values, morals and ethics, to the demands of the work world. In the first chapter information about the historical trajectory of professional education in Brazil is presented, beginning with the Colonial period to the current days. In the second chapter, information is referenced which is pertinent to the role of education as promoter of personal values, morals and ethics which are indispensable for the process of formation of the human being and are understood as elements of extreme importance in the process of integration of outgoing students from the technical program into the work world. In the third chapter, we deal with the procedures and methods which provided support for the proposed study, and, finally, in the fourth chapter, we proceed with an analysis about the technical formation obtained through professional education allied to the formation of personal values, morals and ethics, seeking to understand up to <b>what</b> <b>point</b> <b>did</b> this formation actually take place and in what way did it impact the life of the young people seeking opportunities for work and consequently better living conditions.
