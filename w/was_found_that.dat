5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study examined the}} effects on the Antarctic scallop {{of an increase in}} lead, copper and mercury content in the water. It <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> a rise in levels of heavy metals led to quite severe morphological changes in the scallop and a reduction in lysosomal membrane stability. Another experiment involved transplanting scallops from a clean water area to a bay where effluent from an Antarctic base was released. It <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the scallops were relatively unaffected by the outflows and this resulted in the belief that benthic marine communities were unlikely to be severely affected by such discharges.|$|E

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} explain the {{leverage}} effect in UK stock returns by reference to the return volatility, leverage and size characteristics of UK companies. A leverage effect <b>is</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> stronger for smaller companies and has greater explanatory power over the returns of smaller companies. The properties of a theoretical model that predicts that companies with higher leverage ratios will experience greater leverage effects are explored. On examining leverage ratio data, it <b>is</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> there <b>is</b> a propensity for smaller companies to have higher leverage ratios. The transmission of volatility shocks between the companies is also examined and it <b>is</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the volatility of larger firm returns is important in determining both the volatility and returns of smaller firms, but not the reverse. Moreover, it <b>is</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> where volatility spillovers are important, they improve out-of-sample volatility forecasts. ...|$|R

5|$|A fold of semi-wild Highland cattle was studied, over {{a period}} of 4 years. It <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the cattle have a clear {{structure}} and hierarchy of dominance, which reduced aggression. Social standing depended on age and sex, with older cattle being dominant to calves and younger ones and males dominant to females. Young bulls would dominate adult cows when they reached around 2 years of age. Calves from the top ranking cow were given higher social status, despite minimal intervention from their mother. Playfighting, licking and mounting were seen as friendly contact.|$|E
5|$|A {{separate}} 2008 {{study from}} Western Michigan University found that hybrids and conventional vehicles are equally safe when travelling {{more than about}} , because tire and wind noise generate most of the audible cues at those speeds. Hybrid cars were also tested safe when leaving a stoplight and it <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> under this condition they do not pose a risk to pedestrians. All Prius models {{used in the study}} engaged their internal combustion engines when accelerating from a standstill and produced enough noise to be detected.|$|E

The poster of that video, known as AETBX, has suggested to inquiring journalists that GadgetZZ is {{not telling the truth}} about how it came to possess the video. Internet investigators managed to establish that it was filmed in the former Zofiówka Sanatorium outside Otwock, Poland, sometime between November 2013 and the video's release.|$|E
5|$|An English folk tale {{tells how}} an old woman, a {{supposed}} witch, cursed her landlord {{and all his}} possessions when he demanded the unpaid rent for her cottage. Soon afterwards, a large toad fell on his wife and caused her to collapse. The toad was thrown into the fire but escaped with severe burns. Meanwhile, the old witch's cottage had caught fire and she was badly burnt. By next day, both toad and witch had died, and it <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the woman's burns exactly mirrored those of the toad.|$|E
5|$|Andean cocks-of-the-rocks {{influence}} the environment around them. It <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> a white-capped dipper renovated an abandoned cock-of-the-rock nest to lay its eggs in. Cock-of-the-rocks also change the surrounding flora through seed dispersal. Seeds {{that the birds}} ingest often are found deposited around lek and nesting sites. This favours the germination and growth of those seeds. The diversity {{of these types of}} seeds {{has been found to be}} increased at lek and nests and decreased throughout the surrounding forest.|$|E

40|$|The atom - {{electromagnetic}} field interaction is {{studied in the}} Dicke model, wherein a single field mode is interacting {{with a collection of}} two level atoms at thermal equilibrium. It <b>is</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> in the superradiant phase of the system, wherein the Bose-Einstein condensation of photons takes place, the notion of photon as an elementary electromagnetic excitation ceases to exist. The phase and intensity excitations of the condensate <b>are</b> <b>found</b> to <b>be</b> the true excitations of {{electromagnetic field}}. It <b>is</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> in this phase, the atom interacts with these excitations in a distinct coherent transition process, apart from the known stimulated emission/absorption and spontaneous emission processes. In the coherent transition it <b>is</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> while the atomic state changes in course of the transition process, the state of electromagnetic field remains unaffected. It <b>is</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the transition probability of such coherent transition process is macroscopically large compared to other stimulated emission/absorption and spontaneous emission processes.

It <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> copper, iron, cadmium and chromium were concentrated in the digestive organ of the Antarctic scallop. Cadmium levels in particular {{were higher in the}} Antarctic scallop than in P. jacobaeus and other pectinids, but zinc and manganese, found in the kidney, were considerably lower.|$|E

Later, it <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> RR Lyrae variables are fainter than Cepheid variables, which caused Shapley to overestimate the distances of the clusters.|$|E
