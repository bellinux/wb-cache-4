40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of electronic outlining {{on the quality of}} students' writing products and how outlining affects perceived mental effort during the writing task. Additionally, it was studied how students appropriate and appreciate an outline tool and whether they need explicit instruction in order to engage in planning. To answer these questions, the writing products and self-report data from 34 tenth-grade students of a Dutch pre-university school were analysed. Students wrote two similar argumentative texts with or <b>without</b> <b>an</b> <b>outline</b> tool. Results show that electronic outlining improves the quality of students' argumentative texts and decreases mental effort. Answers to a retrospective questionnaire showed that a short instruction on the outline tool was sufficient for students to understand its working and that most students experienced the tool as beneficial. Finally, results indicate that without specific instruction on text planning, students hardly devote any time to this important aspect of writing...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Lectures or presentations are {{frequently}} used for teaching large groups. AIM: We investigated if a structured presentation with an explicit outline enables better recall {{of the content}} immediately and 2 weeks after the event, compared to a presentation without an explicit outline. METHODS: Twenty-seven medical students were randomized to receive a presentation with (experimental) and without (control) an outline. The experimental presentation initially delivered the key message with an outline made of four headline statements, followed by facts and examples and ended with repetition of the key message and headline statements. The control presentation delivered all the same facts and examples sequentially, concluding with the key message. Recall immediately and 2 weeks after the presentation was rated by two blinded assessors. RESULTS: Immediately after the presentation, the mean scores were similar {{in the two groups}} (9. 8, SD 2. 6 vs. 9. 0, SD 2. 1). After 2 weeks, the experimental group achieved a higher mean score than control (7. 0, SD 2. 1 vs. 5. 2, SD 1. 9; p= 0. 02). CONCLUSION: A presentation with a structured outline enables the audience to recall the content better than that <b>without</b> <b>an</b> <b>outline,</b> a fortnight after presentation...|$|E

40|$|Social cues {{presented}} at visual fixation {{have been shown}} to strongly influence an observer’s attention and response selection. Here we ask whether the same holds for cues (initially) presented away from fixation, more alike how cues are commonly perceived in natural vision. In six experiments, we show that extrafoveally presented cues with <b>a</b> distinct <b>outline,</b> such as pointing hands, rotated heads, and arrow cues result in strong cueing of responses (either to the cue itself, or a cued object). In contrast, cues <b>without</b> <b>a</b> clear <b>outline,</b> such as gazing eyes and direction words have a much weaker effects on participants’ responses to a target cue. We also show that distraction effects on response times are relatively weak, but that strong interference effects can be obtained by measuring mouse trajectories. Eye tracking suggests that gaze cues are slower to respond to because their direction cannot easily be perceived in extrafoveal vision. Together these data suggest that the strength of an extrafoveal cue is determined by the shape of the outline of the cue, rather than its biological relevance (i. e., whether the cue is provided by another human being), and that this shape effect is due to how easily the direction of the cue can be perceived in extrafoveal vision...|$|R
40|$|Various {{types of}} "nuages" and "lamellae anulata" {{can be found}} during Dermatobia hominis spermatogenesis. In spermatogonia, the "nuages" occur as {{granules}} juxtaposed to the cytoplasmic face of the nuclear envelope or as cytoplasmic granules similar to glycogen granules. In spermatocytes, {{in addition to the}} "nuages", dense spherical bodies of approximately 1. 0 µm in diameter are also observed. In the spermatids the "nuages" can be of the following types: perinuclear granules, spherical granules with diameters varying in length from 0. 5 to 1. 0 µm, granules similar to glycogen granules, granules with variable diameters which accumulate at the flagellum base forming the centriole adjunct, or remain in the cytoplasm. "Nuages" can also be observed in these cellular types as dense masses, <b>without</b> <b>a</b> definite <b>outline</b> and are common to animal germinal cells in general. The "lamellae anulata" on the other hand, are observed only in spermatocytes I and in early spermatids, being always immersed in electron-dense material of indefinite outline. In spermatids, the "lamellae anulata" are close to the nuclear envelope suggesting, in spite of opposing opinions, that these cells are envolved in the synthesis and transport of material from the nucleus to the cytoplasm...|$|R

40|$|The {{notion of}} design {{gradually}} diverges from its conceptualization as framed design projects {{that focus on}} the production of objects. It shifts to open-ended processes that are oriented toward the creation of services and the congregation of organizations. In the participatory design (PD) scene the emerging future-oriented design-after-design approach is understood as a process of ‘infrastructuring’. The co-design process of Recup’Kitchen is described as an example of an infrastructuring design practice within the Brussels urban living lab of the Incubators of Public Spaces research. The empirical findings of the related action-research bring up the importance of ‘wandering’ in the design process. The design journey unfolds as <b>an</b> explorative endeavor <b>without</b> <b>a</b> clearly <b>outlined</b> direction. The paper argues that this wandering contributed to a process of infrastructuring. Three factors of the wandering in the Recup’Kitchen design are discussed: multi-layered openness, future-oriented incompleteness and strategic dialogue. This framework is based on a combination of a theoretical framework and the empirical findings within the Recup’Kitchen case. Together these factors of wandering illustrate how such a design approach can benefit infrastructuring activities. Recognizing the benefits of a loss of control and an entanglement in the messiness, the article suggests implementing this spontaneous wandering practice as a design strategy. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|In 2009 Evgenij Kozlov {{defined a}} main trend in {{contemporary}} {{art in the}} 20th century which has now become universal as “Chaose art” and to which he associates part of his own work. A work is considered “Chaose art” if it is generated through assemblage and montage, <b>without</b> <b>a</b> sketch or <b>outline,</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> prior meaning; the artist creates and introduces meaning {{in the process of}} creation, whilst simultaneously searching for a new harmony. Kozlov sees this tendency best represented by Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Joan Miró, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Sigmar Polke, Neo Rauch. The term “chaose” is pronounced like “house”, as it combines “chaos” as “meaning before its emergence” with the “e” of “house” as in house music. The letter “e” therefore stands for the rhythm of this art, since [...] "Chaose Art" [...] evokes an inner movement for both the artist and the viewer. This inner movement leads to a perception of depth and freedom and ultimately on to an awareness of knowledge and confidence in chaos.|$|R
50|$|After he {{left the}} Slade, from 1903 to 1907, Orpen ran a private {{teaching}} studio, the Chelsea Art School, with his fellow Slade graduate Augustus John. Between 1902 and 1915, Orpen divided his time between London and Dublin. He taught at the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art and his teaching influenced a generation of young Irish artists. His pupils included Seán Keating, Grace Gifford, Patrick Tuohy, Leo Whelan and Margaret Clarke. This was {{the period of the}} Celtic revival in Ireland and responding to the growth of new literary and other cultural developments, Orpen painted three large allegorical paintings,Sowing New Seed, The Western Wedding and The Holy Well. A key figure in the Celtic revival was Hugh Lane, who was a friend and mentor to Orpen, and who begin collecting impressionist art works with Orpen's guidance. In the summer of 1904 Orpen and Lane visited Paris and Madrid together, and some years later Lane commissioned a series of portraits of contemporary Irish figures from Orpen for the Municipal Gallery of Modern Art in Dublin. From 1908 onwards, Orpen exhibited works in the Royal Academy on a regular basis. Between 1908 and 1912, Orpen and his family spent the summer on the coast at Howth, north of Dublin, where he began painting in the open air and developed a distinctive plein-air style that featured figures composed of touches of colour <b>without</b> <b>a</b> drawn <b>outline.</b> The most notable of these works was Midday on the Beach, shown at the NEAC in 1910.|$|R
40|$|Talent Management {{is a topic}} gaining more {{attention}} among businesses {{and it is one}} of the most important challenges faced by companies worldwide; therefore it should be a top priority for managers. Literature states that many organisations are not aware of the issue of Talent Retention and that it is the high performers who are the ones end up leaving. Due to that the generation Millennials are considered to be a generation with talent and the education needed to take over and become the next generation of leaders, it is important to take advantage of them as opportunities and factors for success. One opportunity for companies to both attract talents and thereafter retain them is through conducting trainee programmes, however, to successfully execute these programmes, resources in terms of money, time and efforts are required. Therefore, in order to achieve the best possible return on the resources invested is it crucial to be able to retain the talents after them finishing the trainee programme. In order to answer our research question and fulfil our purpose we have done a multiple case study and conducted in-depth interviews to gather qualitative data. Our sample group consisted of eight representatives, two managers and six trainees, working at the two companies sampled. Consequently, our findings show that even <b>without</b> having <b>an</b> <b>outlined</b> retention plan, companies can be successful within Talent Retention. Moreover, this research acknowledge that good leadership, presence of Psychological Ownership and opportunities for challenges and development are the most important factors leading to talents wanting to stay within the company, after participating in the company’s trainee programme...|$|R
