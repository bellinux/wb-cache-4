5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Lycoperdon perlatum grows solitarily, scattered, or {{in groups}} or clusters on the ground. It can also grow in fairy rings. Typical habitats include woods, grassy areas, and along roads. It {{has been reported}} from Pinus patula plantations in Tamil Nadu, India. The puffball sometimes confuses golfers because of its resemblance to a golf ball <b>when</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> a distance.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage for {{aircraft}} {{is complicated by}} the fact that the aircraft's background varies widely, depending on the location of the observer, the nature of the background and the aircraft's motion. For this reason, military aircraft were often painted to match the sky <b>when</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> below, and to either match the ground or break up the aircraft's outline <b>when</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> above. This is a form of countershading, likely to work best on aircraft such as heavy bombers that do not do fly inverted during combat. Because of the way light hits it, patterns of dark and light will often be present on an aircraft even if it is entirely one color, making it easier to see Reflections and specular highlights can be counteracted by painting an aircraft in neutral shades with a non-reflective, matte finish. There is a trade-off between the effectiveness of camouflage and the size of recognition markings: larger markings reduce the risk of friendly fire through misrecognition, but compromise camouflage.|$|E
5|$|The precise {{function}} of various patterns of animal coloration {{that have been}} called countershading has been debated by zoologists such as Hannah Rowland (2009), with the suggestion {{that there may be}} multiple functions including flattening and background matching <b>when</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> the side; background matching <b>when</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> above or below, implying separate colour schemes for the top and bottom surfaces; outline obliteration from above; and a variety of largely untested non-camouflage theories. A related mechanism, counter-illumination, adds the creation of light by bioluminescence or lamps to match the actual brightness of a background. Counter-illumination camouflage is common in marine organisms such as squid. It has been studied up to the prototype stage for military use in ships and aircraft, but it too has rarely or never been used in warfare.|$|E

50|$|The Dreamworld Tower {{is able to}} {{be viewed}} {{with the naked eye}} from Coochiemudlo Island in Moreton Bay, {{providing}} the atmospheric condition allows for this. The projected distance from the tower to the main beach on Coochiemudlo Island is 36 km. The closer sugar mill exhaust tower near Jacobs' Well is {{not to be confused with}} the viewing of the tower and appears to be the same height. This chimney appears to the left of the Dreamworld Tower <b>when</b> <b>viewing</b> <b>from</b> main beach.|$|R
5|$|The thorax is {{segmented}} {{into the}} two discernible parts, the pro- and pterothorax. The pterothorax is the fused meso- and metathorax, which are commonly separated in other insect species, although flexibly articulate from the prothorax. <b>When</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> below, the thorax {{is that part}} from which all three pairs of legs and both pairs of wings arise. The abdomen is everything posterior to the thorax. <b>When</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> above, most beetles appear to have three clear sections, but this is deceptive: on the beetle's upper surface, the middle section is a hard plate called the pronotum, which is only the front part of the thorax; the back part of the thorax is concealed by the beetle's wings. This further segmentation is usually best seen on the abdomen.|$|E
5|$|As of 2006, {{the star}} {{with the highest}} known {{absolute}} magnitude is LBV 1806-20, with a magnitude of −14.2. This star is at least 5,000,000 times more luminous than the Sun. The least luminous stars that are currently known {{are located in the}} NGC 6397 cluster. The faintest red dwarfs in the cluster were magnitude 26, while a 28th magnitude white dwarf was also discovered. These faint stars are so dim that their light is as bright as a birthday candle on the Moon <b>when</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Completed in 1980, {{the bank}} built the National Westminster Tower (now known as Tower 42) in London {{to serve as}} its {{international}} headquarters. At a height of 600 feet (183 m) it was the tallest building in the UK until the topping-out of Canary Wharf Tower 10 years later; its footprint loosely approximating the bank's logo <b>when</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> the air, although the architect claimed the similarity was coincidence. Also worthy of note is National Westminster House (since renamed as 103 Colmore Row) in Birmingham: the building was sold to British Land in 2007 and demolished in 2015.|$|E

5|$|Forming {{the sides}} {{of the back of the}} skull is the exoccipital, which {{surrounds}} most of the foramen magnum. The Eustachian tube extends downwards across the basoccipital and basisphenoid; these bones are thickened on either side of the tube in K. langenbergensis. K. guimarotae has a small rounded foramen beside the tube on the basoccipital, and a tuberosity bearing a ridge above. On the front of the basoccipital in both species, there are two rounded depressions near the bottom. The basisphenoid resembles a triangular hatchet in shape <b>when</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> the side.|$|E
5|$|Paint is {{the least}} {{effective}} measure, but forms a basis for other techniques. Military vehicles often become so dirty that pattern-painted camouflage is not visible, and although matt colours reduce shine, a wet vehicle can still be shiny, especially <b>when</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> above. Patterns are designed {{to make it more}} difficult to interpret shadows and shapes. The British Army adopted a disruptive scheme for vehicles operating in the stony desert of the North African Campaign and Greece, retrospectively known as the Caunter scheme. It used up to six colours applied with straight lines.|$|E
5|$|The Sun's {{color is}} white, with a CIE color-space index near (0.3, 0.3), <b>when</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> space {{or when the}} Sun is high in the sky. When {{measuring}} all the photons emitted, the Sun is actually emitting more photons in the green portion of the spectrum than any other. When the Sun is low in the sky, atmospheric scattering renders the Sun yellow, red, orange, or magenta. Despite its typical whiteness, most people mentally picture the Sun as yellow; {{the reasons for this}} are the subject of debate.|$|E
25|$|Currently, three {{variations}} of clutch installation are used. The original design used a concentric arrangement, where both clutches {{shared the same}} plane <b>when</b> <b>viewed</b> perpendicularly <b>from</b> the transmission input shaft, along the same centre line as the engine crankshaft; <b>when</b> <b>viewed</b> head-on {{along the length of}} the input shaft, this makes one clutch noticeably larger than the other.|$|R

5|$|The tear streaks are a {{means of}} visual communication. The tear streaks {{combined}} with the black lips and the contrasting white fur give the face a striking appearance and form clear expressions <b>when</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> a close range. The ears and the face are obscure from a distance, {{and so are the}} expressions. On the other hand, the tail is quite conspicuous and is probably used by mothers to direct juveniles to follow them.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes {{normally}} rotate cyclonically (<b>when</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> above, this is counterclockwise in {{the northern}} hemisphere and clockwise in the southern). While large-scale storms always rotate cyclonically due to the Coriolis effect, thunderstorms and tornadoes are so small that the direct influence of the Coriolis effect is unimportant, as indicated by their large Rossby numbers. Supercells and tornadoes rotate cyclonically in numerical simulations even when the Coriolis effect is neglected. Low-level mesocyclones and tornadoes owe their rotation to complex processes within the supercell and ambient environment.|$|E
5|$|Although in {{some areas}} the marsh shrew is {{sympatric}} {{with other members of}} the genus Sorex, no other large, velvety, gray-black shrew shares this geographic range. Its size distinguishes it from all but the American water shrew (Sorex palustris). Although the marsh shrew and the American water shrew (the two largest shrews in North America) share some features, the American water shrew has more dark-grey-to-black fur on its back, a silver-grey belly and a bi-colored tail and the marsh shrew's fringed hairs are more distinct. The American water shrew has a smaller skull, without the marsh shrew's characteristic curvature, and its upper incisors have less-distinct medial tines. The marsh shrew typically has a longer snout than that of the American water shrew, which is more streamlined <b>when</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> the side.|$|E

5|$|Ceratopsians {{are easily}} {{recognized}} by {{features of the}} skull. On {{the tip of a}} ceratopsian upper jaw is the rostral bone, an edentulous (toothless) ossification, unique to ceratopsians. Othniel Charles Marsh recognized and named this bone, which acts as a mirror image of the predentary bone on the lower jaw. This ossification evolved to morphologically aid the mastication of plant matter. Along with the predentary bone, which forms the tip of the lower jaw in all ornithischians, the rostral forms a superficially parrot-like beak. Also, the jugal bones below the eye are very tall and flare out sideways, making the skull appear somewhat triangular <b>when</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> above. This triangular appearance is accentuated in later ceratopsians by the rearwards extension of the parietal and squamosal bones of the skull roof, to form the neck frill.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter is {{the fifth}} planet from the Sun and {{the largest in the}} Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but {{two and a half times}} that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune are ice giants. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since antiquity. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. <b>When</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> Earth, Jupiter can reach an {{apparent}} magnitude of −2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{cityscape}} includes renovated and refurbished factory buildings, mid−rise housing, {{single family}} homes, and office buildings. Erie's waterfront includes the Burger King Amphitheater and surrounding parkland, which hosts numerous festivals. The Bayfront Convention Center is on Sassafras Pier next to Dobbins Landing. The Bicentennial Tower is centrally {{located in the}} skyline <b>when</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>from</b> Presque Isle State Park, with the high-rise and mid-rise buildings flanking the higher ground behind and {{to the east and}} west sides. On the east end of the waterfront, the Erie Maritime Museum and the city's main library, and third largest in Pennsylvania, host the USS Niagara. Docks and marinas fill the freshwater shoreline in between.|$|E

60|$|After {{the details}} now given, {{it may be}} {{asserted}} {{that there is not}} one point of essential difference between encircling barrier-reefs and atolls: the latter enclose a simple sheet of water, the former encircle an expanse with one or more islands rising from it. I was much struck with this fact, <b>when</b> <b>viewing,</b> <b>from</b> the heights of Tahiti, the distant island of Eimeo standing within smooth water, and encircled by a ring of snow-white breakers. Remove the central land, and an annular reef like that of an atoll in an early stage of its formation is left; remove it from Bolabola, and there remains a circle of linear coral-islets, crowned with tall cocoa-nut trees, like one of the many atolls scattered over the Pacific and Indian Oceans.|$|R
