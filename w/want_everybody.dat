In {{an interview with}} Format Magazine he said, [...] "I started making beats because I didn’t <b>want</b> <b>everybody</b> else’s sound. We wanted our own sound. So, I {{had no choice but}} to make my own beats to get that sound."

In the first read through, he said [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>everybody</b> here {{to know that you}} {{represent}} our first choice— each actor here represents our first choice for these characters. So do not fuck this up." [...] Spacey, whose last regular television role was in the series Wiseguy, responded positively to the script. He then played Richard III, which Fincher said was [...] "great training". Spacey supported the decision to release all of the episodes at once, believing that this type of release pattern will be increasingly common with television shows. He said, [...] "When I ask my friends what they did with their weekend, they say, 'Oh, I stayed in and watched three seasons of Breaking Bad or it's two seasons of Game of Thrones". He was officially cast on March 18, 2011. Robin Wright was approached by Fincher to star in the series when they worked together in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. She was cast as Claire Underwood in June 2011. Kate Mara was cast as Zoe Barnes in early February 2012. Mara's sister, Rooney Mara, worked with Fincher in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and when Kate Mara read the part of Zoe, she [...] "fell in love with the character" [...] and asked her sister to [...] "put in a word for me with Fincher". The next month, she got a call for an audition.|$|E

This is an action-adventure, science-fiction story. Period. The movie {{has nothing to do}} with Scientology." [...] Krane stated that the film had been financed [...] "without a dollar coming from the Scientologists." [...] Some people in Hollywood feared that Travolta was using his box office draw to promote Scientology teachings, and one film {{producer}} stated, [...] "This film could encourage kids to embrace the whole strange world of Scientology." [...] Travolta stated, [...] "I'm doing it because it's a great piece of science fiction. This is not about Hubbard. I'm very interested in Scientology, but that's personal. This is different." [...] In a separate interview Travolta commented on the perceived similarities between Battlefield Earth and Scientology: [...] "Well, they are kind of synonymous… L. Ron Hubbard is very famous for Scientology and Dianetics. On the other hand, he's equally as famous in the science fiction world. So for people to think that… look, I don't <b>want</b> <b>everybody</b> to try Scientology. I don't really care if somebody thinks that. I'm not worried about it. You can't be. The truth of why I'm doing it is because it's a great piece of science fiction. I'm going to be the wickedest 9-foot alien you've ever seen in your life." ...|$|E

I fortunately had the opportunity to work with her on her last day, which was my first day."

2500|$|Their {{second album}} {{entitled}} The Truth {{was released on}} May 13, 2008. In a promotional interview, member Fallon said of the album, [...] "The biggest difference {{to me is the}} fact that you grow artistically whenever you're being creative and we've been creative {{for the past couple of}} years. Our artistry has grown. When we wrote The Truth, we named the album The Truth because basically every song on the album is from personal experiences and we wanted to get personal with our fans. We <b>want</b> <b>everybody</b> to know that they're not alone going through these things and we're here." [...] The album was released in the UK on May 12, while the Japanese release is on May 14 and featured two bonus tracks, [...] "Do It to It" [...] (Rap Remix) and [...] "Silly".

A second single from the album was released, titled [...] "Amnesia". The single failed to make an impact, however, missing the Billboard Hot 100 entirely.

2500|$|The album Music from Big Pink, in particular, is {{credited}} with contributing to Clapton's decision to leave the supergroup Cream. In his introduction of The Band during the Bob Dylan 30th Anniversary Concert, Clapton announced that in 1968 {{he had heard the}} album, [...] "and it changed my life." [...] Nazareth took their name from [...] "The Weight" [...] - taken from the line [...] "I pulled into Nazareth, feeling half past dead" [...] Guitarist Richard Thompson has acknowledged the album's influence on Fairport Convention's Liege and Lief, and journalist John Harris has suggested that The Band's debut also influenced the spirit of The Beatles' back-to-basics album Let It Be as well as the Rolling Stones' string of roots-infused albums that began with Beggars Banquet. George Harrison said that his song [...] "All Things Must Pass" [...] was heavily influenced by the Band and that, while writing the song, he imagined Levon Helm singing it. Meanwhile, the Big Pink song [...] "The Weight" [...] has been covered numerous times, and in various musical styles. In a 1969 interview, Robbie Robertson remarked on the group's influence, [...] "We certainly didn't <b>want</b> <b>everybody</b> {{to go out and get}} a banjo and a fiddle player. We were trying to calm things down a bit though. What we're going to do now is go to Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and record four sides, four psychedelic songs. Total freak-me songs.
