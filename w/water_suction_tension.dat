40|$|Abstract: The varying solidness and {{the fast}} {{disintegration}} of overconsolidated claystones in man-made and natural outcrops are often an important geotechnical problem. These phenomena {{are part of}} a detailed investigation considering Triassic Roet claystones and Jurassic Opalinuston as examples from various locations in Germany. Changes in the clay mineralogy are insignificant during the fast disintegration process. Consequently there must be other reasons for the claystone to display a rapid disintegration. <b>Suction</b> <b>tension</b> in differently weathered claystones has an influence on the shear strength and the disintegration of claystone aggregates. In case of a similar mineralogical composition and chemistry of the pore fluid and at a certain saturation level, the <b>suction</b> <b>tension</b> increases with the degree of weathering. If the saturation level is low, the values of friction angle and cohesion are higher and high <b>suction</b> <b>tensions</b> are effective in the pore space. The <b>suction</b> <b>tension</b> is composed of two parts, a capillary one due to pore diameter distribution and an adsorptive one due to mineralogical and pore fluid chemical composition. High <b>suction</b> <b>tensions</b> decrease the tendency of disintegration of claystones. The adsorptive part of soil water tension obviously has a slight influence on the shear strength of the overconsolidated claystones of varying solidness.

The soils had varying amounts of clay fraction with plasticities ranging from low to high plasticity. The unsaturated soil behavior was investigated for six conditions, covering a range of compactive efforts and water contents. The experimental data were fit to four commonly used models for the <b>water</b> content-pore <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> relationship. Each model provided a satisfactory fit to the experimental data. However, the individual parameters obtained from the curve fits varied significantly between models. The soil water characteristic curves (SWCCs) were more sensitive to changes in compaction effort than changes in compaction water content. At similar water contents, the pore <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> increased with increasing compaction effort for each compaction condition and soil type.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate the suction capacity in clays by using neural networks on the basis of some simple soil properties.

These tests were carried out on seven different clay samples by using odometer test equipment. One hundred twenty six data sets were used in the training stage and remaining 42 data sets were used in the testing stage. The best model was determined by using a trial and error approach in which the ANN models were trained with different hidden layer nodes and with different combinations of network parameters. The neural network predictions were compared with the <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> test results.

As shown in Fig.  4 c, the volumetric water content of the substratum soil of the reclaimed farmland was comparable with that of the unaltered farmland when the <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> was below 5  kPa. However, when the <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> was beyond 5  kPa, the volumetric water content of the reclaimed farmland decreased very quickly to a low level and was less than that of the unaltered farmland. For most soils, field capacity was estimated at the water potential of –  10 to −  33  kPa (Brady and Weil 2008). The volumetric water content of the surface soil and subsoil of the reclaimed farmland began to be less than that of the unaltered farmland after the field capacity was reached, while the volumetric water content of the substratum soil of the reclaimed farmland started to be less than that of the unaltered farmland before the field capacity was reached, indicating that the substratum soil (sediment) of the reclaimed farmland drained water very quickly and had low capacity to retain water. There was difference in the shape and range in soil water characteristic curve of the two kinds of sampling sites shown in Fig.  4, which may be due to that there was more clay content in the surface soil, subsoil and substratum soil of the unaltered farmland than that of the reclaimed farmland, respectively, as shown in Table  1. The greater the clay content, in general, the greater the water retention at any particular suction, and the more gradual the slope of the curve (Hillel 1998).|$|R

A special apparatus {{was developed in}} which the soil <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> of several cells with soybeans growing in them could be maintained independently at a selected temperature. Transpiration was determined by a constant-water level device which recorded {{the amount of water}} used over a period of time. Photosynthesis and respiration were measured using an infra-red gas analyzer. The total nitrogen content of plants was measured by the micro-Kjeldahl method {{at the beginning and end}} of a ten-day experimental period. Leaf surface areas were determined with an air flow planimeter. In general with increasing soil temperature rates of transpiration, photosynthesis, and nitrogen fixation increased slowly at first and then rapidly until a certain optimum range was reached and decreased at higher temperatures. Maximum rates occurred around soil temperatures, of 30, 27 and 27 °C, respectively. The rate of respiration also increased with increasing soil temperature until an optimum range around 27 °C was reached and then dropped rapidly as the soil temperature further increased. Rates of photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration and N-fixation decreased steadily with increasing soil <b>water</b> <b>suction.</b> The decrease in the rate of these metabolic processes with increased soil <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> was attributed to effects of changes in viscosity and root cell permeability, stomatal movement and translocation of metabolic substrates. At low soil temperatures the dry matter accumulation seemed to be controlled by the water supply. At higher than optimum soil temperatures the dry dry matter accumulation was very sensitive-to temperature changes and less soil water dependent. When the nitrogen supply from the soil is limiting, the nitrogen fixation may possibly be a most important factor in the metabolic processes and thus the growth of leguminous plants.

Rates of dry weight accumulation for both shoots and roots were highest when temperature of the root environment was about 24 °C.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the consequences of forest fragmentation on various aspects of the water cycle. Soil properties, rainfall, throughfall and soil <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> were analysed for mature forest, secondary forest patches and large clearings. A total of 10 plots located on the south-western slopes of the mountain between 2100 and 2300 m. a. s. l. were monitored from May 2000 to June 2002. Annual rainfall amounts ranged from 2000 to 2600 mm with high spatial and inter-annual variability. Rainfall interception ranged from 3 to 9 % of incident rainfall in clearings, to a maximum of 32 % in forests. In general, soils under mature forest were wettest and showed only minor moisture fluctuations throughout the year. Soils of secondary forest sites were driest and soil <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> exhibited the largest fluctuations. Additionally, the finer texture of soils under mature forest compared to secondary forest sites allowed higher amounts of soil water to be stored for similar soil <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> levels. Ventilation and radiation penetration, which influence the magnitude of interception, evaporation from the forest floor and transpiration, were probably higher in fragmented secondary than in closed mature forests. In clearings, higher throughfall and presumably lower transpiration rates led to moister conditions compared to adjacent secondary forest sites. Thus, soil conditions under mature forest were most suitable for optimum water storage on Mt Kilimanjaro. The transformation of closed mature forest to a mosaic of forests in different stages of regeneration led to increased spatio-temporal variability in soil moisture.

Five week old wheat seedlings were exposed to these conditions. The dry weight of shoots and roots was determined at two day intervals. Plant material extracted was analyzed for phosphorus concentration. The color intensity was measured on a Bausch and Lomb spectronic 20 spectrophotometer of 420 millimicrons. In general, a constant growth rate, which was approached exponentially during the experimental period was found in all treatment combinations. Growth rate for both shoots and roots was slow at low root temperatures and had a maximum rate at a root temperature of 24. 0 °C. High soil <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> was a limiting factor in growth rate.

However, {{little is known about}} their integrated effect. To study that, field experimentation and modeling approach was used. Field experiments were conducted for 2 years (2006 and 2007) at Punjab Agricultural University Farm, Ludhiana on a deep alluvial loamy sand Typic Ustipsamment soils developed under hyper-thermic regime. Treatments included three dates of transplanting (25 May, 10 June and 25 June), two cultivars (PR 118 inbred and RH 257 hybrid) and two irrigation schedules (2 -days drainage period and at soil <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> of 16 kPa). The model used was CropSyst, which has already been calibrated for growth (periodic biomass and LAI) of rice and soil water content in two independent experiments. The main findings of the field and simulation studies conducted are compared to any individual, integrated management of transplanting date, cultivar and irrigation, sustained yield (6. 3 - 7. 5 tha- 1) and saved substantial amount of water in rice. For example, with two management interventions, i. e. shifting of transplanting date to lower evaporative demand (from 5 May to 25 June) concomitant with growing of short duration hybrid variety (90 days from transplanting to harvest), the total real water saving (wet saving) through reduction in evapotranspiration (ET) was 140 mm, which was almost double than managing the single, i. e. 66 mm by shifting transplanting or 71 mm by growing short duration hybrid variety. Shifting the transplanting date saved water through reduction in soil water evaporation component while growing of short duration variety through reduction in both evaporation and transpiration components of water balance. Managing irrigation water schedule based on soil <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> of 16 kPa at 15 - 20 cm soil depth, compared to 2 -day drainage, did not save water in real (wet saving), however, it resulted into apparent water saving (dry saving).

Plant yield, nitrogen and sulphur uptake and amount of S-urea mineralized were studied. The optimum conditions for ryegrass growth appeared to vary due to the interaction between soil temperature and moisture status. Increasing root temperature indicated a higher soil moisture content was required for optimum ryegrass growth. High soil temperature and low soil <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> decreased the percent plant nitrogen in 31 -day old seedlings.

40|$|Studying {{the soil}} {{moisture}} distribution {{over time in}} a given soil profile {{is the object of}} the present study. The way the soil moisture gets distributed over soil profile depends particularly on the soil texture and on the soil suction gradients developed. However, it changes continuously over time for a given soil depth. The method of determining the soil moisture distribution over time is based on the measuring of soil moisture suctions developed and the soil moisture contents in various times, but in a given soil depth (internal drainage method) [7]. The soil depths under investigation are four, starting from 0 cm to 60 cm, which means that the most important depth of soil profile is considered. Such measurements are supposed to be done over soil profile when the soil water flow is already ceased, in the conditions of preventing the evaporation [1, 7, and 9]. Therefore, to determine the soil moisture distribution over time, a plot of 8 m x 6 m or 48 m 2 with no plants was set. The tensiometers and the electronic devices for soil moisture content measurements were installed in four soil depths. The plot was previously wetted and covered by a plastic to prevent the evaporation. In this way, it was made sure that the only possibility for water is to move internally, which gave us the opportunity to measure the changes in soil water content and in soil <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> over time.

40|$|Study on {{the soil}} {{physical}} and hydrological characteristics under monoculture (cupuacu, pupunha) and an agroforestry systems (cupuacu + pupunha + urucu (annato) + castanha-do-Para (Brazil nut) with a cover crop of pueraria, in Manaus-AM (Brasil). The investigated soil showed an unusual behavior: the hydraulic conductivty was high close to and at saturation as it is commonly found in sady soils; however, at high soil <b>water</b> <b>suction,</b> it can retain large amounts of water which is a typical characteristics for clayey soils. This phenomenon may explained to the particle size distribuition (predominatly clay) and its strong aggregation. The sustainability of this soil is related with the stability of its aggregation, therefore the flocculation index {{may be a good}} parameter to evaluate its physical stability. 200...|$|R
