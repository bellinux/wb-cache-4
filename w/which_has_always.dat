5|$|Leslie is {{approached}} by scouts looking for potential candidates for elected office, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> {{been one of}} her dreams. Impressed by the memorial service and the harvest festival Leslie previously organized, they believe {{she would be a}} good candidate for upcoming city council seats, or possibly the mayoral position. With the expected increased media attention on her personal life, the scouts ask whether Leslie has any secret scandals in her life. She denies any such scandals exist, thus omitting her secret relationship with Ben, and the scouts promise to contact her about preparing an electoral run.|$|E

25|$|Syrian backing in the 1970s gave as-Sa'iqa a {{military}} weight {{far greater than}} its political influence, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> been small.

25|$|The Parliament's {{powers have}} grown {{considerably}} since the 1950s as new legislative procedures granted more equality between Parliament and Council.

25|$|The Commissar Order, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> had a {{particularly}} strong {{influence on the}} image of the Wehrmacht because of its obviously criminal character, has finally been clarified. Once again the observation has confirmed itself: the deeper the research penetrates into the military history, the gloomier the picture becomes.|$|E
25|$|The water-pumping {{station at}} Nut Hazel Cross {{was built in}} the 1950s to supply water from the aquifer to the growing {{population}} in the towns of Halton, Tring and Wendover. Despite enhanced levels of water extraction when groundwater levels remained high the road through The Vale to Chesham, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> lacked effective drainage was frequently impassable in winter months, and remains prone to flooding today.|$|E

25|$|Clarification of the interrelationships of the corvids {{has been}} {{achieved}} based on cladistic analysis of several DNA sequences. The jays and magpies do not constitute monophyletic lineages, but rather seem to split up into an American and Old World lineage, and an Holarctic and Oriental lineage, respectively. These are not closely related among each other. The position of the azure-winged magpie, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> been a major enigma, is even less clear than before.|$|E

The chinstrap is usually secured above and across the peak and secured at each end by a small (20 line) button of the appropriate regimental or corps pattern.|$|E

Due to his intellect and work {{capacity}} Munch soon rose to be one of the leading members of the new party. He was elected to parliament (Folketinget) in 1905, and would retain his seat until 1943.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} {{shield of}} arms of Serbia with 4 fire steels (but without the cross). The cross <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> {{been included in}} the shield of arms was removed for ideological reasons of socialist atheism. It was placed above a rising sun with a cog wheel symbolizing the workers and surrounded with a golden wreath of wheat and oak leaves, oak being a sacred Serbian tree. A red ribbon with dates 1804 and 1941 which refer to the dates of the first Serbian uprising against the Ottomans and the national uprising against the axis powers in the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|A rare, large crimson {{work with}} a single slash, which Fontana {{dedicated}} {{to his wife and}} <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> been known as the Teresita, fetched £6.7 million ($11.6 million) at Christie's London in 2008, then an auction record for the artist. Fontana’s Concetto Spaziale, Attese (1965), from the collection of Anna-Stina Malmborg Hoglund and Gunnar Hoglund set a new record for a slash painting at £8.4 million at Sotheby's London in 2015. Even more popular are Fontana's oval canvases. Sotheby's sold a work titled Concetto spaziale, la fine di dio (1963) for £10.32 million in 2008. Part of Fontana's Venice circle, Festival on the Grand Canal was sold at Christie's in New York for $7 million in 2008.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, Morricone {{was asked}} by Gorni Kramer and Lelio Luttazzi to write an {{arrangement}} for some medleys in an American style {{for a series of}} evening radio shows. The composer continued with the composition of other 'serious' classical pieces, thus demonstrating the flexibility and eclecticism <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> been an integral part of his character. Many orchestral and chamber compositions date, in fact, from the period between 1954 and 1959: Musica per archi e pianoforte (1954), Invenzione, Canone e Ricercare per piano; Sestetto per flauto, oboe, fagotto, violino, viola e violoncello (1955), Dodici Variazione per oboe, violoncello e piano; Trio per clarinetto, corno e violoncello; Variazione su un tema di Frescobaldi (1956); Quattro pezzi per chitarra (1957); Distanze per violino, violoncello e piano; Musica per undici violini, Tre Studi per flauto, clarinetto e fagotto (1958); and the Concerto per orchestra (1957), dedicated to his teacher Goffredo Petrassi.|$|E

25|$|Probably {{the most}} {{controversial}} area of reform was that of religion. The policy of state secularism ("active neutrality") met with opposition {{at the time and}} it continues to generate a considerable degree of social and political tension. However, any political movement that attempts to harness religious sentiment at the expense of Turkish secularism is likely to face the opposition of the armed forces, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> regarded itself as the principal and most faithful guardian of secularism. Some assert that a historical example is the case of Prime Minister Adnan Menderes, who was overthrown by the military in 1960. He and two of his Ministers were hanged by the Military Tribunal. However, their charges were not for being anti-secular. Although Menderes did relax some restrictions on religion he also banned the millet party which was avowedly Islamist. Further, the charges at the Military Tribunal did not involve antisecular activities and it can be concluded that Menderes was overall in favour of the secular system.|$|E
25|$|Following its {{purchase}} of WJZY in Charlotte, North Carolina in March 2013, Variety reported that Fox Television Stations was pursuing station acquisitions in San Francisco and Seattle as it desired {{to have a}} larger presence in the markets of NFL teams {{that are part of}} the National Football Conference (such as the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks), the conference to which Fox holds broadcast rights. Fox had for many years wanted to have an owned-and-operated station in the San Francisco Bay Area, <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> been one of the ten largest Nielsen television markets. After Fox Television Stations assumed ownership of charter affiliate WTXF-TV in Philadelphia in 1995, KTVU became the largest Fox station by market size not to be owned by the network. Fox's original parent company News Corporation (which spun off the network to 21st Century Fox in July 2013 as part of the company's separation of its entertainment and publishing assets) made several offers to buy KTVU, but Cox turned down each of News Corporation's proposals (Fox had also reportedly considered purchasing KTVU's CBS-affiliated sister station in Seattle, KIRO-TV, which would have displaced that market's charter Fox affiliate, KCPQ; such a purchase never materialized, although Fox did attempt to buy KCPQ outright before renewing its affiliation contract with that station in July 2014, after it was unsuccessful in pressuring Tribune Broadcasting to sell KCPQ by purchasing and proposing to move its programming to Bellingham, Washington-based KBCB).|$|E

500|$|This {{is a list}} of cricketers {{called for}} {{throwing}} in top-class cricket matches in Australia. In the sport of cricket, strict rules govern the method of bowling the ball.

500|$|According to Rubbra, the {{publication}} in 1911 of Holst's Rig Veda Hymns was a landmark {{event in the}} composer's development: [...] "Before this, Holst's music had, indeed, shown the clarity of utterance <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> been his characteristic, but harmonically {{there was little to}} single him out as an important figure in modern music." [...] Dickinson describes these vedic settings as pictorial rather than religious; although the quality is variable the sacred texts clearly [...] "touched vital springs in the composer's imagination". While the music of Holst's Indian verse settings remained generally western in character, in some of the vedic settings he experimented with Indian raga (scales).|$|E
