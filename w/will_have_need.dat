6000|$|... "He <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>need</b> {{of all his}} interest--but why hast thou come at this unseasonable hour? Thy visits {{are never}} too welcome, Gino, and when I have other affairs they are disagreeable." ...|$|E
40|$|The world {{prognosis}} {{foresee the}} increasing request for food. In {{only a few}} decades, the still growing number of the population <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>needed</b> nearly three times more food then now. In this connexion, the intensification of an agricultural production with new, environmentally harmless methods becomes an extremely important problem...|$|R
6000|$|... "There were, Mademoiselle; {{but those}} who were so, never {{complain}}ed; {{and those who were}} killed <b>will</b> never <b>have</b> <b>need</b> to complain again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I feel sure," [...] {{she said}} kindly, [...] "that Lord Eglinton <b>will</b> <b>have</b> no <b>need</b> of a proxy once he sets {{his mind on}} serious wooing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay!" [...] rejoined Diogenes lightly, [...] "'twere wiser to {{pray for}} Jan Tiele, or for Piet or their mates--some of them <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>need</b> of prayers in about five minutes from now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is of our {{boy that}} I wish now to speak, Mr. Goldencalf," [...] replied my mother, when her secret devotion was ended. [...] "The child <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>need</b> of {{instruction}} and care; in short, of {{both mother and}} father." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My master says," [...] was the answer, [...] "he {{thinks that}} all who see her <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>need</b> of her, since such loveliness is rare. But {{if you wish}} a name, well, one comes into his mind; {{the name of the}} knight Lozelle." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “My niece, for instance, {{who attends}} Rattan school, <b>will</b> <b>have</b> no <b>need</b> {{for the old}} tribal language,” he told the {{reporter}} with surprising prescience. “Why should she learn it?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We will go now," [...] I answered. [...] "She <b>will</b> <b>have</b> no <b>need</b> of {{anything}} that she has left behind. We will each choose a keepsake, and lock the rest up." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{person with}} healthy {{digestion}} <b>will</b> <b>have</b> {{lower risk of}} experiencing diarrhea, constipation, heartburn, bloating, flatulence, and indigestion. Additionally, a person with healthy digestion <b>will</b> <b>have</b> less <b>need</b> of digestive medications than a person {{who does not have}} healthy digestion.|$|R
6000|$|... "As you please," [...] said Moses, with {{heightened}} color. [...] "Allow me {{to remark}} that he who shall ever undertake {{to command the}} 'Sally Kittridge' <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>need</b> of all his experience--and then, perhaps, {{not be able to}} know the ways of the craft." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dora Bannister," [...] {{interrupted}} Miss Panney, [...] "it may be {{a little}} early to make bridal presents, but I want to give you this corkscrew. It is a very good one, and I think that after a while you <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>need</b> of it. Good morning." ...|$|E
60|$|Wherefore, I say, {{they both}} have and also <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>need</b> of twelve gates, and on them {{the names of their}} twelve tribes, with an angel at each, to {{encourage}} them to enter this holy and goodly city; and to tell them that yet he counts them his friends in whose house he received the wounds in his hands (Zech 13:6).|$|E
6000|$|... "Bo, {{our host}} <b>will</b> soon <b>have</b> <b>need</b> of his hunting {{abilities}} if your appetite holds," [...] said Helen, {{as she tried}} to keep her hair out of her eyes while she laced her boots.|$|R
50|$|In England it was reintroduced in the 16th century, {{traditionally}} {{with the}} return from Spain in 1585 of Sir Walter Raleigh, who also brought with him the first orange trees seen in England. Myrtus communis <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>needed</b> similar protection from winter cold and wet. Alice Coats notes an earlier testimony: in 1562 Queen Elizabeth I's great minister Lord Burghley wrote to Mr Windebank in Paris to ask him for a lemon, a pomegranate and a myrtle, with instructions for their culture— {{which suggests that the}} myrtle, like the others, was not yet familiar.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hé {{my little}} Joan of Arc!" [...] she said merrily, [...] "par Dieu, your eloquence, ma mignonne, has warmed up my old heart too. But, please God, our dear old country <b>will</b> not <b>have</b> <b>need</b> of heroism again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you come}} with me to the 'Lame Cow,'" [...] he said to his friend, [...] "we can eat and drink there and hear all the latest news. I want to see Cornelius Beresteyn if I can; he must be deeply {{stricken}} with grief and <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>need</b> of the sympathy of all his well-wishers. What say you? Shall we get supper at the 'Lame Cow'?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, I {{can easily}} {{believe that it}} was a very great relief to you, to {{acknowledge}} your situation to me, and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it. Your case is a very unfortunate one; you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties, and you <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>need</b> of all your mutual affection to support you under them. Mr. Ferrars, I believe, is entirely dependent on his mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{scales of}} justice must be nicely {{balanced}} to hang so long, without determining {{to one side}} or the other! You <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>need</b> of further assiduity, Don Camillo, and of great discretion in disposing the minds of the patricians in your favor. It will be well to make your attachment to the state be observed by further service near the ambassador. You are known to have his esteem, and counsel coming from such a quarter will enter deeply into his mind. It should also quicken the exertions of so benevolent and generous a young spirit, to know that in serving his country, he also aids the cause of humanity." ...|$|E
50|$|The program <b>will</b> <b>have</b> all the <b>needs</b> and {{benefits}} {{that are necessary}} for one {{to start a new}} venture.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{mind your}} hunger," [...] {{interrupted}} the Prince. [...] "I shall order you destroyed {{in a few}} minutes, so you <b>will</b> <b>have</b> no <b>need</b> to ruin our pretty melon vines and berry bushes. Follow me, please, to meet your doom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, petite maman," [...] he said cheerily, as {{he kissed}} {{the old woman}} on both her furrowed cheeks, [...] "keep up a good heart, and say your prayers with Rosette. Your old man and I <b>will</b> both <b>have</b> <b>need</b> of them." ...|$|R
60|$|A letter {{has just}} come down from Colonel Merewether saying that all is going on well at Senafe. The King of Tigré has sent in his adhesion, and numbers of petty chiefs came in riding on mules, and {{followed}} by half-a-dozen ragged followers on foot, to make their “salaam.” I {{do not know that}} these petty chiefs, who are subjects of the King of Tigré, are of much importance one way or another, but their friendship would be useful if they would bring in a few hundred head of bullocks and a few flocks of sheep. It is, I understand, very cold up there, and the troops <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>need</b> of all their warm clothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, you {{can take}} a hand-bag and {{sleeping}} things, but beyond a bit of soap and a towel I don't suppose you <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>need</b> of anything, for you will most likely sleep at some farm-house, or perhaps in a woodman's hut, and there will not be any undressing. There are six of us going from here, counting you, but the party is got up by two or three men we know there. They tell me some of the officers of the regiment stationed there will be of the party, and they will have a hundred or so of their men to act as beaters. I have a spare gun that I will bring for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You inimitable bairn!" [...] she cried. [...] "Did {{you think}} that I would let us part like strangers? Because I can never keep my gravity at you five minutes on end, you must not dream I do not love you very well: I am all love and laughter, every time I cast an eye on you! And now I {{will give you an}} advice to {{conclude}} your education, which you <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>need</b> of before it's very long. Never ask women-folk. They are bound to answer 'No'; God never made the lass that could resist the temptation. It's supposed by divines to be the curse of Eve: because she did not say it when the devil offered her the apple, her daughters can say nothing else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{order that}} they may have them small next season," [...] replied his dragoman. [...] "The future, sir; the future! The cycle of beauty and eternal hope, and, incidentally, the good of trade. Grasp that phrase and you <b>will</b> <b>have</b> no <b>need</b> for further inquiry, and {{probably}} no inclination." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye! wouldst think mayhap {{that the}} gods will interfere? They will? I tell thee that they <b>will!</b> but they <b>have</b> <b>need</b> of thee, Augusta! I, thy Cæsar, thy god do <b>have</b> <b>need</b> of thee!" ...|$|R
25|$|This {{approach}} (called MPQS, Multiple Polynomial Quadratic Sieve) is {{ideally suited}} for parallelization, since each processor {{involved in the}} factorization can be given n, the factor base {{and a collection of}} polynomials, and it <b>will</b> <b>have</b> no <b>need</b> to communicate with the central processor until it is finished with its polynomials.|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep your {{soothing}} {{words for}} me--you <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>need</b> of them all, in our coming time," [...] Ransom said, laughing. He {{pulled open the}} door again, which led into the lobby, but he was driven back, with Verena, by a furious onset from Mrs. Tarrant. Seeing her daughter fairly arrayed for departure, she hurled herself upon her, half in indignation, half in a blind impulse to cling, and with an outpouring of tears, reproaches, prayers, strange scraps of argument and iterations of farewell, closed her about with an embrace which was partly a supreme caress, partly the salutary castigation she had, three minutes before, expressed the wish to administer, and altogether for the moment a check upon the girl's flight.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aha, Richard," [...] says he, {{taking up}} the book, [...] "'tis plain whither your tastes lead you. Marlboro was a great general, and as sorry a scoundrel as ever led troops to battle. Truly," [...] says he, musing, [...] "the Lord often makes queer choice in his {{instruments}} for good." [...] And he lowered himself into the easy chair and crossed his legs, regarding me very comically. [...] "What's this I hear of your joining the burghers and barristers, and trouncing poor Mr. Fairbrother and his flock, and crying 'Liberty forever!' in the very ears of the law?" [...] he asks. [...] "His Majesty <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>need</b> of such lads as you, I make no doubt, and should such proceedings come to his ears I would not give a pipe for your chances." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have courage a-plenty, and, by G--, you <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>need</b> of it {{all with}} that of a Griggs!" [...] He gave me his bottle again, and {{assisted}} me down, and I found that my legs, save for the rocking of the ship, were steady enough. I followed him out of the hole in which I had lain on to a deck, which, in the half light, I saw covered with slush and filth. It was small, and but dimly illuminated by a hatchway, up the which I pushed after him, and then another. And so we came to the light of day, which near blinded me: so that I was fain to clap my hand to mine eyes, and stood for a space looking about me like a man dazed. The wind, tho' blowing stiff, was mild, and league after league of the green sea danced and foamed in the morning sunlight, and I perceived that I was on a large schooner under full sail, the crew of which were littered about at different occupations. Some gaming and some drinking, while on the forecastle two men were settling a dispute at fisticuffs. And they gave me no more notice, nor as much, than I had been a baboon thrust among them. From this indifference to a captive I augured no good. Then my conductor, whom I rightly judged to be the mate of this devil's crew, took me roughly by the shoulder and bade me accompany him to the cabin.|$|E
5000|$|The {{right of}} charity (sadaqa) {{is that you}} know it is a storing away with your Lord and a deposit for which you <b>will</b> <b>have</b> no <b>need</b> for witnesses. If you deposit it in secret, you will be more {{confident}} of it than if you deposit it in public... Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin ...|$|R
50|$|Not {{only was}} it {{important}} for children to be enrolled in education, but countries <b>will</b> also <b>have</b> <b>needed</b> {{to ensure that there}} are a sufficient amount of teachers and classrooms to meet the demand of pupils. As of 2010, the number of new teachers needed in sub-Saharan Africa alone, equaled the current teaching force in the region.|$|R
50|$|The song {{is a love}} ballad, with Mestari {{telling her}} lover that when they go somewhere {{together}} they <b>will</b> <b>have</b> everything they <b>need</b> {{for the simple reason}} that they will be with each other.|$|R
