Her father and brother abandoned the family when she was young, and her mother committed suicide in front of her. Feeling unwanted by her relatives, she sold herself into slavery so {{that she did not}} have to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything,</b> with Elias purchasing her. She is a Sleigh Beggy, a special magus who can draw magic from her surroundings and within herself, at the cost of dying young because of the strain in her body, hence why Elias took her in, hoping to prevent her death. She has about three years left to live naturally at most.|$|E

The authorities believe that the attack was perpetrated by Los Zetas, but the motives behind the incident remain unknown.|$|E

5000|$|Cinematographer Shawn Maurer shot Black Dynamite on Super 16 Color Reversal Kodak film {{stock to}} get the high {{contrast}} and saturated look common in many low-budget Blaxploitation films of the 1970s. [...] The film was then converted to digital for editing. The filmmakers supplemented their shoot with period stock footage from Sony Pictures Stock Footage, using films such as Missing in Action, Charlie's Angels, and Police Woman. [...] Black Dynamite {{was shot in the}} Leimert Park and Angeles Vista sections of Los Angeles over twenty days, with several green-screen days and one reshoot day. The film had such a low budget that they had to [...] "think in the same ways that they had to think" [...] in the classic blaxploitation movies.

That's why, about now, Katie had kind of slipped my mind. It wasn't that I wasn't fond of the kid, but I'd got so much to think about, what with having four young fellers under me and things being in such a rush at the {{restaurant}} that, if I thought of her at all, I just took it for granted that she was getting along all right, and didn't bother. To be sure we hadn't seen nothing of her at MacFarland's since the night when Andy bounced her pal with the small size in foreheads, but that didn't worry me. If I'd been her, I'd have stopped away the same as she done, seeing that young Andy still had his hump. I took it for granted, as I'm telling you, that she was all right, and that the reason we didn't see nothing of her was that she was taking her patronage elsewhere.|$|R

Alicia saves a patient's life in difficult circumstances outside of the hospital. But Lily dismisses her heroics and launches a verbal attack on Alicia in front of other Emergency Department staff. At the same time Lily had been dealing with the aftermath of her father's sudden death. Yu told Ellis that [...] "explored those extreme emotions without <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> else.

Yu believed that Lily felt remorse when she recalled how she had felt. But Lily realises that she has gone too far and [...] "it gets to the point where she's way beyond saying sorry." [...] Lily's treatment results in Alicia resigning from her position owing her decision to Lily bullying her. Yu hated being mean to Halfpenny during the filming of Lily and Alicia's clashes because they were friends off-screen.|$|R

In the past few days Jimmy had consumed too much hash to <b>worry</b> now <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> like a furtive glance. He had perceived Lord Wisbeach's roving eye, and had no doubt that at the conclusion of the meal he would find occasion for a little chat. Meanwhile, however, his duty was towards his tissues and their restoration. He helped himself liberally from a dish which his father offered him.|$|R

Berger and Calabrese claim that as the interaction proceeds we gain information that quickly reduces our uncertainties. However, there have probably been times where you didn’t really <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> finding out <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> the stranger because you never expected to see the person again or it wasn’t someone with whom you wanted to pursue a relationship.

5000|$|Supreme {{arrives in}} prison {{sponsored}} by Kareem Saïd. He {{is viewed as}} a threat by the Muslims since he preaches things that are as corrupting as they are enhancing. Rooming with Poet, he finds himself an ally to Simon Adebisi and the Homeboys. Since the Muslims are being led by Zahir Arif, Supreme claims Arif {{is nothing more than a}} [...] "Kareem Saïd wannabe," [...] and he attempts to convert a few members such as Nacim Bismilla. When Arif asks Adebisi to kill Supreme, Supreme and the other Homeboys tell Arif to watch where he walks. Being on Adebisi's good side while Oz is under the management of Martin Querns, Supreme is having a good time in Em City, not <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>anything</b> for the most part. Querns even names him and Poet trustees when the Italian and Latino inmates are transferred out of Em City. Supreme informs the black inmates (mainly Leroy Tidd and Mondo Browne) that they are being out-sold in drugs by Jamaican inmate Desmond Mobay whom he and Adebisi don't fully trust. This situation builds into tension between Supreme and Browne. Adebisi steps in to stop them from fighting. With only a few white inmates left in Em City, Ryan O'Reily and Christopher Keller (both white) conspire to disrupt Querns' system. They first murder Nate Shemin and then Mondo Browne. They successfully frame Supreme for the murders by planting Supreme's necklace at the scene and the murder weapon in Supreme's pod. The evidence is enough for Querns, who allows Supreme to be beaten by Adebisi and the all black correctional officers for ending Quern's streak of no violence. Supreme is sent to isolation and will stand trial for two counts of murder.|$|R
