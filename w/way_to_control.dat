5|$|Another sort of {{risk that}} can affect dry cargoes, is {{absorption}} of ambient moisture. When very fine concretes and aggregates mix with water, the mud created {{at the bottom of}} the hold shifts easily and can produce a free surface effect. The only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> these risks is by good ventilation practices and careful monitoring for the presence of water.|$|E
5|$|Soluble ionic {{compounds}} like salt {{can easily}} be dissolved to provide electrolyte solutions. This is a simple <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the concentration and ionic strength. The concentration of solutes affects many colligative properties, including increasing the osmotic pressure, and causing freezing-point depression and boiling-point elevation. Because the solutes are charged ions they also increase the electrical conductivity of the solution. The increased ionic strength reduces {{the thickness of the}} electrical double layer around colloidal particles, and therefore the stability of emulsions and suspensions.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} shows the golden white-eye once also occurred on Tinian and Rota but was extirpated in those locations through {{the impact of}} human activities. Despite its current abundance on Saipan and Aguijan, {{and the fact that}} it has among the highest recorded densities for any bird, it is nevertheless considered to be critically endangered. It is threatened by the invasive brown tree snake, which has become established on nearby Guam, and this predator is expected to cause a rapid decline in the population if it reaches Saipan. Efforts are under <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the snakes and breed the white-eye in zoos.|$|E

5|$|Hansen soon finds Bakharev, {{who tells}} him that to disable the radio jammer around the rig so he can contact Bennett, he will need Anischenko to get him past a retinal scanner. Bakharev is then dragged into an air duct and killed. Hansen learns that Kamsky and Bakharev were under orders to make the exocels as {{dangerous}} as possible, which they had succeeded in doing, but without any <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> the resulting creatures. Hansen finds and kills Anischenko, removing his eye and using it to deactivate the radio jammer. Once {{back in touch with}} Bennett, Hansen is told he must find Kamsky's laptop and transmit the exocel research. Meanwhile, Anna is rescued from the sea by a large creature and left in a lab, where she is infected by an exocel. Seeing this take place on a security monitor, Hansen races to the lab to give Anna the antidote.|$|E
5|$|Saiga and Suitengu {{engage in}} a game of cat and mouse; Saiga and Kagura manage to evade capture several times before Suitengu himself attacks Saiga, {{severely}} injuring him, and takes Kagura captive. To take over Tennōzu Group, Suitengu murders its president, Shinsen Tennōzu, who also is Kagura's mother. Kagura inherits the group, so Suitengu marries her and takes legal control of it. Saiga, having recovered from his wounds, interrupts the wedding and rescues Kagura. Together, they attempt to leave Japan but are enticed back by the prospect of defeating Suitengu once and for all. The plan, however, ends up being a trap set up by Prime Minister Kamiya, Seiji Ochiai and other Cabinet members as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>control</b> Suitengu and take control over the club. But, Suitengu knew of their betrayal and after trapping all the Cabinet members, the police superintendent and other members of government inside the club, he went to Kamiya's mansion to exact his revenge against him. He then took away Kagura from Saiga by promising not to kill Saiga if Kagura comes with him willingly. Saiga and his policewoman friend Hibari Ginza make one final attack on Suitengu's stronghold - the main building of Tennōzu Group. In addition, a group of politicians from around the world fire missiles at Tokyo to kill Suitengu. Saiga and Suitengu battle, but Saiga is unable to defeat Suitengu before going blind from overusing his power. Suitengu spares Saiga's life, and, in a final act of defiance, destroys all the money he gathered before being killed by the missiles. The world collapses into a financial crisis, but Saiga and Kagura finally reunite, no longer under threat of attack.|$|E
