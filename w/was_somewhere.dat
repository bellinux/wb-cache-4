5|$|The {{location}} of the battle is still debated among historians. One theory gives the {{location of}} the battle at Loviştea, in some mountain gorges, in the valley of Olt, Transylvania. However, Romanian historian Neagu Djuvara denies this and states that the {{location of the}} battle <b>was</b> <b>somewhere</b> at the border between Oltenia and Severin.|$|E
5|$|Writer Rhianna Pratchett {{has said}} that the game's story {{examined}} why citizens would accept a life in a society where their personal choices were very limited. It also looked at reasons people might have for attempting to live outside the system and what could result from this. The society portrayed in the game <b>was</b> <b>somewhere</b> between what George Orwell described as an 'anti-utopia' and a Nanny State.|$|E
5|$|The Mission of the Guardian Angel <b>was</b> <b>somewhere</b> in the {{vicinity}} of Chicago from 1696 until it was abandoned in around 1700. The Fox Wars effectively closed the Chicago area to Europeans {{in the first part of}} the 18th century. The first non-native to re-settle in the area may have been a trader named Guillory, who might have had a trading-post near Wolf Point on the Chicago River in around 1778. After Point du Sable, Antoine Ouilmette is the next recorded resident of Chicago; he claimed to have settled at the mouth of the Chicago River in July 1790, a few months after Hugh Heward visited Point du Sable.|$|E

In {{the months leading}} {{to the release of}} Alien Crossfire, multimedia producer Michael Ely wrote the 9episodes of Centauri: Arrival, introducing the Alien Crossfire factions. The game initially had a single production run. Electronic Arts bundled Alpha Centauri and Alien Crossfire in the Alpha Centauri Planetary Pack in 2000 and included both games in The Laptop Collection in 2003. In 2000, both Alpha Centauri and Alien Crossfire were ported to Classic Mac OS by Aspyr Media and to Linux by Loki Software.|$|E
5|$|Pedrarias, who had {{established}} himself in Castillo de Oro, sent his deputy Francisco Hernández de Córdoba into Nicaragua {{to extend his}} authority over that region. While there, Hernández de Córdoba received news of a new Spanish presence to the north. Gil González Dávila was in the Olancho Valley when he received word that Hernández de Córdoba <b>was</b> <b>somewhere</b> nearby. Hernández de Córdoba sent out an advance party led by Gabriel de Rojas, who González Dávila received in peace. González instructed Rojas that neither Pedrarias nor Hernández de Córdoba had any rights over the territory, and that González would not permit them to take any action there. Rojas reported back to Hernández de Córdoba, who immediately dispatched soldiers from Nicaragua {{under the command of}} Hernando de Soto to capture González Dávila. The forces of González Dávila clashed with those of Soto at Toreba in Olancho; the exact site of the battle is unknown but was probably close to the modern settlement of Silca. Hernando de Soto camped at Toreba, where González Dávila caught him by surprise with a night-time assault supported by cavalry, crossbowmen and arquebusiers. A number of Soto's men were killed in the fighting that followed, until González sued for peace, giving González time for reinforcements to arrive, at which time González launched a renewed assault. González Dávila succeeded in capturing Soto, along with 130,000 pesos. Although he had won the day, González was aware that Hernández de Córdoba was unlikely to let matters rest, and he also received news that Cristóbal de Olid had arrived on the north coast. Not wishing to be surrounded by hostile Spanish rivals, González set Soto free and rushed north with ten horsemen and twenty infantry.|$|E

A few others argued that it merely accelerated remission in those patients who would undergo remission anyway. The consensus at the time <b>was</b> <b>somewhere</b> in between - claiming a success rate of about 50% in patients who had been ill for less than a year (about double the spontaneous remission rate) with no influence on relapse.|$|E

Studies in 1982 and 1996 both concluded that the rate <b>was</b> <b>somewhere</b> between 12 and 14 percent. A 1986 study by Daniel Lockwood put the number at around 23 percent for maximum security prisons in New York. In contrast, Christine Saum's 1994 survey of 101 inmates showed 5 had been sexually assaulted.|$|E

25|$|D'Estaing's {{fleet of}} 15 ships {{of the line}} left Boston on 3 November 1778 two days after Byron's {{squadron}} was blown off station and driven into Newport by more bad weather. Pearl was despatched to carry the news to Admiral Samuel Barrington; Byron was to follow {{two to three days}} later. Not knowing Barrington's precise whereabouts, Pearl at first sailed to Antigua, arriving on 4 December, before immediately heading for Barbados. En route, she stopped a Dutch vessel which had encountered a French warship out of Boston on the previous night. From the information received, Linzee deduced that d'Estaing's fleet <b>was</b> <b>somewhere</b> near Barbados and arrived there himself on 13 December.|$|E
25|$|Chief Seattle's {{daughter}} Princess Angeline {{continued to}} live on the central waterfront until {{the end of her life}} (she died in 1896). It is not known exactly where her beach shack stood, but photos indicate that it <b>was</b> <b>somewhere</b> just north of the present-day Pike Hill Climb. Also into the 1890s, the Duwamish camped on Ballast Island at the foot of Washington Street in the present-day Pioneer Square neighborhood. The mound had been created from ballast and other material dumped by ships. In the late 1890s, Ballast Island was planked over as part a continuation of Railroad Avenue south of Yesler Way. Later, it was dredged and became part of the harbor.|$|E
25|$|On May 28, 1977, the Beverly Hills Supper Club was {{operating}} beyond capacity, {{largely due to}} the popularity of that evening's Cabaret Room show, featuring popular Hollywood singer and actor John Davidson. Based on its number of exits, the Cabaret Room could safely accommodate about 600 people, according to the calculations of the Fire Marshal; on this night it was packed well beyond that capacity, with people seated on ramps and in aisles. According to later estimates based on seating charts and memories of those present, {{the number of people in}} the Cabaret Room at 9:00p.m. on May 28 <b>was</b> <b>somewhere</b> between 900 and 1,300.

25|$|When Demetrius {{arrived in}} Babylon, Seleucus <b>was</b> <b>somewhere</b> in the east. He had left Patrocles {{to defend the}} city. Babylon was defended in an unusual way. It had two strong fortresses, in which Seleucus had left his garrisons. The {{inhabitants}} of the city were transferred out and settled in the neighboring areas, some as far as Susa. The surroundings of Babylon were excellent for defense, with cities, swamps, canals and rivers. Demetrius' troops started to besiege the fortresses of Babylon and managed to conquer one of them. The second fortress proved more difficult for Demetrius. He left his friend Archelaus to continue the siege, and himself returned west leaving 5,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry in Babylon. Ancient sources do not mention what happened to these troops. Perhaps Seleucus had to reconquer Babylon from Archelaus.|$|E
25|$|In July 1780, Montréal was escorting six ships {{destined for}} Algiers. She {{was under the}} command of Captain de Vialis de Fontbelle, who was also in charge of the convoy. At 5:30 in the morning, on 30 July 1780, de Vialis de Fontbelle noticed that four vessels to leeward had taken up pursuit of the convoy while the convoy <b>was</b> <b>somewhere</b> between the Tower of Cachique and Cape Caxine, about 12 miles from the Cape. At 6:00, it was {{determined}} that the four pursuing ships were enemy vessels, and that a fifth pursuer was coming up. At this time, de Vialis de Fontbelle signalled the convoy to make best speed to the Tower of Cachique. He sought refuge under its guns as it was under the control of a vassal of Algiers. The French identified the pursuing British squadron as consisting of two frigates, two brigs, and a xebec.|$|E
25|$|Foreskin relics began {{appearing}} in Europe during the Middle Ages. The earliest recorded sighting came on December 25, 800, when Charlemagne {{gave it to}} Pope Leo III when the latter crowned the former Emperor. Charlemagne claimed {{that it had been}} brought to him by an angel while he prayed at the Holy Sepulchre, although a more prosaic report says it was a wedding gift from the Byzantine Empress Irene. Its authenticity was later considered to be confirmed by a vision of Saint Bridget of Sweden, who conrimed tht it <b>was</b> <b>somewhere</b> in Rome. The Descriptio laternansis Ecclesia, written shortly before 1100 indicated that a cypress chest commissioned by Leo III and placed under the altar in the Chapel of St. Lawrence held three caskets. One of the caskets contained a gold jeweled cross. The document stated that in this cross was the foreskin and umbilicus of Jesus.|$|E

The authority of the muhtasib, with his group of assistants, <b>was</b> <b>somewhere</b> between a qadi (judge) and the police, or on other occasions perhaps between a public prosecutor (or trade commissioner) and the mayor (or a high city official). Often a leading judge or mufti held the position. The muhtasib did not hear contested litigation, but nonetheless could prescribe the pain and humiliation of up to 40 lashes, remand to debtor's prison, order a shop closed, or expel an offender from the city. However, the civic authority of the muhtasib did not extend into the countryside.|$|E
25|$|Lazar's {{activities}} in the period between 1363 and 1371 are poorly documented in sources. Apparently, he left the court of Tsar Uroš in 1363 or 1365; he was about 35 years of age, and had not advanced beyond the rank of stavilac. Prince Vojislav, the strongest regional lord, suddenly died in September 1363. The Mrnjavčević brothers, Vukašin and Jovan Uglješa, became the most powerful nobles in the Serbian Empire. They controlled lands {{in the south of}} the Empire, primarily in Macedonia. In 1365, Tsar Uroš crowned Vukašin king, making him his co-ruler. Approximately at the same time, Jovan Uglješa was promoted to the rank of despot. A nephew of Prince Vojislav, Nikola Altomanović, gained control by 1368 of most of the territory of his late uncle; Nikola was about 20 at that time. In this period, Lazar became independent and {{began his career as a}} regional lord. It is not clear how his territory developed, but its nucleus was certainly not at his patrimony, the Fortress of Prilepac, which had been taken by Vukašin. The nucleus of Lazar's territory <b>was</b> <b>somewhere</b> in the area bordered by the Mrnjavčevićs in the south, Nikola Altomanović in the west, and the Rastislalićs in the north.|$|E
25|$|Leaving garrisons at Reggio and Scilla, Reynier marched north, {{picking up}} troops as he went. By 3 July, he {{assembled}} 6,440 soldiers near Maida, south of Sant'Eufemia. Verdier's division <b>was</b> <b>somewhere</b> to the north, much {{too far away}} to reach the field. When Stuart got news of the French presence, he called in his outposts at Sant'Eufemia and Nicastro. The British general mistakenly believed that he outnumbered his adversary. Stuart's seaside camp was supported by Smith's warships anchored inshore. However, some British soldiers were already down with malaria. Leaving 16 officers and 271 men of de Watteville's Swiss Regiment to guard the camp, Stuart marched to the south down the beach. Spotting this maneuver from his hilltop position near Maida, Reynier set his force in motion to attack the British force. He gauged that his advance would strike his enemies {{at the mouth of the}} Amato River. Seeing the French approach, Stuart halted his column, faced his troops inland, and moved forward to meet the French. The battleground was in a scrub-covered plain on the north side of the swampy Amato River. Whereas Stuart's force was in echelon with his right leading, Reynier's division was in echelon with his left leading. Therefore, the British right and the French left became engaged first.|$|E
