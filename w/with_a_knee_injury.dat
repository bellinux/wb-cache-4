5000|$|Hampton faced Duke in {{a first-round}} match-up between two teams {{that did not}} make the tournament last year.

5|$|He {{missed the}} 1977–78 {{pre-season}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> <b>injury,</b> but recovered {{well enough to}} make 36 appearances throughout the campaign. Kaye was sacked after a poor start to the season, {{and was replaced by}} Bremner's former Leeds teammate Bobby Collins, who had joined the club as assistant manager in the summer; as at Leeds, Bremner had applied for the vacant managerial role, but was rejected. After being turned down for the job he announced his intention to retire as a player {{at the end of his}} contract in summer 1978.

5|$|In June 2011 {{he signed}} a two-year deal with Micky Adams' Port Vale. The League Two club had to pay Hyde a small {{undisclosed}} fee, as the Conference North side secured his contract from their partnership with the Glenn Hoddle Academy.

He did not feature in matchday squads for the rest of the season, and was transfer listed in May 2012. The door to the first team remained open though, after Burge had an encouraging and injury-free pre-season.|$|E

His season was ended on March 17 after suffering a leg injury when {{he was struck by}} Matt Hendricks of the Colorado Avalanche in a knee-on-knee collision.|$|E
5|$|Karthik {{was given}} more {{opportunities}} at international level in late-2006 during the ODI tour of South Africa, after Yuvraj Singh was sidelined <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> <b>injury,</b> and Karthik {{was given a}} spot purely as a batsman following the poor form of Suresh Raina and Mohammad Kaif. Karthik had opened the batting for Tamil Nadu in the previous season in the Ranji Trophy, {{as well as for}} South Zone in the Duleep Trophy. Playing in three of the ODIs, Karthik himself struggled, with 42 runs at an average of 14.00, and a top score of 17 as South Africa took a 50 whitewash.|$|E

5|$|Bertuzzi scored {{his first}} goal with the Flames, {{deflecting}} a Dion Phaneuf shot, on October 12, 2008, in a 5-4 overtime {{loss to the}} Vancouver Canucks. While initial fan reaction to Bertuzzi was negative due to his previous role with the division-rival Canucks, {{as well as his}} reputation following the Steve Moore incident, he was eventually accepted in Calgary. In January 2009, he missed five games due to a back injury. Several months later, he was sidelined again <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> <b>injury</b> and underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair damaged cartilage on March 3, 2009. Missing 11 games, he returned in time for the 2009 playoffs, where the Flames were eliminated by the Chicago Blackhawks in the opening round. He finished his only season in Calgary with 44 points in 66 regular season games, while adding a goal and an assist in six playoff contests.|$|E
5|$|Hackenberg {{was named}} the Big Ten {{freshman}} of the week after totaling 278 passing yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions, and Ficken was named Big Ten special teams player of the week, redeeming himself from the 2012 season, after kicking three field goals including a career-long 46-yard kick. Seniors DaQuan Jones and Stephen Obeng-Agyapong led the team defensively with nine tackles, including three for a loss, and a sack at defensive tackle, and eight tackles, a sack, a forced fumble that he recovered, and an interception at safety and linebacker respectively. After {{it was announced that}} Penn State lost senior tight end Matt Lehman for the season <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> <b>injury</b> during the game, O'Brien announced that Obeng-Agyapong might practice with the tight ends to help replace him.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Johnson missed most of {{the season}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> <b>injury,</b> and New York dropped to 4–10, {{resulting}} in Tarkenton being traded back to the Vikings. The Giants rallied somewhat in 1972 to finish 8–6. Journeyman quarterback Norm Snead (acquired in the trade for Tarkenton) led the league in completion percentage and had his best season. Other standouts and Pro Bowl selections that year were running back Johnson, who rushed for 1,182 yards (breaking his own team record) and caught 45 passes, tight end Bob Tucker, who followed up his 1971 NFC-leading 59-catch season with 55 in 1972, and defensive stars Jack Gregory and John Mendenhall. The Giants boasted the top offense in the NFC and after a season-finishing 23–3 win at Dallas to secure their second winning campaign in three years, the future looked bright. However, after the 1972 season, New York would endure one of the worst periods in its history.|$|E
50|$|Dec. 1, 2016 - Sophomore Bennie Boatwright out <b>with</b> <b>a</b> left <b>knee</b> <b>injury.</b> Expected to miss six weeks. Made return against Washington on Feb. 1 {{after missing}} 15 games.|$|R

5|$|O'Neill {{retained}} {{his place}} for the 1964 tour to England, and scored a century against Western Australia for the touring squad before departing for the northern hemisphere. After failing to pass 16 {{in his first two}} outings, he struck form against Glamorgan, scoring 65 and an unbeaten 109. He then added 151 and 17 not out, leading the way as the Australians defeated the MCC by nine wickets in a dress rehearsal for the Tests. However, O'Neill scored 98 in the first four innings of the opening two Tests and was forced out of the Third Test <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> <b>injury,</b> the only non-draw of the series, which Australia won. Nevertheless, he passed 50 {{in each of the four}} tour matches during this period, including a 134 against Yorkshire and 90 against Northamptonshire.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} the Raw Money in the Bank match, {{where all the}} wrestlers brought ladders. During the match, Evan Bourne {{performed}} his signature Air Bourne aerial maneuver, diving from a ladder and landing on the other wrestlers at ringside. Bourne and Miz went for the briefcase but Del Rio toppled their ladder, and Miz was taken backstage <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> <b>injury.</b> The seven remaining wrestlers simultaneously climbed four ladders in the ring, but fell off one by one. With nobody left in the ring, Miz hopped down to the ring and climbed the ladder with one leg, but Mysterio stopped him by slamming him off the ladder with a sunset flip powerbomb. As Mysterio and Del Rio battled {{on top of the}} ladders for the briefcase, Del Rio distracted Mysterio by unmasking him and then pushing him onto another ladder, which tipped over and sent both wrestlers to the mat. Del Rio regrouped and unhooked the briefcase to win the match.|$|E
5|$|Conroy was the Flames second-leading scorer in 2002–03 with 59 {{points and}} again in 2003–04 when he scored 47 points despite missing 19 games <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> <b>injury.</b> Shortly before the 2003-04 season began, Conroy gave up the {{captaincy}} after having {{decided it was time}} for Iginla to take over leadership of the team. He reached two milestones that season; he scored his 300th career point against the Vancouver Canucks on November 29, 2003 and played his 600th game against the Detroit Red Wings on March 16, 2004. The Flames qualified for the 2004 playoffs, their first trip to the post-season in eight seasons. Conroy was a key player for the team as they upset the top three seeds in the Western Conference, the Canucks, Red Wings and San Jose Sharks en route to a seventh game loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning in the Stanley Cup Final. He finished second on the team in playoff scoring with 17 points. Following the season, Conroy was named to play with Team USA at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, but appeared in only two games for the team.|$|E
