During his second visit to the UK in May 1896 Vivekananda met Max Müller, a noted Indologist from Oxford University who wrote Ramakrishna's first biography in the West. From the UK, Vivekananda visited other European countries. In Germany he met Paul Deussen, another Indologist. Vivekananda was offered academic positions in two American universities (one the chair in Eastern Philosophy at Harvard University and a similar position at Columbia University); he declined both, since his duties would conflict with his commitment as a monk.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the people}} to whom Jenner posed his {{question}} was Noel Stanton, a man from Bedfordshire, England, who was serving in Sydney with the Royal Navy at the time. Stanton became preoccupied with the memory of this meeting for several months afterwards and, the next year, became a committed Christian. Stanton went on to found the Jesus Army in Northampton, England, in 1969. In 1945, Jenner approached Norrie Jeffs, who had just returned from participating in Operation Meridian at Palembang on Sumatra, and, having asked Jeffs his question, Jeffs responded that he was already a Christian. Jenner then invited Jeffs over to his house, where Jeffs met several other visitors, including the <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> later become his wife. In 1952, another person Jenner accosted with his question on George Street was Ian Boyden, a man from Roseville who was serving in the Royal Australian Air Force. After having a brief conversation with Jenner, Boyden accepted Jenner's invitation to attend a church service at Renwick Gospel Hall, where he responded to the sermon by committing to living as a Christian thenceforward, which he did for at least fifty years. Many other people who had a brief encounter with Jenner on the street in Sydney also became Christians, but Jenner did not realise that any {{of the people}} he accosted had remained a Christian beyond their initial profession of faith until 1953, when Francis Dixon told him the stories of several such people.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{establish}} to {{what extent}} general practitioners (GP's) {{are familiar with the}} folic acid campaign of the Netherlands Bureau for Food and Nutrition Education, display a positive attitude regarding use of folic acid tablets by <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> like to become pregnant and factually provide information on folic acid. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, descriptive. SETTING: Regions: Central Brabant, Achterhoek, Randstad and Northern Netherlands. METHOD: In 1996 a printed questionnaire was sent to 300 GP's selected at random. It contained questions about knowledge, attitude and management regarding the use of folic acid by <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> like to become pregnant and with a normal risk to have a child with a neural tube defect. RESULTS: The response was high (81 %). Most GP's were familiar with the national campaign on folic acid (87 %), but 18 % considered themselves insufficiently informed about the education campaign and/or the folic acid recommendations. Half the GP's considered use of folic acid tablets by <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> like to become pregnant as important, while two-thirds were of the opinion that it contributed to medicalization of the pregnancy. Most GP's (82 %) thought that pregnant <b>women</b> <b>who</b> had not used folic acid tablets might develop feelings of guilt. Nevertheless, 64 % recommended use of folic acid tablets and 63 % were willing to write a prescription if the woman asked for it. Seventy-five per cent of the GP's reported that they themselves suggested use of folic acid tablets to <b>women</b> <b>who</b> they assumed <b>would</b> like to become pregnant, although most stated they sometimes forgot (58 %). The percentages of GP's who sometimes or always suggested folic acid tablets during a contraception advice after delivery or <b>who</b> advised <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> like to become pregnant to switch to a diet rich in folic acid, were much smaller (29 and 37 %, respectively). CONCLUSION: Although a large number of the GP's mentioned potential problems, the majority actively cooperated in promoting use of folic acid by <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> like to become pregnan...|$|R

25|$|Inheritance was by descent, {{but could}} be further {{restricted}} by entailment, which would restrict inheritance to male heirs only. In {{the case of the}} Bennet family, Mr. Collins was to inherit the family estate upon Mr. Bennet's death and his proposal to Elizabeth would have ensured her future security. Nevertheless, she refuses his offer. Inheritance laws benefited males because most women did not have independent legal rights until {{the second half of the}} 19th century. As a consequence, women's financial security at that time depended on men. For the upper-middle and aristocratic classes, marriage to a man with a reliable income was almost the only route to security for the woman and her future children. The irony of the novel's opening line, therefore, is that generally within this society it would be a <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>would</b> be looking for a wealthy husband in order to have prosperous life.|$|E
