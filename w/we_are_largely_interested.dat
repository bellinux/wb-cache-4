40|$|The {{key issue}} is why {{one should be}} {{interested}} in biotechnology indicators and why {{we are interested in}} collecting them. From the OECD point of view, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> <b>interested</b> in them from a policy perspective. There are also two other reasons for collecting indicators. One is because they are very much of interest to academics who can use indicators to develop a longterm or deeper understanding of how economies are structured and how economies can change. Second, indicators are of interest to private investors who can use the information to guide their investment decisions in one particular technology or another. But many of the indicators for investors come too late. This has always been a problem for us because the investment community really wants to know what is happening right now and by the time our indicators are published we are usually several years too late. From a public policy perspective, we are still really in the world of expectations when we talk about biotechnology, particularly modern biotechnology. I think we are all familiar with these type of expectations, and variations of them show up in many difFerent reports from all around the world. The problem with biotech is that many of these expectations have not yet been realized except in very small ways...|$|E

40|$|In the {{introduction}} of this book we argued that health education is both an immense and an unwieldy field, proponents of which have <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> <b>interested</b> in changing health behaviours. This chapter {{provides an overview of}} the theoretical terrain that informs our thinking about health education throughout the book. Our commitment is to a socio-critical approach, which questions the taken-for-granted. In other words, following Foucault (1977), our work in the following chapters endeavours to make the familiar strange. We pursue this line of analysis here and throughout the book, as a means to try and steer away from the usual conversations. The chapter serves to provide an overview of our analytical framework that informs how we have come to think about health education; to understand its history, place, purpose and its possibilities...|$|R
