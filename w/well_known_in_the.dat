5|$|Marshall {{opened a}} law {{practice}} in Columbia City in 1876, taking on many minor cases. After gaining prominence, he accepted William F. McNagny {{as a partner}} in 1879 and began taking many criminal defense cases. The two men functioned well as partners. McNagny was better educated in law and worked out their legal arguments. Marshall, the superior orator, argued the cases before the judge and jury. Their firm became <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region after they handled a number of high-profile cases. In 1880 Marshall ran for public office {{for the first time as}} the Democratic candidate for his district's prosecuting attorney. The district was a Republican stronghold, and he was defeated.
