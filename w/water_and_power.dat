5|$|By {{about two}} weeks after the storm's landfall, <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> service were being {{restored}} in Toamasina, although by that time, 40% of the communications network remained offline. By February16, the road from Antananrivo and Toamasina had been reopened. The Malagasy government imported oil for several months while its refinery was out of order. Non-government organizations provided rice to stabilize prices. The damaged rail line between Antananarivo and the coast was rebuilt in 2003. Schools that were repaired following Geralda were later successfully used as shelters.|$|E
5|$|During the {{aftermath}} of the storm, the navy, army, and local government devised a cleanup plan. Three hundred government employees (with guidance of the military) worked to clear debris. They quickly restored <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> service, and within a few days streets had been cleaned for most of the impacted area. Authorities in Manzanillo asked for medicine, clothing and food from nearby areas while the red cross treated the injured. Many of the displaced were evacuated to government offices. Within {{a few days after the}} storm, the ports of Manzanillo, Acapulco, Zihuatanejo and Lazaro Cardenas were reopened. The remnants of the storm later brought rain to the Rockie Mountains and the Southwestern United States. Eugene is one of three known July Pacific hurricane strikes, where hurricane-force winds are estimated over land. The other two hurricanes were Hurricane Calvin in 1993 and a hurricane that struck Baja California Sur in 1954.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Due to the {{emergence}} of new asymmetric <b>Water</b> diversion <b>and</b> <b>power</b> generation system, the traditional computational formula for Thoma stable section area has been unable to meet the design requirement. The discriminant formula for stable section of surge tank is obtained in this paper by theoretical derivation. There is a great influence on the stable area of surge tank because of the head loss between surge tank and branch pipe. Based on the definition of k-degree symmetric diversion system, the critical condition of <b>Water</b> diversion <b>and</b> <b>power</b> generation system is obtained. The hydraulic parameters of k-degree symmetric <b>Water</b> diversion <b>and</b> <b>power</b> generation system can be optimized through the critical condition formula. Research Background For the simple <b>water</b> diversion <b>and</b> <b>power</b> generation system with only one surge tank, the stable section of surge tank can be calculated according to Thoma criterio...|$|R

5|$|Otto and its {{precursor}} disturbance produced days of prolonged {{rainfall and}} gusty winds across the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Localized flooding and rough sea conditions caused extensive road damage, infrastructure failures, and some beach erosion along coastlines. During {{the passage of}} the storm, numerous residents were left without <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>power,</b> and a state of emergency was declared for several Caribbean nations. Schools, businesses and some government offices across all of the Virgin Islands and Saint Kitts and Nevis were closed until storm conditions abated. The weather system ultimately accounted for substantial monetary losses throughout these areas, pinned at over $22million (2010USD). In addition, Otto was widely {{regarded as one of the}} wettest storms in the history of the northeastern Caribbean, repeatedly shattering various rainfall records.|$|E
5|$|For {{several days}} while {{offshore}} western Madagascar, Haruna dropped greater than normal rainfall. The storm ultimately made landfall about 15hours faster than anticipated. Winds and rainfall from Haruna damaged houses and power systems, and also damaged 265classrooms and 16health facilities. There was also {{damage to the}} rice and maize crops from high winds near the coast, causing food shortages. Rains from the storm caused a dyke along the Fiherenana River to break, which flooded a large region and forced about 6,000people to evacuate their homes. The flooding from the dyke break was worst in Toliara, where most residents lost access to fresh <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>power.</b> Flooding in the city caused the temporarily closure of the airport there. The town of Morombe was temporarily isolated after the road was blocked. Power outages affected Morombe, Toliara, Sakaraha, and Betioky Sud. Downed trees had affected roads near Toliara but were quickly removed. About 1,050houses were flooded, another 691 lost their roofs, and 7,402 were destroyed, leaving 13,882people homeless. Overall, Haruna killed 26people and injured another 127.|$|E
5|$|In western Grenada, high waves {{affected}} {{much of the}} coastline, destroying 21small {{boats and}} causing significant beach erosion. The waves covered the entire Grand Anse Beach in Saint George Parish. The erosion heavily impacted tourist areas and also threatened {{the foundation of the}} runway at the Maurice Bishop International Airport. Storm damage cut off the towns in western Grenada from the capital city of Saint George's. The cut-off roads resulted in an island-wide fuel shortage. In Saint John Parish, the storm knocked out the <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> supply and forced several families to evacuate their damaged houses. The small island Carriacou, located north of Grenada, sustained damage to the road to its primary airport. At least 10homes were destroyed in the country, and damage totaled $94.6million; this represented 27percent of the island's gross domestic product. Effects from the storm reached as far south as Trinidad and Tobago. In the country, storm surge caused damage to boats and coastal structures, while beach erosion was reported in Tobago.|$|E

5|$|O'Shaughnessy Dam {{has been}} {{controversial}} since its original construction both for its environmental impact and {{violations of the}} Raker Act {{by the city of}} San Francisco. Although the Raker Act explicitly stated that power and water from the Hetch Hetchy Project could be used only for public purposes, San Francisco has sold Hetch Hetchy power to Pacific Gas & Electric (PG) since 1925. Dam removal advocates have stated that San Francisco's utilization of Yosemite National Park for <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> is unfair because of the damage to tourism and the local environment caused by the dam and reservoir. By draining the reservoir, removing the dam and restoring the valley to its original state, visitors to the park would once again be able to enjoy the natural beauty of Hetch Hetchy – once compared to that of Yosemite Valley. There are other rivers and reservoirs available for San Francisco to replace the water supply, such as the city's currently unused share of water in Lake Don Pedro, the biggest reservoir on the Tuolumne River.|$|E
5|$|By late June and {{throughout}} July, northern Dalmatia saw daily armed skirmishes but no actual combat. Nonetheless, the increasing {{intensity of the}} conflict in the region and elsewhere in Croatia led to the preparation of bomb shelters in Zadar by city officials. Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Krajina (SAO Krajina) authorities called up three Territorial Defence units in the Zadar hinterland on 11 July, one day after another fatal shooting of a Croatian police patrol in the Zadar area, while the JNA 9th (Knin) Corps conscripted the local Serb population in Benkovac to strengthen its ranks {{by the end of the}} month. In late July, a paramilitary group, led by Miro Barešić and formally subordinated to the Croatian Ministry of Defence, conducted several sabotages in the Benkovac area. On 1 August, Croatia deployed two battalions of the ZNG 4th Guards Brigade to Kruševo near Obrovac. Two days later they engaged in combat against the SAO Krajina Territorial Defence and police forces, marking the first such engagement of the Croatian War of Independence in the region. On 26 August, the JNA 9th (Knin) Corps openly sided with the SAO Krajina forces as they jointly attacked Kijevo, expelling all Croats from the village. Another significant setback for Croatia in the region was JNA capture of the Maslenica Bridge on 11 September. That severed the last overland road link between Dalmatia and the rest of Croatia. On 1113 September, an attack in the area of Skradin cut <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> supply to Šibenik.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{few days}} after the {{hurricane}} passed, the Grenada Emergency Operations Center temporarily prevented relief supplies from entering the country to ensure the safety of the incoming items; the decision was reversed shortly thereafter, and planes flew supplies during daylight hours into the reopened airport. Severe looting occurred in the immediate aftermath of Ivan, prompting police officials to enact a curfew for the night hours. In the first week following the hurricane, aid was slow to the affected residents, due to the lack of an efficient aid distribution system. 30official shelters and 17prepared ones housed over 5,000people in the aftermath of the storm. Thousands of people lost their jobs due to the hurricane, with all businesses shut down following the hurricane. By two months after the hurricane struck, 65schools were opened, some of which serving as shelters; <b>water</b> <b>and</b> <b>power</b> were gradually restored to the island. By a year after the storm's passage, all schools were reopened, and most buildings enacted provisional repairs. Officials determined around 10,000houses on the island required complete reconstruction, while a further 22,000 needed repairs. The government of Grenada initially planned to rebuild 1,000houses in the year after the hurricane struck; by June 2005, 260families were provided houses, with a further 85under construction. The government also established a Material Assistance Programme, which provided $5,000 (2004XCD) of free materials to more than 5,000families, as well as a total of $4.3million (2004XCD) in low interest loans to 148families. Several indirect fatalities occurred in the aftermath of the hurricane, primarily senior citizens.|$|E
