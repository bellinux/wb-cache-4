5|$|Development of {{the game}} began in October 2003. The {{overview}} {{of the game}}'s story was originally drafted before the first Knights of the Old Republic was released, after which it saw many revisions and also some major redrafts. In preparation to write Knights of the Old Republic II, Chris Avellone, the game's lead designer, tried {{to learn as much}} about the Star Wars universe as possible. He read many books, guides, modules, and graphic novels, and the Obsidian team also relied on the first Knights of the Old Republic and the original Star Wars films for inspiration. Avellone said that Obsidian recognized {{one of the things that}} made Knights of the Old Republic great <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> and the companions, and that they tried to expand upon this by adding more depth to them.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, Matilda Joslyn Gage {{took time}} {{out from her}} {{participation}} in the Revising Committee to write Woman, Church and State, a book which challenged traditional Judeo-Christian teaching that women were the source of sin, and that sex was sinful. Gage wrote that the double standard for morality hurt both sexes. Gage differed {{from most of the}} women on the Revising Committee in that she did not feel that the Bible, once interpreted in a more true, original form, would support women's rights. Gage determined that the Church had acted against women's interests in important ways: from Roman Catholic canon law, to Scripture, to its advocacy of celibacy and more. Especially troubling to Gage <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of Adam and Eve.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Famous Players-Lasky {{president}} Jesse Lasky {{was looking}} for a new Production Editor in the story department of his studio and Thalberg suggested Hawks. Hawks accepted and was immediately put in charge of over 40 productions, including several literary acquisitions of stories by Joseph Conrad, Jack London and Zane Grey. Hawks worked on the scripts for all of the films produced, but he had his first official screenplay credit in 1924 on Tiger Love. Hawks <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>Story</b> Editor at Famous Players (later Paramount Pictures) for almost two years, occasionally editing such films as Heritage of the Desert.|$|E

5|$|The season {{continued}} {{to focus on}} the surgical residency of five young interns as they try to balance the challenges of their competitive careers with the difficulties that determine their personal lives. It was set in the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, located in the city of Seattle, Washington. Whereas the first season put the emphasis mainly on the unexpected impact the surgical field has on the main characters, the second season provides a detailed perspective on the personal background of each character, focusing on the consequences that their decisions have on their careers. Throughout the season, new story lines were introduced, including the love triangle between Meredith Grey, Derek Shepherd, and Addison Montgomery, the main arc of the season. Also heavily developed <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> line involving Izzie Stevens' relationship with patient Denny Duquette, which resulted in critical acclaim and positive fan response.|$|E
5|$|The season's {{executive}} {{producers are}} Epitome Pictures' president Stephen Stohn, and CEO Linda Schuyler, the co-creator of the Degrassi franchise. Aaron Martin was promoted from executive story editor {{during the third}} season to executive producer. Degrassi: The Next Generation co-creator Yan Moore served as the creative consultant and David Lowe was the line producer. Sean Reycraft and Shelley Scarrow served as co-executive story editors. Brendon Yorke <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> editor, and Miklos Perlus the junior story editor. The editor was Stephen Withrow, Stephen Stanley was the production designer, and the cinematographer was Gavin Smith.|$|E

5|$|Whale {{directed}} his final film in 1950, a short subject {{based on the}} William Saroyan one-act play Hello Out There. The film, financed by supermarket heir Huntington Hartford, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> {{of a man in}} a Texas jail falsely accused of rape and the woman who cleans the jail. Hartford intended for the short to be part of an anthology film along the lines of Quartet. However, attempts to find appropriate short fiction companion pieces to adapt were unsuccessful and Hello Out There was never commercially released.|$|E
5|$|In early 1950, Disney {{produced}} Cinderella, his studio's first animated {{feature in}} eight years. It was popular with critics and theater audiences. Costing $2.2million to produce, it earned nearly $8million {{in its first}} year. Disney was less involved {{than he had been}} with previous pictures because of his involvement in his first entirely live-action feature, Treasure Island (1950), which was shot in Britain, as <b>was</b> <b>The</b> <b>Story</b> of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men (1952). Other all-live-action features followed, many of which had patriotic themes. He continued to produce full-length animated features too, including Alice in Wonderland (1951) and Peter Pan (1953). From the early to mid-1950s, Disney began to devote less attention to the animation department, entrusting most of its operations to his key animators, the Nine Old Men, although he was always present at story meetings. Instead, he started concentrating on other ventures.|$|E
25|$|On many {{occasions}} Jews {{were accused of}} the ritual murder of Christian children in what were called blood libels. The first known blood libel <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of William of Norwich (d. 1144), whose murder sparked accusations of ritual murder and torture by the local Jews.|$|E

It was directed by Howard Hawks and starred Wallace Beery. Although the movie took liberties with the facts, it became a great success, and Hecht received an Academy Award nomination for his screenplay adaptation.|$|E
25|$|There was no autopsy held on Dan or Steve, {{and there}} have been many stories about what might have happened. The {{arrangement}} of their bodies in the hotel suggests they may have killed themselves.

25|$|The {{story of}} the Dan and Ned Kelly has been told many times. There have been more books written about the Kelly Gang than any other event in Australian history. The very first {{full-length}} film in the world, made in 1906, <b>was</b> <b>The</b> <b>Story</b> of the Kelly Gang. In the 2003 Ned Kelly movie starring Heath Ledger as Ned Kelly, the part of Dan Kelly was played by Irish actor Laurence Kinlan. Orlando Bloom played the part of Joe Byrne.|$|E

25|$|In 1567 Brayne hired two {{carpenters}} {{to build}} a playhouse in the yard of the Red Lion, a farmhouse east of Aldgate near Mile End. According to Berry {{this was the first}} professional playhouse in the British Isles specifically built for that purpose 'since Roman times'. It consisted of a stage, with scaffolds for seating the audience, and Brayne is thought to have spent no more than £15 on its construction. The first play scheduled to be performed there <b>was</b> <b>The</b> <b>Story</b> of Sampson, on 8 July 1567, but nothing further is known about the performance or the theatre itself.|$|E
25|$|Borovansky's next ballet, The Black Swan, {{also had}} an Australian theme. It {{was based on a}} {{historical}} incident in 1697 when Captain Vlaming from the Dutch East India Company was exploring Australia. He discovered and named Rottnest Island and the river on which the city of Perth now stands. There were a large number of black swans on the river which drew Captain Vlamingh's attention and his crew captured several and took them back to Java. Thus, the main plot of the ballet <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of the Captain entranced by a black swan, which symbolised a new land. The ballet premiered in Melbourne in the Borovansky Ballet's 1949 season. The work was revived both in 1950 and 1951.|$|E
25|$|A large legendary {{and romantic}} history {{gradually}} gathered round {{the memory of}} Fitzwalter, as the first champion of English liberty. A picturesque tale, first found in the manuscript chronicle of Dunmow, tells how Fitzwalter had a very beautiful daughter named Matilda, who indignantly rejected the immoral advances of King John. At last, as the maiden proved obdurate, John caused her to be poisoned, so that the bitterest sense of personal wrong drove Fitzwalter {{to take up the}} part of a constitutional leader. So generally <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> believed that an alabaster figure on a grey altar-tomb in Priory Church, Little Dunmow is still sometimes pointed out as the effigy of the unfortunate Matilda.|$|E

25|$|Another major {{influence}} on Shakespeare <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of the intimate friendship of Titus and Gisippus as told in Thomas Elyot's The Boke Named the Governour in 1531 (the same {{story is told}} in The Decameron by Giovanni Boccaccio, but verbal similarities between The Two Gentlemen and The Governor suggest it was Elyot's work Shakespeare used as his primary source, not Boccaccio's). In this story, Titus and Gisippus are inseparable until Gisippus {{falls in love with}} Sophronia. He introduces her to Titus, but Titus is overcome with jealousy, and vows to seduce her. Upon hearing of Titus' plan, Gisippus arranges for them to change places on the wedding night, thus placing their friendship above his love.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the release}} of The Phantom Pain, many ascertained that the {{tensions}} between Konami and Kojima had {{had an effect on}} the development of the game which could be seen in the end product, specifically with regards to the storyline. The decision to force players to replay past missions to progress through the second half of the story was criticized, with one theory being that original content had been envisioned but which had not been incorporated into the finished game, resulting in the reused sections for time constraints. Another aspect that received similar criticism <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> ending, which many agreed felt abrupt and left several plot points unresolved. The general consensus was that such shortcomings with the design choices had resulted from Konami giving strict deadlines for the game's release, as well as their dissatisfaction with how much money Kojima had spent on development.|$|E
25|$|In {{desperate need}} of money, Anger wrote a book titled Hollywood Babylon in which he {{collected}} together gossip regarding celebrities, some of which he claims he had been told. This included claiming (with no corroboration or citing of sources) that Rudolph Valentino liked to play a sexually submissive role to dominant women, that Walt Disney was a drug user, addicted to opiates (reflected {{in the character of}} Goofy, who's perpetually stoned on cannabis), as well as describing the nature of the deaths of Peg Entwistle and Lupe Vélez. The work was not published in the United States initially, and it was first released by the French publisher Jean Jacques Pauvert. A pirated (and incomplete) version was first published in the U.S. in 1965, with the official American version not being published until 1974. Now with some financial backing from the publication of Hollywood Babylon, his next film project <b>was</b> <b>The</b> <b>Story</b> of O; essentially a piece of erotica featuring a heterosexual couple engaged in sadomasochistic sexual activities, although it refrained from showing any explicit sexual images.|$|E
