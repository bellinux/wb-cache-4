500|$|Susan meets Jim at the {{hospital}} and remembers him from the work he did on Lyn Scully's (Janet Andrewartha) house. They get talking and Jim reveals he just had a melanoma removed and he is a bit [...] "bewildered" [...] by {{the hospital}} process and Susan helps him out. Jim's condition grows worse and he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Susan learns he has no family and Woodburne said she instinctively wants to look after him. The actress said Susan crosses boundaries as she starts to neglect certain areas of her life, like her marriage. She tells Karl not to be selfish and that the situation is not about him or her, it is about Jim. Woodburne explained to Channel 5 that Karl's reaction to Susan's friendship with Jim changes and he starts thinking he should not be selfish. However, when he notices his wife becoming more involved with Jim and neglecting her responsibilities, Karl gets angry as she is not thinking about anything else. Susan and Karl's eldest son, Malcolm, returns to Erinsborough to help his parents work through their issues. Woodburne thought Malcolm was initially on Susan's side because he can see she is helping someone who is ill, but as he looks more closely he understands why his father is so upset with Susan's behavior. Susan is upset when she misses Jim's last moments and blames Karl. They begin rowing, which becomes worse due to Susan's grief. Susan Hill of the Daily Star revealed Karl and Susan were to separate following a make-or-break holiday. Their decision leaves Malcolm devastated and he takes his anger out on his mother, but Karl then admits it was his decision to end the marriage. Woodburne said the Jim Dolan plot was [...] "a tremendous story which highlighted problems with Susan and Karl's marriage." [...] The actress said the storyline was challenging to play because it was emotional and she had to slap Fletcher. Of Susan's future, Woodburne said [...] "2012 <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> year of adjustment for Susan. She is now single and moves into an apartment of her own – and she has to find her own way. She discovers things about herself that will surprise people." ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{are three}} {{important}} points to note. Firstly, to specify any one microstate, {{we need to}} write down an impractically long list of numbers, whereas specifying a macrostate requires only a few numbers (E, V, etc.). However, {{and this is the}} second point, the usual thermodynamic equations only describe the macrostate of a system adequately when this system is in equilibrium; non-equilibrium situations can generally not be described by a small number of variables. As a simple example, consider adding a drop of food coloring to a glass of water. The food coloring diffuses in a complicated matter, which is in practice very difficult to precisely predict. However, after sufficient time has passed the system will reach a uniform color, which is much less complicated to describe. Actually, the macroscopic state of the system will be described by a small number of variables only if the system is at global thermodynamic equilibrium. Thirdly, more than one microstate can correspond to a single macrostate. In fact, for any given macrostate, there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> number of microstates that are consistent with the given values of E, V, etc.|$|E

60|$|And {{since the}} Fabian socialists {{have created a}} {{widespread}} belief that in their projected state every man will be necessarily a public servant or a public pupil because the state {{will be the only}} employer and the only educator, it is necessary {{to point out that the}} Great State presupposes neither the one nor the other. It is a form of liberty and not a form of enslavement. We agree with the older forms of socialism in supposing an initial proprietary independence in every citizen. The citizen is a shareholder in the state. Above that and after that, he works if he chooses. But if he likes to live on his minimum and do nothing--though such a type of character is scarcely conceivable--he can. His earning is his own surplus. Above the basal economics of the Great State we assume with confidence there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> surplus of free spending upon extra-collective ends. Public organisations, for example, may distribute impartially and possibly even print and make ink and paper for the newspapers in the Great State, but they will certainly not own them. Only doctrine-driven men have ever ventured to think they would. Nor will the state control writers and artists, for example, nor the stage--though it may build and own theatres--the tailor, the dressmaker, the restaurant cook, an enormous multitude of other busy workers-for-preferences. In the Great State of the future, as in the life of the more prosperous classes of to-day, the greater proportion of occupations and activities will be private and free.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Today, {{clusters}} {{are very}} important computing resources and many computing centers manage their clusters in private networks. But parallel programs may not work in private clusters. Because hosts in private clusters are not globally reachable, hosts behind different private clusters cannot be reached directly in order to communicate. It <b>will</b> certainly <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> loss of resources if private clusters are excluded from the computing due to this reason. There has been much research on this issue, {{but most of them}} concentrate on user-level relaying because it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> general and easily-implementable solution. However, even wellimplemented, user-level solutions result in much longer communication latency than kernel-level solutions. This paper adopted a novel kernellevel solution and applied it to MPICH-G 2. Our scheme is generally applicable, simple and efficient. The experimental results show that our scheme incurs very little overhead except when small messages are transmitted. That <b>is,</b> it supports <b>a</b> more universal computing environment by including private clusters with remarkably little overhead. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{destruction}} of planets by migration into the star will release {{significant amounts of}} energy and material, which will present opportunities to observational study planets in new ways. To observe planet destruction, {{it is important to}} understand the processes of how this energy and material is released as planets are destroyed. It is not known how fast the large amounts of energy and material are released, making it difficult to predict how observable planet destruction <b>will</b> <b>be.</b> There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> amount of energy made available by falling deep into the star's potential well: Simple calculations show that many of the currently known "hot Jupiters" can potentially produce events as luminous as a small nova if the energy is released fast enough. To observe these events, the important questions <b>are</b> how <b>will</b> this energy <b>be</b> released, and whether the energy <b>will</b> <b>be</b> released rapidly enough to create an event luminous enough to be found by transient surveys. Alternatively, if planet destruction is slowed by the inward migration alternating with periods of outward migration caused by Roche lobe overflow (RLOF), then the primary signature may be the effects of the release of large amounts of gas. The infall of this gas also may significantly contribute to the system's luminosity. The release of planetary gas may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> searchable signature of planet destruction. Signs of runaway RLOF and outward or alternating RLOF should be searched for. Observing planet destruction will provide a new window for study of exoplanets. Comment: 24 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

This paper analyses the role of design in the economic and social development of China’ s political and cultural capital Beijing. We will try to identify the main success factors and barriers for the design business and show how design can be further used for social and economic development of the city. Backed up by conspicuous state investments and by fast decision making, industrial areas have been transformed and neighbourhoods have been revitalised, infrastructure has been upgraded, and some modern iconic landmarks are added to the collection of old monuments. Moreover, priority has changed from “Made in China” to “Create in China”, allowing economic activities to move upwards in the value chain.
