Reid explained that he wanted Sunderland to be challenging for European places, and will not be happy fighting relegation season-after-season.|$|E

He looked like a Brahmin sage, wearing matted hair (characteristic of a Shaiva) and the sacred thread worn by Brahmins across his chest. His body was smeared with sacred ash. The gods showered flowers on the Nayanar from heaven and the Brahmins cheered. With the Brahmins, Nandanar <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garbhagriha and saw Nataraja.

However, they have spent every season since in the bottom two divisions. The two clubs did not meet again in league football until January 2008 after City's fall back down the league structure.|$|E

5|$|During the 1947 royal tour of South Africa, Elizabeth's serene public {{behaviour}} was broken, exceptionally, {{when she}} {{rose from the}} royal car to strike an admirer with her umbrella because she had mistaken his enthusiasm for hostility. The 1948 royal tour of Australia and New Zealand was postponed because of the King's declining health. In March 1949, he had a successful operation to improve the circulation in his right leg. In summer 1951, Queen Elizabeth and her daughters fulfilled the King's public engagements in his place. In September, {{he was diagnosed with}} lung cancer. After a lung resection, he appeared to recover, but the delayed trip to Australia and New Zealand was altered so that Princess Elizabeth and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> King and Queen's place, in January 1952. The King died while Princess Elizabeth and the Duke were in Kenya en route to the southern hemisphere, and they returned immediately to London. They would not finally visit Australia and New Zealand until 1954.|$|E
5|$|Edrich then {{relieved}} Coxon, who had bowled {{his first}} seven overs in Test cricket {{for the loss}} of only 10 runs. Edrich bowled a bouncer, which Bradman tried to swing to the leg side, but the leading edge instead <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air and landed behind point. On 13, Bradman leg glanced a Bedser ball from his legs, narrowly evading Hutton in the trap at short fine leg. After one hour, he was on 14. Bradman had fallen twice for the leg trap in the previous Test. Bedser continued to the probe the Australian captain with inswingers, trying to extract a lofted leg glance in the vicinity if the waiting Hutton. In contrast, Morris was playing fluently and scoring many runs from the back cut.|$|E
5|$|Johnston then {{knocked over}} Charlie Barnett's stumps as the batsman leaned {{onto the front}} foot and inside edged the ball into his stumps for eight; this brought Godfrey Evanswho was given two livesto the crease at 6/60. Evans hit Johnston hard {{in the air to}} cover, where the ball went through Bradman for a boundary. The second {{catching}} opportunity <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same direction before traveling through Bradman's hand and striking him in the abdomen. However, Johnston eventually snared Evans, who hit a ball strongly, but straight to short leg where Arthur Morris took the catch close in, as England reached 8/74.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the next two days, the {{battalion}} withdrew towards Athens, where they arrived in the early morning on 24 April. They continued on to the beach at Porto Rafti, destroying their vehicles and other equipment as they <b>went.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> confusion of orders and counter orders, the battalion's carrier and mortar platoons had gotten separated from the rest of the unit. By 9:00pm on 24 April when the final move to the beach commenced they still had not arrived. The operation went according to plan however, and by 3:00am on 25 April the transports embarked. Of the various groups that had become detached from the battalion, some were able to make their own way to the embarkation beaches, but a number of them were ultimately captured. The battalion's casualties in Greece were 10 killed or died of wounds, six wounded, 83 captured, 11 wounded and captured.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{had only}} scored 41 runs in four innings between Tests, Harvey was {{retained}} for the Fifth and final Test at The Oval. England elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Precipitation in the week {{leading up to the}} match had delayed the start, and Yardley’s decision to bat was regarded as a surprise, as the weather suggested that bowlers would enjoy the conditions. This proved to be correct as Australia cut England down for 52 on the first day, with Lindwall (6/20) in particular managing to make the ball bounce at variable heights. Australia had already passed England by the close of play, reaching 2/153. The next day, Harvey came to the crease at 4/243 and quickly displayed the exuberance of youth. He hit Jack Young for a straight-driven four and then pulled him for another. Harvey then succumbed to Eric Hollies for 17, hitting a catch to Young, leaving Australia at 5/265. The Warwickshire spinner noticed this, and delivered a topspinner that dipped more than usual, and the batsman mistimed his off-drive, which <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air towards mid-off. Australia finished at 389 and then bowled England out for 188 to complete victory by an innings and 149 runs and seal the series 4–0.|$|E

5|$|Edrich {{came on and}} bowled a bouncer, which Bradman {{tried to}} swing to the leg side, but instead the edge <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air and landed behind point. On 13, Bradman played a Bedser ball from his legs, {{narrowly}} evading Hutton in the trap at short fine leg. After one hour he was on 14. Bradman and Morris settled down as Coxon and Doug Wright operated. The Australian captain drove the debutant Coxon through the covers for two fours, and Yardley made frequent rotations of his bowlers. At the lunch break, Australia were 1/82 with Morris on 45 and Bradman 35. Shortly afterwards, in the third over after the resumption of play, with the score at 87, Bradman was caught for 38 {{for the third consecutive}} time in Tests by Hutton off Bedser at short fine leg, just two days after falling the same way in the second innings against Yorkshire. According to O'Reilly, this was evidence that Bradman was no longer the player he was before World War II, as he had been unable to disperse the close-catching fielders by counter-attacking, before eventually being dismissed. O'Reilly said that {{this was the first time}} that Bradman had fallen to the same trap three times in succession. Australia reached 7/258 at the end of day one, before a lower order burst took them to 350 on the second morning.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} days of the operation, the 697th Regiment of the 342nd Infantry Division, {{supported}} by NDH units, thrust out of their bridgehead over the Drina at Zvornik and cleared the high ground southwest and south of that town, and south along the Drina valley road, hindered by roadblocks and destroyed bridges. It then followed up the retreating insurgents, mopping up the Drinjača valley, before pushing southwest through the mountains and reaching Vlasenica on 18 January. Parts of the 698th Regiment of the 342nd Infantry Division fought southwest from Višegrad along the upper Drina valley to Međeđa, while other elements pushed west towards Rogatica, followed by an Italian Alpini battalion. The 699th Regiment of the 342nd Infantry Division advanced along the Drina valley past the confluence with the Drinjača to the area west of Ljubovija, clearing roadblocks as they <b>went.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> area of Milići, they captured about 400 insurgents, mostly Chetniks loyal to Jezdimir Dangić, along with a tank, two machine guns, about 160 rifles and a large amount of ammunition. The regiment then mopped up the area west to Vlasenica and one battalion cleared the route to Srebrenica.|$|E
5|$|Support for Chovanec's {{comments}} {{was largely}} {{among members of}} parliament elected for the Communist Party. Others accused Chovanec of abusing the tragedy for his own political benefit. Some members of parliament, such as Miroslav Antl, Chairman of the Senate Constitutional Committee, commented that the licensing process is thorough enough, and pointed out that he considers carrying of concealed firearm as a necessity due to variety of reasons, especially in recent time also due to the rising threat of Islamist terrorist attacks. Roman Váňa, Chairman of the Parliamentary Security Committee and member of Chovanec's own Social Democratic party, refused Chovanec's argument, while some other members of parliament <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opposite direction, claiming {{that there are too}} few armed people among the Czech population, since a single armed civilian might have stopped Kovář's assault. The sentiment was shared also by, for example, Martin Koller, a former ambassador to Kuvait and Iraq, who said that an armed attacker may be stopped only by armed force, and who pointed out to a past well-known Czech case of a machete attack and to the Charlie Hebdo shooting, stating that both might have ended quite differently had the victims been armed.|$|E
