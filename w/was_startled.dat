5|$|Field's {{government}} <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> by Britain's {{announcement in}} October 1963 that Nyasaland would become fully independent on 6 July 1964. While no date {{was set for}} Northern Rhodesian statehood, it was generally surmised {{that it was going}} to follow shortly thereafter. Smith was promptly sent to London, where he held a round of inconclusive Southern Rhodesian independence talks with the new British Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home. Around the same time, the presence and significance of Section 111 of the 1961 constitution emerged in Southern Rhodesia, prompting speculation in political circles that a future British government might, if it were so inclined, go against previous conventions by legislating for Salisbury without its consent, withdrawing devolved powers or otherwise altering the Southern Rhodesian constitution. Fearing what the Labour Party might do if it won the next British general election (which was projected for late 1964), the Southern Rhodesians stepped up their efforts, hoping to win independence before Britain went to the polls, and preferably not after Nyasaland. The Federation dissolved as scheduled at the end of 1963.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} written {{record of an}} {{earthquake}} felt in the NMSZ was from a French missionary traveling up the Mississippi with a party of explorers. At 1 p.m., on Christmas Day 1699, at a site near the present-day location of Memphis, the party <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> by {{a short period of}} ground shaking.|$|E
25|$|Kim Bobo founded Interfaith Worker Justice in 1991 as Chicago Interfaith Committee on Worker Issues. Bobo had {{previously}} been director of organizing at Bread for the World and an instructor at the Midwest Academy. In 1989, Bobo became involved with workers' rights campaigns for coal miners. She <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> to find that almost no religious organizations had labor liaisons. She started an informal network of religious leaders to share information about campaigns for worker justice that year.|$|E

25|$|The {{details of}} {{the image on the}} shroud are not easily seen with the naked eye, but they can be more clearly {{revealed}} through photography. In May 1898 Italian photographer Secondo Pia was allowed to photograph the shroud. He took the first photograph of the shroud on 28 May 1898. Pia <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> by the visible image of the negative plate, implying that the shroud is effectively a negative of some kind. Pia was at first accused of doctoring his photographs, but he was vindicated in 1931 when another photographer, Giuseppe Enrie, photographed the shroud and obtained results similar to Pia's. In 1978, ultraviolet photographs were taken of the shroud.|$|E
500|$|Between 1959 and 1984, London {{contained}} the largest concentration of serial killers in the world, {{as the city}} <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> by 29 murders. [...] During that time period, up to six serial killers may have been operating in London, though three were convicted for 13 of the killings: Gerald Thomas Archer (the [...] "London Chamber Maid Slayer"), Christian Magee (the [...] "Mad Slasher") and Russell Johnson (the [...] "Balcony Killer"), with the other 16 murders still unsolved as of August 2015.|$|E
500|$|On 15 July 1895, Yeats and Olivia {{traveled}} to Kent to visit Valentine Fox; the trip Harwood says [...] "would have been, emotionally speaking a highly charged outing". Of the railway trip, Yeats {{wrote in his}} memoirs, [...] "when on our first railway journey together—we were {{to spend the day}} at Kent—she gave the long passionate kiss of love, I <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> & a little shocked". They went on to share more passionate kisses in art galleries and at her home.|$|E

500|$|Maximilian von Browne {{commanded}} the Austrian troops. Following the indecisive Battle of Lobositz in 1756, he {{was replaced by}} Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine, Maria Theresa's brother-in-law. Frederick <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> by Lobositz; he eventually re-grouped for another attack in June 1757. The Battle of Kolin that followed was a decisive victory for Austria. Frederick lost one third of his troops, and before the battle was over, {{he had left the}} scene. [...] However, later that year he won a spectacular victory against the Austrians at Leuthen, which secured Prussian control of Silesia {{for the rest of the}} war.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} the novel came in 1959, when Achebe heard {{the story of a}} Chief Priest being imprisoned by a District Officer. He drew further {{inspiration}} a year later when he viewed a collection of Igbo objects excavated from the area by archaeologist Thurstan Shaw; Achebe <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> by the cultural sophistication of the artifacts. When an acquaintance showed him a series of papers from colonial officers (not unlike the fictional Pacification of the Primitive Tribes of the Lower Niger referenced at the end of Things Fall Apart), Achebe combined these strands of history and began work on Arrow of God in earnest. Like Achebe's previous works, Arrow was roundly praised by critics. A revised edition was published in 1974 to correct what Achebe called [...] "certain structural weaknesses".|$|E
500|$|Seifert's {{performance}} in the game received high praise from reviewers. GameSpot's Justin Clark felt that the performance [...] "anchored" [...] the game. Katie Smith of Adventure Gamers wrote that Seifert is convincing in the role, particularly with small details such as body language, but <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> {{by the lack of}} emotion. Game Informers Wallace echoed similar remarks, noting that Seifert [...] "nailed the role". Rock, Paper, Shotguns Smith wrote that [...] "the whole thing might collapse" [...] without Seifert's [...] "convincing" [...] performance. IGN's Albert named the acting [...] "believable", stating that Seifert's performance is [...] "appropriately both grounded and absurd". Joe Donnelly of Digital Spy wrote that Seifert's performance has the potential to inspire similar games, and Andy Kelly of PC Gamer called the performance [...] "understated, realistic, and complex". Burns of VideoGamer.com felt generally impressed by Seifert's performance, but noted some [...] "occasional bad acting".|$|E

500|$|On July 3, Muenter (who {{went under}} the {{pseudonym}} Frank Holt) {{burst into the}} Glen Cove, New York home of Jack Morgan, son of financier J.P. Morgan, demanding that he stop the sale of weapons to the allies. [...] Morgan told the man {{he was in no}} position to comply with his demand; Muenter shot him twice and escaped. Muenter was later apprehended and confessed to attempted assassination of the vice president. Marshall was offered a personal security detachment after the incident, but declined it. [...] Marshall had been receiving written death threats from numerous [...] "cranks" [...] for several weeks. [...] "Some of them were signed," [...] Marshall told the press, [...] "but most were anonymous. [...] I threw them all into the waste basket." [...] Marshall added that he was [...] "more or less a fatalist" [...] and did not notify the Secret Service about the letters, [...] "but that he naturally <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> when he heard of the explosion at the Capitol." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after their}} marriage, Nebel said, {{he noted that}} Jones {{exhibited}} violent mood swings, and, at times, seemed to display a different personality. Nebel called this [...] "The Voice ... a look, {{a few moments of}} bitchiness." [...] The Voice usually vanished rather quickly, but the change was so drastic from Jones's usually pleasant demeanor that Nebel <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> and distressed.|$|E
2500|$|As the Partnair {{aircraft}} {{passed over}} the water at its planned cruising attitude of 22 000 feet, a Norwegian F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jet passed by it.

2500|$|Dick recounted {{that as the}} sun glinted off {{the gold}} pendant, the {{reflection}} caused the generation of a [...] "pink beam" [...] of light that mesmerized him. He came to believe the beam imparted wisdom and clairvoyance, and also believed it to be intelligent. On one occasion, Dick <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> by a separate recurrence of the pink beam. It imparted the information to him that his infant son was ill. The Dicks rushed the child to the hospital, where his suspicion was confirmed by professional diagnosis.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 September, Chamberlain flew to Bad Godesberg for {{his second}} meeting with Hitler. He said {{he was willing to}} accept the cession of the Sudetenland to Germany. He <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> by Hitler's response: Hitler said that cession of the Sudetenland was not enough and that Czechoslovakia (which he had {{described}} as a [...] "fraudulent state") must be broken up completely. Later in the day, Hitler resiled, saying {{that he was willing to}} accept the cession of the Sudetenland by 1 October. On 24 September, Germany issued the Godesberg Memorandum, demanding cession by 28 September, or war. The Czechs rejected these demands, France ordered mobilization and Britain mobilized its Navy.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was during}} his naval stint in Honolulu that Granger {{had his first}} sexual experiences, one with a hostess at a private club {{and the other with}} a Navy officer visiting the same venue, both on the same night. He <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> to {{discover}} he was attracted to both men and women equally, and in his memoir he observed, [...] "I finally {{came to the conclusion that}} for me, everything I had done that night was as natural and as good as it felt... I never have felt the need to belong to any exclusive, self-defining, or special group... I was never ashamed, and I never felt the need to explain or apologize for my relationships to anyone.... I have loved men. I have loved women." ...|$|E

The couple <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> by a loud noise at 8pm. MacLean went to her front door and saw someone emerging {{from the front door}} of Taylor’s home who she said was dressed, [...] "like my idea of a motion picture burglar". She recalled this person paused for a moment before turning and walking back through the door, as if having forgotten something, then re-emerged and flashed a smile at her before disappearing between the buildings. MacLean decided she had heard a car back-fire. She also told police interviewers this person looked [...] "funny" [...] (like movie actors in makeup) and may have been a woman disguised as a man.|$|E
2500|$|In 1986, Matsumoto {{suffered}} {{the last of}} a series of strokes, and was hospitalized, never to fully regain consciousness again. The stylish Matsumoto had been famously fastidious throughout his life, and his daughter, Meiko, has written that she <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> to notice that on his hospital bed, where Matsumoto lay unconscious and barely responsive, he had been using his remaining good hand to remove the pills that had formed on the old hospital blanket. Furthermore, although doctors said he had lost his sight, Matsumoto would open his eyes, and, as if looking in a mirror, would straighten the hairs of his mustache with his fingers as he had habitually done for years. [...] Matsumoto {{died at the age of}} 81. His cremated remains are interred in the Fuji Cemetery in Gotemba, Shizuoka, at the foot of Mount Fuji.|$|E
2500|$|Riis had {{for some}} time been {{wondering}} how to show the squalor of which he wrote more vividly than his words could express. He tried sketching, but was incompetent at this. Camera lenses of the 1880s were slow as was the emulsion of photographic plates; photography thus {{did not seem to}} be of any use for reporting about conditions of life in dark interiors. In early 1887, however, Riis <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> to read that [...] "a way had been discovered to take pictures by flashlight. The darkest corner might be photographed that way." [...] The German innovation, by Adolf Miethe and Johannes Gaedicke, flash powder was a mixture of magnesium with potassium chlorate and some antimony sulfide for added stability; the powder was used in a pistol-like device that fired cartridges. [...] This was the introduction of flash photography.|$|E
