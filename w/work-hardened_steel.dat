50|$|The <b>work-hardened</b> <b>steel</b> bar has a {{large enough}} number of dislocations that the strain field {{interaction}} prevents all plastic deformation. Subsequent deformation requires a stress that varies linearly with the strain observed, {{the slope of the}} graph of stress vs. strain is the modulus of elasticity, as usual.|$|E
50|$|The <b>work-hardened</b> <b>steel</b> bar {{fractures}} {{when the}} applied stress exceeds the usual fracture stress and the strain exceeds usual fracture strain. This {{may be considered}} to be the elastic limit and the yield stress is now equal to the fracture toughness, which is of course, much higher than a non-work-hardened steel yield stress.|$|E
50|$|The {{explanation}} {{hinges on}} the crystal's subtle change in dimension. Even a microscopic crystallite is millions of unit cells long. Since all of these units face the same direction, distortions of even {{a fraction of a}} percent become magnified into a major mismatch between neighboring materials. The mismatch is sorted out by the creation of myriad crystal defects, in a process reminiscent of work hardening. As in <b>work-hardened</b> <b>steel,</b> these defects prevent atoms from sliding past one another in an organized fashion, causing the material to become harder.|$|E
40|$|Argon is {{generally}} used as shielding gas for laser welding. As Argon is an inert gas it doesnot have {{influence on the}} microstructure of the weld material or on the heat input of the weld,whereas nitrogen has solubility to austenite. Therefore nitrogen as an interstitial atomincreases the hardness of the weld. This has been detected when comparing the hardnessprofiles of nitrogen shielded welds of austenitic stainless steel with Argon shielded welds. Nitrogen as the shielding gas can compensate the softer structure of the weld in workhardenedand nitrogen-alloyed steels. For the duplex stainless steel grades the nitrogen additions promote formation ofaustenite in the weld, which decreases the risk of lowered toughness. In this study theinfluence of nitrogen shielding gas {{on the strength of}} the laser weld has been examined. Thestrength of laser welds of nitrogen alloyed <b>work-hardened</b> stainless <b>steel</b> seems to be slightlybetter when using nitrogen shielding gas compared to welds for argon shielding gas. It hasalso been verified that nitrogen as shielding gas decreases the risk of weak toughness of laserwelded duplex stainless steel. Godkänd; 2013; 20131210 (andbra...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} is to evaluate the effect of manufacturing process upon the performance of reinforcing steel bars against atmospheric corrosion. Reinforcing steel bars produced by different manufacturing methods {{were exposed to the}} atmosphere in Athens for different periods of time. The progress of corrosion was evaluated by measuring the thickness of the corrosion layer formed {{on the surface of the}} bars. The morphology of the corroded layer was studied by optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), while X-ray diffraction analysis was used to identify the mineralogical composition of the corrosion products. Independently of the manufacturing process used, the main corrosion product formed was lepidocrocite (gamma-FeOOH), followed closely by akaganeite (beta-FeOOH) and goethite (alpha-FeOOH). Furthermore, it was found that the surface condition and the initial oxide layer on the steel bars, which is closely related to the manufacturing process, played a major role in the development of corrosion in atmosphere. <b>Work-hardened</b> reinforcing <b>steel</b> bars were found very sensitive to exhibition in the usual atmospheric conditions, followed by the Tempcore steel bars. The hot-rolled bars, either unalloyed or microalloyed with vanadium, presented the best corrosion behavior. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The {{research}} supposes {{the explanation}} of influence of stress impulses from an electrical discharge in water {{on the level of}} the limited endurance at a cyclic loading of the thermally <b>work-hardened</b> carbon <b>steel.</b> Methodology. Material for research was steel 45 (0, 45 % carbon) with сoncentration of chemical elements within the limits of steel composition. Specimens for tests are made as plates in 1 thick, width 15 and length 120 - 180 mm. The structural state of steel corresponded to quenching on a martensite from the normal temperatures of annealing and tempering at 300 C, duration of 1 h. Microstructure was investigated with the use of electronic microscopy, the density of dislocations was estimated on the methods of X-ray analysis. Hardness was measured on the method of Rockwell (scale of «C»). A cyclic loading was carried out in the conditions of symmetric bend on a tester «Saturn- 10 » at a temperature + 20 C. The treatment by shock voltage from the electrical discharge was carried out in water on setting of bath type «Iskra- 23 », used for cleaning of castings manufactures. Electric impulses were formed at 15 - 18 kV with energy of 10 - 12 kJ and amplitude of 1 - 2 GPа. Findings. As a result of processing pulses of a pressure wave of heat-strengthened steel 45 found the increase of endurance under the cyclic loading corresponds to an increased amount of accumulated dislocations on the fracture surface. The use of Coffin–Manson Equation allowed finding the decrease of deformation per cycle of loading as a result of arising stress from an electrical discharge in water. On the fracture surface (after pulse exposure) was found the increased number of dislocations, located in different crystallographic systems, that {{is a testament to the}} rather complicated development of dislocation transformations in the structure of steel, which provide an increase of endurance at a fatigue. The increase of the limited endurance became as a result of impulsive treatment largely related with the number change of mobile dislocations. For the area of low-cyclic fatigue the growth of amplitude of loading is accompanied with the decrease of distinction in the values of the limited endurance (before and after the treatment of shock voltage). Originality. For the field of high-cycle fatigue, the result of shock voltage of carbon steel with the structure of the improvements, the increase of limited endurance is accompanied with a decrease in deformation per cycle. As far as growth of amplitude of stress cycle the effect of increase of endurance from treatment of metal by the shock voltage declines. Practical value. Treatment of metal by the impulses of pressure waves from an electrical discharge in water can be used for the time extending of exploitation details of the rolling stock, which are subjects of the cyclic loading...|$|R
50|$|For {{an extreme}} example, in a tensile test {{a bar of}} steel is {{strained}} to just before the distance at which it usually fractures. The load is released smoothly and the material relieves some of its strain by decreasing in length. The decrease in length is called the elastic recovery, and {{the end result is}} a <b>work-hardened</b> <b>steel</b> bar. The fraction of length recovered (length recovered/original length) is equal to the yield-stress divided by the modulus of elasticity. (Here we discuss true stress in order to account for the drastic decrease in diameter in this tensile test.) The length recovered after removing a load from a material just before it breaks is equal to the length recovered after removing a load just before it enters plastic deformation.|$|E
40|$|Conference {{paper by}} two MEng students, Robertson and Dudorova {{as a result}} of a {{supervised}} master student project by Tim Stratford, John Gales and Jane Blackford. This work was supported with additional experimental contribution from H. Smith, L. Bisby and E. Vega. Prestressing strands lose strength and become more susceptible to creep deformation when they are heated during a fire. The consequent loss in prestressing force could under certain conditions result in structural collapse, potentially outwith the heated region of the structure. This paper describes a test programme characterising the changes in microstructure of steel prestressing tendons exposed to elevated temperatures. The residual strength tests, hardness testing, and elevated temperature mechanical test were performed to demonstrate how recovery and recrystallisation of the initially <b>work-hardened</b> <b>steel</b> produce changes in its mechanical properties at elevated temperatures. The research results of this paper are beneficial not only in the fire design of post-tensioned structures using modern prestressing steel, but also in the assessment of the tendons’ residual strength after being affected by fire...|$|E
40|$|The {{load bearing}} {{capacity}} of reinforced concrete structures after fire can be assessed if the modified mechanical properties of the building materials, designated here as 'residual', are known. In this respect, the residual properties of reinforcing steels produced (a) by the Tempcore process; (b) microalloying with vanadium; and (c) work-hardening, all falling into grade FeB 500 S, were selected for investigation, aiming to represent {{a wide range of}} steels currently available for the construction industry in Europe. For both the microalloyed with vanadium and for the work-hardened reinforcing steels typical diameters were investigated. For the Tempcore-type reinforcing steels, due to their heterogeneous structure, the effect of size and composition have been also examined. Specimens of the above types of steel were heated at temperatures ranging from 200 degreesC to 800 degreesC for 1 h and then cooled in air to room temperature. Thereafter, their residual properties were assessed by hardness measurements, tensile and Charpy-V impact tests. Metallographic analysis was used to correlate mechanical properties to microstructural characteristics. From the above investigation it was concluded that the Tempcore steels presented the more stable behavior up to temperatures of 500 degreesC, while the microalloyed steel, although it presented very satisfactory tensile properties, displayed low impact toughness due to coarsening of vanadium carbides. The <b>work-hardened</b> <b>steel</b> showed a continuous drop of its properties from approximately 250 degreesC and suffered from brittleness in the vicinity of 200 degreesC due to strain aging phenomena.
