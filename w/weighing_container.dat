40|$|Prior to {{handling}} test materials, performing equipment setups, and/or conducting this method, testers {{are required}} to read “SAFETY AND HEALTH ” in Section H of this method. It {{is the responsibility of}} the user of this method to consult and use departmental safety and health practices and determine the applicability of regulatory limitations before any testing is performed. A. SCOPE This test method is used to measure the proportion, by mass or volume, of coarse aggregate in fresh portland cement concrete. The test result may be used to determine compliance with Section 90 of the Standard Specifications. If tests are performed on separate portions of a batch, the results furnish a measure of the effectiveness of mixing. An Approximate Test Method and a Referee Test Method are described. In the approximate test method, the density of the fresh concrete is assumed. Test results (CT 518) from other batches of concrete should be used as the basis for the assumption. The referee method requires measurement of the density of the sample being tested. The Approximate Test Method uses the damp drained mass of the aggregate as an approximation of the SSD mass. The Referee Test Method aggregate is brought to SSD. In both methods the bulk specific gravity (CT 206) must be known if the volume of the coarse aggregate is desired. B. APPARATUS For the Approximate Test Method, the following equipment is needed: 1. Scales: Capacity of 50 kg, sensitivity to. 01 kg 2. 4. 75 mm or 19. 0 mm sieve, brass, full height, 300 mm in diameter, for wet sieving fresh concrete. A rigid type handle may be attached to facilitate washing. The sieve to be used depends on the test information wanted. 3. Three wash tubs or large buckets in which to submerge sieve-containing concrete in water while wet sieving. Use of hose and running water may be substituted. 4. Small scoop. 5. Dishpans: 22. 7 liters or other containers to sample concrete and use for weighing washed concrete aggregate. Tared mass should be established for each <b>weighing</b> <b>container</b> before starting any test. The following additional equipment is needed t...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Automatic {{weighing}} {{plays an}} important part in many fields of applications: Large quantities of commodities and raw materials are handled in trading centres using automatic belt weighers or totalizing hopper weighers for bulk-to-bulk weighing, smaller quantities of commodities being meant for end users are automatically filled and weighed by gravimetric filling instruments, by catchweighers or checkweighers. Commodities transported on vehicles or by rail are often weighed automatically by in-motion road vehicle weighing instruments or automatic rail-weighbridges, respectively. New developments and measurement techniques are especially observed in the field of waste disposal, <b>weighing</b> of <b>container</b> wagons in cross-border traffic, shovel dozers for weighing building materials, and automation of processes in the food and non-food industry.

30|$|The 18 F {{procedure}} {{involved the}} following steps. An 18 F sample was prepared in a 0.5 -mL volume within a 3 -mL plastic syringe. The activity {{was measured using}} a radionuclide calibrator (CRC 15 W, Capintec), and all subsequent measurements were decay-corrected back to this reference time. The calibration setting for 18 F (# 484) had been previously determined using an NIST-traceable 68 Ge/ 68 Ga mock syringe source that had been cross-calibrated for 18 F (X-Cal, RadQual, Weare, NH, USA). The radioactive sample was transferred from the syringe and mixed with approximately 30 mL of water in a closed container. Residual activity in the syringe was measured and subtracted from the original measurement to {{determine the amount of}} activity in the approximately 30 -mL solution. The exact volume of the radioactive solution was determined by <b>weighing</b> the <b>container</b> before and after filling using an accurate balance (XS 105, Mettler Toledo, Columbus, OH, USA) and an assumption of 1 g/mL for the density of water. In this way, the activity concentration (Bq/mL) in a stock solution was accurately measured. Five 0.3 -mL samples were pipetted from this solution and transferred to five glass test tubes with stoppers. The exact volumes of the radioactive samples in each test tube were determined by weighing each tube before and after filling. From the volume of each sample and the activity concentration of the stock solution, the activity in each test tube was determined (approximately 5 kBq). The samples were each counted for 1 min using the 409 - to 613 -keV energy window with background, deadtime, and decay corrections applied. The efficiency of the gamma counter for 18 F was determined by dividing the gamma counter data (CPM/ 60) by the activities in the samples (Bq). The entire measurement procedure was repeated on three separate occasions.|$|R

Load cells (1) and holder (8) move relatively to one another. Movements are provided pneumatically, by stepper motors and/or servomotors.

Measurement of semen volume was then made with either a graduated pipette or by weighing and assuming a density of 1 g/ml.

40|$|In France, 50 % of {{consumers}} sweeten plain yogurts prior to consumption. This study measured how much sugar consumers added under contextualized testing conditions. Participants (199 French adults who regularly consume plain yogurt adding sugar) {{were given a}} plain yogurt (125 g) {{at the end of}} a full meal and were allowed to sweeten it with their usual sweetener (caster sugar, honey, or jam). The quantities added were measured indirectly by <b>weighing</b> the sweetener <b>containers</b> before and after use; they were then converted into equivalent quantities of sucrose, or "added sugar. " Participants were asked to describe their relative hunger, thirst, and liking for plain yogurt and to estimate the quantity of sweetener they had added. On average, participants added 13. 6 g of sugar to their yogurts, which is higher than the 10. 2 g of sugar contained in pre-sweetened commercial yogurts (125 g). More sugar was added when subjects used jam (24. 4 g/yogurt, n = 36) as opposed to caster sugar (11. 0 g/yogurt, n = 134) or honey (12. 1 g/yogurt, n = 29). Age, socio-professional category, and BMI had a significant influence on added-sugar quantity. Based on behavior and attitude, participants could be separated into three evenly sized groups: "low sugar users" (n = 67, median = 6. 1 g/yogurt), who tended to control their food intake, "medium sugar users" (n = 66, median = 11. 4 g/yogurt), and "heavy sugar users" (n = 66, median = 19. 9 g/yogurt) who sought immediate satisfaction. To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide robust data on the amount of sugar consumers add to plain yogurts in contextualized conditions (self preparation during a real meal). Our findings show that consumers underestimated by half the quantity of sweetener they added. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
