25|$|Carson was {{nineteen}} {{when he set}} off with Ewing Young's expedition to the Rocky Mountains in 1829. In addition to furs and the company of free-spirited, rugged mountain men, Carson sought action and adventure. He found <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> in killing and scalping Indians. Carson probably killed and took the scalp of his first Indian when he {{was nineteen}} years old, during Ewing Young's expedition.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{hearing the}} first {{recorded}} vocals, Jones {{stated that it}} was exactly <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for.</b> The song begins with seven distinct synthesizer notes played on the Synclavier digital synthesizer, with Tom Bahler credited for the Synclavier performance on the song. The intro is taken note for note from a demo LP released the year before, called [...] "The Incredible Sounds of Synclavier II" [...] first published in 1981 by Denny Jaeger Creative Services, Inc and sold by New England Digital, makers of the Synclavier.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Something" [...] promo film is {{included}} in the Beatles' 2015 video compilation 1. Rolling Stone journalist Rob Sheffield comments on the significance of the clip, with regard to the band's history: [...] "each couple projects a totally different vibe – George and Patti peacocking in their hippie-royalty finery, Paul and Linda on the farm in Scotland with Martha the sheepdog, Ringo and Maureen goofing around on motorbikes, John and Yoko serene in their matching black robes. Each Beatle looks like he's found <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> – but they're heading for four separate futures." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Young Man and the Whore run away. The Young Girl {{wakes up}} dazed {{and says the}} final line of the play, “The Virgin! Ah, that’s <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> for.” ...|$|R

500|$|In {{the ensuing}} battle inside the volcano, Helga {{and the other}} mercenaries {{including}} Rourke are all killed. Milo and the others successfully fly the crystal back to the city, as the volcano erupts. With lava flowing towards the city, Kida (in her crystal form) rises {{into the air and}} creates a protective shield. The lava breaks away harmlessly, showing a restored Atlantis, and the crystal returns Kida to Milo. The surviving crew members return to the surface and promise to keep the discovery of Atlantis a secret. Having fallen in love with Kida, Milo stays behind to help her rebuild the lost empire. In the final scene, the crew members, having made their fortunes from the rewards given to them by the Atlanteans, speak with Mr. Whitmore and insist that the expedition was unsuccessful. [...] However, they do give him a small package from Milo, containing an Atlantean crystal and a note saying he found <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Jeckeln and his aide Paul Degenhart {{searched the}} Riga {{vicinity}} {{to find a}} site. [...] Riga was located in a swampy area where the water table was close to ground level. [...] This would interfere with the proper disposal of thousands of corpses. [...] Jeckeln needed elevated ground. [...] The site also {{had to be on}} the north side of the Daugava River within walking distance of the ghetto, also on the north side. On or about November 18 or 19 Jeckeln came upon Rumbula as he was driving south to the Salaspils concentration camp (then under construction), and it fit <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for.</b> [...] The site was close to Riga, it was on elevated ground, and it had sandy soil, with the only drawback being the proximity to the highway (about 100 meters).|$|E
2500|$|In 1938 Stewart had a brief, tumultuous {{romance with}} Hollywood queen Norma Shearer, whose husband, Irving Thalberg, head of {{production}} at MGM, had {{died two years}} earlier. Stewart began a successful partnership with director Frank Capra in 1938, when he was loaned out to Columbia Pictures to star in You Can't Take It With You. Capra had been impressed by Stewart's minor role in Navy Blue and Gold (1937). The director had recently completed several well received films, including It Happened One Night (1934), and {{was looking for the}} right actor to suit his needs—other recent actors in Capra's films such as Clark Gable, Ronald Colman, and Gary Cooper did not quite fit. Not only was Stewart just <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for,</b> but Capra also found Stewart understood that prototype intuitively and required very little directing. Later Capra commented, [...] "I think he's probably the best actor who's ever hit the screen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Addressing the exalted place Sequoyah {{holds in}} Cherokee imagination, the ethnographer Jack Kilpatrick wrote: [...] "Sequoyah {{was always in}} the wilderness. He walked about, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not a hunter. I wonder <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> for." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{mask that}} Mitch wears in The Way In is {{visible on the}} table in the last shot of The Way Out, and it <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> at when <b>he</b> first hears his {{daughter}} giggle.|$|R
50|$|During a banal {{portrait}} shoot {{he came to}} {{the realization}} that <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> at seemed to be more interesting to him through his lens than in reality. It was at this point that he realized that <b>he</b> would <b>be</b> an artist.|$|R
2500|$|The {{release of}} a new {{television}} series, , prompted a further revision in the depiction of Klingon culture, though Gene Roddenberry had wanted to avoid re-appearances of races from the old series. Set a century later than the original series, the USS Enterprise-D featured a Klingon crewmember, Worf. Makeup artist Michael Westmore needed a consistent reference to base the Klingon look on, as each individual Klingon had distinct head ridges. He found <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> in a book of dinosaurs: observing dinosaur vertebrae laid out flat, Westmore cut the designs in half and modified them to suit each Klingon. Westmore designed his Klingons' beards to be Elizabethan, combining prehistoric and aristocratic elements to give audiences a feeling of depth from the appearance. Over time, Westmore and the other makeup artists designed different sizes of prosthetic headpieces which could be quickly applied and modified to save time; the amount of preparation to turn an actor into a Klingon decreased from around three hours to one. While important characters had custom headpieces, background actors used pre-made masks with minor touchup around the eyes and mouth. The Next Generation effects artist Dan Curry used his martial arts experience to create a flowing fighting style for the race. When the episode [...] "" [...] called for a special Klingon blade, Curry drew on Far East influences to develop a weapon known as the batleth. Curry, a collector of weapons, was annoyed by fictional weaponry {{that was designed to}} [...] "look cool" [...] but could not be handled practically. Curry combined elements of the Himalayan kukri, Chinese axes and fighting crescents to create a two-handed, curved weapon that has since been widely used in the franchise.|$|E
60|$|Augusta winced, and Mr. Meeson, rising {{heavily from}} his chair, {{went to a}} large safe which stood near, and {{extracted}} from it a bundle of agreements. These he glanced at one by one till he found <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then {{they began}} to draw near the land, far, however, very far from {{the place where they}} had {{intended}} to go. Rollo observed that Jonas was looking out very eagerly towards the shore, and he asked him <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for.</b>|$|E
50|$|Simon Spier is a seventeen-year-old closeted gay teen {{trying to}} work out who <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>looking</b> for. But when one of his emails to Blue, his secret email pen pal, falls into the wrong hands, things get all kinds of complicated.|$|R
50|$|Bill, Boadicea, Chad and the {{musician}} walk over the downs. The children dancing and skipping to {{the musician}}s playing. They meet a real soldier who <b>is</b> <b>looking</b> for something, they ask <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>looking</b> for and <b>he</b> tells them <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>looking</b> {{for one of}} his medals.

6000|$|... "I think," [...] Berenice said, slowly, [...] "that {{he keeps}} as far aloof as {{possible}} for one reason, and one reason only. He avoids friendship, but he makes no enemies. He cultivates a neutral position whenever <b>he</b> can. <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>looking</b> forward to, I am sure, is to found a coalition Government." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{rigid and}} intent was he {{that you might}} have {{believed}} the muffled figure and the cocked hat to have been the statue of the man. <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> I could not imagine; but at last he gave a bitter curse, and, turning on his heel, he went back into the house, banging the door behind him.|$|E
60|$|Soon {{he came to}} a cool spot {{under the}} alders, which was {{probably}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for.</b> A small brook made an eddy there, and a lot of driftweed had collected over a bed of soft black mud. The stump of a huge cedar leaned out over it, some four or five feet above the water.|$|E
6000|$|... "After a piece," [...] Drummond resumed, [...] "I got his figure {{against the}} sky, and reckoned, because he looked short, he was wading in a pool. Felt I {{had to see}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for,</b> but knew I couldn't get near him along the bank. There are patches of gravel among the rocks, and the brush grows pretty thick where it gets {{the light at the}} edge of a wood." ...|$|E
5000|$|This is a rap about LL {{searching for}} a girl who is streetwise to form a {{relationship}} with. The entire song describes the exact features of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>looking</b> for in this particular girl. For example, he constantly repeats the line [...] "I need an around the way girl" [...] throughout the entire rap.|$|R
50|$|He packs {{a little}} bundle {{with his bare}} necessities, puts on his {{feathered}} hat and ventures out into woods of Brandenburg. When he discovers an old abandoned water tower {{in the middle of}} nowhere, he knows immediately that this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> for: his Ivory Tower, the ideal place to finally nail down his novel.|$|R
50|$|With Leonites, Amaro and {{his companions}} arrived at a natural harbor where they {{remained}} for a month, after which they traveled to an extensive and rugged valley, where Amaro will find <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> for: the Earthly Paradise. First, however, Amaro stumbled upon a nunnery situated high upon a mountaintop called Flor de Dueñas (Flower of Ladies).|$|R
6000|$|Clarence {{flung the}} boy a halfpenny, tore a paper from his grasp, and scanned it eagerly. There {{was nothing to}} {{interest}} him {{in the body of}} the journal, but he found <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> in the stop-press space. [...] "Stop press news," [...] said the paper. [...] "Fry not out, 104. Surrey 147 for 8. A German army landed in Essex this afternoon.

6000|$|Kipps {{sat on his}} tin box {{under the}} gas bracket that evening, and looked up the name Euphemia and learnt what it meant in the [...] "Enquire Within About Everything" [...] that {{constituted}} Buggins' reference library. He hoped Buggins, according to his habit, would ask him <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for,</b> but Buggins was busy turning out his week's washing. [...] "Two collars," [...] said Buggins, [...] "half pair socks, two dickeys. Shirt?... M'm. There ought to be another collar somewhere." ...|$|E
60|$|But no one {{tried to}} show her her mistake; and when she had ended her song Joe was very much moved.

6000|$|It was not {{upon the}} title, however, nor upon the {{illustration}} that Mr. Pett's fascinated eye rested. <b>What</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> at <b>was</b> a small reproduction of a photograph {{which had been}} inserted {{in the body of}} the article. It was the photograph of a woman in the early forties, rather formidably handsome, beneath which were printed the words: ...|$|R
5000|$|He joined Luton Town on loan {{shortly before}} the start of the 2008-09 season, but {{returned}} to Rovers early after manager Mick Harford felt <b>he</b> [...] "wasn't <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> for". In November 2008 Klein-Davies was loaned out again, this time to Newport County, and following the expiry of this deal he joined Lewes and then Bath City, again on loan.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then he {{goes out}} and heads toward the river, {{following}} his nose.

We go into a shanty and sit on high stools among stevedores and boatmen, and eat beans with tin spoons. Yes, sir, beans--beans boiled with salt pork.|$|R
60|$|He {{called for}} {{his coat and}} offered to take me there himself. He would {{have to return to}} the store at once {{for an hour or so}} to finish his business, and then he would be at liberty to talk over with me that matter of quarter-bags. This {{programme}} was breathed out at me through slightly parted, still lips; his heavy, motionless glance rested upon me, placid as ever, the glance of a tired man--but I felt that it was searching, too. I could not imagine <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> in me and kept silent, wondering.|$|E
60|$|Daylight {{travelled}} {{without a}} watch, feeling {{the passage of}} time and largely estimating it by subconscious processes. By what he considered must be six o'clock, he began looking for a camping-place. The trail, at a bend, plunged out across the river. Not having found a likely spot, they held on for the opposite bank a mile away. But midway they encountered an ice-jam which took an hour of heavy work to cross. At last Daylight glimpsed <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for,</b> a dead tree close by the bank. The sled was run in and up. Kama grunted with satisfaction, and the work of making camp was begun.|$|E
60|$|I {{felt the}} same. I {{picked up the}} candle and lit it, and then a most fearful thing happened. The old man picked himself up, and {{suddenly}} collapsed into a chair {{and began to cry}} like a child. Of course, I could see it was only the Artistic Temperament, but still, believe me, it was devilish unpleasant. I looked at old Bill. Old Bill looked at me. We shut the door quick, and after that we didn't know what to do. I saw Bill look at the sideboard, and I knew <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for.</b> But we had taken the siphon upstairs, and his ideas of first-aid stopped short at squirting soda-water. We just waited, and presently old Yeardsley switched off, sat up, and began talking with a rush.|$|E
50|$|When <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{asked by}} Renders {{to restore the}} Madonna, Van der Veken {{endeavored}} to reconstruct all that had been irretrievably lost and damaged. He used his very 'radical' hyperrestoration method. His intervention still determines the present condition of the painting {{and there is no}} visible aging. The 'restoration' cannot be detected with the naked eye by a trained observer who knows <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>looking</b> for.|$|R
50|$|By February 2017, Warner Bros. was {{developing}} a film centered on Dick Grayson / Nightwing, with Chris McKay and Bill Dubuque {{signed on as}} director and screenwriter respectively.

60|$|Lady Lydiard's {{self-control}} failed her for {{the first}} time. Isabel's courage had made Isabel dearer to her than ever. She sank into a chair, and covered her face with her handkerchief. Mr. Troy turned aside abruptly, and examined a Japanese vase, without any idea in his mind of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> at. Lady Lydiard had gravely misjudged him in believing him to be a heartless man.|$|R
