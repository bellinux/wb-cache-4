5|$|A {{few months}} later, in June 1919, the American Federation of Labor (AFL), {{responding}} to repeated requests from local police organizations, began accepting police organizations into their membership. By September, it had granted charters to police unions in 37 cities, including Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Miami, and St. Paul, though not without protests from some city officials, <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> the unionization of police, firefighters, and teachers.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of peace, Tantallon again saw {{military}} action during the Bishops' Wars in 1639. The Douglas family had remained Catholic after the Scottish Reformation, incurring {{the wrath of the}} Presbyterian Covenanters, <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> Charles I's attempts to interfere with the Scottish Church. In 1639, the Covenanters captured Tantallon while William, newly created Marquess of Douglas, was in Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the scale}} of the phase 3 {{reclamation}} in Central was cut back from 32 to 18 hectares, the fate of the piers was sealed by the reclamation. The pier became the centre of a bitter struggle between the Government and conservationists, <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> either further destruction of the harbour or the further loss of historical buildings.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{controversy}} surrounding his consecration, Bishop Robinson was not invited to the 2008 Lambeth Conferences by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams. A group of conservative bishops (including Akinola and Duncan) <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> Robinson's consecration gathered in Jerusalem one month prior to Lambeth 2008, at the Global Anglican Future Conference, an event which is perceived by some as schismatic.|$|E

5|$|In 1024, because Maymandi {{had gained}} {{a great amount}} of wealth during his career as a vizier, Mahmud removed him from his office, confiscated his property, and had him imprisoned at Kalinjar in India.

5|$|In 1895, Maryland Agricultural, a land-grant {{school with}} a {{military}} curriculum requirement, had a new commandant of cadets take office. Lieutenant Clough Overton, <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> football at the university, cut funding for equipment and instituted strict rules limiting practice time. Instead of accepting this serious disadvantage against their opponents, the players declined to field a football team for the season.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, after Hastert had {{departed}} from Congress, the highway project was killed after federal regulators retracted the 2008 approval {{of an environmental}} impact statement for the project and agreed to an Illinois Department of Transportation request to redirect the funds for other projects.

5|$|Morton also {{believed}} that war was inevitable and began to prepare the state for its outbreak during his early tenure as governor.

5|$|Once more {{in nearly}} a two to one margin, the gay rights {{ordinance}} was defeated in Eugene. A poll taken after the vote showed that liberal voters who were not gay simply declined {{to show up and}} vote, and those <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> the ordinance were much more motivated.|$|E

5|$|The Ba'ath Party faced a major dilemma: take {{power through}} {{competitive}} elections or through forceful takeover. Even the liberal and democratic-inclined founding leaders were partial to forceful takeover, citing the corrupt electoral process. Before taking power, the Ba'ath Party gambled {{that it would}} be allowed to share power with Gamal Abdel Nasser in the United Arab Republic (UAR). The UAR would prove to be Egypt-dominated, and the Ba'ath Party was forced to dissolve itself, but in 1961 the UAR collapsed because of a military coup in Syria. The establishment and the dissolution of the UAR was a catastrophe for the Ba'ath Party as it divided among those who supported the UAR, those <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> it and those <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> or supported the traditional leaders of the party. In 1962, Aflaq convened a Ba'ath Party congress and re-established the party. Several branches had not followed orders and had not dissolved during the UAR years. Instead they had become deeply hostile to pan-Arabist thought and had become radical socialists instead. The military committee, which would launch the 8 March Revolution, shared most of their views.|$|E
5|$|The Libyan anti-Gaddafist {{movement}} {{brought together}} a {{diverse array of}} groups, which had varied motives and objectives.

5|$|The Spanish anarcho-syndicalists, <b>who</b> <b>opposed</b> the war out of doctrinaire {{cynicism and}} a belief that neither faction were on the workers' side, angrily repudiated their former idols (including Kropotkin, Malato and Grave) after {{discovering}} they had authored the manifesto.
