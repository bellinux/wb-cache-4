2500|$|... c) Janus's cultic {{alliances and}} {{relations}} in Latium would show a Prelatin character. Janus has no association in cult (calendar or prayer formulae) {{with any other}} entity. Even though he bears the epithet of Pater he is no head of a divine family; however some testimonies lend him a companion, sometimes female, and a son and/or a daughter. They belong {{to the family of}} the nymphs or genies of springs. Janus intervenes in the miracle of the hot spring during the battle between Romulus and Tatius: Juturna and the nymphs of the springs are clearly related to Janus as well as Venus, that in Ovid's Metamorphoses cooperates in the miracle and may have been confused with Venilia, or perhaps the two might have been originally one. Janus has a direct link only to Venilia, with whom he fathered Canens. The magic role of the <b>wild</b> <b>olive</b> <b>tree</b> (oleaster) is prominent in the description of the duel between Aeneas and Turnus reflecting its religious significance and powers: it was sacred to sailors, also those who had shipwrecked as a protecting guide to the shore. It was probably venerated by a Prelatin culture in association with Faunus. In the story of Venulus coming back from Apulia too one may see the religious connotation of the wild olive: the king discovers one into which a local shepherd had been turned for failing to respect the nymphs he had come across in a nearby cavern, apparently Venilia, who was the deity associated with the magic virtues of such tree. Gagé finds it remarkable that the characters related to Janus are in the Aeneis {{on the side of the}} Rutuli. In the poem Janus would be represented by Tiberinus. Olistene, the daughter of Janus with Camese, may reflect in her name that of the olive or oleaster, or of Oreithyia. Camese may be reflected in Carmenta: Evander's mother is from Arcadia, comes to Latium as an exile migrant and has her two festivals in January: Camese's name at any rate does not look Latin.|$|E

But there was another side to the case; and whether the strange gentleman were a <b>wild</b> <b>olive</b> <b>tree,</b> or not, it was questionable if the acquaintance would lead to happiness. 'A fleeting romance and a possible calamity;' thus it might have been summed up by the practical.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are some}} {{different}} {{opinions about the}} town's name.

6000|$|But still, every {{expression}} of the pleasure which Ulysses has in this landing and resting, contains uninterruptedly the reference to the utility and sensible pleasantness of all things, not to their beauty. After his first grateful kiss given to the corn-growing land, he considers immediately how he is to pass the night; for some minutes hesitating {{whether it will be}} best to expose himself to the misty chill from the river, or run the risk of wild beasts in the wood. He decides for the wood, and finds in it a bower formed by a sweet and a <b>wild</b> <b>olive</b> <b>tree,</b> interlacing their branches, or--perhaps more accurately translating Homer's intensely graphic expression--"changing their branches with each other" [...] (it is very curious how often, in an entanglement of wood, one supposes the branches to belong to the wrong trees) and forming a roof penetrated by neither rain, sun, nor wind. Under this bower Ulysses collects the [...] "vain (or frustrate) outpouring of the dead leaves"--another exquisite expression, used elsewhere of useless grief or shedding of tears;--and, having got enough together, makes his bed of them, and goes to sleep, having covered himself up with them, [...] "as embers are covered up with ashes."[104] ...|$|E
60|$|Eighth. Man, as {{he comes}} into the world, {{is not only a}} dead man, a fool, proud, self-willed, fearless, a false believer, and a lover of sin, but a wild man. He is of the <b>wild</b> <b>olive</b> <b>tree,</b> of that which is wild by nature (Rom 11:17,24). So, in another place, man by nature is {{compared}} to the ass, to a wild ass. 'For vain or empty man would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt' (Job 11:12). Isaac was a figure of Christ, and of all converted men (Gen 4:28). But Ishmael was a figure of man by nature; and the Holy Ghost, as to that, saith this of him, 'And he will be a wild man' (Gen 16:12). This man, I say, was a figure of all carnal men, in their wildness or estrangedness from God. Hence it is said of the prodigal, at his conversion, that he came to himself then; implying that he was mad, wild, or out of his wits before (Luke 15:17). I know there is a difference sometimes betwixt one's being wild and mad; yet sometimes wildness arriveth to that degree as to give one rightly the denomination of being mad. And it is always true in spirituals; namely, that he that is wild, as to God, is mad, or besides himself, and so not capable, before he is tamed, of minding his own eternal good as he should. There are these several things that are tokens of one wild or mad; and they all meet in a carnal man.|$|E
60|$|But again, As by {{the names}} of the twelve tribes written on the gates, we may see what {{encouragement}} the Jews will have, at their return, to enter in at them; so we may also understand that by {{the names of}} the twelve tribes here written, God would have us to perceive how all must be qualified that from among the Gentiles at this day do enter in at these gates; namely, those, and those only, that be cut out of their own <b>wild</b> <b>olive</b> <b>tree,</b> and transplanted among the children of Israel, into their good olive tree. Such as are Jews inwardly, the Israel of God, according to the new creature, they shall enter, for the holy Gentiles also, by virtue of their conversion, are styled the children of Abraham, Jews, the chosen generation, the peculiar people, the holy nation; and so are spiritually, though not naturally by carnal generation, of the twelve tribes whose names are written upon the gates of the city (Gal 3:7; Rom 2:28; 1 Peter 2:9,10). 'And it shall come to pass,' saith the prophet, 'that in what tribe the stranger,' that is, the Gentile 'sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the Lord God' (Eze 47:23). Thus the Jews and Gentiles shall meet together {{in the spirit of the}} gospel, and so both become a righteous nation; to both which the gates of this city shall stand continually open; at which also they may with boldness demand, by the faith of the Lord Jesus, their entrance, both for communion with the God, grace, and privileges of this city, according to that which is written, 'Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in' (Isa 26:2). Thus much of the number of the gates, and now to proceed to the order of them.|$|E

50|$|Lastly, anybody {{seeking to}} try frappelia as a remedy or health {{supplement}} should {{ensure that they}} take proper care and observe reasonable standards {{when it comes to}} consumption of olive leaf frappe. Make sure to use properly cleaned leaves preferably picked from <b>wild</b> <b>olive</b> <b>trees.</b> <b>Olive</b> <b>trees</b> can be found everywhere in Greece (and many other Mediterranean countries), but many of them are being actively cultivated and as a consequence are regularly sprayed with pesticides and fertilizers.

40|$|A {{population}} of Xiphinema barense from <b>wild</b> <b>olive</b> <b>trees</b> in Torre Pozzella, Brindisi province, southern Italy, is described using both morphological and molecular studies and {{compared with the}} description of the type specimens. The <b>wild</b> <b>olive</b> nematode population agrees very well with all morphometrics provided in the original description. However, detailed observations of the lumen of the tubular portion of the uterus in paratypes and specimens of the new population revealed a clear pseudo-Z-organ with small granules mixed with crystalloid bodies which were previously undetected. Photomicrographs of adult paratypes, which were lacking in the original description, and of specimens of the new population from <b>wild</b> <b>olive</b> <b>trees</b> are provided. The results of the phylogenetic analyses based on the sequences of the D 2 -D 3 expansion regions of the 28 S rRNA gene and ITS rRNA genes confirm the species differentiation and indicate the phylogenetic position of X. barense and its relationship with closely related species.
