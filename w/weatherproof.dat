5|$|Copper {{has been}} used since ancient times as a durable, {{corrosion}} resistant, and <b>weatherproof</b> architectural material. Roofs, flashings, rain gutters, downspouts, domes, spires, vaults, and doors have been made from copper for {{hundreds or thousands of}} years. Copper's architectural use has been expanded in modern times to include interior and exterior wall cladding, building expansion joints, radio frequency shielding, and antimicrobial and decorative indoor products such as attractive handrails, bathroom fixtures, and counter tops. Some of copper's other important benefits as an architectural material include low thermal movement, light weight, lightning protection, and recyclability.|$|E
5|$|Building {{materials}} vary greatly. Brick {{was rarely}} {{used at the}} time Round Hill was developing (although a few houses in Belton Road were built of it); bungaroosh was often used for walls instead. Characteristic of Brighton but almost unknown elsewhere, this consisted of random assortments of materials such as low-quality brick, cobbles, flints, pebbles, rubble, wood and sand, set in hydraulic lime and shuttered. Bungaroosh was often faced with render or stucco to make it <b>weatherproof.</b> Some flint buildings survive on Prince's Crescent. When built, most windows in the conservation area's houses were sashes, and roofs were of Welsh slate.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to a lack}} of maintenance, the {{protective}} lacquer covering Knife Edge Two Piece degraded and exposed the surface of the sculpture to the elements. This resulted in oxidation of the bronze metal. Subsequent deterioration of the patination and years of graffiti scratched into the surface resulted in further corrosion. The conservation aimed to remove the remaining protective lacquer and surface dirt, and to remove the result of corrosion and oxidation from the sculpture, and take the surface back to the bare metal. Following the removal of graffiti the sculpture was repatinated to return it to its original colour. It was finally waxed with a <b>weatherproof</b> surface to protect it from future damage. The conservation work was undertaken by Rupert Harris Conservation, working in consultation with the Henry Moore Foundation. The cost of the conservation was £16,190, with £11,000 contributed by the Henry Moore Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Medieval vernacular {{architecture}} in rural environments {{made use of}} local materials and styles. As in England, cruck construction was used, employing pairs of curved timbers to support the roof; however they were usually hidden from view. In rural areas there was extensive use of turf {{to fill in the}} walls, sometimes on a stone base, but they were not long lasting and had to be rebuilt frequently, perhaps as often as every two or three years. In some regions, including the south-west and around Dundee, solid clay walls were used, or combinations of clay, turf and straw, rendered with clay or lime to make them <b>weatherproof.</b> With a lack of long span structural timber, the most common building material was stone, employed in both mortared and dry stone construction. Different regions used broom, heather, straw, turfs or reeds for roofing.|$|E
5|$|The main {{speakers}} may be 'flown' {{from the}} ceiling of a venue on chain hoists, and 'flying points' (i.e., attachment points) are built into many professional loudspeaker enclosures. Subwoofers can be flown or stacked on the ground near the stage. There can be more than 50 double-18-inch (45cm) cabinets in a typical concert system. Just as consumer subwoofer enclosures can be made of Medium-density fibreboard (MDF), Oriented strand board (OSB), plywood, plastic or other dense material, professional subwoofer enclosures can be built from the same materials. MDF is commonly used to construct subwoofers for permanent installations as its density is relatively high and weatherproofing is not a concern. Other permanent installation subwoofers have used very thick plywood: the Altec 8182 (1981) used 7-ply 28mm birch-faced oak plywood. Touring subwoofers are typically built from 18–20mm thick void-free Baltic birch (Betula pendula or Betula pubescens) plywood from Finland, Estonia or Russia; such plywood affords greater strength for frequently transported enclosures. Not naturally <b>weatherproof,</b> Baltic birch is coated with carpet, thick paint or spray-on truck bedliner to give the subwoofer enclosures greater durability.|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonic {{detectors}} {{are powerful}} tools {{for the study}} of bat ecology. Many options are available for deploying acoustic detectors including various <b>weatherproofing</b> designs and microphone orientations, but the impacts of these options on {{the quantity and quality of}} the bat calls that are recorded are unknown. We compared the impacts of three microphone orientations (horizontal, 45 u, and vertical) and two <b>weatherproofing</b> designs (polyvinyl chloride tubes and the BatHat) on the number of calls detected, call quality, and species detected by the Anabat II bat detector system at 17 sites in central Kentucky in May and June 2008. Detectors with BatHat <b>weatherproofing</b> recorded significantly fewer call sequences, pulses per file, species per site, and lower quality calls. Detectors in the horizontal position also tended to record fewer files, fewer species, and lower quality calls. These results illustrate potential impacts of deployment method on quality and quantity of data obtained. Because <b>weatherproofing</b> and orientation impacted the quality and quantity of data recorded, comparison of results using different methodologies should be made with caution...|$|R

5|$|The vernacular {{architecture}} of Scotland, as elsewhere, {{made use of}} local materials and methods. The homes of the poor were usually of very simple construction, and were built by groups of family and friends. Stone is plentiful throughout Scotland and was a common building material, employed in both mortared and dry stone construction. As in English {{vernacular architecture}}, where wood was available, crucks (pairs of curved timbers) were often used to support the roof. With a lack of long span structural timber, the crucks were sometimes raised and supported on the walls. Walls were often built of stone, and could have gaps filled with turf, or plastered with clay. In some regions wattled walls filled in with turf were employed, sometimes on a stone base. Turf-filled walls were not long-lasting, {{and had to be}} rebuilt perhaps as often as every two or three years. In some regions, including the south-west and around Dundee, solid clay walls were used, or combinations of clay, turf and straw, rendered with clay or lime to make them <b>weatherproof.</b> Different regions used turfs, or thatch of broom, heather, straw or reeds for roofing.|$|E

25|$|Kiln roofs, {{where the}} kiln was external, were {{generally}} built of a timber frame {{and covered in}} either peg tiles or slate. Some oasts had conical kiln roofs built of brick, these were covered in tar or pitch to keep them <b>weatherproof.</b> A few oasts had square kilns with brick roofs, again covered in tar or pitch. The top of the roof was open, and carried a cowl or louvred vent.|$|E

50|$|Rigid {{removable}} hardtops, many {{of which}} store in a car's trunk, have been around {{at least since the}} 1950s. These normally provide superior <b>weatherproofing,</b> soundproofing, and durability compared to fabric-based tops, some with integrated rear-window defrosters and windscreens. Examples include the first- and 11th-generation Ford Thunderbird, second- and third-generation Mercedes SL, Porsche Boxster, Jeep Wrangler, and Mazda MX-5. Many of the rigidity concerns of a standard convertible are present, even with the roof attached, although {{in the case of the}} early Daimler SP250s, the hardtop does give some extra rigidity. However, <b>weatherproofing,</b> climate control, and cabin security are improved.|$|R

25|$|About 1760, O'Higgins {{enrolled}} in the Spanish Imperial Service as draughtsman and then engineer. He was directly responsible {{for the establishment of}} a reliable postal service between La Plata colony and the General Captaincy of Chile. On his first harrowing journey over the Andes mountains separating Argentina and Chile during the winter of 1763–64, O'Higgins conceived the idea of a chain of <b>weatherproof</b> shelters. By 1766, thanks to O'Higgins' efficient execution of this plan, Chile enjoyed all-year overland postal service with Argentina, which had previously been cut off for several months each winter.|$|E

25|$|The trabucco {{is built}} with {{traditional}} wood Aleppo pine -the typical pine of Gargano and common throughout the South-Western Adriatic- because {{this material is}} virtually limitless (for his dissemination in the area) modeled, elastic, <b>weatherproof</b> and resistant to salt (trabucco must resist to strong Mistral usually blowing in these areas). Some trabucchi have been rebuilt in recent years, thanks to public funds. However, since they lost their economic function in the past centuries when they were the main economical source of entire families of fishermen, trabucchi rose {{into the role of}} cultural and architectural symbols and tourist attraction.|$|E
25|$|Between his {{sessions}} at Harvard, Fuller worked in Canada as a mechanic in a textile mill, {{and later as}} a laborer in the meat-packing industry. He also served in the U.S. Navy in World War I, as a shipboard radio operator, as an editor of a publication, and as a crash rescue boat commander. After discharge, he worked again in the meat packing industry, acquiring management experience. In 1917, he married Anne Hewlett. During the early 1920s, he and his father-in-law developed the Stockade Building System for producing light-weight, <b>weatherproof,</b> and fireproof housing—although the company would ultimately fail in 1927.|$|E
25|$|Because of the 3M phaseout, in 2002 DuPont {{built its}} own plant in Fayetteville, NC to {{manufacture}} the chemical. The chemical has received attention due to litigation from the PFOA-contaminated community around DuPont's Washington Works Washington, WV facility, along with USEPA focus. Research on PFOA has demonstrated ubiquity, animal-based toxicity, and some associations with human health parameters and potential health effects. Additionally, advances in analytical chemistry {{in recent years}} have allowed the routine detection of low- and sub-parts per billion levels of PFOA in a variety of substances. In 2013, Gore-Tex eliminated the use of PFOAs in the manufacture of its <b>weatherproof</b> functional fabrics.|$|E
