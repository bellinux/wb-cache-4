40|$|The telecom {{network in}} India {{is the fifth}} largest network in the world meeting up with global standards. Presently, the Indian telecom {{industry}} is currently slated to an estimated contribution of nearly 1 % to India's GDP. The Indian Telecommunications network with 110. 01 million connections is the fifth {{largest in the world}} and the second largest among the emerging economies of Asia. Today, it is the fastest growing market in the world and represents unique opportunities for U. S. companies in the stagnant global scenario. The total subscriber base, which has grown by 40 % in 2005, is expected to reach 250 million in 2007. According to Broadband Policy 2004, Government of India aims at 9 million broadband connections and 18 million internet connections by 2007. The <b>wireless</b> <b>subscriber</b> base has jumped from 33. 69 million in 2004 to 62. 57 million in FY 2004 - 2005. In the last 3 years, two out of every three new telephone subscribers were wireless subscribers. Consequently, wireless now accounts for 54. 6 % of the total telephone subscriber base, as compared to only 40 % in 2003. <b>Wireless</b> <b>subscriber</b> growth is expected to bypass 2. 5 million new subscribers per month by 2007.

40|$|Abstract—Fine-grained dynamic {{population}} estimation {{is in an}} increasingly high demand as it has numerous applications in wireless network engineering, urban planning, location-based services and mobile applications, and advertisement. In this paper, we introduce a framework that dynamically estimates the <b>wireless</b> <b>subscriber</b> population of an arbitrary fine-grained area based on the current cellular phone usage. This framework takes advantage of strong regularities, low variance, and low information entropy in human mobility and phone usage patterns; thus simplifying the estimation for wireless carriers and other big entities while maintaining a high accuracy. We implemented our ‘regularity-based ’ framework using empirical data. Comparison with experimentally collected data shows a significant improvement in the accuracy of population estimation compared to population count based on cellular phone usage.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the technologies and applications {{associated with the}} extension of the connection between a wireless radio base station and its antennas. The extension of this connection allows wireless operators to provide wireless service to new and remote areas, using radio equipment from an existing location.

The cost benefits of using today’s technologies to extend the link between radio base stations and their antennas is also examined. Executive Summary The wireless telecommunications industry has experienced enormous growth over the last few years, driven primarily by <b>wireless</b> <b>subscriber</b> growth and most recently the promise of wireless data services. The demand for wireless services continues to grow throughout the world. At this point, global wireless telecommunications subscriber growth is about 20 % annually. As the deman...|$|E
40|$|One {{issue in}} giving WIRELESS LOCAL LOOP {{connections}} {{in a rural}} area is the difficulty of conducting field trials due to poor road conditions and the hilly terrain in Sri Lanka. Extremely poor condition of access roads reduces the efficiency of giving new <b>wireless</b> <b>subscriber</b> connections. Even though at the installation of a base station, the coverage area is defined (around 20 Km radius from base station) due to the hilly and mountainous terrain in Sri Lanka signal strength varies drastically for about 100 m change of distance. There are number of Radio network planning tools or Wireless calculators in the industry with real time corrections like body losses, penetration losses and thermal noise density. But when we apply those in Sri Lankan context, we do not get the correct coverage diagrams. Therefore we propose two new path loss exponents which is suitable for countries like Sri Lanka where the population spread in hills and mountains...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Wireless {{carriers}} have various churn {{models that}} are mainly based on profiling the customers and assigning churn probabilities to them. Profiling is usually limited to their individual data, {{such as their}} subscription history, demographics, usage, etc. However, our analysis of a major wireless carrier data shows that such churn prediction methods do not fully model <b>wireless</b> <b>subscriber</b> churn, and that the subscribers can be influenced by other subscribers ’ churn in their social network. We propose a novel method to identify ‘churn influencers’, whose influence makes their social contacts churn subsequently. To build our model, we scored the subscribers ’ influence level {{in a way that}} can take current churn models into account. We further used large scale call records to identify social network and communication features that abstract the strong influencers. Using real world churn data, we trained classification tools to classify high influencers with up to ninety nine percent precision. Keywords-Wireless Subscribers, Churn, Influence prediction I...|$|E

40|$|Broadband {{wireless}} access {{is the most}} challenging segment of the wireless revolution since it has to demonstrate {{a viable alternative to}} the cable modem and DSL technologies that are strongly entrenched in the last mile access environment. The Analysis, Research, and Consultancy (ARC) Group forecasts that the fixed wireless deployments in both homes and businesses will reach almost 28 million by 2005, with North America and Western Europe accounting for 24 percent and 27 percent of these, respectively. Whether the promise of BWA will materialize depends on its appeal to telecom operators from the perspective of deployment economics, where the critical factor is the ease of installation of broadband <b>wireless</b> <b>subscriber</b> units. This ultimately leads to nonprofessional installation of integrated all-indoor BWSUs. Consequently the physical layer (PHY) has to mitigate the very tough impairments that characterize these nonline-of-sight environments.

40|$|Prior {{research}} suggests that <b>wireless</b> <b>subscribers</b> often overpay for their services due to subscription of rate plans that are not financially optimized. Some wireless carriers have responded by introducing {{a new type of}} plan called "Flex", which gives subscribers the best service rate based on their actual usage. In Canada, this kind of cost-minimizing plan is only available for 3 G data service. Should it be extended to customers who are using the "bread-and-butter" voice service? To what extent do they select inappropriate rate plans? This paper explores these issues by analysing subscribers' rate plan suitability with a focus on their revenue implications. Based on a 44 -month study of 8146 postpaid <b>wireless</b> <b>subscribers,</b> this paper reveals that optimal rate plan subscribers contribute approximately 50 % less revenue than those with non-optimal plans. Wireless carriers should be prepared to sacrifice the short-term revenue in exchange of loyalty by having subscribers on financially optimized plans.
