5|$|The King {{traveled}} with no security guards; {{only a small}} group of personal friends made the journey with him. Except for land transportation in cities, and two loaned ships in China and the US, his modes of transportation were seldom reserved exclusively for him. He shared regularly scheduled steamships and rail transport with fare-paying passengers. On the Red Sea, he played cards and danced with other passengers. Like other tourists, he visited the white elephants of Siam, the Giza pyramid complex in Egypt, tourist sites in India, and museums in Europe. Along the way, he exceeded his original budget, <b>went</b> <b>shopping</b> anyway, and sent letters back home.|$|E

The experience of art is not exciting and ennobling—at best it is puzzling and mostly leaves one {{with a sense of}} distaste. But over and above that, Duchamp did not select just any ready-made object to display. In selecting the urinal, his message was clear: Art is something you piss on.|$|E
25|$|Loos and Emerson {{turned down}} another picture with Davies, preferring {{to write for}} their old friend Constance Talmadge, whose {{brother-in-law}} Joseph Schenck (husband of Norma Talmadge) was an independent producer. Both A Temperamental Wife (1919) and A Virtuous Vamp (1919) were great hits for Talmadge. The Schenck studios filmed in a New York warehouse, and Loos and Emerson occupied suites at the Algonquin. Individually Anita liked {{many members of the}} Algonquin Round Table, but as a group she found them overwhelming. In the spring of 1919, the couple joined the Talmadges and the Schencks at the Ambassador Hotel on Park Avenue, with Constance, filling the void left by the loss of her sister many years before. When Anita and Constance weren't working, they <b>went</b> <b>shopping.</b> The Talmadge-Schencks convinced Anita to summer with them in Paris without Emerson. Much of this adventure would end up as fodder for Loos's book Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.|$|E

25|$|The Daily Telegraph, citing {{anonymous}} sources, {{reported that}} in December 2006, a top Syrian official (according to one article this {{was the head of}} the Atomic Energy Commission of Syria, Ibrahim Othman) arrived in London under a false name. The Mossad had detected a booking for the official in a London hotel, and dispatched at least ten undercover agents to London. The agents were split into three teams. One group was sent to Heathrow Airport to identify the official as he arrived, a second to book into his hotel, and a third to monitor his movements and visitors. Some of the operatives were from the Kidon Division, which specializes in assassinations, and the Neviot Division, which specializes in breaking into homes, embassies, and hotel rooms to install bugging devices. On the first day of his visit, he visited the Syrian embassy and then <b>went</b> <b>shopping.</b> Kidon operatives closely followed him, while Neviot operatives broke into his hotel room and found his laptop. A computer expert then installed software that allowed the Mossad to monitor his activities on the computer. When the computer material was examined at Mossad headquarters, officials found blueprints and hundreds of pictures of the Kibar facility in various stages of construction, and correspondence. One photograph showed North Korean nuclear official Chon Chibu meeting with Ibrahim Othman, Syria's atomic energy agency director. Though the Mossad had originally planned to kill the official in London, it was decided to spare his life following the discovery. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was notified. The following month, Olmert formed a three-member panel to report on Syria's nuclear program. The CIA was also informed and the American intelligence network joined the quest for more information. Six months later, Brigadier-General Yaakov Amidror, one of the panel's members, informed Olmert that Syria was working with North Korea and Iran on a nuclear facility. Iran had funneled $1 billion to the project, and planned on using the Kibar facility to replace Iranian facilities if Iran was unable to complete its uranium enrichment program.|$|E

The group met again on 16 April for what police allege was a final briefing, before meeting for their final time at the airport before their 17 April arrest. After receiving information from the AFP about the group, including the names, passport numbers and information relating to their links to possible illegal drug trade, Indonesian police placed the group under constant surveillance for a week before their arrest.|$|E
500|$|Eleanor and LeHand {{remained}} on good terms. Eleanor Roosevelt biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook describes the First Lady as treating LeHand warmly, [...] "as an elder daughter or, {{in the manner}} of Asian matriarchs, as the junior wife". The two women <b>went</b> <b>shopping</b> together, and Eleanor took a solicitous interest in LeHand's smoking and general health. Eleanor also accompanied LeHand to her mother's funeral in Potsdam during the first presidential campaign in 1932, helping the family make arrangements. Elliott later stated that he believed [...] "Missy alleviated Mother's guilt", allowing her to travel without worrying that Franklin would lack for companionship. In one of her later books, Eleanor wrote that she occasionally failed to [...] "meet the need of someone whom I dearly love", stating, [...] "You must learn to allow someone else to meet the need, without bitterness or envy, and accept it." [...] Cook reads these passages as veiled references to LeHand's role in Franklin's life, and Eleanor's acceptance of that role.|$|E

500|$|Quintanilla, Jr. {{sought to}} {{maintain}} Selena's image clean and family-oriented. In 1989, she was offered sponsorship from beer companies {{but her father}} turned them down. Selena was often refused gigs at Tejano venues {{because she was a}} female singer in a male-dominated music scene. Manuel Peña wrote that after 1989, Selena's popularity increased and she became a sex icon following the release of her debut album. Charles Tatum said Selena drew most attention from her [...] "beauty, sexuality, and youthful impact on the Tejano music scene". Selena said she never wanted to record explicit songs because of her upbringing and because her fan base consisted largely of young children, who regarded her as a role model. She further commented on the question of her sexual appeal to men during her crossover attempt, asserting that she will [...] "stay the same" [...] and that her English-language recordings will refrain from foul language and sexual themes. In 1997, María Celeste Arrarás wrote in her book about Selena's death that the singer was a [...] "sweet and charismatic girl". According to Arrarás, Selena [...] "trusted everyone"; she often <b>went</b> <b>shopping</b> alone, despite her father's concerns over her safety.|$|E

The first stop was Azerbaijan on March 22, 2008, where she made guest appearances on many major television and radio programs; staying until March 26. On March 27, Kalomoira arrived in Romania for a three-day stay, where she again appeared on television and gave interviews. After a brief break, she traveled to Turkey, arriving on April 10, where she posed for pictures, gave interviews to the local media, and <b>went</b> <b>shopping</b> through the Grand Bazaar along with Turkish media. She also met with Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople, who wished her success and presented her with a medallion. By April 17, Kalomoira had reached Bosnia and Herzegovina; in addition to hosting a show on PINK TV, she appeared on television shows, gave many interviews, and met with Elvir Laković Laka and his sister Mirella, Bosnia and Herzegovina's entrants in the contest. Kalomoira then went to Belgrade, Serbia, where she was a guest star on a morning television show, performed [...] "Secret Combination" [...] live on Radio Television of Serbia, and had an interview with FOX TV.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, New Zealand's {{national}} network was expanding {{at a great}} rate and demand for services on existing lines was rising. [...] However, {{the size of the}} locomotive fleet was inadequate to handle the demand - this was at least in part due to the economic difficulties created by the Long Depression. [...] The New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) had built the WA class in its own workshops, but desperate for more engines, <b>went</b> <b>shopping</b> overseas for more. [...] High prices and workers' strikes in England meant that the Baldwin Locomotive Works of Pennsylvania was contacted in 1898 to provide twelve locomotives built to similar specifications as the WA class. [...] Delivery was swift and the locomotives entered service between January and May 1899. [...] Although initially classified as WA, they were re-classified WB in 1900-01 to avoid any confusion with the earlier locomotives constructed in New Zealand.|$|E

Then, I decided that I would flee to Osaka, staying with Ishida's penis all the while. In the end, I would jump from a cliff on Mount Ikoma while holding on to his penis." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{children}} {{returned to}} Jackson's Neverland ranch {{and a day}} later their mother joined them after resuming preparations {{for the trip to}} Brazil—although, she would later testify, she did not really want to go. From February 25 to March 2 the family, along with some of Jackson's staff, stayed in a hotel in Calabasas, California, and <b>went</b> <b>shopping</b> in preparation for the trip to Brazil. After that, the family stayed at Neverland again. On March 10, the mother and the accuser drove from Neverland to Kaiser Permanente Hospital with a urine sample of the accuser, Gavin, for a scheduled medical check-up. On the way to the hospital, Janet spilled the urine sample on the passenger-side floor of the car. [...] When asked by a Jackson employee what happened, Janet said that she spilled the urine accidentally. [...] At the hospital, Gavin received numerous tests for his kidney, including a dye test. [...] The urine sample, however, was insufficient for one of the tests, and it came back inconclusive. Afterward, the accuser returned to Neverland, while the mother went to stay with her fiance. It would be the boys' last stay at the Neverland ranch. Apparently, the accuser was very angry with his mother that she would not allow him to return.|$|E
