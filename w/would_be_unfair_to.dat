5|$|Whether a {{timeframe}} {{should be}} imposed for the calling of by-elections has {{been subject to}} much debate. Several arguments have been advanced by the Government. First, when a voter casts a vote for a candidate, he is also voting for the political party that the candidate is a member of. Thus, once the party has received the voter's mandate, a vacant seat will not affect this mandate. Requiring the other members in a GRC to vacate their seats so that a by-election can be called <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> them. Secondly, the Government believes that a GRC can function if it is lacking a member, as MPs from other constituencies can help {{to address the needs}} of residents in that GRC.|$|E
25|$|Courts have {{jurisdiction}} to prevent abuses of process if it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> try a defendant or {{a fair trial}} would not be possible.|$|E

50|$|The closure was {{subsequently}} brought forward {{and the channel}} closed down on Friday 23 December 2005 at 18:00 (GMT). The reason given <b>was</b> that it <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> expect the channel's staff to work long hours over Christmas knowing that the channel <b>would</b> soon <b>be</b> closing.|$|R
25|$|Police {{disciplinary}} {{charges were}} abandoned when Duckenfield retired on health grounds and, {{because he was}} unavailable, it was decided it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> proceed with disciplinary charges against Bernard Murray. Duckenfield took medical retirement on a full police pension.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Guste {{announced}} that his office {{would no longer}} enforce blue laws after a federal judge, Charles Schwartz of New Orleans, ruled that three particular department stores could open on Sundays. Guste said that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> give some businesses an advantage over their competitors by allowing only those given court permission to open on Sunday.|$|E
25|$|Failure to enjoin the unconstitutional statute {{would require}} the person subject to a {{potential}} violation to either pay the increased rate or face the threat of prosecution. Therefore, the Court determined that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> require challengers of a law to wait until they faced a harsh sanction before they could bring any kind of action questioning the validity of that law. The Court also noted that, although {{a number of cases}} had held that the state itself could not be sued, those cases did not prohibit enjoining a state official, as an individual, from carrying out some task on behalf of the state.|$|E
5000|$|The {{developer}} {{decided to}} start creating the game after complaining across several game developer forums about the [...] "extreme hand-holding of the player" [...] in current generation games and as such {{he set out to}} create a game that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> brutally <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> the player.|$|R

25|$|Constantia's {{poems are}} few and far between, yet the ones still in {{circulation}} are seen as proof of her intelligence. Many poems, epigrams, and occasional pieces flowed from her facile pen—written in Latin, Greek, or English; but as they did not come up to her standard of excellence, she burnt them all before her death. None of her poems have been preserved, save a few which she addressed to various friends, notably to Mrs. Barber, and which are too personal to be quoted as they could not possess any interest for the general reader; and, on the other hand, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> give them as specimens of Mrs. Grierson's poetical abilities.|$|E
25|$|Wilson was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the June 1915 King's Birthday Honours, {{having been}} {{passed over for}} the honour in February. He was invited to speak at a Cabinet meeting in summer 1915. In the summer of 1915 Wilson {{believed}} that the French government might fall, or France herself seek peace, unless the British committed to the mooted Loos offensive. He declined French’s offer of a corps command (20 August) claiming it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> divisional commanders who deserved promotion. His efforts {{to be the main}} go-between of French and Joffre ended in September 1915, when it was decided that these contacts should go through Sidney Clive, the British liaison officer at GQG.|$|E
25|$|Several design {{elements}} {{are needed to}} enable organizational reward systems to operate successfully. First, for a collective assessment to be appropriate for individual team members, the group's tasks must be highly interdependent. If {{this is not the}} case, individual assessment is more appropriate than team assessment. Second, individual-level reward systems and team-level reward systems must be compatible. For example, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> reward the entire team for a job well done if only one team member did most of the work. That team member would most likely view teams and teamwork negatively, and would not want to work on a team in the future. Third, an organizational culture must be created such that it supports and rewards employees who believe in the value of teamwork and who maintain a positive attitude towards team-based rewards.|$|E

25|$|In Taiwan, Guoyu (national language) {{continues}} to be the official term for Standard Chinese. The term Guoyu however, is less used in the PRC, because declaring a Beijing dialect-based standard to be the national language <b>would</b> <b>be</b> deemed <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> speakers of other varieties and to the ethnic minorities. The term Putonghua (common speech), on the contrary, implies nothing more than the notion of a lingua franca.|$|R
500|$|Branson also later thanked local {{residents}} {{for their help}} at the accident site, describing how he [...] "was very impressed to hear how those kind people rallied round, opening their hearts and opening their doors to strangers in distress". Local farmers assisted the emergency services by transporting equipment using quad bikes and four-wheel drive vehicles. Sergeant Jo Fawcett of the Cumbria Constabulary also offered thanks, saying that [...] "There {{are so many people}} who have given up their own time to contribute in some way to dealing with the aftermath of the derailment that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> name them for fear of missing someone out." ...|$|E
500|$|Fonville {{competed in}} the Olympic trials in Evanston, Illinois in mid-July 1948, {{but he was not}} able to meet his own {{standards}} as a result of the injury. He finished fourth and, despite having broken the world record just three months earlier, did not qualify for the U.S. Olympic team. There were some who suggested that Fonville should be named to the Olympic team despite his fourth-place finish at the trials; others argued it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> the third-place finisher to take away his spot on the team. And [...] "there was also a suspicion that Fonville's ailing back hadn't healed and that his performance at Evanston represented the best he can do at this time." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{end of each}} issue, {{with the}} {{exception}} of issue twelve, contains supplemental prose pieces written by Moore. Among the contents are fictional book chapters, letters, reports, and articles written by various Watchmen characters. DC had trouble selling ad space in issues of Watchmen, which left an extra eight to nine pages per issue. DC planned to insert house ads and a longer letters column to fill the space, but editor Len Wein felt this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> anyone who wrote in during the last four issues of the series. He decided to use the extra pages to fill out the series' backstory. Moore said, [...] "By the time we got around to issue #3, #4, and so on, we thought that the book looked nice without a letters page. It looks less like a comic book, so we stuck with it." ...|$|E
50|$|On September 3, 2013, Hernandez's lawyers filed a {{postponement}} request {{in federal}} court until his murder charges were resolved. They said it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> legally <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> Hernandez to permit the lawsuit to continue {{while he was on}} trial in the shooting death of 27-year-old Odin Lloyd. In February 2016, Hernandez reached a settlement with Bradley over the lawsuit. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed.|$|R

Besides, Tom Moran is a man I'm specially sorry for. As I told you, he left a young wife and a very little child behind him {{when he came out}} here." ...|$|R
500|$|The acting {{was also}} praised by many critics; Lejeune {{wrote that the}} actors portray [...] "real people doing real things under real conditions", while the {{reviewer}} for The Monthly Film Bulletin considered that [...] "a talented cast sees to it that no island character study shall go unnoticed", while the lead roles [...] "make {{the most of their}} opportunities". The reviewer for the Manchester Guardian considered Radford to have played his part [...] "with unusual subtlety", and thought that among the remainder of the cast [...] "there are so many excellent performances that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> pick out two or three names for special praise". The critic Bosley Crowther, writing in The New York Times, thought that Radford and Watson were the stand-out actors of the film, although he also considered the rest of the cast strong.|$|E
500|$|The album {{did receive}} some criticism. After noting Garland's lifelong attempt to master pitch and articulation, Christgau claimed Wainwright's habit of [...] "slid past notes and draw out the final syllables of lines are {{signatures}} indistinguishable from tics". Entertainment Weeklys Chris Willman wrote that Wainwright's [...] "delicate upper range is nicely attuned {{to some of}} the ballads, but anything that requires belting is pretty much a loss". Mark Edwards of The Times called Wainwright's performance an acquired taste, stating his [...] "trademark delivery" [...] is [...] "lazy and somewhat slurred". Dave Hughes' review pointed out Wainwright's [...] "problem with the brassy high notes in an otherwise energetic take on 'That's Entertainment'", but admits it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> hold this against him since Garland's live performance was not perfect either. Hughes appropriately notes, [...] "Ain't nobody perfect".|$|E
500|$|Her media {{appearances}} were criticised {{for their}} awkwardness. In September 2012, Richard Seymour of The Guardian described how she [...] "fluffed her lines" [...] {{during an interview}} with STV reporter Bernard Ponsonby following her announcement of Labour's public service policy review. Peter Ross of The Scotsman cites another interview, {{in which she was}} repeatedly questioned about her views on the UK Trident programme. But he describes her in person as [...] "articulate, reflective, self-deprecating and at times very funny. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> condemn her for not being a sound-bite politician; she ought to be applauded for it, but the trouble is we live in a sound-bite age." [...] Mandy Rhodes of Holyrood magazine writes, [...] "despite a reputation as being a bit of a fierce one, [...] is actually, really rather entertaining, engaging and wonderfully self-deprecating." [...] The BBC's Marianne Taylor describes Lamont as [...] "Quietly spoken and more humorous in person than she comes across on television".|$|E
25|$|For example, if Team 1 batted for 20 overs before rain came, {{thinking}} {{they would have}} 50 overs in total, but at the re-start there was only time for Team 2 to bat for 20 overs, it <b>would</b> clearly <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> give Team 2 the target that Team 1 achieved, as Team 1 would have batted less conservatively and scored more runs, if they had known they would only have the 20 overs.|$|R
5000|$|In 2013 {{he became}} the first person to decline the $100,000 Gairdner Foundation International Award stating [...] "I felt that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> of me <b>to</b> accept this award without the {{inclusion}} of two colleagues, Dr. Qui-Lim Choo and Dr. George Kuo." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not know, mademoiselle. I am {{an old man}} who {{has never}} loved, and so it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> of me <b>to</b> pass {{judgment}} upon lovers. That they think not as other folk is notorious; their minds are for the time disordered." ...|$|R
500|$|Asser's {{response}} to Alfred's request {{was to ask}} for time to consider the offer, as he felt it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> abandon his current position in favour of worldly recognition. Alfred agreed but also suggested that he should spend half his time at St David's and half with Alfred. Asser again asked for time to consider, but ultimately agreed to return to Alfred with an answer in six months. On his return to Wales, however, Asser fell ill with a fever and was confined to the monastery of Caerwent for twelve months and a week. Alfred wrote {{to find out the}} cause of the delay, and Asser responded that he would keep his promise when he recovered. When he did recover, in 886, he agreed to divide his time between Wales and Alfred's court, as Alfred had suggested. Others at St David's supported this, since they hoped Asser's influence with Alfred would avoid [...] "damaging afflictions and injuries at the hands of King Hyfaidd (who often assaulted that monastery and the jurisdiction of St David)".|$|E
500|$|Mortal Kombat has {{received}} critical acclaim. GameZone's David Sanchez considered describing Mortal Kombat as [...] "a fitting reboot for the series" [...] {{to be an}} understatement, as [...] "while offering plenty of nostalgia" [...] the game is also [...] "a major step up for the series". Andrew Reiner of Game Informer called it [...] "the best Mortal Kombat yet." [...] According to Mark Waltron of GameSpot, [...] "over-the-top, bloody, and bursting with content, Mortal Kombat {{is a return to}} form for the franchise." [...] IGN's Ryan Clements called it an [...] "amazing" [...] game that [...] "combines the novelty of extreme violence with a great fighting engine." [...] Neidel Crisan of 1UP.com stated it [...] "has simply set the standard for future fighting games to follow." [...] Eurogamer's Matt Edwards was more critical of the game, but added that [...] "to judge Mortal Kombat harshly simply because it isn’t the equal of BlazBlue or Street Fighter IV on a technical level <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> what the game does right." [...] Brett Elston of GamesRadar was also more cautious in his review, stating it is [...] "a successful sequel that both reboots and redeems the wayward series, though it’s not a flawless victory." ...|$|E
500|$|Isabella and {{her main}} work have been {{subjected}} to criticism {{over the course of the}} twentieth century. Elizabeth David complains of recipes that are [...] "sometimes slapdash and misleading", although she acknowledges that Prosper Montagné's Larousse Gastronomique also contains errors. The television cook Delia Smith admits she was puzzled [...] "how on earth Mrs Beeton's book managed to utterly eclipse... superior work", while her fellow chef, Clarissa Dickson Wright, opines that [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> blame any one person or one book for the decline of English cookery, but Isabella Beeton and her ubiquitous book do have a lot to answer for." [...] In comparison, the food writer Bee Wilson opines that disparaging Isabella's work was only a [...] "fashionable" [...] stance to take and that the cook's writing [...] "simply makes you want to cook". Christopher Driver, the journalist and food critic, suggests that the [...] "relative stagnation and want of refinement in the indigenous cooking of Britain between 1880 and 1930" [...] may instead be explained by the [...] "progressive debasement under successive editors, revises and enlargers". David comments that [...] "when plain English cooks" [...] were active in their kitchens, [...] "they followed plain English recipes and chiefly those from the Mrs Beeton books or their derivatives". Dickson Wright considers Beeton to be a [...] "fascinating source of information" [...] from a social history viewpoint, and Aylett and Ordish consider the work to be [...] "the best and most reliable guide for the scholar to the domestic history of the mid-Victorian era".|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of duress, the {{defendant}} has committed the act {{in response to a}} threat of death or serious personal injury to himself or a loved one, or someone towards whom he feels responsible. Therefore he is removed of fault as his actions were done to prevent such harm being done. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> considered <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> place the defendant at fault of a criminal action which he committed under duress.|$|R
5000|$|Even though Mihaela had a {{reserved}} {{place for}} the judges houses, {{she decided not to}} use it and start the show from the auditions, as she said that <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> the other participants.

At the final she made a duet with James Arthur, the winner of the ninth series of The X Factor UK in 2012.|$|R
60|$|It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> wholly <b>unfair</b> <b>to</b> judge Anarchist doctrine, or {{the views}} of its leading exponents, by such phenomena; but it remains a fact that Anarchism attracts to itself much that lies on the {{borderland}} of insanity and common crime.[18] This must be remembered in exculpation of the authorities and the thoughtless public, who often confound in a common detestation the parasites of the movement and the truly heroic and high-minded men who have elaborated its theories and sacrificed comfort and success to their propagation.|$|R
