500|$|The Kazon were {{inspired}} by Los Angeles gangs, and were referenced in a [...] "shorthand 'Crips' and 'Bloods' fashion". The idea for the Kazon as warrior sects, {{as opposed to a}} unified race, was introduced by Taylor, who drafted them as [...] "three gangs, with constantly shifting relationships and allegiances. Just as <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> sorted it out, the balance shifts again." [...] While discussing the Kazon's original inspiration, Taylor viewed them as a way [...] "to address the tenor of our times and what [...] was happening in our cities and recognizing a source of danger and social unrest". Piller further described the premise for the Kazon as rooted in gang violence and warfare by clarifying: [...] "Our intention was to create a sort of disorganized anarchy, them-against-them as much as them-against-us." ...|$|E
500|$|After a Week 8 bye, Hester caught four {{passes for}} 42 yards {{and had an}} 11-yard run against the Detroit Lions. He {{eventually}} lost his kick return duties to Danieal Manning, but began receiving more playing time as a wide receiver. Between Week 12 and 15, Hester caught 17 passes for 250 yards and one touchdown. David Haugh of the Chicago Tribune regarded Hester as the team's [...] "biggest threat in the passing game." [...] He concluded the season by catching 51 passes for a team high 665 yards. Unlike his previous two seasons in the NFL, Hester did not record a single touchdown return and only averaged 6.2 yards per punt return. Lovie Smith commented on Hester {{at the end of}} the season by saying, [...] "I know his returns dropped off a little bit this year, but his plate was full there for a while. <b>We</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a happy medium now for him as a punt returner and continuing to develop as a receiver." [...] Hester was also selected to play in the 2009 Pro Bowl as a third alternate.|$|E

There are, however, other reasons which make it impossible. This question is most difficult to solve. The most prominent of both modern and ancient astronomers have deeply studied the question of the moving of the earth, and tried to refute it. We, too, have composed a book on the subject called Miftah-ilm-alhai'a (Key to Astronomy), in which <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> surpassed our predecessors, if not in the words, at all events in the matter.|$|E
2500|$|It was announced, after airing {{thirteen}} episodes, {{that the}} new run of Iron Chef would be discontinued after the last episode on March 22, 2013. Mr. Tatematsu, General Manager of Editing, explained, "Iron Chef is a high quality show and we can say it is FujiTV's treasure. Currently we are struggling for the ratings. <b>We</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a time slot problem, too, so {{we would like to}} consider about a way to make it as special program and forward it into the next stage." [...] On July 3, 2013 the Iron Chefs reunited for an American Chef Special with beef as the secret ingredient. All three Iron Chefs were paired with an American challenger, and then for a fourth round, all six competed. Currently, there are no plans for any more Iron Chef specials.|$|E

40|$|Decades of {{research}} {{have shown that}} much of our mental processing occurs at the subconscious level, including the decisions we make as consumers. These subconscious processes explain why we so often fail to accurately predict our own future choices.

60|$|Thus {{it is our}} {{particular}} thoughts and feelings that have primitive certainty. And this applies to dreams and hallucinations {{as well as to}} normal perceptions: when we dream or see a ghost, we certainly do have the sensations <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have,</b> but for various reasons it is held that no physical object corresponds to these sensations. Thus the certainty of our knowledge of our own experiences {{does not have to be}} limited in any way to allow for exceptional cases.

When we hear them, why seem they so natural, receiving our spontaneous approval? why do <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> heard them before?
