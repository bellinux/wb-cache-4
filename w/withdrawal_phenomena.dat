50|$|The {{likelihood}} of dependence is relatively high with lorazepam {{compared to other}} benzodiazepines. Lorazepam's relatively short serum half-life, its confinement mainly to the vascular space, and its inactive metabolite, can result in interdose <b>withdrawal</b> <b>phenomena</b> and next-dose cravings, that may reinforce psychological dependence. Because of its high potency, the smallest lorazepam tablet strength of 0.5 mg is also a significant dose reduction (in the UK, the smallest tablet strength is 1.0 mg, which further accentuates this difficulty). To minimise the risk of physical/psychological dependence, lorazepam is best used only short-term, at the smallest effective dose. If any benzodiazepine has been used long-term, the recommendation is a gradual dose taper {{over a period of}} weeks, months or longer, according to dose and duration of use, degree of dependence and the individual.|$|E

40|$|Because the {{mechanism}} of adverse reactions to abrupt cessation of propranolol in patients with coronary heart disease was an enigma, we studied the effect of cessation of propranolol on beta-adrenergic receptor reactivity to catecholamine stimulation. The cyclic AMP concentrations in plasma and left ventricular muscle after the administration of isoproterenol (5 mg/Kg) were measured in rats before, during, 2 days after, and 4 days after of the administration of propranolol (5 mg/Kg). Two days after withdrawal from propranolol, the cyclic AMP concentrations in plasma and left ventricular muscle were significantly increased (p< 0. 005, p< 0. 01). Four days after withdrawal from propranolol, the cyclic AMP concentration in plasma was significantly increased (p< 0. 001).

From these results, this study supports {{that there is a}} hypersensitivity to adrenergic stimulation after abrupt cessation of long-term propranolol treatment.

This observation has led to the belief that a tobacco withdrawal syndrome exists which implies a physical dependence to tobacco. However, at the present time, it is unclear if all or any of the reactions following tobacco deprivation are in fact indica-tors of physical dependence.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundTobacco {{withdrawal}} symptoms may be confounded with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms among smokers with ADHD. Objective(1) To assess overlap between ADHD symptoms and tobacco/nicotine {{withdrawal symptoms}} and craving; (2) {{to assess the}} relationship between craving or withdrawal symptoms {{and the effect of}} osmotic-release oral system methylphenidate (OROS-MPH) on ADHD symptoms; (3) to assess the association of ADHD symptoms, craving, and withdrawal symptoms with abstinence. MethodsSecondary analysis of a randomized, placebo controlled smoking cessation trial assessing the efficacy of OROS-MPH taken in addition to nicotine patch among individuals with ADHD. ADHD symptoms, withdrawal symptoms, and craving were assessed at baseline and 2, 4 and 6 weeks after a target quit day. ResultsWithdrawal symptoms and craving showed limited and modest overlap with ADHD symptoms prior to abstinence but more extensive and stronger correlation after quit day. Compared to placebo, OROS-MPH reduced ADHD symptoms; this effect was attenuated by controlling for withdrawal symptoms, but not by craving. Craving, but not ADHD symptoms and withdrawal symptoms, was associated with abstinence during the trial. ConclusionWhen treating smokers with ADHD (1) craving, rather than tobacco withdrawal symptoms or ADHD symptoms may be the more effective therapeutic smoking cessation targets; (2) careful distinction of craving, withdrawal symptoms, and ADHD symptoms when assessing <b>withdrawal</b> <b>phenomena</b> is needed...|$|E
40|$|In their 2016 {{commentary}} on our theorizing about how youth withdrawal from {{economic and social}} participation in Japanese society (i. e., NEET and Hikikomori phenomena) stems from generational inequality of economic opportunities, Varnum and Kwon correctly point out that our explanation for withdrawal is yet untested.

While we agree with this premise, we argue that this distal explanatory framework, at least in its current form, has limits in reconciling some of the more recent cross-cultural observations, as well as well-established sociological claims about the causes of withdrawal.

40|$|Moxonidine and {{rilmenidine}} are moderately selective I 1 -receptor stimulants. The imidazoline (I 1) agonists cause peripheral sympathoinhibition, triggered at {{the level}} of central nervous imidazoline receptors. Imidazoline receptor stimulants are effective antihypertensive agents with a hemodynamic profile that is attractive from a pathophysiologic point of view. The antihypertensive activity of these agents is caused by vasodilatation and reduced peripheral vascular resistance. Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volume is reduced, whereas heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, and pulmonary artery pressures are largely unchanged. Long-term left ventricular hypertrophy is reduced. Both drugs, when applied in a once-daily dosage schedule, appear to control hypertension in most patients. Both drugs have been compared with representative agents from the major classes of antihypertensive drugs in controlled trials and found to be equally effective in blood pressure control. The incidence and severity of side effects are lower than those for clonidine, particularly with respect to sedation. A rebound (<b>withdrawal)</b> <b>phenomenon</b> has so far not been reported for moxonidine and rilmenidine.

The relationship between “addiction” and various compulsive or impulsive behaviors is also a source of confusion.

It is not clear whether internet addiction usually represents a manifestation of an underlying disorder, or is truly a discrete disease entity. The frequent appearance of internet addiction in the context of numerous comorbid conditions raises complex questions of causality. In order to make nosological decisions regarding internet addiction, we require a more general model of what counts as “disease,” and as a specific disease. Based on a model emphasizing intrinsic suffering and incapacity, as well as data regarding course, prognosis, temporal stability, and response to treatment, it appears premature to consider internet addiction as a discrete disease entity. However, growing research suggests that some individuals with internet addiction are at significant risk and merit our professional care and treatment.

Please click on the hyperlink in Additional Links fieldPhysiological dependence on benzodiazepines {{is accompanied by a}} withdrawal syndrome which is typically characterized by sleep disturbance, irritability, increased tension and anxiety, panic attacks, hand tremor, sweating, difficulty in concentration, dry wretching and nausea, some weight loss, palpitations, headache, muscular pain and stiffness and a host of perceptual changes. Instances are also reported within the high-dosage category of more serious developments such as seizures and psychotic reactions. Withdrawal from normal dosage benzodiazepine treatment can result in a number of symptomatic patterns. The most common is a short-lived "rebound" anxiety and insomnia, coming on within 1 - 4 days of discontinuation, depending on the half-life of the particular drug. The second pattern is the full-blown withdrawal syndrome, usually lasting 10 - 14 days; finally, a third pattern may represent the return of anxiety symptoms which then persist until some form of treatment is instituted. Physiological dependence on benzodiazepines can occur following prolonged treatment with therapeutic doses, {{but it is not clear}} what proportion of patients are likely to experience a withdrawal syndrome. It is also unknown to what extent the risk of physiological dependence is dependent upon a minimum duration of exposure or dosage of these drugs. <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>phenomena</b> appear to be more severe following withdrawal from high doses or short-acting benzodiazepines.

30|$|Sedation and {{analgesia}} {{is particularly}} challenging {{in children with}} regards to a specific metabolism because tolerance and <b>withdrawal</b> <b>phenomena</b> are frequently observed in cases of prolonged administration [9]. Many studies have proved that continuous intravenous perfusion of drugs is associated with longer mechanical ventilation [2, 3]. Recent years have seen emerging techniques of goal-directed sedation. These include daily interruption of sedatives and nurse-driven protocols. In adults, Kress et al. [10] evaluated daily interruption of sedatives and showed {{a significant reduction in}} the duration of mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, and cumulative doses of midazolam and opioids. Nurse-driven sedation and analgesia protocols were evaluated in adults and, despite interesting results [11 – 13], a Cochrane review in 2015 concluded that there was insufficient evidence {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} protocol-directed sedation [14]. In paediatric units, goal-directed sedation protocols were also developed but few studies were found in the literature, with unclear results [15 – 17]. Recently, a randomised controlled trial among children admitted in PICU for acute lung injury showed no difference in duration of ventilation regardless of sedation protocol or usual care implementation [18]. Daily interruption of sedation was also studied in PICU: Gupta et al. [19] and Verlaat et al. [20] showed a significant reduction in duration of mechanical ventilation, PICU length of stay, and duration of benzodiazepine perfusion with a daily sedation interruption protocol. However, more recently a RCT including 129 patients [21] under sedation protocol assessed the impact of daily sedation interruption in critically ill children and no improvement of clinical outcomes was found; an increased mortality was even found in the group with daily sedation interruption without any evidence of a relationship.|$|E
40|$|The {{reports of}} a unique {{mutation}} in the Janus kinase- 2 gene (JAK 2) in polycythemia vera by several independent groups in 2005 quickly spurred {{the development of the}} Janus kinase inhibitors.

With the approval of ruxolitinib by the US Federal Drug Administration in November 2011 for high-risk and intermediate- 2 risk myelofibrosis, a change in paradigm has occurred in the management of a subset of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) : primary myelofibrosis, post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis, and post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis.

40|$|Objective: To {{separate}} hormone-dependent from hormonally relapsed prostate cancers, a D 3 category {{has been}} proposed. The term has {{become synonymous with}} a hormone-refractory state with the implication that any further hormonal treatment would not be beneficial. In this review we examine some data on androgen receptor expression, anti-androgen withdrawal syndrome and intermittent androgen deprivation (IAD) in patients with advanced prostate cancer. Materials: The literature on the mechanism of the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in patients with prostate cancer submitted to hormone therapy was reviewed. Experimental and clinical data are reported. Results. The progression of prostate cancer in patients treated with combined androgen blockade (CAB) {{is associated with the}} activation of previously androgen-repressed genes, some of which may code for autocrine and paracrine growth factors that substitute for androgens in maintaining the viability of the tumorigenic stem cells. If androgens are replaced before progression begins, the surviving stem cells should give rise to an androgen-dependent tumor, which would be amenable to retreatment by CAB. This theory provides the rationale for intermittent androgen deprivation. We suggest that IAD could be more effective in patients with initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression after radical prostatectomy. Conclusions: Response to withdrawal therapies or second-line treatments {{is an example of a}} "hormonal" therapy that may benefit a proportion of patients with hormone-refractory disease, suggesting that the tumor is still androgen-dependent, Whether IAD enhances progression-free survival or overall survival must be verified in randomized clinical trials.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Tolerance to the {{behavioural}} {{effects of}} morphine is blunted in β-arrestin- 2 knockout mice, but opioid withdrawal is largely unaffected. The cellular mechanisms of tolerance {{have been studied}} in some neurons from β-arrestin- 2 knockouts, but tolerance and withdrawal mechanisms have not been examined at the cellular level in periaqueductal grey (PAG) neurons, which are crucial for central tolerance and <b>withdrawal</b> <b>phenomena.</b> Experimental Approach: μ-Opioid receptor (MOPr) inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channel currents (ICa) was examined by patch-clamp recordings from acutely dissociated PAG neurons from wild-type and β-arrestin- 2 knockout mice treated chronically with morphine (CMT) or vehicle. Opioid withdrawal-induced activation of GABA transporter type 1 (GAT- 1) currents was determined using perforated patch recordings from PAG neurons in brain slices. Key Results: MOPr inhibition of ICa in PAG neurons was unaffected by β-arrestin- 2 deletion. CMT impaired coupling of MOPrs to ICa in PAG neurons from wild-type mice, but this cellular tolerance was not observed in neurons from CMT β-arrestin- 2 knockouts. However, β-arrestin- 2 knockouts displayed similar opioid-withdrawal-induced activation of GAT- 1 currents as wild-type PAG neurons. Conclusions and Implications: In β-arrestin- 2 knockout mice, the central neurons involved in the anti-nociceptive actions of opioids also fail to develop cellular tolerance to opioids following chronic morphine. The results also provide the first cellular physiological evidence that opioid withdrawal is not disrupted by β-arrestin- 2 deletion. However, the unaffected basal sensitivity to opioids in PAG neurons provides further evidence that changes in basal MOPr sensitivity cannot account for the enhanced acute nociceptive response to morphine reported in β-arrestin- 2 knockouts. 9 page(s...|$|E
40|$|There are {{a growing}} number of studies on {{structural}} and functional brain mechanisms underlying Internet gaming disorder (IGD). Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies showed that IGD adolescents and adults had reduced gray matter volume in regions associated with attention motor coordination executive function and perception. Adolescents with IGD showed lower white matter (WM) integrity measures in several brain regions that are involved in decision-making, behavioral inhibition, and emotional regulation. IGD adolescents had also disruption in the functional connectivity in areas responsible for learning memory and executive function, processing of auditory, visual, and somatosensory stimuli and relay of sensory and motor signals. IGD adolescents also had decreased functional connectivity of PFC-striatal circuits, increased risk-taking choices, and impaired ability to control their impulses similar to other impulse control disorders. Recent studies indicated that altered executive control mechanisms in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) would be a predisposition for developing IGD. Finally, patients with IGD have also shown an increased functional connectivity of several executive control brain regions that may related to comorbidity with ADHD and depression. The behavioral addiction model argues that IGD shows the features of excessive use despite adverse consequences, <b>withdrawal</b> <b>phenomena,</b> and tolerance that characterize substance use disorders. The evidence supports the behavioral addiction model of IGD by showing structural and functional changes in the mechanisms of reward and craving (but not withdrawal) in IGD.

A recent double-blind placebo-controlled study demonstrated 6 -month efficacy {{and safety of}} PRM in insomnia patients aged 18 &ndash; 80 and lack of withdrawal and rebound symptoms upon discontinuation. Objective: To investigate the efficacy, safety, and <b>withdrawal</b> <b>phenomena</b> associated with 6 &ndash; 12 months PRM treatment. Methods: Data from a prospective 6 &ndash; 12 -month open-label study of 244 community dwelling adults with primary insomnia, {{who had participated in}} a placebo-controlled, double-blind dose-ranging trial of PRM. Patients received PRM nightly, followed by a 2 -week withdrawal period. Main outcome measures were patient-reported sleep quality ratings (diary), adverse events, vital signs, and laboratory tests recorded at each visit, and withdrawal symptoms (CHESS- 84 [Check-list Evaluation of Somatic Symptoms]). Nocturnal urinary 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin excretion, a measure of the endogenous melatonin production, was assessed upon discontinuing long-term PRM. Results: Of the 244 patients, 36 dropped out, 112 completed 6 months of treatment, and the other 96 completed 12 months of treatment. The mean number of nights by which patients reported sleep quality as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;very good&quot; was significantly higher during PRM than before treatment. There was no evidence of tolerance to PRM. Discontinuation of PRM was not associated with rebound insomnia or withdrawal symptoms; on the contrary, residual benefit was observed.

30|$|While sunitinib therapy {{leads to}} a {{pronounced}} reduction in tumor hypoxia, termination of therapy resulted in an increased hypoxia with even higher levels of [18 F]FAZA uptake compared to the control tumors.

Similar rebound effects were observed in human renal cell cancer, where the SUV of [18 F]FLT increased by 15 % after sunitinib withdrawal [38]. Currently, patients receive sunitinib in an on-and-off regimen [50]. Following treatment discontinuation, patients sometimes experience recurrent pain in metastatic sites, {{as a result of}} flare re-growth. It has been proposed that during this period of withdrawal, tumor cells are stuck in the `S' phase and therefore are more vulnerable to combination cytotoxic chemotherapy [38].

30|$|Although {{a direct}} {{interaction}} of AA with the AR and a switch to an agonist of a mutated AR {{has been discussed}} as mechanism for therapy resistance (Cronauer et al. 2013), our results can all be explained by an exclusive AA effect on steroidogenesis and low affinity to AR. Actually, selection for a gain-of-function mutation in prostate cancer cells is most conceivable when androgens are scarce as under androgen deprivation and {{in the presence of}} high-affinity AR ligand. A therapy resistance based upon this principle may only arise under androgen deprivation in combination with an anti-androgen with demonstrable high affinity to the androgen receptor. With an effective binding of a ligand, the incidence of a gain-of-function mutation which turns an anti-androgen into an androgen thusly granted prevalence for an activated mutated AR no longer blocked by the anti-androgen. Therefore, therapy resistance, especially a most menacing anti-androgen <b>withdrawal</b> <b>phenomenon</b> is more comprehensible for anti-androgen therapy than androgen deprivation. In this study we showed that CYP 17 A 1 up-regulation, the presumed resistance mechanism to AA therapy is not restricted to androgen signalling in the de facto presence of AA. When androgen signalling is impaired by other means e.g. by RNA interference with AR expression by specific siRNA (Figure  4) the same effect becomes evident. Interestingly, VCaP cells under hydroxyl-flutamide or bicalutamide treatment also showed up-regulated CYP 17 A 1 and down-regulated AKR 1 C 3 expression (Kumagai et al. 2013), we demonstrated for AA treatments (Figure  1). Therefore, CYP 17 A 1 up-regulation obviously is indicative for effective impairment of AR signalling in general not limited to AA treatments and may represent a negative feedback loop (Auchus and Auchus 2012). Although all AA effects on AR positive cells VCaP, LNCaP and BPH- 1 appear to be attributed to an inhibitory influence on steroidogenesis, our results from AR knock-down experiments and AR negative PC- 3 cells cannot fully exclude the notion of AA binding the AR and partly inhibiting AR-signalling. There are conflicting results from previous studies which either excluded binding of AA to AR or detected direct AA binding to the AR in vitro assays despite low affinity as compared with pure antiandrogens (Handratta et al. 2005; Richards et al. 2012).|$|R

In vitro, the selectivity and potency of JNJ- 42153605 were characterized. In vivo, effects on sleep measures were investigated in rats after once daily oral repeated treatment for 7 days, withdrawal and consecutive re-administration of LY 354740 (1 - 10 mg/kg) and JNJ- 42153605 (3 - 30 mg/kg). JNJ- 42153605 showed high affinity, potency and selectivity at mGluR 2. Binding site analyses and knowledge-based docking confirmed the specificity of JNJ- 42153605 at the mGluR 2 allosteric binding site. Acute LY 354740 and JNJ- 42153605 dose-dependently decreased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time and prolonged its onset latency. Sub chronic effects of LY 354740 on REM sleep measures disappeared from day 3 onwards, whereas those of JNJ- 42153605 were maintained after repeated exposure. LY 354740 attenuated REM sleep homeostatic recovery, while this was preserved after JNJ- 42153605 administration. JNJ- 42153605 enhanced sleep continuity and efficiency, suggesting its potential as an add-on medication for impaired sleep quality during early stages of treatment. Abrupt cessation of JNJ- 42153605 did not induce <b>withdrawal</b> <b>phenomena</b> and sleep disturbances, while the initial drug effect was fully reinstated after re-administration. Collectively, long-term treatment with JNJ- 42153605 did not induce tolerance phenomena to its primary functional effects on sleep measures, nor adverse effects at withdrawal, while it promoted homeostatic recovery sleep. From the translational perspective, the present rodent findings suggest that mGluR 2 positive allosteric modulation has therapeutic potential based on its superior long term efficacy over agonists in psychiatric disorders, particularly of those commonly occurring with REM sleep overdrive...|$|E
40|$|Unipolar and bipolar {{depression}} are episodic, recurrent illnesses for {{the majority}} of patients. Because each episode engenders considerable costs for patients, families, and society, prevention of recurrences has high priority. Numerous studies demonstrate that maintenance antidepressants or mood stabilizing medications are efficacious in preventing recurrences. A review of maintenance studies supports the view that all antidepressants perform significantly better than placebo in preventing recurrences of depression—with the stipulation that full antidepressant doses be employed. Earliest studies, conducted two decades ago, evaluated tricyclics (TCAs), heterocyclics, and lithium, while recent studies have focused on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Compliance is essential. Strategies for enhancing compliance include selection of medications with reported safety and few side effects, education of patients and families, referral to patient advocacy groups, and use of new technological compliance aids. Preliminary data suggest that SSRIs are better tolerated than TCAs; fewer patients discontinue these agents due to side effects. Selection criteria for maintenance treatment have not been well determined, but three or more prior episodes is recognized as a relatively strong indicator. Other clinical or genetic criteria have also been suggested. For various reasons, patients may discontinue medications, and when this happens <b>withdrawal</b> <b>phenomena</b> may occur. Withdrawal effects are well documented for all antidepressants and can be profound with TCAs. After stopping some SSRIs, a few withdrawal symptoms may have similarities with those following discontinuation of TCAs, but unique “CNS-like” effects are frequently described, including brief recurrent episodes of dizziness, lightheadedness, vertigo, electric shock-like sensations, and gait instability. These appear to be half-life dependent, with agents with shorter half-lives having more discontinuation symptoms. If antidepressant medications must be discontinued, a gradual taper is preferable, perhaps extending three to six months or longer to prevent discontinuation effects, enable adaptation at the receptor level and allow earlier recognition and treatment of recurrent depressive symptoms.

30|$|PET {{radiotracers}} {{were used}} in several clinical and numerous preclinical studies to detect tumor hypoxia and predict and analyze tumor response to chemotherapy. These tracers {{may play a role}} in guiding hypoxia-specific treatment in cancer patients [30]. Most commonly, [18 F]FMISO and [18 F]FDG were used to detect effects of a therapy with TKIs such as sunitinib or sorafenib [31]-[36]. To date, only one preclinical study was performed using [18 F]FAZA [37]. Here, the effects of gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, were monitored. The current study utilizes [18 F]FAZA to detect functional changes in the microenvironment of a renal cell carcinoma mouse model during sunitinib therapy and subsequent withdrawal. It is known that a TKI therapy regimen, which is typically split into therapeutic fractions, induces a <b>withdrawal</b> flare <b>phenomenon</b> in RCC patients [38],[39]. The goal of this study was to determine whether these treatment-induced changes in tumor hypoxia can be detected and quantified using a PET radiotracer for hypoxia in an animal model. This ability could help optimize the timing of combination therapy in metastatic RCC patients. [18 F]FAZA has been chosen because of its lower lipophylicity and elevated clearance.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{understand}} "hikikomori (social <b>withdrawal)</b> " <b>phenomenon</b> {{from the viewpoint of}} "hikikomori" themselves. The analysis was done through three autobiographical works by "hikikomori" based on two aspects: the relationship between "hikikomori" and the society from which they have withdrawn, and the relationship between "hikikomori" and their homes to which they withdraw. It is suggested that "hikikomori" people are afraid of working in society, {{but at the same time}} they internalize the social values that they have to be working, which leads to a the negative spiral where they are ashamed of themselves for not working and find it even more difficult to participate in society. As they are in a negative spiral because of the negative message they receive from the society, "hikikomori" can be thought of as an illness of social relationships. A similar spiral can be seen in the relationship between "hikikomori" people and their parents who apply pressure to them with social values. The perspective of "hikikomori" as an illness of social relationships leads us to question our social values and how we can respond to the message from "hikikomori" and improre the way we live in society...|$|R
40|$|Innovation {{scholars}} and dominant discourses relegate destruction and withdrawal as being secondary, collateral or unavoidable aspects of innovation processes. The chapter qualifies these dominant thoughts on innovation, be they classical or contemporary, and identifies destruction, exnovation and <b>withdrawal</b> as relevant <b>phenomena.</b> It uses {{a case study}} on the withdrawal of tilling in agriculture to propose an alternative {{way of thinking about}} innovation, one whereby withdrawal is not an evidence phenomenon but a complex process, engaging strategic thinking and controversies, as well as creativity, invention and innovation. The chapter suggests that innovation through withdrawal is a growing phenomenon requiring empirical and theoretical investigations. It also suggests that disciplinary bias, cultural values and ideology explain the neglect of destruction or withdrawal in discourses and theories about innovation. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Typical {{characteristics}} of socially withdrawn youths include seclusion at home, absence from school or work, and minimal social contact. This phenomenon, called hikikomori in Japan or youth social withdrawal in other countries, has raised concern in technologically advanced high-income societies. Unfortunately, socially withdrawn youths {{are difficult to}} identify and their risks can be ‘invisible’ because of their withdrawn nature. Study 1 in this thesis presents a systematic review of the available scientific information on youth social withdrawal in the academic databases: ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Web of Science and PubMed. 42 articles published in English and academic peer-reviewed journals were reviewed and synthesized into the following categories: definitions of youth social withdrawal, developmental theories, factors associated with youth social withdrawal and interventions for socially withdrawn youths. A theoretical framework depicting youth social withdrawal {{as a result of}} the interplay between psychological, social, and behavioral factors was proposed; and different interventions for different trajectories of youth social withdrawal were suggested. Study 2 was a cross-sectional telephone-based survey which explored the youth social <b>withdrawal</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in Hong Kong. Socially withdrawn youths were categorized according to the (1) proposed duration criterion used internationally (withdrawn for more than six months); and (2) locally (withdrawn for less than six months); and (3) self-perception as non-problematic. The prevalence of youth social withdrawal in Hong Kong (1. 9 %) was comparable to that in Japan. The correlates of social withdrawal among the three groups were examined using multinomial and ordinal logistic regression. The change of withdrawal behaviors in the framework was examined. Study 3 was a qualitative study which aimed to fill the research gap about the engagement of socially withdrawn youths. Thirty interviews of socially withdrawn youths in Hong Kong were conducted. By thematic analysis and grounded theory, their perspectives on withdrawal were conceptualized into withdrawal as suspension of experience, withdrawal as a defriending spiral and withdrawal as a private status. Their motivation to come out was conceptualized into desire to move forward, reconnection with tuned-in people and compromise between self and reality. The findings further established the framework. Study 4 was an interventional study which adopted a pre-post design to evaluate a pilot multicomponent program (n = 56) for enhancing self-esteem, employability, and reducing interaction anxiety of socially withdrawn youths in Hong Kong. A repeated measures ANOVA was conducted for each scale to compare mean scores over time (within-subjects factor) and between intervention groups (animal-assisted therapy vs. other interventional components) and withdrawal groups (the more than and less than three months’ group without mental disorder, and social withdrawal group with mental disorder; between-subjects factor). The study provided empirical evidence for the matching between withdrawal behaviors and types of intervention in the framework. Through these four studies, a framework was proposed, validated and established to advance knowledge and interventions for youth social withdrawal in high-income countries. This thesis forms the basic foundation of scientific understanding of youth social withdrawal in Hong Kong, and hopefully more advanced scientific work will be developed to tackle this emerging youth issue locally and internationally. published_or_final_versionSocial Work and Social AdministrationDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
