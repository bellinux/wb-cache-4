5|$|In 1945 Paton began {{construction}} of a wool factory at Darlington and a Rayon factory at Carrickfergus, both jobs were completed in 1951. In 1946 Paton {{was put in charge}} of an economic survey of Syria which required him to traverse the country by aircraft and car. The report, issued in 1947, recommended port, <b>water</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and irrigation improvements and the {{construction of}} a hydroelectric power station on the Euphrates River. Paton undertook a similar survey in Lebanon from 1947 to 1948. He was also involved in a report on the possibility of running a railroad from Northern Rhodesia to Dar es Salaam, Mtwara and Nyasaland.|$|E
5|$|Playford also {{successfully}} coaxed Chrysler {{to stay in}} Adelaide {{and expand}} its operations. The Housing Trust sold the Tonsley Park where the car manufacturing plant was set up, and helped to install railyards, electricity and <b>water</b> <b>infrastructure</b> there, as it had done at Elizabeth. By the time Playford left office, Holden and Chrysler employed around 11,000 workers, 11% of the state's manufacturing employees. After earlier failed attempts to bring a tyre factory to Adelaide, the plans to build the Port Stanvac oil refinery—which would produce hydrocarbons used in synthetic rubber—in the early 1960s were enough to convince both a Dunlop Rubber-Olympic joint venture and SA Rubber Mills (later Bridgestone Australia) to start manufacturing operations.|$|E

30|$|Therefore, in {{the case}} that the poorest are located in the same area and no {{specific}} neighbourhood inequality is recognized, the NSPM would work better in addressing the worst-off (the poorest), e.g., roads, telecommunications and water, in Table  8. The fact that telecommunication and <b>water</b> <b>infrastructures</b> (Table  7) appear more sensitive to NSPM indicates that similar levels of poverty are clustered. Figure  6 confirms this finding, where low-low clusters of telecommunications and <b>water</b> <b>infrastructures</b> are more dominant than the other infrastructures.|$|R

40|$|Limited water {{resources}} with uneven distribution {{in addition to}} the growing demands are the main challenges of the water governance in Iran. The Government has planned several {{water resources}} development project and due to their complex technical, socio-economical, and environmental outcomes, comprehensive evaluation is needed. To select more adaptive and accountable projects, suitable group decision support systems are also required. In this research four proposed routes of water transfer schemes to the critical drying Lake Urmia in Iran are evaluated with respect to the different criteria. The criteria and their weights are obtained from an organization that is responsible for major <b>water</b> <b>infrastructures</b> in the basin. By using efficient group multi-criteria decision making method, the four alternatives are ranked and the most robust water transfer route is selected. Results show the importance of using decision support systems to provide participatory and effective governance on <b>water</b> <b>infrastructures.</b> Key words: <b>Water</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> good governance, participatory decision making, Lake Urmia. 1...|$|R

40|$|Urban {{green space}} and water {{features}} provide numerous social, environmental, and economic benefits, yet disparities often exist in their distribution and accessibility. This study examines {{the link between}} issues of environmental justice and urban water management to evaluate potential improvements in green space and surface water access through the revitalization of existing engineered <b>water</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> namely stormwater ponds. First, relative access to green space and water features were compared for residents of Tampa, Florida, and an inner-city community of Tampa (East Tampa). Although disparities were not found in overall accessibility between Tampa and East Tampa, inequalities were apparent when quality, diversity, and size of green spaces were considered. East Tampa residents had significantly less access to larger, more desirable spaces and water features. Second, this research explored approaches for improving accessibility to green space and natural water using three integrated stormwater management development scenarios. These scenarios highlighted the ability of enhanced <b>water</b> <b>infrastructures</b> to increase access equality {{at a variety of}} spatial scales. Ultimately, the “greening” of gray urban <b>water</b> <b>infrastructures</b> is advocated as a way to address environmental justice issues while also reconnecting residents with issues of urban water management...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{integration}} of three hydraulic GIS (Geographic Information System) applications is presented which represent the <b>water</b> <b>infrastructures</b> {{of cities and}} urban areas and US streams and rivers. The <b>water</b> <b>infrastructures</b> include drinking <b>water</b> distribution systems, wastewater collection systems and source water. The National Research Council[1] states that problems dealing with the collective behavior of networks such as river systems, water distribution systems and waste water collection systems are complex because they include feedback loops, produce counter-intuitive behaviors and exhibit behaviors that cannot be predicted from the attributes of individual components. A complex system includes {{all of the above}} individual components, yet also exhibits emergent collective behavior caused by the interactions among its features. The {{integration of}} these applications have been developed for use in planning, response, training and development of monitoring strategies to address potential deliberate or accidental toxic contamination events...|$|R
