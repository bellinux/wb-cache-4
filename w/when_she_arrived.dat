5|$|Carey {{began to}} infuse her {{personality}} into her work, something that showed throughout various tracks. During her stay, she {{was influenced by}} the Latin culture, and began harmonizing and singing the music she heard there. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>arrived</b> back to New York, she already had the melody developed, and soon began working on the song in San Francisco with Afanasieff.|$|E

Lord Clyde made one cruise with the Mediterranean Fleet during which she fractured her steel mainyard in a squall. Her engines continued to deteriorate and they were condemned as no longer safe to use by the fleet engineer <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>arrived</b> in Naples. The ship was sent to the Malta Dockyard under sail for repair, but they could only make temporary repairs that would enable her to reach home.|$|E

5|$|Though Amnesty International (AI) had {{a growing}} {{reputation}} in the UK, at this time, the organization was still in largely unknown in the US. Only eighteen chapters of AI USA had been formed by 1968, {{all of them in}} the eastern US, totaling less than a thousand members. Sagan had been involved in the organization in Washington, D.C., and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>arrived</b> in Atherton, she founded the US's 19th chapter, holding its meetings in her living room. The chapter later grew into AI USA's first West Coast regional office.|$|E
5|$|After {{continuing}} {{to search for}} acting work, in 1987, Cartwright auditioned for a role {{in a series of}} animated shorts about a dysfunctional family that was to appear on The Tracey Ullman Show. Cartwright intended to audition for the role of Lisa Simpson, the middle child; <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>arrived</b> at the audition, she found the role of Bart—Lisa's brother—to be more interesting. Matt Groening, the series' creator, allowed her to audition for Bart and offered her the role on the spot. She voiced Bart for three seasons on The Tracey Ullman Show, and in 1989, the shorts were spun off into a half-hour show called The Simpsons. For her subsequent work as Bart, Cartwright received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance in 1992 and an Annie Award for Best Voice Acting in the Field of Animation in 1995.|$|E

In 1934, she resigned to take up an offer from Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago, but <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>arrived</b> the director found out that she was a woman, and refused to hire her. Jobs were hard to find during the Great Depression, and she was a consultant with no regular employment until 1938, when she took a position with Pure Oil. There she worked with Cary R. Wagner, Jr., on a book on petroleum refining. The project went on for six years, but it was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II, and the book was never published.|$|E

Daniel ranked immediately ahead of Tanzania's Magdalena Moshi (31.37seconds) and immediately behind Julianne Kirchner of the Marshall Islands in a heat led by Ugandan swimmer Olivia Aya Nakitanda (29.38seconds) and Botswana's Samantha Paxinos (29.92seconds). Of the 90 athletes who finished the event, Debra Daniel ranked 76th. Therefore, Daniel did not advance to later rounds.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1876, Yangwu visited the Australian colonies, {{and later in the}} year the Chinese ambassadors to Great Britain, Kwoh Song Tao and Liu-Si-hung, visited Yangwu via mail steamer in December while she was in Singapore. Following the visit, she sailed to Manila. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>arrived</b> in February 1877, an {{accident}} occurred as the crew were preparing a gun salute for her entrance to the harbour. As the crewman loaded the charge into one of the guns, it detonated, throwing him from the ship and killing him. The crewman was subsequently buried in the city. Yangwu proved to be a spectacle for the inhabitants of the city, particularly the Chinese, some of whom had sailed out to greet her arrival in small boats and others who watched her from the mound on which the lighthouse sat overlooking the bay.|$|E

5|$|It was {{reported}} that the plan to rid Richter of the title was concocted by WWF Chairman Vince McMahon, who brought in Moolah after Richter refused to sign a new contract with the WWF. Richter, however, claims she was still under her original five-year contract, but that she regularly had disagreements with McMahon about her compensation. She also claims that <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>arrived</b> at the arena that day, {{she was surprised to}} find Moolah backstage, as she never showed up to events at which she was not scheduled to wrestle. After the match, an infuriated Richter left the arena in her wrestling gear, took a cab to the airport, and booked herself on a flight out of New York. Afterward, she never spoke to Moolah again.|$|E

She participated in International Naval Review held at Norfolk and New York in March and April 1893, and in June sailed from Norfolk for the Far East, calling at the Azores, Gibraltar, Malta, Port Said, Bangkok, and Saigon before {{arriving}} at Hong Kong on 30 October. She cruised on the Asiatic Station until 29 May 1894 <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>arrived</b> at Unalaska.

5|$|Wealthier {{women with}} capital might invest in mines and other businesses. One {{of the most}} {{prominent}} businesswomen in the Klondike, was Belinda Mulrooney. She brought a consignment of cloth and hot water bottles with her <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>arrived</b> in the Klondike in early 1897 and with the proceeds of those sales she first built a roadhouse at Grand Forks and later a grand hotel in Dawson. She invested widely, including acquiring her own mining company, and was reputed to be the richest woman of the Klondike. The wealthy Martha Black was abandoned by her husband early in the journey to the Klondike, but continued on without him, reaching Dawson City where she became a prominent citizen, investing in various mining and business ventures with her brother.|$|E
5|$|In 1141 Alexander and the {{citizens}} of the town of Lincoln requested that Stephen come to Lincoln and intercede with Ranulf de Gernon, the Earl of Chester, who was attempting to enforce what he regarded as his rights to Lincoln Castle. Stephen arrived and besieged Ranulf's wife and half-brother in the castle, but the earl escaped and sought aid from Robert of Gloucester, Matilda's half-brother and leading supporter. Following Robert's arrival in Lincoln a battle took place there on 2 February 1141, during which Stephen was captured by Matilda's forces. Alexander was present at Oxford in July 1141, when the Empress Matilda held court and attempted to consolidate her hold on England. The citizens of London objected to Matilda's rule <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>arrived</b> in their city, and drove her away; Robert of Gloucester was captured shortly afterwards. This reversal of the Empress' fortunes resulted in Stephen's release, after he was exchanged for Robert. The next few years, until 1148, saw a period of civil war in England, often called The Anarchy, when neither Matilda nor Stephen controlled the country.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{portrayed as}} an {{imaginary}} {{character in a}} schizophrenia storyline, Rae was later revealed to be real <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>arrived</b> to study in Hollyoaks. She was central to a controversial suicide storyline, and {{was part of a}} love triangle with Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson) and Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan), which left her pregnant by Ste. She miscarried during an argument with Brendan and subsequently feuded with him; Barlow praised her character for being {{one of the few who}} dared to oppose the Hollyoaks villain. Rae was originally characterised as a chav with a feisty persona, but underwent a transformation when she attempted to embrace domestic life with Ste. During series four of the post-watershed spin-off Hollyoaks Later, Rae was murdered by a serial killer, Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle). The late broadcast slot allowed an explicit depiction of her death. Barlow hoped that Rae would be remembered for her strong-willed nature, and that her exit would be considered one of the best in the programme's history.|$|E
