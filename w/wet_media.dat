40|$|There is no {{dearth of}} {{published}} data concerning direct evaporative cooling, especially concerning the <b>wetted</b> <b>media</b> {{used in this}} technique. In spite of the data abundance, {{the lack of a}} comprehensive review of <b>wetted</b> <b>media</b> with potential use for inlet air pre-cooling of Natural Draft Dry Cooling Towers (NDDCTs) triggered the motivation of this paper. This paper reviews the <b>wetted</b> <b>media</b> with potentiality in the pre-cooling application of NDDCTs in terms of wetted medium types, mathematical models, performance studies and empirical relations. A method to compare <b>wetted</b> <b>media</b> in terms of the balance between cooling potential and pressure drop is proposed and validated. This method should be useful for comparative evaluation of wetted medium types or at least to differentiate between good and bad medium types. The medium cost, the service life, the type of process to be cooled, environmental conditions, water quality, space availability, locations and economic requirements are essential considerations, and some significant trade-offs have to be made during medium selection. A framework for medium selection is presented and {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} different medium types are summarized to provide a starting point for such selection. The empirical correlations appeared in the literature are synthesized to better correlate and compare the test data of <b>wetted</b> <b>media</b> and subsequently to provide prerequisite information for performance prediction. Controversies concerning wetted medium studies are discussed, and finally the gaps related to wetted medium studies are articulated...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of natural draft dry cooling towers (NDDCTs) {{can be improved}} by wetted-medium evaporative pre-cooling. However, the pre-cooling benefit is season dependent and is significantly affected by <b>wetted</b> <b>media.</b> To further investigate the effect of wetted medium type on pre-cooling performance, the current study simulates a pre-cooled NDDCT using two typical types of <b>wetted</b> <b>media,</b> i. e., film (Cellulose 7060 and PVC 1200) and trickle (Trickle 125 and Trickle 100). A MATLAB program was developed and was validated against published data. The model was then used to carry out case study of a 120 m-high NDDCT pre-cooled using the selected <b>wetted</b> <b>media</b> with fixed thickness of 300 mm. Both the medium performance and pre-cooled NDDCT performance were compared to recommend the characteristics of <b>wetted</b> <b>media</b> promising for evaporative pre-cooling. Simulation finds that the media with high or low cooling efficiencies and pressure drops are not promising for the studied pre-cooling case while those media with middle cooling efficiencies and pressure drops intend to produce much performance enhancement and Cellulose 7060 is a representative of such kind of medium. For the 120 m-high NDDCT, the wetted-medium pre-cooling can raise the heat rejection rate of the tower without pre-cooling from 45 MW to 92 MW, 76 MW, 68 MW and 65 MW by Cellulose 7060, PVC 1200, Trickle 125 and Trickle 100, respectively at ambient temperature of 50 °C and humidity of 20 %...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simulation study on pre-cooling of inlet air using Munters media {{to enhance the}} performance of a Natural Draft Dry Cooling Tower (NDDCT) on hot and dry days. The ambient humidity was kept constant at 30 % while the ambient temperature ranged from 10 ° to 50 °C during simulation. Three Munters media (CELdek 7060, CELdek 7090 and CELdek 5090), each with three thicknesses, were employed to pre-cool the tower inlet air. Results show that NDDCT can benefit from pre-cooling with <b>wetted</b> <b>media</b> when the ambient air is hot and dry. The trade-off between the air pressure drop across the media and the benefit of evaporative pre-cooling of the inlet air was also examined. It was found that there is a critical ambient temperature below which pre-cooling application does not benefit NDDCT performance. The value of this critical temperature {{is a function of the}} tower design and the selection of <b>wetted</b> <b>media.</b> Amongst the studied media, only the pre-cooling with 0. 10 m and 0. 15 m CELdek 7060 is to be useful in the studied case.

40|$|We {{propose a}} simple phenomenological model for <b>wet</b> {{granular}} <b>media</b> {{to take into}} account many particle interaction through liquid in the funicular state as well as two-body cohesive force by a liquid bridge in the pendular state. In the <b>wet</b> granular <b>media</b> with small liquid content, liquid forms a bridge at each contact point, which induces two-body cohesive force due to the surface tension. As the liquid content increases, some liquid bridges merge, and more than two grains interact through a single liquid cluster.

As the liquid content increases, the number of grains that interact through the liquid increases, but the liquid-gas interface may decrease when liquid clusters are formed.
