5|$|In {{addition}} to epitheliomuscular, nerve and interstitial cells, the inward-facing gastroderm ("stomach skin") contains gland cells that secrete digestive enzymes.

5|$|It is {{typically}} nocturnal (active at night), though activity {{may also be}} observed during the day. It generally rests or ruminates during the day. Territories are marked with dung. The reduced size of the preorbital glands, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> for scent-marking, could indicate that marking behaviour is not very prominent in this antelope.|$|E

5|$|Juniper Networks {{originally}} {{focused on}} core routers, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> by {{internet service providers}} (ISPs) to perform IP address lookups and direct internet traffic. Through the acquisition of Unisphere in 2002, the company entered the market for edge routers, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> by ISPs to route internet traffic to individual consumers. Juniper Networks entered the IT security market with its own JProtect security toolkit in 2003 before acquiring security company NetScreen Technologies the following year. It entered the enterprise segment in the early 2000s, which accounted for one-third of revenues by 2005. As of 2014, Juniper {{has been focused on}} developing new software-defined networking products. However, in 2016, the company encountered some controversy for allegedly putting backdoors into its ScreenOS products.|$|E

5|$|Another kashrut {{challenge}} {{which the}} bakery overcame {{in the early}} 1950s concerned the ability to produce fresh bread for sale on Sunday mornings after the plant had been closed for Shabbat in accordance with Jewish law. Normally dough takes four to six hours to rise, but the bakery acquired a mixer made by Tweedy of Burnley, England, which could produce dough in only two hours, thus allowing the bakery to bake bread on Saturday night in time for Sunday-morning deliveries. Today Angel Bakeries owns nine such mixers, five of <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> in its Jerusalem plant.|$|E
