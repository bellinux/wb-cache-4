5|$|In New York, Sanders {{encountered}} {{a different form}} of racism. At Montefiore Hospital, where she performed her clinical training, black nurses were given worse assignments than white nurses. White patients sometimes were abusive toward black nurses. While the racial climate in New York <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> situation in Alabama, Sanders frequently wondered whether she had merely exchanged Jim Crow racism for a more genteel prejudice.|$|E

5|$|The B-52D was a {{dedicated}} long-range bomber without a reconnaissance option. The Big Belly modifications allowed the B-52D to carry heavy loads of conventional bombs for carpet bombing over Vietnam, while the Rivet Rambler modification added the Phase V ECM systems, which <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> systems used on most later B-52s. Because of these upgrades and its long range capabilities, the D model was used more extensively in Vietnam {{than any other}} model. Aircraft assigned to Vietnam were painted in a camouflage colour scheme with black bellies to defeat searchlights.|$|E
5|$|The {{first episode}} premiered at a {{screening}} on September 19, 2016, with the season then airing for 22 episodes on ABC, from September 20, 2016 until May 16, 2017. The premiere debuted to 3.58 million viewers, down from previous season premieres but {{average for the}} series. Critical response to the season was positive, with many feeling that each pod <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> last and in particular praising the visual effects and tone of Ghost Rider, the writing and acting for LMD, and the character development and political commentary explored during Agents of Hydra. The season saw series low viewership, but was still considered to have solved ABC's problem during its timeslot, and the show was renewed for a fifth season on May 11, 2017.|$|E
5|$|A study {{published}} by Mulungushi University indicated that age distortions {{were found in}} census data and a tendency of age heaping with terminal digits of ‘0’ and ‘5’ were common. It also reported that gender differences existed in age reporting in Zambia with more number of males reporting their ages wrongly. But the report acknowledged the difficulties in data collection and stated {{that the quality of}} data collection <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> previous census enumerations. Another {{study published}} in the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health journal indicated that the census reported very high adult female mortality, particularly a high pregnancy-related mortality in both rural and urban areas twelve months prior to the census. The evaluation of population age, age-at-death, live births were reported to contain data errors. Another study by Demographic Research indicated that the data of people aged above 80 was not accurately captured in most sub-Saharan countries, which prevented research on age-related health ailments and other socio-economic characteristics.|$|E

5|$|With Benfica {{committed}} to the league race, March was a critical month for the club's aspirations. Their first game was a visit to Aves to play Desportivo de Aves. The home team {{had an opportunity to}} lead with a penalty kick in the 36th minute, but Quim stopped Hernâni Borges's shot. In the second half, Nuno Gomes scored the match's only goal when he answered a cross from Nélson. Santos said the result <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> performance. On the next Thursday, Benfica played Paris St-Germain at the Parc des Princes. Benfica scored first with header from Simão in the tenth minute, but PSG reacted with two goals in five minutes before half-time. The score remained unchanged, giving Benfica a one-goal disadvantage. On 12 March, Benfica met União de Leiria at home for match-day 21. Benfica won 2–0 with goals from Simão and Petit, keeping up the pressure on Porto.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, Roma {{slaves were}} divided into three categories. The {{smallest}} was owned by the hospodars, and went by the Romanian-language name of ţigani domneşti ("Gypsies belonging to the lord"). The two other categories comprised ţigani mănăstireşti ("Gypsies belonging to the monasteries"), who were the property of Romanian Orthodox and Greek Orthodox monasteries, and ţigani boiereşti ("Gypsies belonging to the boyars"), who were enslaved by the category of landowners. The status of the ţigani domneşti <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> one of the slaves held by boyars or the monasteries and many slaves given by the Prince to private owners or to monasteries ran away and joined the communities of the Prince's slaves.|$|E
25|$|The {{commission}} {{released its}} final report on December 15, 1998. It documented ambiguities and confusion {{in both the}} French and UN responses. Regarding Opération Turquoise, it regretted that the intervention took place too late, though it noted that this <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> non-response from the UN and the opposition by the U.S. and U.K. governments to such a response. The report documented mixed success at disarming the Rwandan Army and militias, but a definite and systematic attempt (though not fast enough as far as then-General Paul Kagame of the opposing RPF forces was concerned, in documentation of the latter's communications with the French forces).|$|E
25|$|Capirossi {{returned}} to the 500cc championship for 2000, and remained there through its evolution to the 990cc and eventually, 800cc four-stroke MotoGP era. He won at his home race and finished 7th overall, one point behind Carlos Checa. The 2001 season <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> year before, although without a win during the year. Also {{it was the last}} season for the 500cc class, but for the 2002 season Capirossi found that he would ride inferior bikes from 2001. It was a less competitive year, hampered by a wrist injury in the seventh race of the season when he missed the chicane and turned from the track. He was not given access to Honda's four-stroke machine in late 2002 when teammate Alex Barros was, as he was already to leave the team.|$|E

25|$|Although most slaves had {{lives that}} were very {{restricted}} {{in terms of their}} movements and agency, exceptions existed to virtually every generalization; for instance, there were also slaves who had considerable freedom in their daily lives: slaves allowed to rent out their labor and who might live independently of their master in cities, slaves who employed white workers, and slave doctors who treated upper-class white patients. After 1820, in response to the inability to import new slaves from Africa and in part to abolitionist criticism, some slaveholders improved the living conditions of their slaves, to encourage them to be productive and to try to prevent escapes. It was part of a paternalistic approach in the antebellum era that was encouraged by ministers trying to use Christianity to improve the treatment of slaves. Slaveholders published articles in southern agricultural journals to share best practices in treatment and management of slaves; they intended to show that their system <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> living conditions of northern industrial workers.|$|E
25|$|On August 13, {{the mine}} owners offered {{to raise the}} minimum daily wage to $3 for any month in which the price of silver was $0.75 or more per troy ounce. This would not have {{resulted}} in an immediate pay raise, because the price of silver was lower. Nevertheless, nearly two months into the strike and lockout, the offer seemed attractive {{to some of the}} strikers. The majority were already $3-per day workers, and had nothing personally to gain from the strike. Even some of the $2.50-per day miners considered that $2.50 <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> nothing they earned while on strike. But when union members showed up for the special meeting called on August 17 to discuss the management offer, they found the union hall locked. The union leadership had abruptly and without notice cancelled the meeting. Some union members saw this as proof that the leadership intended to continue the strike regardless of the opinion of the rank and file.|$|E
25|$|Publication bias {{is cited}} as a concern in the reviews of {{randomized}} controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture. A 1998 review of studies on acupuncture found that trials originating in China, Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan were uniformly favourable to acupuncture, as were ten out of eleven studies conducted in Russia. A 2011 assessment {{of the quality of}} RCTs on TCM, including acupuncture, concluded that the methodological quality of most such trials (including randomization, experimental control, and blinding) was generally poor, particularly for trials published in Chinese journals (though the quality of acupuncture trials <b>was</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> trials testing TCM remedies). The study also found that trials published in non-Chinese journals tended to be of higher quality. Chinese authors use more Chinese studies, which have been demonstrated to be uniformly positive. A 2012 review of 88 systematic reviews of acupuncture published in Chinese journals found that less than half of these reviews reported testing for publication bias, and that the majority of these reviews were published in journals with impact factors of zero.|$|E
