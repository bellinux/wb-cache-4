5|$|A bulk carrier's {{design is}} largely {{defined by the}} cargo it <b>will</b> <b>carry.</b> <b>The</b> cargo's density, also known as its stowage factor, is the key factor. Densities for common bulk cargoes vary from 0.6tons per cubic meter for light grains to 3tons per cubic meter for iron ore.|$|E

Traveling to the Hong Kong base, the Shatterdome, Raleigh is introduced to Mako Mori, director of the Jaeger restoration program and Pentecost’s adoptive daughter. Four Jaegers remain in operation – the refurbished Gipsy Danger, the Russian Cherno Alpha, the Chinese Crimson Typhoon, and the Australian Striker Eureka that <b>will</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> bomb, and piloted by father and son Herc and Chuck Hansen.|$|E
5|$|Male orangutans play {{almost no}} role in raising the young. Females {{do most of the}} caring and socializing of the young. A female often has an older {{offspring}} with her to help in socializing the infant. Infant orangutans are completely dependent on their mothers for {{the first two years of}} their lives. The mother <b>will</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> infant during travelling, as well as feed it and sleep with it in the same night nest. For the first four months, the infant is carried on its belly and never relieves physical contact. In the following months, the time an infant spends with its mother decreases.|$|E

5|$|Months {{before each}} Games, the Olympic Flame is lit in Olympia in a {{ceremony}} that reflects ancient Greek rituals. A female performer, acting as a priestess, ignites a torch by placing it inside a parabolic mirror which focuses the sun's rays; she then lights the torch of the first relay bearer, thus initiating the Olympic torch relay that <b>will</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> flame to the host city's Olympic stadium, where it {{plays an important role}} in the opening ceremony. Though the flame has been an Olympic symbol since 1928, the torch relay was only introduced at the 1936 Summer Games to promote the Third Reich.|$|E
5|$|Like the FIFA World Cup, the Recopa Sudamericana is {{sponsored}} {{by a group of}} multinational corporations. Unlike the premier football tournament forementioned, the competition uses a single, main sponsor; it is currently primarily sponsored by Banco Santander, one of the largest banks in the world. The deal running for a period of three years began with the 2012 edition. As the main sponsor of the tournament, the competition <b>will</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> name of the bank. Thus, the competition is known officially as the '"Copa Santander Libertadores'". The first primary sponsor of the competition was Fox Sports Latinoamérica, a Latin American cable television network focusing on sports-related programming including live and pre-recorded event telecasts, sports talk shows, and other original programmings. The sponsorship was only for the 2005 edition of the competition, being known officially as '"Fox Sports Recopa Sudamericana"'. The second primary sponsor was Visa, an American multinational financial services corporation. The deal ran for a period of 3 years which began with the 2006 edition. As the main sponsor of the tournament, the competition carried the name of the corporation. Thus, the competition was known officially as '"Recopa Visa Sudamericana"'.|$|E

25|$|The {{framework}} is generic {{in that it}} can be used to classify the descriptive representations of any physical object as well as conceptual objects such as enterprises. It is also recursive in {{that it can be}} used to analyze the architectural composition of itself. Although the framework <b>will</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> relation from one column to the other, it is still a fundamentally structural representation of the enterprise and not a flow representation.|$|E
25|$|Gender {{disparity}} is also {{visible in}} the education of children with disabilities, a study in the 1990s revealed that only 37% of disabled females are literate compared to 57% for males. A reason for this situation is the cultural notion that the male <b>will</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> family name while the female will marry. Also the option of street begging by young disabled girls in order to earn income can inhibit their attendance of classes.|$|E

In some states such North Carolina and New Mexico these pharmacist clinicians are given collaborative prescriptive and diagnostic authority. In 2011 the board of Pharmaceutical Specialties approved ambulatory care pharmacy practice as a separate board certification. The official designation for pharmacists who pass the ambulatory care pharmacy specialty certification exam will be Board Certified Ambulatory Care Pharmacist and these pharmacists <b>will</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> initials BCACP.|$|E

25|$|Fine {{structure}} cooling: The {{process of}} fine structure cooling is dominant in most {{regions of the}} Interstellar Medium, except regions of hot gas and regions deep in molecular clouds. It occurs most efficiently with abundant atoms having fine structure levels close to the fundamental level such as: CII and OI in the neutral medium and OII, OIII, NII, NIII, NeII and NeIII in HII regions. Collisions will excite these atoms to higher levels, and they will eventually de-excite through photon emission, which <b>will</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> energy out of the region.|$|E

Jane Goodall has described chimpanzees as exhibiting mournful behavior toward the loss of a group member with silence and by showing more attention to it. And they will often continue grooming it and stay close to the carcass until the group must move on without it. Another notable example is Koko, a gorilla that uses sign language, who expressed sadness and even described sadness about the death of her pet cat, All Ball.|$|E
