25|$|The {{very first}} modern {{aquarium}} {{made of glass}} {{was developed in the}} 19th century by Robert Warrington. During the Victorian age, glass aquariums commonly had slate or steel bottoms, which allowed them to be heated underneath by an open-flame heat source. These aquariums had the glass panels attached <b>with</b> <b>metal</b> <b>frames</b> and sealed with putty. Metal-framed aquariums were still available until the mid-1960s, when the modern, silicone-sealed style replaced them. Acrylic aquariums first became available to the public in the 1970s. Laminated glass is sometimes used, which combines the advantages of both glass and acrylic.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Target Corporation {{agreed to}} reduce their sales on all {{materials}} containing polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Testers found toxic lead and phthalates and large amounts of PVC in toys, lunchboxes, baby bibs, jewelry, garden hoses, mini blinds, Christmas trees, and electronics. Several {{studies have shown that}} chemicals in vinyl chloride can cause serious health problems for children and adults. The University of Illinois Medical Center in Chicago states that people who use products containing PVC can become exposed with harmful toxic phthalates and lead, which eventually can become a big contributor with dioxins. Lois Gibbs, executive director of the Center for Health, Environment, and Justice, stated, [...] "Target is doing the right thing by moving away from PVC and switching to safer alternatives." [...] Other companies reducing the PVC on their shelves include Walmart, Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson, Nike, and Apple. Target stores have been taking environmental measures by reusing materials within their stores and recycling products such as broken hangers, cardboard, and rechargeable batteries. Target is beginning to reduce energy use with energy-efficient storefronts and reducing waste with recycling programs. All Target stores in the United States use plastic carts <b>with</b> <b>metal</b> <b>frames.</b> In mid-2006, Target took it a step further when it began introducing a newer cart design made entirely of plastic. It also uses the same design in its hand-use baskets.|$|E

50|$|The Tumlare (lit. Porpoise) is a {{class of}} canoe-sterned (or 'double-ended') yacht {{designed}} by Knud Reimers. The design dates from the early 1930s (1933 from a majority of sources; No. 1, Aibe was built the next year for Bengt Kinde). The Tumlaren is 8.30 m overall; the design was strongly endorsed as a 'very advanced type' by Uffa Fox who was especially interested in the composite method of construction employed, <b>with</b> <b>metal</b> <b>frames</b> interspersed between the timber ones.|$|E
50|$|The brick section {{comprises}} a repetitive {{arrangement of}} bays divided by engaged pilasters and {{is divided into}} the refined sugar store and pan house at the southern end, and the cistern and char house at the northern end. An externally visible brick fire wall divides the building into five and eight bays, between the refined sugar store and the pan house. Twelve-paned arched windows <b>with</b> <b>metal</b> <b>frames</b> are located in each bay on each floor, apart from where modifications have been made.|$|E

5000|$|Around 1900, Charles Mayer {{left the}} {{insurance}} business and {{became involved in}} real estate development. One of his projects was the Park Flats, which he built with numerous architectural innovations. Among these features were large bay windows <b>with</b> <b>metal</b> <b>frames,</b> two belt courses per story, and multiple colors of bricks. Constructed with the plan of a rectangle, Mayer's finished building includes elements of stone and stucco. [...] It combines multiple elements of early twentieth century Neoclassical architecture with other features of the newly emergent Chicago School.|$|E
5000|$|Around {{the start}} of the 21st century, {{companies}} began offering [...] "portable garages" [...] in the United States. Typically, these garages are made of metal and do not connect to the house or other structure, much like the garage built before 1950. Garages are also produced as composite fabric garages <b>with</b> <b>metal</b> <b>frames</b> that are lightweight and portable garage compared to traditional brick-and-mortar or metal garage structures. Many homeowner's associations frown upon the installation of these nonconforming buildings, but still, their popularity is increasing.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} options when using seed traps {{based on the}} {{specific}} need for the project. Seed traps {{can be made in}} different sizes, shapes, and of different material. Traditionally, seed traps are wooden frames with a screened bottom. Traps <b>with</b> <b>metal</b> <b>frames</b> have also been used. Additionally, funnel-shaped traps that are set above the soil or leveled at the ground, traps with screen or cloth bags, traps with water or soil to germinate them, plastic buckets, or traps with sticky surfaces have been used.|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s the {{northern}} building was rented by Andronicos Stylianou who operated a successful barber shop from the premises for thirty years. At {{the time he}} was to move in the owners were required by the Cairns City Council to replace a timber stud frame wall with horizontal boarding. This wall had windows which were removed at the same time. This was replaced with cement block wall with window openings and louvres in the block wall <b>with</b> <b>metal</b> <b>frames.</b> At the time, the roof ceiling was supported and the corrugated roof replaced. While he built an internal wall to assist business operations, this was later removed after he had left.|$|E

5000|$|The airport {{concept is}} {{described}} as [...] "garden within the airport" [...] or [...] "airport in the garden", as tropical decorative and flower plants fill the spaces between corridors, waiting and boarding pavilions. The boarding pavilions demonstrate local Indonesian vernacular architecture, particularly the roof, in the Javanese stepped-roof pendopo and joglo style. The interior design displays the diversity of Indonesian art and culture, with ethnic decorative elements taken from wooden carvings of Java, Bali, Sumatra, Dayak, Toraja to Papua. Another example is the railings of stairs, doors and gates, which show the kala-makara (giant head and mythical fish-elephant creature) theme typical in ancient Indonesian temples such as Borobudur. Terminal 3, however, has a different architectural style—unlike the ethnic-inspired Indonesian vernacular architecture of terminals 1 and 2, terminal 3 uses the contemporary modern style of large glass windows <b>with</b> <b>metal</b> <b>frames</b> and columns.|$|E
50|$|On 21 February 1835, the Théâtre de la Gaîté, on the Boulevard du Temple, was {{completely}} destroyed by fire. His last play there was Bijou ou l’Enfant de Paris ("Bijou, or the Child of Paris"): apparently firework effects were being tested during a dress rehearsal. The Théâtre de la Gaîté would however be reconstructed very rapidly, <b>with</b> <b>metal</b> <b>frames,</b> to reopen on 19 November, the reconstruction being overseen by Bernard Léon {{who had only}} just bought the venue for 500 000 francs. (Nevertheless it would merge with L’Ambigu only ten years later.) Pixerécourt won the day in court and avoided ruin. Although {{he was not the}} theatre's owner, he had lost an immense quantity of properties and scenery (estimated as worth 300,000 francs) which contributed greatly to the success of his dramatic presentations. The stress of the accident greatly damaged his health. Already a victim of kidneystones and gout, he had his first attack of apoplexy, and his eyesight began to fail.|$|E
5000|$|In 1928, the French Minister of Labor, Louis Loucheur, won {{the passage}} of a French law on public housing, calling for the {{construction}} of 260,000 new housing units within five years. Le Corbusier immediately began to design a new type of modular housing unit, which he called the Maison Loucheur, which would be suitable for the project. These units were 45 m2 in size, made <b>with</b> <b>metal</b> <b>frames,</b> and were designed to be mass-produced and then transported to the site, where they would be inserted into frameworks of steel and stone; The government insisted on stone walls to win the support of local building contractors. The standardisation of apartment buildings was the essence of what Le Corbusier termed the Ville Radieuse or [...] "radiant city", in a new book which published in 1935. The Radiant City was similar to his earlier Contemporary City and Plan Voisin, with the difference that residences would be assigned by family size, rather than by income and social position. In his 1935 book, he developed his ideas for a new kind of city, where the principle functions; heavy industry, manufacturing, habitation and commerce, would be clearly separated into their own neighbourhoods, carefully planned and designed. However, before any units could be built, World War II intervened.|$|E

The three-bay exterior is framed by a two-storey gold and blue mosaic with gold lettering at the top. There is a dado with gold Masonic symbols, and there are Stars of David and chimera-like figures. Below the mosaic frame, a two-storey glazed bronze screen <b>with</b> <b>metal</b> <b>framing</b> leads to a recessed doorway. The inside is Art Deco in style.|$|R
50|$|Between 1918 and 1939 {{aircraft}} technology developed very rapidly. In 1918 most aircraft were biplanes {{with wooden}} frames, canvas skins, wire rigging and air-cooled engines.

40|$|A new {{trucking}} {{method of}} liquids, called the Softtank system, {{has recently been}} developed and given attentions to improve conventional trucking method. The system {{is equipped with a}} size-free flexible bag with a pressure-resistant watertight zipper. It could be instaued on common trucks <b>with</b> <b>metal</b> <b>frames</b> to prevent agitation of the liquid. Unique characteristics of this system are as follows: 1) Load volume of liquid is free. 2) Consolidated service is available. 3) The system can be folded into smaller size, so that other goods can be loaded on the return trip. 4) Attached zipper makes cleaning of the inside of the bags easy and the sanitation task become independent from the drivers' responsibility. 5) It is recyclable for several hulldred times. By using raw cow milks, the Softtank system was compared with a conventional trucking method on the quality control including sanitation, temperature, and bacteria counts. In the summer of 2001, test trials were performed five times. The average of the transportation distance and duration were about 600 km and 19 hours, and provided the following results: 1) Just before loading the milk, the cleanness of the containers was tested with a commercial ATP detection kit. The Softtank containers were sufficiently clean at each trial, but the test detected microorganisms of contamination {{in some parts of the}} container of the tanktrucks. The contamination diminished by the fifth trial. The cause of the contamination of the tanktruck appeared to be a lack of explicit sanitation specifications to the sanitation operators. 2) Increased temperature of the milk during trucking was observed at the upper part of the container of tanktrucks. Since the increase was not depended on the outdoor temperature, it might be caused by the increased temperature of head space(upper part) of container, which is caused by the direct rays of the sun. 3) No increase of microorganisms was found throughout the trucking trials. 4) Fat content of the milk transported by the tanktrucks was increased about 0. 1 %. This was thought that some of fat globules were disrupted by churning and large sized fat globules (cream) were produced during the trucking by the tanktrucks. This phenomenon was not observed in the Softtank system. These results indicate that the Softtank system is a superior trucking method to achieve better sanitation of the containers and maintain higher quality of raw cow milk...|$|E
