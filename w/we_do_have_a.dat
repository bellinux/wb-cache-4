500|$|Humble was {{expected}} {{to return to the}} Browns after his discharge from the military in 1952. In a surprise move, however, Brown traded him before the season to the Dallas Texans for fullback Sherman Howard. The trade was unexpected because Cleveland's other guards, including Gaudio and Alex Agase, were getting older and nearing retirement. [...] "I'm sure we'll be all right at the guard position," [...] Brown said at the time. [...] "But <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> definite fullback problem." [...] Humble played one season for the Texans before retiring. Dallas had a 1–11 record in 1952.|$|E
500|$|During {{a conference}} call with journalists, actor John Noble called [...] "6:02 AM EST" [...] and the next two episodes of the third season an [...] "epic trilogy". He {{elaborated}} [...] "All year we've been heading toward the fact that {{there seems to be an}} inevitable conflict between the two universes. And we've gotten to know the people on both sides now, so we now bring it to a conclusion starting with '6:02.' By the next episode we start to deal with the issue because our earth starts to deteriorate. Events start to happen here which indicate that our world is degrading. And so everyone has to move into another gear and say, 'Okay, this problem is not going to go away. It's now affecting our side. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> machine which we believe can assist in the resolution of this problem.' And so the episode basically deals with the lead-up in the first part of that trilogy, leading up to the use of that machine." [...] In the same interview, Noble called the episode's title very critical to the series, stating [...] "That time frame plays through the three episodes. Very important to remember as we get to the finale, that time frame." ...|$|E
2500|$|Churchill {{wrote to}} a friend: [...] "I have never heard such a squalid {{confession}} from a public man as Baldwin offered us yesterday". In 1935 Baldwin wrote to J. C. C. Davidson (in a letter now lost) saying of Churchill: [...] "If {{there is going to}} be a war – and no one can say that there is not – we must keep him fresh to be our war Prime Minister". Thomas Dugdale also claimed Baldwin said to him: [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> war, Winston must be Prime Minister. If he is in [...] now we shan't be able to engage in that war as a united nation". The General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, Walter Citrine, recalled a conversation he had had with Baldwin on 5 April 1943: [...] "Baldwin thought his [...] political recovery was marvellous. He, personally, had always thought that if war came Winston would be the right man for the job".|$|E

2500|$|In 1983, {{there was}} a talk of a solo album with work done again with Vanda and Young. Wright said the album would best be {{described}} as [...] "classy rock 'n' roll", and the songs were about [...] "a wide spectrum of all the experiences I've been through". He said the love songs he had were optimistic. The interview gives a good idea as to how Wright worked in the studio with Vanda and Young:;"Well, it's a three way thing. [...] They'll sit down and say 'we've got this sort of song' and we'll discuss how we'll approach it. Obviously after this long <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very strong bond. I've written a couple of songs but since they're far better at it than I am, I'll let them handle that." [...] According to the Juke Magazine article it was [...] "due for release later that year" [...] however, this never happened.|$|E

6000|$|... "Sir Thomas {{would not}} have had it any other way," [...] said Lady Tringle, with a little severity, feeling that Lucy's accord had hardly been as generous as it should be. But she {{recovered}} herself quickly, remembering how much it was that Ayala was to get, how much that Lucy was to lose. [...] "But, my dear, we shall see you very often, you know.

6000|$|... 'Doctor,' {{he would}} say--'doctor is a foul word. It {{should not be}} used to ladies. It implies disease. I remark it, as a flaw in our civilisation, that we have not the proper horror of disease. Now I, for my part, have washed my hands of it; I have renounced my laureation; I am no doctor; I am only a worshipper of the true goddess Hygieia. Ah, believe me, it is she who has the cestus! And here, in this exiguous hamlet, has she placed her shrine: here she dwells and lavishes her gifts; here I walk with her in the early morning, and she shows me how strong she has made the peasants, how {{fruitful}} she has made the fields, how the trees grow up tall and comely under her eyes, and the fishes in the river become clean and agile at her presence.--Rheumatism!' he would cry, on some malapert interruption, 'O, yes, I believe <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> little rheumatism. That could hardly be avoided, you know, on a river. And of course the place stands a little low; and the meadows are marshy, there's no doubt. But, my dear sir, look at Bourron! Bourron stands high. Bourron is close to the forest; plenty of ozone there, you would say. Well, compared with Gretz, Bourron is a perfect shambles.' ...|$|E
