50|$|The Bhakti {{movement}} of Hinduism built its theosophy around two concepts of Brahman—Nirguna and Saguna. Nirguna Brahman was {{the concept of}} the Ultimate Reality as formless, without attributes or quality. Saguna Brahman, in contrast, <b>was</b> <b>envisioned</b> <b>and</b> <b>developed</b> as with form, attributes and quality. The two had parallels in the ancient panthestic unmanifest and theistic manifest traditions, respectively, and traceable to Arjuna-Krishna dialogue in the Bhagavad Gita. It is the same Brahman, but viewed from two perspectives, one from Nirguni knowledge-focus and other from Saguni love-focus, united as Krishna in the Gita. Nirguna bhakta's poetry were Jnana-shrayi, or had roots in knowledge. Saguna bhakta's poetry were Prema-shrayi, or with roots in love. In Bhakti, the emphasis is reciprocal love and devotion, where the devotee loves God, and God loves the devotee.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{an approach to}} the design of interactive physical environments influenced by geographical conceptions of what they term place. Recent developments in the field of Ubiquitous Computing allow designers to embed computational elements and interactive components within the spaces we inhabit in our daily lives, thus changing their character and the possibilities for action they offer. In order to design such technologies in an effective way, we need to understand how people conceive of, and live in, physical spaces. We believe that the notion of ‘place’ –a concept of space that includes the way it is experienced by people- is a useful notion on the basis of which to frame an investigation of these dynamics. In this chapter we will discuss the concept of place and its implications for design, and we will relate our approach to the current debate within HCI, CSCW and Interaction Design on the concepts of space and place. As an illustration of our framework, we describe a design case study, where an interactive museum exhibition <b>was</b> <b>envisioned</b> <b>and</b> <b>developed</b> according to our perspective...|$|E
40|$|Aflatoxins {{are highly}} toxic cancer causing Aspergillus {{metabolites}} that cause immune-system suppression, growth retardation, cancer, {{and death in}} both humans and domestic animals. Aflatoxin-producing species have considerable intraspecific variability and the species that causes most aflatoxin contamination ofcrops, Aspergillusflavus, varies widely in aflatoxin production with some strains producing no aflatoxins. Biocontrol strategies to reduce aflatoxin contamination have been developed utilising strains ofAspergillusflavus, which do not produce aflatoxins to competitively exclude aflatoxin producers. In commercial practice, these atoxigenic strains are applied during crop development on a fungal food source that fuels initial reproduction and dispersal of the biocontrol agent. Although applications alter the composition ofAspergillusflavus communities associated with crops and, as a result, reduce crop aflatoxin content, both crop infection by Aspergillusflavus and the quantity ofAspergillusflavus on the crop at harvest are no different in treated and untreated crops. Long-term influences ofatoxigenic strain treatments have led to efforts to develop area-wide aflatoxin management programs. It is within such programs that the greatest potential for atoxigenic strain use may reside. However, for optimal benefits, improved methods for utilising atoxigenic strains must <b>be</b> <b>envisioned</b> <b>and</b> <b>developed.</b> It <b>is</b> likely these will include methods that simultaneously utilise multiple strains...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{suggests}} a reference model for PHM processes that aids the customer of PHM {{in developing a}} business case for adopting PHM {{in his or her}} supply chain. Various PHM systems have <b>been</b> <b>envisioned</b> <b>and</b> <b>developed</b> in order to produce a prognosis of system or component behavior by collecting physical data from some section of a system, analyzing it and reporting the results to the entity that benefits from it, notably the supply chain that manages the components and receives the resulting cost benefit from PHM. All these systems have varying configurations that involve the collection of different types of data in different ways, the analysis of varying types of physical behavior and have different types of customers (different supply chain configurations). The customer needs to include the cost and complexity of the PHM system in his or her business model but has no formal standard to determine bounds on the complexity of the PHM system. Just as there are reference stacks for service-oriented architectures, this paper proposes a functional stack for PHM that can become a reference architecture for developing or purchasing a PHM system for an organization. The stack of PHM services ranges from the data acquisition layer through analysis functions to supply chain decision support services. 1...|$|R

40|$|Today, postsecondary {{engineering}} education stands {{perched on the}} edge of transformation. A precursor to impending change is national recognition that nontraditional students—adults and working students with socioeconomic backgrounds not currently well-represented in {{engineering education}}—possess untapped potential to improve the diversity as well as increase the size of the U. S. engineering workforce. To support nontraditional student participation in engineering, a qualitative investigation was undertaken to examine the ways in which nontraditional engineering undergraduates defined and experienced success during their engineering education. It is thought that, through a deeper, richer understanding of the ways in which the nontraditional engineering undergraduates overcome barriers and experience success, newer, more impactful alternative pathways that assist nontraditional students in becoming part of the engineering profession can <b>be</b> <b>envisioned</b> <b>and</b> <b>developed.</b> During this study, 14 nontraditional student participants were purposefully sampled from the population of undergraduates who participated in a distance-delivered, alternative engineering transfer program offered at a western, land-grant, public university between 2009 - 2015. Qualitative data from in-depth interviews were used to co-develop life history–style narratives for each of the participants. Completed narratives chronologically ordered and richly described the participants’ experiences leading up to, happening during, and occurring after their engineering education. Narrative analysis revealed that the nontraditional student participants viewed their own educational success contextually, relationally, and in terms of their long-term goals for social mobility through engineering careers. Additionally, the distance-delivered alternative engineering transfer program was seen to promote their educational success in three ways: a) working to promote long-range career goals through job market signaling, b) enabling academic bootstrapping in an adult learning environment, and c) maintaining connection to community-based support through place.

40|$|Abstract — Networks of low-power, low-cost, {{and widely}} {{distributed}} wireless sensor nodes <b>are</b> being <b>envisioned</b> <b>and</b> <b>developed</b> for many military applications including surveillance and localization. However, due to energy and communication constraints, combinations of static nodes (such as unattended ground sensors (UGS)) and mobile nodes (such as robotic ground vehicles (RGV) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)) {{are being used}} to expand or fill in coverage areas and reduce energy costs. A multi-chaser target tracking scenario is developed where mobile nodes, or chasers, use information provided by static nodes to infer the position of an intruder in the sensor grid. In large-scale sensor networks with mobile access, the communication range of static nodes may be limited by terrain and signal transmission energy. A drop-box static sensor architecture is developed to aid data propagation in such limited range networks. Chasers will “drop off ” previously collected information about the target and retrieve new information stored in the static sensors. An algorithm is presented which takes advantage of this particular architecture. It is used to demonstrate that the drop-box nature of the static nodes improves performance. I...|$|R

40|$|Background New {{technologies}} {{constitute an}} important cost-driver in healthcare, but the dynamics {{that lead to}} their emergence remains poorly understood from a health policy standpoint. The goal {{of this paper is}} to clarify how entrepreneurs, investors, and regulatory agencies influence the value of emerging health technologies. Methods Our 5 -year qualitative research program examined the processes through which new health technologies <b>were</b> <b>envisioned,</b> financed, <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> commercialized by entrepreneurial clinical teams operating in Quebec’s (Canada) publicly funded healthcare system. Results Entrepreneurs have a direct influence over a new technology’s value proposition, but investors actively transform this value. Investors support a technology that can find a market, no matter its intrinsic value for clinical practice or healthcare systems. Regulatory agencies reinforce the “double” value of a new technology —as a health intervention and as an economic commodity— and provide economic worth to the venture that is bringing the technology to market. Conclusion Policy-oriented initiatives such as early health technology assessment (HTA) and coverage with evidence may provide technology developers with useful input regarding the decisions they make at an early stage. But to foster technologies that bring more value to healthcare systems, policy-makers must actively support the consideration of health policy issues in innovation policy...|$|R
40|$|A technoeconomic {{analysis}} of photoelectrochemical (PEC) and photovoltaic-electrolytic (PV-E) solar-hydrogen production of 10 000 kg H day (3. 65 kilotons per year) {{was performed to}} assess the economics of each technology, {{and to provide a}} basis for comparison between these technologies as well as within the broader energy landscape. Two PEC systems, differentiated primarily by the extent of solar concentration (unconcentrated and 10 × concentrated) and two PV-E systems, differentiated by the degree of grid connectivity (unconnected and grid supplemented), were analyzed. In each case, a base-case system that used established designs and materials was compared to prospective systems that might <b>be</b> <b>envisioned</b> <b>and</b> <b>developed</b> in the future with the goal of achieving substantially lower overall system costs. With identical overall plant efficiencies of 9. 8 %, the unconcentrated PEC and non-grid connected PV-E system base-case capital expenses for the rated capacity of 3. 65 kilotons H per year were $ 205 MM ($ 293 per m of solar collection area (m), $ 14. 7 W) and $ 260 MM ($ 371 m, $ 18. 8 W), respectively. The untaxed, plant-gate levelized costs for the hydrogen product (LCH) were $ 11. 4 kg and $ 12. 1 kg for the base-case PEC and PV-E systems, respectively. The 10 × concentrated PEC base-case system capital cost was $ 160 MM ($ 428 m, $ 11. 5 W) and for an efficiency of 20 % the LCH was $ 9. 2 kg. Likewise, the grid supplemented base-case PV-E system capital cost was $ 66 MM ($ 441 m, $ 11. 5 W), and with solar-to-hydrogen and grid electrolysis system efficiencies of 9. 8 % and 61 %, respectively, the LCH was $ 6. 1 kg. As a benchmark, a proton-exchange membrane (PEM) based grid-connected electrolysis system was analyzed. Assuming a system efficiency of 61 % and a grid electricity cost of $ 0. 07 kWh, the LCH was $ 5. 5 kg. A sensitivity analysis indicated that, relative to the base-case, increases in the system efficiency could effect the greatest cost reductions for all systems, due to the areal dependencies of many of the components. The balance-of-systems (BoS) costs were the largest factor in differentiating the PEC and PV-E systems. No single or combination of technical advancements based on currently demonstrated technology can provide sufficient cost reductions to allow solar hydrogen to directly compete on a levelized cost basis with hydrogen produced from fossil energy. Specifically, a cost of CO greater than ∼$ 800 (ton CO) was estimated to be necessary for base-case PEC hydrogen to reach price parity with hydrogen derived from steam reforming of methane priced at $ 12 GJ ($ 1. 39 (kg H)). A comparison with low CO and CO-neutral energy sources indicated that base-case PEC hydrogen is not currently cost-competitive with electrolysis using electricity supplied by nuclear power or from fossil-fuels in conjunction with carbon capture and storage. Solar electricity production and storage using either batteries or PEC hydrogen technologies are currently an order of magnitude greater in cost than electricity prices with no clear advantage to either battery or hydrogen storage as of yet. Significant advances in PEC technology performance and system cost reductions are necessary to enable cost-effective PEC-derived solar hydrogen for use in scalable grid-storage applications as well as for use as a chemical feedstock precursor to CO-neutral high energy-density transportation fuels. Hence such applications are an opportunity for foundational research to {{contribute to the development of}} disruptive approaches to solar fuels generation systems that can offer higher performance at much lower cost than is provided by current embodiments of solar fuels generators. Efforts to directly reduce CO photoelectrochemically or electrochemically could potentially produce products with higher value than hydrogen, but many, as yet unmet, challenges include catalytic efficiency and selectivity, and CO mass transport rates and feedstock cost. Major breakthroughs are required to obtain viable economic costs for solar hydrogen production, but the barriers to achieve cost-competitiveness with existing large-scale thermochemical processes for CO reduction are even greater...|$|R

40|$|This peer-reviewed paper {{draws upon}} the {{research}} of a cross-disciplinary, collaborative e-Science project, consisting of sociologists, biologists, medical informatics experts, computer scientists and software engineers. The project explored how ontologies – {{in the sense of}} structured and logically related knowledge or classification hierarchies embedded in a computer system – <b>are</b> <b>envisioned,</b> designed, <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> implemented. Many scientists regard ontologies as having enormous promise for the consistent use and re-use of data. In this paper, based on ethnographic observation, we argue that the challenges for ontology building are 'social' as much as they are technical. By this we mean the routine work undertaken in the building process, and the problems and difficulties entailed, can be understood in terms of the practices of knowledge workers and the practical nature of ‘sorting things out’. I have contributed my expertise in the sociology of science and technology and sociology of knowledge to many large-scale, multi-discipline e-Science projects that <b>developed</b> <b>and</b> capitalized on linked datasets and large-scale computing infrastructures.

40|$|Student Number : 9600874 K - MSc {{research}} report - School of Electrical Engineering - Faculty of Engineering and the Built EnvironmentTelecommunication networks have evolved from voice only single service networks to multimedia networks providing bearer {{services such as}} voice, data and video transportation. Moreover, these networks, collectively called Next Generation Networks (NGNs), enable rapid creation, deployment and management of advanced services in an efficient manner. However, the initial business model of telcos was to internally <b>develop</b> <b>and</b> provide these advanced services to customers. In this monopolized environment, service development is driven by technological availability rather than customer demands. Furthermore, vendor specific network elements prohibit the development of re-useable service components, which in turn increases the time-to-market of services. Deregulation and advances in Distributed Computing Systems (DCSs) are driving towards open networks and rapid service delivery. Third party Application Service Providers (ASPs) <b>are</b> <b>envisioned</b> to <b>develop</b> <b>and</b> supply the services, with the telco providing bearer services. The use of softswitch architectures such as Open Service Access (OSA) / Parlay (OSA / Parlay) in an open NGN environment abstract services from core network elements through its Application Programming Interface (API). Services are thus decoupled from vendor and protocol specific network equipment and can be provided across a plethora of network architectures. One major advantage of NGN {{is the ability to}} provide bearer service in a mobile environment. Location Based Services (LBSs) are envisaged to be an important class of services provided in the NGN environment. For an LBS service to be complete, a geospatial database is necessary to provide location information. This report documents the design and implementation of a Geospatial Data Access Service Capability Feature (GDASCF) as an extension to the OSA / Parlay gateway. The GDASCF encapsulates necessary APIs that offer uniform access to query geospatial databases. One key component of the design is the realization of the Adapter layer which adapts function calls to an appropriate Database Management System (DBMS). The introduction of the GDASCF and Adapter layer provides a solution which results in flexible and rapid service creation...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} language, {{specifically}} access to English, {{has emerged as}} a key concern for both U. S. policy-makers and immigrant communities alike. Many of these debates are framed by neoliberal and human capital perspectives, which view English as a set of skills and linguistic capital that are inextricably tied to employment opportunities and economic mobility. It is within this socio-historical, political, and discursive space that adult English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) classes <b>are</b> <b>envisioned,</b> <b>developed,</b> <b>and</b> implemented in various communities across the U. S. For decades, the federal government had allocated monies for states to fund programs that linked teaching English with the teaching of job readiness and workplace skills. In 1999, however, the Clinton administration launched a $ 70 million state grants program that integrated English literacy with civics education (EL/Civics). This was a clear departure from language education policies that positioned adult immigrants simply as workers who needed the linguistic skills to participate in the labor system. This paper argues that despite the purported aim to link English language instruction with broader notions of civic and political participation, a neoliberal agenda finds its way into the local implementation of the EL/Civics policy. Informed by poststructural and sociocultural theories as well as a transnational perspective, this paper draws on data from a 10 -month ethnographic study of an EL/Civics program in Queens, NY. I employed ethnographic data collection methods such as participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and audio-recorded classroom discourse. Guided by the following questions, the analysis focuses on how neoliberal discourses insinuate themselves into the organizational practices and classroom interactions of an EL/Civics program: How are neoliberal discourses both taken up and interrogated by adult immigrant students? How do neoliberal discourses interact with enduring narratives of immigration? This work adds to the growing research on the critical role that language teachers and language learners play in responding to and remaking policies in their classrooms—a process that is mediated by actors’ identities, local contexts, and widely-circulating discourses of immigration and neoliberal logic. The paper concludes with a discussion of how we can begin to rethink EL/Civics programs and approaches and provide an alternative to the neoliberal model of adult English language education...|$|R
