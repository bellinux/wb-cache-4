25|$|John Gough senior died by 'taking an {{overdose}} of strichnine'. The coroner's report which might explain the reason has not survived. The day after his death, the local Burrangong Courier had no explanation for the event: `A man {{of the name of}} John George Gough, an old colonist, who occupied a butcher's shop adjoining Myers' cordial manufactory in Main Street, committed suicide yesterday morning by swallowing strychnine. He was in the Diggers' Theatre, apparently in excellent spirits, on the previous night, and no one now can tell <b>what</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sad act. Gough was a widower, and leaves a young son who is now unprotected, and for whom we now appeal to the sympathies of the generous in order that he may be enabled to earn an honest living.|$|E
25|$|The 1860s were {{a time of}} {{opportunity}} for Woodland. The county seat was permanently moved to Woodland after Washington, California (now a part of West Sacramento) had flooded. Schools, homes, churches, and a cemetery were built at this time. The town's newspaper, the Daily Democrat, and a post office were established, and a rail line was built. In 1869, the California Pacific Railroad Company constructed a line between Davisville (now Davis) and Marysville with a Woodland station {{in the area of}} College Street and Lincoln Avenue. The rail line expanded and was eventually acquired by Southern Pacific Railroad. The track was then relocated from College Street to East Street, {{the eastern edge of the}} city at that point. The addition of the railroad is <b>what</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> expansion of Woodland as a town. Before the railroad came, people were building primarily on Main Street and northward. Later, expansion headed westward and southward, as well.|$|E

25|$|While {{the first}} game {{performed}} well enough in the West for Spike Chunsoft to decide to develop a sequel, both games were commercial failures in Japan. Because of this, the third game, which had originally been mentioned in 2012, was not approved by the management at the company. In February 2014, {{it was announced that}} development had been put on hold indefinitely. Uchikoshi examined the possibility of financing the development through the use of crowdfunding on a website like Kickstarter, but felt that the idea would not be persuasive enough for it to meet the goal; he also sought out opportunities with executives and investors. As a response to the news of the game's hiatus, fans of the series created Operation Bluebird, an online campaign to raise awareness of the series and support the development. In July 2015, Aksys Games announced that development of the third game had been resumed; the game being put on hold becoming big news, and fans being vocal about wanting a third game, was <b>what</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> game being reevaluated. With the third game, the development team wanted to renew the series' image in Japan; to do this, they used the English series title, Zero Escape, instead of the Kyokugen Dasshutsu title that had been used for previous Japanese releases.|$|E
25|$|Water boards (waterschap and hoogheemraadschap, pl. waterschappen and hoogheemraadschappen) {{are among}} the oldest {{government}} authorities in the Netherlands. They literally form {{the foundation of the}} whole Dutch system of local government; from time immemorial they have shouldered the responsibility for water management for the residents of their area. In polders this mainly involves regulating the water level. It has always been in the common interest to keep water out and polder residents have always had to work together. That is <b>what</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> creation of water boards. The structure of the water boards varies, but they all have a general administrative body and an executive board (college van dijkgraaf en heemraden) consisting of a chairperson (dijkgraaf) and other members ((hoog)heemraad, pl. (hoog)heemraden). The chairperson also presides the general administrative body. This body consists of people representing the various categories of stakeholders: landholders, leaseholders, owners of buildings, companies and, since recently, all the residents as well. Importance and financial contribution decide how many representatives each category may delegate. Certain stakeholders (e.g. environmental organisations) may be given the power to appoint members. The general administrative body elects the executive board from among its members. The government appoints the chairperson for a period of six years. The general administrative body is elected for a period of four years. In the past the administrative body was elected as individuals but from 2009 they will be elected as party representatives. Unlike municipal council elections, voters do not usually {{have to go to a}} polling station but can vote by mail.|$|E
500|$|In 1988, also {{serving in}} his {{capacity}} as the Yang-Di Pertuan Agong, the Lord President of the Federal Court Tun Salleh Abas was sacked by the Agong in <b>what</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1988 Malaysian constitutional crisis. However, observers suggested a remarkably warm relationship between then-Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamad with the Agong, both of whom shared common resentment against the chief justice, Salleh Abas. In 1973, [...] Iskandar was convicted of assault and was sentenced to six months imprisonment, of which Salleh Abas served as the public prosecutor hearing the case. As the public prosecutor, Salleh had appealed to the chief justice, Raja Azlan Shah (now the Sultan of Perak), for handing down a heavier sentence for [...] Iskandar, which naturally earned his wrath. The sacking of the Lord President, was however not without controversy, given the alleged manner in which the Agong and Prime Minister had handled the matter–including an incident which the Agong had refused to forgive the Lord President in spite of Salleh's willingness to offer his apology to the Agong, which he turned down.|$|E

[...] "Anything else is a different question". [...] "Virtually all of my critics understood the intended scenario. I personally read nearly three thousand letters (out of the many additional thousands that arrived) and found nearly every one insisting simply that because two options remained (or an equivalent error), the chances were even. Very few raised questions about ambiguity, and the letters actually published in the column were not among those few." [...] The answer follows if the car is placed randomly behind any door, the host must open a door revealing a goat regardless of the player's initial choice and, if two doors are available, chooses which one to open randomly (Mueser and Granberg, 1999). The table below shows {{a variety of other}} possible host behaviors and the impact on the success of switching.|$|E
