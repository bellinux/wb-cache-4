500|$|The Queensland Military Historical Society set up {{a bronze}} plaque at 304 Montague Road, South Brisbane, where Sing had died. In 1995, a statue of Sing was {{unveiled}} with honour in his home town of Clermont. In 2004, an Australian Army sniper team in Baghdad named their post the 'Billy Sing Bar & Grill.' On 19 May 2009, the 66th anniversary of Sing's death, the Chinese Consul-General, Ren Gongping, along with Returned and Services League of Australia officers and community leaders, laid wreaths at his grave. Ren said, [...] "Billy Sing {{is a symbol of}} the long history of Chinese in Australia, and the great role they have played in your nation's past ... It also reminds us that China and Australia were allies through both world wars, and that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and proud shared past." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following her tour in Europe, Madonna {{returned}} to the United States to perform. [...] Madonna urged her U.S. fans to appreciate their {{freedom of speech and}} claimed, [...] "I've seen some scary things. I've seen people being locked up and put in jail for speaking their minds, for being gay, for not practicing the right religion, for not dressing the proper way. Yeah, it's scary. But what it made me realize is how lucky I am to be living here in America. It doesn't mean that this is the perfect country. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way to go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Row steadily, Ruthven," [...] he shouted; [...] "don't spurt. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> row {{before us}} and must not knock {{ourselves}} {{up at the}} beginning." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{would like}} to have heard more, but time was {{pressing}} on and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way to go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Next day," [...] he began, {{without any}} emotion in his voice, [...] "she felt stronger, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> talk. She told me everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And it's not as {{if there}} had been any doubt about our knowing our minds. We both cared, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time before us. We could afford to wait.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] Ned answered; [...] "I will go {{fast for}} a bit, {{but you must}} not knock yourselves up; <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> journey before us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way {{still to}} go. Kindly walk {{clear of the}} path. Now let us follow the trail. I fear {{that it will not}} lead very far." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Joyce {{met them}} with a grave smile. [...] "You are prompt. I am glad to see you, Leo, and you, too, Mrs. Post. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> watch before us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{has been}} foolish," [...] she answered; [...] "I know that He {{has told me}} everything. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> talk this morning; the poor fellow threw himself upon my charity. He has signed notes to a large amount." ...|$|R
60|$|The Captain rode {{over several}} times to see us; and Miss Brough seemed always delighted to see him. One day I met him as I was walking out alone by the river, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> talk together.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. The fact is, I {{lost sight}} of Peterkin when I left Oxford--and since that time {{he seems to have}} drifted into difficulties. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> talk. He is living here, he tells me, until his affairs are settled." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes, uncle," [...] she said, {{getting up}} and looking round, [...] "it is time that we should go now; <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way to go, you know. Where is the boat?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Steady, Jessie, steady. You {{have been}} brave and quiet, coming down. The danger is over now, but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> walk and a longer ride before us, {{and you will}} need all your strength." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is a long}} story," [...] {{answered}} the King, with a Winged laugh; [...] "but as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> journey before us, I will pass the time by telling you about it, if you wish." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> walk in <b>a</b> sweltering hot day. Met Mr. Blackwood {{coming to}} call, and walked him on with us, so blinked his visit--gratias, domine!! Asked him for breakfast to-morrow to make amends. I rather over-walked myself--the heat considered.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{had called}} to say good-bye, on leaving London; and my aunt was not at home. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{delightful}} talk together. She asked me so kindly to visit her in Scotland, and be introduced to Lord Northlake, that I accepted the invitation with a glad heart.|$|R
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{good time}} on the island, and stayed nearly all day. Toward {{the end of the}} afternoon, we started back for the creek and our boat. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> walk, for <b>we</b> <b>had</b> been {{exploring}} the island pretty well, and when, at last, we reached the creek, we saw that our boat was gone! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This attempt has failed; but I shall {{try again}} and again until I succeed, {{providing}} {{we get out of}} this scrape alive, which is by no means certain, for <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and perilous journey before us." ...|$|E
6000|$|She smiled. [...] "I {{have come}} a long way tonight," [...] she said, [...] "and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way to go before we shall be out of danger. Come; I shall tell you all about as we go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if {{you insist}} on it, I'm agreed. But do put your pipe out, Tom, and let us resume our march, for <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way to go, and much work to do before {{reaching}} the camp to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{sitting in}} the Court. Came home through a cold easterly rain without a greatcoat, and was well wet. A goodly {{medicine}} for my aching bones.[433] Dined at Mr. Adam Wilson's, and had some good singing in the evening. Saw Dr. Stokoe, who attended Boney in Saint Helena, a plain, sensible sort of man.[434] ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and {{intensely}} uninteresting {{conversation about}} the maladies to which chickens are subject. He was verbose and reminiscent. He took me over his farm, pointing out as we went Dorkings with pasts, and Cochin Chinas which he had cured of diseases generally fatal on, as far as I could gather, Christian Science principles.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Sit {{firmly in}} the saddle, my lord, for <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way to go and no time to waste,' said the brown horse, and Petru soon {{saw that they were}} riding as no man and horse had ever ridden before.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is so," [...] the seneschal said heartily. [...] "I {{shall be}} glad {{to talk to you}} again, sir; but at present, madame, it is time to mount. The troops are mustering, and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> ride before us.|$|E
6000|$|... "By my hilt! {{he is our}} master, Michel," [...] quoth Aylward, [...] "and {{such men}} as we do not serve under a laggart. But here are four deniers, Michel, and God be with you! En avant, camarades! for <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> road before us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And then we {{discussed}} it afterward. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> discussion. And then he read us the 'Legend of Pornic,' and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> discussion about that. Mrs. Bowen {{says it was}} real gold they found in the coffin; but I {{think it was the}} girl's 'gold hair.' I don't know which Mr. Morion thought. Which do you? Don't you think the 'Legend of Pornic' is splendid?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay, she pounced at last, and well-nigh staked {{herself on}} the heron's beak! But <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> ride, and were well-nigh at the Tyne before <b>we</b> <b>had</b> caught her. Full of pranks, but a noble hawk, as I shall write to my brother by the next {{messenger}} that comes our way. I call it a hawk worth her meat that leads one such a gallop.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here, in Eyethorne. Last August, when I {{was walking}} {{in the woods with}} Fan, we met him, and he {{recognised}} Fan, whom he had met in London at Miss Starbrow's house, and spoke to her. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> conversation on that day, and I met him again and talked with him the next day, and after that we kept up the acquaintance by letter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, Simon, I {{have not}} enough breath {{to blow out}} a candle," [...] said he. [...] "Stint your haste for a minute, since <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> night before us. Surely {{this man is a}} friend indeed, if you hasten so to see him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit down here," [...] he said. [...] "I {{have some}} meat and fruit {{here and a}} small skin of water. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> journey before us, for we must get near the town you left this morning before daybreak, and you must eat to keep up your strength." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed!" [...] {{the colonel}} said; [...] "then {{they have seen}} fighting. Perhaps you will ride on {{with me to the}} head of the column again; <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> day's march before us, and if your young friends will give us some of their {{experiences}} it will while away the time." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{told him}} to go on with his planting, and I offered to get down on my knees beside him and help, but he gallantly handed me to a seat in the shade beside his daughter's flower-bed, and it was there that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> talk about {{conditions}} in America and Altruria, and how he felt about the great change in his life.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps I {{had better}} not say, Leslie. I {{have been doing}} some {{scouting}} across the desert, with my boy here. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> ride. In the first place, my arm wants attending to. I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> bullet in the shoulder. The next thing we need is something to eat; {{for the last three}} days <b>we</b> <b>have</b> had nothing but dates, and not too many of them.|$|R
60|$|When Jack {{concluded}} his recital {{of what he}} {{had seen}} in this remarkable cave, I could not rest satisfied till I had dived down to see it; which I did, but found it so dark, as Jack had said, that I could scarcely see anything. When I returned <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> conversation about, it, during which I observed that Peterkin <b>had</b> <b>a</b> most lugubrious expression on his countenance.|$|R
