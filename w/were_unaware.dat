40|$|This paper {{develops}} a contracting {{model in which}} the principal frames the contract when the agent <b>is</b> <b>unaware</b> of some contingencies, yet is aware that she may <b>be</b> <b>unaware.</b> We call the contract vague if the agent <b>is</b> still <b>unaware</b> of some contingencies after understanding the contract. We show that the optimal contract is vague {{if and only if}} the principal exploits the agent. Applying the model to an insurance problem, we show the insuree is free from exploitation if she slightly underestimates the unforeseen calamities. In a contracting problem, whenever the contractor <b>is</b> <b>unaware</b> of the force majeure event, she is exploited by the employer. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

They each demonstrated the effectiveness of countershading, without succeeding in persuading their armed forces to adopt the technique, though they influenced military adoption of camouflage in general.|$|E
