According to Henry Wood, her training of the chorus to project the diction into the auditorium <b>was</b> <b>wonderful</b> and inscrutable. This season was conducted by Frank Bridge. In 1912 she toured the provinces with the Denhof Opera Company. After this she retired from the stage.|$|E
25|$|The grace, strength, {{and safety}} of his marking, {{especially}} at full-back, has seldom been matched; and the consistent beauty, length, and accuracy of his drop kicking <b>was</b> <b>wonderful</b> to behold. He was a tough, tenacious, and fearless footballer, able to play through injury and, {{on at least one}} occasion, played with a broken bone in his arm (Hogan, 1996, p.224). Although predominantly a right foot kick, he could kick well with either foot.|$|E

Before her departure, Mrs. Adelina Türr insisted upon visiting the orphanages, where the children greeted her with a most abundant dose of confetti.

25|$|From 1892, Hearne was {{the stock}} bowler {{not only for}} Middlesex, {{but also for the}} MCC, which at the time played against the {{counties}} Middlesex did not arrange County Championship fixtures with. In 1893, Hearne surpassed his previous form by taking over 200 wickets in a dry summer and his persistence and skill on hard pitches (notably in the two games with Nottinghamshire) <b>was</b> <b>wonderful.</b> In 1894, a very wet summer, Hearne just failed to reach 200, yet his omission from the 1894/1895 tour of Australia remains puzzling given his persistence and pace from the ground might have been well-suited to the hard pitches then evolving in Australia.|$|E
25|$|When I saw Going My Way I was as {{moved as}} they were by the {{character}} he played. Father O'Malley handled that gang of young hooligans in his parish with such kindness and wisdom that I thought he <b>was</b> <b>wonderful</b> too. Instead of coming {{down hard on the}} kids and withdrawing his affection, he forgave them their misdeeds, took them to the ball game and picture show, taught them how to sing. By the last reel, the sheer persistence of his goodness had transformed even the worst of them into solid citizens. Then the lights came on and the movie was over.

25|$|When Allen read Robert Daley's book, Prince of the City (1978), she was {{convinced}} it was a Sidney Lumet project, but the film rights had already been sold to Orion Pictures for Brian De Palma and David Rabe. Allen {{let it be known}} that if that deal should fall through, then she wanted the picture for Sidney. Just as Lumet was about to sign for a different picture, they got the call that Prince of the City was theirs. Allen hadn't wanted to write Prince of the City, just produce it. She was put off by the book's non-linear story structure, but Lumet wouldn't make the picture without her and agreed to write the outline for her. Lumet and Allen went over the book and agreed on what they could use and what they could do without. To her horror, Lumet would come in every day for weeks and scribble on legal pads. She was terrified that she would have to tell him that his stuff was unusable, but to her delight the outline <b>was</b> <b>wonderful</b> and she went to work. It was her first project with living subjects, and Allen interviewed nearly everyone in the book and had endless hours of Bob Leuci's tapes for back-up. With all her research and Lumet's outline, she eventually turned out a 365-page script in 10 days. It was nearly impossible to sell the studio on a three-hour picture, but by offering to slash the budget to $10 million they agreed.|$|E

I finally figured out what it was when Nick came in and he had a kind of {{androgynous}} quality that worked. I thought he looked like Joe College, but he could scare the hell out of you." [...] Producer Glen Morgan said Chinlund's performance was outstanding. Nutter stated [...] "Nick Chinlund <b>was</b> <b>wonderful</b> to work with. The guy was like putty in my hands. He was great.

500|$|In 1929, Wood {{played a}} celebrated {{practical}} joke on musicologists and critics. [...] "I got very {{fed up with}} them, always finding fault with any arrangement or orchestrations that I made ... 'spoiling the original' etc. etc.", and so Wood passed off his own orchestration of Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, as a transcription by a Russian composer called Paul Klenovsky. In Wood's later account, {{the press and the}} BBC [...] "fell into the trap and said the scoring <b>was</b> <b>wonderful,</b> Klenovsky had the real flare [...] for true colour etc. – and performance after performance was given and asked for." [...] Wood kept the secret for five years before revealing the truth. [...] The press treated the deception as a great joke; The Times entered into the spirit of it with a jocular tribute to the lamented Klenovsky.|$|E

500|$|Kreuk {{enjoyed the}} fourth season {{because it gave}} her the chance to stretch her acting {{abilities}} with Lana's storyline involving the spirit of Countess Margaret Isobel Thoreaux.

[...] Kreuk says her strangest moment on the show was playing a vampire in season five's [...] "Thirst", an experience she remembers as [...] "uncomfortable" [...] due to the fake blood they covered her in. Kreuk left the series at the end of the seventh season, but appeared in five episodes in season eight as a guest star.|$|E
