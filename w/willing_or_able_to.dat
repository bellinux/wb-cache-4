Others, including the historian Antoni Dudek, feel that there was no sufficient justification for the imposition of martial law that followed.|$|E

60|$|Well {{might the}} whole {{position}} be called as slippery a one as ever occurred in British politics. It {{was by the}} principles of free trade that Peel and his lieutenant justified tariff-reform; and they indirectly sapped protection in general by dwelling on the mischiefs of minor forms of protection in particular. They assured the country gentlemen that the sacred principle of a scale was as tenderly cherished in the new plan as in the old; {{on the other hand}} they could assure the leaguers and the doubters that the structure of the two scales was widely different. We cannot wonder that honest tories who stuck to the old doctrine, not always rejected even by Huskisson, that a country ought not to be dependent on foreign supply, were mystified and amazed as they listened to the two rival parties disputing to which of them belonged the credit of originating a policy that each of them had so short a time before so scornfully denounced. The only difference was the difference between yesterday and the day before yesterday. The whigs, with their fixed duty, were just as open as the conservatives with their sliding-scale to the taunts of the Manchester school, when they decorated economics by high a priori declaration that the free importation of corn was not a subject for the deliberations of the senate, but a natural and inalienable law of the Creator. Rapid was the conversion. Even Lord Palmerston, of all people in the world, denounced the arrogance and presumptuous folly of dealers in restrictive duties 'setting up their miserable legislation instead of the great standing laws of nature.' Mr. Disraeli, still warmly {{on the side of the}} minister, flashed upon his uneasy friends around him a reminder of the true pedigree of the dogmas of free trade. Was it not Mr. Pitt who first promulgated them in 1787, who saw that the loss of the market of the American colonies made it necessary by lowering duties to look round for new markets on the continent of Europe? And was it not Fox, Burke, Sheridan, and the minor whig luminaries, who opposed him, while not a single member of his own government in the House of Lords was <b>willing</b> <b>or</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> defend him? But even reminiscences of Mr. Pitt, and oracular descriptions of Lord Shelburne as the most remarkable man of his age, brought little comfort to men sincerely convinced with fear and trembling that free corn would destroy rent, close their mansions and their parks, break up their lives, and beggar the country. They remembered also one or two chapters of history nearer to their own time. They knew that Lord John had a right to revive the unforgotten contrast between Peel's rejection of so-called protestant securities in 1817 and 1825, and the total surrender of emancipation in 1829. Natural forebodings darkened their souls that protectionism would soon share the fate of protestantism, and that capitulation to Cobden was doomed to follow the old scandal of capitulation to O'Connell. They felt that there was something much more dreadful than the mere sting of a parliamentary recrimination, in the contrast between the corn bill of 1842 and Peel's panegyrics in '39, '40, and '41 on the very system which that bill now shattered. On the other side some could not forget that in 1840 the whig prime minister, the head of a party still even at the eleventh hour unregenerated by Manchester, predicted a violent struggle as the result of the Manchester policy, stirring society to its foundations, kindling bitter animosities not easy to quench, and creating convulsions as fierce as those of the Reform bill.|$|E
6000|$|Another sign of our times, also {{marked by}} an {{analogous}} political movement, {{is the new}} importance given to the single person. Everything that tends to insulate the individual--to surround him with barriers of natural respect, so that each man shall feel the world is his, and man shall treat with man as a sovereign state with a sovereign state--tends to true union as well as greatness. [...] "I learned," [...] said the melancholy Pestalozzi,[92] [...] "that no man in God's wide earth is either <b>willing</b> <b>or</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> help any other man." [...] Help must come from the bosom alone. The scholar is that man who must take up into himself all {{the ability of the}} time, all the contributions of the past, all the hopes of the future. He must be an university of knowledges. If there be one lesson more than another that should pierce his ear, it is--The world is nothing, the man is all; in yourself is the law of all nature, and you know not yet how a globule of sap ascends; in yourself slumbers the whole of Reason; it is for you to know all; it is for you to dare all. Mr. President and Gentlemen, this confidence in the unsearched might of man belongs, by all motives, by all prophecy, by all preparation, to the American Scholar. We have listened too long to the courtly muses of Europe. The spirit of the American freeman is already suspected to be timid, imitative, tame. Public and private avarice make the air we breathe thick and fat. The scholar is decent, indolent, complaisant. See already the tragic consequence. The mind of this country, taught to aim at low objects, eats upon itself. There is no work for any one but the decorous and the complaisant. Young men of the fairest promise, who begin life upon our shores, inflated by the mountain winds, shined upon by all the stars of God, find the earth below not in unison with these, but are hindered from action by the disgust which the principles on which business is managed inspire, and turn drudges, or die of disgust, some of them suicides. What is the remedy? They did not yet see, and thousands of young men as hopeful now crowding to the barriers for the career do not yet see, that if the single man plant himself indomitably on his instincts, and there abide, the huge world will come round to him. Patience,--patience; with the shades of all the good and great for company; and for solace the perspective of your own infinite life; and for work the study and the communication of principles, the making those instincts prevalent, the conversion of the world. Is it not the chief disgrace in the world, not to be an unit; not to be reckoned one character; not to yield that peculiar fruit which each man was created to bear, but to be reckoned in the gross, in the hundred, or the thousand, of the party, the section, to which we belong; and our opinion predicted geographically, as the north, or the south? Not so, brothers and friends,--please God, ours shall not be so. We will walk on our own feet; we will work with our own hands; we will speak our own minds. Then shall man be no longer a name for pity, for doubt, and for sensual indulgence. The dread of man and the love of man shall be a wall of defense and a wreath of joy around all. A nation of men will for the first time exist, because each believes himself inspired by the Divine Soul which also inspires all men.|$|E

5000|$|The {{geographically}} agnostic {{nature of}} software means that new business opportunities may arise for those organisations {{who have a}} political or regulatory impediment to offshoring or outsourcing.

Secondly, and conversely, BPO providers have previously relocated outsourced operations to different political and geographic territories in response to changing wage inflation and new labor arbitrage opportunities elsewhere.

40|$|A {{bidirectional}} transformation {{consists of}} a function get that takes a source (document or value) to a view and a function put that takes an updated view and the original source back to an updated source, governed by certain consistency conditions relating the two functions. Both the database and programming language communities have studied techniques that essentially allow a user to specify only one of get and put and have the other inferred automatically. All approaches so far to this bidirectionalization task have been syntactic in nature, either proposing a domain-specific language with limited expressiveness but built-in (and composable) backward components, or restricting get to a simple syntactic form from which some algorithm can synthesize an appropriate definition for put. Here we present a semantic approach instead. The idea {{is to take a}} general-purpose language, Haskell, and write a higher-order function that takes (polymorphic) get-functions as arguments and returns appropriate put-functions. All this on the level of semantic values, without being <b>willing,</b> <b>or</b> even <b>able,</b> <b>to</b> inspect the definition of get, and thus liberated from syntactic restraints.

However only few results exist when the goal is to find optimal combinations of reinsurance treaties because of computational complexity or non-convexity of the objective functions.

We apply two state-of-theart MOEAs, the NSGA-II and the ɛ-MOEA and compare their results in our problem setting. The presented approach is flexible with respect to real world modifications concerning risk measurement, cost calculation principles and different combinations of reinsurance treaties. Finally, we do not only solve open mathematical problems on complex reinsurance combinations but we consequently give new heuristic interpretations to supplement existing theoretic results...|$|R

Important decisions are based on the results of spreadsheet programs and the list of known errors with large impact is growing daily- although it surely is only the top of an iceberg. One way out of the crisis might be the introduction of software engineering techniques into spreadsheet development. Suggestions for the improvement of spreadsheet development range back as far as into the late eighties, but none has been successful yet.
