50|$|Turturoena, {{commonly}} called bronze-naped pigeon, is a pigeon subgenus comprising three species: the eastern bronze-naped pigeon, the <b>western</b> <b>bronze-naped</b> <b>pigeon,</b> and the São Tomé bronze-naped pigeon.|$|E
50|$|The <b>western</b> <b>bronze-naped</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Columba iriditorques) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Columbidae. It is found in Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Togo, Uganda, and Zambia. It {{is part of the}} Turturoena subgenus.|$|E
50|$|The island <b>bronze-naped</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Columba malherbii), {{also known}} as the São Tomé <b>bronze-naped</b> <b>pigeon,</b> is a species of bird in the family Columbidae. It is found in the Gulf of Guinea islands of Annobón (rarely Patopi), Equatorial Guinea and São Tomé and Príncipe. Its natural habitat is {{subtropical}} or tropical moist lowland forests. It is part of the Turturoena subgenus. The species of birds was described by Jules and Edouard Verreaux in 1851.|$|R
5000|$|This {{forest is}} an {{important}} breeding area for the eastern <b>bronze-naped</b> <b>pigeon</b> and home to the endangered spotted ground thrush. At least 165 species of birds {{have been identified in}} the area.|$|R
5000|$|Mount Elgon {{is home to}} {{at least}} 144 bird species. Of {{particular}} interest are Jackson's francolin, the eastern <b>bronze-naped</b> <b>pigeon,</b> Hartlaub's turaco, the Tacazze sunbird and the endangered lammergeier, due to their restricted range.|$|R
50|$|The eastern <b>bronze-naped</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Columba delegorguei) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Columbidae. It is found in Angola, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. It {{is part of the}} Turturoena subgenus.|$|R
50|$|The {{species has}} been {{classified}} as Near Threatened by the IUCN due to substantial hunting pressure, {{which may be}} increasing. While the island <b>bronze-naped</b> <b>pigeon</b> is able {{to make use of}} secondary vegetation and somewhat degraded habitats, it also may be captured more easily in such areas than in dense vegetation.|$|R
5000|$|Female trees bear their fruit irregularly, {{only every}} few years. The fleshy epimatium of the strobilus (or [...] "cone") covers {{all of the}} seed, and ripens to a yellow colour, when it acquires a soft, jelly-like consistency. The main agents of seed {{dispersal}} are fruit bats, which eat the fleshy covering but discard the hard, woody seed. Many birds feed on the fruits, such as Cape parrot, purple-crested turaco, Knysna turaco, Ross's turaco, African olive pigeon, African green <b>pigeon,</b> and eastern <b>bronze-naped</b> <b>pigeon.</b> [...] Animals that feed on the seeds include colobus monkeys, bushpigs, hornbills, turacos, and rodents. These may not be effective seed dispersal agents, because it appears that seeds that have gone through animal guts do not germinate well.|$|R
5000|$|... 28 bird species, all forest dwellers, are {{endemic to}} ecoregion. Seven species are endemic to Príncipe. The endemic {{subspecies}} of olive ibis on Príncipe, B. o. rothschildi, {{is probably the}} rarest bird in the archipelago. Sixteen species are endemic to São Tomé, with two endemic genera. These include the São Tomé ibis (Bostrychia bocagei), São Tomé olive pigeon (Columba thomensis), São Tomé scops-owl (Otus hartlaubi), São Tomé fiscal (Lanius newtoni), São Tomé shorttail (Amaurocichla bocagii), giant sunbird (Nectarinia thomensis), São Tomé grosbeak (Neospiza concolor) and São Tomé oriole (Oriolus crassirostris). Annobón {{is home to the}} endemic Annobón white-eye (Zosterops griseovirescens) and Annobón paradise-flycatcher, (Terpsiphone smithii). An additional four endemic species inhabit two or more of the islands, including the Príncipe speirops (Speirops leucophoeus) and velvet-mantled drongo (Dicrurus modestus), which inhabit both São Tomé and Príncipe, and the São Tomé <b>bronze-naped</b> <b>pigeon</b> (Columba malherbii) which inhabits both São Tomé and Annobón.|$|R
