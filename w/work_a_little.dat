Aguilera speaks the lyrics, [...] "After all you put me through, you'd think I'd despise you / But in the end, I wanna thank you, 'cause you made me that much stronger" [...] on the guitar theme by Dave Navarro. Lyrically, Aguilera wants to thank {{the man who did}} her wrong rather than insult him, because he helped make her stronger and work harder, thus making her a fighter. At the chorus, she sings, [...] "'Cause it makes me that much stronger/ Makes me <b>work</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit harder/ Makes me that much wiser/ So thanks for making me a fighter". The chords in the guitar part are E5 – F5 – G5 – A5 – B5 − C5 – B5 – A5 – G5 – F5 [...] E5. She continues, [...] "Made me learn a little bit faster/ Made my skin a little bit thicker/ Makes me that much smarter/ So thanks for making me a fighter".

500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{said the}} episode [...] "was able to rise a few notches above the last one" [...] {{and that he}} enjoyed Leslie's antics and many of Tom's antics, {{including}} his suggestions for Leslie's introduction for her mom. He also liked the scene in which Mark pinched Leslie's nose, which he described as [...] "a nice, playful scene that brought some much needed humanity to her cartoonish character". Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode, particularly the characters Tom and Ann. He said of the episode, [...] "The little things like (Leslie's haircut and Ann overdressing) are what's making this show <b>work</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more with each episode. Finding humor in the small things of small government." [...] Brian Howard of The Journal News said the series is not great yet, but that [...] "The Banquet" [...] included glimpses of possible greatness in the future, particularly in the performances by Poehler, Jones, Ansari and Schneider. Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club said the laughs in the episode, particularly involving Leslie's haircut and her perceived romantic relationship with Ann, were [...] "a bit thin". Phipps also said he found himself disliking Leslie, of whom he said, [...] "Here she seems more stupid than pleasantly naïve." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a bowler it {{was said}} by the all-rounder George Giffen that: [...] "... he would keep a fine line outside the off-stump, and never minded being hit. [...] Sometimes the ball would <b>work</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> from the pitch which victimised most of the batsmen." [...] He would release the ball from as high a point as he could reach, taking {{advantage}} of his [...] (183 centimetre) frame. [...] Later in his career, as his bowling fell away, he became a powerful batsman, particularly square of the wicket. He was also noted for his speed in the field: in a Sydney match in 1887 it {{was reported in the}} press that he caught a skied ball [...] "in a display of breathtaking agility".|$|E

2500|$|His first {{published}} <b>work,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> book of meditations under the quaint title of [...] dated from 1728. The controversial treatises which he published {{in rapid succession}} from London attracted much attention, particularly his Catholic Christian Instructed (1737), which was prefaced by a witty reply to Conyers Middleton's Letter from Rome, showing an Exact Conformity between Popery and Paganism. Challoner was the author over the years of numerous controversial and devotional works, which have been frequently reprinted and translated into various languages. In 1740 he brought out a new prayer book for the laity, the Garden of the Soul, which until the mid 20th century remained a favourite work of devotion, though the many editions that have since appeared have been [...] so altered that little of the original work remains.|$|E
2500|$|Bugge Wesseltoft had a {{great impact}} on the Norwegian Jazz scene at the {{beginning}} of the 1990s, while going through a transition from Nordic jazz traditions exemplified by the ECM label to a style sometimes referred to as [...] "future jazz" [...] or nu jazz.

60|$|April 5.--Read {{prayers to}} {{what remains of}} our party: being Anne, my niece Anne, the four Skenes, and William Forbes.

Thus it drew towards dinner in conclusion, after which we smoked, told stories, and drank tea.|$|E

60|$|A moment more, {{and they}} were rushing grandly in on a {{mountain}} of snow, with black rocks rising on either side. It was nervous <b>work.</b> <b>A</b> <b>little</b> to the right or {{a little to the}} left, and their frail bark would have been dashed to pieces.

60|$|Then {{he walked}} out into the dungeon and the {{officers}} surrounded him, and they kept up a low and earnest buzzing of conversation for fifteen minutes, I should think, and then the doctor took his departure from the prison.

60|$|February 28.--At Court till four. When I {{came home}} I did <b>work</b> <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> {{but as we}} {{expected}} company {{it was not to}} much purpose.

Stayed till wine-and-water time. Thus flew another day.|$|E

60|$|You {{might have}} thought that this frankness on the girl's part would have kept Henry from {{falling in love with}} her.
