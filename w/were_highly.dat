30|$|When {{looking at}} the {{education}} level, we observe a curvilinear relationship with age at migration and education level. The higher the age at migration, the higher the probability that an immigrant <b>is</b> <b>highly</b> educated. It <b>is</b> the opposite result in terms of middle and low education. Female and married immigrants {{are more likely to}} <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> educated. However, immigrants with children were less likely to <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> educated. In line with expectations, an immigrant is much more likely to <b>be</b> <b>highly</b> educated if the human capital for the region of origin is higher.|$|R

5|$|After the Second World Congress in 1948, the International Secretariat {{attempted}} to open communications with Josip Broz Tito's regime in Yugoslavia. In their analysis, it {{differed from the}} rest of the Eastern Bloc because it was established by the partisans of World War II who had fought against Nazi occupation, as opposed to by Stalin's invading armies. The British RCP, led by Jock Haston and supported by Ted Grant, <b>were</b> <b>highly</b> critical of this move.|$|E

5|$|Crawley {{was already}} a modest {{industrial}} centre {{by the end of}} the Second World War. Building was an important trade: 800 people were employed by building and joinery firms, and two—Longley's and Cook's—were large enough to have their own factories. In 1949, 1,529 people worked in manufacturing: the main industries were light and precision engineering and aircraft repair.

5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century the {{writings}} of Humphrey Repton (1752–1818) <b>were</b> <b>highly</b> influential in {{the return of the}} formal garden near to the house. His sons were directly involved in the restructuring of the landscape at Valleyfield, Fife. Walter Scott's dislike of the sweeping away of the old formal gardens was also influential in creating an emphasis on preservation and restoration. His ideas were taken up by John Claudius Loudon (1783–1843), the most prolific gardening author of the century in Britain, and <b>were</b> <b>highly</b> influential throughout the world. By 1850 ambitious formal gardens had been recreated at Drummond Castle, Dunrobin and Drumlandrig. New plants from around the world, often discovered and sampled by Scots, such as the rhododendron and monkey puzzle tree, meant that Victorian and Edwardian gardens were characterised by an eclectic mix of the formal, picturesque and gardenesque. By {{the end of the century}} the ideas of William Robinson (1838–1935), Gertrude Jekyll (1843–1932) and the Edinburgh-based Frances Hope (d. 1880), arguing for informal flower-based gardens, had begun to dominate. They resulted in a revival of the seventeenth-century mixed flower and kitchen garden, as carried out at Kellie Castle, and Earlshall, Fife by Robert Lorimer.|$|E
