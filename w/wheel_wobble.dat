25|$|Pironi was 15 laps {{from the}} end, {{when he noticed}} a front <b>wheel</b> <b>wobble</b> on his Ligier. He slowed the car to approx 50km/h (30mph) before the wheel came off, and he pulled off the track {{at the end of}} the start/finish {{straight}} to retire, giving Jones the lead. Jones continued to keep a fairly constant distance between himself and second placed Jochen Mass to win the race, with Elio de Angelis, the only other car to be on the lead lap, finishing third. Jean-Pierre Jarier and Emerson Fittipaldi finished in fourth and fifth place respectively, both one lap down. Sixth placed Patrick Gaillard was the last driver to be classified as finishing the race, five laps down after his earlier collision with John Watson's car.|$|E

50|$|Drivers {{generally}} found handling on Seddon RUs vague, {{and steering}} imprecise. Geoffrey Hillditch refers to 'a most peculiar feeling' when driving one. Steering bushes, axle thrust pads and king pins were less durable {{than they should}} have been, adding to steering troubles, whilst unbalanced front wheels could cause the steering <b>wheel</b> to <b>wobble.</b> Weight was biased too much toward the rear and this exacerbated handling problems. The polyurethane bushes wore 'alarmingly' and were replaced by traditional (regularly) greased chromium-plated brass units. Springs were not substantial enough.|$|R
5|$|Wobble, shimmy, tank-slapper, speed wobble, {{and death}} wobble are all {{words and phrases}} used to {{describe}} a rapid (410Hz) oscillation of primarily just the front end (front wheel, fork, and handlebars). Also involved is the yawing of the rear frame which {{may contribute to the}} wobble when too flexible. This instability occurs mostly at high speed and is similar to that experienced by shopping cart wheels, airplane landing gear, and automobile front <b>wheels.</b> While <b>wobble</b> or shimmy can be easily remedied by adjusting speed, position, or grip on the handlebar, it can be fatal if left uncontrolled.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{reasons why}} <b>wheel</b> <b>wobble</b> occurs in common production bicycles. In particular, {{the effects of}} frame size, rider position and riding style are examined with reference {{to a range of}} mathematical models of bicycles which are available in the published literature. Much of the motivation for this work comes from the personal cycling experience of one of the authors and the difficulty in resolving the true cause of <b>wheel</b> <b>wobble</b> from the wide range of advice offered of a variety of cycling experts. It is hoped that recourse to a mathematical analysis will give objective direction as to how <b>wheel</b> <b>wobble</b> can be alleviated through rider intervention...|$|E
5000|$|Allowable play varies greatly {{depending}} on the use. As example, a wheelbarrow wheel supports radial and axial loads. Axial loads may be hundreds of newtons force left or right, and it is typically acceptable for the <b>wheel</b> to <b>wobble</b> {{by as much as}} 10 mm under the varying load. In contrast, a lathe may position a cutting tool to ±0.02 mm using a ball lead screw held by rotating bearings. The bearings support axial loads of thousands of newtons in either direction, and must hold the ball lead screw to ±0.002 mm across that range of loads ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{first race}} of the 1950 season was run on February 5 at the Daytona Beach Road Course in Daytona Beach, Florida. Joe Littlejohn won the pole. Harold Kite of East Point, Georgia, a former Army tank driver who began racing on the short tracks after World War II, drove past Red Byron in the 25th lap {{and went on to}} score a convincing victory in the 200-mile Grand National lid-lifter of the 1950 season. Kite, {{competing}} in his first Grand National event, pushed his Lincoln around the sandy course at a record 89.894 mph and beat runner-up Byron to the finish line by 53 seconds. Third place went to Lloyd Moore, Al Gross was fourth, and J.C. Van Landingham, ending a lengthy retirement, finished fifth. A crowd estimated at 9,500 watched Kite take the lead at the outset from Pole sitter Joe Littlejohn. Kite, a captain in the National Guard, held the top spot until Byron passed him on the 15th lap. The defending NASCAR champ relinquished the lead to Kite in the 24th lap when he made a pit stop. Several laps later Byron was forced to make another pit stop to repair gear shift problems. He finally returned to the fray, running seventh. Kite went uncontested for {{the second half of the}} 48-lap affair on the 4.167-mile course, but Byron provided plenty of action as he worked his way up through the pack. He nipped Moore for second place with a final lap pass. Forty-one cars started the event and 21 were still running at the finish despite the fact that conditions on the beach were less than ideal. Bob Flock turned in one of the most spirited efforts on the cloudy, breezy day. He finished seventh despite the fact that the left front <b>wheel</b> <b>wobbled</b> around every turn ...|$|R
25|$|On {{the night}} of March 22, 1970, Kathleen Johns was driving from San Bernardino to Petaluma to visit her mother. She was seven months {{pregnant}} and had her 10-month-old daughter beside her. While heading west on Highway 132 near Modesto, a car behind her began honking its horn and flashing its headlights. She pulled {{off the road and}} stopped. The man in the car parked behind her, approached her car, stated that he observed that her right rear <b>wheel</b> was <b>wobbling,</b> and offered to tighten the lug nuts. After finishing his work, the man drove off; yet when Johns pulled forward to re-enter the highway the wheel almost immediately came off the car. The man returned, offering to drive her to the nearest gas station for help. She and her daughter climbed into his car.|$|R
500|$|The duo modeled their {{relationship}} on writers Billy Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond, but were much closer friends {{rather than just}} writing partners. They took the approach {{that they were in}} a band together and purposely studied teams to discover why they break up. Kurtzman later explained in 2009 that [...] "One big thing that makes the <b>wheels</b> start to <b>wobble</b> is when someone feels that the contribution isn't 50-50. We make sure we live up to the partnership. If we didn't, we wouldn't have lasted this long." ...|$|R
50|$|Mathematically, {{the moment}} of inertia of the wheel is a tensor. That is, to a first {{approximation}} (neglecting deformations due to its elasticity) the wheel and axle assembly are a rigid rotor to which the engine and brakes apply a torque vector aligned with the axle. If that torque vector is not aligned with the principal axis of {{the moment of}} inertia, the resultant angular acceleration {{will be in a}} different direction from the applied torque. Whenever a rotor is forced to rotate about an axis that is not a principal axis, an external torque is needed. This is not a torque about the rotation axis (as in a driving or braking torque), but is a torque perpendicular to that direction. If the rotor is suspended by bearings, this torque is created by reaction forces in the bearings (acting perpendicular to the shaft). These reaction forces turn with the shaft as the rotor turns, at every point producing exactly the torque needed to keep the wheel rotating about the non-principal axis. These reaction forces can excite the structure to which they are attached. In the case of a car, the suspension elements can vibrate giving an uncomfortable feel to the car occupants. In practical terms, the <b>wheel</b> will <b>wobble.</b> Automotive technicians reduce the wobble to an acceptable level when balancing the wheel by adding small weights to the inner and outer wheel rims.|$|R
5000|$|Michael and Daniel Murphy {{had both}} left home, Michael {{working on a}} {{government}} experimental farm near Westbrook, while Daniel was a Brisbane police constable. Michael had returned home for the Christmas holidays and on 26 December (Boxing Day), 1898, had taken his sister Theresa 'Ellen' to the Mount Sylvia Races in nearby Caffey. At 8pm, Michael and his sisters Norah and Theresa 'Ellen', left home to attend a dance due {{to be held at}} the Gatton Hall. Arriving at 9pm, they found that the dance had been cancelled and began the return journey home, but failed to arrive. Early the following morning, Mrs. Murphy asked her son-in-law William M'Neill to go to Gatton to find out why they had not returned. Michael had borrowed M'Neill's sulky for the outing and while on the Tent-Hill road to Gatton, M'Neill recognised his sulky's distinctive tracks (the result of a <b>wobbling</b> <b>wheel)</b> turning off the road through a sliprail. M'Neill followed the tracks along a rough winding trail through wattle scrub for around [...]75 mi before finding his missing relatives.|$|R
40|$|<b>Wheel</b> shimmy and <b>wobble</b> {{are well}} known dynamic {{phenomena}} at automobiles, aeroplanes and motorcycles. This eigenmode excites in particular oscillations of the wheel about the steering axis, {{and it is no}} surprise, that unstable bicycle wobble is perceived unpleasant or may be dangerous, if not controlled by the rider in time. Basic research on wobble at motorcycles within the last decades has revealed a better understand-ing of reasons for the sudden onset of wobble, and the complex relations between parameters affecting wobble have been identified. These fundamental findings have been transferred to bicy-cles. As mass balances and inertial properties, rider influence and lateral compliances of tyre and frame do differ at bicycle and motorcycle, approved models to represent wobble at motorcycles have to prove themselves, when applied at bicycles. For that purpose numeric results are compared with measurements at test runs, and parametric influences on the stability of the wobble mode at bicycles have been evolved. All numeric analysis and measurements are based on a specific test bicycle equipped with a steering angle sensor, wheel-speed sensor, GPS and a 3 -axis accelerometer and angular velocity gyroscopic sensor...|$|R
