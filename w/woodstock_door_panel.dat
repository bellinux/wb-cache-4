40|$|This thesis {{work has}} been {{conducted}} at International Automotive Components Group in Torslanda, Sweden. The company produces <b>door</b> <b>panels,</b> instrument panels, consoles and cockpits for the automotive industry. During the production of <b>door</b> <b>panels,</b> defects such as pressure marks and scratches emerge which results in scrap and rework. The objective of the thesis work was to identify the causes of pressure marks and scratches and also to suggest measures {{to reduce the amount}} of scrap and rework on <b>door</b> <b>panels.</b> Through observations, interviews and experiments, several causes leading to pressure marks and scratches on <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> were identified. Small pieces of plastics on fixtures, the operator's rough handling and specific process steps are the main causes that result in pressure marks and scratches. Pressure marks and scratches emerge at several places on the <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> during the production. To reduce the amount of pressure marks and scratches both short-term and long-term measures were suggested. Some of the measures are:  Use vacuum cleaners at some stations  Add padding on unpadded areas and edges  Make new instructions that emphasize to keep production stations clean and to avoid rough handling  Introduce workshops to engage operator...|$|R

50|$|The 1972 {{models were}} {{very similar to the}} 1971 models, with the only change being the rear view mirror was glued to the {{windshield}} rather than bolted to top of the cab, and metal or vinyl-covered flat <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> were no longer available; all trim level <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> were molded plastic with integral armrests and wood grain inserts on Cheyenne and Sierra trim levels. For restoration, {{it should also be noted}} that the door and window cranks were slightly longer due to the molded plastic <b>door</b> <b>panels,</b> and the vent windows were now secured with a single screw on the inside of the door, thus differentiating it from the 1971 model year.|$|R

5000|$|The one single-ball mode not {{accounted}} for by the <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> is [...] "Battle the Power". The <b>door</b> <b>panel</b> by the same name merely lights the right ramp. To actually play the [...] "Battle the Power" [...] mode, the player must shoot the right ramp when the shot is lit and the Powerball is not in play. The ball moves to the raised triangular mini-playfield (the [...] "Powerfield") at the left edge of the main playfield, and the player must then direct the ball into the top hole within a set time limit. The Powerfield utilizes two medium-power magnets that act as flippers (dubbed [...] "Magna-Flips"). Points are awarded for hitting switches on the walls. If the ball falls through the bottom hole or time runs out, the player scores the points accumulated during the mode. If the player succeeds in shooting the ball through the top hole, the total is doubled and the currently highlighted <b>door</b> <b>panel</b> mode is started. (This will start [...] "Lost in the Zone" [...] if all <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> have been started.) ...|$|R
