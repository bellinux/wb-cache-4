50|$|Compared {{to other}} M models, {{there are only}} slight {{variations}} in standard and optional equipment for the M roadster, depending {{on the market and}} production date. Because all M roadsters have Nappa leather upholstery, air conditioning, power seats with two-stage heating and (from 9/98) a power-folding soft top, the list of options is short. In general, it included cruise control (standard in some markets), headlight <b>washers</b> (<b>not</b> offered in the U.S.), a removable body-color hardtop and various audio systems.|$|R

50|$|A look at {{the drawing}} of the dashpot {{arrangement}} will suggest that this problem is universal for all the coaches, whether a new coach or an old coach. Moreover, the provision of the liners below the Hytrel <b>washers</b> will <b>not</b> stop {{the damage to the}} lower spring seat and the protective tube.|$|R
50|$|The {{reason for}} {{replacement}} of the rubber washers with the hytrel washers was that the rubber <b>washers</b> were <b>not</b> lasting for the full Periodic overhaul cycle of the Railway Coaches which was one year.
