The {{corrosion}} {{behaviors of}} {{304 stainless steel}} (304 SS) <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> cut and 304 SS <b>which</b> <b>has</b> not <b>been</b> cut in two different solutions were investigated using polarization curve and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods. The results show that 304 SS <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> cut and 304 SS <b>which</b> <b>has</b> not <b>been</b> cut <b>have</b> the similar corrosion voltage in two different solutions. However, the corrosion velocity of 304 SS <b>which</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> cut is more than 304 SS <b>which</b> <b>has</b> not <b>been</b> cut both in the two solutions and the corrosion behaviors of two 304 SS in the water solution are better than in the water <b>which</b> <b>has</b> little oil...|$|R
