5|$|It {{was ordered}} into active duty {{military}} service on 1 September 1942 at Camp White, Oregon {{in preparation for}} deployment to Europe during World War II. During World War II, the regiment saw action in the European Theater, undertaking numerous bridging and mobility missions in Normandy, Northern France, the Rhineland and the Ardennes area. The Regiment was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation for its service during the war. After the war <b>was</b> <b>over</b> <b>in</b> 1945, the regiment remained in the country until it was inactivated on 17 June 1946 in Germany. A year later, on 27 May 1947 the regiment was reactivated with its Headquarters in Detroit, Michigan. It was again inactivated on 31 December 1948 in Detroit.|$|E
5|$|On 29 August 1526, Suleiman and {{his army}} broke through Hungary's {{southern}} defences. Louis and his entire government marched {{out with a}} small army of 20,000 men. The Battle of Mohács <b>was</b> <b>over</b> <b>in</b> less than two hours, with the entire Hungarian army virtually annihilated. Louis tried to flee the site of the battle but slipped from his frightened horse and drowned. Mary would mourn him {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E
5|$|On 6July 1553 King EdwardVI {{died and}} the Duke of Northumberland {{attempted}} to transfer the English Crown to Lady Jane Grey, who was married to his second youngest son, Guildford Dudley. Robert Dudley led a force of 300 into Norfolk where Mary Tudor was assembling her followers. After some ten days in the county and securing several towns for Jane, he took King's Lynn and proclaimed her in the market-place. The next day, 19July, Jane's reign <b>was</b> <b>over</b> <b>in</b> London. Soon, the townsmen of King's Lynn seized Robert Dudley {{and the rest of}} his small troop and sent him to Framlingham Castle before Mary I.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the coming}} years, several organisations, {{including}} the CIA and the West German Government, attempted to locate Bormann without success. In 1964, the West German government offered a reward of 100,000 Deutsche Marks for {{information leading to}} Bormann's capture. Sightings were reported at points all over the world, including Australia, Denmark, Italy, and South America. In his autobiography, Nazi intelligence officer Reinhard Gehlen claimed that Bormann had been a Soviet spy, and that he had escaped to Moscow. Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal believed that Bormann was living in South America. The West German government declared that its hunt for Bormann <b>was</b> <b>over</b> <b>in</b> 1971.|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{remained}} at Monterrey until late November 1847, {{when he set}} sail for home. While he would spend the following year {{in command of the}} Army's entire western division, his active military career <b>was</b> <b>over.</b> <b>In</b> December he received a hero's welcome in New Orleans and Baton Rouge, and his popular legacy {{set the stage for the}} 1848 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|Thaïs (1894), {{composed}} for Sanderson, was moderately received. Like Werther, it did {{not gain}} widespread popularity among French opera-goers until its first revival, which was {{four years after the}} premiere, by when the composer's association with Sanderson <b>was</b> <b>over.</b> <b>In</b> the same year he had a modest success in Paris with the one-act Le portrait de Manon at the Opéra-Comique, and a much greater one in London with La Navarraise at Covent Garden. The Times commented that in this piece Massenet had adopted the verismo style of such works as Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana to great effect. The audience clamoured for the composer to acknowledge the applause, but Massenet, always a shy man, declined to take even a single curtain call.|$|E

5|$|Fauré's new {{position}} left him better off financially. However, while he also {{became much more}} widely known as a composer, running the Conservatoire left him with no more time for composition than when he was struggling {{to earn a living}} as an organist and piano teacher. As soon as the working year <b>was</b> <b>over,</b> <b>in</b> the last days of July, he would leave Paris and spend the two months until early October in a hotel, usually by one of the Swiss lakes, to concentrate on composition. His works from this period include his lyric opera, Pénélope (1913), and some of his most characteristic later songs (e.g., the cycle La chanson d'Ève, Op. 95, completed in 1910) and piano pieces (Nocturnes Nos. 9–11; Barcarolles Nos. 7–11, written between 1906 and 1914).|$|E
5|$|On 7 August, a {{fleet of}} Persian rafts {{ferrying}} troops across the Bosphorus were surrounded and destroyed by Byzantine ships. The Slavs under the Avars attempted to attack the sea walls from across the Golden Horn, while the main Avar host attacked the land walls. Patrician Bonus' galleys rammed and destroyed the Slavic boats; the Avar land assault from August 6 to the 7th also failed. With the news that Theodore had decisively triumphed over Shahin (supposedly leading Shahin to die from depression), the Avars retreated to the Balkan hinterland within two days, never to seriously threaten Constantinople again. Even though the army of Shahrbaraz was still encamped at Chalcedon, the threat to Constantinople <b>was</b> <b>over.</b> <b>In</b> thanks for {{the lifting of the}} siege and the supposed divine protection of the Virgin Mary, the celebrated Akathist Hymn was written by an unknown author, possibly Patriarch Sergius or George of Pisidia.|$|E

These had fought through the Sicilian campaign and the assault landing in Italy in September. They now became permanent parts of the 50th (Northumbrian) Division. The divisional bridging platoon became an independent unit (as 15 Bridging Platoon) in August.|$|E

It fought at the Siege of Toulon (1793) and the capture of Corsica (1794), returning briefly to Northern Europe for the Battle of Egmont op Zee in the 1799 Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland, before fighting in the 1801 Egyptian campaign at the Battle of Aboukir and the Battle of Alexandria.|$|E
