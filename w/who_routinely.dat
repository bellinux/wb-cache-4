5|$|In 1859 Francis D'Arcy-Osborne, the Duke of Leeds, died, leaving Conisbrough to his nephew, Sackville Lane-Fox, the Baron Conyers. The keep {{remained}} in good condition, but by 1884 {{it was apparent}} that repairs were needed and the antiquarian George Clark recommended urgent work to repair the stonework. If finances allowed it, he also urged the reinstallation of a roof and wooden floors. Limited repairs were subsequently approved by the trustees of Lord Conyers, although Clark's colleague, A. Ellis, expressed concerns that railings to protect the visitors <b>who</b> <b>routinely</b> {{climbed to the top of}} the keep had not been funded. A reported £500 was spent by the trustees renovating the castle ruins, including the construction of a lodge in the outer bailey for the castle keeper, completed in 1885, and improvements to the footpaths.|$|E

Sources have stated that the opportunities for corruption are created by an inefficient administration and bureaucracy, along with poor record-keeping {{and a lack of}} transparency. Bribes are commonly demanded by government employees.|$|E
25|$|A known Brazilian psychic healer <b>who</b> <b>routinely</b> practiced psychic {{surgery was}} Zé Arigó, {{who claimed to}} be {{channeling}} for a deceased medical doctor of name Dr. Fritz. Unlike most other psychic healers, who work bare-handed, Arigó used a non-surgical blade. Other psychic healers who claimed to channel for Dr. Fritz were Edson Queiroz and Rubens Farias Jr.. Popular today (especially abroad) is João de Faria, also known as João de Deus, a quack operating in Abadiânia, state of Goiás.|$|E
50|$|The {{opposition}} Labour Party was riven by factionalism {{and divided}} over entryism - in particular, {{that of the}} Militant tendency.

25|$|Seldes {{spent the}} next ten years as an {{international}} reporter for the Chicago Tribune. He interviewed Lenin in 1922. He and three other reporters were expelled in 1923 when Soviet authorities, <b>who</b> <b>routinely</b> censored foreign reporters' telegraphed dispatches, found articles by the four reporters, disguised as personal letters, being smuggled out in a diplomatic mailpouch to avoid censorship. The expulsion was facilitated, according to Seldes, after his publisher, Colonel Robert McCormick, failed to show sufficient respect when writing to the Soviets to protest censorship.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} album {{version and}} subsequent radio edit {{of the song}} had a much slower tempo than the more well-known remixes and was essentially structured like a pop song, with the characteristic synthetic instrumentation of the more melodic side of ambient music — though including darker overtones, such as the prominently featured Gregorian chant (Gloria in Excelsis Deo). This last element often invites comparison to popular ambient/new age/world music projects of the 1990s like Enigma and Deep Forest <b>who</b> <b>routinely</b> sample chants from various ethnicities worldwide, though in contrast such vocals featured on Karma were all original recordings.|$|E
25|$|Spain {{had long}} {{rejected}} repeated American efforts to purchase Florida. But by 1818, Spain {{was facing a}} troubling colonial {{situation in which the}} cession of Florida made sense. Spain had been exhausted by the Peninsular War in Europe and needed to rebuild its credibility and presence in its colonies. Revolutionaries in Central America and South America were beginning to demand independence. Spain was unwilling to invest further in Florida, encroached on by American settlers, and it worried about the border between New Spain and the United States. With only a minor military presence in Florida, Spain was not able to restrain the Seminole warriors <b>who</b> <b>routinely</b> crossed the border and raided American villages and farms, as well as protected southern slave refugees from slave owners and traders of the southern United States.|$|E

25|$|Griffith stunned many {{unfamiliar}} with his A Face in the Crowd {{work in the}} television film Crime of Innocence (1985), where he portrayed a callous judge <b>who</b> <b>routinely</b> sentenced juveniles to hard prison time. Also noteworthy in Griffith's darker roles was his character in Under the Influence (1986), a TV-movie where Griffith played an alcoholic, abusive patriarch. He further surprised audiences with {{his role as a}} dangerous and mysterious grandfather in the television film Gramps (1995) co-starring John Ritter. He also appeared as a comical villain in the spy movie spoof Spy Hard (1996) starring Leslie Nielsen. In the television film A Holiday Romance (1999), Griffith played the role of Jake Peterson. In the film Daddy and Them (2001), Griffith portrayed a patriarch of a dysfunctional southern family.|$|E
25|$|Due to fear of an {{outbreak}} of epidemic typhus, the US Government put a typhus quarantine in place in 1917 across {{the entirety of the}} US-Mexican border. Sanitation plants were constructed that required immigrants to be thoroughly inspected and bathed before crossing the border. Those <b>who</b> <b>routinely</b> crossed {{back and forth across the}} border for work were required to go through the sanitation process weekly, updating their quarantine card with the date of the next week’s sanitation. These sanitation border stations remained active over the next two decades, regardless of the disappearance of the typhus threat. This fear of typhus and resulting quarantine and sanitation protocols dramatically hardened the border between the US and Mexico, fostering scientific and popular prejudices against Mexicans. This ultimately intensified racial tensions and fueled efforts to ban immigrants to the US from the Southern Hemisphere because the immigrants were associated with the disease.|$|E

Even very small differences in the length and angles of bones can have a major affect on performance. Secretariat was well put together even as a two-year-old, {{and by the time}} he was three, he had further matured in body and smoothed out his gait. The New York Racing Association's Dr. M. A.

50|$|Jobber is a {{professional}} wrestling term used to describe a wrestler <b>who</b> is <b>routinely</b> defeated by main eventers, mid-carders, or low-carders.

500|$|Burger King changed {{ownership}} in 2002 when Diageo sold its {{interest in the}} company {{to a group of}} investment firms led by TPG Capital. After assuming ownership, TPG's newly appointed management team began focusing menu development and advertising on a very narrow demographic group, young men aged 20–34 <b>who</b> <b>routinely</b> ate at fast food restaurants several times per month which the chain identified as the [...] "super fan". Amid this new super-fan focused menu expansion the chain introduced its new BK Stacker sandwich in late 2006, a family of sandwiches featuring the same set of toppings served as a single, double, triple or quadruple hamburger. The Stacker line was part of a series of larger, more calorie-laden products introduced by the company to entice the super-fan into the chain's restaurants. These new additions helped propel same store profits for more than sixteen quarters.|$|E
500|$|Unpaid labour {{is still}} a {{practice}} in Haiti. As many as half a million children are unpaid domestic servants called restaveks, <b>who</b> <b>routinely</b> suffer physical and sexual abuse. Additionally, human trafficking, including child trafficking is a significant problem in Haiti; trafficked people are brought into, out of, and through Haiti for forced labor, including sex trafficking. [...] The groups most at risk include the poor, women, children, the homeless, and people migrating across the border with the Dominican Republic. The devastating earthquake in 2010 displaced many, rendering them homeless, isolated, and supremely vulnerable to exploitation by traffickers. [...] The chaos following the quake also distracted authorities and hindered efforts to stop trafficking. The government has taken steps to prevent and stop trafficking, ratifying human rights conventions and enacting laws to protect the vulnerable, but enforcement remains difficult.|$|E

500|$|Criticizing Tolle, James Beverley, {{professor}} of Christian Thought and Ethics at the evangelical Tyndale Seminary in Toronto, says that Tolle's worldview [...] "is {{at odds with}} central Christian convictions" [...] and that [...] "Tolle denies the core of Christianity by claiming there is no ultimate distinction between humans and God and Jesus". John Stackhouse, a {{professor of}} theology and culture at evangelical Regent College in Vancouver, says that he [...] "gives a certain {{segment of the population}} exactly what they want: a sort of supreme religion that purports to draw from all sorts of lesser, that is, established religions". Stackhouse has described him as one of several spiritual teachers who [...] "purport to have investigated the world’s religions (quite a claim) and found them wanting, <b>who</b> <b>routinely</b> subject those religions to withering criticism, and who then champion their own views as superior to all these alternatives".|$|E

500|$|After {{arriving}} {{at his new}} professorship in Atlanta, Du Bois wrote {{a series of articles}} generally supportive of Marxism. He was not a strong proponent of labor unions or the Communist Party, but he felt that Marx's scientific explanation of society and the economy were useful for explaining the situation of African Americans in the United States. Marx's atheism also struck a chord with Du Bois, <b>who</b> <b>routinely</b> criticized black churches for dulling blacks' sensitivity to racism. In his 1933 writings, Du Bois embraced socialism, but asserted that [...] "olored labor has no common ground with white labor", a controversial position that was rooted in Du Bois's dislike of American labor unions, which had systematically excluded blacks for decades.Lewis, p. 551. Du Bois did not support the Communist Party in the U.S. and did not vote for their candidate in the 1932 presidential election, in spite of an African American on their ticket.|$|E
