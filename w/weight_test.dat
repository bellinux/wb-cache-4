40|$|This report {{considers}} {{the topic of}} media weight testing: that is,the examination {{of the effect of}} different levels of media advertising spending on behaviour in the market. In a simple test, for example, the level of expenditure is increased above normal in one area and the sales, brand shares or attitudes in that area are compared to those in other, comparable areas where normal weights of advertising are maintained. Although media <b>weight</b> <b>tests</b> are a much practised marketing exercise they would seem rarely to produce conclusive, or useful results. The MCRU has found that within the body of experiences of Sponsor companies only about one in twenty media <b>weight</b> <b>tests</b> have produced conclusive results. Similarly, discussion with other market researchers has suggested the same order of magnitude for the success ration. Also a study reported by Clancy (1972, 1638) suggests the situation is not much better in the U. S. A. In order to formulate guidelines for successfully conducting media <b>weight</b> <b>tests,</b> it is necessary to establish, illustrate and understand the reasons giving rise to the usual failures. These reasons can be categorised in two ways: A - statistical, quantifiable reasons B - conceptual and managerial reasons, which tend to be less easily quantifiable After the problem has been defined, this report is set out in three parts:¬ Part A considers and establishes why the circumstances of the market place may render it unlikely that many media <b>weight</b> <b>tests</b> will produce any detectable changes in the market place; Part B {{considers the}} market and organisational context in which this sort of exercise is usually conducted and against which it has to be assessed; and Part C discuss the implications of these findings and presents guidelines for successful media <b>weight</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R

The cores used in {{this research}} is waste (dry leaves, HDPE plastic, newspapers), corrugated cardboard, sengon laut wood (albazia falcataria) and polyurethane foam (PU Foam). The skin is made from the angle interlock woven of cantula 3 D fiber with unsaturated polyester Yukalac® 157 BQTNEX resin matrik. The composite is made with hand lay up method with cantula fiber weight measurement 0, 4. Charpy impact testing based on ASTM D 5942 to investigate charpy impact strength of cantula 3 D sandwich composite. Meanwhile drop <b>weight</b> <b>testing</b> to investigate the toughness of sandwich composite repeatly weight. The result of this research shows that sandwich composite with the highest impact strength does not become the strongest in the drop <b>weight</b> <b>testing.</b> In charpy impact testing, the sengon laut core has highest average impact strength 92, 66 kJ/m 2, but in drop <b>weight</b> <b>testing,</b> sengon laut core only endure until impact between 4060 times from 100 times impact that has been done to other types of core. The difference of the impact strength is caused by impact fatigue factor and the ability of deformation of the core.

5000|$|The Snowboard Shelf - The {{contestant}}s {{must take}} four snowboards {{and build a}} shelf out of them. Each contestant is given at random one of five different shelf designs, which they must follow. Angela's shelves are assembled with threaded rods, Cory's shelves are ceiling mounted, Simon's shelves are a corner unit that is supported with threaded rods {{on one side and}} a board on the other, Deen's a [...] "pagoda-style" [...] unit, and Matt's design is a more conventional shelf supported by wood and dado joints on both sides. Cory is initially frustrated with the fact that his shelves run perpendicular to how the ceiling joists are run. He uses one snowboard as strapping, but hanging the other three snowboards causes him to get frustrated and fail. Angela fails after trying to notch the room's baseboards with a chainsaw near an electrical outlet in order to make room for the lowest shelf, though her shelf is also not attached to the wall. Deen, after staring at a [...] "dry fit" [...] for some time and not noticing that one shelf bows as a result, manages to fix his error and finish his shelf without Doug's assistance. As for Matt, he uses his snowboards upside down for his shelves, which promptly earns him a fail when his shelves start to bow under a <b>weight</b> <b>test.</b> Simon had arguably the most complicated design, but he manages, with Joey's assistance, to guide it to a pass.|$|E
