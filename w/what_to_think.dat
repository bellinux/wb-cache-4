5|$|Adaptation {{had been}} in {{development}} {{as far back as}} 1994. Jonathan Demme brought the project to Columbia Pictures with Kaufman writing the script. Kaufman experienced writer's block and did not know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of The Orchid Thief. Finally he wrote a script based on his experience of adapting the book into a screenplay. Jonze signed to direct, and filming was finished in June 2001. Though the film is billed as an adaptation of The Orchid Thief, its primary narrative focus is Charlie Kaufman's struggle to adapt The Orchid Thief into a film, while dramatizing the events of the book in parallel. Adaptation also adds a number of fictitious elements, including Kaufman's twin brother (also credited as a writer for the film) and a romance between Orlean and Laroche, and culminates in completely invented events including fictional versions of Orlean and Laroche three years after the events related in The Orchid Thief.|$|E
5|$|Grappling {{with family}} challenges, Vonnegut {{continued}} to write, publishing novels vastly dissimilar {{in terms of}} plot. The Sirens of Titan (1959) features a Martian invasion of Earth, as experienced by a bored billionaire, Malachi Constant. He meets Winston Rumfoord, an aristocratic space traveler, who is virtually omniscient but stuck in a time warp {{that allows him to}} appear on Earth every 59 days. The billionaire learns that his actions and the events of all of history are determined by a race of robotic aliens from the planet Tralfamadore, who need a replacement part that can only be produced by an advanced civilization in order to repair their spaceship and return home—human history has been manipulated to produce it. Some human structures, such as the Kremlin, are coded signals from the aliens to their ship as to how long it may expect to wait for the repair to take place. Reviewers were uncertain <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the book, with one comparing it to Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann.|$|E

[...] "I was unsure <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it, but I found it very odd", he told The Washington Post. He said that he [...] "later reexamined it and started noticing the 'codes' and letters hidden all around the video".|$|E

500|$|Wilson {{was brought}} on board to {{continue}} rewriting work with McDowell, though Burton replaced McDowell and Wilson with Skaaren due to creative differences. Burton's original choice for Betelgeuse was Sammy Davis, Jr., but Geffen suggested Keaton. Burton was unfamiliar with Keaton's work, but was quickly convinced. Burton cast Ryder upon seeing her in Lucas. O'Hara quickly signed on, while Burton claimed {{it took a}} lot of time to convince other cast members to sign, as [...] "they didn't know <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the weird script." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Misery" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Gwen Stefani for her third solo studio album, This Is What the Truth Feels Like (2016). Initially released as a promotional single, it became the record's third and final single on May 23, 2016, when it was sent to hot adult contemporary radio. Stefani co-wrote the song with Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Mattias Larsson, and Robin Frediksson, with the latter two serving as the producers. An electropop song, [...] "Misery" [...] uses digital hand clapping and an upbeat samba to produce a futuristic-sounding melody. The lyrics describe a lover who has recently started a relationship and is confused over <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about it. Several critics drew comparisons between these lyrics to Stefani's personal and romantic life with her boyfriend, Blake Shelton.|$|E
500|$|The {{cast and}} filmmakers {{attended}} several press conferences {{that allowed them}} to address issues surrounding the film, including its authenticity, Alan Moore's reaction to it and its intended political message. The film was intended to be a departure from some of Moore's original themes. In the words of Hugo Weaving: [...] "Alan Moore was writing about something which happened some time ago. It was a response to living in Thatcherite Britain... This is a response to {{the world in which we}} live today. So I think that the film and the graphic novel are two separate entities." [...] Regarding the film's controversial political content, the filmmakers have said that the film is intended more to raise questions and add to a dialogue already present in society, rather than provide answers or tell viewers <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b>|$|E

500|$|... "The Same Old Story" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. TV Squad writer Jane Boursaw thought the episode seemed [...] "all over the place", and wasn't sure <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> She stated {{the two most}} interesting parts of the episode were when Walter removed the girl's eye in order to identity her killer, and the cliffhanger at the very end, when Walter states [...] "If you've read my file, then you know the truth about Peter's medical history". Travis Fickett of IGN thought {{it was better than}} the pilot; though it was [...] "laden with lots of clunky exposition and clichéd dialogue," [...] Fickett understood that it was needed to acquaint new viewers to the show. Fickett concluded his review by saying Fringe {{has the potential to be}} a [...] "great show", and he also praised the production level as [...] "top notch", and Torv's performance as [...] "very good" [...] as she [...] "brings a unique presence to the show". The A.V. Club critic Noel Murray gave the episode a C+, while Television Without Pity graded it with a B.|$|E
500|$|After what he {{felt was}} a period of bad episodes {{culminating}} with [...] "Stranger in a Strange Land", critic Andrew Dignan of Slant Magazine praised [...] "Tricia Tanaka Is Dead" [...] as a [...] "palate cleanser, reminding us that this show is meant to be, above all else, fun". He described the episode as an [...] "expected pleasure, disarming in a way [...] hasn't been since Season One, back before these people became jaded by [...] "Others" [...] and consumed with tedious busy work while the show's producers figured out what frequently disappointing direction to push them in next." [...] Dignan did however acknowledge that others might not have found the episode as enjoyable as he did. Erin Martell of TV Squad wasn't sure <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the episode, believing that it was [...] "entertaining" [...] but produced nothing new for viewers. She did note that the characters are now in place to take action for following episodes, and hoped that the episode's [...] "slow-moving events" [...] were [...] "building up to some serious resolution". Rather than dismiss the episode for lacking a mythology-related storyline, Jeff Jensen from Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "a joyous and poignant hour of television", and said that it [...] "could very well be a cleverly crafted allegory for the history of The Dharma Initiative on The Island." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Jane Boursaw of TV Squad wasn't sure <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about [...] "The Bishop Revival", but loved the plotline about Walter's dad being a German spy {{working for the}} US government. Alternately, Annalee Newitz of io9 called the episode [...] "surprisingly meh"; while appreciating [...] "all the weird family revelations about the Bishops", she believed the revelations about Walter's father to be [...] "too much" [...] because [...] "we didn't need that extra backstory". Newitz wished Fringe had brought back Olivia's childhood subplot and its ties with Walter and Peter. The A.V. Club columnist Noel Murray was also critical of the episode, explaining [...] "Plotwise, there wasn't much going on in 'The Bishop Revival.'... The FD tracked down a criminal and felled that criminal; that's really it." [...] Murray did however praise the killer's methods and [...] "Aryan aloofness" [...] as [...] "cool" [...] and [...] "delightfully old-school". Like Newitz, Tim Grierson of the magazine New York believed the episode contained [...] "stupid revelations"; for instance, the Nazi connection of Walter's father [...] "just felt like a variation on season one's episodes in which bizarre phenomena could always magically be linked back to Walter's work for the government. Obviously, this info about Peter's grandfather {{was supposed to be}} 'shocking,' showing how the Bishop family's scientific work can so easily be perverted for evil, but by this point it just seems like a very artificial, unnecessary ploy to keep us engaged." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stephen Farber of The Hollywood Reporter gave a {{positive}} review and said, [...] "Scott {{did a great}} job reviving the Roman sand-and-sandals epic when he made the Oscar-winning Gladiator. This Egyptian saga is not quite in the same league, but it confirms the director's flair of widescreen imagery. Exodus has the added kick of 3D technology, and it has enough eye-popping set pieces to please adventure fans." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was positive of the film and said, [...] "Exodus is a biblical epic that comes at you at maximum velocity but stays stirringly, inspiringly human." [...] Reagan Gavin Rasquinha of The Times of India gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and said, [...] "Exodus: Gods and Kings is 'spectacle' with a capital 'S' and in more ways than one, definitely epic." [...] Catherine Shoard of The Guardian gave 3 out of 5 stars and said, [...] "It’s impossible not to feel some awe at the spectacle, but more shocks would have helped see you through the two-and-a-half hour running time." [...] Phillips Hawker of The Sydney Morning Herald gave a mixed review and awarded the film 3 out of 5 stars, saying, [...] "Exodus: Gods And Kings... lacks Gladiator's full-on intensity and committed central performances, however; it's a mixture of the grand and the bland, and when it's not spectacular it's a little plodding." [...] Justin Chang of Variety said, [...] "Some may well desire a purer, fuller version of the story, one more faithful to the text and less clearly shaped by the demands of the Hollywood blockbuster. But on its own grand, imperfect terms, [...] "Exodus: Gods and Kings" [...] is undeniably transporting, marked by a free-flowing visual splendor that plays to its creator’s unique strengths: Given how many faith-based movies are content to tell their audiences <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> or feel, it’s satisfying to see one whose images alone are enough to compel awestruck belief." [...] Jim Vejvoda of IGN said, [...] "Director Ridley Scott gets lost in the desert at times in Exodus: Gods and Kings, his epic, but not entirely effective take on the story of Moses' journey from Prince of Egypt to Hebrew leader." ...|$|E
