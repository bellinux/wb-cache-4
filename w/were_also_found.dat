A row of rooms from an earlier, 1st century BCE to 1st century CE {{fortress}} revealed artefacts pointing to a Nabatæan occupation predating Roman annexation. Coins bearing the likeness of Nabatæan kings were found, along with storage jars and other vessels.|$|E
5|$|Analysis {{of antiquities}} related to {{skeletal}} remains revealed 12 species of domesticated and wild animals: cattle, buffaloes (Bubalisbubalis linn), sheep (Ovis aries), cheetal (Axis axis), barasinga, pig, elephant, rhinoceros, cheetal (Axis axia), dog, a carp and {{two types of}} turtles.

5|$|In 1913 {{the crystal}} {{structure}} of sodium chloride {{was determined by}} William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg. This revealed that there were six equidistant nearest-neighbours for each atom, demonstrating that the constituents were not arranged in molecules or finite aggregates, but instead as a network with long-range crystalline order. Many other inorganic compounds <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> to have similar structural features. These compounds were soon described as being constituted of ions rather than neutral atoms, but proof of this hypothesis was not found until the mid-1920s, when X-ray reflection experiments (which detect the density of electrons), were performed.|$|E
5|$|In October 2002, a salvage {{excavation}} {{was conducted}} at the site {{on behalf of the}} Israel Antiquities Authority. Finds include a large building, numerous potsherds from the Late Roman period, a bronze coin from the first or second century CE, remains of an ancient olive press, glass vessels such as a wine goblet and bottles dated to the Late Byzantine and Umayyad periods (seventh and first half of eighth centuries CE) and an underground water reservoir. A few potsherds from the Crusader and Mamluk periods <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>found.</b>|$|E
5|$|Loss of cell {{viability}} in the jack jumper's venom was researched through cytometry, which measures {{the proportions of}} cells that glow {{in the presence of}} fluorescent dye and 7-Aminoactinomycin D. Examinations of the rapidly reproducing Epstein–Barr B-cells showed that the cells lost viability within minutes when exposed to pilosulin 1. Normal white blood cells <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> to alter easily when exposed to pilosulin 1. However, partial peptides of pilosulin 1 were less efficient at lowering {{cell viability}}; the residue 22 N-terminal plays a critical role in the cytotoxic activity of pilosulin 1.|$|E
50|$|Mort is a surname {{or family}} {{name in the}} United Kingdom, {{traditionally}} found in North West England, especially Lancashire. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> in the counties of Glamorganshire, Monmouthshire in South Wales, but <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> {{in many areas of}} the United Kingdom.

5|$|More than 1,400 gastroliths (stomach stones, 8 to 87mm in size) {{were found}} among the ribs and gastralia of {{specimen}} MPC-D100/127. The ratio of gastrolith mass to total weight, 0.0022, supports the theory that these gastroliths helped the toothless animals in grinding their food. Features such {{as the presence of}} a beak and a U-shaped, downturned jaw, are indicators of facultative (optional) herbivory among coelurosaurian theropods. In spite of these features, fish vertebrae and scales <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> among the gastroliths, which suggests that it was an omnivore. Ornithomimosaurs in general are thought to have fed on both plants and small animals.|$|E
5|$|Mumbai police {{department}} originally identified 37 suspects—including two army officers—for their alleged {{involvement in the}} plot.

One of these men, Pakistani American David Headley (born Daood Sayed Gilani), was found to have made several trips to India before the attacks and gathered video and GPS information on behalf of the plotters.|$|E
5|$|Murray cod, like {{a number}} of other Murray-Darling native fish species, have also managed to cross the Great Dividing Range at least once through natural river capture events, leading to several species and {{subspecies}} of coastal cod. The best known are eastern freshwater cod of the Clarence River system in northern New South Wales, and Mary River cod of the Mary River system in south eastern Queensland, both of which are endangered, but survive today. Coastal cod <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> in the Richmond River system in northern New South Wales and the Brisbane River system in southern Queensland, but are now extinct.|$|E

5|$|Remains {{similar to}} the American white ibis {{have been found in}} Middle Pliocene {{deposits}} of the Bone Valley formation in central Florida, and Lower Pliocene deposits of the Yorktown Formation at Lee Creek in North Carolina. Two species, one living and one extinct, have been recovered from the Talara Tar Seeps in northern coastal Peru. Eudocimus peruvianus was described from a tarsometatarsus that differed slightly from E.albus, whose remains <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> there. Remains of neither species are common in the beds. The tar seeps have been dated at 13,900 years old. The American white ibis is still found in Peru.|$|E
5|$|The Newstead Helmet, {{found at}} the Roman fort in Newstead, near Melrose in Roxburghshire, {{is one of the}} most {{impressive}} of many finds of Roman arms and armour. The Staffordshire Moorlands Pan is a second-century Romano-British trulla apparently decorated as a souvenir for a soldier who had served on Hadrian's Wall, and probably made locally. A number of items <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> in the Sculptor's Cave, Coversea in Morayshire, including Roman pottery, rings, bracelets, needles and coins, some of which had been re-used for ornaments.|$|E
5|$|The first {{policeman}} {{to arrive}} on the scene noticed wires running from the van's dashboard through a hole into the back and {{reported that he had}} found the bomb. Forensic experts later estimated that the bomb weighed 1,500–1,600 kg (3,300–3,500 lb) and was a mixture of semtex, a military-grade plastic explosive, and ammonium nitrate fertiliser, a cheap and easily obtainable explosive used extensively by the IRA. Components of what may have been a tremble trigger <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> later, designed to detonate the bomb if it was tampered with.|$|E

5|$|The most clues for {{a minimal}} Sudoku is {{believed}} to be 40, of which only two are known. If any clue is removed from either of these Sudokus, the puzzle would have more than one solution (and thus not be a proper Sudoku). These two Sudokus were discovered in 2014, more than four years after at least one programmer expressed doubts that a 40-clue minimal Sudoku would exist. In the work to find these Sudokus, other high-clue puzzles were catalogued, including more than 6,500,000,000 minimal puzzles with 36-clues. About 2600 minimal Sudokus with 39-clues <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>found.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of seals of Shepseskare in the oldest part of Neferefre's mortuary temple could {{indicate that the}} former also undertook construction works there. The evidence for such works is uncertain: these seals could have been placed on boxes which were later moved into the magazine rooms of the temple. For example, seals of Userkaf, Sahure and Neferirkare Kakai <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> in the temple, while these three pharaohs died before Neferefre's reign.|$|E
