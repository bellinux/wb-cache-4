50|$|While {{frequent}} throughout Europe {{during the}} Medieval period and before, <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> have largely disappeared. <b>Wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> originated from {{the practices of}} hunter-gatherer communities.

40|$|In the Laelatu <b>wooded</b> <b>meadow</b> in Estonia, {{famous for}} its {{phanerogam}} diversity, the bryophyte community has been investigated in order to compare its flora and diversity relationships {{with those of the}} vascular plant community. Ninety-six bryophyte species were found, 13 of them are hepatics; the majority of the bryophytes are epigeic species common to meadows and forests, including many calciphilous species. Vascular plants and bryophytes display opposite responses to fertilisation. For vascular plants, fertilisation increases the coverage and diminishes the number of species, while for bryophytes it diminishes coverage and increases the number of species. The relationship between the number of species in small plots and the total number of species in the area is similar for vascular plants and bryophytes. No significant changes in the bryophyte community in Laelatu <b>wooded</b> <b>meadow</b> has been detected during the last 30 years. Nomenclature: For bryophytes Ingerpuu et al.

The nature reserve is important for its great biodiversity. As regards to the flora, the nature reserve is home to the Rhinanthus osiliensis, a species of rattle which can only be found on Saaremaa and Gotland islands in the Baltic Sea. Other notable species include red helleborine, marsh helleborine, Kashubian vetch and rock whitebeam. The bird life is rich with species like black woodpecker, Eurasian pygmy owl, black stork and white-tailed eagle as typical representatives. Mammals such as elk and wild boar are frequent in the area. Facilities for visitors include bird watching towers, hiking trails with information boards and a visitor centre.|$|E
50|$|On {{a stretch}} {{of just a few}} {{kilometers}} there are four different hardiness zones and extensive biodiversity. Lake Vättern has a clear influence on the local climate, with cold springs, but long, mild autumns. Because of this, several post-glacial warming relicts have been able to survive in the region and in the slopes down to Lake Vättern, which have an oceanic climate. For example, the only incidence in all Scandinavia of the symbolic species Ena montana, the Bulin snail, occurs in the ravine environments near the lake. Gisebo and Gränna are home to one of the country’s largest fruit growing districts, which is not common at this latitude and altitude. Due to the central location of the East Vättern Scarp Landscape in the southern one-third of Sweden, both eastern and western species are found here, as well as typically northern coniferous forest environments and typically southern Swedish <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows.</b> From a macro perspective, the East Vättern Scarp Landscape {{can be seen as a}} large border zone that gradually transitions from more open, broadleaf-dominated landscapes near the lake to more dense wooded landscapes on the South Swedish Highlands. For this reason, the hazel dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) has been named the symbolic species for these environments.|$|E

50|$|Matsalu National Park {{covers a}} total area of 486.1 km2, {{encompassing}} Matsalu Bay {{along with the}} delta of the Kasari River and its surrounding areas — floodplains, coastal meadows, reedbeds, woodlands, <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows,</b> and the section of Väinameri around {{the mouth of the}} bay, which includes more than 50 islands. 224.3 km2 of the protected area is terrestrial and 261.8 km2 is aquatic. Matsalu Bay is shallow, brackish and rich in nutrients. The bay is 18 km long and 6 km wide, but has an average depth of only 1.5 m and a maximum depth of 3.5 m. Water salinity is approximately 0.7 per mil. Shoreline length of the bay is about 165 km. The bay's shoreline lacks high banks and is populated mostly with shingle shores, with muddy and overgrown reed in the innermost, sheltered part of the bay.Kasari River is the biggest of several rivers that run into Matsalu Bay. The delta of the Kasari River is not in its natural condition due to dredging between 1930 and 1960; the alluvial meadow of the delta (40 km2), most of which is actively managed, {{is one of the biggest}} open wet meadows in Europe. Reeds and rushes surrounding the main channel expand westwards up to 100 m every year. Annual inflow into the Matsalu Bay from the Kasari River exceeds the volume of the bay itself approximately eight times; average seasonal variation of the Kasari River exceeds 1.7 m. The rivers carry large quantities of nutrient-rich sediments into the bay from an over 3500 km2 drainage basin. The sediments are deposited in river estuaries, allowing reedbeds to expand.|$|E
50|$|More than 10,000 {{years ago}} the first parts of Saaremaa arose from the Baltic Ice Lake. The uplift of the Earth's crust is {{continuing}} even today, at 2 mm per year. The West Estonian islands are lowlying plains resting on limestone, their average elevation being about 15 m above sea level. Limestone has become denuded in {{a great number of}} places, resulting in cliffs, limestone pits and quarries at Mustjala, Ninase, Pulli, Üügu and Kaugatuma. Because of its mild maritime climate and a variety of soils, Saaremaa has a rich flora, illustrated by the fact that 80% of the plant species found in Estonia are represented here. Altogether 1200 species of vascular plants can be found in Saaremaa. About 120 of the local plant species are rare ones which have received special protection status. The most famous endemic species is Rhinanthus osiliensis, a rare little flower growing mostly in spring fens. Rare and beautiful flowers are widespread; out of the 36 species found in Estonia, 35 of them are found on Saaremaa and neighbouring islands. Over 40% of Saaremaa is covered with forests. They are mostly mixed forests but in some areas one can also find broad-leaved (deciduous) trees, which are relict plant communities of former milder climatic periods. <b>Wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> were still common in Saaremaa before World War II, but many of these unique natural complexes have gradually become overgrown and thus turned into the ordinary forest. The same is true for alvars (limestone areas covered with thin soil and stunted vegetation). Once a typical and exclusive landscape element in Saaremaa alvars are now in decline. Nature conservation planning for Saaremaa now includes protection {{of the largest and most}} unusual alvar areas.|$|E
40|$|We {{provide an}} {{overview}} of the amount and ecological condition of <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> throughout Estonia after significant changes in agriculture {{in the second part of}} 20 th century. We also present the first attempt to estimate the success of recent conservation efforts for <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows.</b> Our analysis is based on recent exhaustive inventories. We found that Estonia, despite a decrease of the area in <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> by two orders of magnitude during the 20 th century, still has about 8400 ha remaining of which approximately 5800 ha are meadows with, at the least, an intermediate conservation value. The latter is directly dependent on mowing regime. Efforts to preserve <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> include establishment of protected areas and financial support for mowing. The national conservation subsidy has been useful and supportive for <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows,</b> however the total amount of this subsidy has been small compared to the area that could be supported. The much larger funds of agri-environmental subsidies have largely not been available for <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows.</b> Moreover, there has been no record keeping about subsidisation of semi-natural grasslands using agricultural support schemes. Although the preservation of some good examples of <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> in Estonia seems guaranteed, further degradation of this valuable habitat type on a national scale is very probable. ...|$|E

40|$|Gotland is {{the richest}} {{place in the}} world when it comes to <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows.</b> Traditional {{management}} with haymaking and raking for centuries have turned <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> into exceptionally species rich habitats in the agricultural landscape. Since the early 1900 ’s the area of managed meadows has decreased rapidly. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate if there are differences between continuously managed areas and areas that had been left out, in Lojsta and Gerum on southern Gotland. The results show that there are significant differences in species diversity between the two types of management in both meadows. There was also a relationship between the two parameters temperature and growth. The conclusion of this study is that if it is of interest to conserve <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> with all its species, it is important to continue with the yearly cycle of traditional management...|$|E
40|$|The epiphytic lichen {{communities}} in open and overgrown <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> in Estonia were examined. From 29 study stands, 179 taxa of lichens, lichenicolous and allied fungi were identified, 41 {{of them are}} nationally rare, red-listed or protected. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) was performed to examine the main gradients in species composition and to relate these gradients to environmental variables. The response of lichen species richness {{to the influence of}} the environmental variables was tested using a general linear mixed model (GLMM). We revealed that overgrowing of <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> caused significant changes in lichen communities on trees: richness of lichen species decreased and the composition of species changed. Photophilous lichen communities with many species of macrolichens in open <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> were replaced with associations of more shade-tolerant microlichen species. The composition of epiphytic lichen communities were also influenced by the tree species composition, diameter of trees and the geographical location of the stand. ...|$|E

40|$|Soil horizons Species {{richness}} extrapolation a b s t r a c t <b>Wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> are seminatural plant {{communities that}} support high diversity of various taxa. Due {{to changes in}} land use, <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> have severely declined during the last century. The dominant trees in <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> acquire mineral nutrients via ectomycor-rhizal fungi. Using anatomotyping and sequencing of root tips, interpolation and extrapola-tion methods, we studied the diversity and community structure of ectomycorrhizal fungi in two soil horizons of both managed and forested parts of a wooded meadow in Estonia. Species of Thelephoraceae, Sebacinaceae and the genus Inocybe dominated the whole ectomy-corrhizal fungal community of 172 observed species. Forested and managed parts of the wooded meadow harboured different communities of ectomycorrhizal fungi, whereas soil horizon had a negligible effect on the fungal community composition. Diverse soil condi-tions and host trees likely support the high richness of ectomycorrhizal fungi in the wooded meadow ecosystem. Direct sequencing integrated with interpolation and extrapolation methods are promising to identify the fungi at the species level and to compare species rich-ness between communities of ectomycorrhizal fungi...|$|E

Today. nearly all of these meadows have been abandoned and became rapidly overgrown by deciduous shrub and tree species forming a closed canopy which resulted in a rapid and strong decrease in species numbers of the herb layer. Recent efforts aim to restore overgrown <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> by cutting single shrubs and trees to open the canopy. However, the effects of abandonment as well as of any restoration management in <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> have rarely been documented until now. Mechanisms driving succession after restoration such as the dispersal potential of the respective species over time and space have not been analysed yet. Therefore, a chronosequence was studied which included a traditionally managed wooded meadow, an overgrown meadow which has been abandoned for more that) 100 yr and a meadow which was restored 36 yr ago by cutting and is now grazed. We analysed the soil seed bank of the 3 meadows in comparison with the established vegetation and endozoochorous seed dispersal by cattle and sheep, After abandonment 87 % of the typical grassland species vanished from the established vegetation and were replaced by species characteristic of woodland and disturbed grassland communities. The mean number of species decreased from 52 species per plot (4 m(2)) to 18 species. Mean species number and number of seeds in the seed bank declined significantly from the traditionally managed to the overgrown meadow. Most of the grassland species were assigned to a transient seed bank type while only 1 / 3 could be classified as having a short-term persistent seed bank. Thus. restoration of <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> cannot rely on the soil seed bank. Endozoochorous seed dispersal by cattle and sheep was shown for 15 % of the species with seed densities per 100 g air dried dung of 737 and 767. respectively. Movement of animals between ancient and restored <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> is recommended since many of the species only occurred in low densities and therefore, will probably not be found in the dung samples...|$|E
40|$|The Swedish {{countryside}} at {{the beginning}} of the nineteenth century was still so varied and rich that there was room for both human beings and animals almost everywhere. It is true that for thousands of years man had struggled with the advancing forests. First the primaeval deciduous forest was cleared during the warm period following the last glaciation, and after the great climatic change at the close of the Swedish Bronze Age (ca 700 B. C.) the struggle was against the encroaching spruce on practically all fronts. The struggle resulted in culture steppes, pine heaths, birch groves and <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows.</b> All these types of landscape were gradually filled with the fauna adapted to them. Different types of cultivation have alternated, and as the nature has changed, the fauna has adapted itself. But up to the nineteenth century these changes were not so great that they altered the general picture of the animal world. Imagine Sweden a century and a half ago! Spruce forests dominated then as now, but they were less uniform; they had kept their individuality and character. <b>Wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> were numerous, for the regular leaf harvest that created them was of great importance in the former agrarian economy. In that way the spruce was kept at bay and the <b>wooded</b> <b>meadows</b> could develop freely, and there the farmers could collect leaves for winter fodder. The young Swedish soil was then still virgin. Thousands of lakes, marshes and fens, the inheritage of the great ice-cap, filled the countryside. Through the country ran the glittering silver bands of streams and brooks. In spring they widened and at times the water flooded the meadows. As summer approached, the low-lying alluvial fields of sedge, horsetail and rush were transformed by the sun into natural meadows, which were mown yearly to make use of everything that could serve as fodder for the livestock during the coming winter...|$|E
