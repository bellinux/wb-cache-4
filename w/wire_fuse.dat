25|$|A fuse {{consists}} of a metal strip or <b>wire</b> <b>fuse</b> element, of small cross-section compared to the circuit conductors, mounted between a pair of electrical terminals, and (usually) enclosed by a non-combustible housing. The fuse is arranged in series to carry all the current passing through the protected circuit. The resistance of the element generates heat due to the current flow. The size and construction of the element is (empirically) determined so that the heat produced for a normal current does not cause the element to attain a high temperature. If too high a current flows, the element rises to a higher temperature and either directly melts, or else melts a soldered joint within the fuse, opening the circuit.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} to ribbon was flash powder, {{a mixture of}} magnesium powder and potassium chlorate, introduced by its German inventors Adolf Miethe and Johannes Gaedicke in 1887. A measured amount was put into a pan or trough and ignited by hand, producing a brief brilliant flash of light, along with the smoke and noise that might be expected from such an explosive event. This could be a life-threatening activity, especially if the flash powder was damp. An electrically triggered flash lamp was invented by Joshua Lionel Cowen in 1899. His patent describes a device for igniting photographers’ flash powder by using dry cell batteries to heat a <b>wire</b> <b>fuse.</b> Variations and alternatives were touted {{from time to time}} and a few found a measure of success, especially for amateur use. In 1905, one French photographer was using intense non-explosive flashes produced by a special mechanized carbon arc lamp to photograph subjects in his studio, but more portable and less expensive devices prevailed. On through the 1920s, flash photography normally meant a professional photographer sprinkling powder into the trough of a T-shaped flash lamp, holding it aloft, then triggering a brief and (usually) harmless bit of pyrotechnics.|$|E

Dr. Randy Curry, Thesis SupervisorDissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Electrical engineering. M. S. University of Missouri [...] Columbia 2008. As part of the University Consortium for High Power Microwave (HPM) Integration, compact power conditioning and RF systems were investigated with a maximum diameter of 15. 24 cm. A simulator of a flux compression generator (FCG) was built as a non-destructive test stand to evaluate the power conditioning and RF systems. The FCG simulator approximated the rising current signal of an FCG with a peak between 20 kA and 60 kA. The power conditioning system consisted of a spiral-strip pulse transformer, an exploding <b>wire</b> <b>fuse,</b> and a crowbar switch. The pulse transformer enabled compact inductive energy storage, voltage step-up, and electrical isolation. The exploding <b>wire</b> <b>fuse</b> was implemented as an opening switch to transfer energy to the RF circuit, and extensive modeling of the dynamic fuse resistance was performed. The crowbar switch prevented stray circuit or generator inductance from causing fuse restrike. The RF system utilized a compact high voltage capacitor and low inductance shunt to produce high frequency RF as an alternative to HPM sources. Three geometries of the RF system were investigated with capacitances ranging from 275 pF to 730 pF. A tri-plate system was built as a proof of principle of operation of the RF system with the power conditioning components. Spiral-strip and coaxial-cylinder capacitor geometries were investigated as compact designs. Testing of the power conditioning and RF systems was conducted with the FCG simulator and FCGs. Voltages of 180 kV or more were generated with all three geometries, resulting in greater than 130 MW of peak power. The RF frequency content peaked at 10 s of MHz, and the frequency content of the tri-plate geometry extended to 250 MHz. In experiments with an antenna load, the peak voltage was greater than 700 kV. An electric field of 6 kV/m peak-to-peak was measured 5. 5 m from the RF system, thus achieving the final goal of the consortium...|$|E

40|$|For {{high power}} IC chips, as device size inevitably decreases, the wire {{diameter}} unfortunately must decrease {{due to the}} need of finer pitch <b>wires.</b> <b>Fusing</b> or melting of wirebonds thus increasingly becomes one of the potential failure issues for such IC’s. Experiments were performed under transient loads on dummy packages having aluminum, gold, or copper wires of different dimensions. A finite element model was constructed that correlates very well with the observed maximum operating currents for such wirebonds under actual experimental test conditions. A qualitative observation of typical current profiles, as fusing conditions were approached, was that current would reach a maximum value {{very early in the}} pulse, and then fall gradually. One goal achieved through the modeling was to show that the current in the wire falls with time due to the heating of the wire material. Correspondingly, the wire reaches the melting temperature not at the peak current but rather at the end of pulse. Further, modeling shows that knowledge of external resistance and inductance of the experimental set up are highly significant in determining the details of a fusing event, but if known along with the temperaturedependent wire properties, the simulation can predict the correct voltage and current response of the part with 2 % error. On the other hand, lack of external circuit characteristics may lead to completely incorrect results. For instance, the assumption that current is constant until the <b>wire</b> heats to <b>fusing</b> temperature, or that current and temperature both rise monotonically to maximum values until the <b>wire</b> <b>fuses,</b> are almost certain to be wrong. The work has been carried out for single pulse events as well as pulse trains. Key words: Bond <b>wire</b> <b>fusing,</b> <b>wire</b> melting, <b>fusing</b> current I...|$|R
40|$|The Thesis {{presents}} an in-depth study of arcing behaviour of H. B. C. Fuses {{for a range}} of fuse elements and fillers, under critical current conditions. The methodologies used were the standard breaking capacity short-circuit test plus the application of crow-bar, Xray studies, metallographic microscopic and optical fiber arc detection techniques. Due to the observation of some unknown and puzzling arc phenomena it was decided to pursue the arc investigation by an extensive test programme of single uniform <b>wire</b> <b>fuse</b> elements. From the investigation a basic arc mechanism for the pre-peak and post-peak arcs period was discovered. The new mechanism was applied to single wire, strip, long notched, medium notched and short notched fuse elements and to paralleled wires and strips immersed in three quartz filler types: standard sand, high quality granular quartz and bound quartz in two different sizes. The proposed arc mechanism was modelled by a computer program which was used to simulate the described fuse constructions. The results of over 800 tests and subsequent simulation undoubtedly confirm that the proposed arc mechanism is applicable for the described fuse types. The experimental and analytical results are close enough to justify the model application for fuse designers and fuse users. A critical comparison of the experimental and analytical results with previous findings published by other researchers is presented. A detailed arc mechanism and the key behaviour rules are proposed, they are: " Maximum column voltage can not exceed the arc-root voltage. " The arc-root voltage and the initial dv/dt values are influenced by filler characteristics and are able to precisely characterize the filler behaviour. " The dv/dt, and consequently the burn-back are instantaneous current density functions. The application of the above rules allows the fuse designer to tailor the fuse element in order to obtain specific current and arc voltage waveforms. It is believed that the proposed arc mechanism and computer model is able to explain some puzzling are phenomena and eventually could be applied to predicting other low overload H. B. C. fuse behaviour...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The rewireable fuse or cutout {{is widely}} used in Bangladesh and elsewhere, {{in spite of the}} very real danger of {{improper}} replacement of <b>fuse</b> <b>wires.</b> To assess the problem, a preliminary survey of buildings, electrical shops, and electricians were conducted. The majority of buildings and retail establishments were found to use <b>fuse</b> <b>wires.</b> Electricians were found to use copper of arbitrary thicknesses as fuses, and were unaware of the existence of specialized <b>fuse</b> <b>wires.</b> Every year, there are numerous fires in the garments and other industries, causing hundreds of deaths.
