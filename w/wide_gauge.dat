2500|$|Lionel's {{earliest}} trains were {{larger than}} the sizes commonly available today, running on two-rail tracks with the rails 2inches apart. In 1906, Lionel began offering a three-rail track that simplified wiring of reverse loops and accessories. Its outer rails were 2inches apart, which did not match any of the existing standards that other manufacturers had been using since 1891. Whether this was an accidental misreading of Märklin's 2 gauge specifications or an intentional incompatibility is unclear, but Lionel marketed this non-standard track as [...] "The Standard of the World," [...] and soon adopted the name in its catalogs as Standard Gauge and trademarked the name. When other U.S. companies began using Lionel's standard, they usually called it <b>wide</b> <b>gauge.</b> Starting in 1915, Lionel followed most of its U.S. competitors and adopted the smaller O gauge standard for its budget-level trains.|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{the railway}} {{construction}} {{was done by}} Indian companies supervised by British engineers. The system was heavily built, using a <b>wide</b> <b>gauge,</b> sturdy tracks and strong bridges. By 1900 India had {{a full range of}} rail services with diverse ownership and management, operating on broad, metre and narrow gauge networks. [...] In 1900, the government took over the GIPR network, while the company continued to manage it. During the First World War, the railways were used to transport troops and grains to the ports of Bombay and Karachi en route to Britain, Mesopotamia, and East Africa. With shipments of equipment and parts from Britain curtailed, maintenance became much more difficult; critical workers entered the army; workshops were converted to making artillery; some locomotives and cars were shipped to the Middle East. The railways could barely keep up with the increased demand. [...] By the end of the war, the railways had deteriorated for lack of maintenance and were not profitable. In 1923, both GIPR and EIR were nationalised.|$|E

While Ives was inconsistent in what it called its larger-gauge trains, it most frequently called it <b>wide</b> <b>gauge.</b> Numerous other companies also entered the <b>wide</b> <b>gauge</b> market in the early 1920s, increasing consumer interest in the size and forcing the manufacturers to innovate in order to survive.|$|E

50|$|This is {{an attempt}} to {{overcome}} one of the primary problems with differing gauge systems - gauge incompatibility. However, it means that the narrower gauge network must be built to a structure gauge large enough to accommodate the loading <b>gauge</b> of the <b>wider</b> <b>gauge</b> equipment, negating one of the cost advantages of a narrower gauge construction. Additionally, a large <b>wider</b> <b>gauge</b> wagon balanced on a narrower gauge transporter wagon is not very stable, and is generally restricted to low speeds of 15 mph or so.|$|R

50|$|Generally, sauropod trackways {{are divided}} into three {{categories}} based on the distance between opposite limbs: narrow gauge, medium gauge, and <b>wide</b> <b>gauge.</b> The gauge of the trackway can help determine how wide-set the limbs of various sauropods were and how this may have impacted the way they walked. A 2004 study by Day and colleagues found that a general pattern could be found among groups of advanced sauropods, with each sauropod family being characterised by certain trackway gauges. They found that most sauropods other than titanosaurs had narrow-gauge limbs, with strong impressions of the large thumb claw on the forefeet. Medium gauge trackways with claw impressions on the forefeet probably belong to brachiosaurids and other primitive titanosauriformes, which were evolving wider-set limbs but retained their claws. Primitive true titanosaurs also retained their forefoot claw but had evolved fully <b>wide</b> <b>gauge</b> limbs. <b>Wide</b> <b>gauge</b> limbs were retained by advanced titanosaurs, trackways from which show a <b>wide</b> <b>gauge</b> and lack of any claws or digits on the forefeet.|$|E
