In its midseason report, The Baltimore Sun credited Smith for often giving an inconsistent Maryland team good field position <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>long</b> kick returns.|$|E
5|$|After the Indonesian film {{industry}} crashed in 1992 Umboh directed two television serials: Pahlawan Tak Dikenal (Unknown Hero; 1994) and Apsari. The crash, along <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>long</b> illness, led his finances to destabilise, {{to the point}} where he lived in government housing. In 1994 Suara Pembaharuan (now Suara Pembaruan), inaccurately reported him having died, a claim which Umboh publicly refuted. Umboh died at 4:45am WIB (UTC+7) on 24January 1996 in Jakarta of complications from diabetes and a stroke. He was buried in Jeruk Purut Cemetery, South Jakarta. Three weeks before his death, he was reportedly in good health and preparing to film a new serial entitled Gejolak Kampus Muda (Symptoms of a Youth Campus).|$|E

He {{believes}} himself {{to be one of the}} greatest chessplayers in the world, and thinks that if everything had gone on to his liking he could have beaten all the champions at the tournament. He is a deliberate player, but every now and then he takes a nip from a flask of brandy that generally stands on his table. He complained that his chair was too low, and he once attributed a defeat to that. Finally, he got a large ledger and sat upon it. He did, in fact, seem to derive some inspiration from its contents, for he played two or three excellent games afterward.|$|E

25|$|Netzer was a playmaker and is {{considered}} one of the best midfielders of all time, gaining a lot of attention <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>long</b> passes and pushes from deep within his own half of the pitch. Apart from his superior ball skills, his natural authority made him the undisputed leader of his team. As a player for Borussia Mönchengladbach, he enjoyed a lot of freedom from the management and the coach Hennes Weisweiler, even off the pitch.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{his lack}} of worldly success, Koechlin was {{apparently}} a loved and venerated figure in French music, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>long</b> flowing beard contributing to his patriarchal image. Following his 1888 illness, the need to build up his strength led him to become an enthusiastic mountaineer, swimmer and tennis player. He was also an amateur astronomer and an accomplished photographer. He {{was one of the}} great nature-mystics among French composers, whose personal creed was pantheistic rather than Christian. Though never a member of the Communist Party he subscribed to its ideals, and in the later 1930s especially was much concerned with the idea of 'Music for the People'.|$|E

25|$|After Queen Marie-Thérèse's {{death in}} 1683 and the king's secret {{marriage}} to Mme de Maintenon, devotion {{came to the}} fore at court. The king's enthusiasm for opera dissipated; he was revolted by Lully's dissolute life and homosexual encounters. In 1686, to show his displeasure, Louis XIV made a point of not inviting Lully to perform Armide at Versailles. Lully died from gangrene, having struck his foot <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>long</b> conducting staff during a performance of his Te Deum to celebrate Louis XIV's recovery from surgery. He refused to have his leg amputated so he could still dance. This resulted in gangrene propagating through his body and ultimately infecting the greater part of his brain, causing his death. He died in Paris and was buried in the church of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires, where his tomb with its marble bust can still be seen. All three of his sons (Louis Lully, Jean-Baptiste Lully fils, and Jean-Louis Lully) had musical careers as successive surintendants of the King's Music.|$|E
25|$|However, {{a tougher}} fight awaited against Surrey at The Oval, who had England's Test spin {{combination}} of Jim Laker and Tony Lock. Miller {{came in at}} 3/124 to join Colin McDonald and struggled, scoring 18runs in his first 120minutes; it was the slowest two hours of scoring in his career, featuring much pad play as he attempted to play Laker from the crease, and stretching forward <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>long</b> arms when necessary. Such was Miller's watchfulness that he only scored 21 of 97 runs as Australia lost 6/97 to be 9/217, whereas he was normally an attacking batsman. As his partners continued to fall, Miller accelerated and scored 36 of the 42runs in the last-wicket partnership with Jack Wilson in half an hour. He cut loose in two consecutive overs from Lock, taking 11 and 14 respectively. He ended unbeaten on 57 as Australia were bowled out for 259; Laker taking all ten wickets. Surrey then scored 347. Miller fell to Lock for two in the second innings as Australia collapsed as lost 9/34 for 107. Such was the spin-friendly nature of the surface that Surrey's new ball pairing bowled only three overs before Laker and Lock took over. During the match, the home team's spin pairing bowled more than 65% of the overs, something {{that was to be}} repeated throughout the summer. Surrey then compiled the 20 runs required for victory, inflicting a ten-wicket defeat, Australia's first loss to a county since 1912. Following the loss, sections of the Australian media, led by Jack Fingleton, began campaigning for Miller to replace Johnson as captain.|$|E

500|$|Miles is characterised {{as being}} charming and quick witted. His clothes often consist of board shorts and {{crumpled}} shirts, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>long</b> hair, this {{gives him a}} trademark [...] "beachy" [...] look. Miles' style changed in 2010 following Quong Tart's break from the show. Upon returning to Home and Away, the actor had lost weight, grown a beard and cut his hair short. Producers were impressed with the changes and wrote them into the scripts. Miles is often seen consuming large amounts of food, which stems from his time spent living hungry on the streets. This was a character trait created by Quong Tart. Some viewers have written to Home and Away to complain about Miles' eating habits.|$|E
500|$|Further {{evidence}} for a 14-16 hand (...) war horse {{is that it was}} a matter of pride to a knight to be able to vault onto his horse in full armour, without touching the stirrup. This arose not from vanity, but necessity: if unhorsed during battle, a knight would remain vulnerable if unable to mount by himself. [...] In reality, of course, a wounded or weary knight might find it difficult, and rely on a vigilant squire to assist him. [...] Incidentally, a knight's armour served in his favour in any fall. <b>With</b> <b>his</b> <b>long</b> hair twisted on his head to form a springy padding under his padded-linen hood, and his helm placed on top, he had head protection not dissimilar to a modern bicycle or equestrian helmet.|$|E

500|$|Leno also {{appeared}} in burlesque and, every year from 1888 to 1904, in the Drury Lane Theatre's Christmas pantomime spectacles. [...] He was generous and active in charitable causes, especially to benefit performers in need. [...] Leno continued to appear in musical comedies and his own music hall routines until 1902, although he suffered increasingly from alcoholism. This, together <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>long</b> association with dame and low comedy roles, prevented him from being taken seriously as a dramatic actor, and he was turned down for Shakespearean roles. Leno began to behave in an erratic and furious manner by 1902, and he suffered a mental breakdown in early 1903. He was committed to a mental asylum, but was discharged later that year. After one more show, his health declined, and he died aged 43.|$|E

500|$|Reeves {{provided}} a story outline which met with Tenser's enthusiastic approval. Tenser immediately began {{putting together a}} preliminary budget, and requested that Reeves quickly complete a full film script, stressing to Reeves that the production would need to commence by September of that year to avoid shooting during cold weather. Reeves called in his childhood friend Tom Baker (who had co-written The Sorcerers with Reeves) to assist him with the script. Reeves and Baker began drafting a screenplay with Donald Pleasence firmly in mind as the film's star. However, once American International Pictures {{became involved in the}} production, they insisted that their contract star, Vincent Price, be given the lead, and Pleasence was dropped from the film. With the abrupt change of star, Reeves and Baker had to rethink their original concept of presenting Hopkins as [...] "ineffective and inadequate... a ridiculous authority figure", which they had believed Pleasence could play to perfection. They knew the tall, imposing Price, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>long</b> history of horror roles, would have {{to be more of a}} straightforward villain, and they made changes to their script accordingly.|$|E
