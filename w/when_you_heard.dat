Hutchins said, [...] "They weren't in any key and had no rhythm whatsoever. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> it, {{you just had to}} say 'Ouch!'" [...] Hutchins played the sound effects for series creator Hillenburg for review. [...] Hillenburg rejected it, saying [...] "it was too far over the edge." [...] Hutchins said, [...] "a lot of effort for something that lasts only 15 seconds on screen. In this case, the whole thing never made it on the air." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Kennedy {{sat down}} for an {{interview}} with entertainer Jack Paar. The senator was in a grave mood; when asked how he thought the White House might accommodate a family as large as his, he responded, [...] "Do you think {{that is going to be}} my biggest problem?" [...] When Paar more seriously asked if jobs would solve the problems of urban ghettos, Kennedy replied that while job opportunity was important, it needed to be accompanied by [...] "compassion for one's fellow human beings." [...] Paar then asked, [...] "What did you think <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> that Dr. King had been assassinated?" [...] Kennedy answered, [...] "That more and more people are turning to violence. And in the last analysis it's going to destroy our country." ...|$|E
2500|$|The event left {{a lasting}} {{impression}} on many worldwide. As with the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor before it and the September 11 attacks after it, asking [...] "Where were you <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> about President Kennedy's assassination" [...] would become a common topic of discussion.|$|E

But you ought to have regarded an order from the Apostolic See as not less weighty than one from the emperor. ...The government of souls, which belongs to bishops, is more important than the imperial, which is only concerned with the temporal. Your assertion that I have only come to blindly excommunicate is shameless, and your offer to give me an honourable reception if I should have come exactly in the way the emperor wanted me to is contemptuous. With regards to the oaths I have taken to the emperor, I will avoid perjury by pointing out to the emperor what he has done against the unity and peace of the Church and his kingdom. With regards to the bishops, in opposing my efforts in behalf of peace, what they threaten has not been done, from the beginning of the Church.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Denouncing the UDA, {{the trial}} judge, Mr. Justice McGonigle stated, [...] "What appears before me today {{under the name}} of the UDA is gun law, a vicious, brutalising {{organisation}} of persons who take the law into their own hands and who, by kangaroo courts and the infliction of physical brutality, terrorise a neighbourhood through intimidation". During the trial, it emerged that plans to kill Ogilby had been formulated by the UDA unit several months before her kangaroo court [...] "trial". Douglas was lambasted by Justice McGonigle, [...] "You ordered and directed the punishment of this girl. You chose and chose well those who were to carry out your directions. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> what had happened you organised the cover-up and disposal of the body. Your concern was that these happenings should not come to light. You were the commander of these women; your responsibility was great. You are no stranger to crime. You have a record of smuggling, forgery, assault and actual bodily harm and aiding and abetting the keeping of a brothel. Though the last of these was in 1961 it is an indication of your character." [...] The Northern Irish press dubbed Elizabeth Douglas [...] "the Sandy Row executioner".|$|E
2500|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, he was {{involved}} in shows for the BBC and Thames Television (as well as Frankie Howerd Reveals All for Yorkshire Television in 1980). Ray Galton and Alan Simpson wrote for him from 1964 to 1966 when he worked for the BBC and also for a one-off show for Thames, Frankie Howerd meets the Bee Gees, shown on 20 August 1968. He was famous for his seemingly off-the-cuff remarks to the audience, especially in the show Up Pompeii!, which was a direct follow-up from Forum. His television work was characterised by direct addresses to camera and by his littering monologues with verbal tics such as [...] "Oooh, no missus" [...] and [...] "Titter ye not". A later sale of his scripts, however, showed that the seemingly off-the-cuff remarks had all been meticulously planned. Barry Cryer said of his technique: [...] "What he could do with a script was amazing, like all the great performers. He transformed something you'd just written – what you hoped was in a Frankie Howerd idiom – but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> him do it, my God, it was something else; – it was gossiping over the garden wall, the apparent waffle – he was like a tightrope walker, you thought he's going to fall off in a minute, you thought , 'Come on, Frank' , we're waiting for a laugh, and then, suddenly, Bang. He {{knew exactly what he was}} doing." [...] Another feature of his humour was to feign innocence about his obvious and [...] double entendres, while mockingly censuring the audience for finding them funny.|$|E

2500|$|Tatum drew {{inspiration}} from the pianists James P. Johnson and Fats Waller, who exemplified the stride piano style, and from the more [...] "modern" [...] Earl Hines, six years Tatum's senior. [...] Tatum identified Waller as his main influence, but according to pianist Teddy Wilson and saxophonist Eddie Barefield, [...] "Art Tatum's favorite jazz piano player was Earl Hines. He used to buy all of Earl's records and would improvise on them. He'd play the record but he'd improvise over what Earl was doing ... 'course, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>heard</b> Art play you didn't hear nothing of anybody but Art. But he got his ideas from Earl's style of playing – but Earl never knew that." [...] A major event in his meteoric rise to success was his appearance at a cutting contest in 1933 at Morgan's bar in New York City that included Waller, Johnson and Willie [...] "The Lion" [...] Smith. [...] Standard contest pieces included Johnson's [...] "Harlem Strut" [...] and [...] "Carolina Shout", and Waller's [...] "Handful of Keys". Tatum performed his arrangements of [...] "Tea for Two" [...] and [...] "Tiger Rag", in a performance that {{was considered to be}} the last word in stride piano. [...] Johnson, reminiscing about Tatum's debut afterward, simply said, [...] "When Tatum played Tea For Two that night I guess {{that was the first time}} I ever heard it really played." [...] Tatum's debut was historic because he outplayed the elite competition and heralded the demise of the stride era. [...] He was not challenged further until stride specialist Donald Lambert initiated a half-serious rivalry with him.|$|E

As of this writing many Americans over the age of 15 most likely find these questions remarkably easy to answer. The fact that a singular event in history could be remembered so well, and by so many people, is relevant to at least two lines of research in the memory literature. First, the very fact that people can answer such questions so easily is relevant to research and theory on “flashbulb memories...|$|R
