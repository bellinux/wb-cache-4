With most of the primary systems off-line, Ensign Mayweather notices another ship nearby but no life-signs are detected. Captain Archer leads Lieutenant Reed and several MACOs on an away mission, and discover the crew are all dead. Taking <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>can,</b> they return and resume their mission.|$|E
5|$|Other {{issues in}} {{philosophy}} of psychology are philosophical {{questions about the}} nature of mind, brain, and cognition, and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of cognitive science, or philosophy of mind. For example, are humans rational creatures? Is there any sense in which they have free will, and how does that relate to the experience of making choices? Philosophy of psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in cognitive neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, and artificial intelligence, questioning <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> and cannot explain in psychology.|$|E

5|$|At {{one year}} of age, joint {{attention}} is displayed through a child's understanding of pointing as an intentional act. One-year-olds also establish joint attention for objects within their visual field before objects beyond their current visual field. At this age, infants are not yet able to represent their entire environment, only <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> see. At age 15 months, children recognize the minds of others. At this age, children also {{recognize the importance of}} eyes for seeing and that physical objects can block sight. At age 18 months, infants are capable of following an individual's gaze to outside their visual field and establishing (representative) joint attention. 18-month-olds also grasp the intentional, referential nature of looking, the mentalistic experience of seeing and the role of eyes and are skilled at following both gaze and pointing with precision. At two years of age, children display joint attention by extending attention beyond the present and understanding that the targets of other's attention extends to the past as well. Two-year-olds are also capable of representational thought or increased memory.|$|E

25|$|An {{individual}} {{must be able}} {{to connect}} in order to achieve enhancement of social and cultural capital and achieve mass economic gains in productivity. Even though individuals in the United States are legally capable of accessing the Internet, many are thwarted by barriers to entry such as a lack of means to infrastructure or the inability to comprehend the information that the Internet provides. Lack of infrastructure and lack of knowledge are two major obstacles that impede mass connectivity. These barriers limit individuals' capabilities in <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> do and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> achieve in accessing technology. Some individuals have the ability to connect, but have nonfunctioning capabilities in {{that they do not have}} the knowledge to use what information ICTs and Internet technologies provide them.|$|E

25|$|The {{bone loss}} also {{results in a}} {{significant}} decrease in chewing force, prompting many denture and partial wearers to avoid certain kinds of food. Food collecting under the appliance takes their enjoyment out of eating so they make their grocery and restaurant choices by <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> eat.

25|$|How {{individuals}} {{view themselves}} ultimately determines who they are, their abilities and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be. Having both too low of self-esteem {{as well as}} too high of one can be detrimental to an individual's mental health. A person's self-esteem plays a much larger role in their overall happiness and quality of life.

25|$|Honey of four bee {{species is}} eaten by {{chimpanzees}}. Groups of chimpanzees fish with sticks for the honey after having tried to remove <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> {{with their hands}}. They usually extract with their hands honeycombs from undisturbed hives of honey bees and run away from the bees to quietly eat their catch. In contrast, hives {{that have already been}} disturbed, either through the falling of the tree or because of the intervention of other predators, are cleaned of the remaining honey with fishing tools.|$|E
25|$|The aborigines’ diet {{very much}} depends on nature. With profuse {{vegetation}} and wild animals, the aborigines were natural hunter-gatherers. Essentially, much of what Aborigines ate depended on their environment – that is, whether they lived in coastal or mountainous areas. Tribes like Amis, Atayal, Saisiyat and Bunun hunt <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>can,</b> and gather what they cultivate. On the other hand, tribes like the Yamis and the Thao have fish as a predominant source of food. Majority of foods consisted of millet, taro, sweet potato, wild greens and game like boar and rat. This {{is in contrast to}} the main foods eaten by the Han, which consisted of rice and chicken.|$|E

25|$|The trio then confronts Paradox, who {{reveals that}} {{he comes from}} a future beyond Yusei's in which the world lies in ruins, and claims {{that the only way to}} fix it is to {{eliminate}} Duel Monsters from history. However, the three heroes protest that by doing so all the future events and people will be erased as well, and challenge him to a duel. By combining the powers of their key monsters, Yugi, Jaden and Yusei defeat Paradox, who disappears. After the duel, Yusei, Jaden and Yugi say that they will do <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> to make sure the future is not like Paradox's, and say goodbye and the latter two return to their respective time periods. New Domino City returns to normal, and Yusei finally can let go of the past and focus on the future.|$|E
