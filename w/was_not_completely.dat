5|$|An African prefecture, {{centered}} in Carthage, {{was established in}} April 534, but it would teeter {{on the brink of}} collapse during the next 15 years, amidst warfare with the Moors and military mutinies. The area <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>completely</b> pacified until 548, but remained peaceful thereafter and enjoyed a measure of prosperity. The recovery of Africa cost the empire about 100,000 pounds of gold.|$|E
5|$|Excavations for {{construction}} of the building's foundations started in October 1961 and the first concrete pour occurred in November 1961. The building <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>completely</b> finished by the time Perth hosted the Commonwealth Games in November 1962, however the builders rushed to finish the ground, eighth, and 10th floors in time so that foreign dignitaries could be entertained in the reception areas.|$|E
5|$|Following Rider and Hewecker, {{certificates}} of division {{continued to be}} issued in civil cases. Felsenheld v. United States (1902) was the last civil certificate of division case. The possibility of civil {{certificates of}} division <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>completely</b> abolished until the Judicial Code of 1911 abolished the circuit courts.|$|E

5|$|Massachusetts {{has avoided}} {{many forms of}} racial strife seen {{elsewhere}} in the US, but examples such as the successful electoral showings of the nativist (mainly anti-Catholic) Know Nothings in the 1850s, the controversial Sacco and Vanzetti executions in the 1920s, and Boston's opposition to desegregation busing in the 1970s show that the ethnic history of Massachusetts <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>completely</b> harmonious.|$|E
5|$|The An Lushan Rebellion {{began in}} December 755, and <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>completely</b> {{suppressed}} for almost eight years. It caused enormous disruption to Chinese society: the census of 754 recorded 52.9 million people, but ten years later, the census counted just 16.9 million, the remainder having been displaced or killed.|$|E
5|$|The palace was {{the first}} and most {{important}} structure to be erected at the new capital of Heian-kyō, where the court moved in 794 following Emperor Kanmu's order.

5|$|Yorcks {{commanding}} officer, Captain Piper, {{was among}} those rescued. In December 1914 he was court-martialled and sentenced to two years' imprisonment for negligence, disobedience of orders, and homicide through negligence. The ship's wreck was partially scrapped in 1929–30; more work was done in 1965, though the ship <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>completely</b> removed until work resumed in 1982.|$|E
5|$|After {{a lengthy}} refit in Canada from October 1944 to February 1945, Kootenay {{returned}} to the UK and {{was assigned to the}} Western Approaches Command {{until the end of the}} war. She then transported returning troops in Canada until paid off in October. She was sold for scrap in 1946. Duncan was paid off in May and sold in July although she <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>completely</b> broken up until 1949.|$|E
5|$|Although {{she had not}} {{suffered}} {{anything like}} the damage she had inflicted, Virginia <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>completely</b> unscathed. Shots from Cumberland, Congress, and Union troops ashore had riddled her smokestack, reducing her already low speed. Two of her guns were disabled and several armor plates had been loosened. Two of her crew were killed, and more were wounded. One of the wounded was Captain Buchanan, whose left thigh was pierced by a rifle shot.|$|E

5|$|By the 17th century, Angkor Wat <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>completely</b> {{abandoned}} and {{functioned as a}} Buddhist temple. Fourteen inscriptions dated from the 17th century discovered in Angkor area testify to Japanese Buddhist pilgrims that had established small settlements alongside Khmer locals. At that time, the temple was thought by the Japanese visitors as the famed Jetavana garden of the Buddha, which originally located {{in the kingdom of}} Magadha, India. The best-known inscription tells of Ukondafu Kazufusa, who celebrated the Khmer New Year at Angkor Wat in 1632.|$|E
5|$|Law enforcement's corrupt {{attitude}} generally {{was not at}} {{the expense}} of the people. Apart from the economic benefits provided by the Maceos, these bosses provided a high degree of protection to the island's citizens. When serious crimes were committed the local police would sometimes contact the Maceos to have the matter dealt with. However, the island <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>completely</b> peaceful; threats at the point of a gun were a common means for the Maceo gang to ensure control. Though the average citizen was relatively safe, gangland slayings of potential rivals did take place on occasion.|$|E
5|$|The 75-minute film premiered at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival {{before its}} {{television}} premiere on Animal Planet on May 25, 2008. While it was praised for its cinematography, {{for maintaining the}} depth of coverage of the television series, and for its accessibility to newcomers to the series, it was criticized for not offering anything new to fans. The Kalahari Meerkat Project noted that the film <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>completely</b> accurate but praised it overall and recommended against analyzing it. Several reviewers praised Goldberg's narration, but the script was criticized as being too simplistic for adult viewers.|$|E

5|$|The concept, which {{originated}} in castles such as Krak des Chevaliers, was {{to remove the}} reliance on a central strongpoint and to emphasise the defence of the curtain walls. There would be multiple rings of defensive walls, one inside the other, with the inner ring rising above the outer so that its field of fire <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>completely</b> obscured. If assailants made it past {{the first line of}} defence they would be caught in the killing ground between the inner and outer walls and have to assault the second wall.|$|E
5|$|The object element: The eyes also {{test support}} of the HTML object element. The object element {{has been a part}} of HTML since HTML 4 was {{released}} in 1998, yet by 2005 it still <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>completely</b> supported in all web browsers. The creators of Acid2 considered object element support important because it allows for content fallback—if an object fails to load, then the browser can display alternative (generally simpler, more reliable) content in its place.|$|E
5|$|Acid2 {{was first}} {{proposed}} by Håkon Wium Lie, {{chief technical officer}} of Opera Software and creator of the widely used Cascading Style Sheets web standard. In a 16 March 2005 article on CNET, Lie expressed dismay that Microsoft Internet Explorer did not properly support web standards and hence <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>completely</b> interoperable with other browsers. He announced that Acid2 would be a challenge to Microsoft to design Internet Explorer 7, then in development, to achieve {{a greater degree of}} standards compliance than previous versions of Internet Explorer. The original Acid1 test had forced browser makers to fix their applications or face embarrassment; Lie hoped that Acid2 would do the same.|$|E

5|$|After Christmas 1914, {{sporadic}} {{attempts were}} made at seasonal truces; a German unit attempted to leave their trenches under a flag of truce on Easter Sunday 1915, but were warned off by the British opposite them, {{and later in the}} year, in November, a Saxon unit briefly fraternised with a Liverpool battalion. In December 1915, there were explicit orders by the Allied commanders to forestall any repeat of the previous Christmas truce. Individual units were encouraged to mount raids and harass the enemy line, whilst communicating with the enemy was discouraged by artillery barrages along the front line throughout the day. The prohibition <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>completely</b> effective, however, and a small number of brief truces occurred.|$|E
5|$|After his forced retirement, Peng lived alone, under {{constant}} surveillance from the Central Guard Unit of the PLA, {{accompanied by a}} secretary and a bodyguard. His wife remained in Beijing; and, due to her work as the Party secretary of Beijing Normal University, was only able to visit infrequently. Peng's guards prevented curious local farmers from visiting Peng, until Peng threatened to complain to Mao. Peng's niece, Peng Meikui, visited frequently, and the two became close. Peng {{spent most of his}} free time renovating his home, gardening, and studying Marxist theory, agriculture, and economics. Peng <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>completely</b> purged: even though he could not participate in government meetings or decision-making bodies, he still received and read all documents distributed {{to the members of the}} Politburo and State Council, which he was technically still a member of. In 1960 Peng attended the funeral of Lin Boqu.|$|E
5|$|Dollo's {{specimens}} {{allowed him}} to show that Owen's prehistoric pachyderms were not correct for Iguanodon. He instead modelled the skeletal mounts after the cassowary and wallaby, and put the spike {{that had been on}} the nose firmly on the thumb. He <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>completely</b> correct, but he also had the disadvantage of being faced with some of the first complete dinosaur remains. A problem that was later recognised was the bend he introduced into the tail. This organ was more or less straight, as shown by the skeletons he was excavating, and the presence of ossified tendons. In fact, to get the bend in the tail for a more wallaby or kangaroo-like posture, the tail would have had to be broken. With its correct, straight tail and back, the animal would have walked with its body held horizontal to the ground, arms in place to support the body if needed.|$|E
