5000|$|A {{numbered}} {{limited edition}} run of 10,000 of this box set was also released. The packaging was an electroplated galvanized steel box, enclosed {{in a black}} nylon mesh that was tied off at each end by heavy gauge metal wire. A card that had information about the release, including the limited edition numbering, {{was attached to the}} packaging via a <b>wire</b> <b>tie.</b> The top lid was stamped with the [...] "Black Box" [...] logo. Inside the packaging were the following items (stacked from top to bottom in this order): a single sided poster, the information booklet (the same that was included in the regular release), Disc 1, a coaster with the [...] "Black Box" [...] logo on it, Disc 2, a [...] "Black Box" [...] patch, Disc 3, and a postcard you could mail in for a free catalogue from Wax Trax! / TVT.

40|$|The {{amount of}} H{sub 2 } {{diffusion}} through twist and tape (horse-tail), <b>wire</b> <b>tie,</b> plastic tie, and heat sealed closures on transuranic (TRU) waste bag-out bags has been determined. H{sub 2 } diffusion through wire and plastic tie closures on TRU waste bag-out bags {{has not been}} previously characterized and, as such, TRU waste drums containing bags with these closures cannot be certified and/or shipped to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). Since wire ties have been used at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) from 1980 to 1991 and the plastic ties from 1991 to the present, there are currently thousands of waste drums that cannot be shipped to the WIPP site. Repackaging the waste would be prohibitively expensive. Diffusion experiments performed on the above mentioned closures show that the diffusion rates of plastic tie and horse-tail closures are greater than the accepted value presented in the TRU-PACT 11 Safety Analysis Report (SAR). Diffusion rates for <b>wire</b> <b>tie</b> closures are not statistically different from the SAR value. Thus, drums containing bags with these closures can now potentially be certified which would allow for their consequent shipment to WIPP...|$|E

The methods applied in this experiment consist of using <b>tie</b> <b>wires</b> made from an insulation sheath of low voltage cable, the sheath of PIC itself; composite <b>tie</b> <b>wire</b> and aluminium <b>tie</b> <b>wire</b> (reverse loop binding).

40|$|Abstract—Pollinator {{exclusion}} {{bags for}} small herbaceous plants {{are much more}} convenient to apply and remove if their bottom edge {{is made in the}} form of a cloth tunnel loaded with sand to conform to the terrain. Damage and inadvertent selfing of flowers are minimized. Many experiments in pollination ecology require that pollinators be excluded from flowers. “Pollination bags ” are usually used for this: an open-ended bag of fabric is slid over a shoot and closed by pulling a drawstring or gathering the fabric and using something like a <b>wire</b> <b>tie</b> to keep it snug around the stem. Kearns & Inouye (1993, pp. 13 - 19) discuss this method and some of its problems. There is an acknowledged trade-off involving the mesh size of the fabric: more open weaves may not exclude small visitors such as thrips, but less permeable fabrics tend to cause overheating or condensation. Nevertheless, this technique is widely used. Our lab has adopted polyolefin soil sample bags (Hubco, Inc. ...|$|E

In one particular power supply, all tie wrap holders in use failed and separated from the enclosure. The power supplies are used in Foxboro SPEC- 200 cabinetry that are used throughout the industry.

40|$|The {{strength}} and durability of reinforced, hollow-fill concrete block work is mandated by design codes, which are interpreted by designers and implemented {{on the site}} by the trades. The eventual performance of the block work is dependent upon an appropriate combination of specification, and on-site execution and quality control, and any inadequacy in these steps will result in suboptimal performance, be {{it in terms of}} wall strength or longevity. The accuracy with which reinforcements bars are located both in relation to each other, and to the faces of the wall is a major determinant in this regard. Traditionally, reinforced block work is specified using conventional <b>wire</b> <b>tying</b> wherever continuity or proximity is required. A new product called Blockaid has been developed to replace <b>wire</b> <b>tying.</b> The author was commissioned to determine the effect that the use of Blockaid would have upon both the speed of erection and quality control during construction of a reinforced concrete block retaining wall. The research revealed that the use of Blockaid resulted in a completed wall structure that met the requirements of AS 3700 - 2001 Masonry Structures in terms of achieving correct reinforcement positioning, consistently achieving greater accuracy than conventional best practices. Moreover it achieved a construction speed comparable with commonly encountered, low quality practices, and resulted in construction times 20 % faster than best practice, <b>wire</b> <b>tied</b> techniques...|$|R

5000|$|The first glass {{insulators}} used {{in large}} quantities had an unthreaded pinhole. These pieces of glass were positioned on a tapered wooden pin, vertically extending upwards from the pole's crossarm (commonly only two insulators to a pole and maybe {{one on top of}} the pole itself).

5000|$|Not all {{stationary}} <b>wire</b> <b>tying</b> balers used 2 wires. It was {{not uncommon}} for the larger bale size (usually 17" [...] x 22") machines to use 'boards' that had three slots for <b>wires</b> and hence <b>tied</b> three <b>wires</b> per bale. Most North American manufacturers produced these machines as either regular models or as size options. 'Small square' three <b>wire</b> <b>tying</b> pick-up balers were available from the early 1930s, principally from J. I. Case & Co. and Ann Arbor. These machines were hand tying and hand threading machines. Although New Holland credits itself with inventing the 'successful small square twine tying baler', it produced such machines {{for the first time}} in 1940 after acquiring Ed Nolte and his baler. This baler baled successfully from 1937 onwards. Certainly the quality of the New Holland machines, popularised twine tying hay balers. In Europe, in as early as 1939, both Claas of Germany and Rousseau SA of France had automatic twine tying pick-up balers. Most of these produced low density bales though. The first successful pick-up balers were made by the Ann Arbor Company in 1929. Ann Arbor were acquired by the Oliver Farm Equipment Company in 1943. Despite their head start on the rest of the field, no Ann Arbor balers carried automatic knotters or twisters. Oliver introduced these in 1949.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—To enhance {{installation}} security, a LNG {{storage in}} Rudong of Jiangsu province was adopted {{as a practical}} work, and it was analyzed by nonlinear finite element method to research overall and local stability performance, {{as well as the}} stress and deformation under the action of wind load and self-weight. Results indicate that deformation is tiny when steel mesh maintains as an overall ring, and stress caused by vertical bending moment and tension of bottom <b>tie</b> <b>wire</b> are also in the safe range. However, axial forces of lap reinforcement in adjacent steel mesh exceed the ultimate bearing capacity of <b>tie</b> <b>wire.</b> Hence, <b>tie</b> <b>wires</b> are ruptured; single mesh loses lateral connection and turns into monolithic status as the destruction of overall structure. Further more, monolithic steel mesh is led to collapse by the damage of bottom connection. So, in order to prevent connection failure and enhance installation security, the overlapping parts of steel mesh should be taken more reliable measures.

Also incorporated into the design of the tie is means of preventing water transfer from the outer to the inner leaves. In flat ties this can be a twist. In <b>wire</b> <b>ties</b> this can be corrugations formed in the wire or again a twist.|$|R
