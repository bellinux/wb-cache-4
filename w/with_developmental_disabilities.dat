5|$|In {{individuals}} <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disabilities,</b> {{occurrence of}} self-harm is often demonstrated {{to be related}} to its effects on the environment, such as obtaining attention or desired materials or escaping demands. As developmentally disabled individuals often have communication or social deficits, self-harm may be their way of obtaining these things which they are otherwise unable to obtain in a socially appropriate way (such as by asking). One approach for treating self-harm thus is to teach an alternative, appropriate response which obtains the same result as the self-harm.|$|E
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s the {{movement}} to have education for all was launched at the World Conference that involved various international organizations such as UNESCO, UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF and the World Bank. The main agenda for this conference was Education for All in the entire world. In Tanzania the aspect of education for all is not effectively implemented despite of having policies and legal framework that advocate education for all. The education should enhance teachers who teach children <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disability</b> and also create awareness in the society to accept children with special educational needs. However, children <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disability</b> need extra attention in terms of curriculum adaptation, teaching methods, and availability {{of teaching and learning}} materials, assistive technology, assessment systems, as well as resources and funds for more assistance in adapting the school environment. This study addressed the issue of children <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disability</b> by examining the challenges faced by teachers who teach children <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disability</b> and how they try to overcome these challenges. Local teachers in most of the primary schools in Tanzania lack training in special needs education for children <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disability.</b> Despite the Primary Education Development Plan (PEDP), that ensure education for all, the overall quality of primary education in Tanzania remains generally poor for children <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disability.</b> The shortages of teachers trained on special- educational needs-professionals, as well as the lack of teaching facilities, {{have a negative effect on}} the delivery of quality education to children <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disability.</b> In many schools, class sizes are too big for teachers to facilitate quality learning. The general purpose of this study is to find out what challenges teachers face when teaching children <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disability.</b> Very few studies on children <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disability</b> have been conducted in Tanzania. Most of these few studies focused on secondary school level. Therefore there is a need to conduct such studies at the primary school level. The empirical investigation is guided by the following objectives: 1. To see Teachers understanding of <b>developmental</b> <b>disability.</b> 2. To find out the approach and methods of teaching used by teachers when teaching children <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disability.</b> 3. To see if there are common activities between a unit for children with special educational needs and ordinary classes. 4. To find out to what extent the parents of children <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disability</b> collaborate <b>with</b> special needs education teachers. The main research question for this master thesis is: What challenges do teachers face when teaching children <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disability</b> and how do they overcome them? The study has interviewed and observed four special needs education teachers who teach in two primary schools with a unit for children with special education needs. The study covered three classes. Two parents were interviewed. The study revealed challenges that are quite universal for teaching learners <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disability.</b> Teachers in this study expressed the need for reduced class sizes, modern teaching materials, motivations to teachers, and additional support services from the government. Most teachers teaching children <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disability</b> did not receive any special needs education training from the university, they feel that they are not qualified to teach the children <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disability.</b> This study revealed that the classrooms for children <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disability</b> in Tanzania at large have poor learning environment to support the learners <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disability.</b> The study reveals that collaboration between special needs education teachers and parents for children <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disability</b> is necessary for the wellbeing of their children. Although the results of this study focused on Tanzania, the suggestions may be useful for other developing countries. In order to improve the poor learning environment for special needs educational for children <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disability,</b> the following aspects are recommended. Specialized training facilities Resources; both human and materials Special needs education teachers Future research in this area should involve systematic, long-term development work across a range of sites and settings, which also allows for the examination of the impact of the innovations upon achievement. Such research is necessary if we are to advance knowledge about teaching and learning to understand how combinations of teaching approac...|$|R

5|$|Kazamatsuri is {{the setting}} for a secret war being waged by two main groups: Gaia and Guardian. Gaia, an {{organization}} {{under the auspices of}} the environmental conservation group Martel, is populated by nihilistic and misanthropic people able to contract with familiars, which manifest as constructs fueled by the summoner's life force. Martel itself used to be a church and contains within it a holy maiden group of girls <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Guardian is dedicated to the destruction of familiars and is composed almost entirely of humans who possess special powers. Gaia and Guardian came to Kazamatsuri in the pursuit of the Earth's familiar named Kagari, who manifests as a young, high school age-looking girl. Kagari, the main heroine of Rewrite, has the power to initiate a period of re-evolution, which restarts the process of evolving another means of intelligent life. However, this is done with the use of the Earth's energy, and by the time the events of Rewrite occur, there is no more energy left to do another re-evolution. Gaia wants to capture Kagari to ensure the destruction of humanity, but Guardian wishes to seek out Kagari to kill her, ensuring that human life continues.|$|E

40|$|Our aim in this {{narrative}} inquiry was {{to understand the}} roles of paid carers supporting adults <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disability</b> and complex communication needs in hospital, from the perspectives of 15 paid carers, 15 adults <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disability,</b> and 15 hospital nurses. Results demonstrated that paid carers have an important role in supporting the adult with disability, providing information, delivering basic care, and facilitating communication. Stories reflected paid carer volunteerism; lack of orientation of carers and hospital staff to the paid carers’ roles; blurred role boundaries between paid carers, family carers, and nurses; and paid carers being uncertain about their own responsibilities for staff and patient safety. New policies and practice guidelines are needed to guide both health and disability services in clarifying paid carer roles and role boundaries, and to enable paid carers and hospital staff to work together effectively on the ward in the care of adults <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disability...</b>|$|R

25|$|There {{are many}} {{physical}} health factors associated <b>with</b> <b>developmental</b> <b>disabilities.</b> For some specific syndromes and diagnoses, these are inherent, such as poor heart function {{in people with}} Down syndrome.
