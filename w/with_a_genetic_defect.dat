50|$|It is of {{note that}} kidney {{dysfunction}} {{in general is}} associated with hypercarotenemia {{as a result of}} decreased excretion of carotenoids. Liver dysfunction, regardless of origin, causes hypercarotenemia {{as a result of the}} impaired conversion of carotenoids to retinol. This is of particular interest because jaundice and carotenoderma can coexist in the same patient. Anorexia nervosa causes carotenoderma mainly through diets that are rich in carotenoids and the associated hypothyroidism. It tends to be more common in the restricting subtype of this disease, and is associated with numerous other dermatologic manifestations, such as brittle hair and nails, lanugo-like body hair, and xerosis. Although Alzheimer's disease has been associated with carotenoderma in some reports, most studies on serum carotenoids in these patients show that their levels of carotenoids and retinol are depressed, and may be associated with the development of dementia. A true association between Alzheimer's disease and carotenoderma is unclear at this time. There have been case reports in the literature of increased serum carotenoids and carotenoderma that is unresponsive to dietary measures, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>defect</b> in carotenoid metabolic enzymes proposed. Canthaxanthin and astaxanthin are naturally occurring carotenoids that are used in the British and US food industry to add color to foods such as sausage and fish. Canthaxanthin has been used in over-the-counter “tanning pills” in the United States and Europe, but is not currently Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for this purpose in the United States because of its adverse effects. These include hepatitis, urticaria, aplastic anemia, and a retinopathy characterized by yellow deposits and subsequent visual field defects.|$|E

Roughly 30 staff members were needed in 2008 to produce the show. In 2010, the veterinarian on site said filming was spread over three days, while in 2015 filming occurred in 12-hour blocks over two days. Puppies are given a rest period every 30 minutes, due to {{the heat from the}} lights. Forty-six puppies were used in 2008, and about 60 puppies in 2010. The 2011 production occurred in the New York City area in the fall of 2010, using 47 puppies, while the 2012 show featured 58 puppies. The 2013 show (filmed at a television studio in west midtown in Manhattan) featured 63 puppies, with 10 on the [...] "field" [...] at one time. Filming occurred over two days. The 2014 episode was filmed October 2 to 4, 2013, at the Chelsea Broadcast Center in Manhattan, New York City. A staff of 49 Animal Planet employees and 48 volunteers wrangled the animals, with each puppy assigned a single human overseer. Kittens and cats were filmed the first day, puppies and dogs the second, and other animals on the fourth. A total of 66 puppies were used for the show in 2014, including a basset hound <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>defect</b> to its paw. This allowed 12 to 15 puppies to be on the field at a time, and for puppies to be given rest periods every 20 minutes. Another 30 untrained kittens, five penguins, three trained adult cats, eight [...] "tailgate party" [...] dogs, four police dogs, and six hamsters were used in the 2014 show. All the animals except the penguins (which were provided by the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium) are adoptable. In 2015, 37 shelters from around the United States and Puerto Rico submitted 85 puppies for the event, of which 55 puppies were chosen to be on the air. Another 25 kittens were used for the half-time show. Forty-four shelters and rescue groups in 25 states provided 49 animals in 2016. (Eighty-eight animals [...] "auditioned".) Filming returned to an eight-hour-a-day, three-day format in 2016, with two days used for filming puppies and one day for kittens and other animals. Sixty personnel were needed for filming. Puppies were grouped by size (small, medium, and large) for on-field play.

All-trans retinoic acid (RA) plays crucial roles in embryogenesis.

Embryonic tissues expressing Cyp 26 a 1 show reduced efficiency of RA clearance.

40|$|Fear is a common, core emotion. Moreover, anxiety {{disorders}} {{are among the}} most common form of psychiatric disease. In this thesis neuroimaging, genetic, pharmacological, brain stimulation and behavioral techniques were used in healthy subjects and specific patient populations to shed more light on the neuroanatomical and pharmacological systems that underlie human fear and anxiety. Our results provide new insights into the limbic upregulation and prefrontal downregulation of defensive states. We delineated neuroanatomical systems that may play an important role in fear regulation in response to the on- and offset of acute stressors. We extended work that implicated common genetic variation in serotonin transporter function as a possible prelude to anxiety by showing that serotonin transporter genotype is associated with basic defensive reactivity as indexed by fear-potentiated startle and functional magnetic resonance imaging measures of anxiety. We made first steps in the development of paradigms that may aid in the discovery of new and improved medication for {{anxiety disorders}}. Finally, we performed fear-potentiated startle measurements in two very rare populations: subjects <b>with</b> <b>a</b> rare <b>genetic</b> <b>defect</b> leading to selective calcification of the lateral amygdala and subjects that received deep brain stimulation at the ventral striatum to treat severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms. The latter two studies enabled us to obtain unique information on the contribution of these brain regions to fear learning and basic defensive reactions...|$|R
40|$|A trial {{fibrillation}} (AF), {{the most}} common human cardiac arrhythmia, is associated with abnormal intracellular Ca 2 + handling. Diastolic Ca 2 + release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum via "leaky" ryanodine receptors (RyR 2 s) is hypothesized to contribute to arrhythmogenesis in AF, but the molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we have shown that mice <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>genetic</b> gain-of-function <b>defect</b> in Ryr 2 (which we termed Ryr 2 R 176 Q/+ mice) did not exhibit spontaneous AF but that rapid atrial pacing unmasked an increased vulnerability to AF in these mice compared with wild-type mice. Rapid atrial pacing resulted in increased Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) phosphorylation of RyR 2, while both pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of CaMKII prevented AF inducibility in Ryr 2 R 176 Q/+ mice. This result suggests that AF requires both an arrhythmogenic substrate (e. g., RyR 2 mutation) and enhanced CaMKII activity. Increased CaMKII phosphorylation of RyR 2 was observed in atrial biopsies from mice with atrial enlargement and spontaneous AF, goats with lone AF, and patients with chronic AF. Genetic inhibition of CaMKII phosphorylation of RyR 2 in Ryr 2 S 2814 A knockin mice reduced AF inducibility in a vagotonic AF model. Together, {{these findings suggest that}} increased RyR 2 -dependent Ca 2 + leakage due to enhanced CaMKII activity is an important downstream effect of CaMKII in individuals susceptible to AF inductio...|$|R
