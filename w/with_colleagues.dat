That same year, he sponsored an ordinance that effectively blocked police officers, city inspectors, and other city employees from inquiring about a resident's immigration status. The ordinance forbids police officers from arresting a suspect solely {{on the grounds of}} a suspected immigration status violation.|$|E

5|$|The rise of African {{nationalism}} {{generated a}} white backlash in Southern Rhodesia, with the right-wing Rhodesian Front winning the December 1962 general election. The new government sought to preserve white minority rule by tightening security and establishing full {{independence from the}} United Kingdom. Mugabe met <b>with</b> <b>colleagues</b> at his house in Salisbury's Highbury district, where he argued that as political demonstrations were simply being banned, {{it was time to}} move towards armed resistance. Both he and others rejected Nkomo's proposal that they establish a government-in-exile in Dar es Salaam. He and Hayfron skipped bail to attend a ZAPU meeting in the Tanganyikan city. There, the party leadership met Tanganyika's President, Julius Nyerere, who also dismissed the idea of a government-in-exile and urged ZAPU to organise their resistance to white minority rule within Southern Rhodesia itself.|$|E

5|$|In 1987, Sorkin {{started using}} {{marijuana}} and cocaine. He {{has said that}} in cocaine he found a drug that gave him relief from certain nervous tensions he deals with on a regular basis. In 1995, he checked into rehab at the Hazelden Institute in Minnesota, {{on the advice of}} his then girlfriend and soon to be wife Julia Bingham, to try to beat his addiction to cocaine. In 2001, Sorkin along <b>with</b> <b>colleagues</b> John Spencer and Martin Sheen received the Phoenix Rising Award for their personal victories over substance abuse. However, two months later on April 15, 2001, Sorkin was arrested when guards at a security checkpoint at the Burbank Airport found hallucinogenic mushrooms, marijuana, and crack cocaine in his carry-on bag when a metal crack pipe set off the gate's metal detector. He was ordered to a drug diversion program.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{determined}} Yeates {{had spent}} the evening of 17 December 2010 <b>with</b> <b>colleagues</b> at the Bristol Ram pub on Park Street, leaving at around 8:00pm to begin the 30-minute walk home. She told friends and colleagues {{that she was not}} looking forward to spending the weekend alone as it would be her first in the flat without Reardon; she planned to spend her time baking in preparation for a party the couple would be throwing the following week, and shopping for Christmas. Yeates was seen on closed-circuit television (CCTV) at around 8:10pm leaving a Waitrose supermarket without purchasing anything. She phoned her best friend, Rebecca Scott, at 8:30pm to arrange a meeting on Christmas Eve. The last known footage of Yeates recorded her buying a pizza from a branch of Tesco Express at around 8:40pm.

5|$|On 4 July 1902 (the {{day of his}} death) Vivekananda awoke early, went to {{the monastery}} at Belur Math and meditated for three hours. He taught Shukla-Yajur-Veda, Sanskrit grammar and the {{philosophy}} of yoga to pupils, later discussing <b>with</b> <b>colleagues</b> a planned Vedic college in the Ramakrishna Math. At 7:00p.m. Vivekananda went to his room, asking not to be disturbed; he died at 9:10p.m. while meditating. According to his disciples, Vivekananda attained mahasamādhi; the rupture of a blood vessel in his brain was reported as a possible cause of death. His disciples believed that the rupture was due to his brahmarandhra (an opening in the crown of his head) being pierced when he attained mahasamādhi. Vivekananda fulfilled his prophecy {{that he would not}} live forty years. He was cremated on a sandalwood funeral pyre {{on the bank of the}} Ganga in Belur, opposite where Ramakrishna was cremated sixteen years earlier.|$|E

5|$|Shaoguan {{authorities}} {{moved the}} Uyghur workers to temporary accommodation, {{and the workers}} were transferred on 7 July to another facility belonging to Early Light, 30km away in Baitu town. The Baitu factory is now reported to be an Uyghur enclave, with, sporting facilities, canteen serving Xinjiang food, a round-the-clock staff clinic, and plain-clothed police officers in their midst. According to the South China Morning Post, the Kashgar staff were apparently unable to mix <b>with</b> <b>colleagues</b> in their previous location because of the language barrier – a local shop worker estimated that less than one in three spoke Mandarin. Two months on, the South China Morning Post found few {{willing to talk about}} the events of the fateful night. The authorities' claims that 50 Uyghur workers were granted their repatriation requests following the violence are contested by Uyghur workers.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher became closely {{aligned with}} the Cold War {{policies}} of US President Ronald Reagan, based on their shared distrust of Communism. A disagreement came in 1983 when Reagan did not consult {{with her on the}} invasion of Grenada. During her first year as Prime Minister she supported NATO's decision to deploy US nuclear cruise and Pershing II missiles in Western Europe, permitting the US to station more than 160cruise missiles at RAF Greenham Common, starting on 14 November 1983 and triggering mass protests by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. She bought the Trident nuclear missile submarine system from the US to replace Polaris, tripling the UK's nuclear forces at an eventual cost of more than £12billion (at 1996–97 prices). Thatcher's preference for defence ties with the US was demonstrated in the Westland affair of 1985–86, when she acted <b>with</b> <b>colleagues</b> to allow the struggling helicopter manufacturer Westland to refuse a takeover offer from the Italian firm Agusta in favour of the management's preferred option, a link with Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation. Defence Secretary Michael Heseltine, who had supported the Agusta deal, resigned in protest.|$|E
