2500|$|After being [...] "utterly inspired" [...] by Jonathon Porritt's book Seeing Green, Lucas {{joined the}} Green Party in 1986. She {{recalled}} in 2007: [...] "I thought, right! I'm going there now" [...] to the Green's main office on Clapham High Street, near where she lived. [...] "I'm {{just going to}} dedicate {{the rest of my}} life to this party". Soon afterwards she became the party's National Press Officer (1987–89) and Co-Chair (1989–90). Lucas has a reputation as a party moderniser, in terms of internal slang, a [...] "spiky" [...] rather than a [...] "fluffy". In a 2009 Guardian interview, she told Decca Aitkenhead: [...] "when I was putting people up to go on TV programmes I'd be saying to them, 'What are you planning to wear?', and they'd be slightly offended that I'd even think of asking the question. But I do genuinely think that has changed, a lot. It's a recognition, not that there's some kind of terrible compromise about putting on a tie, but that actually you don't want people to be focusing on <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> like but on what you're saying".|$|E

Good day, old friend; <b>what,</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> {{somewhat}} worn; And {{yet it is}} a day to {{test your}} health Ev'n at the best: I scarce have spoken with you Since when?--your degradation. At your trial Never stood up a bolder man than you; You would not cap the Pope's commissioner-- Your learning, and your stoutness, and your heresy, Dumbfounded half of us. So, after that, We had to dis-archbishop and unlord, And make you simple Cranmer once again. The common barber dipt your hair, and I Scraped from your finger-points the holy oil; And worse than all, you had to kneel to me; Which was not pleasant for you, Master Cranmer. Now you, that would not recognise the Pope, And you, that would not own the Real Presence, Have found a real presence in the stake, Which frights you back into the ancient faith: And so you have recanted to the Pope. How are the mighty fallen, Master Cranmer! ...|$|E

I pushed Tibb's wife overboard. <b>What!</b> <b>You</b> <b>look</b> surprised and shrink away. Surely you had guessed that by this time. I would have shot you that day through the partition, but unfortunately you were not there. I tried again afterwards, but you were awake. I shot Tibbs. I think the idea of suicide was carried out rather neatly. Of course when once {{we got on the}} coast the rest was simple. I had bargained that all on board should die; but that stone of yours upset my plans. I also bargained {{that there should be no}} plunder. No one can say we are pirates. We have acted from principle, not from any sordid motive." ...|$|E
