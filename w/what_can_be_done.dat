5|$|Having {{completed}} those chapters which analyse {{the relevant}} aspects {{of power in}} social life, Russell shifts his focus onto the philosophical issues that are connected with those problems. Moving into this new terrain, he wonders <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to curb the efforts of those who love power. The answers can be found either in possible collective actions, or in individual duties.|$|E
5|$|Many LARPs have game {{rules that}} {{determine}} how characters can affect {{each other and}} the setting. The rules may be defined in a publication or created by the gamemasters. These rules may define characters' capabilities, <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> with various objects that exist in the setting, and what characters can do during the downtime between LARP events. Because referees are often not available to mediate all character actions, players are relied upon to be honest in their application of the rules.|$|E
5|$|At Dunder Mifflin, Charles Miner (Idris Elba) {{announces that}} the Scranton branch, {{previously}} the company's most profitable office, has lost ten major clients to Michael's company. Chief Financial Officer David Wallace (Andy Buckley) visits Scranton to see <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> {{to stem the}} losses. In a blatant about-face from his no-nonsense persona, Charles blatantly sucks up to David, which Jim notices. David calls a meeting with Charles and Jim (John Krasinski), but Charles insists Dwight (Rainn Wilson) also be present {{because he had been}} Charles's right-hand man. However, during the meeting Dwight embarrasses Charles with outlandish suggestions, such as unleashing a hive of bees.|$|E

5|$|Cochrane's own sympathies lie most {{strongly}} with utilitarianism and liberalism; {{his own account}} is most influenced by them. He argues that rights derived from considerations of interests can protect individual animals and place limits on <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to them. These rights cannot be violated, even {{in the name of}} the greater good, which means that the cultural and economic practices of human beings will be affected. Anticipating criticism, Cochrane explains that not every interest leads to a right. A full consideration of this argument is outside the scope of the book. The argument was expanded in Cochrane's Animal Rights Without Liberation (2012) which, though published after An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory, was based on his doctoral thesis.|$|E
25|$|ZooNorth is the {{original}} and oldest section of the zoo. It features {{a wide range of}} exhibits such as the Otter Outpost, Galápagos tortoises, and Bug U!. The Hill, one of {{the original}} parts of the zoo, was closed as many of the animals there were moved to the new Giants of the Savanna exhibit. One of the more recent additions to ZooNorth is the Wildlife Amphitheater. The Wildlife Amphitheater is home to SOAR! A Festival of Flight. Primate Place features monkeys, with species from Africa and South America. ZooNorth is also home to the Pierre A. Fontaine Bird & Reptile Building where visitors are encouraged to learn about endangered reptiles, amphibians, and <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> to save them.|$|E

Influenza pandemics from its genetic offspring may include influenza A virus subtypes other than H5N1. While genetic analysis of the H5N1 virus shows that influenza pandemics from its genetic offspring can easily be far more lethal than the Spanish flu pandemic, planning for a future influenza pandemic is based on <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> and there is no higher Pandemic Severity Index level than a Category 5 pandemic which, roughly speaking, is any pandemic as bad as the Spanish flu or worse; and for which all intervention measures are to be used.|$|E

25|$|He once {{claimed to}} be {{considering}} a career in law enforcement and was on reality television show Armed & Famous. The show was pulled from CBS in January 2007, and Osbourne was sued by a woman from Muncie, Indiana, whose house was accidentally raided during filming. Osbourne also filmed a programme for the BBC's Saving Planet Earth series. In it he travelled to Namibia to highlight the tensions between elephants and the local people, and <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> so that both groups can live peacefully beside one another. He also {{took part in the}} Mongol Rally with News Corporation director Andrew Knight's daughter, Amaryllis Knight. Their challenge was to drive a car with under 1000cc from London to Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, for charity. Osbourne and his family reunited with a reality TV show on Fox that debuted 31 March 2009 but was cancelled after the first episode.|$|E

When Roosevelt published Outdoor Pastimes of an American Hunter in October 1905, however, he not only dedicated it to the elder naturalist, but he also made his first public foray in what would {{become known as the}} nature fakers controversy: [...] "I wish to express my hearty appreciation of your warfare against the sham nature-writers—those whom you have called 'the yellow journalists of the woods'... You in your own person have illustrated <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> by the lover of nature who has trained himself to keen observation, who describes accurately what is thus observed, and who, finally, possesses the additional gift of writing with charm and interest." ...|$|E

He {{is the director of}} a lace factory, has a wife, children, and grandchildren, though he has no real affection for his family and continues his homosexual encounters when he travels on business. He hints of an incestuous love, which we learn later was for his twin sister. He explains that he has decided to write about his experiences during the war for his own benefit and not as an attempt to justify himself. He closes the introduction by saying, [...] "I live, I do <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> it's the same for everyone, I am a man like other men, I am a man like you.

500|$|Writing for Time magazine, Jay Cocks {{observed}} {{the show to}} integrate [...] "sleek high tech and smooth dance rhythm into an evening of snazzy soul with a social conscience."

[...] Several critics noted Jackson lip synced portions of the show, {{in a similar fashion}} to her contemporaries. Jon Pareles commented, [...] "most lip-synched shows are done by video-era pop performers whose audiences are young and television trained. They fill arenas to enjoy a spectacle like what they saw on television—the dancing... the stage effects and incidentally the songs."

500|$|In {{an issue}} of Catalyst, the Catholic League responded to Rosenberg's article.

But now we have a Fox executive producer disingenuously giving away his hand by protesting why it should be okay to offend another group of people with the same material he initially said wasn't offensive to Catholics! And isn't it striking that Rosenberg is upset {{with the fact that the}} double standard—which now, for the first time works positively for Catholics—is a real problem. Never do we remember Rosenberg protesting the double standard that allows 'artists' to dump on Catholics while protecting most other segments of society from their assaults."
