5|$|According {{to friends}} and family, he had {{extensive}} historical knowledge and was deeply disillusioned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of communist Poland. He supported the protesting students during the March 1968 Polish political crisis in Poland, printing bibuła leaflets and asking his daughter to distribute them. According to health professionals, he was of sound mind, and fully rational, {{at the time of}} his suicide. Siwiec planned his self-immolation months in advance, writing out a last will in April, and leaving written and tape-recorded statements explaining his revulsion at both the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia and the People's Republic of Poland's participation in it.|$|E
5|$|Ethnic Cleansing was {{developed}} {{by members of the}} National Alliance, an American white supremacist organization, and published by Resistance Records, its subsidiary record label that specializes in white power music. It {{was developed}} for Microsoft Windows personal computers using Eclipse Entertainment's open-source game engine Genesis3D along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reality</b> Factory development kit. The source code was not substantially changed from the original. Instead, the developers simply plugged in images and sounds that they had created in freely available editing programs.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad Ilyas, {{the founder}} of Tablighi Jamaat, {{wanted to create a}} {{movement}} that would enjoin good and forbid evil as the Qur'an decreed, as his teacher Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi dreamed of doing. The inspiration for this came during his second pilgrimage to Mecca in 1926. What he lacked in scholarly learning, presence, charisma or speaking ability, he made up for in zeal. He initially tried to establish a network of mosque-based religious schools to educate the Mewati Muslims about Islamic beliefs and practices. Shortly afterwards, he was disappointed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> that these institutions were producing religious functionaries, but not preachers.|$|E

5|$|All Souls {{suffered}} from low viewership, and {{was placed on}} hiatus following the broadcast of the fist two episodes. It was originally paired <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> television show Chains of Love. All Souls was canceled after the remaining four episodes were broadcast. In later interviews, the actors had varying views on the reasons behind the show's cancellation. It has never been released on DVD or Blu-ray, or made available on online-streaming services. Critical response to All Souls was primarily positive, with commentators praising its use of horror and paranormal elements. Critics compared the show to other horror and science-fiction television series, specifically The X-Files {{and the work of}} American writer Stephen King.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{over the}} state of the {{environment}} around the most popular parts of the Mont Blanc massif, and the need for visitors to better respect it, were reflected in a statement in 2014 by Jean-Marc Peillex, the mayor of Saint-Gervais, who said:Mont Blanc is a heap of garbage... a mountain covered with the crap, urine and detritus of the last 50 years. The problems are covered up by a nice, white blanket of snow. But I want to confront people <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> and to reach those people who abuse the mountain. Following the construction of the new Goûter Hut used by most climbers ascending Mont Blanc, the authorities now strictly enforce a 'no wild-camping' ban above the level of Tête Rousses Hut. Each high altitude hut faces its own individual challenges, often relating to water and energy supply or waste management, and the provision of services to visitors can sometimes conflict with environmental protection. A range of individual solutions for a selection of huts within the massif and elsewhere in the Alps was identified by a project run by Espace Mont Blanc between 2007 and 2013.|$|E

25|$|The Second World War {{was also}} a {{divisive}} issue.

25|$|Brenner, {{torn between}} hope and despair, {{struggled}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of the Zionist enterprise in the Land of Israel. Agnon, Brenner's contemporary, fused {{his knowledge of}} Jewish heritage with the influence of 19th and early 20th century European literature. He produced fiction dealing with the disintegration of traditional ways of life, loss of faith, and the subsequent loss of identity. In 1966, Agnon was co-recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature.|$|E
25|$|Once victims {{leave their}} perpetrator, {{they can be}} stunned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> {{of the extent to}} which the abuse has taken away their autonomy.

25|$|Reviews have {{praised the}} novel's realism, {{believable}} characters and dialogue, {{sense of place}} and {{the complexity of the}} novel. The Guardian picked out Pelecano's ability to provide authentic voices for his characters but criticised instances where the narrative voice was inconsistent <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of the character. Other reviewers have commented that the gory detail and social realism may be offputting for some readers. The New York Times commented that the blaming of some of the characters' behaviour on the absence of father figures may be an oversimplification.|$|E
25|$|Training and {{preparing}} for war also involves significant dangers, as do other military duties. Consequently, many military brats live <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of risk to one or both parents even {{when there is no}} active war. Peacetime military accidents claim lives every year at a significantly higher rate than accidents for the civilian population; some service professions such as military pilots, paratroopers and other airborne soldiers, aircraft carrier flight deck workers, Coast Guard sea rescue, ordnance or munitions workers, Naval firefighters, as well as those training or drilling in live ammunition exercises, all experience higher annual death rates. Such casualties are difficult, if not impossible, to keep hidden from children or teenagers in small base communities.|$|E
25|$|Unger's ideas {{developed}} in a context where young intellectuals and radicals attempted to reconcile the conventional theories of society and law being taught in university classrooms <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of social protest and revolution of the 1960s and 70s. Disillusioned with Marxism, they turned to thinkers like Levi-Strauss, Gramsci, Habermas, and Foucault in attempt to situate understandings of law and society as a benign science of technocratic policy within a broader system of beliefs that legitimized the prevailing social order. Unlike Habermas, however, who formulates procedures for attaining rational consensus, Unger locates resolution in institutions and their arrangements that remain perpetually open to revision and reconstruction. And, unlike Foucault, who also emphasizes the constructed character of social life, Unger takes {{this as an opportunity}} to reimagine institutions and social conditions that will unleash human creativity and enable liberation.|$|E

25|$|Up {{until this}} point, the WCW {{contingent}} were being built up to being malcontent faces rising {{up against the}} heel Vince McMahon, because of Vince's bluster during the final Nitro broadcast and Shane's usurping of the WCW ownership. Originally, WCW talents were meant to attack strictly heel WWF wrestlers. The strongly negative reaction of the core WWF viewership to the WCW product and talent, however, coupled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> that a WCW wrestling program to appeal to WWF fans would not come to fruition, led to the entire WCW contingent to abruptly turn heel. One example was the heel gimmick of then WCW Alliance member Diamond Dallas Page, whose first appearance in the WWF was built up over several weeks in a storyline {{in which he was}} portrayed as an anonymous stalker sending invasive videotapes to then face The Undertaker.|$|E
25|$|Beginning <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of disaster, Lamentations {{concludes with}} the bitter {{possibility}} that God may have finally rejected Israel (chapter 5:22). Sufferers {{in the face}} of grief are not urged to a confidence in the goodness of God; in fact God is accountable for the disaster. The poet acknowledges that this suffering is a just punishment, still God is held to have had choice over whether to act in this way and at this time. Hope arises from a recollection of God's past goodness, but although this justifies a cry to God to act in deliverance, {{there is no guarantee that}} he will. Repentance will not persuade God to be gracious, since he is free to give or withhold grace as he chooses. In the end, the possibility is that God has finally rejected his people and may not again deliver them: if God is predictable, then God is just a tool of humans. Nevertheless, it also affirms confidence that the mercies of Yahweh (the God of Israel) never end, but are new every morning (3:22–33).|$|E
25|$|Ruiz de Burton uses {{irony and}} satire to mock American {{political}} discourses and practices by ridiculing socio-political {{structures of the}} period. Using a variety of rogues, who have pretentious and comical names, Ruiz de Burton represents the vices of nineteenth-century middle-class society. The preachers, Mr. Hackwell and Mr. Hammerhard, the neighbors, the Cackles, and other political figures in Who Would Have Thought It? are unmasked to break down ideological myths of American political rhetoric by contrasting {{the expectations of the}} nation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of their actions. American expectations include promoting civil virtue and acting against corruption. However, Mr. Hackwell, the primary religious figure in the novel, schemes to increase his wealth in order to satisfy his ravenous greed. The Cackles clan represents Northern politicians who are only motivated by self-interest. Ruiz de Burton implies that the national practice of self-deception, misrepresentation and secrecy are deeply rooted in the American character, though very rarely revealed. Juxtaposed to this satire of American life are the virtues of the good and beautiful Lola.|$|E

25|$|Towards this end, Hamilton {{added to}} the Committee local {{attorney}} Hughes Spalding, chairman of the Fulton-DeKalb Hospital Authority, which owned and operated Grady Memorial Hospital. Hamilton and Spalding proposed the separate but equal black facility, in spite of leaders {{in the black community}} pressing for full integration in society. Hamilton saw it as a beginning, but black leaders saw it as being out of touch <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> of the times. The Hospital Authority donated the land for the hospital site, adjacent to Grady. Spalding won endorsements from county commissioners of Fulton and DeKalb, as well as the Fulton County Medical Society and area newspapers, which helped promote the concept. By 1949, $1.725 million in funds had been raised, with the remaining funding to come from the state and the Hospital Authority. Ground was broken on February 1, 1950. Named the Hughes Spalding Pavilion, it was dedicated May 29, 1952. Hamilton was named as secretary to the advisory board of trustees. In 1955, Hamilton and black members of Atlanta's legal and medical community organized Foundation for the Advancement of Medical and Nursing Education, with Hamilton as secretary. The foundation raised $10,000. No one applied for the money. Black interns could not serve at Grady. The United States Public Health Service provided $40,000 in surgery grants.|$|E
