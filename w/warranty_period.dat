40|$|A {{stochastic}} model is developed {{which can be}} used to set <b>warranty</b> <b>periods</b> so that a small percentage of items sold in a store are returned for rebates, repairs or replacements. If return to the store provides benefits to the retailer such as purchase of upgrades, ability to sell additional related goods or to sell snacks and other unrelated merchandise, while the customer is waiting, then profits may be maximized by setting <b>warranty</b> <b>periods</b> so that a larger percentage of the population will revisit the store. Results for products with initially high failure rates (TV sets, complex electronic components and cellular phones) versus products with gradually increasing failure rates (tires, batteries) are compared using simulations. Initially high rates of failure in conjunction with revenues from additional purchases that are greater than zero and initial losses that are low may be more lucrative than revenues from gradually increasing wear out replacements. Minimal levels of additional purchases, initial loss in value and rate reduction per number of periods can be established based on realistic simulation data in order for retailers and manufacturers to facilitate profit maximization using warranty policy.

40|$|Many systems {{might have}} a long time dormant period, during which the systems are not operated.

Developing optimal burn-in policies for such products is important when warranty cost is analysed. This paper considers two burn-in policies, which incur different burn-in costs, and have different burn-in effects on the products. A special case about the relationship between the failure rates of the products at the dormant state and at the operating state is presented.

40|$|In {{practical}} warranty services management, faults may {{not always}} be found in claimed items by warranty service agents, which is the well-known no-fault found phenomenon (for example, caused by a loose connection between parts, or simply human error).

Little research, however, considers this phenomenon in warranty management since faults are normally assumed {{to be found in the}} claimed items. On the basis of different levels of testing, this paper proposes three warranty return policies, which decide whether new items should be sent to warranty claimants or not.

40|$|Early {{replacement}} of EEE {{has often been}} argued {{in conjunction with the}} continuous improvement of energy efficiency in the use phase. Recent LCA studies show that the raw materials and manufacturing phase of many EEE have a proportionally increasing environmental impact.

This paper shows that the production, with about 56 % of the GWP of a notebook has a significantly higher impact than the use phase. Moreover, GWP of the production of a notebook are so high, that they cannot be compensated in realistic time-periods by energy efficiency gains of new products.

50|$|By {{the early}} 90's, as Apple Computer, Inc., began to {{withdraw}} {{support for the}} Apple II series {{and focus on the}} Macintosh line, the market for Apple II hardware and software began to wane. Many Apple II users began to migrate to other platforms, such as the Macintosh and IBM PC-compatibles. In an attempt to capitalize on its well-known brand name among previous Apple II owners, Applied Engineering began to market products for the Macintosh and Commodore Amiga lines. However, because of stiff competition in already active markets, and AE's late entries, Applied Engineering could not duplicate the success it had experienced with the Apple II. Around the same time, cost cutting measures were implemented, such as shortening <b>warranty</b> <b>periods,</b> charging for technical support (via a 1-900 number) and a using inferior parts, turning off loyal and time customers. Eventually dwindling Apple II sales and a failure to shift into other markets caused Applied Engineering to go out of business by 1994.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{performance}} capability measure is proposed that {{is useful in}} a wide class of production processes. Traditional quality improvement methodologies concentrate on getting the process right {{in order to meet}} the capability requirements of the product immediately after production, as measured for a key quality characteristic by one of the popular capability indexes. This is not the best strategy when the characteristic degrades over time in use. The implications of this type of degradation on targeting the production process are investigated and illustrated for five typical degradation models. A method is given which enables the optimum settings for the target values of the process mean and standard deviation to be chosen, given a particular model for product degradation. Commonly used philosophies which advocate targeting at the centre of the specification range are shown to be sub-optimal. A useful consequence of better targeting practice is that <b>warranty</b> <b>periods</b> can be extended without increasing the costs associated with supporting warranty claims...|$|R
