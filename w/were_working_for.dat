5|$|The {{so-called}} NatWest Three — Giles Darby, David Bermingham and Gary Mulgrew — were extradited to the United States in 2006 {{on charges}} relating to a transaction with Enron Corporation in 2000 while they <b>were</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> Greenwich NatWest. It {{has been argued}} that the alleged crime was committed by British citizens living in the UK against a British company based in London and therefore, any resulting criminal case falls {{under the jurisdiction of the}} English courts. However, the Serious Fraud Office decided not to prosecute due to lack of evidence. There has been criticism that the Americans do not have to produce a prima facie case, or even a reasonable one, to extradite British citizens, whereas no such facility exists to extradite US citizens to the UK. On 28 November 2007 the three admitted one charge of wire fraud after a plea bargain. On 22 February 2008 they were each sentenced to 37 months in prison.|$|E
25|$|A lifelong Democrat who {{maintained}} a cordial {{working relationship with}} the Roosevelt Administration, Davis nonetheless feared the long-term social and cultural effects of industrialization — effects already reflected in {{the growing number of}} Americans who <b>were</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> employers rather than for themselves.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the UFW {{organized}} strikes and boycotts—including the Salad Bowl strike, the largest farm worker strike in U.S. history—to protest for, and later win, higher wages for those farm workers who <b>were</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> grape and lettuce growers. He again fasted to draw public attention. UFW organizers {{believed that a}} reduction in produce sales by 15% was sufficient {{to wipe out the}} profit margin of the boycotted product.|$|E

25|$|Democratic {{political}} machines, especially Tammany Hall in Manhattan, opposed woman suffrage {{because they}} {{feared that the}} addition of female voters would dilute the control they had established over groups of male voters. By {{the time of the}} New York State referendum on women's suffrage in 1917, however, some wives and daughters of Tammany Hall leaders <b>were</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> suffrage, leading it to take a neutral position that was crucial to the referendum's passage.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{question}} of whether the killings were an illegal staged event or not is separate from whether the people who were killed <b>were</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> the LeT, the family of Ishrat Jahan and several politicians and activists have maintained that she was innocent, and that question has continued to be disputed. The CBI declared that the encounter was staged, but did not comment on whether Ishrat Jahan was an LeT associate or not.|$|E
25|$|When Edward Akroyd (1810–1887) {{bought this}} {{building}} in 1838, on his engagement to Elizabeth Fearby of York, {{it was a}} much smaller eight-roomed house, built ca 1800. He and his brother Henry <b>were</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> their father Jonathan Akroyd, a rich worsted mill owner, and living at Woodside Mansion in Boothtown. Jonathan died in 1848, and it was possibly Edward's inheritance which paid {{for the development of}} Bankfield which began around this time. Edward encased the 18th century building in fairfaced stone and added two loggias, a dining room, Anglican chapel and kitchens.|$|E

They {{were found guilty}} of illegal entry and sentenced to twelve years' hard labor in June 2009. North Korean leader Kim Jong-il pardoned the two on August 5, 2009, the day after former U.S. President Bill Clinton arrived in the country on a publicly unannounced visit.|$|E
25|$|Demolition of Ungdomshuset {{began at}} 8 am on 5 March 2007. A {{demolition}} crane started its {{work at the}} back of the house with the top floor. The logos on the crane were covered and workers wore masks to conceal their identity. The union representing Ungdomshuset was on the ground trying to persuade the workers to stop working and reveal the company they <b>were</b> <b>working</b> <b>for.</b> At 10am the Danish Working Environment Authority (Arbejdstilsynet) had the demolition interrupted due to reported concerns about dust and the potential presence of asbestos. The demolition resumed at 11am. At 4pm, about one-third of the house had been removed. The demolition was broadcast live by webcam on TV2 News' website.|$|E
25|$|The fate {{of most of}} the unreturned {{passengers}} has {{not been}} confirmed. They were educated, upper-class people; Song Yeong-in of the National Intelligence Service once commented that they were probably retained by North Korea specifically for their propaganda value. In 1992, Oh Kil-nam claimed that the two flight attendants as well as Hwang and Gim were employed making propaganda broadcasts to the South; he also said he heard from his daughter that the captain and first officer <b>were</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> the Korean People's Air Force. The mother of one of the flight attendants, Seong Gyeong-hui, was allowed to visit the North to see her daughter as part of the family reunions agreed to in the June 15th North–South Joint Declaration; during their meeting, she claimed that she and the other flight attendant Jeong Gyeong-suk remained friends and were living in the same town.|$|E

25|$|The first {{commercially viable}} mining company was John Munroe Longyear's Arctic Coal Company, which {{established}} Longyear City (from 1925 Longyearbyen). By 1910, 200 men <b>were</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> the company. The town and mines were {{bought by the}} Norwegian-owned Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani in 1916. Another early entrepreneur was Ernest Mansfield and his Northern Exploration Company. He started marble mining on Blomstrandhalvøya, but the marble was unusable and his company never had any profitable ventures, despite surveying {{large parts of the}} island. By the 1910s, it was established that coal was the only economically viable mining activity on Svalbard. Swedish interests established mines at Pyramiden and Sveagruva, while Dutch investors established Barentsburg in 1920. During the First World War, Norway saw the advantage of increasing self-supply of coal and Kings Bay established mining in Ny-Ålesund in 1916.|$|E
25|$|In late October 1943, {{there were}} still a few Jews housed in the Citadel who <b>were</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> the German army. On October 28, the Nazis and Latvian {{auxiliaries}} rounded up these people and transferred them to the Kaiserwald concentration camp. By this time, some of the Jews had managed to find or buy arms, and there was resistance to this action. Others killed their family members and then themselves to prevent being taken. A few escaped or hid, some {{with the help of}} at least two German soldiers, one named Liederman, the other Bruendl. A very small number (said to be 26 total), were permitted to stay on in the Citadel to work for the German army. On December 4, 1943, the Latvia police arrested these last Jews, leaving only three survivors who were still in hiding in the Citadel.|$|E
25|$|In a November {{afternoon}} of 1999, Cárdenas {{learned that a}} Gulf Cartel informant was being transported through Matamoros, Tamaulipas, by the FBI and DEA. According to the story mentioned in the interviews 11 years after this life-or-death incident, the DEA agent Joe DuBois and FBI agent Daniel Fuentes were riding in a white Ford Bronco with diplomatic plates along the streets of Matamoros, Tamaulipas. For years, both <b>were</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> the disarticulation of the cartels in Mexico, and both knew how the drug cartels worked south of the border. In {{the back seat of}} the car, a Mexican informant from a local newspaper on crime coverage guided the two agents and gave them a tour on the city's drug routes and on the homes of the drug lords of the city. They even cruised by Cárdenas' house, a pink-colored mansion with tall walls, security cameras, armed guards and roof-snipers. Within moments, according to DuBois, a Lincoln Continental was on their tail, then a stolen pickup truck with Texan plates. The federal agents were cut off and surrounded by at least five vehicles, including one by a former state police officer. Just yards away from Matamoros' police department, the agents were surrounded by a convoy of gunmen from the Gulf Cartel, which included Costilla Sánchez. Some wore police and military uniforms. Nearby, other men, also in police uniform, directed traffic.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Henry {{is taken}} by Greg and Tamara through the jungle. Henry points out their unfounded trust in Peter Pan, a {{statement}} which begins to worry {{them when they}} discover the walkie-talkie they use {{to communicate with the}} Home Office is filled with sand. The Lost Boys soon find them, and reveal themselves to be the Home Office Greg and Tamara worked for, much to their displeasure. The leader of the Lost Boys, Felix, reveals that the plan was never to destroy magic, and that Greg and Tamara aren't meant to return to their world. The Shadow arrives and rips Greg's shadow from his body when he refuses to hand over Henry, and Tamara is shot with an arrow. Henry flees in the confusion, and is taken aside by a fellow runaway. The runaway reveals that he was a former Lost Boy, and stole pixie dust from Pan, hoping to escape from Neverland. However, he cannot make himself fly with it. Gold arrives {{at the scene of the}} skirmish, and finds Tamara still alive. She tells him that Henry ran, and that she and Greg had no idea that they <b>were</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> Pan. She also apologizes about Neal, but Gold crushes her heart. He and Felix meet in a clearing, with Felix welcoming Gold but warning him that if he is in Neverland for Henry, that makes him Pan's enemy. Rumpelstiltskin remarks that nothing has changed, and scoffs at the idea of his survival, only wanting to take down as many Lost Boys as he can before he dies. Felix responds by leaving behind a doll of a child, which reduces Rumpelstiltskin to tears.|$|E
500|$|In general, {{advertisements}} tend {{to reflect}} the popular attitudes surrounding the appropriate gender roles of the time. For example, in the 1920s, when such a tiny proportion of wives <b>were</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> economic gain outside of their homes, it was [...] rare to see wives portrayed within advertising in a role in which they <b>were</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> monetary gain. Instead, women were primarily portrayed doing household tasks. The exceptions to this rule came about in times of economic hardship when wives were thrown into the labor force to ensure a families’ economic survival. One of these times was the Great Depression during the 1930s.|$|E

[...] Late in the race, Goldwater appeared to make a public statement critical of McCain, but Tower persuaded Goldwater not to confirm it to reporters and the damage was limited. McCain benefited from the support of Duke Tully's The Arizona Republic, the state's most powerful newspaper.|$|E
