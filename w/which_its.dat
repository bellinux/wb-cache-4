5|$|Oganesson is {{a member}} of group 18, the zero-valence elements. The members of this group are usually inert to most common {{chemical}} reactions (for example, combustion) because the outer valence shell is completely filled with eight electrons.

It is thought that similarly, oganesson has a closed outer valence shell in <b>which</b> <b>its</b> valence electrons are arranged in a 7s27p6 configuration.|$|E
