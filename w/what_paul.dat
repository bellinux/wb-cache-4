5|$|As a precautionary move Alboin {{strengthened}} his {{alliance with}} the Avars, signing <b>what</b> <b>Paul</b> calls a foedus perpetuum ("perpetual treaty") and what is {{referred to in the}} 9th-century Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani as a pactum et foedus amicitiae ("pact and treaty of friendship"), adding that the treaty was put down on paper. By the conditions accepted in the treaty, the Avars were to take possession of Pannonia and the Lombards were promised military support in Italy should the need arise; also, for a period of 200years the Lombards were to maintain the right to reclaim their former territories if the plan to conquer Italy failed, thus leaving Alboin with an alternative open. The accord also had the advantage of protecting Alboin's rear, as an Avar-occupied Pannonia would make it difficult for the Byzantines to bring forces to Italy by land. The agreement proved immensely successful, and relations with the Avars were almost uninterruptedly friendly during the lifetime of the Lombard Kingdom.|$|E

The next day, Liz asks Jenna if she knows <b>what</b> <b>Paul</b> does, but Jenna is aware of his work, having met Paul at a Jenna Maroney impersonator contest in which he won and Jenna herself placed fourth. Liz does not approve of the relationship and confronts Paul, asking what his intentions are with Jenna. Paul tells her that he is not using Jenna to further his career, but that he is with her because she accepts him for who he is. Liz is convinced by their touching (although weird) display of care for each other, ultimately approving of their relationship.|$|E

5|$|For {{the events}} {{surrounding}} 572, the most exhaustive source available is Paul the Deacon's Historia Langobardorum, {{a history of the}} Lombard nation up to 744. The book was finished {{in the last two decades}} of the 8th century, after the Lombard Kingdom had been conquered by the Franks in 774. Because of the apparent presence in the work of many fragments preserved from Lombard oral tradition, Paul's work has been often interpreted as a tribute to a vanishing culture. Among these otherwise lost traditions stands the tale of Alboin's death. According to Herwig Wolfram, <b>what</b> <b>Paul</b> deals with is an example of how nationally vital events were personalized to make them easier to preserve in the collective memory. Even later than the Historia Langobardorum, but possibly using earlier lost sources, are the last two primary sources to speak about Helmichis: the anonymous Historia Langobardorum Codicis Gothani and the Liber Pontificalis Ecclesiae Ravennatis written by Andreas Agnellus. The first is a brief Christianizing version of the Origo that was made in the first decade of the 9th century from a Carolingian point of view. The second was written in the 830s by a priest from Ravenna and is a history of the bishops who held the see of Ravenna through the ages. Agnellus' passage on Alboin and Rosamund is mostly derived from Paul and little else.|$|E

However, she suffers an MS relapse and is treated by Rhys. Susan attends a yoga class and befriends the teacher, Bernard Cabello. Bernard asks Susan out for a drink, but she declines. However, she changes her mind and asks Bernard to dinner instead. Susan invites Bernard {{to go and see}} Karl's band play at Charlie's. At the end of the night, Bernard shocks Susan by suddenly kissing her. Susan then tries to avoid Bernard and Vanessa Villante (Alin Sumarwata) tells him that Susan is not interested in dating him. Susan befriends Rhys's mother, Elaine (Sancia Robinson), but Rhys angrily tells Susan to stay away from Elaine. He later apologises. Susan goes to Montreal for a course, but returns home early to discover that Paul was planning to take back his job as editor.|$|E
5|$|The {{festivals and}} daily rituals do not adhere to {{standard}} Hindu Agamic or Buddhist rituals. It follows <b>what</b> <b>Paul</b> Younger calls as ancient Vedda traditions of worship. Although since the medieval period Hindus, Buddhists and even Muslims {{have tried to}} co-opt the temple, deity and its worship as their own, the rituals maintained by the native priests are still intact. The main festival known in Sinhalese as Esela Perehera. It is celebrated during the months of July and August. About 45 days before the festival begins, the priests go into the forest and find two forked branches of a sacred tree. The branches are then immersed in the local river and kept at the shrines dedicated to Kataragama deviyo and Vali. When the main festival begins, the Yantra representing the deity is retrieved from its storage location, paraded through a street {{on top of an}} elephant, and carried to the Valli shrine. After two hours it is returned. On {{the last day of the}} festival the Yantra is left overnight at the Valli shrine and brought back to the main shrine. The priests conduct the rituals in silence, covering their mouths with white cloth. Associated with the main festival is fire walking arranged by a master of the ritual. Hundreds of devotees participate in fire walking, yet others participate in ecstatic dance forms called Kavadi and body piercing. Many of the pilgrims exhibit signs of being possessed.|$|E

25|$|The recent New Perspective on Paul {{has added}} {{significant}} support to a moral influence {{view of the}} atonement by reinterpreting many passages previously used against it. Some scholars now believe that Paul's teachings against works of the law referred only to ritualistic customs such as circumcision and dietary rules, not to moral good works in general. There has likewise {{been a great deal}} of discussion about <b>what</b> <b>Paul</b> means by 'faith', and in particular the view that the Greek word concerned generally meant 'faithfulness' is receiving widespread support. Moral influence adherents have pointed out that Paul's statements about salvation (i.e. moral change) through faith (i.e. faithfulness to Christ's teachings) are therefore not in conflict with a moral influence view, and instead support such a view.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, Peter Paul was {{a lawyer}} in Miami, Florida, {{representing}} foreign governments and political leaders in South America and the Caribbean.

500|$|In September 1954 a stage [...] {{version of}} the Diary, by Basil Dean and Richard Blake, was {{presented}} at London's Arts Theatre [...] with a cast that included George Benson and Dulcie Gray as the Pooters and Leslie Phillips as Lupin. Anthony Hartley, writing in The Spectator, classed this production as [...] "fair-to-middling", with sympathetic performances from the principals: [...] "t is a precondition {{of this kind of}} play that everybody concerned should have a heart of gold: only in the case of Mr. Pooter's employer, Mr. Perkupp, do we actually hear the metal chinking." [...] In 1986 Waterhouse presented an adaptation of his [...] "Mrs Pooter" [...] text at the Garrick Theatre, with Judi Dench and Michael Williams. This version [...] was revived in 1993 at the Greenwich Theatre in a production by Matthew Francis. [...] Clive Swift and Patricia Routledge played Charles and Carrie, in <b>what</b> <b>Paul</b> Taylor in The Independent described as [...] "essentially a two-hander... in which all the other folk (including Lupin Pooter, the uppish, worrying son) are either imagined characters or, at times, impersonated by the Pooters". In March 2011 the Diary was the subject of an even less orthodox production at the Royal & Derngate Theatre, Northampton. Adapted by Hugh Osborne, with an all-male cast led by Robert Daws, this supposes that [...] Pooter has arranged for his diaries to be performed by amateur actors. Quentin Letts of the Daily Mail found this [...] "an evening of some of the cleverest, fastest entertainment I have seen for months". [...] Lyn Garner in The Guardian found it [...] "a show of some charm – though one that, like Pooter himself, does not quite have the credentials to be quite so pleased with itself". In 2014 a production of the Diary was staged in London by Rough Haired Pointer at the White Bear Theatre and later transfered to the King's Head Theatre. Originally intended as a play for 6 actors the loss of the sole actress due to an emergency after the opening night left the original production with an all male cast performing thirty one characters. Time Out said of the production, [...] "it captures the original’s sharp subtext, frivolous wit and heavy irony, while also being very, very silly". Largely favourable reviews saw the play transfer to the King's Head. For the transfer the play was reworked with a now deliberate all male cast of four playing forty five characters. This new version received positive notices from fringe reviewers but by its second run at the King's Head the Guardian's Lyn Gardener was less enamoured noting there were, [...] "some nice touches, in particular the black and white cardboard cut-out-style design that offers a nod to the original illustrations. But the relentless comic business featuring doors and human lampshades slow the action and lead to perfunctory performances: it’s caricature, not character. (What is) totally missing is the original’s tenderness and affection for Charles." ...|$|E
