5|$|In {{incidents}} on 18 April, 21 May and 15 December, {{tear gas}} grenades <b>were</b> <b>fired</b> at Rajab's {{house in the}} village of Bani Jamra by unknown assailants. In the first incident, HRW identified the grenades thrown into the Rajab family's compound as US-manufactured munitions to which only Bahrain's security forces would have had access. Tear gas penetrated into the adjacent home of Rajab's 78-year-old mother who suffers from respiratory disease, causing her great distress. On 21 May, four gas grenades <b>were</b> <b>fired</b> at the house. This time, according to Rajab, the grenades were smaller than those used in the mid-April assault and there were no marks identifying the manufacturer.|$|E
5|$|In mid-April, Armbrust rockets <b>were</b> <b>fired</b> from Croatian {{positions}} outside Borovo Selo {{into the}} village. According to {{one version of}} the event, several rounds <b>were</b> <b>fired</b> at agricultural machinery that served as barricades in the outskirts of Borovo Selo. According to a second version, three rockets <b>were</b> <b>fired</b> on the village with the specific aim of inflaming ethnic tensions. One of the rockets hit a house and another landed in a field, failing to explode. There were no casualties, but the already tense situation was made worse when the unexploded rocket was shown on Serbian Television as evidence of Croatian aggression against Serbs. The rockets <b>were</b> <b>fired</b> {{by a group of}} men that were led to the site by Osijek police chief Josip Reihl-Kir, who was later murdered by Croat irregulars. Croatia's interior minister Josip Boljkovac said the group included Deputy Defence Minister Gojko Šušak, Branimir Glavaš and Vice Vukojević. Šušak claimed {{he had nothing to do}} with the incident but had been in the area at the time. Nikola Jaman, at the time a commander of the local Police Reserve unit, said that he led the action and denied that Šušak, Glavaš and Vukojević were in the group. Jaman noted that the action was planned together with Reihl-Kir.|$|E

On 1 April, Serb villagers around Vukovar and other towns in eastern Slavonia began to erect barricades across main roads. The White Eagles, a Serbian paramilitary {{group led by}} Vojislav Šešelj, moved into the Serb-populated village of Borovo Selo just north of Vukovar. In mid-April 1991, Armbrust shoulder-launched anti-tank missiles <b>were</b> <b>fired</b> at Borovo Selo. According to one version of the event, missiles <b>were</b> <b>fired</b> at agricultural machinery that served as barricades. According to a second version, three missiles <b>were</b> <b>fired</b> at houses inhabited by Serbs. There were no casualties, but the attack aggravated and deepened ethnic tensions. On 2 May, Serb paramilitaries ambushed two Croatian police buses in the centre of Borovo Selo, killing 12 policemen and injuring 22 more. Three Serbs were also killed.
