5|$|The {{critical}} and commercial {{success of the}} film of David Copperfield led to an invitation to return to Hollywood in 1936. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> {{he found that the}} studio executives had no idea which films they wanted him to work on, and he had eight weeks of highly paid leisure, during which he wrote a short story and worked on a novel. He was eventually asked to write the scenario for Little Lord Fauntleroy, which he enjoyed doing. He spent most of his fees on paintings, forgetting to keep enough money to pay US tax on his earnings. He replenished his American funds with a lecture tour – his last – in late 1936.|$|E
5|$|In December 1942, during World War II, Charles Allen Thomas, {{a chemist}} and {{director}} of research at Monsanto in St. Louis, joined the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) as the deputy chief of its Division 8, which was responsible for propellants, explosives and the like. Early in 1943, he traveled to the east with Richard C. Tolman, a member of the NDRC, and James B. Conant, the president of Harvard University {{and the chairman of the}} NDRC, to witness a demonstration of a new underwater explosive. Conant and Tolman took the opportunity to quietly investigate Thomas' background. He was then invited to a meeting in Washington D.C., with Brigadier General Leslie R.

25|$|Phillip {{had a very}} {{difficult}} time assembling the fleet which was to make the eight-month sea voyage to Australia. Everything a new colony might need had to be taken, since Phillip had no real idea of what he might find <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>there.</b> There were few funds available for equipping the expedition. His suggestion that people with experience in farming, building and crafts be included was rejected. Most of the 772 convicts (of whom 732 survived the voyage) were petty thieves from the London slums. Phillip was accompanied by a contingent of marines {{and a handful of other}} officers who were to administer the colony.|$|E

Gordon disobeyed orders and left on the first ship to China, an action that very much angered the Army's commander, the Duke of Cambridge. Gordon arrived in Shanghai in July and met Li Hongzhang, and learned that there was risk of war with Russia. After meeting his old friend, Gordon assured Li that if Russia should attack he would resign his commission in the British Army {{to take up a}} commission in the Chinese Army, an action that if taken risked prosecution under the Foreign Enlistments Act. Gordon informed the Foreign Office that he willing to renounce his British citizenship and take Chinese citizenship as he would not abandon Li and his other Chinese friends should a Sino-Russian war begin. Gordon's willingness to renounce his British citizenship in order to fight with China in the event of war did much to raise his prestige in China.|$|E

On returning to the Seventh Army, he was ordered to join the 2ème groupement cuirassé, a scratch force of armoured and mechanised units that included Brigadier General Stanisław Maczek's Polish 10th Armoured Cavalry Brigade. The groupement [...] launched a series of counter-attacks. Lacking a radio, de Hauteclocque gave directions to the Char B1 tanks with his cane. On 15 June, he was wounded in the head during a German air attack, and was taken to a hospital in a convent in Avallon. There he was again taken prisoner when the area was overrun by the Germans.|$|E

[...] Had Hillery done so, it would have forced FitzGerald's resignation as Taoiseach and enabled the Dáil to nominate someone else for the post--presumably Haughey. Hillery is said to have angrily rejected such pressure, regarding it as gross misconduct. He granted FitzGerald the dissolution.|$|E
2500|$|The {{publication}} of Sexual Behavior in the Human Female prompted even more intensive news coverage: Kinsey {{appeared on the}} cover of the August 24, 1953, issue of Time. The national news magazine featured two articles on the scientist, one focusing on his research, career and new book, the other on his background, personality, and lifestyle. In the magazine's cover portrait, [...] "Flowers, birds, and a bee surround Kinsey; the mirror-of-Venus female symbol decorates his bow tie." [...] The lead article concludes with the following observation: [...] "'Kinsey...has done for sex what Columbus did for geography,' declared a pair of enthusiasts...forgetting that Columbus did not know where he was <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>there....</b> Kinsey's work contains much that is valuable, but it must not be mistaken for the last word." [...] That same year, Kinsey appeared as a character in an episode of the Jack Benny TV program (September 15, 1953), in which he and his research were written into a sketch about Benny's 'fantasy' about Marilyn Monroe, a guest on the program.|$|E

2500|$|Once, Saint Anthony tried {{hiding in}} a cave to escape the demons that plagued him. There were so many little demons in the cave though that Saint Anthony's servant had to carry him out because they had beaten him to death. When the hermits were {{gathered}} to Saint Anthony's corpse to mourn his death, Saint Anthony was revived. He demanded that his servants take him back to that cave where the demons had beaten him. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>there</b> he called out to the demons, and they came back as wild beasts to rip him to shreds. All of a sudden a bright light flashed, and the demons ran away. Saint Anthony knew that the light must have come from God, and he asked God where was he before when the demons attacked him. God replied, [...] "I was here but I would see and abide to see thy battle, and because thou hast mainly fought and well maintained thy battle, I shall make thy name to be spread through all the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|The mood aboard Bismarck was mixed. Seaman Adolf Eich was {{off duty}} for some fresh air.

Lindemann was shaking the hand of Adalbert Schneider for his Knight's Cross award bestowed upon him for the destruction of Hood. Lütjens also looked pleased. As the morning wore on the atmosphere changed. Müllenheim-Rechberg saw Lindemann wearing a life jacket and watched as the captain ate his breakfast in silence. He did not return Müllenheim-Rechberg's salute. Müllenheim-Rechberg also met Lütjens as the Admiral {{made his way to the}} bridge. Lütjens returned his salute as he brushed past but said nothing. To Müllenheim-Rechberg it seemed as if the two men most responsible for Bismarck had retreated into their own private worlds. That morning, on the 27 May 1941, Lütjens sent a request for a U-Boat to pick up the ship's war diary. In this last transmission, Lütjens included: [...] "Ship no longer manoeuvrable. We fight to the last shell. Long live the Führer". Lütjens did not hide their fate from his crew. He ordered the ships stores to be opened and allowed the crew to help themselves. It was a sign to all onboard Bismarck was doomed.|$|E
2500|$|Affectionately nicknamed [...] "Go" [...] and towering at {{a whopping}} five-foot [...] "ape", the Gorilla is the Phoenix Suns {{favorite}} primate. Most notably, fans {{are familiar with}} the Gorilla for his on the court antics where he raises the Phoenix Suns flag in the name of team-pride, performs notorious slam dunk routines and fires up the crowd. From his early days in the Banana Republic to his education at Fur-man University, the Gorilla has always had a passion for basketball. Before his debut with the Phoenix Suns, the Gorilla delivered singing telegrams. However, in 1980 the Gorilla's fate changed when he stepped onto the court during a game and surprised unsuspecting players and fans. His antics became an instant hit and the Gorilla {{has been a member of}} the Phoenix Suns ever since. Since then, the gorilla, has been known for his slapstick humor during the games such as his stadium stairs all to the sound of the Rocky Theme, and the fantastic dunks that are performed before each 4th quarter. The Gorilla would do a few push-ups on the court, then head off in a quest to climb the stairs of both the lower and upper level of the Coliseum to get to the top. When he reached the base of the upper level, he’d stop for a second to soak up the applause, then head to the top of the building. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> the crowd would explode. It never failed. Also, one of his more beloved skits was at a Knicks home game where he came out to Frank Sinatra's Theme from New York, wearing a hat, with several pieces of garbage stuck to his leg. Halfway through the song, a group of [...] "muggers" [...] attacked him, and he staggered off the court afterwards. Give him credit, The Gorilla has always been more than a slapstick comedian. In a way, though, that's what makes The Gorilla so much fun. He's not really there just to cheer on the Suns – although he does so with great enthusiasm. The Gorilla just wants to have fun, and wants the rest of us to have fun with him.|$|E
