25|$|Secondary {{education}} is separated into {{junior and senior}} years. In junior years, the curriculum is a broad one where history, geography and science are studied alongside subjects {{that have already been}} studied at primary schools. In senior years, this becomes more selective and students have a choice over <b>what</b> <b>and</b> how much is to be studied. Almost all schools but PLK Vicwood KT Chong Sixth Form College and its feeder junior secondary college have both sessions.|$|E
25|$|In April 1997, Martha Palmer and Marc Light {{organized}} a workshop entitled Tagging with Lexical Semantics: Why, <b>What,</b> <b>and</b> How? {{in conjunction with}} the Conference on Applied Natural Language Processing. At the time, there was a clear recognition that manually annotated corpora had revolutionized other areas of NLP, such as part-of-speech tagging and parsing, and that corpus-driven approaches had the potential to revolutionize automatic semantic analysis as well. Kilgarriff recalled that there was “a high degree of consensus that the ﬁeld needed evaluation,” and several practical proposals by Resnik and Yarowsky kicked off a discussion that {{led to the creation of}} the Senseval evaluation exercises.|$|E
25|$|After {{dropping}} {{out of high school}} at the age of 17, Rice began an in-depth study of early 20th-century art movements, producing his own abstract black and white paintings and experimental photographs. Early on, he met European art historian and gallery owner Arturo Schwarz, with whom he began a long correspondence. Schwarz, a biographer of Duchamp and Man Ray, encouraged Rice to pursue his art, no matter <b>what.</b> <b>And</b> he did. Though he would later shift his focus to sound, he has never stopped creating visual art and has given a number of one man shows over the years.|$|E

5000|$|For Aristotle, logos is {{something}} more refined than the capacity to make private feelings public: it enables the human being to perform as no other animal can; it {{makes it possible for}} him to perceive and make clear to others through reasoned discourse the difference between <b>what</b> is advantageous <b>and</b> <b>what</b> is harmful, between <b>what</b> is just <b>and</b> <b>what</b> is unjust, <b>and</b> between <b>what</b> is good <b>and</b> <b>what</b> is evil.|$|R
25|$|The matrix in the {{following}} table shows how Brasel and colleagues found that the teachers combined these four questions to learn about two dimensions of teaching: student thinking and instruction. The authors found that while the most productive collaborative discussions—that allowed the teachers {{to learn more about}} mathematics content, students and pedagogy—focused more on why and how, the teachers tended to address only the first two questions, <b>what</b> <b>and</b> to whom. While these conversations were helpful in identifying students in need of remediation, they did little in the way to improve instruction in the long run.|$|E
25|$|Parents {{commonly}} cite {{two main}} motivations for homeschooling their children: {{dissatisfaction with the}} local schools and the interest in increased involvement with their children's learning and development. Parental dissatisfaction with available schools typically includes concerns about the school environment, the quality of academic instruction, the curriculum, bullying, and lack {{of faith in the}} school's ability to cater to their children's special needs. Some parents homeschool in order to have greater control over <b>what</b> <b>and</b> how their children are taught, to cater more adequately to an individual child's aptitudes and abilities, to provide instruction from a specific religious or moral position, and {{to take advantage of the}} efficiency of one-to-one instruction and thus allow the child to spend more time on childhood activities, socializing, and non-academic learning. Many parents are also influenced by alternative educational philosophies advocated by the likes of Susan Sutherland Isaacs, Charlotte Mason, John Holt, and Kenneth Robinson.|$|E
25|$|In {{the privacy}} of their own homes, people are more casual in {{relation}} to clothing, though what each considers appropriate varies considerably. <b>What</b> <b>and</b> how much clothing a person removes depends on a number of considerations, including the cultural background and on whether the person is alone in {{the privacy of}} their own homes. The removal of overclothing, such as coats, hats, gloves, scarves and the like, is the norm in virtually all households. It is also common for people to remove outdoor shoes when entering one's home and at times guests may also be expected to do the same. It is also common to change out of work clothes (such as a suit and tie, overalls etc.) into something lighter, looser and more comfortable, and perhaps for a woman to remove her bra or stockings. Beyond that, how much more is removed depends on personal taste, habits, circumstance and relationships of the people inside the household at a particular time.|$|E

50|$|In its {{exposition}} of progressive meditation for Self-knowledge, the Chandogya Upanishad starts {{by referring to}} the outer worldly knowledges as name.

25|$|Part of satire {{originates}} {{from the}} events surrounding the feud between Walpole and William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath that gained intensity during {{the creation of the}} Treaty of Seville and during the Civil List debate. Later in January 1731, Sir William Yonge, 4th Baronet produced Sedition and Defamation Display'd, a pamphlet that mocked Pulteney and defended Yonge's friend, Walpole. Pulteney, in return, dueled with John Hervey, 2nd Baron Hervey, another Walpole friend, after mistaking that it was Hervey who wrote Sedition and Defamation Display'd. Although no one was hurt, the fighting continued in the form of pamphlet attacks until 1 July 1731 when King George II removed Pulteney from the Privy Council. Many works began to satirise elements of the battle between Pulteney and Walpole, including the poems The Devil Knows <b>What</b> <b>and</b> The Compromise (March 1731); these poems depict both Pulteney and Walpole as equivalent complicit in the unfolding events, which is later picked up by Fielding.|$|E
25|$|Hook goes {{calling for}} Emma and {{stands on a}} rooftop to get attention. He jumps off, and Emma uses magic to take him safely to the ground, before asking {{why he was so}} sure she’d save him. He says he was optimistic, and then asks what {{happened}} between them in Camelot. He says he forgives her, but she says that she's the Dark One and forgiveness. Hook says there’s nothing she’s done could be as bad as what he’s done. He shows her a ring that belonged to Barnaby, and whom he killed front of his wife. He says that every ring he wears is a sad story. She shows him the ring he gave her to keep safe, and he says it was the saddest story of all; it belonged to a man better than him, his brother Liam. She tries to give it back but he tells her to keep it. He says he wore rings as trophies and now they’re just reminders. When Emma asks if Hook wants to know the truth, no matter how terrible, Hook says he loves her no matter <b>what,</b> <b>and</b> Emma says she needs to show him something. She takes him to her house and she points him to a telescope. He looks and sees the sea and a full moon over the waves. She says he told her the ocean calmed him and he says it’s a nice home she picked, but Emma says that he picked it, not her. He looks at the newspaper and recognized his handwriting on it. She says he told her this was their future and she says everything she did was to keep that future alive. He asks again for the truth and she says they’re almost there and kisses him. She says she can’t tell him everything because he would try and stop her. After the kiss, Hook gets groggy and asks what she's doing, before passing out.|$|E
25|$|Poirot {{is asked}} for help by a physician, Dr Charles Oldfield, who has a {{practice}} in Market Loughborough, a small village in Berkshire. His wife died {{just over a year}} ago and the malicious talk in the village is that he poisoned her. People are avoiding him and several poison pen letters have been sent to him but he can do nothing to stem this tide of ill-intentioned gossip – like the heads of the Lernaean Hydra, when one source of the gossip is cut off, another grows in its place. So, his ultimate aim was to cut the main source of the gossip, just like the hydra had been slain by cutting its vulnerable head. Mrs Oldfield was a difficult invalid whose death was put down to a gastric ulcer, whose symptoms are similar to that of arsenic poisoning. She left her husband a not-inconsiderable sum of money and, under pressure, Oldfield admits {{that a lot of the}} talk revolves around Jean Moncrieffe, his young dispenser, who he wants to marry but dare not because of the talk. Poirot travels to Market Loughborough and meets Jean. She is frank about her relationship with Oldfield and her dislike of his wife but opposes Poirot's idea of an exhumation and autopsy on the body. Poirot makes the rounds of the village, insinuating that he is connected with the Home Office and thereby generating much hypocritical murmurs of sympathy for the doctor and, more importantly, names of who said <b>what</b> <b>and</b> when. From this he learns of the present whereabouts of two servants of the Oldfields who left their employ after Mrs Oldfield died; Nurse Harrison, who tended to the patient, and Beatrice, the family maid. Nurse Harrison tells a story of overhearing Jean and the Doctor talking about the imminent death of his wife in which it was clear that this was an event that both of them were impatiently waiting for. The nurse is certain that Beatrice must have overheard the talk as well. Poirot tells her of the supposed plans of exhumation and the nurse considers this news and then tells him she agrees that such a thing should be done. While being interviewed, Beatrice slyly denies overhearing any conversation but tells him of several suspicious stories of Jean making medicines or pots of tea for Mrs Oldfield which the nurse poured away or changed before the patient could take them.|$|E

Inferring from their faulty maps that the distances to each were about equal, they decided to try for the bigger depot at Cape Flora. Strindberg took more pictures during this week than he would at any later point, including 12 frames that make up a 360-degree panorama of the crash site.|$|E
