[...] He felt that the [...] "biggest shock of all" [...] was the reveal of Rudy as Dexter's brother, and described their confrontation as [...] "riveting". Goldman gave the episode an [...] "incredible" [...] rating of 9.5 out of 10.

[...] Jonathan Toomey of TV Squad felt {{that it would be a}} [...] "shame" [...] if Hall did not win a Golden Globe Award, saying that he [...] "certainly deserves it." [...] He understood why Rudy wanted to make Debra the brothers' first victim together; Rudy was jealous of the life that Dexter received and killing Debra was the symbol of that life dying. Although Toomey said that the episode was [...] "really well written," [...] he was troubled that no one made the connection between Dexter and Rudy when all they had to do was read Rudy's file, but Toomey speculated that it could be discovered the next season.|$|E
