50|$|Sunspel {{was begun}} in 1860 as a {{clothing}} manufacturer and <b>West</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>cotton</b> importer by Thomas Hill, and {{claims to have}} been the first fashion retailer to produce a T-shirt style clothing top, pre-dating the US Navy’s development of the T-shirt in 1913. The company took on the official name of Sunspel in 1937. In 1947, Sunspel was also the first company to develop the boxer short undergarment in the UK. In 1985, Sunspel was featured in a controversial advertisement for Levi’s, in which actor Nick Kamen stripped down to reveal his Sunspel boxers underneath. The company was sold to Nicholas Brooke and Dominic Hazlehurst in 2005 by Peter Hill, a descendant of the company’s founder, whose family had retained ownership of the company over the years. In the 2000s, Sunspel clothing was used to outfit the fictional film character James Bond in the Bond movies Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace. Then in 2011, Sunspel released its first womenswear line.|$|E

40|$|This study {{provides}} causal {{evidence that a}} shock to the relative supply of inputs to production can (1) affect the direction of technological progress and (2) lead to a rebound in the relative price of the input that became relatively more abundant (the strong induced-bias hypothesis). I exploit {{the impact of the}} U. S. Civil War on the British cotton textile industry, which reduced sup-plies of cotton from the Southern U. S., forcing British producers to shift to lower-quality <b>Indian</b> <b>cotton.</b> Using detailed new data, I show that this shift induced the development of new technologies that augmented <b>Indian</b> <b>cotton.</b> As these new technologies became available, I show that the relative price of Indian/U. S. cotton rebounded to its pre-war level, despite the increased rela-tive supply of <b>Indian</b> <b>cotton.</b> This is the first paper to establish both of these patterns empirically, lending support to the two key predictions of leading di-rected technical change theories...|$|R
50|$|This {{effect was}} {{due to the fact that}} the whole of the Southern United States was {{dominated}} by cotton farming and production and during the war the production of cotton fell because of the Confederate States of America's focus on military production. Certain trade embargoes also lead to a considerable reduction in the export of cotton from the United States. The lack of American cotton lead to a large influx of <b>Indian</b> <b>cotton,</b> which was of a significantly lesser quality and yet still more expensive because of transportation expenses. The lack of American cotton had caused the price of <b>Indian</b> <b>cotton</b> to skyrocket.|$|R

40|$|The modern global textile {{industry}} requires cotton with strong and consistent fibers {{in order to}} produce high quality goods at the high speeds necessary to recover capital costs. The introduction of high volume instrument (HVI) measurement of cotton fiber quality has strengthened the link between cotton prices and attributes on world markets. The spread of genetically modified (GMO) cotton in India has driven India to the second ranked producer and exporter of cotton in the world. However, contamination and other quality problems are endemic to <b>Indian</b> <b>cotton.</b> Using a unique data set of <b>Indian</b> <b>cotton</b> prices and quality attributes from 5 Indian states, this study uses hedonic price modeling to demonstrate that the linkages between cotton quality and price are weaker in India than they are in the United States.

40|$|The leading {{theory of}} {{directed}} technical change, developed by Acemoglu (2002), offers two main predictions. First, when inputs are sufficiently substitutable, {{a change in}} relative input supplies will generate technical change that augments inputs which become relatively more abundant. Second, if this effect is sufficiently strong, the long-run relative price of the relatively more abundant inputs will increase – the strong induced-bias hypothesis. This paper provides the first empirical test of these predictions using the shock to the British cotton textile industry caused by the U. S. Civil War (1861 - 1865). Using detailed new patent data, I show that the shock increased innovation in Britain directed towards taking advantage of <b>Indian</b> <b>cotton,</b> which had became relatively more abundant. The relative price of <b>Indian</b> <b>cotton</b> first declined and then rebounded, consistent with strong induced-bias. Given my elasticity of substitution estimates, {{these findings are consistent}} with the predictions of the theory...|$|R

40|$|Halogenated very {{short-lived}} substances (VSLSs) {{are naturally}} {{produced in the}} ocean and emitted to the atmosphere. When transported to the stratosphere, these compounds can have a significant influence on the ozone layer and climate. During a research cruise on RV Sonne in the subtropical and tropical <b>west</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean in July and August 2014, we measured the VSLSs, methyl iodide (CH 3 I) {{and for the first}} time bromoform (CHBr 3) and dibromomethane (CH 2 Br 2), in surface seawater and the marine atmosphere to derive their emission strengths. Using the Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART with ERA-Interim meteorological fields, we calculated the direct contribution of observed VSLS emissions to the stratospheric halogen burden during the Asian summer monsoon. Furthermore, we compare the in situ calculations with the interannual variability of transport from a larger area of the <b>west</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean surface to the stratosphere for July 2000 – 2015. We found that the <b>west</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean is a strong source for CHBr 3 (910  pmol m− 2  h− 1), very strong source for CH 2 Br 2 (930  pmol m− 2  h− 1), and an average source for CH 3 I (460  pmol m− 2  h− 1). The atmospheric transport from the tropical <b>west</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean surface to the stratosphere experiences two main pathways. On very short timescales, especially relevant for the shortest-lived compound CH 3 I (3. 5 days lifetime), convection above the Indian Ocean lifts oceanic air masses and VSLSs towards the tropopause. On a longer timescale, the Asian summer monsoon circulation transports oceanic VSLSs towards India and the Bay of Bengal, where they are lifted with the monsoon convection and reach stratospheric levels in the southeastern part of the Asian monsoon anticyclone. This transport pathway is more important for the longer-lived brominated compounds (17 and 150 days lifetime for CHBr 3 and CH 2 Br 2). The entrainment of CHBr 3 and CH 3 I from the <b>west</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean to the stratosphere during the Asian summer monsoon is lower than from previous cruises in the tropical west Pacific Ocean during boreal autumn and early winter but higher than from the tropical Atlantic during boreal summer. In contrast, the projected CH 2 Br 2 entrainment was very high because of the high emissions during the <b>west</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean cruise. The 16 -year July time series shows highest interannual variability for the shortest-lived CH 3 I and lowest for the longest-lived CH 2 Br 2. During this time period, a small increase in VSLS entrainment from the <b>west</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean through the Asian monsoon to the stratosphere is found. Overall, this study confirms that the subtropical and tropical <b>west</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean is an important source region of halogenated VSLSs, especially CH 2 Br 2, to the troposphere and stratosphere during the Asian summer monsoon...|$|R
