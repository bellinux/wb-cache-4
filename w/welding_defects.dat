40|$|Several weld defects like lack of fusion, {{blow-out}} holes, pores, cracks or undercuts {{can occur}} during laser welding. They can be crucial for product failure. Due to its complexity the laser welding {{process and the}} origin of its defects are only partially understood. Both experimental observation and numerical simulation is difficult. Beside generally accepted knowledge on <b>welding</b> <b>defects,</b> to a limited extent high speed imaging, particularly by X-ray transmission, and mathematical modelling have generated some understanding. However, experimental observation suffers from {{the small size of}} the process zone, from its high dynamics and from the hot environment, while the physical process is to complex for complete simulations. Besides avoiding <b>welding</b> <b>defects</b> through process understanding, detection is of importance in industrial production.
