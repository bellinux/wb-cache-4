5|$|All {{military}} {{aircraft in the}} DRC are operated by the Air Force. Jane's World Air Forces states that the Air Force has an estimated strength of 1,800 personnel and is organised into two Air Groups. These Groups command five wings and nine squadrons, of which not all are operational. 1 Air Group is located at Kinshasa and consists of Liaison Wing, Training <b>Wing</b> <b>and</b> Logistical <b>Wing</b> <b>and</b> has a strength of five squadrons. 2 Tactical Air Group is located at Kaminia and consists of Pursuit and Attack <b>Wing</b> <b>and</b> Tactical Transport <b>Wing</b> <b>and</b> has a strength of four squadrons. Foreign private military companies have reportedly been contracted to provide the DRC's aerial reconnaissance capability using small propeller aircraft fitted with sophisticated equipment. Jane's states that National Air Force of Angola fighter aircraft would {{be made available to}} defend Kinshasa if it came under attack.|$|E

5000|$|The Dacia Pick-Up {{was derived}} from the Dacia 1300 and was {{introduced}} in 1975. It was known as the Dacia 1302 and was made in three series: the first, with straight rear <b>wings</b> <b>and</b> a small rear window; the second, with corrugated rear <b>wings</b> <b>and</b> a small rear window; and the third, with corrugated rear <b>wings</b> <b>and</b> a full-size rear window.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first of}} {{indigenous}} Aviatik biplanes, designed by Robert Wild, was P13 type, flown in April-May 1912. It {{was built in}} several variants and featured large 3½-bay or 4-bay <b>wings</b> <b>and</b> [...] The type was widely used in competitions and gained high reputation. An improved design was P14 of 1913, with smaller 2½-bay <b>wings</b> <b>and</b> aerodynamic and structural refinements. Also in 1913, an ultimate refined design P15 was built, with 2-bay or 3-bay <b>wings</b> <b>and</b> a fail fin.|$|R

25|$|Trainers {{built from}} 1934 {{up to the}} early 1940s had a color scheme that {{featured}} a bright blue fuselage <b>and</b> yellow <b>wings</b> <b>and</b> tail sections. These <b>wings</b> <b>and</b> tail sections had control surfaces that actually moved {{in response to the}} pilot's movement of the rudder and stick. However, many trainers built during mid to late World War II did not have these <b>wings</b> <b>and</b> tail sections due to material shortages and critical manufacturing times.|$|R
5|$|For a {{study for}} the U.S. Air Force in the mid-1970s, Boeing {{investigated}} replacing the engines, changing to a new <b>wing,</b> <b>and</b> other improvements to upgrade B-52G/H aircraft {{as an alternative to}} the B-1A, then in development.|$|E
5|$|In many respects, the YF-22s were {{different}} from production F-22s. Contrary to the F-117 Nighthawk, which was initially difficult to control because of small vertical stabilizers, Lockheed over-specified the fin area on its YF-22. Therefore, the company reduced the size of those on F-22s by 20–30 percent. Lockheed recontoured {{the shape of the}} <b>wing</b> <b>and</b> stabilator trailing edges to improve aerodynamics, strength, and stealth characteristics; the <b>wing</b> <b>and</b> stabilitor sweep was reduced by 6° from 48°. Finally, to improve pilot visibility, the canopy was moved forward 7inches (178mm), and the engine intakes were moved rearward 14inches (356mm).|$|E

5|$|A {{reported}} 10,000 Celtic fans travelled to Germany {{to cheer}} on Celtic {{in the second}} leg. John Hartson returned from suspension to the starting line-up whilst defender Ulrik Laursen also came into the side; with Shaun Maloney and Jackie McNamara dropping out. After early pressure from Stuttgart, Celtic scored on 12 minutes; Hartson played a pass from midfield out wide right to Didier Agathe, who raced down the <b>wing</b> <b>and</b> on reaching the bye-line crossed in to the Stuttgart penalty box. Hartson headed the ball towards the back post and Alan Thompson scored with a diving header. Two minutes later Celtic extended their lead. Agathe was again the provider, racing 50 yards down the right <b>wing</b> <b>and</b> cutting {{the ball into the}} penalty box to Chris Sutton who scored from close range with a powerful shot. That left Stuttgart requiring to score five goals to salvage the tie. A comeback by the Bundesliga club saw them eventually win 3–2 on the second leg, but Celtic won the tie 5–4 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|According to Njal's Saga, Óspak was on {{the wing}} {{opposite}} King Sigtrygg Silkbeard.

However, that Óspak engaged Sigtrygg contradicts the historical opinion that Sigtrygg did not actually {{take part in the}} battle but was instead holding the garrison in reserve in Dublin.|$|E
5|$|After {{just over}} an hour, Gemmell {{finally managed to}} equalise for Celtic when Craig passed {{to him from the}} right <b>wing</b> <b>and</b> he scored with a {{powerful}} 25 yard shot.

With about five minutes remaining, a long-range shot from Bobby Murdoch was diverted by Stevie Chalmers past a wrong-footed Sarti. This proved to be the winning goal.|$|E
