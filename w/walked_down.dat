5|$|At {{the end of}} the speech, Sir Austen Chamberlain <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> {{and shook}} his brother's hand. The Import Duties Act 1932 passed Parliament easily.

5|$|Grant married Myrtis Ann Halliburton in 1939 {{after a brief}} courtship; {{they had}} known each other for ten months before they <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the aisle. When they met, he worked behind the dairy counter at the local A market where she was a customer.|$|E
5|$|As {{the match}} between Dusty Rhodes and Randy Savage {{was about to}} begin, Ted DiBiase {{appeared}} and {{announced that he had}} purchased Sapphire. Rhodes <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the aisle toward DiBiase and Sapphire but was attacked from behind by Savage. Savage controlled most of the match, and Sherri interfered to help him while the referee was distracted. Rhodes made a brief comeback, but Savage was able to pin him after hitting him with Sherri's purse, which was said to be loaded with a heavy object. After the match, Rhodes chased after DiBiase and Sapphire but was unable to catch up to their departing limousine.|$|E

5|$|It was {{a little}} strange. And {{definitely}} when I <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the aisle I was like, 'This is kind of creepy — there’s some other man standing there!' It was really beautiful. People were all really excited like it was really my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and I was like, 'Mom, it's a video. This is not my dress. This is not the real wedding.' But I think it’s {{just one of those}} moments that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before midnight, Taylor was {{led into}} the {{execution}} chamber and strapped to a chair 17 {{feet away from the}} shooters with a hood covering his head. Multiple bright lights covered Taylor. Sandbags were arranged behind him to prevent any ricochets. The captain <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the aisle, tapping each shooter on the shoulder to check to see if they were ready. At 12:03 a.m. Mountain Standard Time on January 26, 1996, every shooter fired at the count of five and the white cloth target on Taylor's chest flew off. His chest moved upward and his left hand tightened into a fist. His grip gradually loosened and his head fell back. A doctor checked Taylor's neck for a pulse and cut two holes in his hood to check for a pupillary light reflex. Taylor was declared dead at 12:07 a.m. and became the 49th person to be executed in the state of Utah since 1852.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{two main}} event matches came next, as Randy Savage defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against the Ultimate Warrior. Although Mr. Perfect had claimed {{that he would be}} in the corner of one of the competitors, he did not come to ringside for the {{beginning}} of the match. Savage and the Warrior traded the advantage back and forth, with Savage performing several clotheslines and punching his opponent and the Ultimate Warrior countering with atomic drops. Savage executed two double axe handles from the top rope, but the Warrior caught him when Savage attempted the move a third time. After the Warrior missed a move and fell outside the ring, Savage jumped from the top rope and performed another double axe handle. Once the wrestlers got back into the ring, Ric Flair and Mr. Perfect <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the aisle and stood at ringside. The match continued as normal until Perfect reached into the ring and tripped Savage, who was running to gain momentum for a maneuver. The Ultimate Warrior accidentally threw Savage into referee Earl Hebner. As a result of the ref bump, Hebner was not able to make the three-count when Savage pinned the Warrior after performing a diving elbow drop. Perfect and Flair revived the Ultimate Warrior, only to attack him when he stood up. The Warrior recovered and attempted a running splash, but Flair hit him with a chair. Savage saw the Warrior injured and realized that Flair and Perfect were causing trouble rather than trying to help either man. In retaliation, Savage jumped off the top rope to attack Flair, but Flair hit him in the leg with a chair. Savage was unable {{to get back into the}} ring, so the Ultimate Warrior won the match via countout. Flair and Perfect continued to attack Savage until the Warrior chased them away. Savage and the Ultimate Warrior then hugged and walked backstage together.|$|E

25|$|At around 6:00p.m. on June 4, 2014, Bourque {{purchased}} three {{boxes of}} ammunition {{in the presence}} of a friend, whose name has limited legal usage, and cannot be named, who did not find it unusual since the two of them planned to go to a shooting range. During the late hours of that same day, Bourque left his rented home, dressed in camouflage and carrying a rifle and a shotgun. He calmly <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> a road in his trailer park, passing several neighbours along the way.|$|E
25|$|Some penny-farthing riders {{used only}} back {{pedalling}} and got off and <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> steep hills, but most also used a brake. Having a brake meant that riders could coast down hill by taking their {{feet off the}} pedals and placing the legs over the handlebars, although most riders preferred to dismount and walk down steep hills. Putting the legs under the handlebars with the feet off the pedals placed on foot-rests on the forks had resulted in serious accidents caused by the feet getting caught in the spokes.|$|E
25|$|Father Ignatius' health {{had always}} been {{precarious}} at best and worn out with continual work, preaching and begging he {{suffered a heart attack}} and died alone in a ditch (the death he had often described as ideal for himself) on 1 October 1864. Fr. Ignatius was returning from giving a mission in Scotland at the end of September 1864. He stopped at Carstairs to visit an old friend. Leaving his luggage at the station, he <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the road through the countryside towards the house, and collapsed and died.|$|E

25|$|Field of 1000 Screams {{was first}} {{introduced}} in the 2007 Scarefest event {{and was the first}} maze at Alton Towers not situated inside a pre-existing building. The Field was located entirely outdoors in a moderately sized field of maize, which had to be planted especially for the event several months earlier. It purported to be a fictional village called Altonville that had become overrun by zombies. Visitors <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> a long pathway cut through the corn, and encountered characters and scares along the way, before the finale took place. The Field of 1000 Screams did not return for the 2010 event.|$|E
25|$|With {{their wedding}} hours away, Tyrion Lannister visits Sansa Stark to ease her {{apprehension}} {{at the prospect}} of being his wife. In the Sept of Baelor, Queen Regent Cersei Lannister threatens Margaery Tyrell with the story of House Reyne, former Lannister vassals who her father Tywin exterminated when they rebelled against their liege lord. After arriving at the Sept, Sansa is <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the aisle by King Joffrey Baratheon. In an effort to embarrass Tyrion, Joffrey removes the stepstool Tyrion was to use to cloak Sansa with the Lannister colors. After some snickering from the crowd, Tyrion gets Sansa to kneel, and they are married.|$|E
25|$|As I <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> at {{this place}} I was walled on both sides by those {{inaccessible}} high rocky barren hills which hang over one’s head in some places and appear very terrible; and from them springs many little currents {{of water from the}} sides and clefts which trickle down to some lower part where it runs swiftly over the stones and shelves in the way, which makes a pleasant rush and murmuring noise and like a snowball is increased by each spring trickling down on either side of those hills, and so descends into the bottoms which are a Moorish ground in which in many places the waters stand, and so form some of those Lakes as it did here.|$|E

25|$|During 1968, Collins {{noticed that}} his legs were not working as they should, first during {{handball}} games, then as he <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> stairs, his knee would almost give way. His left leg also had unusual sensations when in hot and cold water. Reluctantly he sought medical advice and the diagnosis was a cervical disc herniation, requiring two vertebrae to be fused together. The surgery was performed at Wilford Hall Hospital at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, and he spent three months in a neck brace. It also removed Collins from the crew of Apollo 9 and moved Jim Lovell up to the prime crew. When the Apollo 8 mission was changed from a CSM/LM in Earth orbit, to a CSM-only flight around the Moon, both prime and backup crews for the Apollo 8 and Apollo 9 swapped places.|$|E
25|$|Profits {{were made}} immediately, and in 1877 an {{additional}} seven cars were delivered, allowing the headway to drop to five minutes. The company {{became a major}} retailer of used horses. These were sought after due to the good treatment they received at the company. However, if they ever <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> a street with tracks they would follow these blindly and {{it was difficult to}} get them to diverge off the route. From 1878, the fare increased to 15 øre for all routes. KSS opened its first extension on 18 March 1878, when {{the first part of the}} Grünerløkka–Torshov Line opened from Storgata to Thorvald Meyers gate. It was further extended to Beyer Bridge on 12 April 1879. In conjunction with this a new depot was built at Olaf Ryes plass with place for fifty horses and a number of horsecars. The Vestbanen Line was extended to Munkedamsveien on 5 May 1879.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 4 November 1995 (12th of Heshvan on the Hebrew Calendar), Rabin was assassinated by Yigal Amir, a right-wing extremist who opposed {{the signing of the}} Oslo Accords. Rabin had been {{attending}} a mass rally at the Kings of Israel Square (now Rabin Square) in Tel Aviv, held in support of the Oslo Accords. When the rally ended, Rabin <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> the city hall steps towards the open door of his car, at which point Amir fired three shots at Rabin with a semi-automatic pistol. Two shots hit Rabin, and the third lightly injured Yoram Rubin, one of Rabin's bodyguards. Rabin was taken to the nearby Ichilov Hospital with considerable delay, where he died on the operating table less than 40 minutes later due to blood loss and a punctured lung. Amir was immediately seized by Rabin's bodyguards. He was later tried, found guilty, and sentenced to life imprisonment. After an emergency cabinet meeting, Israel's foreign minister, Shimon Peres, was appointed as acting Israeli prime minister.|$|E
