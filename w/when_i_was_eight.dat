500|$|Until he was fifteen, Elgar {{received}} a general education at Littleton (now Lyttleton) House school, near Worcester. However, his only formal musical training beyond piano and violin lessons from local teachers consisted of more advanced violin studies with Adolf Pollitzer, during brief visits to London in 1877–78. Elgar said, [...] "my first music was learnt in the Cathedral ... from books {{borrowed from the}} music library, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eight,</b> nine or ten." [...] He worked through manuals of instruction on organ playing and read every book he could find on the theory of music. He later {{said that he had}} been most helped by Hubert Parry's articles in the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. Elgar began to learn German, in the hope of going to the Leipzig Conservatory for further musical studies, but his father could not afford to send him. Years later, a profile in The Musical Times considered that his failure to get to Leipzig was fortunate for Elgar's musical development: [...] "Thus the budding composer escaped the dogmatism of the schools." [...] However, it was a disappointment to Elgar that on leaving school in 1872 he went not to Leipzig but to the office of a local solicitor as a clerk. He did not find an office career congenial, and for fulfilment he turned not only to music but to literature, becoming a voracious reader. Around this time, he made his first public appearances as a violinist and organist.|$|E

Between Sligo and Rosses Point, there is a tongue of land covered with coarse grass that runs out into the sea or the mud {{according}} to the state of the tide. It is the place where dead horses are buried. Sitting there, my father read me [...] "The Lays of Ancient Rome." [...] It was the first poetry that had moved me after the stable-boy's [...] "Orange Rhymes." [...] Later on he read me [...] "Ivanhoe" [...] and [...] "The Lay of the Last Minstrel," [...] and they are still vivid in the memory. I re-read [...] "Ivanhoe" [...] the other day, but it has all vanished except Gurth, the swineherd, at the outset and Friar Tuck and his venison pasty, the two scenes that laid hold of me in childhood. [...] "The Lay of the Last Minstrel" [...] gave me a wish to turn magician that competed for years with the dream of being killed upon the sea-shore. When I first went to school, he tried to keep me from reading boys' papers, because a paper, by its very nature, as he explained to me, had to be made for the average boy or man and so could not but thwart one's growth. He took away my paper and I had not courage to say that I was but reading and delighting in a prose re-telling of the Iliad. But after a few months, my father said he had been too anxious and became less urgent about my lessons and less violent if I had learnt them badly, and he ceased to notice what I read. From that on I shared the excitement which ran through all my fellows on Wednesday afternoons when the boys' papers were published, and I read endless stories I have forgotten as completely as Grimm's Fairy Tales that I read at Sligo, and all of Hans Andersen except the Ugly Duckling which my mother had read to me and to my sisters. I remember vaguely that I liked Hans Andersen better than Grimm because he was less homely, but even he never gave me the knights and dragons and beautiful ladies that I longed for. I have remembered nothing that I read, but only those things that I heard or saw. When I was ten or twelve my father took me to see Irving play Hamlet, and did not understand why I preferred Irving to Ellen Terry, who was, I can now see, the idol of himself and his friends. I could not think of her, as I could of Irving's Hamlet, as but myself, and I was not old enough to care for feminine charm and beauty. For many years Hamlet was an image of heroic self-possession for the poses of youth and childhood to copy, a combatant of the battle within myself. My father had read me the story of the little boy murdered by the Jews in Chaucer and the tale of Sir Topaz, explaining the hard words, and though both excited me, I had liked Sir Topaz best and been disappointed that it left off in the middle. As I grew older, he would tell me plots of Balzac's novels, using incident or character as an illustration for some profound criticism of life. Now that I have read all the Comédie Humaine, certain pages have an unnatural emphasis, straining and overbalancing the outline, and I remember how in some suburban street, he told me of Lucien de Rubempré, or of the duel after the betrayal of his master, and how the wounded Lucien had muttered [...] "so much the worse" [...] when he heard someone say that he was not dead.|$|E

But you may suppose that my {{thoughts}} often move towards you, and that I fancy what you may be doing in the great City,--the greatest on the Earth,--where I spent so many years of my life. I first saw London <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> between <b>eight</b> and nine years old, and then lived in or near it for the whole of the next ten, and more there than anywhere else for seven years longer. Since then I have hardly ever been a year without seeing the place, and have often lived in it for a considerable time. There I grew from childhood to be a man. My little Brothers and Sisters, and since, my Mother, died and are buried there. There I first saw your Mamma, and was there married. It seems as if, in some strange way, London were a part of Me or I of London. I think of it often, not as full of noise and dust and confusion, but as something silent, grand and everlasting.|$|R

I tell thee, Harry Clifford, {{he left me}} at York <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not <b>eight</b> years old, and I have never seen him since. He gave a charge on his lands to a {{goldsmith}} at York to pay for my up-bringing, and I verily believe thought no more of me than if <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> a messan dog. He wedded a lady in Flanders and had a son or twain, but I have never seen them nor my stepdame; and now Gilbert there, who brought {{the letter to the}} Mother Prioress, says she is dead, and the little heir, whose birth makes me nobody, is at a monastery school at Ghent. But my Lord of Redgrave must needs make overtures to my father for me, whether for his son or himself Gilbert cannot say. So my father sends to bring me back for a betrothal. The good Prioress goes with me. She saith that if it be the old Lord, who is a fierce old rogue with as ill a name as Tiptoft himself, the butcher, she will make my Lord St. John know the reason why! But what will he care?' ...|$|R
