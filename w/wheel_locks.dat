5|$|Five sets of sluices and two weirs {{are used}} to control the canal's depth. The sluices, located at Mode <b>Wheel</b> <b>Locks,</b> Barton Locks, Irlam Locks, Latchford Locks and Weaver Sluices, are {{designed}} to allow water entering the canal to flow along its length in a controlled manner. Each consists {{of a set of}} mechanically driven vertical steel roller gates, supported by masonry piers. Originally, manually operated Stoney Sluices were used; these were replaced in the 1950s by electrically driven units, with automation technology introduced from the late 1980s. The sluices are protected against damage from drifting vessels by large concrete barriers. Stop logs can be inserted by roving cranes, installed upstream of each sluice; at Weaver Sluices, accessed by boat, this task is performed by a floating crane.|$|E

500|$|The {{quality of}} water in the ship canal remains {{adversely}} affected by several factors. The high population density of the Mersey Basin has, historically, placed heavy demands on sewage treatment and disposal. Industrial and agricultural discharges into the Irwell, Medlock, and Irk rivers are responsible for a number of industrial contaminants found in the canal. Matters have improved since 1990, when the National Rivers Authority found the area between Trafford Road Bridge and Mode <b>Wheel</b> <b>Locks</b> to be [...] "grossly polluted". The water was depleted of dissolved oxygen, which {{in the latter half of}} the 20th century often resulted in toxic sediments normally present at the bottom of the turning basin in what is now Salford Quays rising to the surface during the summer months, giving the impression of solid ground. [...] Previously, only roach and sticklebacks could be found in the canal's upper levels, and then only during the colder parts of the year, but an oxygenation project implemented at Salford Quays from 2001, together with the gradual reduction of industrial pollutants from the Mersey's tributaries, has encouraged the migration into the canal of fish populations from further upstream. The canal's water quality remains low, with mercury and cadmium in particular present at [...] "extremely high levels". Episodic pollution and a lack of habitat remain problems for wildlife, although in 2005, for the first time in living memory, salmon were observed breeding in the River Goyt (a part of the Mersey's catchment). In 2010 the Environment Agency issued a report concluding that the canal [...] "does not pose a significant barrier to salmon movement or impact on migratory behaviours".|$|E
500|$|The two secondhand vessels [...] {{were joined}} in January 1899 by the newly built Manchester City of 7,696 grt, {{constructed}} by Raylton Dixon & Co of Middlesbrough. This steamship carried [...] of coal, burned at [...] per day, giving {{a speed of}} , fast for her day. [...] She was a refrigerated vessel, designed to carry frozen meat and live cattle, and was claimed {{to be one of}} the largest meat-carrying ships then afloat. She made a successful maiden voyage from Canada and up the new canal to Manchester, taking two days and stopping overnight at Irlam to give the crew a rest. The Manchester Guardian reported on 16 January 1899 that [...] "there were many shakings of the head, not only in Liverpool, at the audacity of the attempt" [...] and that [...] "the canal pilots, on reaching Irlam, looked as if they had not been in bed for a week, as their eyes were bleared with exhaustion". The City discharged 450cattle and 150sheep at Manchester Corporation's Foreign Animals Wharf near the Mode <b>Wheel</b> <b>locks</b> in Salford. With an overall length of , she was by far the largest vessel to have ventured up the waterway, and her successful navigation disproved the claim of Liverpool owners that only ships of [...] or less could safely reach Manchester. The vessel continued to Manchester docks for further unloading, where she was met by the Lord Mayor, accompanied by a band and a festive crowd. This successful voyage did much to encourage other shipowners to use the new port. On her first voyage to Halifax, Nova Scotia in March 1899, the City took nine days and sixteen hours; and arrived before the mail boat, which had left the Mersey twelve hours ahead of her.|$|E

40|$|In {{maturing}} rats, {{the growth}} of abdominal fat is attenuated by voluntary wheel running. After the cessation of running by <b>wheel</b> <b>locking,</b> a rapid increase in adipose tissue growth to a size {{that is similar to}} rats that have never run (i. e. catch-up growth) has been previously reported by our lab. In contrast, diet-induced increases in adiposity have a slower onset with relatively delayed transcriptomic responses. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to identify molecular pathways associated with the rapid increase in adipose tissue after ending 6 wks of voluntary running at the time of puberty. Age-matched, male Wistar rats were given access to running wheels from 4 to 10 weeks of age. From the 10 th to 11 th week of age, one group of rats had continued wheel access, while the other group had one week of <b>wheel</b> <b>locking.</b> Perirenal adipose tissue was extracted, RNA sequencing was performed, and bioinformatics analyses were executed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). IPA was chosen to assist in the understanding of complex 'omics data by integrating data into networks and pathways. <b>Wheel</b> <b>locked</b> rats gained significantly more fat mass and significantly increased body fat percentage between weeks 10 - 11 despite having decreased food intake, as compared to rats with continued wheel access. IPA identified 646 known transcripts differentially expressed (p < 0. 05) between continued wheel access and <b>wheel</b> <b>locking.</b> In <b>wheel</b> <b>locked</b> rats, IPA revealed enrichment of transcripts for the following functions: extracellular matrix, macrophage infiltration, immunity, and pro-inflammatory. These findings suggest that increases in visceral adipose tissue that accompanies the cessation of pubertal physical activity are associated with the alteration of multiple pathways, some of which may potentiate the development of pubertal obesity and obesity-associated systemic low-grade inflammation that occurs later in life...|$|R

Childhood is a critical time of growth, and decisions made during this time lead to positive and negative health consequences, specifically pertaining to adiposity. There is convincing evidence that children who are overweight and obese are at higher risk for adult obesity and risk factors associated with obesity for their whole life course. Puberty is a critical time of adipose tissue expansion, and it is accepted by most that this is the age where the number of adipocytes is set for adulthood. Further it is believed that before puberty, adipose tissue expands by hyperplasia, while after puberty, adipose tissue expands by hypertrophy. The time leading up to puberty represents a critical time. Yet, {{little is known about the}} interaction between age, physical activity, and adipose tissue expansion in young, growing animals. Thus, I employed a unique model of childhood obesity to test whether: 1) seven days of decreased physical activity (<b>wheel</b> <b>lock)</b> in 49 - 56 day old rats and 70 - 77 day old rats would result in gains in visceral adipose mass seen in age-matched sedentary rats concurrent with an increase in adipocyte size and inflammatory mRNA expression (Chapter 2), and 2) glucocorticoid block would attenuate the visceral adipose depot gains seen with <b>wheel</b> <b>lock</b> in rats at sexual maturity (Chapter 3). Here, I present evidence that the age at which <b>wheel</b> <b>lock</b> occurs influences visceral adipose tissue growth and propose a mechanism for this growth at two ages of pre-pubertal growth (49 - 56 days of age and 70 - 77 days of age). Specifically, rats that undergo <b>wheel</b> <b>lock</b> for 7 days at 49 - 56 days of age show no differences in total body mass, mean adipocyte diameter, or mass of omental, epididymal, and perirenal adipose tissue depots compared to rats that remained physically active. However, rats that undergo <b>wheel</b> <b>lock</b> for 7 days at 70 - 77 days of age have an increased rate of body mass, fat mass, and % body fat gained and have increased depot mass and total number of adipocytes in epididymal and perirenal adipose tissue,...|$|R
