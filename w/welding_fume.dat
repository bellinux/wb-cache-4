40|$|Welding is an {{important}} and widely used process in the manufacturing and maintenance of various works involving metals and alloys. While welding has broad applications, the <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> generated during the process has impacts on workers’ health, which needs to be addressed. One of the major steps that can be undertaken {{to take care of}} this issue is the use of ventilation, which requires knowledge of characteristics and dispersion of the <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> in the workers’ breathing zone. It is difficult to assess <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> dispersion from manual measurement due to numerous welding processes and sufficient data requirement. Numerical prediction of <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> is dubious due to several errors. This paper considers the use of numerically predicted CO 2 concentrations to indirectly predict <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> distribution in workshops. This is based on the assumption that if the particles are sufficiently small size, they follow the diffusion pattern of gases. Experiments are carried out in a room with an opening and a <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> generation system for measurement of CO 2 and fume diffusion. The results show high possibility of predicting <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> concentration based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulated CO 2 concentration with a correlation coefficient of 0. 74...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to characterize personal exposures to welding-related metals and gases for production welders and non-welders in a large manufacturing facility. <b>Welding</b> <b>fume</b> metals and irritant gases nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and ozone (O 3) were sampled for thirty-eight workers.

40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Welding</b> <b>fume</b> {{contains}} ele-ments that, {{in their}} pure forms, can be haz-ardous to worker health if inhaled or ingested. Therefore, the chemical compo-sition of <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> must be examined when considering fume toxicity.

40|$|International audienceWe {{investigated}} {{relationships between}} occupational exposure to gas and arc <b>welding</b> <b>fumes</b> {{and the risk}} of lung cancer among workers exposed to these agents throughout the spectrum of industries. Two population-based case-control studies were conducted in Montreal. Study I (1979 - 1986) included 857 cases and 1066 controls, and Study II (1996 - 2001) comprised 736 cases and 894 controls. Detailed job histories were obtained by interview and evaluated by an expert team of chemist-hygienists to estimate degree of exposure to approximately 300 substances for each job. Gas and arc <b>welding</b> <b>fumes</b> were among the agents evaluated. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) of lung cancer using logistic regression, adjusting for smoking history and other covariates. The two studies provided similar results, so a pooled analysis was conducted. Among all subjects, no significant association was found between lung cancer and gas <b>welding</b> <b>fumes</b> (OR = 1. 1; 95 % CI = 0. 9 - 1. 4) or arc <b>welding</b> <b>fumes</b> (OR = 1. 0; 95 % CI = 0. 8 - 1. 2). However, when restricting attention to light smokers, there was an increased risk of lung cancer in relation to gas <b>welding</b> <b>fumes</b> (OR = 2. 9; 95 % CI = 1. 7 - 4. 8) and arc <b>welding</b> <b>fumes</b> (OR = 2. 3; 95 % CI = 1. 3 - 3. 8), with even higher OR estimates among workers with the highest cumulative exposures.

40|$|<b>Welding</b> <b>fumes</b> are {{a complex}} mixture {{composed}} of different metals. Most <b>welding</b> <b>fumes</b> contain {{a small percentage}} of manganese. There is an emerging concern among occupational health officials about the potential neurological effects associated with the exposure to manganese in <b>welding</b> <b>fumes.</b> Little is known about the fate of manganese that is complexed with other metals in the welding particles after inhalation. Depending on the welding process and the composition of the welding electrode, manganese may be present in different oxidation states and have different solubility properties. These differences may affect the biological responses to manganese after the inhalation of <b>welding</b> <b>fumes.</b> Manganese intoxication and the associated neurological symptoms have been reported in individual cases of welders who have been exposed to high concentrations of manganese-containing <b>welding</b> <b>fumes</b> due to work in poorly ventilated areas. However, the question remains as to whether welders who are exposed to low levels of <b>welding</b> <b>fumes</b> {{over long periods of time}} are at risk for the development of neurological diseases. For the most part, questions remain unanswered. There is still paucity of adequate scientific reports on welders who suffered significant neurotoxicity, hence there is a need for well-designed epidemiology studies that combine complete information on the occupational exposure of welders with both behavioral and biochemical endpoints of neurotoxicity...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{emphasizes}} the need for occupational hygiene professionals to require evidence {{of the quality of}} <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> data from analytical laboratories. The measurement of metals in <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> using atomic spectrometric techniques is a complex analysis often requiring spe-cialist digestion procedures. The results from a trial programme testing the proficiency of lab-oratories in the Workplace Analysis Scheme for Proficiency (WASP) to measure potentially harmful metals in several different types of <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> showed that most laboratories under-estimated the mass of analyte on the filters. The average recovery was 70 – 80 % of the target value and> 20 % of reported recoveries for some of the more difficult <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> matrices were < 50 %. This level of under-reporting has significant implications for any health or hygiene studies of the exposure of welders to toxic metals for the types of fumes included in this study. Good laboratories ’ performance measuring spiked WASP filter samples containing soluble metal salts did not guarantee good performance when measuring the more complex <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> trial filter samples. Consistent rather than erratic error predominated, suggesting that the main analytical factor contributing to the differences between the target values and results was the effectiveness of the sample preparation procedures used by participating laboratories.

Data suggests that welders are immune compromised. Given the inability of pulmonary leukocytes to properly respond to a secondary infection in animal models, the question arose whether the dysfunction persisted systemically. Our aim was to evaluate the circulating leukocyte population in terms of cellular activation, presence of oxidative stress, and functionality after a secondary challenge, following <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> exposure. Rats were intratracheally instilled (ITI) with PBS or 2 mg of <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> collected from a stainless steel weld.

In addition, mononuclear cells were isolated 24 h post-exposure to measure oxidative stress by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. <b>Welding</b> <b>fume</b> exposure had rapid effects on the circulating leukocyte population as identified by relative mRNA expression changes. Instillation of <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> reduced inflammatory protein production of circulating leukocytes when challenged with the secondary stimulus LPS.

40|$|Welding is {{a common}} {{industrial}} process used to join metals and generates complex aerosols of potentially hazardous metal fumes and gases. Most long-time welders experience some type of respiratory disorder during their time of employment. The use of animal models {{and the ability to}} control the <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> exposure in toxicology studies have been helpful in developing {{a better understanding of how}} welding fumes affect health. There are no studies that have performed a side-by-side comparison of the pulmonary responses from an animal toxicology <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> study with the lung responses associated with chronic exposure to <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> by a career welder. In this study, post-mortem lung tissue was donated from a long-time welder with a well-characterized work background and a history of extensive <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> exposure. To simulate a long-term welding exposure in an animal model, Sprague-Dawley rats were treated once a week for 28 weeks by intratracheal instillation with 2 mg of a stainless steel, hard-surfacing <b>welding</b> <b>fume.</b> Lung tissues from the welder and the welding fume-treated rats were examined by light and electron microscopy. Pathological analysis of lung tissue collected from the welder demonstrated inflammatory cell influx and significant pulmonary injury. The poor and deteriorating lung condition observed in the welder examined in this study was likely due to exposure to very high levels of potentially toxic metal fumes and gases for a significant number of years due to work in confined spaces. The lung toxicity profile for the rats treated with <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> was similar. For tissue samples from both the welder and treated rats, welding particle accumulations deposited and persisted in lung structures and were easily visualized using light microscopic techniques. Agglomerates of deposited welding particles mostly were observed within lung cells, particularly alveolar macrophages. Analysis of individual particles within the agglomerates showed that these particles were metal complexes with iron, chromium, and nickel being the most common metals present. In conclusion, long-term exposure to specific <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> can lead to serious chronic lung disease characterized by significant particle deposition and persistence as demonstrated in both a human case study and rat model. Not only were the lung responses similar in the human and rat lungs, as evidenced by inflammatory cell influx and pulmonary disease, but the composition of individual welding particles and agglomerations in situ was comparable.

Markers of pulmonary inflammation were measured in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and nuclear translocation of transcription factor was assessed in BAL cells by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Instillation of either whole or soluble fractions of <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> caused a significant influx of inflammatory cells and other markers of inflammation in the BALF 24 h later. MIP- 2 protein in BALF and nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and AP- 1 were significantly greater following instillation of whole and soluble fractions than in saline-instilled lungs. Chelation of the soluble fraction, to remove transition metals, abolished the ability to cause inflammation, MIP- 2 increase or transcription factor translocation to the nucleus. Instillation of washed particulates alone caused no significant change in any end-point compared to saline.

The study comprised three phases; in the first one, welders’ exposure to <b>welding</b> <b>fumes</b> was assessed {{at the beginning of the}} study. After that, a local exhaust ventilation system was designed and installed in the aforementioned repair shop. In the final stage, welders’ exposure to <b>welding</b> <b>fumes</b> was assessed again after installation of the ventilation system. The procedure recommended by NIOSH (method number 7300) was used for individual sampling of welders. 			Results: Based on the obtained findings, before installing the ventilation system, welding technicians were exposed to 0. 3 mg/m 3 of copper fumes and 0. 04 mg/m 3 of chromium fumes. Journeyman welders were also exposed to 2. 16 mg/m 3 of manganese fumes, while stellar welders were exposed to 6. 9 mg/m 3 of iron fumes. In the light of these measurements, a local exhaust ventilation system was designed and installed. Subsequently, measurement of exposure to <b>welding</b> <b>fumes</b> showed a significant reduction. That is, welding technicians were exposed to 0. 17 mg/m 3 and 0. 015 mg/m 3 of copper and chromium fumes respectively.

In the actual sampling (n= 32), the results of the questionnaires show that all the customer requirements (irritant effect, sensitiser effects, respiratory system effect, systemic toxin effect, reproductive toxins effect, carcinogen effect, mixture effect) were equally important to the welders. The relationship between the customer (welder) requirement and technical characteristic were established whereby important technical characteristics were shortlisted (personal sampling 23. 0 %, multi chemical analysis 20. 8 %, exposure limit 19. 7 %, health questionnaire 17. 6 % and lung function test 14. 7 %). Development of <b>welding</b> <b>fumes</b> indices according to employees demand will increase the knowledge and awareness on occupational safety and health among employees (welders) ...|$|R
40|$|Nail tissue {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a biomarker for body burden of occupational exposure to manganese from welding fumes. Though {{recent studies have shown}} correlation between manganese exposure and both nail tissue concentration as well as concentrations in dopaminergic regions of the brain, concerns of the validity of nail tissue as a biomarker have arisen due to the potential for exogenous contamination of Mn to undermine the quantization of endogenous Mn in nail. Previous studies have used a cleaning method of 1 % Triton X- 100 surfactant plus sonication in order to attempt to remove exogenous <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> contamination. Determination of the potential level of exogenous Mn from <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> on welder nail tissue was investigated. In addition, an intentional <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> contamination methodology was developed in order to deposit <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> Mn onto control nail samples in a within-subject design in order to test the efficacy of the prior nail tissue cleaning method. Paired sample fingernails from welders exposed to gas metal arc welding (GMAW) <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> were digested and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Uncleaned welder fingernails had a mean of 8. 78 µg/g Mn (LCL = 5. 58, UCL = 11. 99) while those cleaned via the prior cleaning method showed a mean of 3. 22 µg/g Mn (LCL = 3. 07, UCL = 3. 37). Results of a Cochran method two-sample t-test between cleaned and uncleaned welder fingernails showed significance at p= 0. 0117 and a Wilcoxon t-distribution 2 -sided test approached significance at p= 0. 0671, indicating that exogenous Mn contamination is likely a threat to validity of nail tissue as a biomarker of body burden. GMAW <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> exposed uncleaned control subject nails (at twice the level of exogenous Mn seen in the welder fingernails) had a mean concentration of 11. 35 µg/g Mn (LCL 95 = 9. 41, UCL 95 = 13. 30) while unexposed uncleaned control nails had a mean concentration of 0. 42 µg/g Mn (LCL 95 = 0. 23, UCL 95 = 0. 60). Results of a Cochran method two-sample t-test between exposed and unexposed uncleaned control fingernails showed significance at p= 0. 0001 and a Wilcoxon t-distribution 2 -sided test approached significance at p= 0. 0172, indicating that the method of GMAW <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> contamination effectively contaminated the tissue with <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> Mn. Exposed cleaned control fingernails had a mean of 0. 63 µg/g Mn (LCL 95 = 0. 48, UCL 95 = 0. 79), while those unexposed prior to cleaning showed a mean of 0. 14 µg/g Mn (LCL 95 = 0. 12, UCL 95 = 0. 17). Results of a Cochran method two-sample t-test between exposed and unexposed cleaned control nails showed significance at p= 0. 0002 and a Wilcoxon t-distribution 2 -sided test approached significance at p= 0. 00027, indicating that while not all exogenous Mn contamination was eliminated by the cleaning method,, the residual contamination amounted to only 4. 45 % ± 1. 23 % (95. 55 % of the contamination was removed). The results indicate that nail tissue can be cleaned effectively of the majority of exogenous Mn exposure, pointing to the utility of nail tissue as a biomarker for <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> Mn internal exposure and likely occupational and environmental exposures to additional metals as well. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{developing}} countries, {{the informal}} sector, particularly small-scale welding activities, {{are considered to}} be an important contributor to urban air pollution although studies in this sector are limited. This study aims to identify the composition of small-scale <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> in order to further investigate the effects and set control strategies and urban pollution abatement policies. Breathing zone air samples were collected from 30 mild steel manual metal arc welders and 17 non-welders in Bandung City, West Java, Indonesia. The respirable particulates in air samples were analyzed using gravimetric method, and Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) was employed to identify characteristic of <b>welding</b> <b>fume.</b> It was found that respirable particulates concentration in welders (range : 315. 6 and 3, 735. 93 µgm- 3; average 1, 545. 436 µgm- 3) were significantly higher than in non-welders (range : 41. 84 and 1, 688. 03 µgm- 3; average : 375. 783 µgm- 3). Welders 2 ̆ 7 breathing zones contain Fe>Na>K>Mn>Al >Cr>Ti>Cl>Br>I>Zn>Sb>V>Co>Sc; while non-welders 2 ̆ 7 breathing zones contain Cr>F>Al>Ti>Na>Br>I>Mn>Cl>Co>Zn>Sc. Inter-species correlation analysis conducted using Statgraphic Ver. 4. 0 shows that Fe (range : n. d. – 775. 19 µgm- 3; average: 0. 1674 µgm- 3), Co (range : n. d. – 0. 51 µgm- 3; average: 0. 000082 µgm- 3), Mn (range : 0. 39 – 148. 37 µgm- 3; average: 0. 0374 µgm- 3), Na (range: 0. 17 and 623. 85 µgm- 3; average: 0. 0973 µgm- 3) and K (range : n. d. – 301. 15 µgm- 3; average: 0. 0535 µgm- 3) were emitted from welding activity, and thus are considered as components of <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> which contribute to urban air pollution. Although <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> and the identified species in <b>welding</b> <b>fume</b> were still below permissible limit, small-scale welding activities have great potential in emitting higher fume concentration due to due to high variability of welding activities, such as welding frequency, materials being welded, and varied environmental conditions.

40|$|Studies have {{indicated}} that pulmonary exposure to <b>welding</b> <b>fumes</b> can induce a series of adverse effects in the respiratory system, including infection, bronchitis, siderosis and decreased pulmonary function. Recent clinical and epidemiological {{studies have found that}} pulmonary exposure to <b>welding</b> <b>fumes</b> is also associated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular events. However, there is insufficient evidence to confirm a direct effect of <b>welding</b> <b>fumes</b> on the cardiovascular system. The present study investigated the effects of pulmonary exposure to <b>welding</b> <b>fumes</b> on the heart and the vascular system in rats. Two chemically distinct <b>welding</b> <b>fumes</b> generated from manual metal arc-hard surfacing (MMA-HS) and gas metal arc-mild steel (GMA-MS) welding were tested. Three groups of rats were instilled intratracheally with MMA-HS (222 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 030 mg/rat), GMA-MS (222 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 030 mg/rat) or saline as control once a week for seven weeks. On days 1 and 7 after the last treatment, basal cardiovascular function and the cardiovascular response to increasing doses of adrenoreceptor agonists were assessed. MMA-HS treatment reduced the basal levels of left ventricle end-systolic pressure and dP/dt(max) at 1 day post-treatment, and decreased dP/dt(min) in response to isoproterenol (ISO) at 7 days post-treatment. Unlike MMA-HS, GMA-MS only affected left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in response to ISO at 7 days post-treatment. Treatment with MMA-HS or GMA-MS did not alter heart rate and blood pressure. Our findings suggest that exposure to different <b>welding</b> <b>fumes</b> can induce different adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, and that cardiac contractility may be a sensitive indicator of cardiovascular dysfunction.
