25|$|I brought {{controls}} to the Tour {{in the wake}} of Tom Simpson's death in 1967 – and the riders went on strike. After the discoveries made , I feel real resentment towards the medical and scientific powers who deceived us for 30 years. The controls are almost always negative, which means that the labs have been making serious mistakes, mistakes that have only served to speed up the growth of this evil. The controls <b>we</b> <b>developed</b> after Simpson's death were a lie, covered up by the highest scientific and medical authorities, and I condemn them.|$|E
