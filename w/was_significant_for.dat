5|$|The {{match between}} Hart and Doink <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>for</b> {{a couple of}} reasons. It marked Doink's final match as a heel, as he turned on Jerry Lawler shortly after the match. In addition, Matt Osborne, who had portrayed Doink since the character's creation, was fired that fall because of drug problems.|$|E
5|$|The final {{was held}} at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, which was Roma's home ground. UEFA decided that the match would still be played at the stadium, despite it being Roma's home ground. Therefore, the match was {{effectively}} a home match for them. The stadium <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>for</b> Liverpool as well, as their victory in 1977 came at the ground. With home advantage Roma went into the match as favourites, and were 13–8 with bookmakers to win the match.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{communications}} between the Earth and spacecraft are not instantaneous. There {{is a brief}} delay from the source to the receiver, which becomes more noticeable as distances increase. This delay <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>for</b> {{communications between}} ground control and Apollo 8 when it became the first manned spacecraft to orbit the Moon: for every question, the ground control station had to wait at least threeseconds for the answer to arrive. The communications delay between Earth and Mars can vary between five and twenty minutes depending upon the relative positions of the two planets. As a consequence of this, if a robot {{on the surface of}} Mars were to encounter a problem, its human controllers would not be aware of it until at least five minutes later, and possibly up to twenty minutes later; it would then take a further five to twenty minutes for instructions to travel from Earth to Mars.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Albulena <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>for</b> the {{southern}} resistance against the Ottoman Empire. Franz Babinger, a {{historian of the}} Ottoman Empire, describes the battle as Skanderbeg's most brilliant victory. The battle of Albulena strengthened the morale of Skanderbeg's men who afterwards rarely, if at all, deserted his army as Hamza had. Hamza himself was sent as a prisoner to Naples in Alfonso's realm after being captured. An Ottoman envoy was sent to ransom the standard bearers and forty of the distinguished prisoners. The envoy also tried {{to settle for a}} truce between Mehmed and Skanderbeg, but the latter responded that he would only accept if Svetigrad and Berat, which had been lost in 1448 and 1450 respectively, were restored to his state. Seeing that Mehmed would not accept such terms, Skanderbeg strengthened his garrisons in the area around Svetigrad. The victory still bought Albania and Italy time; in 1460, Mehmed and Skanderbeg signed an armistice that lasted three years. This gave Skanderbeg the opportunity to land in Italy and help out Alfonso's son, Ferdinand I of Naples, who had been crowned after his father had died. The battle thus opened a new phase in the Ottoman-Albanian war which saw the high-water mark of the Albanian resistance and the fiercest Ottoman invasions of Albania in the war. The war would last until the fall of Krujë in 1478.|$|E
5|$|The year 1877 <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>for</b> Fauré, both professionally and personally. In January {{his first}} violin sonata was {{performed}} at a Société Nationale concert with great success, marking a turning-point in his composing {{career at the}} age of 31. Nectoux counts the work as the composer's first great masterpiece. In March, Saint-Saëns retired from the Madeleine, succeeded as organist by Théodore Dubois, his choirmaster; Fauré was appointed to take over from Dubois. In July Fauré became engaged to Pauline Viardot's daughter Marianne, with whom he was deeply in love. To his great sorrow, she broke off the engagement in November 1877, for reasons that are not clear. To distract Fauré, Saint-Saëns took him to Weimar and introduced him to Franz Liszt. This visit gave Fauré a liking for foreign travel, which he indulged {{for the rest of his}} life. From 1878, he and Messager made trips abroad to see Wagner operas. They saw Das Rheingold and Die Walküre at the Cologne Opera; the complete Ring cycle at the Hofoper in Munich and at Her Majesty's Theatre in London; and Die Meistersinger in Munich and at Bayreuth, where they also saw Parsifal. They frequently performed as a party piece their joint composition, the irreverent Souvenirs de Bayreuth. This short, up-tempo piano work for four hands sends up themes from The Ring. Fauré admired Wagner and had a detailed knowledge of his music, but he was one of the few composers of his generation not to come under Wagner's musical influence.|$|E

25|$|The {{adoption}} of the RMA <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>for</b> three reasons. Firstly, the RMA established one integrated framework that replaced the many previous resource-use regimes, which had been fragmented between agencies and sectors, such as land use, forestry, pollution, traffic, zoning, water and air.|$|E
25|$|The 1955–56 season <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>for</b> many reasons; firstly, {{two of the}} club's {{greatest}} servants, captain Harry Johnston and Stan Mortensen, both departed to face new challenges. Johnston became {{manager of}} Reading, while Morty went to Hull City. Their places were filled by Roy Gratrix and Jackie Mudie, who switched to centre-forward, allowing Dave Durie {{to take over the}} inside-left position.|$|E
25|$|German {{control of}} the lake <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>for</b> the whole {{campaign}} in the central African theatre. While the British could muster troops {{to the south of}} the lake, and the Belgians had troops to the north, neither could push into German East Africa because of the risk that the Germans would use their boats to transport troops across the lake, and use them to cut their supply and communications lines.|$|E

25|$|The {{connection}} between Northrop and Davis <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>for</b> Northrop's career. Permanently disabled, Northrop {{could no longer}} perform field duties for the United States Army. In January 1848, he was dropped from the army rolls, retiring to civilian life in Charleston and Anne Arundel County, Maryland. However, when Davis was appointed Secretary of War in 1853, the new Cabinet secretary took steps to recall his friend to the Army. The limping Northrop was promoted {{to the rank of}} captain.|$|E
25|$|Women’s first strides were in education: in 1928, {{they were}} {{provided}} with financial support to study abroad; in 1935 they were admitted to Tehran University, and in 1944 education became compulsory. In 1932, the second Congress of Women of the East was organized in Tehran, and Iranian women activists met with activists from Lebanon, Egypt, India and Iraq. Dowlatabadi was the secretary. In 1936, Reza Shah Pahlavi set the mandatory unveiling of women—a highly controversial policy which nonetheless <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>for</b> the desegregation of women.|$|E
25|$|Both sides {{employed}} late 19th-century military technology, such as breech-loading {{rifles and}} cannons, remote-controlled land mines, armor-piercing shells, naval torpedoes, torpedo boats, and purpose-built landing craft. The {{second generation of}} ironclads (i.e. designed after the Battle of Hampton Roads) were employed in battle for the first time. That <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>for</b> a conflict where no major power was involved, and attracted British, French, and U.S. observers. During the war, Peru developed the Toro Submarino ("Submarine Bull"). She never saw action, and was scuttled at the end to prevent her capture.|$|E
50|$|Tara House <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>for</b> its {{architectural}} quality, {{in particular}} the fine design, detailing, materials and workmanship of the interior, which {{were part of the}} 1927-28 renovations. Tara House {{is an example of a}} facade by Richard Gailey, who designed many city buildings in Brisbane in the 1880s, and <b>is</b> <b>significant</b> <b>for</b> its association with the Irish community in Brisbane and the Queensland Irish Association. It <b>is</b> also <b>significant</b> <b>for</b> its contribution to the streetscape in association with the adjoining Heckelmann's Building.|$|R

25|$|Age {{of these}} units <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>for</b> several reasons. All of the Phase I units were either built or under {{construction}} when the Clean Air Act of 1977 was enacted, {{and all but}} eight were built or under construction when the 1970 Act was enacted. Consequently, these units were built when labor costs were significantly less than in the 1990s, and they avoided major investments in pollution control equipment. In the 1990s, these units were often among the least expensive of any operated by their respective owners, in terms of cost per megawatt-hour of energy produced. Compared to other plants on a utility company system, these units provided incentives for their owners to maximize operating time, minimize downtime for repairs or retrofit, and minimize further capital investments in them.|$|E
25|$|In 1870, {{police in}} Newcastle upon Tyne were {{recorded}} as 'in dispute' with their local Watch Committee over conditions {{of work and}} low pay, though they did not withdraw from duty. Two years later in 1872, 179 men of the Metropolitan Police refused to report for duty. They were protesting the poor conditions of their service and low pay, as had the police in Newcastle upon Tyne. The police {{were back on the}} beat within hours. Of the 179 men who refused duty, 69 were dismissed from the force. The rest were allowed back on duty after having had apologised for their conduct. They gained improvements in pay and conditions. This action <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>for</b> establishing a precedent for collective action by police in order to improve working conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the neon light also <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>for</b> the last key element of the fluorescent lamp, its fluorescent coating. In 1926 Jacques Risler received a French patent {{for the application of}} fluorescent coatings to neon light tubes. The main use of these lamps, which can be considered the first commercially successful fluorescents, was for advertising, not general illumination. This, however, was not the first use of fluorescent coatings; Becquerel had earlier used the idea and Edison used calcium tungstate for his unsuccessful lamp. Other efforts had been mounted, but all were plagued by low efficiency and various technical problems. Of particular importance was the invention in 1927 of a low-voltage “metal vapor lamp” by Friedrich Meyer, Hans-Joachim Spanner, and Edmund Germer, who were employees of a German firm in Berlin. A German patent was granted but the lamp never went into commercial production.|$|E

25|$|The South African cricket team toured Australia for {{the first}} time in 1910-11. The Australian team was then {{considered}} as the leading cricket team of the era, in what has been described as 'The Golden Age of Australian Cricket'. Led by the legendary Clem Hill and the batting exploits of Victor Trumper, Australia won the 5-match Test series comfortably 4-1, though South Africa made history by recording their first ever overseas Test victory, as well as a maiden Test victory against Australia at the 3rd Test in Adelaide Oval. The tour <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>for</b> the rise of Billy Zulch as a leading batsman of the South African cricket team; and after a resolute 150 in the 1st Test at Sydney Cricket Ground in a heavy innings defeat for South Africa, he scored South Africa's highest individual score of 105 in their maiden overseas Test win at Adelaide, a match also characterized by the all-round performances Charlie Llewellyn and the outstanding bowling of Reggie Schwarz.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} archaeological {{features}} visible within the woods, including medieval wood banks, small quarry pits, signs of Roman industrial use and a Roman dwelling place. The first archaeological excavations {{were carried out}} by Edmund Tyrell Artis (1789–1847), the Steward of the nearby FitzWilliam estate, {{in the first half}} of the 19th century. He suggested a Roman villa site, and the presence of iron working and furnaces within the wood, and in 1965 the Peterborough Museum Society found and excavated furnaces within the woods. Little was then investigated until the 2011 series of archaeological television programme Time Team, which included a LIDAR survey and an archaeological dig within these woods. They confirmed that iron extraction from pits within the woodland, Roman iron smelting sites, and other evidence of Roman industry implied an industrial centre that <b>was</b> <b>significant</b> <b>for</b> Roman British iron supplies. A Roman bath-house, with surviving painted wall plaster may indicate an overseer's residence.|$|E
