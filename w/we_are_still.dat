Therefore, the illumination must be coming from the stars so we can see them as soon as we open our eyes.|$|E

On 19 September, Benfica travelled to Coimbra to face Académica, beating them 1–0 with a goal from Simão to reach the top of the league table. Trapattoni praised his team and said leading is important to their mentality: [...] "I am happy with the win, but also with the character they have shown. I had the opportunity to lead in Italy and Germany and it is very important. The team starts to believe in themselves more and more." [...] A week later, Benfica hosted Braga. Despite playing with two players upfront, Benfica was unable to score, splitting points with them. After the game, Trapattoni acknowledged the difficult game his team had played, saying, [...] "The final score could disappoint the fans, but let's not forget <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> leaders. Our opponent was a very dangerous team. We had three good chances in the first half, but could not score." [...] On 30 September, Benfica closed the month by hosting Banská Bystrica.

500|$|In July, Clark held {{another set}} of congressional {{hearings}} on the issue, attracting widespread media coverage. The hearings were tense with Clark, Kennedy, Javits, and testifying medical observers frequently clashing with Mississippi Senators John Stennis and James Eastland (both staunch segregationists), and Mississippi Board of Health officer A. L. Gray. Kennedy called child psychologist Robert Coles to testify on poverty's effect on children in the Mississippi Delta. One North Carolina doctor described [...] "an unwritten policy {{on the part of}} those who control the State to eliminate the Negro Mississippian either by driving him out of the State or starving him to death." [...] When Stennis and Eastland accused the doctor of committing libel against the welfare workers of their state, he invited them and other state officials to go see conditions for themselves, to which none accepted. On the second day of proceedings Secretary Freeman and Senator Javits got into a shouting match, with the senator arguing that the secretary should disregard local authorities' opinions, declare an emergency, and immediately supply food to the region. He remarked, [...] "We seem to be able to send airplanes to the Congo in a terrible hurry. We first heard of the desperation point of poor Mississippi Negroes 18 months agoand <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> hearing that there is starvation in Mississippi." [...] Kennedy openly expressed his frustration with Johnson administration officials' perceived inability to understand the extent of the Delta's problems and other bureaucratic complications, saying, [...] "It seems to me we are floundering around a great deal." ...|$|E
500|$|Following Victoria Climbié's death, the {{agencies}} in the case, {{as well as the}} child services system in general, were widely criticised. Milburn said, [...] "this was not a failing on the part of one service, it was a failing on the part of every service". Fox said Climbié's case amounted to [...] "a shocking tale of individual professional failure and systemic incompetence". Burstow said, [...] "there is a terrible sense of déjà vu in the Laming Report. The same weaknesses have led to the same mistakes, with the same missed opportunities to save a tortured child's life". Labour Party Member of Parliament Karen Buck said, [...] "the Bayswater families unit told me that there must be hundreds of other Climbié cases waiting to happen", and [...] "the Victoria Climbié inquiry highlighted how easy it is for vulnerable families to fall through the net, especially if they do not have English as a first language and are highly mobile". The 1999 Department of Health document, Working Together to Safeguard Children (now superseded), set out child protection guidance to doctors, nurses, and midwives. The Royal College of Nursing, however, said that there was evidence that many nurses did not receive proper training in these areas. Denise Platt, chief inspector of the social services inspectorate (SSI), said doctors, police officers and teachers often thought their only responsibility was to help social services, forgetting that they had a distinct role to play. Mike Leadbetter, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, said that many health professionals were [...] "not engaged in child protection". After the inquiry, there was a feeling that senior managers had managed to escape responsibility and that only junior staff members were punished. Burstow said, [...] "the majority of children who die from abuse or neglect in this country know the perpetrator; it is within the family and by 'friends' that most abuse occurs. As a society <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> in denial about that hard truth".|$|E
500|$|The {{bombing was}} {{condemned}} by British Prime Minister John Major and his government, by the opposition, and by {{individual members of}} parliament (MPs) as a [...] "sickening", [...] "callous" [...] and [...] "barbaric" [...] terrorist attack. Early on, Major stated that, [...] "This explosion looks like {{the work of the}} IRA. It is the work of a few fanatics and... causes absolute revulsion in Ireland as it does here". Sinn Féin was criticised by Taoiseach John Bruton for being [...] "struck mute" [...] on the attack in the immediate aftermath. Bruton described the bombing as [...] "a {{slap in the face to}} people who've been trying, against perhaps their better instincts, to give Sinn Féin a chance to show that they could persuade the IRA to reinstate the ceasefire". [...] The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, stated he was [...] "deeply outraged by the bomb explosion" [...] and joined Bruton and Major in [...] "utterly condemning this brutal and cowardly act of terrorism". Sinn Féin President, Gerry Adams, stated that he was [...] "shocked and saddened" [...] by the bombing. He insisted that his party was committed to achieving a peace settlement and argued [...] "it is sheer folly to return to the old agenda of excluding Sinn Féin and seeking to isolate republicans". On 20 June 1996, the IRA claimed responsibility for the bombing, and stated that it [...] "sincerely regretted" [...] causing injury to civilians. The IRA statement continued:The British Government has spent the last 22 months since August '94 trying to force the surrender of IRA weapons and the defeat of the republican struggle. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> prepared to enhance the democratic peace process [...] but if there is to be a lasting peace [...] then the British Government must put the democratic rights of all of the people of Ireland before its own party political self interest.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, former [...] "good-girl" [...] Cassie {{becomes a}} rebellious teenager; Nick and Sharon have a {{difficult}} time dealing with her. Cassie has a crush on bad-boy Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei), who is dating Lily Winters (Christel Khalil). One night, against her parents' wishes she sneaks out to a party. In a ploy to impress a drunken Daniel she attempts to drive him home, despite being underage. The car crashes, leaving them with no memory of the accident. Daniel is thought to have been driving, and is blamed for the accident. A weakened Cassie escapes from the hospital to find Daniel and tell him she was driving; she is returned to the hospital. During the episode dated May 24, Cassie dies with Nick and Sharon at her side. Grimes said she did not think Cassie would die, but if it was [...] "meant to happen, it's meant to happen". The actress found filming her last scenes with Case and Morrow [...] "ridiculously hard". Daniel is cleared of all charges and Nick and Sharon begin Cassie's Foundation, a movement to prevent teenage drinking and driving. Following her death, the strong relationship between Nick and Sharon changes forever. Weighing in on the [...] "groundbreaking" [...] and [...] "shocking" [...] plot, Morrow stated, [...] "As a person who watched Camryn grow up, I was devastated and it was not that difficult to use those feelings in the scenes we had to play. But as an actor, I have to commend our producer and writers at that time because it gave the show a huge new storyline that years later <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> playing out". He felt that losing a child gave Nick [...] "an edge and a change" [...] that affected him deeply. In 2012, during a court battle over Newman Enterprises (the family company), Nick tells a judge that Sharon's mental problems date to Cassie's death. Luke Kerr of Zap2it referred to this as playing the [...] "Cassie card".|$|E
