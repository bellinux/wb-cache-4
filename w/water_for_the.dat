5|$|In recent years, a {{combination}} of drought and regulatory decisions passed based on the Endangered Species Act of 1973 have forced Reclamation to turn off much of the <b>water</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{west side of the}} San Joaquin Valley {{in order to protect the}} fragile ecosystem in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and keep alive the dwindling fish populations of Central Valley rivers.|$|E

Steam-powered generators provided electric power for radios, navigation equipment, refrigeration compressors, pumps, lighting, and degaussing. An evaporator produced fresh <b>water</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> boilers and for the crew.|$|E
5|$|A leat {{from this}} stretch was created at {{around the time}} of the {{construction}} of the canal to provide <b>water</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Twyford Mead water meadows. Farming of the water meadows continued until around 1930, after the closure of the navigation itself. It was a labour-intensive method of land management, but the controlled flooding of the meadows, with the deposition of silt from the water, enabled the land to produce two crops of hay per year, as well as grazing for sheep and cattle. Demonstrations of the techniques used to flood the meadows are still carried out occasionally.|$|E
5|$|Boating on {{the canal}} is encouraged, {{although}} {{the lack of}} a link to the River Parrett at Bridgwater is restrictive. At this point, the Parrett is a salt water river, and is laden with silt, whereas the canal contains fresh water. Not only is there a risk of silt entering the canal, but the salt water cannot be allowed to contaminate the fresh, as the canal is still used for the transport of drinking <b>water</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> population of Bridgwater. The canal forms part of the local flood relief system, in winter taking water from the River Tone at Taunton and discharging it into the Parrett at a sluice in the western fringe of Bridgwater, near the Bridgwater Canalside Centre.|$|E

5|$|By {{four days}} after landfall, FEMA served around 68,000 meals to {{displaced}} families. More than a dozen disaster recovery centers were initiated throughout the state. FEMA provided 125,000 pounds of ice {{in the first few}} days, and prepared 200,000 pounds of ice and 180,000liters of <b>water</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> following week for the remaining communities without water. By six days after Isabel struck the state, all hospitals were opened and all roads excluding North Carolina Highway 12 were passable due to emergency crews clearing roads with debris. By about one month after the hurricane struck, 32,560 North Carolina residents applied for federal assistance, with disaster aid totaling about $50million (2003USD, ($ USD)). Subsequent disaster declarations ultimately declared 47 North Carolina counties as disaster areas. By 12weeks after the hurricane passed through the state, 54,425 residents applied for federal assistance, with disaster aid totaling $155.2million (2003USD, ($ USD)).|$|E
5|$|Coropuna is drained by deep gorges, {{with water}} {{eventually}} reaching the Arma and Majes rivers, {{both of which}} empty into the Pacific Ocean. During the dry season, Coropuna's glaciers are {{a major source of}} <b>water</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> region, and concern has been raised that their disappearance may result in water shortages at a time when population growth has increased water consumption and begun to create conflict over water distribution. 30,000 people depend on the Coropuna glacier in one way or the other, 8,000 of them just for their water supply.|$|E
5|$|Demand {{for heavy}} water {{increased}} in the early 1950s. The heavy water facility at Wabash, now renamed the Dana Plant by the Atomic Energy Commission, was reopened, and DuPont resumed production of heavy water in May 1952. The site was used a pilot plant for a new production process using hydrogen sulphide. The heavy water facility was closed again in early 1957. The facility, and a larger complex at the Savannah River Site had fulfilled its purpose, supplying heavy <b>water</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> plutonium production reactors at Savannah River.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{commercial}} traffic ceasing in 1907, the infrastructure was maintained in good order, and the canal {{was used for}} the transport of potable water from 1962. The Countryside Act 1968 provided a framework for Somerset County Council to start the restoration of the canal as a leisure facility, which was completed in 1994, when the canal was reopened throughout. Bridgwater Docks have been restored as a marina, but there is no navigable connection to the River Parrett, as the canal still transports drinking <b>water</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> people of Bridgwater.|$|E
5|$|Early on August 27, {{the storm}} {{weakened}} below tropical storm status and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while moving over cooler waters. The system dissipated shortly after over open waters. Although the storm remained over <b>water</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> duration of its existence, the outer {{reaches of the}} system brought rain and light winds to Georgia, Florida, and the Carolinas. In Jacksonville, Florida, the storm produced 0.47 in (11.9 mm) of rain on August 25. Between August 26 and 27, Cape Hatteras received 2.06 in (52.3 mm) of rain from the storm.|$|E
5|$|From the hoppers, {{the waste}} falls onto the furnace-charging chute {{and from there}} onto the incinerating grate. Here it is burned at a {{temperature}} in excess of 1,200°C. This heat is then converted into super heated steam through the plant's boilers. This in turn powers steam turbines, much {{in the same way}} as a conventional thermal power station. Electricity is generated at 11 kilovolts. After exiting the turbines, the steam is condensed back to <b>water.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> original two incinerating lines use river water from the Tees as a cooling medium, whereas in the third line, water is condensed through air cooled condenser.
