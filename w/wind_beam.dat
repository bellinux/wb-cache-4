40|$|The plasma {{and field}} {{properties}} of large-amplitude magnetic field pulsatins upstream from the quasi-parallel {{region of the}} earth's bow shock are examined in high time resolution using data from ISEE 1 and 2. The relative timing of the magnetic field profiles observed at the two spacecraft shows {{that some of the}} pulsations are convecting antisunward across the spacecraft while others are brief out/in motions of bow shock across the spacecraft. Pulsations with both timing signatures are the site of slowing and heating of the solar wind plasma. The ions tend to be only weakly heated in the convecting pulsations, while within the out/in pulsations the ion heating can be quite substantial but variable. This variation occurs not only from pulsation to pulsation but also from point to point within a given pulsation. In general, the hottest distributions within the out/in pulsations tend to occur in regions of lower density and field strength. Magnetic pulsations bear a number of similarities to previously identified hot diamagnetic cavity events as well as to more durable crossings of the quasi-parallel shock itself. These various phenomena may be different manifestations of the same basic physical processes, in particular the coupling of coherently reflected ions to the solar <b>wind</b> <b>beam...</b>|$|E

40|$|Measurements {{conducted}} with the ASPERA- 4 instrument and the magnetometer of the Venus Express spacecraft show that the dynamic pressure of planetary O+ ion fluxes measured in the Venus wake can be significantly larger than the local magnetic pressure and, as a result, those ions are not being driven by magnetic forces but by the kinetic energy of the solar <b>wind.</b> <b>Beams</b> of planetary O+ ions with those properties have been detected in several orbits of the Venus Express through the wake as the spacecraft traverses by the noon-midnight plane along its near polar trajectory. The momentum flux of the O+ ions leads to superalfvenic flow conditions.

40|$|Concern for {{the safe}} navigation, the {{presence}} of an external force which directly induced on the ship maneuvering behavior is important to be captured. This paper discusses the course stability and yaw motion of ships traveling under steady wind condition in an analytical way. A course stability criterion and approximate formulas of yaw motion in steady wind including aero/hydro-dynamic force derivatives on the ship are derived. To confirm the reliability of the criterion and the formulas, the investigation results are introduced for the Pure Car Carrier (PCC) in steady wind. The results reveal that the course instability appears in head and following wind directions is mainly caused by the influence of aerodynamic derivatives with respect to the yaw restoring forces. However, the course instability can be easily improved by using a steering control. In the range from head <b>wind</b> to <b>beam</b> <b>wind,</b> the yaw oscillation appears where the period is relatively long and the damping is small. The analytical formulas newly derived are useful for {{a better understanding of the}} ship maneuvering behavior in steady wind. ...|$|R

The extended Hamilton’s principle is used to set up the equations of motion, and the Galerkin method is applied to reduce the aeroelastic coupled equations into a state-space form. Active control is developed to enhance the vibrational behavior and dynamic response to classical aerodynamic excitation and stabilize structures that might be damaged in the absence of control. Active optimal control scheme based on linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller is implemented.

40|$|Abstract — Wind {{speed is}} a most {{important}} weather parameter to record and monitor for many applications like meteorology, shipping, aviation etc. Wind observations are very important for general (operational) aviation meteorology, and weather prediction. Wind profilers are vertically directed pulsed Doppler radars which can analyze the back scattered signals and determine the velocity of air along the beams. In pulsed Doppler radar by steering beams by 15 ° from zenith, the vertical and horizontal components of the air moment can be obtained. Wind profiler systems are made for frequency bands that are around 50 MHz, 400 MHz, and 1000 MHz. The bands around 50 MHz are suited for high altitude measurements. This paper presents the design of Wind Profiler and discusses the {{issues such as the}} concept of wind profiler radar, how profilers estimate the moment of horizontal <b>wind,</b> Doppler <b>Beam</b> Swinging (DBS) technique for Wind velocity measurement.

These ion beams were mostly protons, were observed to have energies greater than solar wind protons, and were not gyrating, in agreement with reflections of the solar <b>wind</b> proton <b>beam.</b> Furthermore, in the foreshock region the ion energy gradually decreased toward the magnetosheath, in agreement with an acceleration by outward-directed electric field in the bowshock.

The Profiler system operated by the Wave Propagation Laboratory at NOAA has already shown great promise. As a result, plans are being considred for expanding the network of radars to cover a larger area of the country. The Profiler uses what is commonly referred to as the Doppler method for measuring <b>winds.</b> Two <b>beams</b> are pointed off-vertical, and the Doppler shift of the echo determines the line-of-sight velocity.

30|$|At first glance, a non-monotonic {{potential}} structure {{above the}} dayside surface seems implausible, but several intuitive explanations exist. First, consider {{the interface between}} the near-surface photoelectron sheath, which contains a cold electron population, and the solar wind, which contains a warmer incoming population. This physical situation, with two populations with unequal temperatures in contact, favors {{the formation of a}} double layer, with a potential drop on the order of the electron temperature difference (Ishiguro et al., 1985). The superposition of this new double layer with the original sheath naturally results in a non-monotonic potential. In addition, the non-monotonic potential helps to maintain quasi-neutrality upstream from the Moon. As an interplanetary magnetic field line contacts the dayside lunar surface, sunward-going electrons rapidly vacate the field line (because the Moon blocks additional sunward-going electrons from refilling these flux tubes), leaving only a portion of the solar wind electron distribution on the field lines upstream from the Moon. This population cannot balance the charge of the solar <b>wind</b> ion <b>beam.</b> The non-monotonic potential provides a resolution to this situation, by reflecting most of the incoming solar wind electrons, and accelerating enough photoelectrons to the electron temperature to balance any remaining deficit, thus much more closely maintaining quasi-neutrality upstream.|$|R

Comparisons with measurements by the IMP- 6 and ISEE- 1 spacecraft show that the spectrum and overall features of this noise {{are very similar to}} electrostatic noise observed at the Earth's bow shock. A stability analysis using realistic parameters shows that the electrostatic noise can be accounted for by an ion beam-plasma instability caused by the solar <b>wind</b> proton <b>beam</b> streaming through the nearly stationary lithium cloud. The growth rate of this instability is largest when the ion density and solar wind proton density are similar, which explains why the noise only occurs near {{the outer edge of the}} ion cloud. The similarity to the noise in the Earth's bow shock suggest that a shock may exist in the solar wind plasma flow upstream of the ion cloud. If the noise is associated with a shock, then it must be an electrostatic shock, since the ion cyclotron radii are too small for the existence of a MHD shock. Since the electrostatic instability occurs at phase velocities near the lithium thermal velocity, the electrostatic turbulence may play a role in heating the lithium ions and transferring momentum from the solar wind to the ion cloud...|$|R
