5|$|In Fauna boreali-americana, Richardson assigns the mammal to {{the now-defunct}} genus Diplostoma {{described}} by Rafinesque in 1817. He named it Diplostoma ? bulbivorum.

5|$|CTLS-4TAC – Designed {{for export}} under Lend-Lease, {{a total of}} 420 were produced, {{originally}} intended for China. Six hundred 4TACs and 4TAYs were sent to China after Pearl Harbor. The remaining 240 were dispersed for emergency situations, like in Alaska. The armor was doubled and the armament consisted of three 7.62mm (.30 cal) machine guns, {{one of which was}} mounted in a 240° traverse, hand-cranked turret. Under OCM 18526, the CTLS-4TAC <b>was</b> <b>labeled</b> Light Tank T16. All vehicles were scrapped in 1943.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the newest}} {{building}} began on December 4, 1936. The third state capitol was completed in 1938 and is the fourth-newest capitol in the United States. The capitol was dedicated on October 1, 1938, with speeches from President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Leslie M. Scott, Robert W. Sawyer, and Oregon Governor Charles Henry Martin. Chosen from 123 entries in a countrywide competition, {{the design of the}} new building deviated from the normal design of state capitol buildings. The design <b>was</b> <b>labeled</b> a combination of Egyptian simplicity and Greek refinement. Overall it is Art Deco in style, and is one of only three state capitols in the United States constructed in that architectural style.|$|E

5|$|Gameplay {{consists}} of racing in futuristic hovercrafts and using their speed-boosting abilities to navigate through the courses {{as quickly as}} possible in settings like the recurring Mute City, Big Blue and Port Town. The first game <b>was</b> <b>labeled</b> by critics as an influential video game that created the futuristic racing subgenre as well as inspired the creation of numerous racing games such as Daytona USA and the Wipeout series. The series casually centers around the F-Zero racer Captain Falcon and his talented racing and bounty hunting abilities as well as his encounters with the other F-Zero characters.|$|E
5|$|Hunt's first successes {{were in the}} oilfields of Arkansas, but he {{lost most}} of his fortune by {{the outset of the}} Depression as {{overproduction}} depleted his fields and his speculation on land and oil drained his resources. He joined in Columbus Joiner's venture which opened the East Texas Oil Field. Hunt bought most of Joiner's interests in eastern Texas and his company, Placid Oil, owned hundreds of wells. He became established in Dallas and <b>was</b> <b>labeled</b> the richest man in the nation in 1948 by Fortune Magazine. A scandal emerged in 1975, after his death, when it was discovered that he had had a hidden bigamous relationship, with his second wife living in New York.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, a {{prominent}} radio source was identified overlapping {{the location of}} M87, and this <b>was</b> <b>labeled</b> Virgo-A.

This jet extended from the core at a position angle of 260° to an angular distance of 20″ with an angular width of 2″. In 1969–70, a strong component of the radio emission was found to closely align with the optical source of the jet.|$|E

5|$|Martin was an {{integral}} member of the Cardinals' teams of the 1930s that {{became known as the}} Gashouse Gang for their roguish behavior and practical jokes. Early in his career, he <b>was</b> <b>labeled</b> by some contemporary press reports as the next Ty Cobb because of his spirited, hustling style of play. However, because his headlong attitude on the playing field took a physical toll on his body, he never lived up to those initial expectations. After the end of his playing career, he continued his career in baseball as a successful minor league baseball manager.|$|E

UC Irvine lost 58-64 {{in the first round}} of the 2014 National Invitation Tournament against SMU.

The agreement itself <b>was</b> <b>labeled</b> as treasonous by the central RSK authorities. Fischer and other UN officials, who were involved in mediation of the agreement, were criticised by the UN for being excessively assertive in the matter. Fischer soon left the area.|$|E

Halo 2 sold 2.4million copies making US$125 million in the first 24hours after its release beating the record for highest grossing entertainment release. Halo 3 grossed US$170million on its first day, $45million more than its predecessor. Halo 2 and Halo 3 are also the best selling titles of their respective consoles, the Xbox and the Xbox 360.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Asylums boss fights were criticized, {{with many}} reviewers {{labeling}} {{them as the}} game's biggest failing. Reviewers found that the battles often rely on old-fashioned, tedious, and repetitive game tropes that required the player to learn and repeat monotonous routinessome of which, {{in the case of}} Bane, had already been employed on lesser enemiesor to confront repetitive attack patterns and one-hit deaths. Reviewers generally agreed that the fights were anti-climactic to their build-up spectacle. The final boss fight with the Joker was singled out for vapid gameplay, a battle with Killer Croc <b>was</b> <b>labeled</b> boring and overly long, and the reviewers said these should not have been in the game. However, the fear toxin-induced hallucination segments of Scarecrow's battles were almost unanimously praised as some of the game's best and most cerebral moments for their fourth wall manipulation, subversion of the game's established narrative and expectations, and meta-textual influences that were compared to the battle against Psycho Mantis in 1998's Metal Gear Solid, and 2002's Eternal Darkness.|$|E

5|$|Ferguson again moved on, {{this time}} {{accepting}} the player-manager role {{with the new}} Troy Trojans team who began {{their time in the}} National League in 1879, and would stay in that role until the team folded after the 1882 season. In 1883, he became the first manager {{in the history of the}} Philadelphia Phillies franchise, which was known at the time as the Quakers, but was relieved of command when the team won only four of its first 17games. On August 21 of that season, his Quakers traveled to Providence, Rhode Island to play the Grays. To increase ticket sales, he gave the day's pitching duty to Rhode Island native Art Hagan in hopes that Hagan's appearance would attract more locals to come watch the game. The strategy worked, but Hagen surrendered 28 runs and the Quakers made 20 errors behind him and did not score a run. Financially sound decision as it was, a bad decision for public relations as Ferguson <b>was</b> <b>labeled</b> a sadist for not relieving Hagen.|$|E
5|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1000 feet in length, {{was released}} on June 14, 1910. Theater advertisements for the film were found in newspapers in Indiana, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Ohio. The film was alternatively known and advertised as Taming a Woman Hater. One theater in Pennsylvania would advertise Thanhouser's Jane Eyre as a magnificent and costly production and follow it up with The Woman Hater with the generic advertisement promotion {{that it was a}} great film. It is unknown if published trade reviews for this work exist, but there is an absence of a citation Bowers. Given this absence, it is possible that additional details or commentary can be obtained from advertisements or local newspapers outside of typical trade publications. The film <b>was</b> <b>labeled</b> a comedy in an advertisement, using the name Taming a Woman Hater in The New York Dramatic Mirror on June 18, 1910.|$|E
5|$|Tracy Hickman and Laura Curtis {{married in}} 1977. Soon after, {{while living in}} Provo, Utah, they wrote the adventures Pharaoh and Ravenloft. When they began work on Ravenloft, they felt the vampire {{archetype}} had become overused, trite, and mundane, and decided to create a frightening version of the creature for the module. They play-tested it {{with a group of}} players every Halloween for five years before it was published in 1983 by TSR. The plot combined elements of the horror genre with Dungeons & Dragons conventions for the first time. At the time of Ravenlofts release, each Dungeons & Dragons module was marked with an alphanumeric code indicating the series to which it belonged. Ravenloft <b>was</b> <b>labeled</b> I6: the sixth in a series of intermediate-level modules for the first edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD). It consisted of a 32-page book, with separate maps that detailed locations in the adventure scenario.|$|E
