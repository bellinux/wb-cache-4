Note that true dynamic similitude may require matching other dimensionless numbers as well, such as the Mach number used in compressible flows, or the Froude number that governs open-channel flows. Some flows involve more dimensionless parameters than can be practically satisfied with the available apparatus and fluids, so one is forced to decide <b>which</b> <b>parameters</b> are most important.

[...] The boundary for this [...] "impossible region" [...] {{is determined by}} (symmetric or skewed) bimodal [...] "U"-shaped distributions for <b>which</b> <b>parameters</b> α and β approach zero and hence all the probability density is concentrated at the ends: x = 0, 1 with practically nothing in between them. [...] Since for α ≈ β ≈ 0 the probability density is concentrated at the two ends x = 0 and x = 1, this [...] "impossible boundary" [...] is determined by a 2-point distribution: the probability can only take 2 values (Bernoulli distribution), one value with probability p {{and the other with}} probability q = 1−p. For cases approaching this limit boundary with symmetry α = β, skewness ≈ 0, excess kurtosis ≈ −2 (this is the lowest excess kurtosis possible for any distribution), and the probabilities are p ≈ q ≈ 1/2. [...] For cases approaching this limit boundary with skewness, excess kurtosis ≈ −2 + skewness2, and the probability density is concentrated more at one end than the other end (with practically nothing in between), with probabilities [...] at the left end x = 0 and [...] at the right end x = 1.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the properties and relations of {{two classes of}} operational bipartite and multipartite entanglement measures, the so-called source and the accessible entanglement. The former measures {{how easy it is}} to generate a given state via local operations and classical communication (LOCC) from some other state, whereas the latter measures the potentiality of a state to be convertible to other states via LOCC. Main emphasis is put on the bipartite pure states, single copy regime. We investigate <b>which</b> <b>parameter</b> regime is physically available, i. e for which values of these measures does there exist a bipartite pure state. Moreover, we determine, given some state, <b>which</b> <b>parameter</b> regime can be accessed by it and from <b>which</b> <b>parameter</b> regime it can be accessed. We show that this regime can be determined analytically using the Postitivstellensatz. Moreover, we compute the boundaries of these sets and the boundaries of the corresponding source and accessible sets. Furthermore, we relate these results to other entanglement measures and compare their behaviors. Apart from that, an operational characterization of bipartite pure state entanglement is presented.

While for certain capital values increasing returns to scale are reasonable, usually this property does not hold in general.

30|$|Finally, it is {{important}} to note that the aforementioned results and interpretations are made from a modelling point of view, i.e. <b>which</b> <b>parameter</b> describes the measured HED activity best. This might be different from <b>which</b> <b>parameter</b> actually describes myocardial presynaptic activity best. Ideally, a blocking study or animal study should be performed to compare the obtained parameters with a gold standard measurement. In addition, the performance of the quantitative parameters used in the present study needs to be assessed in clinical studies, as the added clinical value of VT over simplified measures such as RIP still needs to be defined. Whilst simulations (see Additional file 1) show that quantitative measures are more sensitive to changes in k 3, the rate constant reflecting norepinephrine transport, RI also showed significant correlation with k 3, suggesting that RI may be sufficiently sensitive for measuring (changes in) innervation. Further clinical validation studies using RIP, RIWB, SUV and VT are warranted.|$|R
