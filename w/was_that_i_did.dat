2500|$|Pilots and airline {{personnel}} throughout the industry petitioned the NTSB to revise its report. First Officer Claude Ouimet sent the NTSB a detailed defence of the crew's actions, including {{the decision to}} land in Cincinnati instead of Standiford Field Airport in Louisville, Kentucky, the airport closest to where the crew first notified Air Traffic Control in Indianapolis, Indiana, {{that they needed to}} make an emergency landing. Ouimet stated that Louisville was too close to be able to descend from cruising altitude to an emergency landing safely, and even landing in Cincinnati was a questionable proposition given Cameron's difficulties in controlling the plane. After reviewing Ouimet's missive and re-evaluating the available data, the NTSB issued a revised version of the report which included Ouimet's explanation of the landing decision, though the report was still critical of Cameron's decision not to inquire about the fire itself. [...] "All I know <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> the best I could," [...] Cameron later said. [...] "I'm very sorry the people that didn't get off, didn't get off, because {{we spent a lot of}} time and effort getting them there." ...|$|E
60|$|The wonder <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not kill}} {{him on the}} spot. I cannot think what possessed the man,--he must have known me better.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{thinking}} how very unfortunate it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not breakfast with Lyndhurst this morning, as I was nearly doing, {{instead of going}} down to Eton.' ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I did Jacques's {{first film}} {{so it has}} to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> his first American film," [...] said Aimee.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{then it is}} his own concern, and not mine. What my Maker {{requires}} <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> my duty, and not {{fret about}} my neighbor's." ...|$|R
6000|$|Kenwardine laughed. [...] "You're remarkably frank; but there's {{some truth}} {{in what you}} say, {{although}} the convention <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> guarantee them and their honor's mine." ...|$|R
60|$|The most {{surprising}} {{part of the}} whole thing to me <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not feel in the least alarmed. If anything, I was rather pleased to see him. It was company.|$|E
60|$|But that I {{will tell}} about later. The point I {{was coming to}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not realise until after the crash how {{recklessly}} my uncle had kept his promise of paying a dividend of over eight per cent. on the ordinary shares of that hugely over-capitalised enterprise, Household Services.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Miss Walters, that is {{not quite}} true. I ought not to have said it to friends so kind as you have all shown yourselves to be. No; my real reason <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not wish to grieve you unnecessarily, and even now I {{would not have done}} so, only----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} to justify him in saying <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ever engaged to the young lady. The truth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> ask her and she,--refused me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> or <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ought not to do. But all my life {{everything}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have <b>done</b> at Perivale has always been wrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You may say so in a {{very special}} and {{emphatic}} sense," [...] said Turnbull. [...] "I {{do not believe in}} nature, just as <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not believe in Odin. She is a myth. It <b>is</b> not merely <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not believe <b>that</b> nature can guide us. It <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not believe <b>that</b> nature exists." ...|$|R
6000|$|I was so startled at this totally {{irrelevant}} {{reference to}} the worthy collector of chimpanzees with whom I ought to have dined that evening, that I glanced sharply at Grant. The result <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not look at Mr Shorter. I only heard him answer, in his most nervous tone, [...] "No." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{end of it}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not enjoy}} my pipe that night, though luckily Anscombe {{returned}} after a successful evening's netting, about which he {{was so full of}} talk that {{there was no need for}} me to say much. So I put off any discussion of the problem until the morrow.|$|E
60|$|It {{was only}} those {{officers}} {{who refused to}} give their parole who were confined at Dartmoor, {{and most of the}} prisoners were seamen, or from the ranks. You ask me, perhaps, why it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not give this parole, and so enjoy the same good treatment as most of my brother officers. Well, I had two reasons, and both of them were sufficiently strong.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not come}} to the church this morning in order to {{distress}} you: <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not, Cytherea. It was to try to speak to you before you were--married.' ...|$|R
500|$|Minaj {{talked about}} {{feminism}} {{in an interview}} with Vogue in 2015, saying [...] "There <b>are</b> things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> feminists don't like, and there <b>are</b> things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> they <b>do</b> like. <b>I</b> don't label myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My answer <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> desire this lady, O High-priest, and <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> can I will obtain from Kari {{the promise}} of what you seek. And now where is the loophole?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was hopping along mighty fast when whom should I {{see just}} ahead of me on the path but Mr. Fox, {{standing}} with his head cocked over on one side as he always holds it when he's up to some mischief. I was in a terrible hurry, but it seemed safer to stop a bit till I'd found out {{what he was up}} to, and lucky it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'My Cilly {{days were}} over long ago. Only one person ever {{used to call}} me Cilla;' and she paused, and went on afresh--'So it was for Bertha's sake and Mervyn's that Honor escorted you abroad. So much Robert told me; but I don't {{understand}} it yet. It had haunted me the whole winter that Robert was the only Mr. Fulmort she could nurse; and if he told you I was upset, it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not quite know whether he were ghost or body when I saw him there in the old place.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{wonderful}} {{that all these}} things should never have occurred to me, aunt. I see now how fortunate it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not {{fall in love with}} him. And now, Netta, as we have finished breakfast, we will put on our things at once and go and consult our physician in ordinary. We have a fair chance of being the first to arrive if we start immediately. I told Roberts to have the carriage at the door at half-past nine, and he does not begin to see patients until ten." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The darlings!" [...] cried Proserpina; {{and then}} she thought to herself, [...] "I <b>was</b> looking at <b>that</b> spot only a moment ago. How strange it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not see the flowers!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No: its too much. The plain truth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> {{care whether}} she finds me out or not. I {{want her to}} {{understand}} thoroughly, once and for ever, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wont marry her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] cried Elizabeth,--"no. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not know}} him. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know him. There is something.... But I don't know. All <b>I</b> know <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know him." [...] Her {{face was a}} face of {{infinite}} distress.|$|R
6000|$|At last, {{like many}} another man when {{in a similar}} predicament, I {{concluded}} to let circumstances shape my plan of action, and set forth for Mrs. Raynor's house. The walk was a long one, but I turned in order to pass under the tree where I had begun to dictate to Sylvia; and glad I <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> so, for to the twig on which I had hung the case containing her inkstand there was now attached a half sheet of note paper. I ran to the tree, eagerly seized the paper, and read these few words that were written on it:-- ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could never}} get the Swift One to join with them. Whenever I visited them she dropped behind and disappeared. I {{remember}} once making a strong effort to persuade her. But she cast backward, anxious glances, then retreated, calling to me from a tree. So it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not make a practice of accompanying Lop-Ear {{when he went to}} visit his new friends. The Swift One and I were good comrades, but, try as I would, I could never find her tree-shelter. Undoubtedly, had nothing happened, we would have soon mated, for our liking was mutual; but the something did happen.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was glad}} that day that Bernard liked to go fishing, for my mind {{was in such a}} {{condition}} that I did not think of anything that might happen to him--at least, anything but just one thing, and that was awful. Emily Cheston supposed I had a headache, and I let her think so, for it gave me more time to myself. I looked at the thing that threatened to crush all my happiness, on every possible side. Early in the morning a ray of relief had come to my troubled mind, and this <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not believe he would have her, anyway. But I had seen her since, and no such ray comforted me now.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{opposing}} {{a theory}} to a fact," [...] Mrs. Mortimer stated. [...] "The fact <b>is</b> <b>that</b> all the farmers {{do not do}} it. The fact <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> receive double the price. You can't get away from that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So, Douglas, {{you have}} learnt the truth. Well, I am glad of it. You believe in me now? You always may. Looking back upon our last {{interview}} my only regret <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not tell you}} the whole truth then.|$|R
5000|$|... 6. a) *This <b>is</b> the girli <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> {{know what}} ti [...] said. b) This <b>is</b> the girli <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> know what shei said.|$|R
60|$|So I had {{not given}} myself much concern about what I should wear; and deemed it wholly {{unnecessary}} to provide myself with a great outfit of pilot-cloth jackets, and browsers, and Guernsey frocks, and oil-skin suits, and sea-boots, and many other things, which old seamen carry in their chests. But one reason <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not {{have the money to}} buy them with, even if I had wanted to. So in addition to the clothes I had brought from home, I had only bought a red shirt, a tarpaulin hat, and a belt and knife, as I have previously related, which gave me a sea outfit, something like the Texan rangers', whose uniform, they say, consists of a shirt collar and a pair of spurs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shinny on {{your own}} side!" [...] said the man with glasses. [...] "You never heard any such music from my foghorn. What I said <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not believe it {{practicable}} just now. The guys with wads {{are not in the}} frame of mind to slack up on the mazuma, and the man with the portable tin banqueting canister isn't exactly ready to join the Bible class. You can bet your variegated socks that the situation is all spifflicated up from the Battery to breakfast! What the country needs is for some bully old bloke like Cobden or some wise guy like old Ben Franklin to sashay up to the front and biff the nigger's head with the baseball. Do you catch my smoke? What?" ...|$|E
60|$|Through all my father's {{troubles}} {{he still}} desired {{to send me}} either to Oxford or Cambridge. My elder brother went to Oxford, and Henry to Cambridge. It all depended on my ability to get some scholarship that would help me to live at the University. I had many chances. There were exhibitions from Harrow--which I never got. Twice I tried for a sizarship at Clare Hall,--but in vain. Once I made a futile attempt for a scholarship at Trinity, Oxford,--but failed again. Then {{the idea of a}} university career was abandoned. And very fortunate it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not succeed, for my career with such assistance only as a scholarship would have given me, would have ended in debt and ignominy.|$|E
6000|$|Jack. It pains me {{very much}} to have to speak frankly to you, Lady Bracknell, about your nephew, but the fact <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not approve at all of his moral character. I suspect him of being untruthful. [Algernon and Cecily look at him in indignant amazement.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, no,' {{replied the}} man-brother. 'The fact <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not {{get up to}} them till we had run half way across the world and left the wind far behind us. Think what a trouble {{it would have been}} to drag it here! So--I just ate them both.' ...|$|R
60|$|No {{man will}} really attempt to {{describe}} his feelings, when he first stood at the gateway of the grave of Christ. The only record relevant here <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not feel the reaction, not to say repulsion, that many seem to have felt about its formal surroundings.|$|R
