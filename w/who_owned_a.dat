5|$|The {{opening of}} the Tennant Canal in 1824 {{inspired}} Elizabeth Davies, <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>a</b> lollipop-shop in Neath, to write a 19-verse poem, which was published by Filmer Fagg of Swansea.|$|E
5|$|Arnold's command at West Point {{also gave}} him {{authority}} over the entire American-controlled Hudson River, from Albany down to the British lines outside New York City. While en route to West Point, Arnold renewed an acquaintance with Joshua Hett Smith, who had spied for both sides and <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>a</b> house near the western bank of the Hudson about 15 miles south of West Point.|$|E
5|$|ATV Music {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} the Lennon–McCartney song catalogue, Northern Songs, in 1969. The catalog featured almost every song written by Lennon–McCartney. Northern Songs was co-owned by Lennon, McCartney, Brian Epstein and Dick James, <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>a</b> controlling interest. In 1969, James offered to sell his shares to ATV. Lennon and McCartney then attempted to gain a controlling interest in the company. Their bid to gain control, part of a long and acrimonious fight, failed. The financial clout of Grade, their adversary in the bidding war, ensured that the songs written by the two Beatles passed into the control of ATV.|$|E

5|$|Harvey {{was born}} on 9 October 1969 in Bridport, Dorset, as the second child of Ray and Eva Harvey, <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>a</b> stone {{quarrying}} business, and {{grew up on the}} family's farm in Corscombe. During her childhood, she attended school in nearby Beaminster, where she received guitar lessons from folk singer-songwriter Steve Knightley, and her parents introduced her to music that would later influence her work, including blues music, Captain Beefheart and Bob Dylan. Her parents were avid music fans and regularly arranged get-togethers and small gigs; among their oldest friends was Ian Stewart.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Beebe {{traveled}} to Georgetown {{in pursuit of}} his earlier goal of establishing a permanent field research station in Guiana. After following several leads which came to nothing, his goal was realized when George Withers, <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>a</b> rubber plantation on the Mazaruni River, offered him {{the use of a}} large house on his property for this purpose. Soon after Beebe and his researchers moved into the plantation house, which was known by the name of Kalacoon, they were paid a visit by Theodore Roosevelt and his family. Roosevelt subsequently wrote an article about the station for Scribner's Magazine, which helped to build public support for the station.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, Iacob Ber Ghimpel, <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>a</b> Yiddish theater there, {{was glad}} to have a figure of Goldfaden's stature. Goldfaden {{completed}} the play he'd started in Paris, Rabi Yoselman, oder Die Gzerot fun Alsas ("Rabbi Yoselman, or The Alsatian Decree"), in five acts and 23 scenes, based on the life of Josel of Rosheim. At this time he also wrote an operetta Rothschild and a semi-autobiographical play called Mashiach Tzeiten (Messiah Times) that gave a less-than-optimistic view of America.|$|E

5|$|O'Leary {{was born}} in 1890, one of four {{children}} of Daniel and Margaret O'Leary, <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>a</b> farm at Inchigeela, near Macroom in County Cork, Ireland. Daniel O'Leary was a fervent Irish nationalist and keen sportsman who participated in competitive weightlifting and football. Aged 16 and unwilling {{to continue to work}} on his parent's land, Michael O'Leary joined the Royal Navy, serving at the shore establishment HMS Vivid at Devonport for several years until rheumatism in his knees forced his departure from the service. Within a few months however, O'Leary had again tired of the farm and joined the Irish Guards regiment of the British Army.|$|E
5|$|Pliny {{moves into}} {{crystallography}} and mineralogy, describing the octahedral {{shape of the}} diamond and recording that diamond dust is used by gem engravers to cut and polish other gems, owing to its great hardness. He states that rock crystal is valuable for its transparency and hardness, and can be carved into vessels and implements. He relates {{the story of a}} woman <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>a</b> ladle made of the mineral, paying the sum of 150,000 sesterces for the item. Nero deliberately broke two crystal cups when he realised {{that he was about to}} be deposed, so denying their use to anyone else.|$|E
5|$|Sorga Ka Toedjoe was {{directed}} by brothers Joshua and Othniel Wong for Tan's Film, a company owned by the ethnic Chinese brothers Khoen Yauw and Khoen Hian. The Tan brothers, <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>a</b> pair of cinemas, had {{been active in the}} industry since Njai Dasima in 1929. The Wongs had worked for Tan's since 1938, when they directed the hit film Fatima, helping to reestablish the company after it had been dissolved in 1932. Sorga Ka Toedjoe was shot in black-and-white, with some scenes filmed at Telaga Warna, near Buitenzorg.|$|E

5|$|Wiesenthal and {{his brother}} {{attended}} high school at the Humanistic Gymnasium in Buchach, where classes were taught in Polish. There Simon met his future wife, Cyla Müller, who he would marry in 1936. Hillel fell and broke his back in 1923 and died the following year. Rosa remarried in 1926 and moved to Dolyna with her new husband, Isack Halperin, <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>a</b> tile factory there. Wiesenthal remained in Buczacz, living with the Müller family, until he graduated from high school—on his second attempt—in 1928.|$|E
5|$|Another of {{the early}} subwoofers was {{developed}} during the late 1960s by Ken Kreisel, {{the former president of}} the Miller & Kreisel Sound Corporation in Los Angeles. When Kreisel's business partner, Jonas Miller, <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>a</b> high-end audio store in Los Angeles, told Kreisel that some purchasers of the store's high-end electrostatic speakers had complained about a lack of bass response in the electrostatics, Kreisel designed a powered woofer that would reproduce only those frequencies that were too low for the electrostatic speakers to convey. Infinity's full range electrostatic speaker system that was developed during the 1960s also used a woofer to cover the lower frequency range that its electrostatic arrays did not handle adequately.|$|E
5|$|Following their Star Search audition, Johnny and the Moondogs {{changed their}} name to Japage 3 (combining letters {{from each of}} the member's names: John, Paul, and George). Lennon had a friend from art school, named Derek Hodkin, <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>a</b> tape recorder, and Lennon {{convinced}} him to record the group (along with McCartney's brother Mike on drums). The group then asked Hodkin to act as their manager, and he agreed. Despite Hodkin's management, bookings for the group dried up. Harrison began a stint as rhythm guitarist in the Les Stewart Quartet, who had a weekly club engagement. By May, Japage 3 was defunct, although the three continued to see each other socially, and Lennon and McCartney continued to write songs together.|$|E

5|$|Grissom {{attended}} {{public elementary}} schools, {{and went on}} to Mitchell High School. He met and befriended Betty Lavonne Moore, his future wife, at school through their extracurricular activities. His boy scout troop carried the American flag at school basketball games, while she played the drum in the high school band. His first jobs were delivering newspapers for the Indianapolis Star in the morning, and the Bedford Times in the evening. He also worked at a local meat market, a service station, and a clothing store. He occasionally spent time at a local airport in Bedford, Indiana, where he first became interested in flying. A local attorney <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>a</b> small plane would take him on flights for a $1 fee and taught him the basics of flying.|$|E
5|$|Howe {{was born}} in 1871 in Indianapolis, Indiana, to wealthy parents, Eliza and Edward P. Howe, <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>a</b> store {{and part of a}} {{wholesale}} business. Edward P. Howe, originally from Cincinnati, Ohio, had been a captain with the Union Army in the Civil War and made an unsuccessful run for the Indiana State Senate as a Democrat before Louis' birth. Louis had two stepsisters, Maria and Cora, from his mother's previous marriage. Howe was sickly and fragile as a child, suffered from asthma, and was generally kept home by his parents; he would never grow to more than five feet tall. Fearing to expose Howe to public school, his parents instead enrolled him in an all-girls seminary.|$|E
5|$|In {{previous}} works, Hergé {{had drawn}} upon {{a variety of}} pictorial sources, such as newspaper clippings, from which to draw the scenes and characters; for The Secret of the Unicorn he drew upon an unprecedented variety of these sources. In drawing {{many of the old}} vessels, Hergé initially consulted the then recently published L'Art et la Mer ("Art and the Sea") by Alexandre Berqueman. Seeking further accurate depictions of old naval vessels, Hergé consulted a friend of his, Gérard Liger-Belair, <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>a</b> Brussels shop specialising in model ships. Liger-Belair produced plans of a 17th-century French fifty-gun warship for Hergé to copy; Le Brillant, which had been constructed in Le Havre in 1690 by the shipwright Salicon and then decorated by Jean Bérain the Elder.|$|E

5|$|Permanent {{habitation}} on {{this part}} of the St. Johns River came only during Florida's British period, when officials established a ferry crossing at the Cow Ford in 1760. The ferry docked on the river's southern bank, which was thus populated continuously long before what is now downtown Jacksonville. When the Spanish resumed control of Florida in 1783 they built Fort San Nicolas beside the ferry landing in present-day St. Nicholas. In 1793 the Spanish government issued a land grant for a slave plantation, which was eventually taken over by Isaac Hendricks. By 1850, Hendricks had married Elizabeth Hudnall, <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>a</b> large adjacent tract, and his daughter Margaret married Albert Gallatin Philips, owner of the nearby Red Bank Plantation; as a result much of the area was owned by families connected to each other by marriage.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{cast the}} actors by {{approaching}} customers {{at a local}} gas station whenever he saw somebody that looked like they fit one of the parts. He hired high school students as crew members who helped load and move equipment. For the creature itself, he limited the sightings to shadowy figures because he felt the film would be more frightening if the creature was left to the viewer's imagination. Pierce sang the theme song featured in the film. Once the film was completed, he put the reel {{into the trunk of}} his car and drove to Los Angeles seeking post-production services. He met Jamie Mendoza-Nava, <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>a</b> small post-production company and agreed to work on the film for limited up-front pay and {{a small percentage of the}} film's box-office receipts. Pierce could not find a major studio willing to distribute it, so he rented a local movie theater in Texarkana for one week to screen the film. He cleaned the property himself to prepare for the debut.|$|E
5|$|Rymkus {{was born}} in Royalton, Illinois, {{the son of a}} Lithuanian {{immigrant}} coal miner <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>a</b> small grocery store. After his father was shot and killed outside the grocery store, Rymkus and his family moved to the Back of the Yards neighborhood on Chicago's South Side. With family finances tight, he took a number of odd jobs, including working as a laborer and delivering newspapers and groceries. At the suggestion of a friend, Rymkus attended Tilden Tech, now known as Tilden High School, and began to display talent as a lineman on the school's football team. He blocked a kick and scored a touchdown in a game at Chicago's Soldier Field in 1936 against rival Austin High, a play he later said was the most memorable of his high school career. Rymkus won seven letters at Tilden playing on the football, track and wrestling teams. As a senior, he defeated Rudy Mucha to win the Chicago prep-school wrestling title.|$|E

40|$|Standard {{theories}} of so-called donkey anaphora (Kamp 1981, Heim 1982, Groenendijk and Stokhof 1991) predict that sentence (1) is truth conditionally equivalent to (2). (1) Every farmer <b>who</b> <b>owns</b> <b>a</b> donkey beats it. (2) Every farmer <b>who</b> <b>owns</b> <b>a</b> donkey beats every donkey that he owns. I will {{refer to the}} proposition expressed by (2) as the strong reading of (1). A nonstandard theory, defended by King (1993, 2004), predicts that (1) is equivalent to (3). (3) Every farmer <b>who</b> <b>owns</b> <b>a</b> donkey beats a donkey that he owns. The proposition expressed by (3) is the weak reading of (1). Although the authors I have referred to disagree {{about how best to}} interpret (1), they agree that (1) is not ambiguous; it semantically expresses no more than one reading. Not everyone shares this opinion, though. Schubert and Pelletier (1989), Kanazawa (1994), and Chierchia (1995) suggested that sentences relevantly like (1) are ambiguous. 2 Consider, for example, sentences (4) –(6). (4) Everyone <b>who</b> <b>owns</b> <b>an</b> umbrella leaves it at home on a sunny day. (5) Everyone <b>who</b> <b>owns</b> <b>an</b> umbrella uses it on a rainy day...|$|R
