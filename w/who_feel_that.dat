They part ways for lunch, and Annie meets Silver (Jessica Stroup); however, Naomi pulls Annie away, explaining that Silver makes insulting YouTube videos about people. Naomi invites Annie to her birthday party, and they decide to go shopping together. Harry and guidance counselor Kelly Taylor (Jennie Garth) and Mr.Matthews meet with Naomi's parents, <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> Naomi {{should not have to}} hand in her assignments on time when she is planning her party. Before she leaves, Naomi's mother, Tracy (Christina Moore), reminds Harry that they dated in high school. Naomi receives a text message from her mother, telling her that she must complete the assignment that night. Annie remembers that she completed a similar assignment for her old school, and offers to give Naomi a copy for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|The changes seen {{in series}} VII were {{seen by some}} as a disappointment; while much slicker and higher-budget in appearance, the shift away from {{outright}} sitcom and into something approaching comedy drama was seen as a move in the wrong direction. Furthermore, the attempt to shift back into traditional sitcom format for series VIII was greeted with a response that was similarly lukewarm. There was criticism aimed at the decision to resurrect the entire crew of Red Dwarf, as it was felt this detracted from the series' central premise of Lister being the last human being alive. There are other critics <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> series VII and VIII are no weaker than the earlier series, however, and the topic is the subject of constant fervent debate among the show's fanbase.|$|E

25|$|Sentences of {{the second}} type are called false passives by some linguists, <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> such {{sentences}} are simply confused with the passive voice due to their outward similarity. Other linguists consider the second type {{to be a different}} kind of passive – a stative or static passive, in contrast to the dynamic or eventive passive illustrated by the first sentence. Some languages express or can express these different meanings using different constructions.|$|E
25|$|A {{comprehensive}} list {{of differences}} between the American and British editions of the books is collected at the Harry Potter Lexicon web site. The changes are mostly simple lexical switches to reflect the different dialects and prevent American readers from stumbling over unfamiliar Briticisms. Changes of this sort are common when adapting any text from British to American editions {{but in the case}} of the Harry Potter books, this standard practice has occasionally drawn criticism from readers <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> the British English adds flavour to the series. Rowling herself expressed regret after changing the first book's title, as the Philosopher's Stone is a legendary alchemical substance.|$|E
25|$|Melton’s {{scholarly}} works {{concentrate on}} the phenomenology and not the theology of NRMs. Some Christian countercultists criticize Melton for not critiquing the groups he reports on from an evangelical perspective, arguing that his {{failure to do so}} is incompatible with his statements of professed evangelicalism. Some secular anti-cultists <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> new religious movements are dangerous and that scholars should actively work against them have likewise criticized him. Stephen A. Kent and Theresa Krebs, for example, characterized Gordon Melton, James R. Lewis, and Anson Shupe as biased towards the groups they study. In non-scholarly writings, Melton has recommended that Christian churches should examine new religions in terms of evangelization, and he sees his work as a means to facilitate that end.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry {{has drawn}} {{criticism}} among chemists <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> the prize is more frequently awarded to non-chemists than to chemists. In the 30 years {{leading up to}} 2012, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry had been awarded ten times for work that resides in biochemistry or molecular biology, and once to a materials scientist. In the ten {{years leading up to}} 2012, only four prizes had been for work that is indisputably in chemistry. Commenting on this issue, The Economist writes that the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences is bound by Nobel's will, which specified only awards in physics, chemistry, literature, medicine, and peace. Biology was in its infancy during Nobel's day, which led to no award being established. The Economist also points out that no Nobel Prizes are awarded for another major discipline, mathematics, and that Nobel's rigid not-more-than-three-winners stipulation is not easily applicable to modern physics, in which progress is often made by huge collaborations and not individual scientists.|$|E

500|$|Also, {{instead of}} turning further inward to {{preserve}} a cohesive Christian community, Cobb turned outward in order to discover truths that Christianity may not yet possess. [...] This is in direct opposition to those <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> Christianity as a religious system is absolutely final, complete, and free of error. [...] Cobb has not only turned to other religions (most notably Buddhism) in order to supplement Christian ideas and systems, but also to other disciplines, including biology, physics, and economics.|$|E

[...] Both La Malinche and Clemencia were mistresses to men of a different ethnicity than their own, [...] "doomed to exist within a racial and class-cultural wasteland, unanchored by a sense of ever belonging either to [...] ethnic or [...] natal homeland". [...] Clemencia's final revenge in this vignette is not only a triumph in the memory of La Malinche, but also for the women <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> their value depreciates if {{they do not have a}} husband.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{lyrics are}} {{described}} as 'politically, socially and personally conscious', incorporating themes such as corporate greed, racism and {{growing up in a}} broken home. Butler says it is [...] "an ode to the disenfranchised and disaffected youth" [...] and about accepting that we will never be perfect. Some of the lyrics reflect on his early life where he had to raise his sister and grow up at the same time. He added ambiguity to the lyrics to [...] "facilitate" [...] ideas for the listeners. Freeman said that the lyrics [...] "reveal just how self-aware he is, which is a good counterpoint to those <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> his constant vocalizing equates to selfishness." ...|$|E

However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E

500|$|Critics have {{compared}} levels, particularly first levels, of later Sonic games to Green Hill. Turi considers Emerald Hill from Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Mushroom Hill from Sonic & Knuckles, and Seaside Hill from Sonic Heroes {{to fit the}} same general mold as Green Hill, noting repetition in Sonic level design and stating that [...] "gamers have played Green Hill Zone dozens of times." [...] However, he has opined that the Sonic Generations version of the original Green Hill [...] "trounces them all" [...] in both its 2D and 3D incarnations. Justin Baker of Nintendo World Report and Skrebels both analogized Windy Hill from Sonic Lost World to Green Hill, while Carter thought similarly of The Legend of Zelda downloadable content levels. The decision to include Green Hill in other titles in the series, such as Sonic Forces, {{has been a source}} of debate among some fans, <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> Sega has overused the stage since its debut.|$|E
500|$|In {{developing}} the storyline {{of the series}} Featherstone said that [...] "the team took what was wonderful from [...] and then forgot about it, in the nicest possible way, and made their own show." [...] While working for the series, Richards worked with Hans Rosenfeldt, the Swedish writer who created The Bridge. Many aspects of the first episode are virtual copies of the first episode of the Scandinavian series, including: the female lead [...] "stripping unselfconsciously to her underwear in the office", the male lead's relationship with his teenage son, and the [...] "sleazy journalist [...] held captive in his own car with a ticking bomb", the last {{of which was a}} sequence Richards wanted to repeat in the remake. However, Richards said that as the series progressed and the drama unfolded the storylines would diverge from the original. Featherstone also noted there would be plenty of changes, saying that many had [...] "seen both , <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> they get satisfaction because the characters go on different journeys and the actors all bring a whole new level of interest in it".|$|E
500|$|Poets in the Romantic Era recast {{the myth}} and adapted {{the image of}} the {{nightingale}} with its song to be a poet and “master of a superior art that could inspire the human poet”. For some romantic poets, the nightingale even began to take on qualities of the muse. John Keats (1795–1821), in [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] (1819) idealizes the nightingale as a poet who has achieved the poetry that Keats himself longs to write. [...] Keats directly employs the Philomel myth in [...] "The Eve of St. Agnes" [...] (1820) where the rape of Madeline by Porphyro mirrors the rape of Philomela by Tereus. Keats' contemporary, poet Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792–1822) invoked a similar image of the nightingale, writing in his A Defence of Poetry that [...] "a poet is a nightingale who sits in darkness and sings to cheer its own solitude with sweet sounds; his auditors are as men entranced by the melody of an unseen musician, <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> they are moved and softened, yet know not whence or why.” ...|$|E
