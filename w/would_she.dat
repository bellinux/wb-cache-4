The two lived in Plainfield, New Jersey. On March 14, 2007, the Associated Press reported that McGreevey was seeking custody of Jacqueline and filing for child support. Matos demanded $600,000 plus alimony. The divorce trial started on May 6, 2008. On August 8, the divorce was granted. McGreevey received joint custody and pays child support. They will also be using a parenting coordinator. Matos was denied alimony.

25|$|Her Imperial Majesty Empress Elisabeth of Austria visited Summerhill House in February 1879. The {{preparations}} were a well kept secret; {{the first}} thing that had to be sorted is where <b>would</b> <b>she</b> stay. Meath hunted the best hounds and Summerhill was centrally located, so Summerhill was chosen. When she was on one hunt in Dunshaughlin, as they came to Maynooth, they came across two men repairing a demesne wall of the Catholic seminary. As the deer they were hunting jumped into the land of the college, Her Imperial Majesty followed without knowing where she was going and nearly jumped on the President of the college, Professor William Walsh, who later became His Grace The Most Reverend Dr. William Walsh, Lord Primate of Ireland and Lord Archbishop of Dublin.|$|E

500|$|On 30 June, the [...] "Immortal Seven" [...] {{secretly}} requested William—then in the Dutch Republic with Mary—to come to England with an army to depose James. William {{had made}} known earlier that a military intervention, {{for which he}} had been assembling forces, would be conditional on such an invitation. At first, William was still reluctant; possibly he was jealous of his wife's position as the heiress to the English Crown and feared she would become more powerful than he was. According to Gilbert Burnet, however, Mary convinced her husband that she did not care for political power, and told him [...] "she would be no more but his wife, and that she would do all that lay in her power to make him King for life". She <b>would,</b> <b>she</b> assured him, always obey her husband as she had promised to do in her marriage vows.|$|E

500|$|Although Chloe {{appeared}} {{alongside her}} television cohorts in the Smallville comic books, which featured tie-ins to the Chloe Chronicles webisodes, DC writers hoped to bring Chloe into DC continuity {{at least as}} early as 2007. The character ultimately made her first appearance in the mainstream [...] in 2010. According to writer Kurt Busiek, the problem of bringing Chloe into the mainstream comic book universe, and keeping her television background, was {{that she would have}} filled two roles: [...] "the Girl from Back Home and the Reporter". Those roles were already filled by the adult comic book versions of Lana Lang and Lois Lane, so the plan was to give the character a new background. Busiek hoped to make Chloe the younger sister of someone Clark had gone to school with, who was a now interning at the Daily Planet. Busiek believed that this would make her different from Lana and Lois, but still familiar to readers who also watched the show. Another distinguishing feature would be that this version of Chloe would not know Clark's secret, nor <b>would</b> <b>she</b> be meteor infected. These ideas never came to fruition.|$|E
500|$|Filmmaker Walt Disney {{himself had}} first {{attempted}} {{to adapt the}} Brothers Grimm fairy tale [...] "Rapunzel" [...] into a feature-length animated film during the 1930s. However, he abandoned the project because the story was considered too [...] "small." [...] When they were approached to direct Tangled in 2008, directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard decided {{that it would be}} best to update the story [...] "for a modern audience", soon discovering [...] "that the problem with having a prison character ... is that they don't have anyone to talk to." [...] Howard explained that because Rapunzel is incapable of having a decent conversation with Mother Gothel, the isolated, incarcerated heroine [...] "needed someone to relate to." [...] Unwilling to default to using the traditional [...] "boring, ordinary side-kick," [...] Greno and Howard created Pascal, conceiving the character as a chameleon because Rapunzel is, according to Greno, [...] "a rough-and-tumble girl." [...] Howard explained that [...] "we wanted to do ... something fresh, something different. This girl, she's not a dainty, precious girl ... So what <b>would</b> <b>she</b> have? ... She's going to have a lizard." [...] Additionally, Howard believed that a reptile would compliment Rapunzel's personality best, describing the character as [...] "a quirky pet for a quirky young woman." ...|$|E
500|$|Jenijoy La Belle takes a {{slightly}} different view in her article, [...] "A Strange Infirmity: Lady Macbeth’s Amenorrhea." [...] La Belle states that Lady Macbeth does not wish for just a move away from femininity; she is asking the spirits to eliminate the basic biological characteristics of womanhood. The main biological characteristic that La Belle focuses on is menstruation. La Belle argues that by asking to be [...] "unsex" [...] and crying out to spirits to “make thick [...] blood / Stop up th’ access and passage to remorse,” Lady Macbeth asks for her menstrual cycle to stop. By having her menstrual cycle stop, Lady Macbeth hopes to stop any feelings of sensitivity and caring {{that is associated with}} females. She hopes to become like a man to stop any sense of remorse for the regicide. La Belle furthers her argument by connecting the stopping of the menstrual cycle with the persistent infanticide motifs in the play. La Belle gives examples of [...] "the strangled babe" [...] whose finger is thrown into the witches’ cauldron (4.1.30); Macduff’s babes who are [...] "savagely slaughter’d" [...] (4.3.235); and the suckling babe with boneless gums whose brains Lady Macbeth would dash out (1.7.57–58) to argue that Lady Macbeth represents the ultimate anti-mother: not only <b>would</b> <b>she</b> smash in a baby’s brains but she would go even further to stop her means of procreation altogether.|$|E

The only certainty {{to be drawn from}} it was, that nothing decisive had yet taken place. Edmund had not yet spoken. How Miss Crawford really felt, how she meant to act, or might act without or against her meaning; whether his importance to her were quite what it had been before the last separation; whether, if lessened, it were likely to lessen more, or to recover itself, were subjects for endless conjecture, and to be thought of on that day and many days to come, without producing any conclusion. The idea that returned the oftenest was that Miss Crawford, after proving herself cooled and staggered by a return to London habits, would yet prove herself in the end too much attached to him to give him up. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> try to be more ambitious than her heart <b>would</b> allow. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> hesitate, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> tease, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> condition, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> require a great deal, but <b>she</b> <b>would</b> finally accept.|$|R

[...] She continued, [...] "There was this constant spectrum of conversation with Mark Mylod during the chase of about how petrified she needs to look, but also how safe she is. Arya's been very lucky with the people she's encountered so far. The whole time she was with The Hound she took a back seat because he was really good. So I wanted her to look like she was struggling." [...] Williams also stated that she gave input on how the scene should take place, stating [...] "I didn't want the chase stunt to be unnecessary or superhuman. I got on set {{and they were going to}} have Arya rolling around, and diving, and I was like, [...] "That looks amazing, but no." [...] I'd be like, [...] "Why <b>would</b> <b>she</b> run over there? She'd just duck under here and just get out." [...] It doesn’t look quite as cinematic, maybe, but they'll have to find something else if they want cinematic. And I felt awful because the job of the stunt guys is to make everything look as crazy and cool as possible. But I know Arya now. In the beginning it was a lot of guesswork and now I've figured her out." ...|$|E
500|$|EastEnders has {{received}} {{praise for the}} handling of Peggy's breast cancer storyline, as she was a rare media portrayal of an older matriarchal woman with the disease. Older women are at higher risk of being diagnosed; however, in 2001, {{it was reported that}} media representation of breast cancer is skewed towards younger women in their 20s or 30s, as they are seen as [...] "more tragic" [...] or [...] "more sexy" [...] in media terms. A 2000 study by Kitzinger and Henderson showed that 94% of newspaper coverage on non-celebrity women with breast cancer was on those aged under 50. Source organisations working with EastEnders on the storyline have commented: [...] " [...] decided {{it was going to be}} [...] and very rightly so. Bang on, the right age [...] perfect dramatic licence in terms of her sons that she was going to have to share this terrible news with, and how <b>would</b> <b>she</b> share it? Every female would have that problem. How would you tell your children? And they followed that with her. She was exactly the right person." [...] The storyline also received media criticism, for the use of a breast care nurse, who was used to counsel Peggy and translate medical terminology into lay terms for viewers; a character who could provide both a dramatic and educational purpose. However, not all oncology units in the UK offer breast care nurses, and the character presented [...] "particularly positive messages" [...] concerning patient choice and control over treatment options. Because of this, the UK press dubbed the storyline [...] "didactic". The storyline was also criticised because Peggy received her cancer test results after six days, which prompted cancer charities to warn that not all patients would receive the same treatment.|$|E
500|$|Conor Behan of The Independent {{qualified}} {{the clip}} as being [...] "effortlessly sexy". Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone described the video {{for the song}} as the most NSFW from the album. Brent DiCrescenzo of Time Out referred to the clip for [...] "Partition" [...] as a classic MTV video. A more negative review came from The Verge Trent Wolbe who panned Nava's contribution to the album as uninteresting. The Daily Telegraph writer Sarah Crompton stated that the video looked suitable for a porn website and described its imagery as [...] "strip club dressed up as a Busby Berkeley musical". Crompton went on to call the message the video sent [...] "peculiar" [...] and added that the singer should try to become a better role model for young girls. Vivienne Pattison of Mediawatch-uk commented that such visuals showed that Beyoncé had [...] "sold out" [...] and undermined her position as a [...] "role model" [...] and previous [...] "powerful messages that empowered women and girls". In early March 2014, Bill O'Reilly criticized the video for [...] "Partition" [...] during his show The O'Reilly Factor broadcast on Fox News. He said that it represented glorification of sex {{in the back of}} a limousine and offered critique that teenage girls are influenced by the singer, adding, [...] "Why <b>would</b> <b>she</b> do it when she knows the devastation that unwanted pregnancies... and fractured families [...] I think Beyoncé, what she has done here, is inexplicable". In response to these claims, Rutger University's Kevin Allred argues that [...] "Beyonce isn’t sensationalizing her own body and putting it on display for viewers to gawk at. Rather, she performs the historical objectification of black female bodies and replays that objectification in order to point out that, stereotypically, black women have had few means of garnering attention beyond sexual performances. She goes so far as forcing the viewer to be complicit in this objectification by positioning them as the direct viewer of the show she is enacting." [...] The video was nominated in the category for Video of the Year at the 2014 BET Awards. At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards it was nominated in the categories for Best Choreography and Best Female Video.|$|E
