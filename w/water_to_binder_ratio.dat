50|$|A {{pozzolanic}} {{material is}} by definition capable of binding calcium hydroxide {{in the presence of}} water. Therefore, the chemical measurement of this pozzolanic activity represents a way of evaluating pozzolanic materials. This can be done by directly measuring the amount of calcium hydroxide a pozzolan consumes over time. At high <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>binder</b> <b>ratio</b> (suspended solutions), this can be measured by titrimety or by spectroscopic techniques. At lower water to binder ratios (pastes), thermal analysis or X-ray powder diffraction techniques are commonly used to determine remaining calcium hydroxide contents. Other direct methods have been developed that aim to directly measure the degree of reaction of the pozzolan itself. Here, selective dissolutions, X-ray powder diffraction or scanning electron microscopy image analysis methods have been used.|$|E

40|$|The {{chloride}} {{diffusion coefficient}} {{is considered to}} be a key factor for evaluating the service life of ground-granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) blended concrete. The chloride diffusion coefficient relates to both the concrete mixing proportions and curing ages. Due to the continuous hydration of the binders, the capillary porosity of the concrete decreases and the chloride diffusion coefficient also decreases over time. To date, the dependence of chloride diffusivity on the binder hydration and curing ages of slag-blended concrete has not been considered in detail. To fill this gap, this study presents a numerical procedure to predict time-dependent chloride diffusion coefficients for slag-blended concrete. First, by using a blended cement hydration model, the degree of the binder reaction for hardening concrete can be calculated. The effects of the <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>binder</b> <b>ratios</b> and slag replacement ratios on the degree of the binder reaction are considered. Second, by using the degree of the binder reaction, the capillary porosity of the binder paste at different curing ages can be determined. Third, by using the capillary porosity and aggregate volume, the chloride diffusion coefficients of concrete can be calculated. The proposed numerical procedure has been verified using the experimental results of concrete with different <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>binder</b> <b>ratios,</b> slag replacement ratios, and curing ages...|$|R

40|$|After being {{subjected}} to high temperatures, the residual properties of pulverized fly ash (PFA) concrete have been investigated. Both mechanical and durability properties of concrete were tested on concretes made with different <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>binder</b> <b>ratios</b> and PFA contents. Microscopic techniques were then employed and the pore structure and microhardness values of hardened cement paste (hcp) were determined. The results of rapid chloride diffusion tests revealed that concrete durability deterioration commences after exposure to temperatures which are lower than those at which compressive strength deterioration commences. The rise in compressive strength, which occurs after exposure to 250 °C, may be {{largely due to the}} hardening of cement paste caused by drying and the further hydration of cementitious materials. The simultaneous loss of durability, however, can be explained by a weakened transition zone between hcp and aggregate, and by the concurrent coarsening of the hcp pore structure. When PFA is included, an improvement of fire resistance as characterized by the residual compressive strength was observed, and this relative improvement over non-PFA concrete was the most pronounced for maximum exposure temperatures of 450 °C and 650 °C.

40|$|In {{engineering}} practise, interior {{relative humidity}} (RH) of concrete significantly affects the transport properties {{and thus the}} service life of concrete structures. In this paper, the development of RH due to self-desiccation in blended cement pastes was studied from 1 day to 1. 5 years. The pore structure and non-evaporable water content at same ages were determined by mercury intrusion porosimetry and thermogravimetric analysis, respectively. The results revealed that interior RH was significantly reduced at the first 105 days’ curing and falls off slightly afterwards, regardless of <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>binder</b> <b>ratios</b> and type of blends. Compared to ordinary Portland cement (OPC) paste, the OPC paste blended with slag shows much lower interior RH, whereas the addition of fly ash slightly increases the interior RH. Minor amount of limestone addition i. e., 5 % wt. greatly increases the RH in ternary system consisting of OPC, slag and limestone, whilst slightly decreases the RH in OPC paste blended with fly ash. In the presence of blends, high total porosity corresponds to low interior RH. In case of self-desiccation, it is concluded that interior RH is mainly controlled by average pore size in the cement-based materials. Materials and Environmen...|$|R
