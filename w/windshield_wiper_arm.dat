50|$|For the Today's early-1996 facelift, Honda {{eliminated}} the tailgate rear door, {{and replaced it}} with a traditional hatchback door. This necessitated some redesign in the rear end, because the rear window had originally wrapped around to the sides. One characteristic shared with both generations was the use of only one <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> <b>arm</b> for the front windshield due to the vehicles small dimensions.|$|E
5000|$|Racing {{equipment}} includes tubular exhaust headers, {{an electric}} fuel pump, altered rear suspension with heavy-duty traction control bars and asymmetrical leaf springs, heavy-duty trunk-mounted battery, locking differential, auxiliary gauges, special drag race wheels and tires supplied both by Goodyear and Mickey Thompson (himself {{a recipient of}} one of the first ten cars) and an aluminum scatter shield designed to contain the clutch in case of disintegration under load. The claimed compression ratio was 13.5:1. Other weight-saving measures include the elimination of such street items as the sunvisors, radio, heater, wheel covers, passenger side <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper,</b> <b>arm</b> rests, rear window cranks, mirrors, sound deadening material, carpeting, trunk mat, lug wrench, jack and spare tire. Front seats were either lightweight units from Ford's police package vehicles or rudimentary bucket seats from the Econoline van; the carpeting was replaced with a black rubber mat. The rear seat was a standard Fairlane unit. The high-beam headlights were eliminated as well and in their place were mesh-covered air intakes which ran directly to a special air cleaner atop the 427. Like the street version, the Thunderbolt's outer high-low 5.75 inch (146 mm) headlights of the type normally used with a four-lamp system were selectable with a standard foot-operated switch. Though it was technically a street legal automobile, these modifications and deletions along with a final drive ratio of 4:57.1 for the four-speed cars and 4:44.1 for the automatics make the Thunderbolt impractical for street use.|$|E

5000|$|Changes for 1968 were {{relatively}} subtle. The park and turn {{lights in the}} grille were moved slightly inboard and made round. Side marker lights {{were added to the}} front fenders and rear quarter panels, to comply with newly introduced Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108. Shoulder harnesses (separate, this year and until 1973, from the lap belts) and non-glare matte finish on the <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> <b>arms</b> were also part of the 1968 federally mandated safety package. Chrysler's [...] "Clean Air Package" [...] emission control system became standard equipment on cars sold in all 50 states. The steering linkage was revised again, as were the windshield and rear window gaskets and trim-lock strips, leaving the 1967 pieces as one-year-only items. The standard rear axle ratio was dropped from 2.93 to 2.76 with all standard-performance engines and automatic transmission. Part-throttle downshift functionality was added as a refinement to the TorqueFlite automatic transmission in 6-cylinder cars, to retain acceptable city performance with the taller rear axle ratio.|$|R

40|$|December 2004. "Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf 18) As {{part of a}} field operational test, 96 {{drivers were}} lent instrumented vehicles for approximately 26 days. During this time, a variety of measures regarding vehicle use were recorded, including <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> use, wiper setting adjustments, and headway time margin to preceding vehicles. <b>Windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> activity was examined in detail {{in order to provide}} data regarding the naturalistic use of <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> systems. The results have implications for the design and durability of <b>windshield</b> <b>wipers,</b> <b>wiper</b> motors, <b>windshields,</b> and glazing treatments (such as hydrophobic coatings). Overall, <b>windshield</b> <b>wipers</b> were used 8. 6 % of the time the vehicles were being operated. Across all conditions, the slowest intermittent setting was the most frequently used—whereas the fastest continuous setting was used the least. When ambient lighting diminished, a shift towards higher wiper speeds was observed. Average headway time margin and range increased, and speed decreased, when <b>windshield</b> <b>wipers</b> were engaged. Middle-aged drivers used wipers more often than either their younger or older counterparts. Finally, older females used their wipers the least amongst female drivers, while male drivers used wipers fairly uniformly across age groups...|$|R
