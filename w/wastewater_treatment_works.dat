25|$|The Derwent starts {{its course}} at Lilla Rig on the North York Moors {{a few miles}} from the east coast of Yorkshire. After {{collecting}} the waters of the Jugger Howe Beck, Black Beck and Troutdale Beck it flows south through the Forge Valley to West Ayton. From there it continues across lower ground to where it is joined by the River Hertford. The Sea Cut, a man made channel, connects the Derwent to the North Sea near Scarborough to alleviate flooding in the lower reaches of the Derwent, downstream of the Cut. This management area is about 127km² and largely rural with no major settlements. Corallian limestone lies beneath this area. The landscape is upland moors in the upper reaches with lower lying flatter land near Hackness. The river flows through the narrow Forge Valley and several designated natural conservation sites. Water is retained behind a weir at West Ayton and there are sink holes in the river bed where river water is lost to underlying aquifers, so that in drought years the river below the weir may run dry. There are no <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>works.</b> The ecology and fisheries have a very high sensitivity to changes in water flow.|$|E
25|$|Standards are set {{for sewage}} sludge {{generated}} or treated by publicly owned and privately owned treatment works that treat domestic sewage and municipal wastewater. Materials flushed in household drains through sinks, toilets and tubs {{are referred to}} as domestic wastewater and include components of soaps, shampoos, human excrement, tissues, food particles, pesticides, hazardous waste, oil and grease. These domestic wastewaters are treated at the source in septic tanks, cesspools, portable toilets, or in publicly/privately owned <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>works.</b> Alternately, municipal wastewater treatments consist of more levels of treatment that provide greater wastewater cleanup with larger amounts of sewage sludge. Primary municipal treatment remove solids that settle at the bottom, generating more than 3,000 liters of sludge per million liters of wastewater that is treated. Primary sludge water content is easily reduced by thickening or removing water and contains up to 7% solids. Secondary municipal treatment process produces sewage sludge that is generated by biological treatment processes that include activated sludge systems, trickling filters, and other attached growth systems. Microbes are used to break down and convert organic substances in wastewater to microbial residue in biological treatment processes. This process removes up to 90% of organic matter and produces sludge that contains up to 2% solids and has increased generated volumes of sludge. Methods of use and disposal of sewage sludge include the following: Application of sludge to agricultural and non-agricultural lands; sale or give-away of sludge for use in home gardens; disposal of sludge in municipal landfills, sludge-only landfills, surface disposal sites and incineration of sludge. Managing quality of sewage sludge not only involves wastewater reduction and separation of contaminated waste from non-contaminants but also pretreatment of non-domestic wastewater. Pretreatment does not thoroughly reduce pollutants level and therefore communities have to dispose rather than use sludge.|$|E

[...] This study verified laboratory etc. work published earlier by other workers. [...] They found there was no increase in wastewater treatment works' cost, nor the volume of wastewater but that there was a 46% increase in biogas.|$|E

OBJECTIVES: We assessed the contribution of estrogens to adverse health effects induced in a model fish species by exposure to WwTW effluents and compared effects of an estrogen alone {{and as part of}} a complex mixture (i. e., spiked into effluent). METHODS: Growth, genotoxic, immunotoxic, metabolic, and endocrine (feminized) responses were compared in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) exposed for 21 days to a potent estrogenic effluent, a weakly estrogenic effluent before and after spiking with a steroidal estrogen [17 α-ethinylestradiol (EE 2) ], and to EE 2 alone. RESULTS: In addition to endocrine disruption, effluent exposure induced genotoxic damage, modulated immune function, and altered metabolism; many of these effects were elicited in a sex-specific manner and were proportional to the estrogenic potencies of the effluents. A key finding was that some of the responses to EE 2 were modified when it was present in a complex mixture (i. e., spiked into effluent), suggesting that mixture effects may not be easily modeled for effluent discharges or when the chemicals impact on a diverse array of biological axes. CONCLUSION: These data reveal a clear link between estrogens present in effluents and diverse, adverse, and sex-related health impacts.
