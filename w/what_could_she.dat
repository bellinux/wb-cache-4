6000|$|I {{followed}} her blindly to the bedside, little guessing <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> mean. <b>She</b> knelt {{down at the}} head of the cot. The girl's eyes were closed. I touched her cheek; she was in a high fever. [...] "Temperature?" [...] I asked.|$|R
6000|$|There was a dull, hopeless ring {{about her}} voice that awoke his curiosity. For <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> have wanted the money, {{and why did}} she no longer want it? ...|$|E
