The purpose of this paper is to examine ways to increase the funds thus <b>widening</b> <b>investment</b> channels and diversifying investment so that the real estate industry can establish itself.

50|$|These {{recommendations}} were {{high on the}} agenda of the newly elected government of Harold Wilson. But the pace of change was to be slow. Officials at the Bank of England, with the support of Sir Athelstan Caröe, then chairman of the Trustee Savings Banks Association, called {{for the establishment of a}} strong central authority to assume many of the control powers vested in the Government, bearing in mind the need to build up adequate capital reserves virtually from scratch.

500|$|Prior to the 1961 Act, {{the areas}} {{trustees}} could invest in {{were based on}} the Trustee Act 1925, which set up a [...] "Statutory Lists" [...] system. The list contained only those investments available at the Post Office, along with land. It did {{not take into account the}} deprecation of currency or inflation, meaning that if the trustees invested in stocks and shares they were at risk of losing money simply because of the falling value of the pound sterling. As a result, even though the income from a trust might remain nominally constant, the real value of that income could be much reduced over the lifetime of the trust. This was recognised by lawyers, who had been advising their clients to structure trusts in such a way as to allow their trustees to invest in wider areas than the Statutory Lists. In 1952 the report of the Nathan Committee advocated reform, and the government published a White Paper on [...] "Government Policy on Charitable Trusts in England and Wales" [...] in 1955, which proposed a reform of the Statutory Lists system. This came about under the Variation of Trusts Act 1958, which allowed trustees to apply to the courts to <b>widen</b> their <b>investment</b> powers, a process that was expensive and slow.|$|R

40|$|The open {{character}} of the Belgian economy is also reflected in its financial relations with other countries. At the end of 2007, Belgium’s net foreign assets totalled around 44. 4 p. c. of GDP. In the past decade, Belgium’s net financial assets have shown a marked increase, {{against the backdrop of}} the introduction of the common currency and the progressive financial integration and globalisation. The degree to which the various non-financial sectors have responded to these developments varies greatly between sectors. The public sector is the one which has done most to adjust its financing and seen the biggest rise in the share of the rest of the world in its total debt, namely from 20 p. c. at the end of 1997 to around 46 p. c. at the end of 2007. When the euro was introduced on the financial markets, it was imperative for the Treasury to <b>widen</b> its <b>investment</b> base : appropriate diversification of the corps of Primary Dealers and Recognised Dealers was one of the ways in which it achieved that. Non-financial corporations, which traditionally maintain very close international financial contacts, still saw a steady increase in the share of the rest of the world in their financial transactions between 1997 and 2007 : during that period, in the case of financial liabilities, the figure was up from 24 p. c. at the end of 1997 to over 37 p. c. at the end of 2007; for financial assets, the share was up from 28 p. c. to 39 p. c. However, these orders of magnitude are subject to a strong upward influence exerted by the coordination centres based in Belgium, which perform the function of a financial intermediary for the multinational group to which they are attached. In the past decade, there have been frequent exchanges of shareholdings between Belgian and foreign companies, reflecting the process of mergers and acquisitions, and these have also contributed to the growth of direct investment between Belgium and the rest of the world. Another point worth mentioning is that the past decade has brought a strong rise in loans granted by foreign financial institutions as a percentage of total bank lending to Belgian firms : that figure increased from 12 p. c. at the end of 1997 to 35 p. c. at the end of 2007. The share of foreign assets in the household portfolio dropped from 30 p. c. at the end of 1997 to 17 p. c. at the end of 2007. Naturally, that is due partly to the introduction on 1 July 2005 of the European directive on the taxation of savings; it has now ceased to be possible for individuals to avoid the tax on income from interest-bearing assets held in other countries, and that has ultimately led to the repatriation of those assets. In contrast, in the case of non interest-bearing assets, foreign investment flows increased between 1997 and 2007. Finally, it should be pointed out that the share of the rest of the world in the liabilities of households is still negligible. flow of funds, financial flow...|$|R
40|$|The {{covered warrant}} {{market in the}} UK has gained in {{popularity}} over time since first launched in 2002. This has opened up an alternative investment choice which offers derivative securities with a life of typically one to two years. It seems to fulfill many of the functions of a traded options market. Since most research {{has been focused on}} options trading, the investigation on covered warrants trading is still very limited. This is also largely {{due to the lack of}} readily available data for end-traded covered warrants and the existing covered warrants. A unique set of hand-collected data, supplemented by public and private data from main covered warrants issuer and the financial database are employed, making this thesis possible. The sample periods can be divided into two separate sets. The UK covered warrants trading during the period July 2004 - December 2006 are used to examine the impact of warrant introduction and expiration on the price, volume and volatility of the underlying securities. For the introduction analyses, both the announcement and listing of covered warrants have negative impacts on the price of underlying securities for both call and put features, though the impact of the announcement is more pronounced than that of the listing. These affects are temporary and do not persist much beyond the introduction of the warrants. Negative price impacts of the expiration event are also reported for both call and put covered warrants. However, this study finds no significant impacts on the volume of underlying securities trading from the announcement, listing and expiration of call and put covered warrants. Further evidence indicates an increase in volatility of the underlying securities during the announcement and listing of covered warrants. The results hold true for both call and put warrants cases. On the other hand, a decreasing stock volatility is found as a consequence of the expiration of both call and put covered warrants. The second data set involves the call covered warrants traded in the UK market between April 2007 and December 2008; this was analysed for evidence of the best appropriate covered warrants pricing model. This study suggests default risk as a major concern for the warrant price which is called the Vulnerable warrant price. The reasons behind this arise from concern about the issuer’s creditworthiness due to traders’ fraudulent action and the recent subprime problem, the difficulties of dynamic hedging by issuers because of market imperfections, as well as the no guarantees on covered warrant trading provided by the London Stock Exchange. The most salient findings of the study are the following. The Vulnerable warrant price is generally lower than both the Black-Scholes price and warrant market price throughout the warrant’s lifetime. The evidence suggests an overvalued warrant price in the UK market. Moreover, the in-the-money warrants indicate a higher rate of default in comparison to the out-of-the-money warrants. An additional finding shows that the market becomes aware of the default risk only on a short-term basis. The presentation of negative abnormal returns of both market and the Black-Sholes prices support the assumption that default risk is a relevant factor in pricing the UK covered warrants. These findings add to the literature dealing with the effect of derivatives trading on the underlying securities as well as providing more empirical evidence on a particular covered warrant market. This could be of interest not only for practitioners to <b>widen</b> their <b>investment</b> opportunities but also for regulators to have this as a guideline for their future related policies planning.

According to the 6 th State of Logistics Survey for South Africa (2009 : 5), {{logistics}} costs for 2008 reached R 339 billion, equivalent to 14. 7 % of GDP. Transport represents 50. 4 % of these {{logistics costs}} {{compared to a}} world average of 39 %. This major gap between South Africa and the world average shows that there are inefficiencies in this domain that need improvement. This report focuses on the issues faced by the port of Cape Town, the benefits that could be generated by the implementation of an inland port in the Cape Town area and the key success factors for this implementation. The Centre for Supply Chain Management of the University of Stellenbosch created a forecast model for South Africa and expects a demand of over 2. 4 million Twenty-foot Equivalent units (TEUs) in 2039 for the port of Cape Town with a current throughput of 740, 000. In 2012, this capacity will reach 1. 4 million TEUs thanks to an on-going project that includes the <b>widening</b> of berth, <b>investment</b> in equipment, training of operators and a better utilization of the available storage space. The port therefore has {{to find a solution}} to increase a throughput on the long term. Along with capacity, the port is facing other issues such as low productivity, poor infrastructure and congestion in the port area that causes increased delivery time and trucking costs. The inland port has to bring solutions to these issues. Capacity must be addressed with a large piece of land that can accommodate growing volumes and also large investment in equipment and training to increase the productivity and therefore the throughput of the supply chain. In order to decrease congestion in the port area, the inland port has to be located out of the city in an area that can sustain growing traffic. Belcon is a Transnet Freight Rail facility located in Bellville that can offer sufficient storage capacity in a low traffic area. Investments must be made in order to increase its throughput but {{it has the potential to}} absorb a large part of the flows going through the port of Cape Town and a management with the will to develop the inland port concept. At the same time, this inland port is an opportunity to develop intermodal transport for a more sustainable transport system in South Africa. Belcon being a TFR terminal, it is the best location to implement this inland port and offer a competitive intermodal solution for the stakeholders of the South African transport industry...|$|R
