5|$|In 1948, Eric Dingwall, K. M. Goldney and Trevor H. Hall, {{three members}} of the Society for Psychical Research (SPR), two of <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> Price's most loyal associates, {{investigated}} his claims about Borley. Their findings were published in a 1956 book, The Haunting of Borley Rectory, which concluded that Price had fraudulently produced some of the phenomena.|$|E
5|$|The earldom of Suffolk, says {{historian}} Michael Hicks, was 'not particularly well-endowed,' {{probably only}} just scraping the £666 qualifying income for that rank. His mother, though, held substantial estates {{in her own}} right, from her father, Sir Thomas Chaucer. Furthermore, because this was Alice's third marriage, she held large dowers from both previous husbands, the second of <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> Thomas Montagu, 4th Earl of Salisbury.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{influence}} of Frederick II and Christian IV, both of <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> inspired by the castles of France, Dutch and Flemish designers were brought to Denmark, initially to improve the country's fortifications, but increasingly to build magnificent royal castles and palaces in the Renaissance style. In parallel, the half-timbered style became popular for ordinary dwellings in towns and villages across the country.|$|E

5|$|The debtors' section {{consisted}} of a brick barracks, a yard measuring , a kitchen, a public room, and a tap room or snuggery, where debtors could drink as much beer as they wanted, at fivepence a pot in 1815. Philpotts reports that, by the early 19th century, most debtors spent only months in the prison; on 19 April 1826 it held 105 debtors, 99 of <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> there for {{less than six months}} and the other six for less than a year.|$|E
5|$|After half an hour's play Lycett Green {{once again}} became {{convinced}} that Gordon-Cumming was cheating. He left the table and sent a note to his mother-in-law—still at the table—recounting his suspicions: she took no action. By the time the game was finished Mary Wilson, the two Lycett Greens and Stanley Wilson—all of <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> watching Gordon-Cumming closely—were convinced {{that he had been}} cheating, although they differed in their versions of what they saw. Others saw nothing, including people sitting closer to him, such as the prince, Lady Coventry (sitting next to Gordon-Cumming) and Levett (sitting opposite him). Over the two nights' play Gordon-Cumming won a total of £225.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{sometimes}} gruesome testimony {{it was generally}} believed the hearings were politically motivated and that individual excesses could largely be traced only to Lang and Dorcas Williams, both of <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> acting under the orders of a Marine Corps officer who had since been committed to an insane asylum. Both of the accused gendarmerie officers had been indicted by U.S. Navy court-martial prior to the hearings. A separate inquiry conducted by the Haitian government concluded that, outside of 10 killings attributed to Lang and Williams, the gendarmerie's {{conduct of the war}} had been justifiable.|$|E

5|$|Former {{prisoners of}} war were given a high {{priority}} for repatriation back to Australia and discharge. Planning for the recovery of prisoners of the Japanese, most of <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> held in harsh conditions, had begun in 1944 and the 2nd and 3rd Australian Prisoner of War Reception Groups were established at Singapore and Manila respectively in August 1945. By the end of September most of the prisoners recovered from Singapore, Java and Sumatra had been returned to Australia along with about half of those recovered from the Bangkok area. Transport shortages delayed the repatriation of Australian prisoners from Formosa, Japan and Korea, but almost all were on their way home by mid-September.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} events, 91 revolutionaries {{were sentenced to}} exile. Of these, a small group was transported by barges from Giurgiu, {{on their way to}} the Austrian-ruled Svinița, near the Danube port of Orschowa. The revolutionary artist Constantin Daniel Rosenthal and Maria Rosetti, both of <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> allowed to go free and had {{subsequently}} followed the barges on shore, pointed out that the Ottomans had stepped out of their jurisdiction, and were able to persuade the mayor of Svinița to disarm the guards, which in turn allowed the prisoners to flee. The escapees then made their way to Paris.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's first {{constitution}} was ratified on June 10, 1816, {{and the election}} of the first General Assembly took place on August 5 of that year. They convened in the original three-room statehouse located in Corydon. The body consisted of ten senators and twenty-nine representatives, sixteen of <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> signers of the Indiana state constitution. There, the General Assembly began its development into the institution it is today. The original constitution provided that representatives served terms of one year and senators served terms of three years, and permitted an annual meeting of the assembly from December until March.|$|E

Finalists for the three technical awards were announced on 16 August 2010 with winners announced on 1 September, the date on which finalists for 16 'non-technical' categories were revealed. Five 'non-technical' awards were presented without a group of finalists being selected. The awards ceremony took place on 7 October 2010 at Vector Arena, Auckland. Hosted by television presenter Shannon Ryan and comedian Ben Hurley, the ceremony was broadcast on television channel C4.

5|$|The Nazi plan to kill Polish Jews {{from across}} the General Government during Aktion Reinhard was overseen in {{occupied}} Poland by SS-Obergruppenführer Odilo Globocnik, the deputy of Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler in Berlin. The Operation Reinhard camps reported directly to the Reich Main Security Office (German: Reichssicherheitshauptamt or RSHA for short), which was also headed by Himmler. The staff of Operation Reinhard, most of <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> involved in the Action T4 euthanasia programme, used T4 {{as a framework for}} the construction of facilities. All of the Jews who were killed in the Reinhard camps came from ghettos.|$|E
5|$|The North Korean People's Army {{forces were}} {{organized}} into a mechanized combined arms force of ten divisions, originally numbering some 90,000 well-trained and well-equipped troops in July, {{with hundreds of}} T-34 Tanks. However, defensive actions by U.S. and South Korean forces had delayed the North Koreans significantly in their invasion of South Korea, costing them 58,000 of their troops {{and a large number}} of tanks. In order to recoup these losses, the North Koreans had to rely on less experienced replacements and conscripts, many of <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> taken from the conquered regions of South Korea.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, 9 September, {{the party}} visited the races, where the prince's horse won the Clumber Stakes. After dinner the prince once again {{wanted to play}} baccarat {{and asked for a}} chalk line to be drawn on the baize, six inches from the edge, behind which players were to keep their counters when not placing their stake. Edward was banker and Williams acted as the croupier. When Gordon-Cumming arrived at the table, there were only two vacant seats. At either of them, Gordon-Cumming would be surrounded by members of the Wilson family, all of <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> informed of Stanley and Levett's suspicions.|$|E
5|$|The women's {{skeleton}} {{event at}} the 2010 Winter Olympics {{took place at the}} Whistler Sliding Centre on 18–19 February. The competition was won by British athlete Amy Williams, who set new course records for the track on her first and third runs. Williams, who had never before won a World Cup or World Championship event, became the first British athlete to win a solo Winter Olympic gold medal in 30 years. German sliders Kerstin Szymkowiak and Anja Huber won the silver and bronze medals respectively. Williams' teammate Shelley Rudman, who had won the silver medal at the 2006 Winter Olympics, and Canadian Mellisa Hollingsworth, both of <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> expected to be in medal contention, were disappointed.|$|E

Unlicensed DVDs containing the first nine episodes of Underbelly were seized in a raid by police on a business in Melbourne's western suburbs on 11 March 2008. The 41-year-old man arrested faced charges of copyright infringement and of breaking the court order banning broadcast {{of the program in}} Victoria. Along with the Underbelly DVDs, more than 7000 other unlicensed DVDs were uncovered, as well as eight printers and 70 new DVD burners. The group of ingringers contained several members, some of <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> arrested for offences in the months prior.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} 2008 {{supplemental}} {{draft in}} late June, Layla was drafted to the Raw brand. On the 7 July episode of Raw, Layla made her debut in a tag team match with Jillian Hall, losing to Mickie James and Kelly Kelly, the latter of <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> revealed as {{the newest member of}} the Raw brand earlier that night. She soon entered a storyline with Jamie Noble in which Noble attempted to impress her with his matches, only to be squashed by his opponents. On 1 September, Noble was able to defeat William Regal, which impressed Layla. The following week, however, Layla chose to align herself with Regal, after he defeated Noble in a rematch. On the following episode of Raw, Layla reinforced her decision, telling Noble that she had finally found a worthy man in Regal. Over the next few months, Layla competed only sporadically in matches, spending most of her time managing Regal, and was present at ringside when Regal defeated Santino Marella on 10 November to win the WWE Intercontinental Championship. On 5 April, Layla competed in a Divas battle royal at WrestleMania XXV, but the match was won by Santina Marella.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time the attack on the city would mark {{the first time that the}} revolutionary army would confront federal forces in a regular battle rather than relying on guerrilla tactics. While the fusion of Madero's, Villa's and Orozco's men did result in a number of troops {{sufficient}} to form a force capable of fighting professional soldiers in pitched encounters, the federal troops still had the advantage in terms of training and discipline. The government, in fact, had a good chance of squashing the rebels by moving troops down from the state capital of Ciudad Chihuahua and capturing Madero in a pincer movement. However, the Díaz-appointed governor of the state, Miguel Ahumada, was worried that if the soldiers abandoned the capital unrest would break out and the insurrection would spread. As a further sign of the apparent demoralization of federal rank-and-file soldiers (many of <b>whom</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> forcibly conscripted and actually sympathized with the revolutionaries), the troops in Ciudad Chihuahua decided to stay put.|$|E
