5000|$|The first Test in Dubai was Pakistan's 400th Test {{match and}} the second day/night Test. Prior {{to the start of}} the day/night Test, both captains voiced their support for the format. Pakistan's captain Misbah-ul-Haq said [...] "At the moment, it looks like (the future) keeping in mind the {{interest}} of the audience, who want to <b>watch</b> <b>Test</b> cricket". The West Indies captain Jason Holder said that he liked the concept and that [...] "we have to give a chance to something new". However, at the start of the first day of the Test, only 68 fans were inside the stadium, with the figure growing to approximately 600 by close of play. Pakistan's coach Mickey Arthur said after the conclusion of the day/night Test that [...] "there's some work to do with the pink ball. I don't think it's up to the standard required yet and I think that's the only thing holding day/night cricket back".|$|E
40|$|Objectives: {{to raise}} the {{diagnosis}} of elderly nursing in nursing consultation and relate those diagnostics {{with the results of}} neurological test. Method: a documental research with 8 elderly of age or older than 60 years old of the program participants of health care of elderly and diagnosed with alzheimer's disease. There were used forms of consultations of nursing, and neurological and cognition tests between may to october 2011; they were statistically treated and with cep no. 0239. 0. 258. 000 - 11. Results: the nursing diagnosis was the chronic confusion with test results for evaluation of immediate memory, incidental and late. Risk of falls was related to the <b>watch</b> <b>test.</b> Poor knowledge was related to recognition of figures and evaluation of learning. Standard prejudiced sleep, risk of solitude and chronic sadness helped to diagnose depression. Conclusion: this work allowed establishing relationship between nursing diagnosis with neurology for planning of nursing care...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the {{cross-cultural}} adaptation of the Edmonton Frail Scale (EFS) and its validity in a Brazilian elderly sample. Translation and back-translation were performed, as well as discussion with professionals and elderly for conceptual equivalence, semantic validation and pre-test of the scale. The scale was applied to 137 elderly aged 65 years or older {{who lived in the}} community. In the know-groups validation of the frailty diagnosis between gender, age and cognitive deficit, elder elderly, female and with a cognitive deficit scored higher on the frailty diagnosis. A negative convergent correlation was found between the EFS and the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) (- 0. 53, p< 0. 01) and the total score of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (- 0. 60, p< 0. 01). The <b>watch</b> <b>test</b> presented high sensitivity and low specificity levels. The Portuguese version of the EFS was considered valid in the study sample...|$|E

5000|$|The term {{chronometer}} {{was coined}} from the Greek words chronos (meaning time) and meter (meaning counter) in 1714 by Jeremy Thacker, an early competitor for the prize {{set by the}} Longitude Act in the same year. It has recently become more commonly used to describe <b>watches</b> <b>tested</b> and certified to meet certain precision standards.

500|$|As the {{laboratory}} took shape, McMillan became deputy {{head of the}} gun-type nuclear weapon effort under Navy Captain William S. Parsons, an ordnance expert. The plutonium gun, codenamed Thin Man, needed a muzzle velocity of at least [...] per second, which they hoped to achieve with a modified Navy 3-inch antiaircraft gun. The alternative was to build an implosion-type nuclear weapon. McMillan took an early interest in this, <b>watching</b> <b>tests</b> of this concept conducted by Seth Neddermeyer. The results were not encouraging. Simple explosions resulted in distorted shapes. John von Neumann looked at the implosion program in September 1943, and proposed a radical solution involving explosive lenses. This would require expertise in explosives, and McMillan urged Oppenheimer to bring in George Kistiakowsky. Kistiakowsky joined {{the laboratory}} on February 16, 1944, and Parsons's E (Explosives) Division was divided in two, with McMillan as deputy for the gun and Kistiakowsky as deputy for implosion.|$|R

50|$|The {{standards}} for diving watches are {{regulated by the}} ISO 6425 international standard. The <b>watches</b> are <b>tested</b> in static or still water under 125% of the rated (water) pressure, thus a watch with a 200 m rating will be water resistant if it is stationary and under 250 m of static water. The testing of the water resistance is fundamentally different from non-dive watches, because every watch has to be fully tested.|$|R

The <b>watches</b> under <b>test</b> shall {{be subjected to}} an overpressure in water of 125% of the rated pressure for 10 minutes and to an external force of 5 N perpendicular to the crown and pusher buttons (if any).

5000|$|Water-tightness and {{resistance}} at a water overpressure. The <b>watches</b> under <b>test</b> shall be immersed in water {{contained in a}} suitable vessel.

Subsequently, the overpressure shall be reduced to 0.3 bar within 1 minute and maintained at this pressure for 1 hour. The watches shall then {{be removed from the}} water and dried with a rag. No evidence of water intrusion or condensation is allowed.|$|R

The Breitling Navitimer Cosmonaute was designed with a 24-hour analog dial to avoid confusion between AM and PM, which are meaningless in space. It was first worn in space by U.S. astronaut Scott Carpenter on 24 May 1962 in the Aurora 7 mercury capsule.|$|R
