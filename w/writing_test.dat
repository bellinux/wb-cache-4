2500|$|ACT, Inc. {{says that}} the ACT {{assessment}} measures high school students' general educational development and their capability to complete college-level work with the multiple choice tests covering four skill areas: English, mathematics, reading, and science. [...] The optional <b>Writing</b> <b>Test</b> measures skill in planning and writing a short essay. Specifically, ACT states that its scores provide an indicator of [...] "college readiness," [...] and that scores {{in each of the}} subtests correspond to skills in entry-level college courses in English, algebra, social science, humanities, and biology. [...] According to a research study conducted by ACT, Inc., in 2003, a relationship was found between a student's ACT composite score and the possibility of his or her earning a college degree.|$|E
2500|$|The {{required}} {{portion of}} the ACT is divided into four multiple choice subject tests: English, mathematics, reading, and science reasoning. Subject test scores range from 1 to 36; all scores are integers. The English, mathematics, and reading tests also have subscores ranging from 1 to 18 (the subject score is not {{the sum of the}} subscores). [...] The composite score is the average of all four tests. In addition, students taking the optional <b>writing</b> <b>test</b> receive a writing score ranging from 2 to 12 (This is a change from the previous 1–36 score range). The writing score does not affect the composite score. The ACT has eliminated the combined English/writing score, and has added two new combined scores: The ELA will be an average of the English, Reading and Writing scores. The STEM will be an average of the Math and Science scores. All of the changes that have been listed for the writing score and the new ELA and STEM scores were effective starting on the September 2015 test.|$|E

2500|$|The ACT ( [...] ; {{originally}} an abbreviation of American College Testing) college readiness {{assessment is}} a standardized test {{for high school}} achievement and college admissions in the United States produced by ACT, a nonprofit organization of the same name. It was first administered in November 1959 by Everett Franklin Lindquist as a competitor to the College Board's Scholastic Aptitude Test, now the SAT. The ACT originally consisted of four tests: English, Mathematics, Social Studies, and Natural Sciences. In 1989 however, the Social Studies test was changed into a Reading section (which included a Social Studies subsection) and the Natural Sciences test was renamed the Science Reasoning test, with more emphasis on problem solving skills. In February 2005, an optional <b>Writing</b> <b>test</b> {{was added to the}} ACT, mirroring changes to the SAT that took place later in March of the same year. In 2013, ACT announced that students would be able to take the ACT by computer starting in the spring of 2015. The test will continue to be offered in the paper format for schools that are not ready to transition to computer testing.|$|E

The tests are designed to reflect actual English usage in the workplace, though they do not require any knowledge of specialized business terms. The TOEIC Speaking Test takes approximately 20 minutes to complete; the TOEIC <b>writing</b> <b>test</b> lasts approximately 60 minutes. Each test has a score range between 0-200, with test takers grouped into eight proficiency levels.|$|E
