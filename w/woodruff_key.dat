5000|$|Woodruff {{keys are}} semi{{circular}}, fitting partly into a circular segment keyway {{with the remainder}} fitting into a longitudinal slot keyway in the mating part. The circular segment can be cut directly by plunge cutting with a circular Woodruff cutter without any reliefs. The main advantage of the <b>Woodruff</b> <b>key</b> is the elimination of milling near shaft shoulders, where stress concentrations, and concentricity would be affected. [...] The latter is particularly important for high speed operation. The more exact fit of the key and keyway also reduces play, and stress concentrations in, and improves {{the reliability of the}} key. Common applications include machine tools, automotive applications, snowblowers and marine propellers.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 1877, Woodruff was {{the first}} {{president}} of the St. George Temple. This {{was the first}} temple in which the endowment ordinances were performed for the dead {{as well as for the}} living. Under the direction of Brigham Young, <b>Woodruff</b> was <b>key</b> in implementing [...] in the temple, in standardizing the ceremonies, and in giving various sermons to encourage broader understanding of the program. Woodruff's main aide in this endeavor was John D. T. McAllister, who served as first counselor in the temple presidency and later succeeded Woodruff as temple president in 1884.|$|R
25|$|From the {{official}} after-action reports for the Battle of Wilson's Creek (Oak Hills), the Pulaski Light Artillery performed like veterans, coolly and professionally. In fact, {{at least one}} regimental commander remarked that <b>Woodruff's</b> battery was <b>key</b> to the Southern victory. Captain Woodruff had {{had the foresight to}} have his battery limbered up, with horses standing in trace, at dawn on August 10. Thus, when the Union batteries opened on the Southern forces, the Pulaski Light Artillery was the first Confederate battery {{to be able to move}} into position, unlimber and open fire. Initially firing counter-battery salvoes to silence the Union guns, Woodruff's battery was then moved to a position to support an assault by Arkansas and Louisiana infantry on the Federal lines.|$|R
40|$|Kenneth Clarkson of IBM Research, {{presented}} {{a lecture on}} April 22, 2011 from 2 : 00 pm - 3 : 00 pm in room 1447 of the Klaus Advanced Computing Building on the Georgia Tech campus. Ken Clarkson is manager of the Computer Science Principles and Methodologies department at Almaden (in San Jose, CA). His work has mostly been on geometric algorithms, in particular {{on the use of}} randomization, for such problems as linear programming, nearest neighbor search in metric spaces, simple polygon triangulation, building compressed quadtrees, and computing convex hulls. Runtime: 56 : 46 minutes. I will describe randomized approximation algorithms for some classical problems of machine learning, where the algorithms have provable bounds that hold with high probability. Some of our algorithms are sublinear, that is, they do not need to touch all the data. Specifically, for a set of points a[subscript 1] [...] . a[subscript n] in d dimensions, we show that finding a d-vector x that approximately maximizes the margin min[subscript i] a[subscript i dot x can be done in O(n+d) /epsilon[superscript 2] time, up to logarithmic factors, where epsilon> 0 is an additive approximation parameter. This was joint work with Elad Hazan and David <b>Woodruff.</b> A <b>key</b> step in these algorithms is the use of coordinate sampling to estimate dot products. This simple technique can be an effective alternative to random projection sketching in some settings. I will discuss the potential of coordinate sampling for speeding up some data structures for nearest neighbor searching in the Euclidean setting, via fast approximate distance evaluations...|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanism}} {{has been}} designed to apply the loads (the stirring and the resection forces and torques) in self-reacted friction stir welding. This mechanism differs somewhat from mechanisms used in conventional friction stir welding, as described below. The tooling needed to apply the large reaction loads in conventional friction stir welding can be complex. Self-reacted friction stir welding has become popular in the solid-state welding community as a means of reducing the complexity of tooling and to reduce costs. The main problems inherent in self-reacted friction stir welding originate in the high stresses encountered by the pin-and-shoulder assembly that produces the weld. The design of the present mechanism solves the problems. The mechanism includes a redesigned pin-and-shoulder assembly. The welding torque is transmitted into the welding pin by a square pin that fits into a square bushing with set-screws. The opposite or back shoulder is held in place by a <b>Woodruff</b> <b>key</b> and high-strength nut on a threaded shaft. The <b>Woodruff</b> <b>key</b> reacts the torque, while the nut reacts the tensile load on the shaft...|$|E
