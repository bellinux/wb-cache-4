5|$|The Yakamas {{also have}} a legend {{attempting}} to explain Adams’ squat appearance. Long ago, the Sun was a man and he had five wives who were mountains: Plash-Plash (the Goat Rocks), Wahkshum (the Simcoe Mountains), Pahto (Adams), Rainier, and St. Helens. Because she was the third wife to be greeted by the Sun in the morning, Pahto became jealous. She broke down both Plash-Plash and Wahkshum, but left Rainier and St. Helens alone. She was happy that she was now {{the first to be}} greeted, but wanted more, so she crossed the Columbia and took plants and animals from the mountains there. The other mountains were afraid of her, but Klah Klahnee (the Three Sisters) convinced Wyeast (Hood) to confront Pahto. Wyeast initially tried being nice, but Pahto would have none of it. So Wyeast hit her head and knocked it off, creating Devils Garden. Wyeast then shared what Pahto had taken {{with the rest of the}} mountains. After this, Pahto became mean and she would send thunderstorms, heavy rain, and snow to the valleys below. The Great Spirit had been <b>watching</b> <b>all</b> this time and came to Pahto. He gave her a new head in the form of White Eagle and his son Red Eagle and he reminded her that she was his daughter. Pahto repented and promised to stop being mean and greedy.|$|E
25|$|Klingons see {{something}} that isn't growing as something that is dying. A Klingon fights not for sport but to gain an advantage for the Empire, for his family and for himself. There {{is a sense of}} paranoia, as others are constantly <b>watching</b> <b>all</b> one's activities in order to seek advancement. This leads to a morality that Federation races see as often cruel and remorseless.|$|E

500|$|Blackburn {{served as}} writer {{on the film}} Vinyan, {{directed}} by Fabrice Du Welz. Vinyan stars Emmanuelle Béart, Rufus Sewell, and Julie Dreyfus. Sky Movies likened Vinyan to Nicolas Roeg's two films Don't Look Now and Heart of Darkness; Blackburn interviewed Roeg in 2008 for Time Out London and noted, [...] "Nic Roeg inspires me." [...] This Is London characterised the film as, [...] "a dark and pessimistic drama which goes slap-happily mad towards the end but keeps you <b>watching</b> <b>all</b> the same." [...] Empire Magazine also compared the film to Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now, and concluded, [...] "Horrific and harrowing but the narrative arc could leave the audience unmoved." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{scene was}} shot of Brandon finding his ward in a poverty-stricken area in London, {{but this was}} {{excluded}} from the film. [...] Thompson's script included a scene of Elinor and Edward kissing, as the studio [...] "couldn't stand the idea of these two people who we've been <b>watching</b> <b>all</b> the way through not kissing." [...] It {{was one of the}} first scenes cut during editing: the original version was over three hours, Lee was less interested in the story's romance, and Thompson found a kissing scene to be inappropriate. The scene was included in marketing materials and the film trailer. Thompson and Doran also cut out a scene depicting Willoughby as remorseful when Marianne is sick. Doran said that despite it [...] "being one of the great scenes in book history," [...] they could not get it to fit into the film.|$|E
500|$|The 17 November 2006 Children in Need charity telethon {{included}} a segment featuring the Holby City cast performing {{a version of}} Hung Up by Madonna. [...] Although the character had not yet made her on-screen debut in the programme, Lewington as Maddy appeared in the sketch - as did fellow newcomers Peter Wingfield (Dan Clifford) and Phoebe Thomas (Maria Kendall) who also had yet to arrive in the show itself. The 16 November 2007 Children in Need appeal again contained a musical performance from Holby City cast members. Lewington, alongside Rakie Ayola (Kyla Tyson) and Phoebe Thomas (Maria Kendall) provided backing vocals for Sharon D Clarke (Lola Griffin), who performed a soul version of Aretha Franklin's signature song, Respect. Lewington said of these appearances: [...] "I had {{the time of my}} life...Woo hoo! Loved every second. Although I was a gibbering wreck before the live performance of 'Respect'. Sharon D Clarke was amazing, not a whisper of fear. I however was convinced that I was going to forget everything and stare blankly into the eyes of 14 million viewers or however many squillions there were <b>watching.</b> <b>All</b> went well though and I've {{got a little bit of}} history in my dvd collection ready for the grand kiddies!"

2500|$|By late 2000, Shaik {{knew that}} the South African Revenue Service (SARS) and the Scorpions would be <b>watching</b> <b>all</b> {{financial}} transactions made between him and Zuma, so the international division of Thomson-CSF sent an encrypted fax to Nkobi Holdings detailing a “service provider agreement" [...] which updated the contract signed between Nkobi Holdings and Thomson-CSF for the delivery of the Corvettes. This agreement was used to disguise the payment of the bribe. The fax, which was later obtained in a raid on Shaik’s office by the Scorpions, contained a non-bribery clause next to which Shaik wrote “conflicts with intention", yet despite the careful set-up, Thomson-CSF did not transfer any money to Shaik. Subsequently, Zuma went to meet with Thétard in Paris, following which R250,000 (US$38,000) was transferred by Thomson-CSF to the “Jacob Zuma Education Fund".|$|E

AMC is going to become something totally different than it once was. It will be all new, all different. Why? I can only conjecture." [...] Thinking of her fellow actors, she later urged viewers not to give up on the show: [...] "Do not stop <b>watching</b> <b>All</b> My Children," [...] McClain stated. [...] "There are some good actors on that show, the producers are trying new and innovative things, and the writers are trying out lots of concepts and ideas that you may ultimately find very entertaining." ...|$|E

2500|$|The film {{begins with}} [...] "1 Nature" [...] at the Nyon {{cultural}} center. A young couple, Marie and her boyfriend, {{are setting up}} a used bookstand. Another couple, Davidson and Isabelle, arrive. By the way that Marie, her boyfriend, and later the character Ivitch address Davidson, it appears {{that he is a}} professor. Brandishing a copy of The Gulag Archipelago, Davidson remarks that its author, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, did not need to use Google to search for the book's subtitle. The professor then asks Isabelle what thumbs used to be for before smartphones, making a punning reference to the French children's story Hop-o'-My-Thumb. He then proceeds to deliver an impromptu lecture on the ideas of Jacques Ellul, such as the abdication of individual rights and responsibilities to the state, a situation that Ellul declared to be the triumph of Adolf Hitler. Abruptly a car drives up, a man gets out and, speaking in German, he accosts Josette, who has been standing nearby. After demanding that she come home (implying that the man is Josette's husband), threatening her with consequences, and trying to physically drag her away, the man retreats out of frame and fires shots from a gun. As the other characters rush to where the shots were fired, the car departs. Josette wanders away, while Gédéon, who has been <b>watching</b> <b>all</b> along, follows her. As Josette washes her hands in a fountain, Gédéon approaches and declares to her, [...] "I am at your service." ...|$|E
