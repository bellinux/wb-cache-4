5|$|Deinosuchus had a {{secondary}} bony palate, {{which would have}} permitted it to breathe through its nostrils <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head remained submerged underwater. The vertebrae were articulated in a procoelous manner, meaning they had a concave hollow {{on the front end}} and a convex bulge on the rear; these would have fit together to produce a ball and socket joint. The secondary palate and procoelous vertebrae are advanced features also found in modern eusuchian crocodilians.|$|E
5|$|Division commander, Major General William F. Dean {{determined}} that the 21st Infantry Regiment was the most combat-ready of the 24th Infantry Division's three regiments. Dean decided to send the 21st Infantry's 1st Battalion from the formation because its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Bradford Smith, was the most experienced leading man, having experience at the Battle of Guadalcanal during World War II. C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft airlifted one battalion from the division garrison under Smith's command into Korea. The battalion deployed quickly to block advancing North Korean forces, performing a holding action <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> division could be moved to South Korea by sea.|$|E

5|$|Following this, the 9th Division was {{tasked with}} {{advancing}} towards Sio, further around the coast {{on the northern}} side of the Huon Peninsula. The Japanese {{in the area around}} Finschhafen were growing in strength, however, as a large number of the 4,000 to 5,000 men that had garrisoned Finschhafen had managed to escape inland, <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th Division, under the command of Lieutenant General Shigeru Katagiri, was being moved from Bogadjim, south of Madang, to provide reinforcements. Wootten considered that the threat posed by this force meant that Sattelberg would have to be captured before the 9th Division could undertake its advance towards Sio.|$|E
5|$|Having already famously played Shylock in Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice on the Yiddish {{stage at}} the People's Theater, he played the role again in a 1903 Broadway production, {{directed}} by Arthur Hopkins. In this production, Adler spoke his lines in Yiddish <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cast spoke in English. The New York Times review of Adler's performance was not favorable: in particular his naturalistic acting style was not what audiences of the period expected in a production of Shakespeare. Some other reviews (such as that in Theater magazine) were friendlier; in any event the same production was revived two years later.|$|E
5|$|In a {{telephone}} interview with Today's Zaman, in 2009, Finkelstein stated:I think Israel, {{as a number of}} commentators pointed out, is becoming an insane state. And we have to be honest about that. <b>While</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world wants peace, Europe wants peace, the US wants peace, but this state wants war, war and war. In {{the first week of the}} massacres, there were reports in the Israeli press that Israel did not want to put all its ground forces in Gaza because it was preparing attacks on Iran. Then there were reports it was planning attacks on Lebanon. It is a lunatic state.|$|E

5|$|In {{the end of}} 1277 Constantine Tikh {{finally took}} {{measures}} to confront the rebels. He gathered a small army and advanced slowly as he had to travel in a chariot because of his injury. Ivaylo attacked and defeated this force, killing many of the emperor's close associates, <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> army joined the rebels. Ivaylo personally slew Constantine Tikh, claiming that the emperor did nothing to keep his honour in the battle. After his triumph, Ivaylo began to seize the country's fortified cities, which surrendered and recognized him as emperor one by one. By the spring of 1278 only the capital Tarnovo remained {{under the control of}} Empress Maria.|$|E
