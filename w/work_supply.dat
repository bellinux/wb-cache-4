5000|$|In general, {{the average}} {{reduction}} in {{work force in}} the US sites was about 13%, {{with most of the}} reduction in labour from secondary (typically the wives) and tertiary (typically older children) earners as opposed to the primary earner (usually the husbands). In Mincome the reduction in work effort was more modest: 1% for men and 3% for wives. It {{is important to remember that}} when the experiments were conducted, it was less socially acceptable for women to work outside the home. According to Rossi and Lyall [...] only 40% of wives who participated in the experiment worked outside the home and their earning power was low due to limited and discontinuous work experience. As such, the authors contend that wives’ labour involvement was marginal and when faced with competing tasks of looking after the household and raising children, the additional income provided by NIT was sufficient to justify an exit from the labor market. However, this phenomenon was predominantly observed in Caucasian wives whereas African American and Hispanic women exhibited a small increase in labor force participation. Interestingly, the decrease in labor involvement of teenage children was correlated to higher rates of high school graduation. A potential explanation is that the additional income from government assistance meant that young adults could stay in school as opposed to join the workforce in order to support their family. This has the potential positive long-term effect of allowing youth to find higher wage employment. In summary, the <b>work</b> <b>supply</b> response to NIT was very complex; however, data from the American studies would argue against a dramatic decline in the labour force.|$|E

40|$|We {{assess the}} actual {{relevance}} of Robbins' paper 'On the elasticity of Demand for Income {{in terms of}} Effort' {{to the theory of}} <b>work</b> <b>supply.</b> First, we show that the paper is the first application of income and substitution effects to this branch of economic research. Next, we analyse Robbins' economic terminology, especially his definition of work. We find that the concept of work he uses could seem vague as he may be considering both the length and intensity dimensions of this activity. To verify this possibility, we formally reassess Robbins' original proposal by introducing this wider definition of work into the mathematical framework he proposes. The resulting model shows that this reading (i) is compatible with his diagrammatic analysis; (ii) clarifies the meaning of the other vague economic concepts the author uses; and (iii) illuminates his verbal explanations. Additionally, we derive all the relevant results of both the income-leisure and the more recent effort-extraction models from this Robbinsian model of <b>work</b> <b>supply.</b> This last outcome allows us to state that Robbins' model comprises current theories of <b>work</b> <b>supply.</b> Copyright (c) 2010 The Author.

40|$|Background: The Centre for drug- and {{addiction}} treatment and Centre {{for learning and}} coping at Oslo University Hospital arrange the course “Mestre Jobben – Mestre Livet”. This course aims to teach life coping mechanisms {{and the ability to}} master a process towards life-style change. Its intent develops from the demonstration that people struggling with dependence on alcohol and/or other substances and maintain an employer-employee relationship {{have a significant effect on}} society in terms of reduced <b>work</b> <b>supply,</b> sick absence, and reduced productivity. However, this population may only occasional attend substance abuse clinic services. Objective: This thesis investigates how participation in “Mestre Jobben – Mestre Livet” has led to a changed <b>work</b> <b>supply,</b> sick leave status and health related quality of life among participants. Method: The method of investigation uses descriptive statistics by comparing group means, correlation analysis and simple regression, and asking if participation has had desirable effects on life change. The data have been collected by a postal survey to all the participants of “Mestre Jobben – Mestre Livet” from the start-up in the fall of 2009 to the spring of 2011. Results: The fraction of participants maintaining a 100 % work position has increased from 60 to 65 %. The study showed no change in sick leave status was found. Results showed that quality of life (indicated by a mental health component scale variable) increased at a group level but is still lower than the score of a normal population. Conclusion: “Mestre Jobben – Mestre Livet” meets criteria which show the aim to be considered fulfilled. Although, because of limitations in the study design alongside limited data, there is some uncertainty related to the strength of these findings...|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] This paper explores {{welfare to}} work policy in the UK and sets out {{ways in which the}} {{delivery}} of that policy could become more efficient and effective by making small but significant changes to the approach. Employers and intermediaries must reposition disability from an issue to do with incapacity, doctors, damage and cost – to one concerned with capability, the workplace and investment in human potential. Employers, disabled people and intermediaries must all engage – and have high expectations of each other. We set out the case for an employer engagement strategy that supports {{welfare to work}} and maximises impact on employer behaviour by: • Repositioning the employer from ‘problem’ and ‘target’ (i. e. people whose attitudes must be changed) to valued ‘end user’, customer and potential partner. • Streamlining the ‘disability to <b>work</b> <b>supply</b> chain’ so that it more efficiently delivers suitable disabled candidates to employers equipped and supported to hire them {{on the basis of their}} capability, to retain them and to develop their potential. We believe it is necessary to reframe the welfare to work challenge as a supply chain challenge and outline 6 fundamental principles that should underpin any welfare to work policy...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} time {{use and the}} incentives to retire that include both the value of paid and domestic work. This is accomplished by documenting the time used in unpaid household work {{in a group of}} EU countries. An economic value is assigned to this time, which is then used to calculate the income replacement rates and the option values for retirement. The study concludes that unpaid work and the possibilities for combining work and domestic life are very important in retirement decisions. The marginal value of non-paid work time has the highest impact in the retirement decision of men, especially among those in good health. Women in good health exhibit continuity of lifetime patterns and their domestic <b>work</b> <b>supply</b> does not increase substantially after retirement. Women in poor health are faced with a dual burden of work, which can explain their withdrawal from the workplace. The combination of these factors (i. e. the dual burden of work) encourages retirement. The policy implication is that economic incentives aimed at postponing retirement may fall short of expectations unless trends in time-use are properly taken into account...|$|E
40|$|Supply chain {{management}} involves the selection, coordination and motivation of independently operated suppliers. However the central planner's perspective in operations management translates poorly to vertically separated chains, where suppliers may have rational myopic reasons {{to object to}} full in- formation sharing and centralized decision rights. Particular problems occur when a downstream coordinator demands relation-specific investments (equipment, cost improvements in processes, adaptation of components to downstream processes, allocation of future capacity etc) from upstream suppliers {{without being able to}} commit to long-term contracts. In practice and theory, this leads of- ten to a phenomenon of either underinvestment in the chain or costly vertical integration to solve the commitment problem. A two-stage supply chain under stochastic demand and information asymmetry is modelled. A repeated investment-production game with coordinator commitment in supplier's investment addresses the information sharing and asset- specific investment problem. We provide a mitigation of the hold-up problem on the investment cost observed by the supplier and an instrument for truthful revelation of private information by using an investment sharing device. We show that there is an interior solution for the investment sharing parameter and discuss some extensions to the <b>work.</b> <b>supply</b> {{chain management}}, investment, information...|$|E
40|$|Supply chain {{simulation}} is a {{very useful}} tool in the decision making process either for implementing a new supply chain or for making changes to an existing one.

Another objective of the work is to analyze the effect of rescheduling frequency on the performance of the supply chain. Order release decisions control the flow of work in a supply chain system. The frequency of these activities and the coordination between various activities in the supply chain has a significant influence on the performance. Three such activities are considered: sourcing of raw materials from the supplier, releasing of orders for production, and releasing of orders for delivery.
