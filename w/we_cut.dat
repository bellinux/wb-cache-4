(which he throws over his shoulder in disgust). Towards the end of the video less privileged children are shown crying at their lack of presents before <b>we</b> <b>cut</b> back to the initial child who is surrounded by gifts while Santa Claus is seen in front of a log fire, crucified on a cross. An alternative ending instead features Santa lying on the floor with an arrow through his head.|$|E
5|$|While {{walking in}} the woods, Andrei and Foma have a {{conversation}} about Foma’s faults, especially lying. Foma confesses to taking honey from the bee garden, after Andrei notices his cassock is tacky, and smears mud on his face to soothe a bee sting. While Foma has talent as an artist, he is less concerned with the deeper meaning of his work and more concerned with practical aspects of the job, like perfecting his azure, a colour which in painting was often considered unstable to mix. They encounter Theophanes in the forest, and the old master sends Foma away. As he leaves, the apprentice finds a dead swan and pokes at it with a stick. <b>We</b> <b>cut</b> to banks of a stream where Andrei and Theophanes are arguing about religion, while Foma cleans his master's paint brushes. Theophanes argues that the ignorance of the Russian people is due to stupidity, while Andrei says that he doesn’t understand how {{he can be a}} painter and maintain such views. This section contains a reenactment of Christ's Crucifixion on a snow-covered hillside which plays out as Andrei recounts the story and expresses his belief that the men who crucified Jesus were obeying God's will and loved him.|$|E

500|$|In post-production, Wan {{found he}} did not have enough shots or takes to work with as he was {{basically}} shooting rehearsals. Having a lot of missing gaps in the final product, he and editor Kevin Greutert created shots to mend together during editing; such as making a shot look like a surveillance camera feed and using still photographs. [...] "We did {{a lot of things to}} fill in gaps throughout the film. Whatever <b>we</b> <b>cut</b> to newspaper clippings and stuff like that, or <b>we</b> <b>cut</b> to surveillance cameras, or <b>we</b> <b>cut</b> to still photography within the film, which now people say, 'Wow, that's such a cool experimental style of filmmaking', we really did that out of necessity to fill in gaps we did not get during the filming," [...] he explained.|$|E

500|$|According to Black, he and {{producer}} James Stroud {{spent more time}} putting this album together than either of those preceding and were [...] "a lot more aggressive in the way <b>we</b> <b>cut</b> and mixed the album". Black was also more satisfied with the vocals on this album. Several of the songs on The Hard Way, including [...] "Burn One Down", were initially reported to be Black's responses to his situation with Ham. [...] Co writer Nicholas refuted the rumors, maintaining {{that most of those}} songs were written in the late 1980s.|$|E
500|$|In another interview, Kramer later gave great {{credit to}} Page {{for the sound}} that was achieved, despite the {{inconsistent}} conditions {{in which it was}} recorded: [...] "We did that album piece-meal. <b>We</b> <b>cut</b> some of the tracks {{in some of the most}} bizarre studios you can imagine, little holes in the wall. Cheap studios. But in the end it sounded bloody marvellous. There was a unification of sound on [...] Zeppelin II because there was one guy in charge and that was Mr. Page." [...] Page and Kramer spent two days mixing the album at A Studios.|$|E
500|$|Years later, showrunner D. B.

[...] Like when <b>we</b> <b>cut</b> Ned’s head off, we didn’t want a gory Monty Python geyser of blood, but we needed to see the blade enter his neck and cut out on the frame where the blade was mid-neck.

500|$|The play {{opened for}} tryouts in New Haven, Connecticut on March 22, 1945. [...] The first act was well-received; {{the second act}} was not. [...] Casto {{recalled}} that the second act finished about 1:30a.m. [...] The staff immediately sat down for a two-hour conference. [...] Five scenes, half the ballet, and two songs were cut from the show as the result. [...] John Fearnley commented, [...] "Now I see why these people have hits. [...] I never witnessed anything so brisk and brave in my life." [...] De Mille said of this conference, [...] "not three minutes had been wasted pleading for something cherished. [...] Nor was there any idle joking.... <b>We</b> <b>cut</b> and cut and cut {{and then we went}} to bed."

[...] He concluded, [...] " [...] 'Tumbling Dice' [...] " [...] was written to fit Keith's riff. It's about gambling and love, an old blues track." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{an effort}} to {{crossover}} with music listeners outside of reggae's market, Sly and Robbie heightened their experimentation with other musical sounds, particularly funk and occasional hip hop music. Despite his eclectic output, Laswell himself had {{started out as a}} bass player in funk groups, an experience that inspired him to compose his musical arrangements with a rhythmic foundation. Dunbar explained their approach for the album in an interview for Musician at the time, saying that [...] "We're trying to get new fans. Once they come into the funk, they're {{going to have to come}} into the reggae, because that's where we're going to take them." [...] Sly and Robbie's direction was also influenced by the supervision of Blackwell who, according to Dunbar, [...] "wanted us to make two tracks, 17 minutes long. So <b>we</b> <b>cut</b> two tracks and extended them, each side consisting of three songs. Non-stop dancing, that's the idea." ...|$|E
500|$|... "East to West" [...] is a {{contemporary}} Christian song lasting four minutes and 26 seconds. It {{was written in}} common time in the key of F minor at a tempo of 73 beats per minute. The vocal range in the song ranges from the low note of D4 to the high note of F5. Lyrically, [...] "East to West" [...] deals {{with the concept of}} forgiveness, and the doubt that God forgives and forgets all sin. Casting Crowns' lead vocalist Mark Hall explained that: [...] "We have a hard time with the concept of forgiveness. <b>We</b> <b>cut</b> ourselves and it heals, but the scar remains. Sometimes we think God treats sin like we would if we were God, and that he handles forgiveness like we would. We know he forgives, but we can't accept that God chooses to forget and relinquishes his right to avenge. That's what we're singing about in 'East To West'". In a separate interview, Hall elaborated on that theme, commenting that: [...] "I see forgiveness as God giving away His right to revenge in my life. He loved me so much that He’s choosing to remember that against me no more, all because of Jesus".|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} {{synchronize}} the samples, The Bomb Squad used SMPTE timecodes and arranged and overdubbed particular bits of backing tracks, {{which had been}} inspected by the members for snare, bass, and hi-hat sounds. Chuck D said of their production and sampling, [...] "Our music is all about samples in the right area, layers that pile on each other. We put loops on top of loops on top of loops, but then in the mix <b>we</b> <b>cut</b> things away". Their production was innovative, according to journalist Jeff Chang. [...] "They're {{figuring out how to}} jam with the samples and to create these layers of sound", Chang said. [...] "I don't think it’s been matched since then." [...] After the tracks were completed, The Bomb Squad began sequencing what was at first a seemingly discontinuous album, amid internal disputes among its members. The final mixing took place at Greene St. Recording and lasted until February 1990. According to Sadler, [...] "a lot of people were like, 'Wow, it's a brilliant album'. But it really shoulda been much better. If we had more time and we didn't {{have to deal with the}} situation of nobody talking".|$|E
40|$|Given a {{definite}} logic program with <b>cut,</b> <b>we</b> proceed in two steps {{to give it}} a semantics. First, <b>we</b> delete <b>cut</b> from the program, and construct the basic action theory for the resulting cut-free program in the situation calculus according to (Lin and Reiter [3]). We then formalize the effects of cut by adding to the basic action theory a situation calculus sentence that characterizes the set of situations (derivations) that are not eliminated by <b>cut.</b> <b>We</b> show that our semantics is well-behaved when the logic program is properly stratified. We also show that according to this semantics, the usual implementation of the negation-as-failure operator using cut is provably correct...|$|R

500|$|Mackendrick {{assumed that}} Odets would need {{only two or}} three weeks to polish the script, but he took four months. The {{director}} recalled, [...] "We started shooting with no final script at all, while Clifford reconstructed the thing from stem to stern". The plot was largely intact, but in Mackendrick's biography he is quoted from Notes on Sweet Smell of Success: [...] "What Clifford did, in effect, was dismantle the structure of every single sequence in order to rebuild situations and relationships that were much more complex, had much greater tension and more dramatic energy". This process took time, and the start date for the production could not be delayed. Odets had to accompany the production to Manhattan and continued rewriting while they shot there. Returning to the city that had shunned him for going to Hollywood made Odets very neurotic and obsessed with all kinds of rituals as he worked at a furious pace, with pages often going straight from his typewriter to being shot the same day. Mackendrick said, [...] "So <b>we</b> <b>cut</b> the script there on the floor, with the actors, just cutting down lines, making them more spare – what Clifford would have done himself, really, had there been time".|$|E
500|$|Gems {{eventually}} {{returned to}} the project, writing a total of 12 drafts of the script. Although he is credited with both the screen story and screenplay of Mars Attacks!, Gems dedicates his novelization of the movie to Burton, who [...] "co-wrote the screenplay and didn't ask for a credit". Warner Bros. was dubious of the Martian dialogue and wanted Burton to add closed captioning subtitles, but he resisted. Working with Burton, Gems pared the film's 60 leading characters down to 23, and the worldwide destruction planned for the film was isolated to three major cities. Scenes featuring Martians attacking China, the Philippines, Japan, Europe, Africa, India, and Russia were deleted from the screenplay. [...] "Bear in mind this was way before Independence Day (1996) was written," [...] Gems commented. [...] "We had things like Manhattan being destroyed building by building, the White House went {{and so did the}} Empire State Building. Warner Bros. figured all this would be too expensive, so <b>we</b> <b>cut</b> most of that out to reduce the cost." [...] Howard Stern claimed that the film's climax, where an attack by Martians was thwarted by playing Slim Whitman songs to them, was originally created by him when he worked at WNBC in 1982, in a sketch named [...] "Slim Whitman vs. The Midget Aliens From Mars." [...] As Burton listened to the sketch while being interviewed by Stern, he dismissed it as mere coincidence.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Dan Povenmire, while Peter Shin contributed as supervising director. Various scenes in [...] "PTV" [...] were {{taken out of the}} episode due to Fox's international censors. As the writers worked on the episode the producers ended up, as the Chicago Tribune describes it, [...] "horse trading" [...] with Fox, removing a body-part reference in exchange for a dirty word. While the writing staff of the show was disappointed with the number of scenes that were removed from the episode, they were happy with the final result. The opening sequence, of which Family Guys creator Seth MacFarlane was particularly proud, was added into the episode after the producers discovered the episode ran three minutes short. The episode contained a montage which showcased the most bawdy moments of the previous seasons; Povenmire recalled the sequence; about it he stated that [...] "I just found those off the DVD and digitized them and edited them in. Basically because I didn't want to draw all those things! I found the most disgusting images from the first three seasons. And we actually got network notes on two of them saying, 'You're gonna have to cut that!' And I went, 'This has been on the air! And I'm only showing 8 frames of it!' And it turns out <b>we</b> <b>cut</b> them now when they're on the air. So apropos for the FCC episode." ...|$|E
