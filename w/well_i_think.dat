5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself I had come to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very <b>well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E
5|$|<b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{the subject}} of race has been so {{difficult}} and so polluted by malign ideas that most people have just left it alone, including geneticists. … Most genetic variation is neutral – it doesn't do anything for or against the phenotype, and evolution ignores it – so most previous attempts to look at race have concluded that there's little difference between races. I think this position is the one on which the social scientists are basing their position. … If {{you look at the}} genes that do make a difference, selected genes, which are a tiny handful of the whole, you do find a number of differences, not very many, but a number of interesting differences between races as to which genes have been selected. This, of course, makes a lot of sense, because once the human family dispersed from its homeland in Africa, people faced different environments on each continent, different climates, different evolutionary challenges, and each group adapted to its environment in its own way.|$|E
500|$|Yeah, we {{were kind}} of {{disappointed}} [...] because it sold really <b>well.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it was just the timing because One Direction at the same time shot straight to number one with 'Little Things'.

500|$|McCoy is {{a member}} of the Church of Christ and {{attended}} Westover Hills Church of Christ in Austin, Texas. When living in Buffalo Gap, he attended and was very involved with the Oldham Lane Church of Christ. McCoy has participated in a church youth group since 2002. His work has included landscaping yards for the elderly, visiting nursing homes, helping with meals on wheels, and ministry. Fellow quarterback Tim Tebow said of McCoy, [...] "I was really proud of him because I think he represents college football and his faith extremely well, too, which I really respect as <b>well.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he's done a good job with everything he's going through." [...] McCoy was selected to welcome President George W. Bush home to Texas after his second term ended on January 20, 2009.|$|E
500|$|... "The List" [...] premiered on the Fox {{network in}} the United States on October 20, 1995. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 10.8, with a 19 share, meaning that roughly 10.8 percent of all television-equipped {{households}}, and 19 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was watched {{by a total of}} 16.72 million viewers, and was later nominated for several International Monitor Awards, including nominations for best director, best editing, and best color correction. [...] "The List" [...] later won the award for best director. Story editor Frank Spotnitz said of the episode, [...] "I think this is a vastly underrated episode. I also think it was a very brave and different show to do and that it will weather the test of time very <b>well.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it was brave because {{there is not a single}} likable character - nobody you can root for. Mulder and Scully do not solve the case, and that is something I had been interested in doing for some time." [...] Chris Carter was nominated for an award by the Directors Guild of America for his work on this episode.|$|E

500|$|At that point, First Officer Klotz radioed the controller, saying, [...] "ah <b>well</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we need {{priority}} we're passing [...]" [...] The controller inquired as to {{how long}} the flight could hold {{as well as what}} their alternate airport was. Klotz replied at 20:46:03 that they could hold for five more minutes. The controller once again inquired as to their alternate airport and Klotz replied at 20:46:24, [...] "It was Boston but we can't do it now we, we, don't, we run out of fuel now." [...] A handoff controller listening in on the conversation called the New York Terminal Radar Approach Control (NY TRACON) at 20:46:24 and advised the TRACON controller that Avianca Flight 52 could only hold for five more minutes. The handoff controller asked whether NY TRACON could take the flight or whether to send Avianca to its alternate airport. The NY TRACON controller replied, [...] "Slow him to one eight zero knots and I'll take him." [...] The handoff controller later testified that he had not heard Flight 52 say that they could no longer reach their alternate airport. At 20:46:47, the NY ARTCC radar controller cleared the flight to proceed to JFK at [...] and to slow to [...] Flight 52 departed the CAMRN holding pattern at 20:47.|$|E
500|$|Cukor {{himself was}} highly {{dissatisfied}} by the film. [...] "I suspect {{the story was}} basically fraudulent," [...] he told an interviewer. Like many critics, he felt that [...] "as a piece of storytelling, the unfolding of a mystery, {{the first half of}} Keeper of the Flame is a damn good show", {{but the rest of the}} film had substantial problems. He praised Spencer Tracy's work, saying: [...] "Tracy... was at his best in the picture. Subdued, cool, he conveyed the ruthlessness of the reporter sent to investigate Forrest's death without seeming to try. He was ideally cast in the role, grimly and skeptically exploring the secret of the dead boys' club hero who was in fact a rampant fascist." [...] Hepburn, he felt, was hindered by the role and her approach to it. [...] "It was Kate's last romantic glamour-girl part, and she acted with some of that artificiality she'd supposedly left behind at RKO. That first scene, floating into a room in yards and yards of draperies with these lillies—well, it was all far, far too much. I don't think I really believed in the story, it was pure hokeypokey, and her part was phony, highfalutin." [...] He particularly disliked Hepburn's entrance in the film, with the long dress and lillies. But he felt Hepburn did her best: [...] "That's awfully tricky isn't it? And doesn't she give long, piercing looks at his portrait over the mantel? <b>Well.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> she finally carried a slightly phony part because her humanity asserted itself, and her humor. They always did." [...] Overall, though, Cukor felt the film was leaden, and that it had [...] "a wax work quality". Even screenwriter Stewart eventually came to feel the film was [...] "tedious, wooden, and heavy-handed".|$|E
500|$|In 2008, former {{baseball}} players' union chief Marvin Miller, {{trying to}} defend the recently retired catcher Mike Piazza against claims {{that he should not}} be elected to the Hall of Fame because of association with the use of steroids, on the basis that the Hall of Fame has various unsavory people in it, opined that Speaker should be removed from the Hall of Fame because of alleged membership in the Ku Klux Klan. Miller said, [...] "Some of the early people inducted in the Hall were members of the Ku Klux Klan: Tris Speaker, Cap Anson, and some people suspect Ty Cobb as <b>well.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that by and large, the players, and certainly the ones I knew, are good people. But the Hall is full of villains." [...] Miller's comment about Anson has no basis, other than speculating that he could have been a Klansman since he was a racist during his playing career, which ended in 1897, although he was umpiring games with black players by 1901, including featuring the all-black Columbia Giants. [...] Miller, age 91 at the time the 2008 article appeared, is the earliest source for declaring that it is factual that Anson {{was a member of the}} Klan, based purely on an Internet search of sources that try to link Anson to the Klan. [...] By contrast, Speaker-Cobb-Rogers Hornsby biographer Charles C. Alexander, a Klan expert in his general history writings, told fellow baseball author Marty Appel, apparently referring to the 1920s (Anson died in 1922), “As I’ve suggested in the biographies, it’s possible that they [...] were briefly in the Klan, which was very strong in Texas and especially in Fort Worth and Dallas. [...] The Klan went all out to recruit prominent people in all fields, provided they were native born, Protestant and white.” ...|$|E

"Marriage {{should be}} {{a man and a}} woman...I think that the {{domestic}} partnership legislation in NY has worked very, very <b>well.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's a good way to deal with it, and I {{think that would be a}} good model for other states to have. Some places call them domestic partnerships, some states call it civil unions, and I think that would be the best way to deal with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I think {{life has}} always been a {{pressure}} cooker. People react to whatever pressures they’re under at the time according to their tolerance level and their mental attitude.

2500|$|James S. Ketchum, {{a retired}} psychiatrist, {{veteran of the}} former U.S. {{chemical}} warfare program, and advocate of chemical warfare, believes that people who fear chemical agents more than bullets and bombs are irrational. He cited the Russian government actions approvingly: [...] "It’s been looked at by some skeptics {{as a kind of}} tragedy...They say, ‘Look, a hundred and thirty people died.’ <b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that a hundred and thirty is better than eight hundred, and it’s also better, as a secondary consideration, not to have to blow up a beautiful theatre." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an April 2003 article, Miller, ostensibly on {{the basis}} of {{statements}} from the military unit in which she was embedded, reported claims allegedly made by an Iraqi scientist that Iraq had kept biological and chemical weapons until [...] "right before the invasion." [...] This report was widely repeated in the press. Miller went on The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer and stated: <b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they found something more than a smoking gun. What they've found is a silver bullet {{in the form of a}} person, an Iraqi individual, a scientist, as we've called him, who really worked on the programs, who knows them firsthand, and who has led MET Alpha people to some pretty startling conclusions.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002 the {{character}} {{was featured in}} a spoof of the Michael Jackson hit video, Thriller, which was made {{as part of the}} annual fund-raising event, Children in Need. Shaun Williamson as Barry played the Michael Jackson role, while Lucy Speed as Natalie took on Ola Ray’s role as his date. Unlike the original video – where Jackson was seen to turn into a zombie – the spoof saw Natalie transformed into the walking dead. A dozen cast-members took part in the spoof where they recreated the dance routine made famous in the original video. [...] Speed has commented “I really enjoyed that. We were there on our day off but it was brilliant fun. I used to be a dancer {{and to be able to}} do some moves on the Square was good. We all wanted to look as horrific and disgusting as possible. Shaun split his trousers while doing it as <b>well.</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they were really tight though.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Gingrich {{has been}} very {{critical}} of Obama's handling {{of the crisis in}} Egypt, and has warned of the possibility that Egypt might [...] "go the way of Iran". Gingrich said, [...] "I think this is a period of tremendous challenge and is a sign of the general failure of our strategy of not dealing with radical Islamists and not being honest and aggressive of what's going on around the world." [...] Gingrich also said that the Obama administration had failed to take the Middle East seriously and that Obama's 2009 speech in Cairo designed to improve relations with the Muslim world was a mistake. Gingrich said, [...] "The president went to Cairo and gave his famous speech in which he explained that we should all be friends together because we're all the same people doing the same things and there are no differences between us. <b>Well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{there are a lot of}} differences between the Muslim Brotherhood and the rest of us." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to The Washington Post, [...] "some UN {{employees}} and delegates" [...] expressed resentment at Ban's perceived favoritism in {{the appointment of}} South Korean nationals in key posts. Previous UN chiefs such as Kurt Waldheim (Austria), Javier Pérez de Cuéllar (Peru), and Boutros Boutros-Ghali (Egypt) brought small teams of trusted aides or clerical workers from their country's Foreign Ministry, and South Korean nationals have been historically underrepresented at the United Nations. Nonetheless, according to [...] "some officials" [...] in the Post story, Ban had allegedly gone further, boosting South Korea's presence in UN ranks by more than 20 percent during {{his first year in}} office. In response, Ban and his aides stated that the allegations of favoritism are wrong, and that some of the harshest criticisms against him have undercurrents of racism. He said that the South Korean nationals he had appointed—including Choi Young-jin, who had already served as a high-ranking official in the United Nations' peacekeeping department—are highly qualified for their positions. Others such as Donald P. Gregg, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea, said that the complaints were driven by envy: [...] "I think being from South Korea, and people have growing respect for South Korea, that's a great enhancement for the secretary general. If he brings along talented people who he knows very <b>well,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that's also a plus." [...] UN records show that South Korea, the organization's eleventh-largest financial contributor, had only 54 South Korean nationals assigned to its mission six months before Ban took over the top UN post. By contrast, the Philippines, a significantly poorer country, had 759 nationals in its mission.|$|E
