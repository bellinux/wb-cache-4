These raise concern about firms' ability to develop, implement and effectively supervise their automated systems. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has stated that it will assess whether firms' testing and controls related to algorithmic trading and other automated trading strategies and trading systems are adequate in light of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and firms' supervisory obligations. This assessment may take the form of examinations and targeted investigations. Firms will be required to address whether they conduct separate, independent and robust pre-implementation testing of algorithms and trading systems and whether the firm's legal, compliance and operations staff are reviewing the design and development of the algorithms and trading systems for compliance with legal requirements. FINRA will review whether a firm actively monitors and reviews algorithms and trading systems once they are placed into production systems and after they have been modified, including procedures and controls used to detect potential trading abuses such as <b>wash</b> sales, <b>marking,</b> layering and momentum ignition strategies. Finally, firms will need to describe their approach to firm-wide disconnect or “kill” switches, as well as procedures for responding to catastrophic system malfunctions.|$|R

The parishes along the coast of the Wash had no eastern boundaries, and were continually expanding as new land was reclaimed from the tidal marshes. The marshes produced methane gas which spontaneously ignited to produce flares, giving rise to the belief that they were haunted by spirits and that the new land needed cleansing before it was safe to use. This may account for the veneration of St Guthlac at Fishtoft, the saint being renowned for driving out devils; a medieval statue of St Guthlac can be seen high up on the tower of the Fishtoft parish church, and formerly held the whip with which he cleansed the land of evil spirits.|$|R
40|$|International audienceLatent fingermarks {{developed}} by cyanoacrylate fuming often lack contrast; therefore further enhancement is required, such as dye staining. This second step {{is part of}} the conventional detection sequences performed by forensics practitioners. Dye-staining or powder dusting aims at improving contrast and at increasing the legibility of details, yet their use may at times be limited. Indeed powder dusting may not be effective due to unexpected adherence to the background, and poor affinity to the cyanoacrylate. In the same way staining processes can dye a whole semi-porous surface or may <b>wash</b> the <b>marks.</b> To avoid that second step, a new luminescent cyanoacrylate (LumicyanoTM) which allows one-step development without changing the fuming chamber settings (80 % humidity rate, 120 8 C fuming temperature) was developed and assessed. This study aimed at comparing LumicyanoTM to a conventional two-step process. A detailed sensitivity study was conducted on glass slides, as well as the processing of various non-porous and semi-porous substrates, usually considered as problematic for a dye staining step. The results indicate that LumicyanoTM detects fingermarks with equal or better sensitivity and ridge details than currently used cyanoacrylate. Secondly in luminescent mode, good ridges clarity and excellent contrast are observed, even if LumicyanoTM is sometimes less bright than the two-step process. Furthermore, conventional enhancement can still be carried out if needed. As a conclusion, LumicyanoTM makes it possible to avoid an enhancement step which can be detrimental to further examinations, particularly on rough or semi-porous surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Oxidative {{modification}} of low density lipoprotein (LDL) renders it more atherogenic. Probucol, a highly nonpolar antioxidant, is transported in lipoproteins, including LDL, and inhibits oxidative {{modification of}} LDL in vitro. The ability of probucol to inhibit atherogenesis in the LDL receptor-deficient rabbit has {{been attributed to}} its antioxidant effect. We report synthesis of a new water-soluble analogue of probucol that is very effective in preventing cell-induced LDL oxidation. The polar probucol derivative, diglutaryl probucol, is efficiently taken up by endothelial cells and macrophages in culture and is hydrolyzed to release the active antioxidant, probucol. The treated cells, after thorough <b>washing,</b> show a <b>marked</b> decrease in their capacity to oxidize LDL during a subsequent incubation. At high concentrations of the derivative, the cells also released free probucol into the medium. Thus, the effectiveness of probucol in vivo may be related both to its presence in LDL, acting as a nonspecific antioxidant, and to an additional ability to inhibit cell-mediated oxidation of LDL by virtue of its uptake into cells...|$|R

40|$|The dog {{pancreas}} {{isolated in}} situ was perfused with oxygenated dog blood and stimulated with pancreozymin, sccretin, or both. There {{were no significant}} changes in the fine structure of the acinar, centroacinar, or duct cells attributable to the perfusion. Combined glutaraldehyde and osmium fixation gave good preservation of the secretory products of the acinar cell. Before stimulation, the lumen of the acini is filled with material similar in texture to the content of the zymogen granules, but of somewhat lower density. Release of secretion commonly takes place by coalescence of the limiting membrane of zymogen granules with the plasmalemma, but one granule opening at the surface may frequently be joined by others coalescing with its membrane and forming an interconnected series all with contents having the same texture as the released zymogen. Such a mechanism seems to permit a more rapid release of secretory product than discharge of individual granules. Pancreozymin stimulation caused marked depletion of zymogen granules, but no obvious changes in the Golgi apparatus. It is clear, therefore, that this hormone exerts its effect upon release of granules rather than upon their formation. Sccretin stimulation of water and bicarbonate secretion caused a <b>marked</b> <b>washing</b> out of the luminal contents, but had little detectable effect on cellular structure...|$|R

This major mountain-building event started {{near the end of}} the Mesozoic, around 75 million years ago, and continued into the Eocene period of the Cenozoic. It was caused by subduction off the western coast of North America. Major faults that trend north-south and cross the canyon area were reactivated by this uplift.

Streams draining the Rocky Mountains in early Miocene time terminated in landlocked basins in Utah, Arizona and Nevada but there is no evidence for a major river.Around 18 million years ago, tensional forces started to thin and drop the region to the west, creating the Basin and Range Province.

40|$|We have {{simulated}} {{the formation}} of a massive galaxy cluster (M_ 200 ^ crit = 1. 1 × 10 ^ 15 h^- 1 M_) in a ΛCDM universe using 10 different codes (RAMSES, 2 incarnations of AREPO and 7 of GADGET), modeling hydrodynamics with full radiative subgrid physics. These codes include Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), spanning traditional and advanced SPH schemes, adaptive mesh and moving mesh codes. Our goal is to study the consistency between simulated clusters modeled with different radiative physical implementations - such as cooling, star formation and AGN feedback. We compare images of the cluster at z= 0, global properties such as mass, and radial profiles of various dynamical and thermodynamical quantities. We find that, with respect to non-radiative simulations, dark matter is more centrally concentrated, the extent not simply depending on the presence/absence of AGN feedback. The scatter in global quantities is substantially higher than for non-radiative runs. Intriguingly, adding radiative physics seems to have <b>washed</b> away the <b>marked</b> code-based differences present in the entropy profile seen for non-radiative simulations in Sembolini et al. (2015) : radiative physics + classic SPH can produce entropy cores. Furthermore, the inclusion/absence of AGN feedback is not the dividing line -as in the case of describing the stellar content- for whether a code produces an unrealistic temperature inversion and a falling central entropy profile. However, AGN feedback does strongly affect the overall stellar distribution, limiting the effect of overcooling and reducing sensibly the stellar fraction.

The narcotic antagonists naloxone and diprenorphine failed to increase cGMP content; moreover, in the presence of 5 μM naloxone, the EC 50 of ETP increased from ≈ 9 nM to > 1 μM. N 4 TG 1 cells that had been incubated for 20 min with 0. 32 μM ETP and thoroughly <b>washed</b> displayed a <b>marked</b> loss in sensitivity to subsequent ETP challenge. This desensitization was characterized by a 40 - 50 % decrease in maximal response and an increase in the apparent Ka of ETP from 4 to 50 nM. Desensitization was complete after a 7 -min incubation with 0. 32 μM ETP (t½ ≈ 1 min) and was only slowly reversible (t½ > 60 min). Naloxone (5 μM) and diprenorphine (0. 1 μM) failed to elicit desensitization, but they blocked ETP-induced desensitization. Dextrophan and (+) -ethylketazocine were < 1 % as effective as levorphanol and (-) -ethylketazocine, respectively, in both stimulating cGMP accumulation and inducing desensitization. When the binding of [3 H]ETP (0. 2 - 20 nM) was examined under identical experimental conditions, cells that were completely desensitized by incubation with ETP (7 min with 0. 32 μM or 20 min with 15 nM) showed no loss of high-affinity recognition sites. After longer incubation with ETP (0. 32 μM for 20 - 60 min), the maximal binding of [3 H]ETP was reduced 17 - 41 %. The specific short-term desensitization of cGMP accumulation is not mediated or accompanied by a decrement in the number of agonist binding sites...|$|R
50|$|It is {{believed}} {{the artist was}} born in Antwerp in 1551. It is not clear with whom he trained. He received commissions from the leading Antwerp publisher Hieronymus Cock. He made engravings after the paintings of famous Flemish painters of the previous generation as well as contemporary artists such as Hieronymus Bosch, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Frans Floris and Lambert Lombard. He also worked after the original designs made by contemporary artists such as Pieter Bruegel and Hans Bol for the publishing projects of Hieronymus Cock. An example is the project of four prints representing the four seasons, originally started by Bruegel as a project for Hieronymus Cock. Bruegel had revived the medieval tradition of depicting the four seasons with his monumental series of the months painted in 1565. When Bruegel died in 1569, he had only completed the designs for Spring and Summer. Hieronymus Cock then commissioned Bol to make designs for Autumn and Winter. The set of four prints were engraved by Pieter van der Heyden and published by Cock in 1570.Pieter van der Heyden was from 1556 onwards {{one of the primary}} engravers of the work of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Although van der Heyden was not an inventive engraver and his figures are considered to be stiff and angular, Bruegel seems to have preferred working with the artist because of his highly skilled technique and his fidelity to the design he was copying. It is possible that because of his awareness of these limitations of van der Heyden, Bruegel started to adapt his designs so that they did not require skill in translating <b>washing</b> and free-flowing <b>marks</b> but could be followed line for line. Van der Heyden made 26 engravings after designs by Bruegel, the most of any other printmaker.|$|R
