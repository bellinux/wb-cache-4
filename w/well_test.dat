40|$|For decades, <b>well</b> <b>tests</b> {{have been}} widely used in the oil {{industry}} for evaluation of well productivity and reservoir properties, which provide key information for field development and facilities design. In conventional <b>well</b> <b>tests</b> equilibrium conditions are required in the reservoir before the test. Furthermore, a single well only can be produced at a time, inducing one or more pressure draw-down periods followed by a final pressure build-up which are the object of the interpretation. Harmonic testing has been developed as a form of <b>well</b> <b>testing</b> that can be applied during ongoing production or injection operations, as a pulsed signal is superimposed on the background pressure trend. Thus no interruption of well and reservoir production is needed before and during the test. If the pulsed pressure and rate signal analysis is performed in the frequency domain, a strong similarity exists between the derivative of the harmonic response function versus the harmonic period and the pressure derivative versus time, typical of conventional <b>well</b> <b>testing.</b> Thus the interpretation of harmonic <b>well</b> <b>tests</b> becomes very straightforward.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Extended <b>well</b> <b>testing</b> has emerged from the need for accurate, reliable predictions of well performance. Recent events in the Gulf of Mexico have demonstrated this need.

The proposed extended <b>well</b> <b>testing</b> system consists of a moored tanker and a semi-submersible joined by a hawser.
