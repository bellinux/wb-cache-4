500|$|In various episodes, Santa's Little Helper {{can be seen}} {{chewing on}} {{newspapers}} and other objects in the Simpsons' household, destroying furniture, and digging holes in the backyard. In [...] "Bart's Dog Gets an F" [...] (season two, 1991), he manages to infuriate the entire family by destroying valued items in the home. As a result, Homer and Marge <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> the dog, but Bart and Lisa convince them {{that he can be}} trained at an obedience school. Santa's Little Helper does not do well there as Bart is unwilling to use a choke chain suggested by the instructor. The night before the final exam, Bart and Santa's Little Helper play, thinking it will be their last few hours together. This bonding breaks down the communication barrier, allowing the dog to understand Bart's commands, and consequently pass the obedience school.|$|E
500|$|Bans called Waller {{getting a}} new penis the most {{emotional}} scene she had to write, adding: [...] "I loved this story because I hate the idea that once you're old, your life is over. I hate when people treat their aging parents like old furniture they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> but {{have to find a}} place for so they stick 'em in the corner and forget about them." [...] Bans also commented on Heigl's character's storyline, writing: [...] "Poor Izzie. The girl's living with cancer, lost her best friend, impulsively got married and dragged her husband away to live in the woods. That takes a lot out of a person. I need to seriously recover on the couch for an hour after I {{go to the grocery store}} – I can't imagine the emotional and physical fatigue Izzie must be feeling right now. I think by the end of this episode, after Owen tells her that channeling her experience as a patient at Seattle Grace is undermining her strength as a doctor at Seattle Grace – she's wondering if she made a mistake. She's wondering if Alex and Derek and now Owen might be right – that she came back to work too soon. That she's not emotionally ready to be cutting into people yet. Because I think every doctor wants to believe all their terminal patients can be Izzie – but the odds tell another story." ...|$|E
2500|$|He further criticises the [...] "Western hypocrisy" [...] {{and hopes}} [...] "that many will <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> their silence, to demand from the {{initiator}} of this recognizable danger , to abstinence from violence".|$|E

2500|$|... "If {{he finds}} the crowd harsh here then he must {{remember}} he asked for it." [...] said Jeremy Coney. [...] "But crowds just can't be neutral about him", he said. Some applaud his behaviour and others didn't. His behaviour polarises the crowds here and he must expect some sort of reaction from those who don't like it. I just feel neutral about him – when he is batting I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> him, when he is bowling I want to hit him around the park." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 13, 1938, Kennedy {{met with}} Herbert von Dirksen, the German {{ambassador}} to the United Kingdom, in London, who claimed upon his return to Berlin that Kennedy {{had told him that}} [...] "it was not so much the fact that we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> the Jews that was so harmful to us, but rather the loud clamor with which we accompanied this purpose. [...] himself fully understood our Jewish policy." [...] Kennedy's main concern with such violent acts against German Jews as Kristallnacht was that they generated bad publicity in the West for the Nazi regime, a concern that he communicated in a letter to Charles Lindbergh.|$|E
2500|$|The {{structure}} of the poem forms an interesting and logical argument and progression. [...] In the first stanza he is saying you're too good for me, so I understand if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> me. [...] In the second stanza he is saying that I am nowhere close to good enough for you, but maybe you {{are not aware of}} it. [...] And in the third stanza he is saying you are too good for me, but maybe you didn't realize that before. [...] In the closing couplet, Shakespeare confesses that no matter what the cause of misjudgment, you're released by the mistake, and [...] "I'm left here to remember our time together" [...] when I felt like nobility.|$|E

2500|$|Hofstadter, {{influenced}} by his wife, {{was a member}} of the Young Communist League in college, and in April 1938 he joined the Communist Party of the USA; he quit in 1939. [...] Hofstadter had been reluctant to join, knowing the orthodoxy it imposed on intellectuals, and disillusioned by the spectacle of the Moscow Show Trials, but wrote: [...] "I join without enthusiasm but with a sense of obligation...my fundamental reason for joining is that I don't like capitalism and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> it." [...] He remained anti-capitalist, writing: [...] "I hate capitalism and everything that goes with it", but was similarly disillusioned with Stalinism, finding the Soviet Union [...] "essentially undemocratic" [...] and the Communist Party rigid and doctrinaire. In the 1940s Hofstadter abandoned political causes, feeling that intellectuals were no more likely to [...] "find a comfortable home" [...] under socialism than they were under capitalism.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2000, Evans met teenage {{pop star}} Billie Piper, whom he dated for a while. As a present to him, she {{proposed}} on his 35th birthday, {{and the couple}} married in a £200 ceremony at The Little Church of the West in Las Vegas, Nevada on 6 May 2001, in a ceremony attended by six guests including best man Danny Baker. In September 2004, news stories circulated regarding a trial separation – Evans at the time had a stall at Camden Market, where he was found selling furniture and paintings from his London and Los Angeles homes, commenting: [...] "I just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> it all, it's just a headache." [...] In 2005, {{it was confirmed that}} Evans and Piper would divorce, with Piper publicly stating that she would take no money from Evans. Almost three years after they had separated, Evans and Piper divorced in May 2007, but have remained on good terms.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{signed the}} {{pre-contract}} with Real Madrid, McManaman still had five months {{left on his}} contract at Liverpool. New manager Gérard Houllier, who had replaced Evans as full coach following the failure of their joint-managerial role, was widely believed to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> the [...] "Spice Boys" [...] mentality and cavalier attitudes at the club having told many players they were surplus to requirements (including Jason McAteer, Phil Babb, Rob Jones, Stig Bjornebye and Paul Ince). While stating {{that he would have}} preferred that the player stayed, he said that the club had to respect McManaman's decision to exercise his right to leave {{at the end of his}} contract. Houllier said, [...] "It wasn't unexpected. Steve had always maintained that he wanted to move abroad and I have to respect that... Emotionally we will miss him because he's a Liverpool lad, and needless to say as a player you can't fault him because he has immense ability... I will have to replace him, it's my job to go out and find another Steve McManaman." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shortly thereafter, Miller {{appeared}} {{in an interview}} with Chris Matthews on the MSNBC show Hardball. Here, Miller became visibly angry. Matthews criticized the premise of Miller's assertion that Kerry had actually voted against such defense programs by noting that in voting on appropriations bills, senators often vote against a version of a bill without wishing to oppose every item in that bill. Matthews also asked Miller to compare his assertion that a military under Kerry would be armed with only [...] "spitballs" [...] with rhetoric from Democrats that Republicans [...] "want to starve little kids, they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>rid</b> <b>of</b> education, they want to kill the old people" [...] and whether such level of rhetoric was constructive. When Miller expressed irritation at this line of questioning, Matthews pressed Miller with the question, [...] "Do you believe now– do you believe, Senator, truthfully, that John Kerry wants to defend the country with spitballs?" [...] Miller at first said that he wished the interview had been face-to-face so that he could [...] "get a little closer up into your face." [...] Miller angrily told Matthews to [...] "get out of my face," [...] and declared, [...] "I wish we lived in the day where you could challenge a person to a duel." [...] At the conclusion of the interview, Matthews asked [...] "Let's be friends," [...] which Miller ignored. Miller later said about the interview, [...] "That was terrible. I embarrassed myself. I’d rather it had not happened." ...|$|E
