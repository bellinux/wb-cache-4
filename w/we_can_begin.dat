25|$|Phylogeny {{can give}} {{some sense of}} history when {{combined}} {{with a little bit}} more information. Each difference in the DNA indicates divergence between one species and another. This divergence, whether via drift or natural selection, is representative of some lapse of time. Comparing DNA sequences alone gives a record of the history of evolution with an arbitrary measure of phylogenetic distance “dating” that last common ancestor. However, if information about the rate of genetic mutation is available or geologic markers are present to calibrate evolutionary divergence (i.e. fossils), we have a timeline of evolution. From there, with an idea about other contemporaneous changes in life and environment, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>begin</b> to speculate why certain evolutionary paths might have been selected for.|$|E

McGrath of the {{religious}} website Patheos found that [...] "A Town Called Mercy" [...] had strong religious themes and moral messages, writing that it [...] "really is about mercy, about forgiveness, about war crimes, about vengeance, and about justice".

McGrath also noted a [...] "take-home religious message" [...] in the scene near the end where the town gathers in the church while the Gunslinger and the Doctor face off; he felt that it emphasised the importance of valuing human life.|$|E

500|$|The album's {{opening track}} and third single, [...] "Drowned World/Substitute For Love" [...] is a downtempo ballad drawing {{influences}} from jungle, drum and bass and trip hop music. The title {{is inspired by}} J.G. Ballard's post-apocalyptic science fiction novel The Drowned World (1962). [...] "Swim", the second song, has a spiritual tone. She sings: [...] "Swim to the ocean floor/So that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>begin</b> again/Wash away all our sins/Crash to the other shore". [...] "Ray of Light", the third track and album's second single, is an up-tempo electronic dance-pop song which contains strong techno tendencies and influences of trance music. A [...] "sonically progressive" [...] track, it also incorporates elements of rock music, with a prominent electric guitar riff. The melody also has several sound effects, including whistles and bleeps. [...] "Candy Perfume Girl" [...] has a grunge intro and continues to pair post-modern beeps and beats with old-fashioned electric guitar flare ups. In the next song, [...] "Skin", Madonna sings [...] "Do I know you from somewhere?" [...] in a yearning voice over the beats of an electronic orchestra.

2500|$|With the Renaissance {{came the}} Protestant Reformation, which {{in many ways}} downplayed mysticism, {{although}} it still produced {{a fair amount of}} spiritual literature. Even the most active reformers can be linked to Medieval mystical traditions. Martin Luther, for instance, was a monk who was influenced by the German Dominican mystical tradition of Eckhart and Tauler as well by the Dionysian-influenced Wesenmystik ("essence mysticism") tradition. He also published the Theologia Germanica, which he claimed was the most important book after the Bible and Augustine for teaching him about God, Christ, and humanity. Even John Calvin, who rejected many Medieval ascetic practices and who favored doctrinal knowledge of God over affective experience, has Medieval influences, namely, Jean Gerson and the Devotio moderna, with its emphasis on piety as the method of spiritual growth in which the individual practices dependence on God by imitating Christ and the son-father relationship. Meanwhile, his notion that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>begin</b> to enjoy our eternal salvation through our earthly successes leads in later generations to [...] "a mysticism of consolation".|$|E

2500|$|... "In most conflicts, {{each party}} is certain {{he is right}} and the other wrong. And in the reality he lives in, this is {{genuinely}} the case. But in order to solve a conflict like ours, {{it is necessary to}} step into the reality of the 'other' – to see the world and events from his subjective perspective so that we can reconcile his reality with our own and merge these opposing versions of events into a bigger holistic truth inclusive enough to encompass both ostensibly rival truths. These subjective perceptions of reality constitute unique 'movies' in which we are each the protagonist. And any genuine approach to Israeli–Palestinian peace requires us to recognize the completely separate broader movies our two peoples each collectively live in. Both have experienced the past hundred years very differently and the major obstacle to attaining peace has almost nothing to do with territory but rather the inability on both sides to acknowledge, understand or accept the narrative of the 'other' without defensively feeling our own narratives threatened. I define the term 'narrative' here as a version of reality – a story told about a chain of events that organizes facts while being influenced by ideology. The same chain of events can be organized into many narratives, especially if influenced by different ideologies. The separate movies we live in very much impact how we relate to history, to ourselves and to each other in this country. Both sides tend to approach the conflict as a zero-sum game where there can only be one winner. And the conflict continues to rage partially because many of us are so trapped within our narrow paradigms that we refuse to acknowledge how things may look from different perspectives. Advocates on both sides often cite hard facts to support their positions. And while these facts might be true, they are not the only facts. And how we select, connect, contextualize and understand them is very much determined by the movies we live in. ... There is so much blame and pain powering this conflict. And acknowledging the narrative of the 'other' often feels like betraying our own. But if we can learn to see the greater movie comprising both our smaller movies and define the core aspirations and grievances of each side, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>begin</b> to chart a course that allows both peoples to be protagonists in a single story that successfully transcends the dualistic 'Arab versus Jew' paradigm and enables us all to experience the fulfillment of our deepest yearnings." ...|$|E
