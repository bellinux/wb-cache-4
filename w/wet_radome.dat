40|$|The use of {{millimeter}} wavelength radars for probing precipitation {{has recently}} gained interest. However, estimation of precipitation variables is not straightforward due to strong signal attenuation, radar receiver saturation, antenna <b>wet</b> <b>radome</b> effects and natural microphysical variability. Here, an automated algorithm is developed for routinely retrieving rain rates from the profiling Ka-band (35 -GHz) ARM (Atmospheric Radiation Measurement) zenith radars (KAZR). A 1 -dimensional, simple, steady state microphysical model {{is used to}} estimate impacts of microphysical processes and attenuation on the profiles of radar observables at 35 -GHz and thus provide criteria for identifying situations when attenuation or microphysical processes dominate KAZR observations. KAZR observations are also screened for signal saturation and <b>wet</b> <b>radome</b> effects. The algorithm is implemented in two steps: high rain rates are retrieved by using the amount of attenuation in rain layers, while low rain rates are retrieved from the reflectivity–rain rate (Z e – R) relation. Observations collected by the KAZR, rain gauge, disdrometer and scanning precipitating radars during the DYNAMO/AMIE field campaign at the Gan Island of the tropical Indian Ocean are used to validate the proposed approach. The differences in the rain accumulation from the proposed algorithm are quantified. The {{results indicate that the}} proposed algorithm has a potential for deriving continuous rain rate statistics in the tropics...|$|E
40|$|A {{search of}} {{scientific}} literature, both printed and electronic, was undertaken to provide quantitative estimates of attenuation effects of rainfall on weather radar radomes. The {{emphasis was on}} C-band (5 cm) and S-Band (10 cm) wavelengths. An empirical model was developed to estimate two-way <b>wet</b> <b>radome</b> losses {{as a function of}} frequency and rainfall rate for both standard and hydrophobic radomes. The model fits most of the published data within +/- 1 dB at both target wavelengths for rain rates from less than ten to more than 200 mm/hr. Rainfall attenuation effects remain under 1 dB at both frequencies regardless of radome type for rainfall rates up to 10 mm/hr. S-Band losses with a hydrophobic radome such as that on the WSR- 88 D remain under 1 dB up to 100 mm/hr. C-Band losses on standard radomes such as that on the Patrick AFB (Air Force Base) WSR- 74 C can reach as much as 5 dB at 50 mm/hr. In addition, calculations were performed to determine the reduction in effective reflectivity, Z, when a radar target is smaller than the sampling volume of the radar. Results are presented for both the Patrick Air Force Base WSR- 74 C and the WSR- 88 D as a function of target size and range...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} 195 rainfall events gathered with the X-band weather radar SOLIDAR and a {{tipping bucket rain gauge}} network near Delft, The Netherlands, between May 1993 and April 1994. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a thorough analysis of a climatological dataset using a high spatial (120 m) and temporal (16 s) resolution X-band radar. This makes it a study of the potential for high-resolution rainfall measurements with non-polarimetric X-band radar over flat terrain. An appropriate radar reflectivity – rain rate relation is derived from measurements of raindrop size distributions and compared with radar – rain gauge data. The radar calibration is assessed using a long-term comparison of rain gauge measurements with corresponding radar reflectivities as well as by analyzing the evolution of the stability of ground clutter areas over time. Three different methods for ground clutter correction as well as the effectiveness of forward and backward attenuation correction algorithms have been studied. Five individual rainfall events are discussed in detail to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of high-resolution X-band radar and the effectiveness of the presented correction methods. X-band radar is found to be able to measure the space-time variation of rainfall at high resolution, far greater than what can be achieved by rain gauge networks or a typical operational C-band weather radar. On the other hand, SOLIDAR can suffer from receiver saturation, <b>wet</b> <b>radome</b> attenuation as well as signal loss along the path. During very strong convective situations the signal can even be lost completely. In combination with several rain gauges for quality control, high resolution X-band radar is considered to be suitable for rainfall monitoring over relatively small (urban) catchments. These results offer great prospects for the new high resolution polarimetric doppler X-band radar IDR...|$|E

40|$|While their {{coverage}} is adequate for many applications, {{due to the}} Earth 2 ̆ 7 s curvature and terrain induced blockage, today 2 ̆ 7 s operational long-range weather surveillance radar networks lack the capability to provide low altitude observations below 2 km. The use of short-range distributed radar networks can overcome that limitation by providing the expected coverage {{close to the ground}} where most of the events that affect citizens 2 ̆ 7 lives occur. To pursue this vision, the Engineering Research Center (ERC) for Collaborative and Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA) has deployed two X-band radar network technology test beds in Oklahoma (IP 1) and western Puerto Rico (IP 3). The Oklahoma test bed investigates the ability of a distributive, adaptive and collaborative sensing (DCAS) network to observe, understand, predict and respond to the weather hazards (e. g. tornadoes, convective cells and super cell detection), while the Puerto Rico test bed investigates the deployment of a low cost (3 ̆c 30 K) and minimal infrastructure short range radar network which operates independently of wired power and communication infrastructure and is referred to as Off-the-Grid (OTG) for qualitative rainfall estimation and mapping. ^ As a result of errors from different sources, radar measurement and its resulting products (e. g. QPE) have an uncertainty associated with them. Before performing any QPE within the CASA radar networks, the sources of errors that affect the radar measurements need to be identified and evaluated in order to obtain the most accurate rainfall estimation from radar measurements. ^ This document investigates rainfall estimation using dense networks of short-range X-band radars. We consider QPE and the dual-polarized radar situation, such as the IP 1 network, and also consider 2 ̆ 2 qualitative Precipitation Estimation (qPE) 2 ̆ 2, using the simpler, single-parameter (single-polarized) radars such as the CASA OTG network. Error sources that affect the radar measurements (e. g. signal attenuation in rain, <b>wet</b> <b>radome</b> attenuation, clutter filtering effects, and antenna pointing errors), methods to calibrate or correct for bias in the radars 2 ̆ 7 power measurements and their respective verification, and radar-based rainfall estimation and network configuration improvements are investigated using both CASA test beds. Moreover, several important questions need to be addressed related to the design of OTG radar networks, including how to approach the problem of rainfall attenuation at the X-band operating frequency of the system and ground clutter correction without the polarimetric and Doppler velocity measurements capability. ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is the {{development}} of the highest quality quantitative precipitation estimate (QPE) for the Helsinki urban area through the creation of a quality controlled multi-radar composite. Weather radars suffer from a number of errors, and these are typically compounded when located near urban areas. Through the use of radar calibration, and several quality control methods, the three Helsinki area's radars (Kerava, Kumpula, Vantaa) were composited and a blended QPE was created. The three C-band dual-polarimetric weather radars were calibrated through the self-consistency theory which relates Z, Zdr, to Kdp. The calibration was conducted over several summer days in 2014 for each radar, and all were found to be under-calibrated by about 2 dB. The influence of rain on top of the radome was also examined and found that <b>wet</b> <b>radome</b> attenuation can produce several dB offset in calibration. Composites of Z and Kdp used weights were created to correct for non-hydrometeor class, beam blockage, attenuation of the beam, radome attenuation, range, and ground clutter. Noise in Kdp from light rain is reduced through utilizing the self-consistency theory. Composited reflectivity created significant improvements by filling data gaps, reducing errors, as well as providing additional observations for each echo. However minor errors, such as multi-trip echoes and speckle proceeded to the composite. The blended QPE was created from the composite data to obtain the benefits of R(Kdp) in heavy rain and hail, while R(Z) was used in cases of light rain. Rain rate algorithms developed for the Helsinki climate were implemented to calculate the rain intensity for the selected precipitation type, which were determined through a series of threshold values obtained from literature. R(Kdp) allows better estimation in for heavy rain and hail because of being closer related to the hydrometers diameter as well as being immune to a number of errors present in Z. The QPE created in this project provides improved precipitation intensity due to the use of multiple corrected radars. This data can be used for improved urban run-off modeling, emergency warnings and weather forecasting. However the method presented here is only applicable for liquid/mixed liquid and hail precipitation because of the impact of frozen hydrometeor on the dual-polarimetric parameters. Additional quality control methods and different precipitation estimates would be required for winter time precipitation. Vain tiivistelmä.

40|$|The {{availability}} of weather radar precipitation estimations is increasing {{the knowledge of}} rainfall systems on spatial and temporal scales that cannot be reached by rain gauge networks; consequently the approach to hydrological and geomorphological modeling is changing from concentrated catchment scale modeling - the only available for operational purposes when rainfal is estimated with rain gauges - to spatially distributed modeling. The use of weather radar in hydrology responds {{to the need for}} a description of rainfall spatial distribution integrated over the desired time scale and available on operational areas, a problem that will never be solved using only rain gauges. Nevertheless we have to mention that weather radar based measurements suffer from several sources of uncertainty. Microphysical assumptions are needed to convert reflected power measurements into rain rate and a number of errors, depending both on the instrument and on the rainfall system, decrease raw measurements quality. Despite the scientific and technological development of the last decades, radar quantitative precipitation estimation is still a scientific challenge and new elaboration procedures are needed for operational purposes (Panziera et al., 2011). The objective of the present research is to improve radar quantitative precipitation estimations for intense rainfall events in alpine regions and, in this way, fill the uncertainties concerning hydro-geological and debris-flows risk evaluation and forecasting that depend on the reliability of radar measurements (Berne e Krajewski, 2012; Chen et al., 2013). Heavy hydrometeorological events are often the most interesting for radar hydrometeorology because i) they are difficult to capture with other instruments (Borga et al., 2000, 2008). The work is organized into three themes: i) development of a re-analysis procedure for intense events, ii) characterization of the rainfall fields and analysis of rain gauge sampling for the same events and iii) improvement of the real-time elaboration routine. The study area is Trentino-Alto Adige that it is characterized by alpine topography and climatology where intense summer storms often lead to flash floods and debris flows. The elaboration procedure is focused on intense events re-analyses. The correction chain takes into account the effects of multiple uncertainties and uses physical-based algorithms for the correction of the effects due to i) <b>wet</b> <b>radome</b> attenuation (Marra et al., 2010), ii) beam blockage (Delrieu e Creutin, 1995), iii) attenuation (Delrieu et al., 1997, 1999 a,b, 2000; Serrar et al., 2000) and iv) vertical profile of reflectivity (Andrieu e Creutin, 1995 a,b). We re-analyzed 7 storm events and we quantified the quality of rainfall estimations by means of statistical indicators. We quantified the effect of the procedure and the contribution of every correction algorithm to the overall performance. Attenuation contributes with more than 50...|$|E
40|$|Chapter 1. This thesis {{presents}} {{studies on}} the variability of precipitation in the Netherlands from datasets collected by radars, rain gauges and disdrometers. Accurate rainfall estimates are highly relevant in hydrology, meteorology and climatology as precipitation has a large impact on society. Precipitation has been studied extensively in the past, although {{it is impossible to}} describe all processes and behavior involved. This thesis attempts to add to the knowledge on precipitation. In the first chapter a short overview of rainfall variability at different scales is presented together with the most common instruments for measuring precipitation. Chapter 2. The spatial variability of daily rainfall accumulations is studied. Ninety-day averaged semi-variograms are created based on a 30 -year data set gathered by automatic stations operated by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI). This is complemented by a one-year dataset of 10 gauges within a 5 km radius around CESAR (Cabauw Experimental Site for Atmospheric Research) {{in the center of the}} Netherlands. It is shown that it is possible to derive an average semi-variogram that describes the climatology of daily precipitation for each day of the year. Chapter 3. The study of chapter 2 is extended by investigating accumulation intervals shorter than daily scales. These are at 12, 8, 6, 4, 3, 2 and 1 -hour accumulation intervals. It is shown that at shorter temporal scales the behavior of semi-variograms of precipitation still shows a clear seasonal trend. At hourly and two-hourly accumulation intervals the signal of the range becomes fairly constant during the summer due to the limited accumulation period, the frequent occurrence of convective precipitation, and measurement errors. This illustrates the lower limit of using cosine functions to describe variogram parameters. By fitting a power-law function through the different cosine parameters it is possible to describe the semi-variance of precipitation at scales between 1 and 24 hours using a limited set of equations. Chapter 4. Different sources of error affecting rainfall estimates by weather radar are identified. By focussing on precipitation near a C-band radar some of these sources are reduced, which allows to focus on a limited set of error sources. These are radar calibration, ground clutter, <b>wet</b> <b>radome</b> attenuation and variations in rain drop size distribution. An event that caused high precipitation amounts in a band along the center of the Netherlands and more than 50 ~mm near the radar between the 25 th and the 27 th of August 2010 is studied. Without any correction and by applying a standard Marshall-Palmer Z-R relation the radar is found to underestimate by approximately 50 % with respect to the rain gauge measurements. Using the sun for calibration a correction of 1 dB is applied. Clutter is corrected by subtracting a clear sky clutter map as this proves to provide better results than the standard doppler filter. Wet-radome attenuation is corrected by looking at the amount of attenuation at a known strong clutter pixel near the radar. Disdrometer data near the radar are used to derive accurate Z-R relations specific to the precipitation of the event. These corrections combined provide very promising results with a slight overestimation of the quantitative precipitation estimates (QPE) from the radar by 5 to 8 %. Chapter 5. An extensive dataset of 195 precipitation events measured by an X-band radar (SOLIDAR) is used to study precipitation at a high spatial resolution of 120 m and a high temporal resolution of 16 s. This study shows the benefit of using such high resolution X-band radars over flat terrain. The errors in the radar measurements are first assessed and corrected as well as possible by considering different techniques. These errors are calibration, ground clutter and attenuation. Finally, five strongly different precipitation events are studied in detail to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the X-band weather radar. Chapter 6. The variability and possible measurement methods of precipitation have been studied. It was shown that precipitation spatial and temporal variability has a clear statistical signal by analyzing variograms for different accumulation intervals. Weather radars were also shown to be able to give good estimates of precipitation at ground level as well as detailed information on the spatial variability. Some recommendations are given to perform follow up studies. For chapters 2 & 3 it is recommended to use a larger and more detailed dataset, which also incorporates Belgian and German data. This would allow the study of anisotropy in the semi-variograms as well as extending the analysis to accumulation times shorter than 1 hour and longer than 24 hours. For chapter 4 it is recommended to study pixels located further away from the radar. While other error sources would become more pronounced it would be possible to study the applicability of the proposed corrections at longer ranges. Studying the wet-radome attenuation with several strong clutter pixels near the radar would allow the study of wind-effects on wet-radome attenuation, possibly allowing corrections using measurements of (Doppler) wind-speed and direction. Finally, in chapter 5 it is recommended to study the successor of SOLIDAR, IDRA, which is currently operational at CESAR. This radar is a polarimetric radar, allowing a more detailed study of precipitation together with the data from other instruments at this location and the C-band radar of KNMI, which is located close to this location at approximately 23 km...|$|E
