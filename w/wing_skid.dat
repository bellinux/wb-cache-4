40|$|The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) {{are rapidly}} {{expanding}} and taking on new {{roles in the}} military. In the area of training and targeting vehicles, control systems are expanding the functionality of UAVs beyond their initially designed purpose. Aeromech Engineering’s NXT UAV is a high speed target drone that is intended to simulate a small aircraft threat. However, {{in the interest of}} increasing functionality, enabling NXT to accomplish <b>wings</b> level <b>skidding</b> turns provides the basis for a UAV that can simulate a threat from a missile. Research was conducted to investigate the aerodynamic and performance characteristics of a winged vehicle performing high acceleration skidding turns. Initially, a linear model was developed using small disturbance theory. The model was further improved by developing a six degree of freedom simulation. A controller using four loop closures and utilizing both rudder and aileron for control was developed. Any outside guidance system that navigates using a heading command can easily be integrated into this controller design. Simulations show this controller enables the NXT UAV to accomplish up to 3 G <b>wings</b> level <b>skidding</b> turns. Further testing, showed that the controller was able to tolerate significant turbulence, sensor noise, loop failures and changes within the plant dynamics. This research shows how it is possible for a winged UAV to easily maneuver using <b>wings</b> level <b>skid</b> turns...|$|R
2500|$|The PL-1 is {{constructed}} from fiberglass, with the wings {{made from a}} balsa-fiberglass sandwich that was laid up in a female mold. The wing was originally of [...] span, but this was quickly increased to [...] with tip extensions and finally the aircraft received a new [...] three-piece wing. The airfoil was an Irv Culver modification to the NACA 0012. The landing gear was a monowheel, with small <b>wing</b> tip <b>skids.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mixed {{construction}} high-wing cantilever monoplane flying boat. A fuselage of duralumin construction, metal-covered, {{square in}} cross-section, split into watertight compartments. A V-shaped bottom was single-stepped. Engine on struts above a fuselage, with a two-blade pusher propeller. Two-spar trapezoid wings with rounded ends, of wooden construction, plywood and canvas covered. A tail of wooden construction. Crew of two, sitting {{side by side}} in an open cockpit. Retractable landing gear: main gear folding under <b>wings,</b> rear <b>skid.</b> There were planned auxiliary floats under wings. Fuel tank 100 l.|$|R
5000|$|The Type E sat high off {{the ground}} to {{accommodate}} a large propeller, almost horizontally because of a long tailskid from the fuselage {{to the end of}} the rudder post. The main undercarriage had a pair of forward-projecting skids which reached from forward of the propeller almost to the trailing edge of the <b>wing.</b> Each <b>skid</b> carried a pair of wheels on a short axle [...] The skids were attached to the upper fuselage longerons with a pair of near vertical struts on each side and by further bracing to the lower fuselage longeron.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} fuselage is {{made from}} welded steel tubing, with all surfaces covered in doped aircraft fabric covering. Its 43 ft span wing is mounted above the rear seat and supported by parallel lift struts. The tail is cable-braced. The cockpit is open, without a windshield. The landing gear is a conventional arrangement for fixed wing powered aircraft, rather than the more common central monowheel used on gliders. A wooden skid is also mounted on the fuselage center line. In addition to the main landing gear the aircraft has a tail <b>skid</b> and <b>wing</b> tip <b>skids</b> {{in the form of}} tubular loops.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} composites. Its 13.1 m span, slightly forward-swept wing has an area of 13.2 m2. The landing gear is of a bicycle design, with a main wheel and a nose wheel, plus <b>wing</b> tip <b>skids.</b> The bubble canopy is in one piece and is removable. The light wing loading and low stall speed mean that the aircraft can be flown in the smallest thermals. The wings can be removed for ground transport {{on top of an}} automobile, while the fuselage is small enough to fit inside a van or to be secured to a small trailer.|$|R
50|$|At its root, {{the wing}} merged gently into the {{fuselage}} with small air intakes for the 1.47 kN (330 lbf) Turbomeca Palas engine {{built into the}} leading edge. The cockpit was placed just aft of the intakes and the long straight-edged fin, swept at about 75° and initially {{as wide as the}} cockpit, began immediately behind it, narrowing to a slightly swept trailing edge carrying a full depth rudder. Images recorded before the first flight show the Katy with a low bicycle undercarriage with <b>wing</b> tip <b>skids</b> but, {{by the time of the}} flight itself, this was replaced by a fixed, un-faired tricycle undercarriage.|$|R
50|$|Gliders have rigid <b>wings</b> {{and either}} <b>skids</b> or undercarriage. In {{contrast}} hang gliders and paragliders use the pilot's feet {{for the start}} of the launch and for the landing. These latter types are described in separate articles, though their differences from sailplanes are covered below. Gliders are usually launched by winch or aerotow, though other methods: auto tow and bungee, are occasionally used.|$|R
50|$|The initial model Lazair was a {{single-seater}} with a 36.3 ft wingspan and was {{powered by}} two 5.5 hp 100 cc Pioneer chainsaw engines, directly driving plastic propellers in tractor configuration. The {{main landing gear}} used 16 in wheels with a track of just 26 inches, which combined with the long wing span, meant that taxiing in more than 7 mi/h km/h of wind required a <b>wing</b> walker. Tail <b>skids</b> were fitted to the inverted V-tail.|$|R
5000|$|The {{test program}} at Goodyear's {{facilities}} near Wingfoot Lake, Akron, Ohio {{showed that the}} inflation could be accomplished with as little as 8 psi (544 mbar), less than a car tire. The flight test program had a fatal crash when Army aviator Lt. [...] "Pug" [...] Wallace was killed. The aircraft was in a descending turn {{when one of the}} control cables under the wing came off the pulley and was wedged in the pulley bracket, locking the stick. The turn tightened until one of the wings folded up over the propellor and was chopped up. With the wings flapping because of loss of air, one of the aluminum <b>wing</b> tip <b>skids</b> hit the pilot alongside the head, as was clear from marks on his helmet. Wallace was pitched out over the nose of the aircraft and fell into the shallow lake. His chute never opened. He may have been knocked unconscious and rendered unable to open it. Only 12 Goodyear Inflatoplanes were built, but development continued until the project was cancelled in 1973.|$|R
40|$|A crowd gathers where a jet {{landed in}} fence near a road. Crash Crew and law {{enforcement}} are on site. Photograph taken for a newspaper owned by the Oklahoma Publishing Company. Caption: "Jet Lands In Fence; Pilot Safe A Tulsa air national guard flier crashed his F- 80 Shooting Star through the 6 -foot fence bordering Tinker Air Force base Wednesday morning, but he suffered only minor injuries. Capt. J. H. Rodolf, member of the 125 th fighter-interceptor squadron based at Tulsa municipal airport, was pulled from the cockpit and rushed to the Tinker hospital. He suffered only lacerations and bruises {{on his chest and}} neck, was kept at the hospital for further observation. The air guardsman was unconscious when the rescue squad arrived at the scene, but recovered {{by the time he was}} transferred to the ambulance. He said he could see his plane was "undershooting" the runway as he approached the base from the west. He pushed the throttle forward, he said, but the plane failed to respond. The fighter craft first hit the ground about 200 feet west of the base, lost a wing tank and bounced up. It came down again, lost the other <b>wing</b> tank, <b>skidded</b> across Air Depot road and plowed through a 6 -foot steel fence. Dragging 12 posts of the fence from its nose, the plane kept sliding along the ground until it came to rest near a patrol road at the edge of the runway the flier was trying to make. Although fuel spilled on the ground, there was no fire. The accident occurred about 8 a. m. ...|$|R
25|$|Captain Lampe's {{oxygen mask}} failed {{and he left}} his seat to get a spare oxygen maskfrom that point he was never heard on the CVR again. It was {{believed}} that the fire had also cut off the oxygen supply to the spare oxygen mask, leaving Captain Lampe with no oxygen left {{to return to the}} pilot seat and fly the plane. The co-pilot was instructed to land on the airport's runway 12L. The aircraft was too high on the approach and the gear did not extend. The aircraft passed over the airport before making a tight turn. Bell attempted to turn towards Sharjah International Airport but unknowingly turned in the wrong direction. Radar contact was lost shortly thereafter at 15:42 UTC. The aircraft finally slammed into the ground at a shallow angle and at high speed in an unpopulated area between the Emirates Road and Al Ain Highway, barely missing Dubai Silicon Oasis. The aircraft hit right <b>wing</b> first and <b>skidded</b> a few meters, and exploded in a fireball, killing both pilots. Other than ATC, many initial reports came from pilots working for Emirates who were living in the community.|$|R
