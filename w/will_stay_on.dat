5|$|On August 15, 2017, {{water was}} {{restored}} to the fountain as a test run, with the intention that it <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> <b>on</b> until November, when the ice rink reopens. The water has been dyed with the 'Blue Lagoon' aquatic dye to control the growth of algae and bacteria. The nontoxic aquatic dye attenuates the penetration of light into the water, and tints the water blue.|$|E

25|$|Hanged bodies can be {{expected}} to show their own quantity and variety of flies. Also, the amount of time flies <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> <b>on</b> a hanged body will vary in comparison to one found on the ground. A hanged body is more exposed to air and thus will dry out faster leaving less food source for the maggots.|$|E
25|$|The lizards' {{communication}} is somewhat {{similar to their}} human counterparts. Like Nancy, Sarah is more open to the humans and more interested in their world. She is also emotional, and when Charlie asks her a question that is {{hard for her to}} understand (what she would do if Leslie disappeared), she becomes distraught, leading to a confrontation. Leslie shares Charlie's attitude; he does not trust the humans and regards most everything they say with skepticism. Despite these problems, {{at the end of the}} play, some measure of trust is reached between all of them. Leslie decides that he and Sarah <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> <b>on</b> land when Nancy and Charlie, albeit reluctantly, offer to help them.|$|E
500|$|In Libya and Egypt, the Innocence of Muslims trailer {{was blamed}} for violent protests in September 2012. YouTube stated that [...] "This video—which is widely {{available}} on the Web—is clearly within our guidelines and so <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> <b>on</b> YouTube. However, given the very difficult situation in Libya and Egypt we have temporarily restricted access in both countries." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{earliest}} use of {{the phrase}} [...] "Crime of 1873" [...] in congressional debate was by Colorado Senator Henry M. Teller, who on July 10, 1890, stated, [...] "the fight for free coinage [...] is on, and it <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> <b>on,</b> too, till {{the will of the}} people shall be heard in the enactment of a law that shall put silver back where it belongs and where it would have been but for the blunder or the crime of 1873". The act had long been referred to as a [...] "crime" [...] without the exact phrase being used; in one 1889 speech, Nevada Senator William M. Stewart called it a [...] "crime" [...] seven times. He had voted for it in 1873.|$|E
2500|$|The saying {{became a}} staple of Israeli speech. Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin co-opted the phrase as an {{election}} campaign slogan in 1981. [...] It was also used by former Soviet refusenik and Israeli Yisrael BaAliyah party leader and Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky, in 1998. [...] The Israeli National Lottery Board spoofed it in a television commercial, in which a winning racehorse with an American accent stated: [...] "We are on the racetrack, and we <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> <b>on</b> the racetrack." [...] Similarly, when Israel's Davis Cup team beat the powerhouse Russian Davis Cup team in a shocking victory in the 2009 Davis Cup tennis quarter-finals, Prime Minister Netanyahu telephoned the Israel Tennis Association Director General and echoed Brody's statement of over three decades earlier, saying: [...] "We're back on the map".|$|E
2500|$|Typical for {{the period}} was an {{exchange}} that occurred between Halsey {{and one of his}} staff officers in June 1943. South Pacific Command was expecting the arrival of an additional air group to support their next offensive. As a part of the long view of winning the war taken by Nimitz, upon its arrival at Fiji the group was given new orders to return stateside and be broken up, its pilots to be used as instructors for pilot training. South Pacific command had been counting on the air group for their operations up the Solomon chain. The staff officer who brought the dispatch to Halsey remarked [...] "If they do that to us we will have to go on the defensive." [...] The admiral turned to the speaker and replied: [...] "As long as I have one plane and one pilot, I <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> <b>on</b> the offensive." ...|$|E

50|$|Patent {{litigation}} proceedings are bifurcated, {{meaning that}} issues of infringement are tried separately (and {{in a separate}} venue) to invalidity. Normally infringement proceedings <b>will</b> be <b>stayed</b> (<b>on</b> application by the defendant) pending outcome of the invalidation hearing.|$|R
2500|$|On May 30, 2007, the American Heart Association {{launched}} 'Mission: Lifeline', a [...] "community-based initiative {{aimed at}} quickly activating the appropriate {{chain of events}} critical to opening a blocked artery to the heart that is causing a heart attack." [...] It is seen as complementary to the ACC's D2B Initiative. The program will concentrate on patient education to make the public {{more aware of the}} signs of a heart attack and the importance of calling 9-1-1 for emergency medical services (EMS) for transport to the hospital. In addition, the program will attempt to improve the diagnosis of STEMI patients by EMS personnel. According to Alice Jacobs, MD, who led the work group that addressed STEMI systems, when patients arrive at non-PCI hospitals they <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> <b>on</b> the EMS stretcher with paramedics in attendance while a determination is made {{as to whether or not}} the patient will be transferred. For walk-in STEMI patients at non-PCI hospitals, EMS calls to transfer the patient to a PCI hospital should be handled with the same urgency as a 9-1-1 call.|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, Giant Eagle {{introduced}} the [...] "Advantage Card", an electronic loyalty card discount system (already popular in many chains), as a sophisticated {{version of the}} obsolete stamp programs. The card was later modified to double as a video rental card for Iggle Video. [...] More recently the company has started the Fuelperks! program to entice customers. [...] This program allows customer the opportunity to earn 10 cents off each gallon of gas (20 cents in select markets) with fifty dollars worth of authorized purchases. In early 2009, Giant Eagle launched the Foodperks! program, mainly geared towards GetGo. This program allows customers who use their fuelperks at GetGo to also earn foodperks to save on groceries purchased at Giant Eagle. Every 10 gallons of gas purchased earns a 1% discount. This can be used up to 20% maximum at a time on a purchase of up to $300. Foodperks are good for 90 days and fuelperks are good for 60 days. If the customer has more than {{the price of gasoline}} or more than the 20%, those discounts <b>will</b> <b>stay</b> <b>on</b> their card {{for the remainder of the}} 90/60 days, and if they are not used by then, they expire. In February 2013, Giant Eagle announced that they would be discontinuing the Foodperks! program that month because it was [...] "a little too complex".|$|E
