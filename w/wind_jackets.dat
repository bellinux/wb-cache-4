40|$|<b>Wind</b> turbine <b>jacket</b> {{structures}} are complex structures, whose joints design is generally driven by fatigue.

The accuracy of the results is discussed for several mesh layouts. The influence of the mesh density, element shape and element type are investigated. Furthermore, a parametric study is performed in order to see the variation of the results for several diameters, thicknesses and brace inclination combinations. The hot-spot method is proved to be robust regarding mesh regularity. However, the efficiency of irregular mesh models is very low and a high number of elements is needed in order to find an asymptotic behaviour that tends to a constant solution for increasing mesh refinement.

40|$|Jacket support {{structures}} are a preferred solution for offshore wind turbines in deeper waters. Extensive knowledge exists {{in relation to}} its construction technique {{as well as its}} crucial components, but due to considerable cost pressure, continued optimization is essential for the future competitiveness of the concept in the offshore wind business. A significant share of the overall production costs of jacket structures is related to the joints connecting the tubular members. Hence, these joints along with their complex welds are of special interest in terms of cost reduction. The design of tubular joints is generally driven by fatigue resistance. Due to the size, complexity and cost of these joints, this is assessed by using detailed FE models. When defining a numerical model, assumptions have to be made. These decisions influence the obtained output. Several aspects that {{have an impact on the}} results of the models are found to require further research and are investigated within this project: (1) influence of using solid versus shell elements in the modelling of the joint members; (2) degree of accuracy of the Efthymiou equations; (3) influence of the carry-over effect in multiplanar KK-joints; (4) differences in the fatigue life predictions between the hot-spot and the effective notch stress methods. Guidelines recommend the use of both solid and shell theories for the definition of the FE models used in the hot-spot fatigue assessment. Both options are compared in terms of accuracy of the results and computational time. Generally speaking, significant differences are found between both models. The background of the differences is studied. The employment of the Efthymiou formulae is common in practice. These equations provide the SCF at the locations around the weld where they are found to be maximum. The use of this approach carries two sorts of uncertainty. One is directly related to the values that the equations predict. The second one stems from the lack of information on the results at the other positions around the weld. The output of this approach is compared with the results of numerical models. The validity of its use is quantified. Offshore <b>wind</b> <b>jacket</b> joints are mainly multiplanar KK-joints. Loading in the braces of one face of the jacket may yield significant carry-over effects on the out-of-plane braces connected to the same joint. A parametric comparison is carried out to study the accuracy of modelling the joint as a planar K-joint. In general, it is found that the carry-over effect cannot be neglected and the assumption is not accurate. The fatigue assessment of tubular joints by means of the hot-spot method is subjected to several assumptions that limit the optimization of the members. The notch concept is a more realistic method that is presented as an alternative. However, this method is not widely used in engineering practice due to the difficulties in building the numerical model and the high computational requisites. An algorithm to carry out the effective notch stress assessment, based on the sub-modelling technique, is proposed. A comparison of the fatigue life prediction, between the hot-spot and the effective notch methods, is presented. The latter method is found to predict a higher fatigue life for many of the situations tested. Furthermore, since this method allows for a more detailed modelling, the weld profile can also be designed in order to optimize the fatigue resistance. The weld slope is found to have a significant impact on the results...|$|R

Because of these conditions, the maintenance of these structures {{plays a key role in}} their reliability over time. The use of monitoring in such a case could allow drastic decrease of maintenance costs provided safe and reliable systems may be applied on site. In this context, IFSTTAR is currently working with several partners in a regional project called SURFFEOL (Survey and reliability of offshore <b>wind</b> turbines <b>jackets)</b> in order to provide to offshore wind farms developers such solutions. One of the main objectives of this project is to carry out health monitoring of a wind turbine steel foundation to determine damage factors in relation more particularly with corrosion and fatigue degradations. The presented work introduces our laboratory investigations concerning different electrochemical and nondestructive techniques used to monitor these damage mechanisms. Firstly, accelerated corrosion tests by artificial tidal cycle with natural seawater are described on carbon steel coupons with and without protective coating in order to monitor the evolution of corrosion versus time. Several parameters are measured during the test such as corrosion intensity, pH, corrosion potential and environmental parameters (temperature, seawater salinity, O 2 dissolved). Secondly, fatigue sensors and more classical strain gauges have been used before and during fatigue to monitor damage under normalized fatigue cycles. The tests were carried out on T welded joints until failure. For each case, the comparison of the different techniques allows concluding on their suitability.

40|$|Due to the {{variable}} and stochastic offshore environment, offshore wind turbines {{are prone to}} fatigue. Fatigue damage usually occurs as cracks and is an important indicator of the structure's condition and the remaining life-time. However, the detection of fatigue cracks today is very cumbersome and easier and more straight-forward methods are desirable. In this thesis, it is investigated whether fatigue damage can be identified or detected based on operational vibrations. The idea is that sensors like accelerometers are placed at the offshore wind turbine, for example at the relatively easily accessible tower, to monitor the structure's response over time. Changes of the dynamic characteristics over time might then be an indicator for structural damage. To this end, an offshore <b>wind</b> turbine <b>jacket</b> support structure model is developed in Matlab {{by means of the}} finite element method. Realistic operational conditions are assumed and loads from wind and waves calculated accordingly. Models to represent a crack in structural members are reviewed and suitable methods are combined and adapted to fit the present model. To account for measurement and model errors, a Kalman filter is implemented that gives an optimal estimate for the structure's response. The response is then calculated for an undamaged support structure model and a support structure model, where at a certain location a crack has been simulated. The severity of the damage is varied and the effects are investigated. In an eigenvalue analysis it is found that the effect of the damage on the eigenfrequencies is small. Higher local brace modes at the crack location are affected most, however in a small order of magnitude. Based on ambient vibrations due to wind and waves the response of the support structure is investigated. In an attempt to amplify the deviation between the undamaged and the damaged support structure, a forced harmonic vibration is introduced into the system. </p...|$|R

A wind turbine and its substructure are usually exposed to environmental loadings (i. e. wind, waves) and described by computer simulations.

Firstly, the thesis is to indicate the areas of the largest fatigue damage accumulation in the remaining structure members and to estimate their ultimate strength. The fatigue evaluation of the steel structure elements is based on the Palmgren-Miner linear damage hypothesis. The steel brace member damage has been modelled by reducing the elastic modulus (Young's modulus) or inserting a free-joint mechanism {{in the middle of the}} element. Then the results of structure strength calculations before and after damage are collected and compared. Secondly, the analysis assumes a reduction in the fatigue loads applied to the support structure by changing the wind turbine control system. These changes are aimed at decreasing mainly the rotor revolution frequency and generator torque at the same time. The adjustment is achieved by varying a turbine blade pitch. The controller has also been modified to avoid continuous turbine operation at frequencies close to resonance...|$|R

As {{a part of the}} installation the jacket is lowered down to the seabed from a free hanging configuration, supported by a hydraulic frame. This operation is analyzed by use of the computer program Orcaflex, where the structure is modeled as rigid. Two critical scenarios are identified. In Scenario 1 a the jacket is 10 m above seabed. Here, the jacket may collide with the support frame if the motions are sufficiently large. In Scenario 2 a, the jacket is 3 m above seabed, and large motions may cause troubles under installation. Both these Scenarios are modeled and investigated by running response analyses in Orcaflex. The effect of applying a passive heave compensation system is also investigated. Damping characteristics for the system are provided by Ingenium. By these damping characteristics, the heave compensation system is implemented in the Orcaflex models. Contact between the support frame and the jacket legs may occur if the jacket motions are sufficiently large.

40|$|Presently {{fixed support}} {{structures}} are mainly {{used in the}} offshore wind industry, e. g. monopile, tripod, gravity base, et al., where the water depth are usually less than 30 m. Research work is ongoing for deeper water depth. Jacket substructure is very competitive in moderate water depth like 40 - 100 m, due to its light weight, high stiffness and efficient construction. Due to the harsh offshore environments, the fatigue performance of welded connections in jacket support structure is therefore a design driving criterion for successful operation of <b>jacket</b> <b>wind</b> turbines. In addition, {{as one of the}} most expensive components of the wind turbine system, gearbox has experienced higher-than-expected failure rates in the wind energy industry. In order to refine the design and make a better balance between the target safety levels and the project costs, and hence increase the long-term reliability of gearbox, more reasonable probabilistic design methods are desired. Compared with the jacket platforms used in the offshore oil and gas industry, the dynamic response analysis of <b>jacket</b> <b>wind</b> turbine subject to stochastic wind and waves loads simultaneously is more complicated. In this thesis, a decoupled procedure is applied for the dynamic response analysis of a fixed <b>jacket</b> offshore <b>wind</b> turbine (NREL 5 MW) designed for a North Sea site in a water depth of 70 m in time domain. The time series of each of the nominal stresses in 4 different tubular joints with respect to geometry and location in the jacket support structure for each shortterm environmental condition (wind/sea state) are obtained separately, and then superimposed together. The hot-spot stress ranges at the critical hot-spot locations of each joint are obtained by using rainflow counting method. The long-term probability distribution of the hot-spot stress ranges due to wind and wave loads is investigated. The contributions to fatigue damage from wind loads, wave loads and the interaction effect of wind and wave loads are identified with consideration of three different load cases: wind loads only, wave loads only and a combination of wind and wave loads, from a long-term point of view. Strength degradation due to the effect of harsh offshore environment, e. g. corrosion, has an influence on the fatigue reliability of tubular joints since the service life of offshore wind turbines is usually taken as 20 years. In order to maintain safety of offshore wind turbines in service life with respect to fatigue, wear and other deterioration phenomena especially, inspection, monitoring and repair are important measures. In this thesis, a general simplified probabilistic corrosion model is presented and used to modify the long-term hot-spot stress ranges, which can be used to account for the influences of the increased hot-spot stress range due to changes of nominal stress and stress concentration factors (SCFs) produced by the thickness thinning effects of the reference brace, the planar brace and the chord of tubular joint due to corrosion wastage. The fatigue reliability of tubular joints considering the effects of corrosion and inspection is investigated. The main uncertainties in the whole time domain analysis procedure are identified and analyzed. The sensitivity of the reliability index on important random variables is estimated. Another problem discussed in this thesis is time domain based contact fatigue analysis of gears in wind turbine drivetrain. Three practical problems in time domain modeling and analysis of dynamic gear contact force in wind turbine gearbox with respect to fatigue assessment are discussed: (1) torque reversal problem at low wind speeds conditions, (2) statistical uncertainty due to time domain simulations and (3) simplified postprocessing method for long term gear contact fatigue analysis. A simplified predictive pitting model for estimating gear service lives is presented and validated by comparing with the published experimental evidence. The model is applied to estimate the contact fatigue lives of the sun gear and the planetary gears in the drivetrain system of a 750 kW land-based wind turbine under stochastic dynamic conditions. The long-term probability distribution of the maximum gear contact pressure at a certain contact point is investigated.
