25|$|In {{keeping with}} the {{agreement}} that she <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> see her father again, Elisabeth Fritzl gave videotaped testimony before Austrian prosecutors and investigators on 11 July 2008.|$|E
25|$|Elisabeth did {{not provide}} police with more details until they promised her that she <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> see her father again. Over the next two hours, she {{told the story of}} her 24 years in captivity. Elisabeth told the police that her father raped her and forced her to watch pornographic videos. To humiliate her, he made her reenact scenes from the videos with him in front of her children. Shortly after midnight, police {{officers}} completed the three pages of minutes of the interrogation. Josef Fritzl, aged 73, was arrested on 26 April 2008 on suspicion of serious crimes against family members.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} the {{football}} rivalry between Argentina and Brazil {{can be traced to}} before football became so popular in both countries. Today, few remember wars and other political confrontations between both countries, and only recall matches, victories, goals and other sport-related incidents. Their rivalry is found in almost all sports, but a men's football match between Argentina and Brazil is one that neither side wants to lose, and often acquires more importance than the championship within which it takes place. To exemplify the intensity of this rivalry, one only needs to remember that after the 1946 incidents (see below), the two teams did not play against each other for ten years; either team would decline to play a given cup so that they <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> play against the neighboring country.|$|E

500|$|By July 2007, Watson's {{work in the}} Harry Potter {{series was}} said to have earned her more than £10million, and she {{acknowledged}} she <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> work for money again. In March 2009, she was ranked 6th on the Forbes list of [...] "Most Valuable Young Stars", and in February 2010, she was named as Hollywood's highest paid female star, having earned an estimated £19million in 2009.|$|E
500|$|The {{quest for}} 'genetic perfection' is a pseudo-religious concept to Zerg that drives {{them on a}} steady state of {{evolution}} and conflict; the zerg believed there was a state that the zerg could reach where they no longer needed to evolve, that their evolutionary form <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> change again because they could already adapt to any situation. Abathur, an evolution master, doubted that this was possible, but reasoned that [...] "chasing the illusion of perfection" [...] was, regardless, tactically sound.|$|E
500|$|Pascal {{continues}} {{to live with}} Rapunzel at the castle of Corona. Although he seems to like helping Rapunzel adjust to her new royal life, he eventually starts to feel he doesn't belong with her and runs away, to Rapunzel's isolated tower in the deepest parts of the forest. In Episode 11, it is revealed that, as a baby, his mother had sent him to safety on a lily-pad to escape a ravenous snake that was pursing them. As his mother was eaten by the snake, he had floated down a waterfall, where he heard [...] young Rapunzel singing. He climbed her tower but was still being followed by the snake which infected him with its lethal venom. It was then that the young Rapunzel used the light-based, healing magic of her blond hair to return him to life. She welcomed the infant chameleon as her best friend, that way they <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be alone again.|$|E

500|$|The {{quest for}} 'purity' was {{retained}} in the zerg psyche, becoming a pseudo-religious concept to them. Through the quest for 'perfection' the zerg were set on a steady state of evolution and conflict. The core idea of this 'religion' {{was that there was}} a state that the zerg could reach where they no longer needed to evolve, that their evolutionary form <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> change again because they could already adapt to any situation. Abathur accepts that the Overmind's instinctive desire for [...] "true perfection" [...] is impossible for the zerg swarm to achieve, yet reasoned that [...] "...chasing perfection was tactically sound regardless." [...] Instead, Abathur believed it is [...] "purpose" [...] which makes the zerg strong. Abathur states that without an overriding will, [...] "feral zerg" [...] are lesser than beasts, much like he was after the death of the Overmind. Abathur is personally responsible for the continuation of the zerg-species. He undertakes each experiment as though the survival of the species depends on it alone, and tolerates no genetic regression or evolutionary backstep. It is revealed in Heart of the Swarm that {{he was the one who}} designed the Queen of Blades.|$|E
2500|$|In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt {{engaged the}} {{architectural}} firm of McKim, Meade & White to renovate {{and expand the}} White House. [...] Their intention was to three-fold: To modernize the White House, to establish a decorating motif that <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be altered, and to recreate the White House's early American interiors. Although this last guideline was followed in most rooms, {{it was not in}} the East Room. McKim, Meade & White drew their inspiration for the East Room from British and French manor house interiors of the 1790s. Nonetheless, the Colonial Revival style was more of an idealized than historically accurate aesthetic, and McKim, Mead & White's interiors reflected a tendency toward light-filled spaces and away from patterns and [...] "busy" [...] or cluttered spaces.|$|E
2500|$|Other critics {{claim that}} there is a {{difference}} between artificial and extraordinary means of preservation, such as medical treatment, kidney dialysis, and blood transfusions, and normal and natural means of preservation, such as gestation, childbirth, and breastfeeding. They argue that if a baby was born into an environment in which there was no replacement available for her mother's breast milk, and the baby would either breastfeed or starve, the mother would have to allow the baby to breastfeed. [...] But the mother <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> give the baby a blood transfusion, no matter what the circumstances were. [...] The difference between breastfeeding in that scenario and blood transfusions is the difference between using your body as a kidney dialysis machine, and gestation and childbirth.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{should not}} have talked about it at all," [...] said Winterbourne; [...] "he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> {{proposed}} <b>to</b> a young lady of this country to walk about the streets with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you only}} wrote that letter {{to throw them}} on to a false scent, Bill? Who put you up to that, for I am sure it <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> {{occurred}} <b>to</b> you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] she retorted, [...] "it's a {{sure thing}} you <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> tried <b>to</b> be equal to it again. Anyway, I didn't feel anxious about you. You looked real amusing, Mavy." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 1968, Lowe {{was cast}} in his best remembered role, as Captain Mainwaring in the BBC sitcom Dad's Army (1968–1977). His colleagues on the show later remarked that the role resembled Lowe, pompous and bumbling; Lowe had a clause written into his contract, specifying that he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> lose his trousers. He also played Mainwaring's drunken brother Barry Mainwaring, in the 1975 Christmas episode [...] "My Brother and I". Lowe and his {{character}} also surfaced in a radio version of Dad's Army, a stage play and a feature-length film released in 1971. While Dad's Army was not in production, Lowe appeared in plays at the National Theatre and the Royal Court Theatre. In 1968 Lowe was invited by Laurence Olivier to act at the National Theatre at the Old Vic and appeared in Somerset Maugham's Home and Beauty in 1968 and later The Tempest in 1974 with John Gielgud.|$|E
2500|$|The Sanghata Sutra {{was another}} text that was saved {{thanks to an}} early Khotanese {{translation}} that dates {{as early as the}} 5th century C.E. [...] The sutra argues that all sentient beings are connected to enlightenment. [...] Because everyone is connected to the goal enlightenment, one <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> worry about being disconnected from the path of enlightenment. [...] Since those who recite the sutra reportedly recite the exact words that the Buddha spoke during his lifetime, the person who recites the text offers his or her voice to serve as a channel by which the Buddha’s presence within his teachings can spread across the world. [...] Prior to the discovery of the Sanskrit original in 1931 the Khotanese translation was the oldest surviving manuscript of the sutra. [...] While it was most popular within Central Asia, the sutra’s influence has since expanded to {{become an integral part of}} Tibetan and Chinese Buddhism as well, as more localized and more expansive translations have been found within those societies.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{sure if it}} hadn't {{been for}} me he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> come <b>to</b> the house, and you <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> known {{what he thought of}} you," [...] Mrs. Penniman rejoined, with a good deal of justice.|$|R
60|$|Now it so chanced that I was {{thinking}} of her at that moment. It <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> done <b>to</b> say this, so I stammered. And Miss Thorn {{was a young woman}} of tact.|$|R
60|$|Now what a happy {{idea that}} was!--and so simple; yet it <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> {{occurred}} <b>to</b> me. I was born modest; not all over, but in spots; {{and this was}} one of the spots.|$|R
2500|$|Once {{again at}} home in New York, she and her old friend screenwriter Frances Marion, worked on an unproduced play for Zasu Pitts. A few romances came her way, {{including}} Maurice Chevalier. Two Broadway producers had their eye on a musical version of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and brought in Joseph Fields as co-author. After initial stops and starts, Loos threatened to quit the production unless they assured her she <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> speak to Fields again. The show opened in Philadelphia with a then-unknown Carol Channing. By the time it arrived in New York it was another success. Channing soon was elevated to an A-list star, the show played for 90 weeks and went on tour for another year. The producers closed the show when Channing became pregnant. Herman Levin commented: [...] "I was convinced the show wouldn't work without Carol, and in my opinion it never has." [...] A musical film version was produced in 1953, directed by Howard Hawks and adapted by Charles Lederer. It starred Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe. Loos {{had nothing to do}} with the production, but thought Monroe was inspired casting.|$|E

6000|$|So Adam and Seth, {{with their}} mother between them, wound their {{way down to the}} valley and up again to the old house, where a saddened memory had taken the place of a long, long anxiety--where Adam <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> ask again as he entered, [...] "Where's Father?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, if {{you choose}} to take it in that way--A man can't do more than beg pardon! I'm sure I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> presumed <b>to</b> touch you if I had known it was your Dolorousness.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Of course," [...] Philip {{echoed in}} a tone of perfect conviction; it <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> {{occurred}} <b>to</b> him to doubt for a moment that everybody knew intuitively those beggarly elements of the inspired British monetary system.|$|R
60|$|Clever Gaston! how {{subtle and}} how shrewd! she <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> come {{to meet him}} on this ground, but he called to her. He came to fetch her, as it were, and led her along the road. He did not offer to guide her faltering footsteps, he {{simulated}} lameness, and asked for assistance instead of offering it.|$|E
6000|$|... "About half an {{hour after}} he {{disappeared}} we heard the explosion. But he didn't come back. We waited till the cool of sunset, {{and down on the}} beach found what had become of him. The boat was there all right, grounded by the prevailing breeze, but there was no Olaf. He <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> eat coconut again. We went back, shakier than ever, and cracked another square-face.|$|E
6000|$|One {{thing was}} quite sure; that all joy {{had gone out}} of her life. It was {{possible}} that love was still there--she did not know--she was too young to understand the complex sensations which suddenly had made a woman of her ... but it was a joyless love now: and all that she knew of a certainty about her own feelings at the present was that she hoped she <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> gaze into her lover's face again ... and ... Heaven help her! ... that he might never touch her again with his lips.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{admire him}} exceedingly,” Mrs. Blunt was {{saying in a}} tone which {{was not at all}} maternal. “His distinction, his fastidiousness, the earnest warmth of his heart. I know him well. I assure you that I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> dared <b>to</b> suggest,” she {{continued}} with an extraordinary haughtiness of attitude and tone that aroused my attention, “I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> dared <b>to</b> put before him my views of the extraordinary merits and the uncertain fate of the exquisite woman of whom we speak, if I had not been certain that, partly by my fault, I admit, his attention <b>has</b> been attracted <b>to</b> her and his—his—his heart engaged.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I know,' said Checco, 'but he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> dared <b>to</b> behave thus {{unless he}} knew of some design of Girolamo.' He paused a moment to think, then turning to me again, 'You must not {{challenge}} him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> dared <b>to</b> {{bring him}} on board your balancelle," [...] he once apologized to me. [...] "But what am I to do? His mother is dead, {{and my brother}} has gone into the bush." ...|$|R
