6000|$|... "Oh, Robert!" [...] cried his mother, {{with tears}} in her loving eyes, [...] "you don't know how we've all <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> for the past week!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am tired}} with travelling," [...] she murmured, [...] "and I hate Chicago, and I have <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>you.</b> Day by day I {{have read the}} papers. Everything has gone well?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He stops her, however, as she {{is leaving}} the room. [...] "Don't go in to him now," [...] he says; [...] "he will <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>you.</b> Wait till to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here you are, Peg, {{the last}} one. I was beginnin' to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>you.</b> Have your trunk taken right up, third floor back. Hurry down, for dinner {{will be ready}} soon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Now, tell {{us where}} your wigwam is, pappoose,' says John Tom--'where you live? Your mamma will be <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> being out so late. Tell me, and I'll take you home.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] he said, {{glancing at}} the clock over the door. [...] "Where have you been?--where were you this morning? I was <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> I--I was afraid you might be sick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It’s {{a proper}} feeling. I find no fault with it. Anyway, I’m {{glad to see}} that this time you’re looking nearer your own level. I felt a bit <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> some years ago.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm glad to {{find you}} so much better," [...] she said, going to his bedside. [...] "I've hardly slep', I was so much <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>you.</b> Your breakfast is ready, Mr. Hartley. I've got {{something}} special for Albert." ...|$|E
5000|$|Melody Maker (11/28/00, p. 52) - 3.5 stars out of 5 - [...] "Wonderfully demented thrash....this is south-of-the-border murderous noise, {{absolutely}} {{bereft of}} anything approaching accessibility....here's a record your parents will <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> owning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} big miner drily, [...] "there's very little <b>you</b> need <b>worry</b> <b>about.</b> <b>You</b> see, that young trooper isn't fond of me, {{and there was}} a kind of unpleasantness when we ran up against each other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well!" [...] {{replied the}} other, {{and as she}} slowly rose she added: [...] "I won't {{say that he is}} {{perfectly}} distracted <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> but I do know that he thinks more of you than of any other woman in the world, and I've no doubt he is <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> this minute." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{will recover}} fast now," [...] the countess said; [...] "but he has <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> night and day, Ronald. I {{hope that you}} will stay with us for a time. We have seen so little of you yet." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{should think}} you were! Ma was awfully <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>you.</b> When you weren't in by ten, that hateful Tom McGill {{said you were}} out calling on another--said you were out calling on some young lady. I just despise Mr. McGill. Well, I'm not going to scold you any more, Mr. Tansey, {{if it is a}} little late--Oh! I turned it the wrong way!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{do as you}} like, Bob," [...] {{she went}} on. [...] "I won't <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> in future--only {{if you have to}} go back to England without a leg, or an arm, don't blame me; and be sure you tell uncle that I made as good a fight against it as I could." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> her," [...] advised Dorothy. [...] "She didn't <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> and her {{condition}} is {{no worse than}} the condition she imposed on poor Woot. She can't starve {{to death in the}} Land of Oz, that's certain, and if she gets hungry at times it's no more than the wicked thing deserves. Let's forget Mrs. Yoop; for, in spite of her being a yookoohoo, our fairy friends have broken all of her transformations." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Anne, don't talk so," [...] said Marilla, {{genuinely}} alarmed lest Anne were drifting {{into deep}} and dangerous waters. [...] "We can't understand--but {{we must have}} faith--we MUST believe that all is for the best. I know you {{find it hard to}} think so, just now. But try to be brave--for Gilbert's sake.

6000|$|... "Where HAVE {{you been}} a-loafing to, you good-for-nothing trash! I've been that <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> I didn't {{know what to}} do. Your traps has been here ever so long, and I've had supper cooked fresh about four times so as to have it hot and good when you come, till at last my {{patience}} is just plumb wore out, and I declare I--I--why I could skin you alive! You must be starving, poor things!--set down, set down, everybody; don't lose no more time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know I've {{always admired}} you, Hugh,--I never had your ability," [...] he began painfully, [...] "you've gone ahead pretty fast,--the {{truth is that}} Perry and I have been <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> for some time. We've tried {{not to be too}} serious in showing it, but we've felt that these modern {{business}} methods were getting into your system without your realizing it. There are some things a man's friends can tell him, and it's their duty to tell him. Good God, haven't you got enough, Hugh,--enough success and enough money, without going into a thing like this Riverside scheme?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you really}} want {{somebody}} to <b>worry</b> <b>about,</b> <b>you</b> can help Mr. Orson to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> himself!" [...] the vice-consul went on, with the grimness he had formerly used in speaking of Mrs. Lander. [...] "He's sick, or he thinks he's going to be. He sent round for me this morning, and I found him in bed. You {{may have to go}} home alone. But I guess he's more scared than hurt." ...|$|R
5000|$|Later, Mars {{explained}} to Forbes {{that his own}} finances inspired him to write the tune.“I wouldn’t have to <b>worry</b> <b>about,</b> <b>you</b> know, ‘I can’t afford to get breakfast, so I’ll wait until lunchtime to eat,’” he said, explaining the song’s origins at his manager’s Hollywood Hills home. “If I was a billionaire, none of that would matter. I’d be eating diamond cereal.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{man like}} Bailey {{is worth a}} large salary to any one, even if {{he may not be}} able to start out for himself again immediately. I'm not <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> and Bailey. You will have {{forgotten}} all about this crash this time next year." [...] Sybil brightened up. She was by nature easily moved, and Ruth's words had stimulated her imagination.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes they would. THEY don't {{care what}} kind of music 'tis. A jews-harp's plenty good enough for a rat. All animals like music--in a prison they dote on it. Specially, painful music; and you can't get no other kind out of a jews-harp. It always {{interests}} them; they come out to see what's the matter with you. Yes, you're all right; you're fixed very well. You want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep, and early in the mornings, and play your jews-harp; play 'The Last Link is Broken'--that's the thing that 'll scoop a rat quicker 'n anything else; and when you've played about two minutes you'll see all the rats, and the snakes, and spiders, and things begin to feel <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> and come. And they'll just fairly swarm over you, and have a noble good time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it, Meg, for I've tried it, and I seldom {{give advice}} unless I've proved its practicability. When you and Jo were little, I went on {{just as you}} are, feeling as if I didn't do my duty unless I devoted myself wholly to you. Poor Father took to his books, after I had refused all offers of help, and left me to try my {{experiment}} alone. I struggled along as well as I could, but Jo {{was too much for}} me. I nearly spoiled her by indulgence. You were poorly, and I <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> till I fell sick myself. Then Father came to the rescue, quietly managed everything, and made himself so helpful that I saw my mistake, and never {{have been able to get}} on without him since. That is the secret of our home happiness. He does not let business wean him from the little cares and duties that affect us all, and I try not to let domestic worries destroy my interest in his pursuits. Each do our part alone in many things, but at home we work together, always." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, it's all right. There's {{nothing to}} <b>worry</b> <b>about.</b> Will <b>you</b> come up now?" [...] {{and he put}} his hand under his father's arm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{father is}} too busy {{discussing}} politics with Mr. 'Empseed to <b>worry</b> 'isself <b>about</b> <b>you</b> and the kitchen," [...] grumbled Jemima under her breath.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I do miss you, Will. But {{it will be}} {{pleasant}} to turn over in bed as often as I want to, without <b>worrying</b> <b>about</b> waking <b>you</b> up.|$|R
50|$|A {{few days}} later Ami is also the one who comes {{to the aid of}} Sayoko's sister, who has sprained her ankle when pushed on the platform. Ami can't {{understand}} whether the Japanese are kind or cold. They all look <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>you</b> but no one steps forward to help, she tells the girl.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{contains}} a secret message from 1:35 to 1:39 saying, [...] "She's <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> call your mother", if played backwards. According to [...] "franzferdinand.net," [...] bassist Bob Hardy {{was getting a}} bit worried about calling his mother back home, so the band added the backwards lyrics in as an homage. But Bob Hardy {{has said that he}} has no knowledge of the lyrics being there and he thought it was just a positive message to put on the track.|$|E
5000|$|By 1942, the Vichy {{government}} in unoccupied France also began excluding Jews from most professions, {{which led to}} Glanzberg's name now being kept off of concert programs. He {{changed his name to}} Pierre Minet and relied on a fake French passport to travel around the country. Piaf became more concerned for his safety, once writing him when they were apart, [...] "I'm <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>you.</b> I drink only water and tea, go to bed at midnight...Everyone says I look well. It must be love!" [...] She gave him the nickname [...] "Nono chéri" [...] ("darling Nono"), and wrote that he was her [...] "seul amour," [...] her only love. They were both unaware, as was most of France's population, that the Nazis planned to arrest some thirty thousand Parisian Jews, which they did two days after Bastille Day.|$|E
5000|$|On 26 November, Education Minister Dmytro Tabachnyk {{addressed}} Ukraine's students saying [...] "When 'hot heads' {{push you}} towards illegal actions, I hope {{you find the}} strength and courage not to succumb to provocations. Don't violate public order. Remember your parents and loved ones who always <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>you.</b> Be careful and vigilant! Take care of yourself! You have a great life ahead of you {{and you need to}} choose its direction and movement..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nurse {{tells me}} {{you are going to}} the Grevilles this evening. I am so glad. I've been <b>worrying</b> myself <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> moped up here right through the season." ...|$|R
5000|$|His cellmate {{commented that}} his son's [...] "handwriting was not bad", also {{a message for}} his dad: [...] "Dad, don't be naughty in prison, Don't let me <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>you,</b> remember..." [...] this {{sentence}} is meaningful, [...] "Tolerate, Tolerate, Tolerate...." [...] Ching was discharged from the hospital and was being brought back to his cell, an officer {{told him that he}} was lucky that he had an officer to stand witness for him about the fight.|$|R
