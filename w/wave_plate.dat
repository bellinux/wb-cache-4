25|$|Because the {{quarter-wave plate}} {{is made of}} a {{birefringent}} material, when in the <b>wave</b> <b>plate,</b> the light travels at different speeds depending on the direction of its electric field. This means that the horizontal component which is along the slow axis of the <b>wave</b> <b>plate</b> will travel at a slower speed than the component that is directed along the vertical fast axis. Initially the two components are in phase, but as the two components travel through the <b>wave</b> <b>plate</b> the horizontal component of the light drifts farther behind that of the vertical. By adjusting {{the thickness of the}} <b>wave</b> <b>plate</b> one can control how much the horizontal component is delayed relative to vertical component before the light leaves the <b>wave</b> <b>plate</b> and they begin again to travel at the same speed. When the light leaves the quarter-wave plate the rightward horizontal component will be exactly one quarter of a wavelength behind the vertical component making the light left-hand circularly polarized when viewed from the receiver.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, several {{methods have been}} {{proposed}} to automate photoelastic analyses.

25|$|To create right-handed, {{clockwise}} {{circularly polarized}} light one simply rotates {{the axis of}} the quarter-wave plate 90° relative to the linear polarizer.

25|$|There {{are several}} ways to create circularly {{polarized}} light, the cheapest and most common involves placing a quarter-wave plate after a linear polarizer and directing unpolarized light through the linear polarizer. The linearly polarized light leaving the linear polarizer is transformed into circularly polarized light by the quarter <b>wave</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
25|$|To {{create a}} {{circular}} polarizer that instead passes right-handed polarized light and absorbs left-handed light, one again rotates the <b>wave</b> <b>plate</b> and linear polarizer 90° relative to each another.

2500|$|Electromagnetic {{radiation}} is emitted by a light source and linearly polarized by a polarizer. It can pass through an optional compensator (retarder, quarter <b>wave</b> <b>plate)</b> and falls onto the sample. After reflection the radiation passes a compensator (optional) {{and a second}} polarizer, which is called an analyzer, and falls into the detector. Instead of the compensators, some ellipsometers use a phase-modulator {{in the path of}} the incident light beam. Ellipsometry is a specular optical technique (the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection). The incident and the reflected beam span the plane of incidence. [...] Light which is polarized parallel to this plane is named p-polarized (p-polarised). A polarization direction perpendicular is called s-polarized (s-polarised), accordingly.

40|$|We {{describe}} the Submillimeter Array (SMA) Polarimeter, a polarization converter and feed multiplexer {{installed on the}} SMA. The polarimeter uses narrow-band quarter-wave plates to generate circular polarization sensitivity from the linearly-polarized SMA feeds. The <b>wave</b> <b>plates</b> are mounted in rotation stages under computer control so that the polarization handedness of each antenna is rapidly selectable. Positioning of the <b>wave</b> <b>plates</b> {{is found to be}} highly repeatable, better than 0. 2 degrees. Although only a single polarization is detected at any time, all four cross correlations of left- and right-circular polarization are efficiently sampled on each baseline through coordinated switching of the antenna polarizations in Walsh function patterns. The initial set of anti-reflection coated quartz and sapphire <b>wave</b> <b>plates</b> allows polarimetry near 345 GHz; these plates have been have been used in observations between 325 and 350 GHz. The frequency-dependent cross-polarization of each antenna, largely due to the variation with frequency of the retardation phase of the single-element <b>wave</b> <b>plates,</b> can be measured precisely through observations of bright point sources. Such measurements indicate that the cross-polarization of each antenna is a few percent or smaller and stable, consistent with the expected frequency dependence and very small alignment errors.
