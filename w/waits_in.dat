5|$|E.T. is an {{adventure}} {{game in which}} players control an alien (E.T.) from a top-down perspective. The objective {{of the game is}} to collect three pieces of an interplanetary telephone. The pieces are found scattered randomly throughout various pits (also referred to as wells). The player is provided with an on-screen energy bar, which decreases when E.T. performs any actions (including moving, teleporting, or falling into a pit, as well as levitating back to the top). To prevent this, E.T. can collect Reese's Pieces, which are used to restore his energy or, when nine are collected, E.T. can call Elliott to obtain a piece of the telephone, or the player can save the candy pieces for bonus points at the end. After the three phone pieces have been collected, the player must guide E.T. to an area where he can use the phone, which allows him to call his home planet. When the call is made, E.T. must reach the spaceship in a given time limit. Once E.T. gets to the forest where his ship abandoned him and stands and <b>waits</b> <b>in</b> the designated area for the ship to come, the ship will appear on screen and take him back to his home planet. Then the game starts over, with the same difficulty level, while changing the location of the telephone pieces. The score obtained during the round is carried over to the next iteration. The game ends when the energy bar depletes. E.T. has three lives and if he dies within those three lives Elliot will come in and revive him. E.T. can get a fourth life if the player is lucky enough to find a geranium in one of the wells. It turns into a sprite from some games that Howard Scott Warshaw made, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] Strategic {{customers}} {{take their}} waiting time into consideration upon making decisions. While satisfactorily completed service increases utility of a customer, {{waiting to be}} served decreases this utility in a queueing type service system. <b>In</b> this system, <b>waiting</b> can be classified into two: <b>in</b> queue <b>waiting</b> and <b>in</b> service <b>waiting.</b> Unlike the literature, proposed model assumes <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> a queue, while other customers are being served, differs from <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> service where the former one decreases the utility of a customer more. This paper analyzes decision making of a customer under this assumption. Comparing decision of the customer under proposed assumption and literature assumption, this paper shows that <b>in</b> queue <b>waiting</b> differs <b>in</b> service <b>waiting.</b> Index Term [...] Strategic customer, M/M/ 1, <b>in</b> queue <b>waiting,</b> <b>in</b> service <b>waiting,</b> observable queues, unobservable queue...|$|R
