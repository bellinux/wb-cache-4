5000|$|Populus balsamifera, {{commonly}} called <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar,</b> bam, bamtree, eastern balsam-poplar, hackmatack, tacamahac poplar, tacamahaca, is a tree {{species in the}} <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar</b> species group in the poplar genus, Populus. The genus name Populus is from the Latin for poplar, and the specific epithet balsamifera from Latin for [...] "balsam-bearing". [...] Other common names for the species include heartleaf <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar,</b> and Ontario <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar.</b> The black cottonwood, Populus trichocarpa, is sometimes considered a subspecies of P. balsamifera and may lend its common name to this species, although the black poplars and cottonwoods of Populus sect.

40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Balsam</b> <b>poplar</b> is {{the northernmost}} tree species in North America, with a {{reported}} range that extends generally {{to the tree}} line across the continent and beyond the tree line in Alaska, where extralimital stands growing in Arctic ecosystems on the North Slope have been documented and studied. Here we summarize existing information and report new data on extralimital stands of <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar</b> from the Arctic ecozone in the northeastern mainland Northwest Territories. These occurrences extend the geographical and ecological range of the species fully into the mainland Canadian Arctic. In this region, <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar</b> is known from four sites: two in Tuktut Nogait National Park and two along the Hornaday and Brock rivers just beyond the northwestern Park boundary. <b>Balsam</b> <b>poplar</b> was first reported from two of these sites more than 50 years ago, but those data have not been considered in most subsequent floristic and ecological work. A <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar</b> grove in Tuktut Nogait National Park consists of four discrete stands of shrubby plants growing on a low ridge adjacent to the Hornaday River; their tallest ramets measure 1. 1 – 1. 86 m. A larger grove {{along the edge of}} the lower Brock River consists of three large stands, the tallest ramets measuring 3. 5 – 4 m. The boreal and subarctic regions of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut have large areas where <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar</b> has not been documented by herbarium specimens, including most of the forest-tundra and tree-line zones. Collections from these areas and other potential extralimital sites in the Canadian Arctic are urgently needed to document the current distribution of <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar.</b> Such data could serve as a baseline for assessing potential future alteration of the range of this species as a result of climate change...|$|R

50|$|Several hybrids between balsam poplars (particularly <b>western</b> <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar)</b> and the cottonwoods {{have also}} been {{developed}} for lumber production or for use as shade trees. These hybrids are selected for exceptionally fast growth and disease resistance.|$|E
50|$|Balsam poplars are {{cultivated}} {{mainly in}} parks for their ornamental, light-coloured bark and pleasant scent in spring. <b>Western</b> <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar</b> is also planted as a timber crop. The wood is soft, very light in weight, but strong for its weight, coarse and fibrous, does not polish or plane easily, {{and is used}} for pallet boxes and other similar rough uses.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>western</b> <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar,</b> black cottonwood, or California poplar P. trichocarpa is {{native to}} western North America, from Alaska south to {{northern}} California. It is the largest species of poplar, recorded to 65 m tall. It {{is also a very}} important species in plant biology. It was announced on 15 September 2006 in the journal Science that P. trichocarpa became the first tree species to have its entire genome sequenced. In the mountains of interior western North America, it is replaced by the willow-leaved poplar or narrowleaf cottonwood, P. angustifolia. P. trichocarpa is sometimes treated within P. balsamifera as P. balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2012 In the North American boreal forest, 21 st century {{climate change}} is {{projected}} to result in longer growing seasons, increased forest productivity, and northward expansions or shifts in species ranges. These projected impacts are largely based on observations across natural temperature gradients, e. g., latitude or altitude, or correlations between current species' distributions and modern climate envelopes. These approaches, although valuable, do not consider biological capacities important in a species' {{ability to cope with}} novel environments through physiological or phenological acclimation. Within a single species, adaptation to local environments may cause some populations to respond differently to climate change than others. Acclimation (phenotypic plasticity) is often treated as a separate phenomenon from local adaptation, but the latter may determine the range of acclimation responses or thresholds. To more accurately predict how boreal tree species will respond to a directionally changing climate, it is necessary to experimentally examine the effects of warming on the growth and physiology of individual species and how those effects differ across a species' range. [...] This research investigated how tree growth responses to increasing temperature are influenced by differences in adaptation and acclimation across the latitudinal range of the North American boreal forest tree, Populus balsamifera L. (<b>balsam</b> <b>poplar).</b> Warming experiments, both in the greenhouse and in the field, indicated that growth of <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar</b> trees from a broad latitudinal gradient responds positively to increased growing temperatures, with increases in height growth ranging from 27 - 69 % in response to 3 - 8 °C average warming. Genotypes from southern populations grew consistently taller in both field and greenhouse experiments. The field experiment enabled investigation into the effects of warming and source latitude on <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar</b> phenology; both experimentally warmed and southern individuals grew larger and exhibited longer growing seasons (more days of active growth). Lastly, I describe a theoretical/methodological framework for exploring the role of epigenetics in acclimation (plasticity) and adaptation to changing environments. The results from these experiments are integrated with information on adaptive gradients in <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar</b> to predict both the in situ responses of <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar</b> to increased temperatures, and the potential for northward range shifts in the species...|$|R
50|$|The {{forests are}} a mixture {{dominated}} by lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), jack pine (Pinus banksiana), trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides), black spruce (Picea mariana), and white spruce (Picea glauca). Other trees include <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar</b> (populus balsamifera), paper birch (Betula papyrifera) and balsam fir (Abies balsamifera).|$|R
50|$|The landscapes vary greatly. In the George River valley, {{there are}} forests of spruce and larch, and even birch and <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar,</b> {{which are usually}} present at lower latitudes.

25|$|The White Spruce Cover Type {{may include}} other species in small numbers. In Alaska, {{associates}} include paper birch, trembling aspen, <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar,</b> and black spruce; in western Canada, additional associates are subalpine fir, balsam fir, Douglas-fir, jack pine, and lodgepole pine (Dyrness 1980). Seral species {{giving way to}} white spruce include paper birch, aspen, <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar,</b> jack pine, and lodgepole pine. On certain river bottom sites, however, black spruce may replace white spruce (Viereck 1970a). Earlier successional stages leading to the white spruce climax are the white spruce–paper birch, white spruce–aspen, <b>balsam</b> <b>poplar,</b> jack pine, and lodgepole pine types. The type shows little variation. The forest is generally closed and the trees well formed, other than those close to the timberline. Lesser vegetation in mature stands is dominated by mosses. Vascular plants are typically few, but shrubs and herbs that occur “with a degree of regularity” include: alder, willows, mountain cranberry, red-fruit bearberry, black crowberry, prickly rose, currant, buffaloberry, blueberry species, bunchberry, twinflower, tall lungwort, northern comandra, horsetail, bluejoint grass, sedge species, as well as ground-dwelling mosses and lichens. Several white spruce communities {{have been identified in}} interior Alaska: white spruce/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/feathermoss; white spruce/dwarf birch/sphagnum; white spruce/avens/moss; and white spruce/alder/bluejoint (Viereck 1975, Dyrness 1980).|$|R
