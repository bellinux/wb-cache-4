5|$|It isn't a {{personal}} pain which has brought me here, {{as is the}} case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about <b>what</b> <b>took</b> place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{consensus}} about the outcome or <b>what</b> <b>took</b> place, with views ranging from an Egyptian victory to a draw, or, {{in the view of}} Iranian Egyptologist Mehdi Yarahmadi, an Egyptian defeat (with the Egyptian accounts simply propaganda).

According to Little Rock's account, a war party of about 200 Cheyennes from a camp above the forks of Walnut Creek {{departed}} camp intending to go out against the Pawnee. Instead, they raided white settlements along the Saline and Solomon rivers. Some of the warriors returned to Black Kettle's camp. Little Rock learned from them <b>what</b> <b>took</b> place.

25|$|Unlike the Hambledon {{players who}} tended to {{represent}} their club only, Stevens made appearances for just about every team, including Hambledon. He is normally associated with Surrey teams in general and with the famous Chertsey club in particular. He continued as a player until he was 50 and played his last match on 2–5 September 1789 for All-England v Hampshire at Sevenoaks Vine. It is not known <b>what</b> <b>took</b> place in his career following this game, but John Major suspected that Stevens enlisted in the British Army. On 20 May 1793 a letter signed by 'A Kentish Cricketer' written to Sporting Magazine describes an incident where an Ensign Hamilton, {{a member of the}} Sevenoaks Vine Club, had a cannonball deflected away from his head by a Sergeant. The magazine and the Maidstone Journal both linked the story to Stevens.|$|E
25|$|Godwin {{augmented}} {{the influence}} of Political Justice {{with the publication of}} a novel that proved equally popular, Things as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams. This {{tells the story of a}} servant who finds out a dark secret about Falkland, his aristocratic master, and is forced to flee because of his knowledge. Caleb Williams is essentially the first thriller: Godwin wryly remarked that some readers were consuming in a night <b>what</b> <b>took</b> him over a year to write. Not the least of its merits is a portrait of the justice system of England and Wales at the time and a prescient picture of domestic espionage. His literary method, as he described it in the introduction to the novel, also proved influential: Godwin began with the conclusion of Caleb being chased through Britain, and developed the plot backwards. Dickens and Poe both commented on Godwin's ingenuity in doing this.|$|E
25|$|In the 1953 essay, Journey to The Crucible, Miller {{writes of}} visiting Salem and feeling {{like the only}} one {{interested}} in what really happened in 1692. However, {{a long line of}} historians before Miller had attempted to record and tease apart the complexities of <b>what</b> <b>took</b> place at Salem, and certain battle lines had long before been drawn: Calef vs. Mather; Upham vs. Poole, skeptics or scholars vs. the faithful and the religious establishment. Miller's cursory and limited scholarship regarding the trials is lamentable, given the squabbling that has long taken place over various interpretations of the numerous details and facts. Many of Miller's characters were based on people who had little in the public record other than their statements from the trials, but others survived to expand, recant, or comment on the role they played at Salem, including jurors, accusers, survivors, and judges. Rev. Parris issued his {{first in a series of}} apologies on November 26, 1694, and was removed from his position in 1697. In 1698, Hale finished composing a lengthy essay about Salem that was reprinted by Burr in 1914.|$|E

500|$|With a major-label budget, the Paul Lani-produced So Far, So Good... So <b>What!</b> <b>took</b> {{over five}} months to record. The album was plagued with {{problems}} during production, partially due to Mustaine's struggle with drug addiction. Mustaine later said: [...] "The production of So Far, So Good... So What! was horrible, mostly due to substances and the priorities we had or didn't {{have at the}} time." [...] Mustaine clashed with Lani on several occasions, beginning with Lani's insistence that the drums be recorded separately from the cymbals, an unheard-of process for rock drummers. Mustaine and Lani became estranged during the album's mixing, and Lani was replaced by Michael Wagener, who remixed the album.|$|E
