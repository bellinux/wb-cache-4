5|$|After {{becoming}} extratropical, Charley re-intensified under baroclinic instability. The resulting {{storm was}} a very large and fairly strong gale that gradually moved across the northern Atlantic Ocean. As an extratropical cyclone, Charley attained an atmospheric pressure of 980 mbar, which was lower than its pressure as a tropical cyclone. On August 24, it spawned a separate extratropical cyclone, which initially moved northeastward before turning and dissipating near Spain. The remnants of Charley accelerated as it approached the British Isles, and after passing south of Ireland it moved across Great Britain on August 27. <b>While</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Sea, the cyclone weakened as it executed a counter-clockwise loop, and on August 30 the remnants of Charley dissipated near Denmark as a new circulation developed to its southwest.|$|E

25|$|Two {{physical}} components {{comprise the}} Bathurst region; the Bathurst Basin and the Tablelands areas.

The south is more complex geology with siltstones, sandstones, greywacke, shales and chert, basalt and granite intrusions and embedded volcanic and limestones. Underlying Bathurst is the dominant feature of Bathurst granite (intruded in the Devonian period) and at Mount Panorama and Mount Stewart basalt occurs.|$|E

25|$|On 21 August 1829 four company {{servants}} shot an Aboriginal {{woman in}} the back, then executed her with an axe at Emu Bay, near present-day Burnie. Violence continued in the region, with three company men fatally speared in July and October 1831 and heavy losses inflicted on sheep and oxen. The population of North West clans fell from 700 to 300 through the 1820s, <b>while</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> nation—where shepherds vowed to shoot Aboriginal people whenever they saw them—numbers had plummeted from 400 in 1826 to fewer than 60 by mid-1830.

25|$|The rupture {{between the}} allies, {{due to the}} Bulgarian claims, was inevitable, and Bulgaria found herself {{standing}} against Greece and Serbia. On 19 May 1913, a pact of alliance was signed in Thessaloniki between Greece and Serbia. On 19 June, the Second Balkan War began with a surprise Bulgarian assault against Serbian and Greek positions. Constantine, now King after his father's assassination in March, neutralized the Bulgarian forces in Thessaloniki and pushed the Bulgarian army further back {{with a series of}} hard-fought victories. Bulgaria was overwhelmed by the Greek and Serbian armies, <b>while</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>north</b> the Romanian army was marching towards Sofia; the Bulgarians asked for truce. Venizelos went to Hadji-Beylik, where the Greek headquarters were, to confer with Constantine on the Greek territorial claims in the peace conference. Then he went to Bucharest, where a peace conference was assembled. On 28 June 1913 a peace treaty was signed with Greece, Montenegro, Serbia and Romania on one side and Bulgaria on the other. Thus, after two successful wars, Greece had doubled its territory by gaining most of Macedonia, Epirus, Crete {{and the rest of the}} Aegean islands, although the status of the latter remained as yet undetermined and a cause of tension with the Ottomans.|$|E

25|$|National {{overview}} of water resources. Water resources are scarce in Burkina Faso. Water availability varies greatly between regions and seasons, {{as well as}} from year to year. In the South, average rainfall is as high as 1,200mm during a six-month wet season, <b>while</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> the wet season lasts only three months and rainfall is only 300mm. The only rivers in the country that carry water all year around are the Mouhoun River (Black Volta) and the Nakambe River (White Volta), the other rivers carrying water only during the wet season. Building dams has been the most common way of storing water for the dry season, even though evaporation can reach 2,000mm/year thus causing substantial water losses from open reservoirs. A substantial portion of surface water resources is shared with neighboring countries. For example, the Nakambe River - the main source of supply for the capital, Ouagadougou - and the Mouhoun River are shared with Ghana. Surface water resources vary between 8 billion cubic meters (BCM)/year in an average year and 4 BCM in a dry year. The lower figure corresponds to less than 300 cubic meters per capita and year, which is well below the level of 1,000 cubic meters per capita and year that is considered the threshold for “water stress”.|$|E
25|$|Luftwaffe {{attacks on}} {{shipping}} were made much easier by {{the capture of}} bases in France and the Low Countries, <b>while</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Sea, the Grimsby fishing fleet was attacked twice in June. Air attacks increased and in July, ship losses off the east coast exceeded those by naval mines. Attacks on minesweepers, escort vessels and anti-invasion patrols rapidly increased and was made worse {{by a lack of}} light anti-aircraft guns and the concentration of the air defence effort in the south-east of England, against a possible invasion. The Admiralty reserved the right for ships to fire on aircraft on an apparently attacking course, because it had been found that a high volume of prompt, accurate fire could reduce the accuracy of bombing and sometimes shoot down the attacker. Hurried training and lack of experience in aircraft recognition among navy crews led to many RAF aircraft being taken for hostile and fired on, even escorts for the ships. While demanding close escort, the Admiralty required ships to engage unidentified aircraft within , a practice the RAF considered irresponsible. More training in aircraft recognition and pilots not flying towards to ships on tracks similar to bomb runs were obvious remedies and with experience, navy gunners made fewer mistakes.|$|E
25|$|Designs by Duarte D'Armas (1509-1510) show {{a castle}} with {{circular}} barbican and rounded western entrance with machillitons. The southern battlements were decorated with parralleleptical merlons, <b>while</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>north</b> (which {{was in a}} state of semi-ruin) was a false gate. To the south of the entrance was a cylindrical corbel with two orders of cruciform battlements, without merlons and with intermittent vaults. The castle, also circular, was circuited by various towers and corbels of varying sizes and forms. In the extreme east, alongside the false gate is a rectangular tower of two registers, with ceiling tile, two small windows in the north and another in the south, a balcony with machillotians, with another two crowning the walls linking to the tower keep. The rectangular keep tower with facade crack, is marked by merlons with three balconies with machilliations; Duarte D'Armas indicated in the legend that the tower was four registers, with a last floor topped with vaulted ceiling. Following this is a smaller pentagonal tower, crowned with machialliations. On the right of the principal gate is a hexagonal corbel with balcony and machicolations and surmounted by two bell towers with two iron crosses, one with two bells and another referred to as d'El-Rei. On the left is a taller octagonal tower with comparable damage, crowned by machicolations with merlons. In the north is a hexagonal corbel, followed by a semi-circular corbel, rectangular ledge and a new hexagonal corbel with balcony and machicolations. In the castle courtyard are two cisterns. On the outside of the castle, to the west, are town homes, the parochial church in the east (with a Manueline doorway), the Church of Santa Maria de Vilar in the west and farther to the north, the Chapel of São Brás. In the east are cultivatable lands, extending to the Douro River and the Castilian castle of Vilibestre.|$|E
