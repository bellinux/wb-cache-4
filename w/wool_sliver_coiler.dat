40|$|Due to {{peculiar}} {{characteristics of}} wool fibres, open-end rotor spinning {{system is not}} employed in wool spinning as in cotton. The problems are related with the combing of the feeding system where the combing cylinder damages the fibres producing breakage. In this study, combing system based on drawing cylinder and nipping by aprons is studied. The drawing is carried out noncontinueusly by nipping. The results obtained are {{compared with those of}} the pressure combing cylinder and flat feeding. It is shown that in the system of combing through drawing, a more uniform combing of the <b>wool</b> <b>sliver</b> is obtained as compared to the pressure combing cylinder system. It is also less sensitive to the type of finish employed. The yarns obtained have relatively high tenacity and are more regular than those spun by conventional woolen system. They can be considered quite suitable for Ladies wear and knitted fabrics...|$|R
40|$|Photoyellowing of wool is {{a serious}} problem for the wool industry. This study {{assessed}} the role of photocatalytic nanocrystalline titanium dioxide (P- 25) as a potential antagonist or catalyst in the photoyellowing of wool. Untreated, bleached and bleached and fluorescent-whitened <b>wool</b> <b>slivers</b> were processed into fine wool powders for the purpose of even and intimate mixing with the TiO 2 nanoparticles in the solid state. Pure wool and wool/TiO 2 mixtures were then compressed into solid discs for a photoyellowing study under simulated sunlight and under UVB and UVC radiations. Yellowness and photo-induced chemiluminescence (PICL) measurements showed that nanocrystalline TiO 2 could effectively reduce the rate of photoyellowing by inhibiting free radical generation in doped wool, and that a higher concentration of TiO 2 contributed to a lower rate of photooxidation and reduced photoyellowing. Hence nanocrystalline TiO 2 acts primarily as a UV absorber on wool in dry conditions and not as a photocatalyst. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The self-developed {{processing}} {{technology of}} slenderized <b>wool</b> and mercerized <b>sliver,</b> fiber performances and technology of blended yarns were introduced. High quality natural fiber blended yarns were obtained through blended spinning of secant slenderized wool and mercerized cotton under certain proportion...|$|R

Wood <b>wool</b> (i.e. wood <b>slivers)</b> {{have been}} a substrate of choice since the earliest days of the hydroponics research.

25|$|Combing {{straightens}} the fibres, isolates {{the long}} ones (tops) for spinning and discards the short ones (noil). There are {{various types of}} combing machines here, including the French comb, the Lister comb and the Holden comb. The Noble comb {{was the most popular}} as it would comb long, medium and fairly short staple <b>wool,</b> but the <b>slivers</b> needed special preparation in a punching machine beforehand.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studied the}} wool and alpaca fibre {{curvature}} and its variation during the fibre processing. It revealed {{the effect of}} wool fibre crimp on the cohesion properties of alpaca and <b>wool</b> blended <b>slivers.</b> Different <b>wool</b> and alpaca tops were blended via a number of gillings, {{and the role of}} wool fibre curvature in alpaca/wool blend processing has also been investigated. During the wool fibre processing, fibre curvature tended to diminish gradually from scoured fibre to top. Blending wool with alpaca fibres improved the cohesion properties of the blended sliver, compared with pure alpaca slivers. For a high ratio of alpaca component in the blend, a high-crimp wool should be used to achieve good sliver cohesion. <br /...|$|R
25|$|The Holden comb was {{suited for}} the combing of short staple <b>wools.</b> The <b>slivers</b> of <b>wool</b> are fed into the machine through the feed guides to the filing head rollers and {{transferred}} to the pins of the comb circle by the lashing action of the filling heads. As the comb circle rotates, the fallers of the square motion rise, their pins piercing the fringe of fibres held in the comb circle by the keeper plate, and by drawing away give the fibres their initial combing. This removes any short fibres or noil and some long fibres termed robbings which are deposited in a box {{at the back of}} the square motion. As the comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off head the fringe is penetrated by the pins of the intersecting or nacteur combs, the drawing-off rollers giving the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the pins of the nacteur comb and the comb circle; the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the coiler mechanism and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils remaining in the nacteur combs are transferred to the comb circle by a small comb and removed with the noil in the comb circle pins by brushes and lifting knives and deposited into a box ready for removal.|$|R
