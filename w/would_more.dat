5|$|Mortier {{accepted}} the bait of a rumored Russian retreat. In {{the early morning}} of 11 November he and Gazan departed from Dürenstein to seize Stein and Krems, presuming the Russians had either abandoned the settlements or left only a small rear-guard behind. As they approached Stein, a column of Miloradovich's troops attacked the French forward positions. Thinking this force was the rumored Russian rear guard, Mortier ordered Gen. Gazan to counterattack and push east towards the town of Stein. Fighting spread though the villages of Oberloiben, Unterloiben and the farm at Rothenhof. Instead of withdrawing, as a rear guard <b>would,</b> <b>more</b> and more Russian troops appeared and engaged the French column.|$|E
5|$|No {{news about}} the game was made {{available}} for 18 months after it was initially announced. Davis thought the game was announced too early, causing excitement for it to die down {{too far from the}} release date. The developers carried out focus tests during this period, and the gameplay was found to be too slow-paced compared to competitors such as Call of Duty. As a result, the team spent time to speed up the game's action so that it <b>would</b> <b>more</b> closely match the narrative.|$|E

30|$|Specialisation {{requires}} {{the division of}} labour. If the division of labour proceeds, society <b>would</b> become <b>more</b> plural than today. Tastes, ideas, and values <b>would</b> become <b>more</b> progressively diversified. A peer-to-peer society <b>would</b> thus be <b>more</b> fragmented than today. However, in such a society people <b>would</b> be <b>more</b> dependent of each other as well. The more communities, companies, and networks specialise, the more they need to exchange products and services. This creates “organic solidarity” that binds the fragmented society together.|$|R
5|$|The first stealth liposomes were passively {{targeted}} at tumor tissues. Because tumors induce rapid and uncontrolled angiogenesis they are especially “leaky” and allow liposomes {{to exit the}} bloodstream {{at a much higher}} rate than normal tissue <b>would.</b> <b>More</b> recently work has been undertaken to graft antibodies or other molecular markers onto the liposome surface in the hope of actively binding them to a specific cell or tissue type. Some examples of this approach are already in clinical trials.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of development, Nihilistic wanted to support editing of the game by the user-community, having seen the {{benefits}} to the community while working on other games. Staff who worked on Jedi Knight knew the experience of creating a new, customized programming language called COG that gave the programmers the results they wanted but cost time and significant project resources. With Redemption, they wanted to incorporate an existing scripting engine that <b>would</b> <b>more</b> easily enable users to further develop the game instead of developing their own code again, which would consume months of development time. The team tested various languages, but became aware of another studio, Rebel Boat Rocker, which was receiving attention for its use of the Java language. Speaking to that studio's lead programmer Billy Zelsnak, Nihilistic decided to experiment with Java, having little prior knowledge of it. The language successfully integrated into the NOD engine without problems, providing a standardized and freely distributable scripting engine. Several designers were trained to use Java {{to allow them to}} build the several hundred scripts required to drive the game's storyline.|$|E
5|$|Due to the city's {{population}} decline, {{beginning in}} the 1920s and accelerating through the 1950s, local government leaders made several attempts to consolidate services. A preGreat Depression annexation attempt by the city failed due to opposition from county voters, and only after World War II <b>would</b> <b>more</b> efforts be made toward consolidation. The first (and one of the few) successful attempts at consolidation resulted {{in the creation of}} the Metropolitan Sewer District, a citycounty water and sewer company formed in 1954. The next year, however, a citycounty mass transit agency was rejected by voters, followed by a failed charter revision in 1955 that would have unified the city and the county. As the County population grew, local subdivisions began multiplying and incorporating into cities and towns, producing more than 90 separate municipalities by the 1960s. Regional planning advocates succeeded in the 1965 creation of the EastWest Gateway Coordinating Council, a group given the power to approve or deny applications for federal aid from cities.|$|E

5|$|In 1870, Sartain met Mary Cassatt in Philadelphia and the {{following}} year they left for Paris, London, Parma, and Turin to study painting. The women spent the first winter in Italy and studied printmaking with Carlo Raimondi, who taught engraving at the Academy of Fine Arts in Parma. Sartain {{spent the rest of}} the four-year stay in Paris and studied under Évariste Vital Luminais. She shared a studio with Jeanne Rongier. Florence Esté, Sartain's friend, also worked in the studio occasionally. The women copied each other's work and provided one another criticism and encouragement. Two of Sartain's paintings, genre painting Le Piece de Conviction (The Reproof) and a portrait of Mlle. Del Sarte, were accepted at the Paris salon in 1875. Sartain returned to the United States that year, when she ran out of money. Harriet (Hattie) Judd Sartain, who was her brother Samuel's wife and a successful homeopathic physician, had lent Emily Sartain money for her education. Emily believed Hattie was likely to continue to help with education expenses in Philadelphia where expenses were lower and she <b>would</b> <b>more</b> likely sell her works.|$|E
5|$|In all Zveno configurations, all {{aircraft}} were piloted and all {{had their}} engines running — {{it was expected}} that the combined thrust <b>would</b> <b>more</b> than offset the weight and actually improve the performance of the mothership compared to conventional bombers. The fighters were rigidly attached via pyramid-shaped metal frames, with both latches controlled by the fighter pilots. (On Zveno-1, the front latches were controlled by the bomber crew, while the back latch was controlled by the pilot; this was changed to all-pilot control in the next version). The original design included umbilical fuel lines which permitted the fighters to use fuel from the bomber while attached, although this was not fully implemented in practice.|$|E
5|$|Tallon's form as Australia's wicket-keeper since World War II saw him {{selected}} for the 1948 Ashes tour {{as part of the}} side that would become known to cricket history as the Invincibles. Tallon was the first-choice wicket-keeper, with Saggers as his deputy. Having spent the majority of his life in sunny Queensland and growing up in tropical Bundaberg, the cold English climate initially caught Tallon off guard. He did not wet his inner gloves as was his custom due to the temperature. As England agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs, this meant that the ball <b>would</b> <b>more</b> frequently be in a favourable state for fast bowling, since it would swing more. As a result, Australia adopted a pace-oriented strategy and Ian Johnson was the only spinner regularly used in the Test matches. Colin McCool was not to play a Test on the tour, depriving Tallon of an opportunity to show his stumping abilities standing up at the stumps to his Queensland team-mate in the Tests.|$|E

5|$|West's {{arguments}} {{have been}} highly influential, but other scholars {{have arrived at}} different conclusions using the same evidence. Fowler thinks that the Sicyon genealogy <b>would</b> <b>more</b> likely reflect a composition before Cleisthenes' death (c.575 BCE) and dates the poem to the period closely following the First Sacred War (595–585 BCE), connecting its content to the growing influence of the Amphictyonic League and placing its author in Aeolian Thessaly because of the Aeolid family-trees centered around that region which dominate the earlier portions of the poem. Hirschberger, on the other hand, takes this focus upon the Aeolids and the Catalogue poet's perceived interest in eastern peoples to be indicative of a poet from Aeolis in Asia Minor; she proposes that the Catalogue was composed there between 630 and 590 BCE, viewing {{the composition of the}} Shield of Heracles and an apparent allusion to the poem by Stesichorus (died c.555 BCE) as providing the ultimate terminus ante quem.|$|E

25|$|During {{the public}} discussions in 2007, an {{interest}} group {{put forward a}} proposal to build a new, much larger bridge {{to the east of}} the existing harbour bridge, and demolish the latter. They argued that the new bridge, which would be about 50% longer than the existing one, could be constructed to provide for dedicated public transport (including light rail, which they claimed would allow a tripling of the total capacity in people then being moved over the existing bridge), as well as for cyclists and pedestrians. Significantly, they argued that the new bridge <b>would</b> <b>more</b> or less pay for itself, by freeing up new residential land occupied by several kilometres of motorway approaches {{in some of the most}} sought-after Auckland locations like Saint Marys Bay. The proponents claimed that the bridge would free up more than 35 hectares and open up 3.3km of shoreline, a prize which <b>would</b> <b>more</b> than make up for the fact that the plans for the Western Reclamation redevelopment would in this case find themselves partly compromised by a major motorway in its area. The proposed bridge would also be cheaper to operate, and unlike a tunnel, would not need emission vents.|$|E
