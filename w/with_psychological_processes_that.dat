40|$|This chapter reviews {{theoretical}} {{accounts of}} the relation between music and emotion and presents a cognitive-motor framework for understanding some of its most powerful effects. We first review selected theories and investigations of emotional responses to music. We next discuss evidence that specific attributes of music are individually associated with distinct emotional interpretations, and may be manipulated by performers and composers to convey complex and dynamic emotional messages. We also describe empirical investigations that attempt to disentangle the contributions of cross-cultural and culture-specific associations between music and emotion. Finally, we introduce a body of theory and data concerning the cognitive-motor implications of music, and argue that important emotional effects can arise because music is optimally tailored to instantiate cognitive-motor processes of synchronization. This conception focuses on the capacity of music to resonate <b>with</b> <b>psychological</b> <b>processes</b> <b>that</b> function in human synchronization, and to elicit emotional effects related to these processes. 19 page(s...|$|E
40|$|When most omnivores and herbivores become sodium {{depleted}} {{they engage}} in the motivated behavior of sodium appetite (AKA salt appetite), or the seeking out and ingestion of salty substances. Sodium appetite is associated <b>with</b> <b>psychological</b> <b>processes</b> <b>that</b> serve to enhance the incentive and rewarding value of salty substances {{in order to attract}} animals to salty substances and reinforce the ingestion of them. The experience of sodium depletion also produces long-lasting changes in behavior; one of the most apparent changes being a seemingly life-long increase in hypertonic salt intake which indicates sodium appetite is sensitized. Two neural circuits have been implicated in the sensitization of sodium appetite: 1) a forebrain neural circuit that regulates body fluid homeostasis, and 2) the mesolimbic dopamine system which mediates motivated behaviors. This dissertation has three aims that serve the overall purpose of providing {{a better understanding of the}} neurobiological mechanisms that mediate the sensitization of sodium appetite. The first aim is to develop a model of sodium depletion that is amenable to pharmacological manipulation in order to determine whether the -blockade of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, which are critical for neural plasticity, will prevent the sensitization of sodium appetite. The second aim is to determine whether sensitization is associated with relatively long-term molecular changes in forebrain areas that regulate body fluid homeostasis. The third aim is to identify how forebrain areas involved in body fluid homeostasis may connect to and influence activity in the mesolimbic dopamine system...|$|E

Beginning with {{an analysis of}} the ways in which Dickens’s tale encourages readers to interrogate the epistemological bases of memory and perception, I track Pepper’s translation of the text into a popular theatrical event designed to exploit the recollective powers of an increasingly visually literate mid-nineteenth-century audience. Dickens’s and Pepper’s shared preoccupation with memory and illusion, as well as <b>with</b> the <b>psychological</b> <b>processes</b> <b>that</b> were thought to induce spectral visions, resulted in a performance that challenged viewers’ notions of agency and consciousness. A seminal chapter in the archaeology of cinema, the creation of “Pepper’s Ghost” brought popular literature into conversation with Victorian discourses as diverse as psychology, the paranormal, optics, and drama. 23 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The Development of Stardom: Celebrity, Image and the Media {{argues that}} the {{phenomenon}} of stardom {{has little to do}} with 'stars' and more to do <b>with</b> <b>psychological</b> <b>processes</b> of 'fans' <b>that</b> create 'artificial' relationships with them. The thesis examines how the fans' bond with a star evolves through a cycle. This can be traced through the foundational stages of 'early attachment', to a period in which the fan feels self actualised by establishing a 'healthy' relationship with the star, and on to a phase where the bond fades. Here, fans either reattach to a new star or react possessively, by trying to hold on to a star despite the continued erosion of their bond. The thesis suggests that the bond the fan forms with the star is false, and yet despite fans often being conscious of their 'fandom', true detachment from a reliance on stars is particularly difficult...|$|R
40|$|Anosognosia for {{hemiplegia}} {{has seen}} a century of almost continuous research, yet a definitive understanding of its mechanism remains elusive. Essentially, anosognosic patients hold quasi-delusional beliefs about their paralysed limbs, {{in spite of all}} the contrary evidence, repeated questioning, and logical argument. We review a range of findings suggesting that emotion and motivation play an important role in anosognosia. We conclude that anosognosia involves (amongst other things) a <b>process</b> of <b>psychological</b> defence. This conclusion stems from a wide variety of clinical and experimental investigations, including data on implicit awareness of deficit, fluctuations in awareness over time, and dramatic effects upon awareness of psychological interventions such as psychotherapy, reframing of the emotional consequences of the paralysis, and first versus third person perspectival manipulations. In addition, we review and refute the (eight) arguments historically raised against the â��defenceâ�� hypothesis, including the claim that a defence-based account cannot explain the lateralised nature of the disorder. We argue that damage to a well-established right-lateralised emotion regulation system, <b>with</b> links to <b>psychological</b> <b>processes</b> <b>that</b> appear to underpin allocentric spatial cognition, plays a key role in anosognosia (at least in some patients). We conclude with a discussion of implications for clinical practice...|$|R

This article focuses on this debate and outlines that behavioral data are limited because (a) they have difficulty distinguishing between interactions between individuals-as-individuals and individuals-as-group members, and (b) when the psychological group is properly understood it becomes clear that much of group research con-cerns individuals-as-group members and the emergence of a shared social identity (along with shifts in self-definition from I to we). The implication is that behavioural data per se are limited in being able to infer the very <b>psychological</b> <b>processes</b> <b>that</b> are central to group research.

40|$|Abstract. A {{synthesis}} {{is presented}} {{of the social}} <b>psychological</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> explains how {{members of the public}} receive, process, and eventually come to take protective actions in response to the receipt of warnings of extreme floods. The case is made that effective public warnings must provide for public interaction and foster the search for information in addition to received warnings. In fact, the communication of climatological, geological and technological hazards, risk, and disaster information and warnings to the public is an almost continual process when viewed globally. For example, {{it has been estimated that}} an evacuation a day occurs on average in the United States alone. Warnings are issued for varied risks, for example, hurricanes, floods, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and transported or stored hazardous materials. Hazards such as these vary in character, but they are similar in that they can result in low-probability/high-consequence disaster events, and because the basic social <b>psychological</b> <b>process</b> <b>that</b> directs public response is similar across hazards. It is the purpose of this paper to synthesize research and knowledge on the <b>process</b> <b>that</b> underlies public response to warnings of disasters. Several specific recommendations for future research are presented. 1. PUBLIC WARNING RESPONSE IS A SOCIAL PROCES...|$|R
