5|$|After {{aftershocks}} {{from the}} quake had concluded, examination took place, producing a focal {{solution to the}} small events. Movement of these shocks <b>was</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of previous earthquakes around the Azores. For these earthquakes, scientists had determined that the conjugate nodal plane was responsible, seeing shearing on the right-lateral (dextral) side. All faulting {{in this area is}} strike-slip-oriented, and on a rather large scale. Because of this research, information now points towards Azores volcanism being controlled by earthquake movement.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{may have}} visited the Yosemite area {{as long as}} 8,000 to 10,000 years ago.

An article in Macworld praised the update and especially the new editing features, but said it had some quirks, such as a difficult-to-find Edit button. Some of the iHome software, which plays video content from a computer onto a television, was released in 2006 as a universal binary.|$|E
5|$|In late 1941, Luftflotte 2 {{supported}} the final German offensive against Moscow, codenamed Operation Typhoon. Raids on Moscow proved hazardous, as Moscow had good all-weather airfields and opposition from both fighters and anti-aircraft guns <b>was</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> encountered over Britain. The bad weather that hampered ground operations from October on impeded air operations even more. Nonetheless, Luftflotte 2 continued to fly critical reconnaissance, interdiction, {{close air support}} and air supply missions.|$|E
5|$|In {{regard to}} the city, the emancipated slave was far from equal to a citizen by birth. He was liable to all types of obligations, as one {{can see from the}} {{proposals}} of Plato in The Laws: presentation three times monthly at the home of the former master, forbidden to become richer than him, etc. In fact, the status of emancipated slaves <b>was</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of metics, the residing foreigners, who were free but did not enjoy a citizen's rights.|$|E

5|$|The Bearer of the Mace (Zhi jinwu 執金吾) {{was also}} known as the Bearer of the Gilded Mace. This official, whose title had been Commandant of the Capital (Zhongwei 中尉) before 104 BC, {{maintained}} law and order in the capital city—excluding the imperial palaces—in both Western Han Chang'an and Eastern Han Luoyang. During Western Han, his salary-rank was Fully 2,000-dan, thus his prestige <b>was</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of the Nine Ministers. However, during Eastern Han his salary-rank was reduced from Fully 2,000-dan to Equivalent to 2,000-dan.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Brad Follmer {{was created in}} season nine to provide a love interest for Reyes, as the writers believed the audience needed {{to know more about}} her. However, Follmer's unresolved relationship with Reyes also served to heighten the conflict between Doggett and Follmer, as both men had feelings for her. Portraying actress Annabeth Gish was pleased that the relationship between her character and Scully <b>was</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of two sisters, rather than Reyes serving as an antagonist to Scully.|$|E

Amr intended for Fustat to serve as a base from which to conquer North Africa, as well as to launch further campaigns against Byzantium. It remained the primary base for Arab expansion in Africa until Qayrawan was founded in Tunisia in 670.|$|E
5|$|The {{researchers}} were continually met by clouds of sulfide and sulfate. The sudden collapse of Pele's Vents caused a large discharge of hydrothermal material. The presence of certain indicator minerals in the mixture suggested temperatures exceeded 250°C, {{a record for}} an underwater volcano. The composition of the materials <b>was</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of black smokers, the hydrothermal vent plumes located along mid-ocean ridges. Samples from mounds built by discharges from the hydrothermal plumes resembled white smokers.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} known about the {{behaviour}} of Newton's parakeet, but it is probable that it <b>was</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of other members of its genus. Leguat mentioned that the parrots of the island ate the nuts of the bois d'olive tree (Cassine orientalis). Tafforet also stated that the parrots ate the seeds of the bois de buis shrub (Fernelia buxifolia), which is endangered today, but was common all over Rodrigues and nearby islets during his visit. Newton's parakeet may have fed on leaves as the related echo parakeet does. The fact that it survived long after Rodrigues had been heavily deforested shows that its ecology was less vulnerable than that of, for example, the Rodrigues parrot.|$|E

Tyldesley's 13,621 households included 24.0% one-person, 46.1% married couples living together, 10.2% were co-habiting couples, and 9.0% single parents with their children. Of those aged 16–74, 27.0% had no academic qualifications, lower than 28.9% in all of England and much lower than the 35.3% for the Wigan borough.|$|E
5|$|At the 2001 UK census, {{the urban}} area of Poulton-le-Fylde had a {{population}} of 18,264. The 2001 population density for Wyre was 3.74per hectare, with a 100 to 90.7 female-to-male ratio. The proportion of residents who classified themselves as White was 98.9%, a figure {{higher than the average}} for the North West (94.4%) and England (90.9%). Those classifying themselves as belonging to ethnic minorities were correspondingly lower than the regional and national averages.

5|$|Daily life at Fort Greble <b>was</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> {{experienced}} by soldiers at other forts in the Washington defenses. A soldier's normal day began with reville before sunrise {{and was immediately}} followed by morning muster, at which the soldiers of the garrison were counted and reported for sick call. Following muster, the day was filled with work on improving the fort's defenses and drill of various types, usually consisting of gunnery practice, but also including infantry and parade drill. This schedule usually continued, broken by meal and rest breaks, until taps was called at 8:00 or 9:00p.m. Sunday was {{a break in the}} routine as the muster was immediately followed by a weekly inspection and church call. Sunday afternoons were a soldier's free time, and this was usually filled by writing letters home, bathing, or simply catching up on extra sleep.|$|E

5|$|Högdahl {{serving as}} the company's head and tech lead, was {{responsible}} for creating a new game engine for future games, and looking for publishers willing to help publish its games. At that time, the company had only about five employees, and had created a prototype for a video game and pitched it to publishers at E3 1998. Gremlin Interactive agreed to publish the game, and the deal was finalized in late 1998. The company grew to have roughly eleven staff members. The game was a first-person action role-playing game named Sorcery. With a high fantasy setting, the game featured 3D visuals and its gameplay <b>was</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of Diablo and Quake. However, Gremlin Interactive was acquired by Infogrames in 2000 and the partnership with Starbreeze dissolved, resulting in the game's cancellation.|$|E
5|$|Iftah Ya Simsim was {{the first}} children's {{educational}} TV program {{of its kind in}} the Arab world and the first Sesame Street co-production in the region.

The GCC considered creating a co-production for many years, so consultations were held among its member countries regarding how to do so. Many of the early co-productions were simple, dubbed versions with local language voice-overs and instructional cutaways, but the GCC wanted to create their own original version.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, 14.6per cent of Altrincham's {{population}} was middle class, {{slightly higher than}} the figure for England and Wales, which was 14per cent.
