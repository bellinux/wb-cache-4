Local people claimed the victims included boys as young as 12 but Pakistani officials insisted they had been shown satellite images of people training and had checked the identity cards of all those killed, and that all were adults.|$|E
25|$|We {{were in the}} {{universe}} of the teenage movie. Teenage reality. So <b>we</b> <b>said</b> here’s what’s going to be weird about the world of our movie: No one’s {{going to be over}} 30. The world is a high school, essentially. And Tom Cody will be the football hero. And Willem Dafoe is the greaser. Remember: You had John Hughes at the time, and then you had Coppola making two high school movies: The Outsiders and Rumble Fish. So Walter said we’re going to make a high school movie that’s also going to be a comic book and also going to be a musical.|$|E
25|$|But if we admit, goddesses, then, in {{addition}} to Nerthus, Ostara has the strongest claim to consideration. To what <b>we</b> <b>said</b> on p. 290 I can add some significant facts. The heathen Easter had {{much in common with}} May-feast and the reception of spring, particularly in matter of bonfires. Then, through long ages there seem to have lingered among the people Easter-games so-called, which the church itself had to tolerate : I allude especially to the custom of Easter eggs, and to the Easter tale which preachers told from the pulpit for the people's amusement, connecting it with Christian reminiscences.|$|E

25|$|<b>We</b> <b>said</b> {{this movie}} is a stylized movie, it’s not so {{different}} from the world of a musical. And there were a few other things that contributed to that direction. One was the decision on Universal’s part, a crazy decision, to shoot the movie almost entirely in the studio under a tarpaulin. They built this gigantic tarpaulin, and the Battery and all these other places were built as real places. The Richlands. And just so you know, this is the early ’80s and you had stylized films—like New York, New York—that were all done on set and that idea was in the air. That idea of a totally artificial universe. The point is that we had in mind one sentence inspired by George Lucas: “in a galaxy long ago,” a futuristic past. That was in our heads…there’s the past and there’s the future, sort of.|$|E
