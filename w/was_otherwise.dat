5|$|As Sinthgunt <b>is</b> <b>otherwise</b> unattested, her {{significance}} <b>is</b> <b>otherwise</b> unknown, {{but some}} scholarly theories exist about {{her role in}} Germanic mythology based on proposed etymologies, and the potential significance of her placement within the incantation.|$|R

5|$|Sport {{has been}} both {{one of the most}} unifying {{cultural}} forces in Northern England and, thanks to local rivalries such as the Lancashire–Yorkshire Roses rivalry, one of the most divisive. As huge numbers of people moved into recently-built cities with little cultural heritage, local sports teams offered the population a sense of place and identity that <b>was</b> <b>otherwise</b> absent.|$|E
5|$|The first Super Cub {{variation}} was the C102, {{launched in}} April 1960. The C102 had electric start {{in addition to}} kick starting, and battery & coil ignition instead of magneto, but <b>was</b> <b>otherwise</b> {{the same as the}} C100.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} mixed reviews; some reviewers {{praised the}} title for providing a humorous sandbox interface to experiment with, while others criticized the game's reliance {{on social media}} to popularize what <b>was</b> <b>otherwise</b> a simple and buggy product.|$|E

5|$|The party's {{economic}} policies did not deviate substantially from the generally supported mixed {{economy of the}} Netherlands. Its other demands {{did not have a}} strong ideological coherency. Supporting a generous welfare state for the Dutch people, it <b>was</b> <b>otherwise</b> sceptical of state interventionism in the economy; notably by high taxes which would hinder private initiative, or overspending on subsidies.|$|E
5|$|Adams did {{not speak}} French, the {{international}} language of diplomacy at the time. He therefore assumed a less visible role, but emerged as the commission's chief administrator, imposing order and methods lacking in his delegation's finances and record-keeping affairs. His first stay in Europe, between April 1, 1778, and June 17, 1779, <b>was</b> <b>otherwise</b> unremarkable, and {{he returned to his}} home in Braintree in early August 1779. Back home, Adams became one of the founders and charter members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the main}} focus of Australia's {{military}} during World War I was overseas in Europe and the Middle East, there was still a necessity to maintain troops in Australia on home service to carry out a number of essential tasks. As the AIF <b>was</b> <b>otherwise</b> engaged these duties out of necessity fell to the soldiers of the militia and a small number of regular soldiers.|$|E

5|$|At Battle of Novi, his {{division}} {{was part of}} Laurent Saint-Cyr's right wing. At the battle itself, his troops {{were the only ones}} properly positioned; the rest of the French army <b>was</b> <b>otherwise</b> out of place and unready for battle. He and Saint-Cyr held the center of the French line, beating off two Russian assaults. After the French defeat at Novi, he went with Saint-Cyr to Savona, where he participated in operations around Genoa. Eventually, he rejoined Moreau to campaign in southwestern Germany, culminating in the Battle of Hohenlinden.|$|E
5|$|Calabria was {{designed}} for use in Italy's colonial empire, rather than the earlier vessels intended as fleet scouts. As such, her steel hull was sheathed with wood and then a layer of zinc {{to protect it from}} fouling during lengthy tours in the overseas colonies. Additionally, she was equipped with less powerful though more efficient engines than the earlier cruisers. The ship <b>was</b> <b>otherwise</b> similar to preceding designs like the Regioni class, having a displacement only slightly lower and a nearly identical gun battery.|$|E
5|$|The deity {{depicted}} on page 9 of the Grolier Codex {{is believed to}} be the Mountain God with split head. This image <b>was</b> <b>otherwise</b> unknown in the 1960s. Other examples of it were later discovered at the Maya sites of Tancah and Pasión del Cristo. Coe and his colleagues argue that it is very unlikely that a forger would have known about this deity before it was described elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|These events {{led to a}} {{conflict}} with Ivan Sratsimir, who was in turn given the rule of Vidin, probably as a compensation. Another indirect piece of evidence for the feud {{is the fact that}} Ivan Sratsimir's portrait not included in the Tetraevangelia of Ivan Alexander, where the whole family of the emperor <b>was</b> <b>otherwise</b> presented. In 1356 Ivan Sratsimir proclaimed himself emperor of Vidin. Together with his father and younger brother Ivan Asen V, Ivan Shishman presided over the church synods at Tarnovo in the late 1360s.|$|E
5|$|Tyler's {{governorship}} <b>was</b> <b>otherwise</b> uneventful. He promoted states' {{rights and}} adamantly opposed any concentration of federal power. In order to thwart federal infrastructure proposals, he suggested Virginia actively expand its own road system. A proposal {{was made to}} expand the state's poorly funded public school system, but no significant action was taken. Tyler was re-elected unanimously to a second one-year term in December 1826.|$|E
5|$|Willaumez's {{squadron}} {{remained at}} {{large in the}} Atlantic until July 1806, when a hurricane scattered the vessels along the American Seaboard where British patrols were waiting to intercept them. Of the 11 ships that set out in December 1805, just four eventually returned to France. The crews of the British squadron were decorated for their success, {{with the exception of}} Duckworth, who shared in the general thanks but <b>was</b> <b>otherwise</b> unrewarded. By leaving his post off Cadiz he had provoked the anger of Vice-Admiral Lord Collingwood, commander in the Mediterranean; only his victory enabled Duckworth to escape a court martial.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} {{wave off}} the Bahamas organized into Tropical Depression Six {{on the afternoon}} of July 21. The depression became the sixth named storm of the season only two hours later, the first time the sixth storm of the season had ever formed that early in the season. The storm headed northward from the Bahamas, then northeast over the Atlantic, becoming disorganized by July 24 under the effects of shear and drier air. It moved erratically, inching closer to Bermuda while barely remaining a tropical storm. Bermuda received some strong wind gusts, but <b>was</b> <b>otherwise</b> unaffected. Tropical Storm Franklin then accelerated north and northeast, roughly paralleling the East Coast of the United States, and intensified to near hurricane strength. Eventually, Franklin became extratropical along the coast of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, {{there was}} {{considerable}} debate over the future of the pipelines. The major oil companies, such as Standard Oil, campaigned for the conversion of the pipelines for the transfer of natural gas. Demand for natural gas was rising rapidly, and it was produced in large quantities in the Texas oilfields, but could not be got to market in the north-east and <b>was</b> <b>otherwise</b> burnt off uselessly into the atmosphere. The railroad and coal companies, who saw this as likely to introduce additional competition for coal and coal gas, and therefore lower demand for their goods and services, argued against this move. The smaller oil companies proposed continuing to use the pipelines for oil in order to undermine the transport monopolies of the larger corporations.|$|E
5|$|HMS Zealous {{was given}} a {{straight}} stem and a rounded stern, but her hull <b>was</b> <b>otherwise</b> unmodified from her original form; it had been found that lengthening the hull, as {{was done in the}} earlier , led to longitudinal weakness. Her conversion to a central battery ironclad therefore cost less than that of any of her contemporaries, though this was offset with a shorter battery and therefore a less effective broadside. She also carried less armour than the earlier class, and was nearly a knot slower; however, as she was built to serve in distant waters, and not expected to face opposing ships of significant force, these shortcomings were thought acceptable.|$|E
