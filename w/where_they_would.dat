5|$|Emigrants {{departed}} from an English port (generally Liverpool) and travelled by ship to New York or Boston, then by railroad to Iowa City, Iowa, the western terminus {{of the rail}} line, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be outfitted with handcarts and other supplies.|$|E

Such ditches would {{make it difficult to}} bring siege equipment (ladders, rams, and other engines) to the walls.

5|$|Following the French {{surrender}} on 22 June, the French fleet {{was to be}} disarmed under German and Italian supervision, {{under the}} terms of the Armistice. The British high command, however, was concerned that the French ships would be seized by the Axis powers and placed in service. The Axis navies would then outnumber the British Royal Navy. Prime Minister Winston Churchill therefore ordered Vice Admiral James Somerville, the commander of Force H, to neutralize the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir. He was instructed to order the French vessels to join the British with the Free French, to move them to French possessions like Martinique <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be outside the reach of the Axis powers, to move them to the USA <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be interned, to scuttle themselves, or be sunk. On 3 July, Somerville arrived and delivered the ultimatum. After 10 hours of discussions and the French rejection of any part of the ultimatum, the British ships opened fire.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} two years, he led his legions across the Rhine against the Germans, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> confront the forces of Arminius and his allies. Tacitus says the purpose of those campaigns were to avenge the defeat of Varus at the Battle of Teutoburg Forest, and not to expand Roman territory.|$|E

50|$|During {{his student}} days, Lukits shared a studio with the Swedish-born painter Christian von Schneidau (1893-1976). The two became friends in Chicago and would later renew their {{friendship}} in California <b>where</b> <b>they</b> both <b>would</b> paint portraits of movie stars.|$|R
5|$|He also {{promoted}} {{the creation of}} schools for women, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> learn about weaving, as well as reading. However, he did not aim to generate intellectual women, but just to prevent ignorance and laziness, and have them learn things valuable for daily living. Being a strong Catholic himself, he was aligned with the Catholic perspective that rejected mixed-sex education, in contrast with Protestantism.|$|E
5|$|It {{could be}} {{possible}} to build a surface base that would produce fuel for further exploration of the Solar System. In 1997, the Artemis Project designed a plan to colonize Europa. According to this plan, explorers would drill down into the Europan ice crust, entering the postulated subsurface ocean, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> inhabit artificial air pockets.|$|E
5|$|The 722 Sunshields were {{carefully}} pre-positioned in the Martello tank-holding area near El Imayid railway station. Each was numbered.

5|$|The {{divisions}} of I ANZAC Corps, now commanded by Lieutenant General William Birdwood with Godley taking over II ANZAC Corps, were initially {{based in the}} Armentières sector <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> undergo intensive training in trench warfare on the Western Front. The Armentières front line was regarded by the Allies as a nursery sector where new units could undergo familiarisation without being called upon for intensive offensive operations.|$|E
5|$|The {{facility}} was designed, as was its predecessor at Watten, to receive, process and launch V-2 rockets {{at a high}} rate. Trains carrying V-2s would enter {{the heart of the}} complex through the Ida rail tunnel, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be unloaded. A large number of V-2s could be stored in the side tunnels; LOX would also be produced on-site ready for use. When the time came, the rockets would be moved into the octagonal preparation chamber <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be lifted to a vertical position for fuelling and arming. From there they would be transported on motorised launch carriages, still in a vertical position, through the Gustav and Gretchen passageways. The launch pads were located {{at the end of the}} track on the floor of the quarry, from where the missiles would be fired.|$|E
5|$|Through July {{and early}} August, Montgomery and Schuyler {{continued}} to organize their force, raising {{the men and}} materials needed for an invasion. While they organized, Washington decided to expand the invasion, ordering Benedict Arnold to lead another invasion force that would invade Quebec from Maine. It was to join with Schuyler's army outside Quebec City, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> launch a joint attack on to the city.|$|E

Life Magazine wrote up a complete story with pictures on this unusual event of the past history of the House of Flavors when it was known as Park Dairy.

5|$|A {{scheme to}} {{circumvent}} the settler grants altogether soon emerged. A railroad official hired a surveyor and logger named Stephen A. Douglas Puter to round up people from Portland saloons, and then {{take them to the}} land office <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> register for an O parcel as a settler, and then promptly resell to the railroad for bundling with other plots and resale to the highest bidder, typically as much as $40 an acre. In 1904, an investigation by The Oregonian uncovered the scandal, by which time it had grown to such a magnitude that the paper reported that more than 75% of the land sales had violated federal law.|$|E
5|$|According to O'Brien, only he, Woodfull, the masseur (who was deaf), Alan Kippax, {{and former}} Australian Test players Jack Ryder and Ernie Jones were present when the {{incident}} took place, {{but most of}} the Australian team were watching the match from a balcony adjoining the dressing room from <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have been able to hear the confrontation.

50|$|The {{argument}} {{for an independent}} republic is that Siberia makes up 77% of Russian territory (13.1 million square kilometers) and includes 40 million people.

5|$|After each flight {{the engines}} would {{be removed from}} the orbiter and {{transferred}} to the Space Shuttle Main Engine Processing Facility (SSMEPF), <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be inspected and refurbished in preparation for reuse on a subsequent flight.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, {{the boys}} would play sports, boxing, or other leisure activities, or have hockey or rugby league {{training}} if the weather was suitable. Weekends revolved mainly around sports. Field hockey, rugby league, and other sports were commonly played during the winter time. The boys of the orphanage had a well-known reputation in Goulburn for their sports abilities; boys who participated in tournaments and games usually did well, winning many trophies. The orphanage also had a football team. Sometimes, the boys would hold fetes or participate in annual concerts and operettas, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> sing and dance.|$|E
50|$|The march {{began on}} October 4, 1957, with Jayawardene and Dudley Senanayake {{and the head}} of the procession. At Grandpass {{junction}} in Colombo, the march was pelted with stones by supporters of the SLFP. Opposition to the march intensified further as it passed Kelaniya, and S. D. Bandaranaike, nephew of Prime Minister Bandaranaike, squatted in the middle of the road with his supporters to stop the march at Imbulgoda, in Gampaha. As a result, the UNP was forced to give up the march, and they proceeded to Kandy by vehicle, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> declared <b>they</b> <b>would</b> oppose the setting up of regional councils.|$|R
60|$|The Greeks in the defile {{perceived}} at {{once that}} they were now wholly {{at the mercy of}} their enemies.
