25|$|House lights provide {{light on}} the theater's seats and aisles for the {{audience}} before and after performances and during intermissions. They are generally incandescent lights, however fluorescent lights or scoops {{may be used in}} some instances. House lights are often controlled by dimmers, but are sometimes on simple switches. Worklights provide general lighting backstage or in the house, and are often fluorescent fixtures. <b>Work</b> <b>lights</b> are almost always non-dimmed.|$|E
25|$|Scoop {{lights or}} scoops are {{circular}} fixtures {{that do not}} have any lenses. They have an ellipsoidal reflector {{at the back of the}} fixture that directs the light out of the fixture. Since they do not have any sort of lens system they are cheaper than other fixtures. However, the light cannot be focused at all (even PARs allow more control than scoops). Scoops are most often used to flood the stage with light from above, or to light backdrops. Scoops can have gels affixed. Occasionally they are used as <b>work</b> <b>lights</b> (see below).|$|E

25|$|After this, their Japanese {{distributor}} approached {{them for}} a two-week run in Japan. Admittedly reluctant at first {{to return to the}} stage after the underwhelming response to the Mole Show, the Residents created the 13th Anniversary tour. While the musical performance was more mainstream, the stage show was another over-the-top spectacle, featuring inflatable giraffes, dancers in eyeball masks illuminating the darkened stage with <b>work</b> <b>lights,</b> and a lead vocalist who seemed to change costumes throughout the show from wearing his eyeball mask to wearing a Richard Nixon mask, and at one point wearing only a wig and fake ears. After the two-week run in Japan, the Residents took the show through the US. During the US leg of the tour the band encountered a few problems, including having the tour manager having to fan a member's keyboard because of overheating, being booked in a pool hall and having someone run on stage only to be thrown back into the audience.|$|E
25|$|Most {{theatrical}} lamps are tungsten-halogen (or quartz-halogen), {{an improvement}} {{on the original}} incandescent design that used halogen gas instead of an inert gas. Fluorescent lights are rarely used other than as <b>work</b> <b>lights</b> (see below). Although they are far more efficient, they cannot be dimmed (run at less than full power) without using specialized dimmers, cannot dim to very low levels, do not produce light from a single point or easily concentrated area, and have a warm-up period during which they emit no light or do so intermittently. High-intensity discharge lamps (or HID lamps) are now common where a very bright light output is required, for example in large follow spots, HMI (hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide) floods, and modern automated fixtures. Because these types of lamps cannot be electrically dimmed, dimming is done by mechanical dousers or shutters that physically block portions of the lamp to decrease output. Some specially-designed fittings now use light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as a light source. LEDs are ideal where an intense but unfocused light source is required, such as for lighting a cyclorama.|$|E

50|$|In 1999, UUTV's great grandparent, <b>Light</b> <b>Works</b> Community Darkrooms, re-entered UUTV's {{life in a}} most {{unexpected}} manner.

Unfortunately, <b>Light</b> <b>Works</b> was physically located directly next to the UUTV studios in the Watston Theater complex. <b>Light</b> <b>Works</b> was hungry to acquire the UUTV real estate for their upcoming expansion, and their newfound grant money provided the political and monetary support that they needed.

Consequently, the original Watson Theater television studio was completely gutted {{to make room for}} the <b>Light</b> <b>Works</b> expansion. The UUTV studios and offices were moved down the hall and squeezed into a space that formerly housed the original UUTV offices and the independent student radio station, WJPZ.
