5|$|Saville {{became a}} flying cadet with the Army Air Service in March 1926, {{and entered the}} primary flying school at Brooks Field, Texas. During this time his service branch {{reformed}} as the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC). In September of that year he {{was transferred to the}} advanced flying school at Kelly Field, Texas, from which he graduated on February 28, 1927, gaining a commission as second lieutenant in the Air Reserve. He was assigned to the Fifth Observation Squadron at Mitchel Field, New York and in June 1927, he was appointed a second lieutenant in the Air Corps of the Regular Army. At Mitchel, Saville served ably as adjutant to Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Foulois, but Foulois was unhappy with Saville's absence during weekend train trips to Connecticut to see Ina Isola Hards, his girlfriend. Hards was an honors graduate of Wellesley College where she had performed in theatre plays and had served as class officer. Foulois' wife successfully addressed the problem by inviting Miss Hards to stay at the Foulois home on weekends. Saville married Hards in the Church of Transfiguration in New York City in September 1928; her father, Ira A. Hards, producer of the Mae West Broadway play Diamond Lil, <b>walked</b> <b>her</b> down the aisle. As a wedding present, Foulois granted Saville's request for a transfer back to Crissy Field.|$|E

500|$|One source {{used here}} (Hacking) names the {{daughter}} with Hays on the Titanic as [...] "Margaret", [...] however, it was daughter Orian who was traveling with her husband, [...] Thorton Davidson. [...] That source {{does not mention}} Orian as a passenger on the ship. [...] There was a 24-year-old woman, named Margaret Bechstein Hays on the Titanic, but she was staying in a different compartment than the C.M. Hays party, with another group of people. [...] She escaped via lifeboat No. 7 (with her Pomeranian, Lady), while the other Hays women boarded lifeboat No. 3. [...] Early newspaper reports said that Clara and Margaret Hays, and Mrs. Thornton [...] Davidson disembarked the rescue ship in New York City together and boarded a train for Montreal, [...] while other sources say that Margaret Hays lived in New York {{and took care of}} two young child survivors (Edmond and Michael Navratil), who were unclaimed immediately following the disaster.

2500|$|On a {{small number}} of {{occasions}} Muslim women who wore distinctive hijab were harassed, causing some Muslim women to stay at home, while others temporarily abandoned the practice.

Lucy was initially reticent to fully accept Grant's advances, seeing herself as just a temporary replacement for Emily, but after he regularly <b>walked</b> <b>her</b> home from church services for several weeks without being invited into the Stringham home, she gave up and invited him in.

2500|$|According to Montefiore, [...] "The {{darkness}} {{began to}} descend upon Yezhov's family where his silly, sensual wife was unwittingly {{to play the}} terrible role of black widow spider: most of her lovers were to die. She herself was too sensitive a flower for Yezhov's world. Both she and Yezhov were promiscuous but by then {{they lived in a}} world of high tension, dizzy power over life and death, and dynamic turmoil as men rose and fell around them. If there was justice in Yezhov's fall, it was a tragedy for Yevgenia and little Natasha, to whom he was a kind father. A pall fell on Yevgenia's literary salon. When a friend <b>walked</b> <b>her</b> home to the Kremlin after a party, she herself reflected that Babel was in danger because he had been friends with arrested Trotskyite generals: 'Only his European fame could save him.'
