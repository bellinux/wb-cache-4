5000|$|<b>Weddings</b> <b>are</b> {{often an}} {{occasion}} for particular concern about etiquette; and for some people, <b>weddings</b> <b>are</b> the only time when etiquette becomes a concern. In general, etiquette writers state that a <b>wedding</b> should <b>be</b> one more occasion for the exercise of thoughtfulness towards others, and thus a <b>wedding</b> <b>is</b> not, as is often said, [...] "my special day" [...] (a term [...] "which seems to sanction selfishness"), [...] "her day," [...] or [...] "their day," [...] but an event to be enjoyed by all invited to be present.|$|R

Shepherds read the mantras (the responsibility of the Brahmin in a normal wedding) and the bleating of sheep replaces the traditional wedding band. The <b>wedding</b> <b>is</b> sometimes described as a gandharva marriage. Due to the unceremonious nature of the <b>wedding,</b> she <b>is</b> sometimes considered as a rakh (concubine) of Khandoba.|$|R

5|$|The {{marriage}} ceremony was conducted {{according to the}} Catholic rite between 19 May, when Catherine arrived in Milodraž near Fojnica accompanied by her father, and 22 May 1446. The <b>wedding</b> <b>was</b> attended by a delegation from the Republic of Ragusa (Dubrovnik), but it failed to end all internal strife, since leading noblemen such as Ivaniš Pavlović (Catherine's first cousin, lord of eastern Bosnia) and Petar Vojsalić (lord of Donji Kraji) snubbed it. The coronation, planned {{to take place in}} Mile near Visoko immediately after the <b>wedding,</b> <b>was</b> apparently postponed. The new queen consort converted to Catholicism ("laid aside Patarin errors"), likely prior to her marriage, and was allowed by Pope Eugene to choose for herself two chaplains from among Bosnian Franciscans. The Queen's father appears to have contemplated converting too, but eventually gave up the idea and remained an adherent of the Bosnian Church until his death.|$|E
