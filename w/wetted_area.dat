25|$|Throughout the 1920s and 1930s {{there were}} tighter {{restrictions}} on road steam haulage, including speed, smoke and vapour limits and a 'wetted tax', where the tax due was {{proportional to the}} size of the <b>wetted</b> <b>area</b> of the boiler; this made steam engines less competitive against domestically produced internal combustion engined units (although imports were subject to taxes of up to 33%). As a result of the Salter Report on road funding, an 'axle weight tax' was introduced in 1933 in order to charge commercial motor vehicles more for the costs of maintaining the road system and to do away with the perception that the free use of roads was subsidising the competitors of rail freight. The tax was payable by all road hauliers in proportion to the axle load and was particularly restrictive on steam propulsion, which was heavier than its petrol equivalent.|$|E

40|$|A {{regression}} model {{to predict the}} maintainability of <b>wet</b> <b>areas</b> was developed. The model was derived from comprehensive condition surveys, interviews with professionals and defect analysis of 96 buildings. The study showed that plumbing selection, access for fitting maintenance, material maintainability, usage and construction quality are the most significant parameters associated with the maintainability of <b>wet</b> <b>areas.</b> Maintainability, <b>wet</b> <b>area,</b> multiple regression analysis, maintenance prediction model,...|$|R

50|$|In aeronautics, the <b>wetted</b> <b>area</b> is {{the area}} which is {{in contact with the}} {{external}} airflow. This has a direct relationship on the overall aerodynamic drag of the aircraft. See also Wetted aspect ratio.|$|E
50|$|Multihulls are {{substantially}} faster than monohulls of comparable size, {{in part because}} of their reduced weight, reduced draft and reduced waterline profile. However, their relatively greater total <b>wetted</b> <b>area</b> increases frictional resistance and total resistance at low speeds.|$|E
50|$|The {{addition}} of a bulb to a ship's hull increases its overall <b>wetted</b> <b>area.</b> As <b>wetted</b> <b>area</b> increases, so does drag. At greater speeds and in larger vessels it is the bow wave that is the greatest force impeding the vessel's forward motion through the water. For a vessel that is small or spends {{a great deal of}} its time at a slow speed, the increase in drag will not be offset by the benefit in damping bow wave generation. As the wave counter effects are only significant at the vessel's higher range of speed, bulbous bows are not energy efficient when the vessel cruises outside of these ranges, specifically at lower speeds.|$|E

50|$|Multihull sailboats {{can also}} employ {{hydrofoils}} only to assist performance. Just as daggerboards and rudders are foils that enhance {{the control of}} a boat, assisting hydrofoils provide lift to the hull to reduce the <b>wetted</b> <b>area</b> without actually lifting the boat {{completely out of the}} water.|$|E
5000|$|Blended body or blended wing-body: {{a smooth}} {{transition}} occurs between wing and fuselage, with no hard dividing line. Reduces <b>wetted</b> <b>area</b> and can also reduce interference between airflow over the wing root and any adjacent body, in both cases reducing drag. The Lockheed SR-71 spyplane exemplifies this approach.|$|E

50|$|A sailing {{hydrofoil}}, hydrofoil sailboat, or hydrosail is {{a sailboat}} with wing-like foils mounted under the hull. As the craft increases its speed the hydrofoils lift the hull {{up and out}} of the water, greatly reducing <b>wetted</b> <b>area,</b> resulting in decreased drag and increased speed. A sailing hydrofoil can achieve speeds exceeding twice the wind speed.|$|E
50|$|The BWB form minimises {{the total}} <b>wetted</b> <b>area</b> - {{the surface area}} of the {{aircraft}} skin, thus reducing skin drag to a minimum. It also creates a thickening of the wing root area, allowing a more efficient structure and reduced weight compared to a conventional craft. NASA also plans to integrate Ultra High Bypass (UHB) ratio jet engines with the hybrid wing body.|$|E

50|$|Although it {{may seem}} that the V-tail {{configuration}} {{can result in a}} significant reduction of the tail <b>wetted</b> <b>area,</b> it suffers from an increase in control-actuation complexity, as well as complex and detrimental aerodynamic interaction between the two surfaces. This often results in an upsizing in the total area that reduces or negates the original benefit. The Beechcraft Bonanza light aircraft was originally designed with a V-tail.|$|E

50|$|Hull shapes on sportboat's are {{typically}} {{designed so that}} the hulls plane at high speeds. These hull designs are characterized by fairly sharp bows {{to allow them to}} penetrate waves with reduced drag and a flatter underbody aft of the bow. The flat underbody develops lift as speeds increase and the hull rises higher in the water, which reduces the <b>wetted</b> <b>area</b> and decreases drag, allowing higher speeds to be achieved.|$|E
