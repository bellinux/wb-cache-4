25|$|After killing Tippit, Oswald {{was seen}} {{traveling}} on foot toward the Texas Theater on West Jefferson Blvd. About 1:35p.m. Johnny Calvin Brewer, {{who worked as}} a manager at Hardy's Shoe Store in the same block as the Texas Theater on Jefferson Blvd. saw Oswald turning his face away from the street and duck into the entranceway of the shoe store as Dallas squad cars drove up the street with sirens on. When Oswald left the store, Brewer followed Oswald and <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> <b>go</b> into the Texas Theater movie house without paying while ticket attendant Julie Postal was distracted. Brewer notified Postal, who in turn informed the Dallas Police at 1:40p.m.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was intense}} {{anticipation}} for the match against the Prime Minister's XI as the 54-year-old Sir Donald Bradman agreed to captain the team after 14 years without playing cricket. The thorough {{man that he}} was Bradman started practicing for the big day and 10,000 men, women and children came to see him bat for the last time. His old foe the MCC assistant-manager Alec Bedser agreed to play and the Bradman Pavilion was unveiled at the Manuka Oval. The Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies was a keen cricket fan who initiated these matches in 1951 and the money raised was donated to Legacy, a charity for the dependents of deceased Australian servicemen. Ted Dexter won the toss and elected to bat with Bradman fielding at first slip they rattled the fence with 36 fours and birthday-boy Fred Trueman hit a six. David Sheppard top-scored with 72 and Colin Cowdrey made 42. Richie Benaud took 2/62 off 8 overs, but the bowling honours went to the Canberra leg-spinner G. Brown, who took 3/61. Dexter nicked a ball off Brown to Wally Grout, but was called back by Bradman when he walked as the umpire gave him not out. [...] "Lord Ted" [...] lofted the next ball to Cowper at extra-cover and walked off for 22. Dexter declared the innings at 253/7, leaving the Prime Minister's XI 254 to win and Bob Cowper (47) and Ray Flockton (45) got the home team {{off to a good}} start with 7 boundaries apiece. They had both departed and the score was 108/3 when the name of Bradman came up on the board and the great man in a baggy green cap walked out to the crease to a standing ovation, surrounded by photographers and greeted by the England team. Tom Graveney's leg-spin got him off the mark with a straight-drive and in the next over from Brian Statham the Australian politician Don Chipp hit a single to put Bradman on strike. Although it was the intention of the MCC to let Bradman get some runs, and to bat against Bedser, Statham bowled a leg-cutter which came off the inside edge, brushed the pads and bounced onto the stumps with just enough force to dislodge a bail and the Don was out. Statham threw up his hands in anguish and the crowd was stunned, but [...] "the little man, after on brief look back at his broken wicket, walked quickly away, the step firm, the head erect, but the shoulders, one thought, now slightly stooped. He had made one scoring stroke, for four. The crowd <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> <b>go</b> and signed. How much they wanted just a half-hour, at least, of him - as the Englishmen had." [...] Ironically, in his last Test 14 years before he had been bowled by Eric Hollies for a duck, four runs short of a Test average of 100.00. He reached the pavilion to the commiserations of the Prime Minister and the Duke of Norfolk and told them [...] "It wouldn't happen in a thousand years. Anyway that's my final appearance at the wicket". After this the rest of the match was an anticlimax. Neil Harvey was out for 3 and the PM's XI were 123/6 before Richie Benaud (63) and Ken Mackay (49) restored the situation, but David Allen (5/68) took three quick wickets, G. Brown was unable to bat so the PM's XI were out for 250 and the MCC won by 3 runs. Robert Menzies invited both teams to dinner and at the end of his speech presented a delighted Fred Trueman with a silver tankard as a birthday present from the Australian people. The Duke joked to the Prime Minister [...] "I suppose you know you've just destroyed the disciplinary labours of several months?" ...|$|E

60|$|It was the {{pleading}} cry of {{a strong}} man in distress, but Bill's head did not turn.

He <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> <b>go</b> till he passed over the crest and disappeared.

60|$|He tapped {{and spoke}} to the man. The car swung up by the yew trees. She gave him her hand and said good-bye, naive and brief as a schoolgirl. And she stood <b>watching</b> <b>him</b> <b>go,</b> her face shining. The fact of his driving on meant nothing to her, she was so filled by her own bright ecstacy. She did not see <b>him</b> <b>go,</b> for she was filled with light, which was of him. Bright with an amazing light as she was, how could she miss him.|$|R
60|$|From my seat near {{a window}} I could <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> <b>go,</b> as with {{measured}} steps he passed {{up the hill}} which rises behind the State House, {{and disappeared into the}} shadow of the forest. Then my work claimed me, for I wished to record the proceedings so far whilst all was fresh in my mind. In silence, as of the dead, the Council waited, no man challenging opinion of his neighbour even by a glance.|$|R

Like many of the villagers, Rasa signs up with the Kangani, hoping he can send home money every month for his ailing grandmother.

5000|$|When {{they told}} me Rob was {{probably}} the one, I looked him up and thought, [...] "Yeah, he can do a version of Edward. He’s definitely got that vampire thing going on." [...] And then, when I was on set and I got to <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> <b>go</b> from being Rob to shifting into being Edward, and he actually looked like the Edward in my head, {{it was a really}} bizarre experience. ...He really had it nailed.

60|$|Austin {{wrenched}} it {{from his}} comrade; men came scrambling up the ladder, and in another moment or two they had Jefferson helpless, and set about carrying him to his room. When they laid him in his berth his strength seemed to suddenly melt away, and he lay limp and still, only babbling incoherently. Austin ventured {{to give him a}} sedative, and then, leaving Wall-eye to <b>watch</b> <b>him,</b> <b>went</b> out on deck. Tom, who was waiting for him, made a little deprecatory gesture.|$|R
60|$|The men thanked him, {{and with}} kindly eyes <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> <b>go</b> ashore. The cook went {{down for the}} whisky, and Tim, diving into the forecastle, brought up four mugs.|$|E
60|$|Eunice <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> <b>go,</b> spellbound. Her {{momentary}} spurt {{of wrath}} at the kicking {{of her brother}} had died away, and {{she wished she had}} thought of doing it herself.|$|E

60|$|She {{bowed her}} head in assent. His face twitched sharply as he {{restrained}} himself from speaking again. Then he turned and quietly left the room. She did not <b>watch</b> <b>him</b> <b>go,</b> but stood as he had left her. When, after some time, she heard the grating of his dog-cart on the gravel, and then the sharp trot of hoofs down the frozen road, she dropped herself on the settee, and lay with her bosom against the cushions, looking fixedly at the wall.|$|R
60|$|Brighteyes turned {{without a}} word. He took three paces and Gudruda <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> as he <b>went.</b>|$|R
50|$|She is {{probably}} the person closest to truly understanding Tony Soprano. Over the years, Tony Soprano {{has been able to}} confide in Melfi many things that he has told no one else, not even his associates or his wife, Carmela. However, Melfi and Soprano have an unusual, on-again, off-again relationship. He inwardly fears Melfi's prying into his life during their sessions, but he also fears the results of not dealing with the problem. As a result, she <b>watches</b> <b>him</b> <b>go</b> through frequent mood swings during their time together, sometimes acting playful, other times violent — sometimes acting responsive, other times being cold and distant. At times Soprano also expresses frustration with the pace of his treatment and berates Melfi with short outbursts, when he feels she is not following his train of thought.|$|R
