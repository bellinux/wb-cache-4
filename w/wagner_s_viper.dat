40|$|The {{transposition}} of the Great Man {{into the}} Fittest Survivor {{is at the}} very root of an endemic interchange between the sciences and the arts in late Victorian culture, giving rich metaphoric substance to more heavily concretised scientific terminology. Herbert Spencer s famous phrase, survival of the fittest is, arguably, one of the most commonly transposed and consequently influential scientific expressions of the Victorian period, and as such, one of its most malleable idioms. In Victorian musicology this influence is especially obvious in biographical works which privilege Richard Wagner as the greatest genius of musical history. Thus in Mezzotints in Modern Music (1899) James Huneker declares that Wagner carried within his breast the precious eucharist of genius. It is the attitude of Huneker and like-minded musicologists, like C. Hubert H. Parry, William Wallace, Francis Hueffer and Richard Wallaschek, which forms the basis of a three-part exploration of <b>Wagner</b> <b>s</b> genius, covering (1) the role of endurance in Victorian definitions of genius, from Carlyle and Sully to Galton; (2) the influence of German morphology on evolutionary terminology in Britain, with particular reference to ontogeny, phylogeny and recapitulation; and (3) Spencer s adaptation of German morphology and his influence on Victorian perceptions of <b>Wagner</b> <b>s</b> genius. These collectively argue through the paradigm of Wagner that the formulation of late Victorian musical genius was incomplete without recourse to evolutionary terminology of survival. Indeed, for Victorian musicology, Wagner, the Great Man, had evolved into Wagner, the Fittest Survivor...|$|R

40|$|Background:Snake bite {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{neglected}} public health issues in poor rural communities worldwide. In addition to the clinical effects of envenoming, treatment with antivenom frequently causes serious adverse reactions, including hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) and pyrogenic reactions. We aimed to investigate the immune responses to Sri Lankan snake envenoming (predominantly by Russell 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>viper)</b> and antivenom treatment. Methodology/Principal Findings:Plasma concentrations of Interleukin (IL) - 6, IL- 10, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), soluble TNF receptor I (sTNFRI), anaphylatoxins (C 3 a, C 4 a, C 5 a; markers of complement activation), mast cell tryptase (MCT), and histamine were measured in 120 Sri Lankan snakebite victims, both before and after treatment with antivenom. Immune mediator concentrations were correlated with envenoming features and the severity of antivenom-induced reactions including anaphylaxis. Envenoming was associated with complement activation and increased cytokine concentrations prior to antivenom administration, which correlated with non-specific systemic symptoms of envenoming but not with coagulopathy or neurotoxicity. Typical hypersensitivity reactions to antivenom occurred in 77 / 120 patients (64...|$|R

The results were analyzed using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for ordination of environmental data, and also by ANOVA, Tukey and Z tests to compare sets of data considering the radionu-clides, the two analyzed phases and the six collecting points.

40|$|Stem and {{progenitor}} {{cells have}} been identified in many adult tissues including bone marrow, the central nervous system, and skin. While there is direct evidence to indicate the activity of a progenitor cell population in the pituitary gland, this putative subpopulation has not yet been identified. Herein we describe the isolation and characterization of a novel clonogenic cell type in the adult murine pituitary, which we have termed Pituitary Colony-Forming Cells (PCFCs). PCFCs constitute 0. 2 % of pituitary cells, and generate heterogeneous colonies from single cells. PCFCs exhibit variable proliferative potential, and may exceed 11 population doublings in 14 days. Enrichment of PCFCs to 61. 5 -fold with 100 % recovery can be obtained through the active uptake of the fluorescent dipeptide, β-Ala-Lys-Nε-AMCA. PCFCs are mostly contained within the large, agranular subpopulation of AMCA⁺ cells, and constitute 28 % of this fraction, corresponding to 140. 5 -fold enrichment. Interestingly, the AMCA⁺ population contains rare cells that are GH⁺ or PRL⁺. GH⁺ cells were also identified in PCFC single cell colonies, suggesting that PCFCs have the potential to differentiate into GH⁺ cells. Together, these data show that the pituitary contains a rare clonogenic population which may correspond to the somatotrope/lactotrope progenitors suggested by previous experiments. D. A. Lepore, K.

40|$|Context and objective: Recent studies {{suggested}} that sensory sensitivity could {{be linked to}} food neophobia, described as the reluctance to eat, or the avoidance of, new foods. The objective {{of the present study}} was twofold. Firstly, this study aimed at assessing the links between smell reactivity and taste reactivity in children. Secondly, this study assessed the links between children’s smell/taste reactivity and food neophobia. The hypothesis was that the higher the chemosensory reactivity of the child, the more the child is neophobic. Method: One hundred and three dyads of mother-child, from the Opaline cohort, were involved. The child’s food neophobia was assessed using a validated parent-administered questionnaire (Rigal et al, 2012) when the child was 22 months. The children’s taste reactivity was assessed at 20 months, using an experimental design described in Schwartz et al. (2009), based on the variance of intake scores obtained for 5 tastes. The children’s smell reactivity was assessed at 22 months, using an experimental design described in Wagner et al. (2013), based on the variance of mouthing scores obtained for 4 bottles bearing pleasant food odours and 4 bottles bearing unpleasant food odours. Results: Kendall correlation analyses indicated no significant association between smell reactivity and taste reactivity in children (tau= 0. 06, p= 0. 46). Significant correlations were reported between smell reactivity and children’s neophobia score (tau= 0. 12, p= 0. 04), but not between taste reactivity and children’s neophobia score (tau= 0. 04, p= 0. 29). Discussion: These results suggest that smell reactivity and taste reactivity are differently associated with children’s neophobia. This study highlights that neophobic children are more responsive to smell cues than less neophobic children, but neophobic children seem not to react differently to taste cues than less neophobic children.
