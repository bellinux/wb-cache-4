5000|$|Upon release, Evolve Or Be Extinct has {{received}} fairly positive {{feedback from the}} public and critics. Ash Houghton of SB.TV rounded up his review with: [...] "All in all, Evolve Or Be Extinct is another strong piece of work {{from one of the}} most prolific, multi-talented artists the UK has to offer. Wiley consistently provides a body of work which encompasses his input on all levels, from production to vocals; his name is strewn throughout the album’s credits which, in turn, ensures nothing but the purest sound grime has to offer." [...] Noel Gardner of BBC gave a satisfying review, saying: [...] "A haphazard, sometimes ridiculous, but often impressively inventive new set. In fact, this feels like an album by, for and about himself. Most lyrics unapologetically address the life of Wiley; two baffling skits, in which he quarrels with a taxi driver and customs officer respectively, seem to play up to his hothead reputation. Evolve or Be Extinct will appeal largely to people already <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> it, and <b>who</b> are looking for a full-length to rival his 2004 debut Treddin’ on Thin Ice. This should go some way to satisfying them." [...] Riky Bains of RWD Magazine gave Evolve of Be Extinct a positive review stating: [...] "Wiley is moving in a new direction and throwing new sounds and innovative ideas at a tough audience; just like Charles Darwin. His work wasn’t fully accepted or appreciated till a decade later. Is this album ahead of its time?" ...|$|R

50|$|After inheriting a {{newspaper}} from her father, the socialite Joan Langford clashes with {{the managing editor}} Hank Gilman. He is a hard-bitten newsman who resents her interference in {{the running of the}} paper. Disguising herself as an aspiring young journalist, she gets a job at the paper. Although Gilman is in fact <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>who</b> she is and assigns her to very difficult assignments to convince her that the newspaper business is not for her. However she eventually gains his respect, and together they thwart an attempt at blackmail by Langford's British butler who is revealed to be the head of a society of criminal servants.|$|E
50|$|Exchanges counter that, while {{corruption}} is possible on any gambling platform, the bookies' arguments are motivated not by {{concern for the}} integrity of sport but by commercial interests. Exchanges also assert they are <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>who</b> their customers are and keep a complete record of all betting activity in case of enquiries, whereas high-street bookies take anonymous cash bets. Furthermore, customers can monitor the odds on the exchanges' user-friendly platforms independently. Exchanges and the authorities can be immediately alerted should suspicious betting patterns become apparent. Some exchanges have signed agreements with governing bodies of sport including the Jockey Club, with whom they insist they will co-operate fully if the latter suspects corruption to have taken place. Exchanges have co-operated with police investigations when asked to do so, sometimes leading to arrests.|$|E

Thomas, Jr., blames his father for the deaths of his mother and brother and it is strongly hinted that the main purpose to his criminal career is to punish his father, who is <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>who</b> he is and is equally determined to destroy his own son. During his visit to the [...] "main" [...] DC Universe, upon discovering the Waynes' grave, he states that nothing matters because [...] "he's dead", presumably referring to Thomas Wayne, Sr., and actually shows a rare moment of pathos as he kneels in front of the grave.|$|E
50|$|Catching {{sight of}} a pizza {{delivery}} scooter, she inquires at the local pizza store and learns they make deliveries to Torchwood. Disguised as a pizza delivery girl, she enters a tourist centre where Ianto presses a button to reveal a secret passageway and lets her through. Following it, Gwen eventually finds herself in the Torchwood Hub, where {{the rest of the}} Torchwood team members initially try to ignore her entrance but break into fits of laughter, <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>who</b> she is. Jack shows Gwen around the Hub, including the captured Weevil from the hospital; they then leave the Hub via a pavement slab lift, which takes them to Roald Dahl Plass in front of the fountain. Jack explains that a perception filter exists around the spot they are standing, making them invisible to passersby, explaining why Gwen lost track of the team earlier. Jack takes Gwen to a pub, and over a drink, explains that the purpose of Torchwood is to help monitor and control the flotsam and jetsam of the time-space vortex that falls to Earth through the rift that exists on the site where the Hub was built. As Gwen wonders why Jack is telling her all of this, he explains that he has placed an amnesia pill in her drink, and that she will have forgotten the information by morning. Gwen races home and tries to type out a message to herself before the pill's effects are complete, but falls asleep; Ianto remotely turns off her computer, causing the message to be lost.|$|E
