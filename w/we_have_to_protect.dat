2500|$|After {{the trial}} ended, the District Attorney's office {{received}} numerous open record requests for the videotape. David McDade inquired of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia whether the videotape {{had to be}} released under the Open Records Act. The Council concluded that [...] "if no one has filed for a protection order ... claiming that disclosure of the video tape would invade individual privacy, we can find no reason why disclosure of the video tape is not required under ... the Open Records Act." [...] Ignoring {{the fact that it}} was the Legislature that wrote the Open Records Law (and which caused the initial controversy by refusing to apply the [...] "Romeo and Juliet" [...] clause retroactively), Georgia State Sen. Emanuel Jones said he would introduce legislation to block district attorneys from handing over photographic images in sex cases. [...] "'I'm going to call it the David McDade Act,' Jones said. 'Sometimes <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> our kids from district attorneys.'" [...] Because the participants shown having sex in the video were under 18, the videotape constitutes child pornography under federal law. [...] The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act prohibits prosecutors from allowing defendants in criminal proceedings to possess a copy of any evidence that constitutes child pornography, even if the purpose is to mount a defense against the charge. Under this law, Wilson and his defense team are prohibited from having a copy of the videotape that prosecutor McDade has distributed to anyone else who has requested it.|$|E

Luis Alberto Mendoza, deputy of the center-right National Action Party (PAN), which opposed the law, said it was an [...] "attack against the family, which is society's natural group and is formed by a man and a woman." [...] Other than that, the PCS drew little opposition. Bishop Raúl Vera, who headed the Catholic Diocese of Saltillo, declined to condemn the law. While Vera insisted that [...] "two women or two men cannot get married," [...] he also saw gay people as a vulnerable minority. [...] "Today we live in a society that is composed in a different way. There are people who do not want to marry under the law or in the church. They need legal protection. I should not abandon these people." [...] Unlike Mexico City's law, once same-sex couples have registered in Coahuila, the state protects their rights no matter where they live in the country. Twenty days after the law had passed, the country's first same-sex civil union took place in Saltillo. It was between 29-year-olds Karina Almaguer and Karla Lopez, a lesbian couple from Tamaulipas. Between 2007 and 2010, 196 same-sex couples had entered into a PCS, none of them had been annulled.|$|E
