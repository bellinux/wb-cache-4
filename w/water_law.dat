25|$|The 1906 <b>Water</b> <b>Law</b> (Ley general de aguas) {{marks the}} {{beginning}} of Bolivia's 20th Century water resources policy. The <b>Water</b> <b>Law</b> includes provisions such as water as a public good and establish Bolivian government as main authority responsible for water management. The definition of water rights is vague, “the water passing through the land belongs to the land owner {{as long as it does}} not affect others.” No provision is included for neither groundwater property rights nor water tariffs. The <b>Water</b> <b>Law</b> was minimally modified on 1945, to specify that “no water right includes the right to deny access to water to downstream water users.” In 1988, the Senate prepared a draft to modify the <b>Water</b> <b>Law</b> to include provisions such as groundwater as public domain, and to establish a water fee for farmers based on the area benefited with improved irrigation infrastructure. Similar attempts occurred in 1995 and 1999, when the government together with the World Bank and GTZ drafted a <b>Water</b> <b>Law</b> including some fundamental principles included in the 1988 version plus provisions on institutional framework and concessions of water rights. None of the three drafts turned into a new <b>Water</b> <b>Law.</b>|$|E

25|$|The General <b>Water</b> <b>Law</b> 17752 (Ley General de Aguas, 1969) {{considers}} {{water as}} an agricultural commodity. The 1997 Natural Resources Law 26821 allows {{the transfer of}} water rights, including irrigation, from one party to another, which is incompatible with the General <b>Water</b> <b>Law,</b> and presents significant obstacles to the establishment and management of water property rights.|$|E

25|$|The National <b>Water</b> <b>Law</b> of 2007 was {{approved}} by the National Assembly and regulates water use by different sectors while prioritizing potable water supplies for domestic use. The <b>Water</b> <b>Law</b> aims to protect and preserve the country’s water resources. Furthermore, Nicaragua’s congressional environment and natural resources committee has also approved its 2010 work plan giving priority {{to the creation of the}} national water authority (ANA). Under the <b>Water</b> <b>Law,</b> ANA will be a decentralized organization, with administrative and financial autonomy. ANA will be responsible for drawing up a national water resources plan, keeping track of water levels in basins, maintaining a public registry of water rights, and promoting the use and development of water resources. The authority is also expected to monitor the construction of water infrastructure. The establishment of ANA has been delayed by 2 years. The delay is due in part for two reasons: 1) implementing the <b>water</b> <b>law</b> is expensive; and 2) there exists disagreements over who should lead that agency.|$|E
25|$|The newly {{approved}} <b>Water</b> <b>Law</b> (Ley de Recursos Hídricos – LRH, published March 31, 2009) has {{enhanced the}} National Water Resources System (substituting Decree No. 1081) which now consist of ANA, a National Water Resources Court, River Basin Councils, {{regional and local}} governments and water users organizations. However, some institutions foreseen under the law, such as the River Basin Councils, remain to be created. The <b>water</b> <b>law</b> also establishes priority uses of water, re-defines water user rights, understands water as an economic good, defines sanctions, considers river basins as management units and incorporates groundwater management considerations. It is foreseen that subsidiary legislation (reglamentos) will complement the <b>water</b> <b>law</b> by specifying, for instance, the roles of each institution within the National Water Resources System.|$|E

25|$|The campesino and {{indigenous}} community have never paid for water use. This {{together with the}} fact that they are the poorest group in Bolivia has traditionally excluded this group for water user tariffs in <b>Water</b> <b>Law</b> drafted in the past. Moreover, the <b>Water</b> <b>Law</b> of 1906 does not either establish a system to grant water rights. Hence to this date, there is no document or title defining who and to which extent water can be used in Bolivia.|$|E

The State of Honduras is working on a new General <b>Water</b> <b>Law</b> to replace the 1927 Law on Using National Waters and designed to regulate water use and management. The new <b>water</b> <b>law</b> will also create a Water Authority, and the National Council of Water Resources which will serve as an advising and consultative body.|$|E

40|$|The {{shortage}} of {{water as a}} resource {{is a threat to}} which both Ethiopia and England are exposed. This vulnerability of the countries necessitates the question of whether existing management systems for water resources will promote the sustainability of such resources. With growing natural resource insecurity over the last fifty years, the tragedy of the commons and the integrated water resources management (IWRM) approach are at the forefront. This study evaluates the tragedy of the commons and the IWRM approach to identify key features of effective water resource management (WRM) systems. The study also assesses the effectiveness of English and Ethiopian systems by reference to their salient features, to explore {{the extent to which the}} major facets of an effective system are reflected within the countries <b>water</b> policies and <b>laws.</b> The evaluation demonstrates that in the case study countries, some such factors have already been reflected within their <b>water</b> policies and <b>laws.</b> From the overall review of each countries' water policies, it may be argued that the contemporary policies that are in place generally accommodate some of the main attributes of an effective management system for water resources if they are accompanied by proper <b>water</b> <b>laws,</b> implementation strategies and institutional remits that are designed to promote water security. However, while some key features of an effective WRM system can already be seen in the case study countries' <b>water</b> <b>laws,</b> the initiatives which have been taken are limited and varied. Particularly, in Ethiopian WRM systems, the progress made to incorporate the main elements into binding law were slow. Even if some features have been reflected within the <b>water</b> <b>laws</b> of both jurisdictions, theirs scope is limited and incomprehensive. Moreover, their implementations are weak and incomplete in both jurisdictions. This study demonstrates that there has not been much deviation from the 'traditional' way of managing water resources...|$|R

25|$|The 1927 Law on Using National Waters (Ley Vigente de Aprovechamiento de Aguas Nacionales) was a {{major step}} for Honduras in water {{resource}} management (WRM). This law however, did not recognize multi-sectoral uses of water, therefore, water use in each WRM sector became regulated by their own respective sectoral law. Furthermore, major institutions such as SANAA, CONASA, and ERSAPS have operational functions in both water and sanitation services. As of August 2009, Honduras has passed a new General <b>Water</b> <b>Law</b> with a National Water Authority to provide regulation and oversight to institutions responsible for distinct sectors of water resource management.
