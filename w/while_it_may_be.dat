5|$|The longest living eastern {{green mamba}} was a captive {{specimen}} which lived for 18.8 years. Another captive specimen lived for 14 years. However, <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> possible for wild specimens {{to live that}} long, they {{are thought to have}} shorter lifespans in general due to the threats of predation, habitat loss, disease, and other biological and environmental factors.|$|E
5|$|Finally, in {{practice}} {{one wants to}} approximate the function with {{a finite number of}} terms, say with a Taylor polynomial or a partial sum of the trigonometric series, respectively. In the case of the Taylor series the error is very small in a neighbourhood of the point where it is computed, <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> very large at a distant point. In the case of the Fourier series the error is distributed along the domain of the function.|$|E

5|$|<b>While</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{uncertain}} when cultivation began it {{is still}} {{considered one of the}} oldest domesticated crops. Remains of charred cowpeas from rock shelters in Central Ghana have been dated to the second millennium BCE. In 2300 BC the cowpea is believed to have made its way into South East Asia where secondary domestication events may have occurred. From there they traveled north to the Mediterranean, where they were used by the Greeks and Romans. The first written references to the cowpea were in 300 BC and they probably reached Central and North America during the slave trade through the 17th to early 19th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Kings did {{not rule}} alone, but rather governed {{together}} with the leading churchmen and nobles. While Northumbria lacks the body of charters which {{shed light on the}} institutions of the southern Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, sufficient evidence survives for historians to reconstruct some aspects of Northumbrian political life. The evidence for Northumbria survives largely in Latin documents, and these use the words dux and patricius to describe the leading noblemen of the kingdom. The word dux is usually translated by the Old English word ealdorman. The historian Alan Thacker estimates that there were about eight men holding the title of dux in late Northumbria. The title patricius is usually translated as patrician, which ultimately means noble, but in the latter days of the Roman Empire represented a high-ranking position, second only to the emperor. The meaning of the title in Northumbria is unclear, but it appears that there was only one patricius. <b>While</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> simply an alternative to dux, it might represent a position approximating to that of the Mayor of the Palace in late Merovingian Francia.|$|E

25|$|The initial {{treatment}} for testicular cancer is {{surgery to remove}} the affected testicle (orchiectomy). <b>While</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> possible, in some cases, to remove testicular cancer tumors from a testis while leaving the testis functional, this is almost never done, as the affected testicle usually contains pre-cancerous cells spread throughout the entire testicle. Thus removing the tumor alone without additional treatment greatly increases the risk that another cancer will form in that testicle.|$|E
25|$|Civil {{inattention}} {{is defined}} as the polite way to manage interaction with strangers by not engaging in any interpersonal communication or needing to respond to a stranger’s touch. Goffman uses an elevator study to explain this phenomenon.

25|$|An {{example of}} a {{negative}} feedback is that radiation leaving the Earth increases {{in proportion to the}} fourth power of temperature, in accordance with the Stefan-Boltzmann law. This feedback is always operational; therefore, <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> overridden by positive feedbacks for comparatively small temperature changes it will dominate for larger temperature changes. An {{example of a}} positive feedback is the ice-albedo feedback, in which increasing temperature causes ice to melt, which increases the amount of heat that Earth absorbs. This feedback only operates in a restricted range of temperatures (those for which ice exists, and does not cover the whole surface; once all the ice has melted, the feedback ceases to operate).|$|E

500|$|Guitar Hero III Mobile {{was well}} {{received}} upon its release. IGN considered {{it to be}} a [...] "successful adaptation" [...] of the Guitar Hero games to the cellphone keypad. They commented that <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> tricky to download the songs for the game, requiring the user to be persistent during the download, the sound quality was excellent and the simplification down to three buttons from five makes the game [...] "accessible to anybody with even a passing curiosity." [...] CNET praised the quality of the sound and animations, as well as the ease of play. Cell Play referred to the game as [...] "the true mobile port of rock," [...] and praised the level of difficulty accomplished with the three button setup. They considered the shortened song length a negligible downside compared to the overall package. 1UPs review criticized the compact layout that led to hand cramps, and that the limited space on the mobile version only allowed two songs to be stored at a time. 1UP also lamented the shorted versions of the songs given the outstanding audio quality achieved on the mobile platform; their review summarized their experience as [...] "As a literal interpretation of the Guitar Hero formula, there was apparently no room to alter the game to emphasize the strengths of the mobile platform." [...] Guitar Hero III Mobile won two awards at the Qualcomm 2008 BREW Developers Conference for [...] "Best Game" [...] and [...] "People's Choice Award". The game has been downloaded by users 2.5 million times, with both Verizon and Hands-On Mobile claiming that over 250,000 songs are played a day on the platform.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from January 7, 1911. It states, [...] "Miss Street's Seminary for Girls has a very ambitious class of pupils. The young athletes, not content with basketball and tennis, aspire to shine in the great American game, and organize a baseball club. They are so satisfied with themselves that they finally send a challenge to Adair College, which has a crowd of husky young athletes in a club that thinks it amounts to something. When the challenge is received, the boys are first angry, then amused. They decide to accept it, {{to have fun with}} the girls. The young women, after some practice, realize that their team, <b>while</b> <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> pretty to look at, is of little real use on the diamond. And the prospect makes them weep. Fortunately for the girls, Jack, the brother of the president, arrives from Harvard. His chum, Jim, is with him. These two young men are baseball stars themselves, and when they are told of the predicament of the girls, they goodnaturedly offer to help them out. The university men disguise themselves as girls, act as battery for the young women, and the college boys, who had looked for a laughable victory, are mowed down, inning after inning, because of the work of pitcher Jack and catcher Jim. The other members of the 'girl' team have nothing to do except look pretty. When the boy athletes have retired from the field vanquished, the girls reward their battery with one kiss - only one - from each of the other seven players." ...|$|E
