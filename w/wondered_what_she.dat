60|$|Randal <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> could {{possibly}} be thinking of and acknowledged it in so many words.|$|E
60|$|He glanced {{quickly at}} Sally, he <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was thinking, {{and then looked}} away again.|$|E
60|$|While {{she rested}} and <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> could do next, a farmer came along, driving an empty cart.|$|E
5000|$|... "I <b>Wonder</b> <b>What</b> <b>She's</b> Doing Tonight" [...] - Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart ...|$|R
5000|$|I <b>Wonder</b> <b>What</b> <b>She's</b> Doing Tonight (Tommy Boyce / Bobby Hart) - 2:59 ...|$|R
60|$|Joan started. She {{had been}} {{thinking}} about Phillips, <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> should say to him when they met.|$|R
6000|$|She {{walked into}} McQueen's surgery and said, [...] "Could you not cut it out?" [...] so {{abruptly}} that he <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was speaking about.|$|E
6000|$|But Mrs. Lowder fronted her so on {{this that}} she <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had said. [...] "I suppose I {{ought to be}} edified at what you can so beautifully give up." ...|$|E
6000|$|Festing <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant {{and whether}} {{she knew about}} the portrait, but she resumed: [...] "As a matter of fact, my mother and I felt that we knew you rather well." ...|$|E
60|$|Weston was startled, but she {{saw that}} he would not allow himself to <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> really did mean.|$|R
50|$|<b>What</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>she's</b> weary, <b>what</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>she's</b> wan.|$|R
60|$|GEO. Never heard {{anything}} like it; tongue journalled on ball-bearings! I <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> said; {{seemed to be}} swearing, mainly.|$|R
60|$|He looked {{sideways}} at Barbara and <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was so thoughtfully frowning over. Oh, lovely and delicate young creature! What could he adequately say {{of death and}} beauty and tenderness? Tenderness....|$|E
6000|$|... "Is that you, Euchre?" [...] asked a girl's voice, low, hesitatingly. The tone of it, rather {{deep and}} with a note of fear, struck Duane. He <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would be like.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "yes," [...] and <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{could say}} or do. It {{seemed to him}} that her {{shrinking}} pose was the most tenderly modest thing he had ever seen.|$|E
60|$|I know. I {{have some}} {{authority}} {{in the affairs of}} this country, but none over dear Christina. I <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants.|$|R
50|$|Jessica has {{lunch with}} her mother, who advises she visits a psychiatrist. She reluctantly agrees and <b>wonders</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> will tell her psychiatrist.|$|R
6000|$|... "Be comforted," [...] I replied, <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{might mean}} by this loosing of the Powers. [...] "I {{think that she}} loves him too well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, by heart--that's nothing!" [...] she murmured, smiling. [...] "My aunt {{used to know}} him--to know him"--she paused {{an instant}} and I <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was going to say--"to know him as a visitor." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. and Mrs. Marshall Elliott {{were living}} comfortably and harmoniously {{in the green}} house. Leslie was busy with sewing, for she and Owen were to be married at Christmas. Anne <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would do when Leslie was gone.|$|E
60|$|There was {{something}} very constrained and cold about her manner, and Ned <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> could {{want to say to}} him just at the present time. She came out directly he sent in {{to say that he was}} there.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; {{she would}} {{certainly}} have been found dead at {{the door in the}} morning had she been left out all night. I <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> has gone through?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{whatever}} {{she is to}} him, she's a civilised white woman, and that's a sight worth seeing in those regions. I <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> like?" [...] said I.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; that's because he's dead. Well, {{she carries}} on the {{ointment}} now, I believe; at any rate, she has {{got all the}} money. I <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> like." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{feared that}} Lucille heard her, and <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> thought. Our mode {{of life was}} widely {{different}} from that at Bonaventure and from {{what would have been}} for me possible had I not fallen into the hands of Lane.|$|E
60|$|It was not long, for the Restless had a fair wind, {{before the}} sail to the eastward came fully into sight. She was, in good truth, a merchantman, {{and not a}} large one. Dame Charter, very much excited, <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would have on board.|$|E
60|$|In {{his place}} I {{should have been}} more embarrassed and less calm. She had {{laughing}} eyes and a most charming mouth. She was young. I <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> found so attractive in Strickland. She made no secret of her desires, and I was bidden to translate.|$|E
60|$|But {{she could}} do nothing {{as long as the}} emperor {{remained}} with his wife night and day, and <b>she</b> began to <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> could do to get him away from her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> means," [...] mused Brant, as her quick step {{died away}} in the passage. [...] "One thing is certain,--a woman like that is {{altogether}} too impulsive for a spy." ...|$|R
60|$|Tess, meanwhile, {{as the one}} who {{had dragged}} her parents into this quagmire, was silently <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> could do to help them out of it; and then her mother {{broached}} her scheme.|$|R
6000|$|In {{these long}} hours his thought played about the remembrance {{of his last}} visit to the Fork and his hour with Lee. He <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was doing at the moment. How charming she had looked there at Redfields'--so girlish in form, so serious and womanly of face! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{poor woman}} was in despair at {{witnessing}} her husband's undignified actions and <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{might do to}} control him. The professor seemed more grave than usual; the senator's face wore an offended expression, and Bessie kept moving her fingers as if she still wanted to play the piano.|$|E
60|$|Josie, {{crouching}} {{beside the}} secret entrance, <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> ought to do. The regular thumping, as of machinery, {{which she had}} heard once before, now began and continued without interruption. Here {{was an opportunity to}} catch the counterfeiters redhanded, but she was one small girl as opposed to a gang of desperate criminals.|$|E
6000|$|... "She WAS a {{stunning}} girl," [...] he said. [...] "I wonder if I shall ever {{set eyes on}} her again. And {{she knew how to}} ride, too! <b>Wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> thought of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|FANNY [leaning over a chair, she {{is staring}} {{into the eyes of}} the first Lady Bantock]. I <b>wonder</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would have done if she had ever got herself into a really {{first-class}} muddle? ...|$|R
50|$|Bert is {{together}} with Nadja, but Nadja more seems to show interest {{for playing the}} violin than hanging with Bert. Bert also <b>wonders</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is doing with Rasmus, a guy she plays music with.|$|R
