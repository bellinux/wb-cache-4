40|$|People <b>with</b> {{learning}} disabilities (<b>LDs)</b> {{are likely to}} be at greater risk of having crimes committed against them, and testimony from witnesses <b>with</b> <b>LDs</b> is likely to be crucial when many of these crimes are prosecuted. The present authors analysed the transcripts of 16 court cases involving witnesses <b>with</b> <b>LDs</b> and 16 matched court cases involving witnesses without LDs. On the basis of this information and previous research, they discuss three issues: (1) the strengths and vulnerabilities of people <b>with</b> <b>LDs</b> as witnesses in court; (2) the kinds of questioning used by lawyers in courtrooms which can cause problems for witnesses with LDs; and (3) guidance for practitioners concerning alerting the judge to their role in preventing constraining and coercive lawyer questioning in court. The authors conclude that many people <b>with</b> <b>LDs</b> can be competent witnesses in court, but that hostile lawyers in particular use constraining and coercive questioning strategies which have a particularly negative impact on the testimony of witnesses <b>with</b> <b>LDs.</b> Judges should be informed of appropriate and inappropriate lawyer questioning strategies in advance of trials to enable them to effectively manage the questioning of lawyers in the courtroom.

Using a case study design, series of three in-depth interviews were conducted with five individuals <b>with</b> <b>LDs</b> and <b>with</b> their parents. Data were analyzed inductively. The findings indicate that the families all had informal transition plans; formal transition plans were not written. For four of the families, the transition process was successful and occurred in two phases spanning the elementary and secondary school years. In the first phase parents controlled the transition process, and during the second phase they transferred this responsibility to their children <b>with</b> <b>LDs.</b> Parents’ high expectations and advocacy; students’ hard work, self-determination and self-advocacy; and teachers’ mentoring and support also contributed to the achievement of transition goals.

Principals were also interviewed to corroborate data. Two-hundred and seventy-eight general education teachers participated on the online survey administered via Qualtrics and ten principals were interviewed in this study. The survey instrument was analyzed for validity and reliability. More than half the teachers currently had or previously had students <b>with</b> <b>LDs.</b> Teacher preparation, academic climate, teaching approaches, teaching strategies and teacher effectiveness were themes that emerged from factor analysis. The ANOVA test identified statistically significant relationships between-years of experience, degree field, and expertise in special education. The degree field, route of certification, expertise in special education, and having students <b>with</b> <b>LDs</b> in classroom was related to the teaching strategy employed by teachers. Teacher effectiveness was related to degree field, with expertise in special education and also with if they have had students <b>with</b> <b>LDs.</b> The academic climate in schools was enhanced by the presence of resource room. General education teachers had a positive attitude towards inclusion and provide multiple strategies for accommodating students with learning disabilities. Class size was considered critical by most general teachers when inclusion was being provided. Principals interviewed in this study reported that teachers had negative attitudes towards inclusion of students <b>with</b> <b>LDs</b> and believed that instructing students <b>with</b> <b>LDs</b> was no different from teaching regular students. Teachers desired smaller class sizes when they had students <b>with</b> <b>LDs</b> in their classrooms. Teachers who were currently were having students <b>with</b> <b>LDs</b> in the classroom requested more information on specialized teaching strategies, ways to individualize their instruction, and more information about accommodations to the curriculum. Teachers certified by traditional routes, requested more training regarding special education laws, asked for more information about accommodations to the curriculum, and sought more assistance in the classroom.

The participants are 293 typically developing adolescents (TD group) and 50 adolescents <b>with</b> learning disabilities (<b>LD</b> group), aged between 13 and 20. The following measures were administered: the Emotional Autonomy Scale (EAS), the Loneliness and Aloneness Scale for Children and Adolescents (LACA), the Assessment of Interpersonal Relations (AIR), and the Multidimensional Self Concept Scale (MSCS). The data showed that adolescents <b>with</b> <b>LDs</b> display significantly higher levels of peer-related loneliness, and lower levels of self-concept and perceived quality of relationships with parents and teachers. No significant differences emerged between the groups in emotional autonomy and in parent-related loneliness. Path analysis indicated that, in adolescents <b>with</b> <b>LDs,</b> emotional autonomy was more closely related to self-concept than in typically developing adolescents. A positive teacher-adolescent relationship could have a moderating effect on the relationships between the dimension considered only in the LD group.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Special Educational Needs (SEN) in Jordanian schools {{appears to be in}} a state of confusion. Numerous obstacles exist that hinder teachers from providing sufficient services for children with learning difficulties. This study investigates the current service provision for students with learning difficulties in Jordanian schools. Semi-structured interviews (N= 31) with SEN teachers were conducted in two phases (23 and 8 respectively). Goffman (1963) was utilised as a theoretical framework, to interpret and understand the data, especially concerning that of social stigma. The analysis revealed that SEN teachers in Jordan faced various difficulties responding to the needs of their students <b>with</b> learning difficulties (<b>LDs),</b> which inevitably had a negative effect upon their performance. The results indicated that the difficulties arose from: parents who denied the disability of their children, classroom teachers who refused to cooperate with resource room teachers (responsible for teaching children <b>with</b> <b>LDs),</b> pre-service teachers who had little training in SEN, non-disabled peers who bullied their disabled peers, school administrators who had little understanding of the needs of children <b>with</b> <b>LDs,</b> and finally the Ministry of Education’s supervisors who were better equipped to support the educational needs of typically developing children. These negative attitudes are rooted strongly in local culture and seem to overlap with expressed religious values. Negative attitudes also varied among parents according to their socio-economic class and the type of school (public and private) their child attended. It appeared that the services provided in private schools were more in tune with the needs of children <b>with</b> <b>LDs</b> than those in public schools. Ultimately, I conclude that there is an urgent need for the reconstruction of services in Jordan to support children <b>with</b> <b>LDs.</b> Teacher training should be aimed specifically at equipping resource room teachers to cater effectively for students <b>with</b> <b>LDs,</b> and legislation should facilitate a shift of responsibility to the Jordanian Ministry of Education and away from the Ministry of Social Development.
