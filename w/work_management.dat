2500|$|Speaking {{at a press}} {{briefing}} in Sandton after the confrontation, AMCU president Joseph Mathunjwa said management had reneged on commitments it had made to miners earlier in the week, claiming the shootings {{could have been avoided}} if management made good on their commitments to workers. Mthunjwa presented two documents in evidence mine management had indeed made commitments to the miners their grievances would be dealt with, but reneged, causing the violence. [...] "Management could have stuck with their commitment. The commitment was once you're there peacefully at <b>work,</b> <b>management</b> will address your grievances through union structures," [...] stated Mathunjwa, who noted he tried to help even though the confrontation did not involve his ACMU union. [...] "This was an in-fight of the members of NUM with their offices. It's {{got nothing to do with}} AMCU.". Mathunjwa explained Amcu's leaders had been called to the site to intervene in the standoff between workers and the mine as a peaceful intermediary, even though the ACMU did not represent those involved in the dispute. [...] "I pleaded with them. I said leave this place, they're going to kill you," [...] said Mathunjwa, who later broke down in tears.|$|E

40|$|Background: Early {{graduate}} occupational therapists (OTs) and physiotherapists (PTs) {{are routinely}} employed in <b>work</b> injury <b>management</b> and prevention in Australia. However, our understanding is limited about employer requirements for early graduates entering the field, and how commencing practitioners manage transition to practice. In addition, employers have expressed concerns anecdotally about the preparedness of early graduates for <b>work</b> injury <b>management</b> and prevention. However, evidence is limited about early gradutate preparedness for the field. Objectives: The study {{aimed to develop}} a detailed qualitative account of the perceptions of employers and early graduates on the attributes required of early graduates in <b>work</b> injury <b>management</b> and prevention, and processes for effective transition to practice in this field. Method: A purposive sample of 12 employers and 12 early graduates in <b>work</b> injury <b>management</b> and prevention participated in semi-structured interviews. Questions to employers focused on recruitment, supervision and readiness for practice. Questions to early graduates focused on challenges in transition and effective learning methods. Transcripts were analysed by Leximancer™ and supported by manual coding and synthesis. Results: Four themes with findings were, 1) 2 ̆ 7 Job and workplace requirements 2 ̆ 7; skills required by employers and support needed for early graduates, 2) 2 ̆ 7 Learning for <b>work</b> injury <b>management</b> and prevention 2 ̆ 7; options for early graduate development and learning methods early graduates found effective, 3) 2 ̆ 7 Employer expectations of early graduates in transition to <b>work</b> injury <b>management</b> and prevention 2 ̆ 7, responses to transition; and 4) 2 ̆ 7 Early graduate perceptions on transition to <b>work</b> injury <b>management</b> and prevention 2 ̆ 7; early graduates responses to transition. Conclusion: Findings for employers and early graduates {{were similar to those}} expected in other areas of practice for OTs and PTs. <b>Work</b> injury <b>management</b> and prevention skills were not expected of early graduates by employers. Employers and early graduates shared similar views that clinical education in <b>work</b> injury <b>management</b> and prevention was useful to early graduates entering this field.

The staff performance will affect decision-making in improving the service quality. Objective: This study aimed to analyze the relationship between stress <b>management,</b> <b>work</b> motivation and work performance. Method: This was an analytic observational study with a cross sectional approach.
