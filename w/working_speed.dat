50|$|Cataracts {{were also}} used as an {{over-speed}} safety device for direct-acting water pumps. A seesaw or 'differential' lever was placed between the pump's piston rod and a cataract adjusted for the pump's normal <b>working</b> <b>speed.</b> If the pump suddenly accelerated, owing to the pump bursting or similar, the piston would overtake the cataract and {{the action of the}} differential lever would then close the pump's steam inlet valve and stop the pump, limiting possible damage.|$|E

50|$|Grinding {{wheels are}} {{designed}} to be run at a maximum safe speed, the spindle speed of the grinding machine may be variable but this should only be changed with due attention to the safe <b>working</b> <b>speed</b> of the wheel. As a wheel wears it will decrease in diameter, and its effective cutting speed will be reduced. Some grinders have the provision to increase the spindle speed, which corrects for this loss of cutting ability; however, increasing the speed beyond the wheels rating will destroy the wheel and create a serious hazard to life and limb.|$|E

A second technology which is gaining widespread acceptance in Europe, Germany in particular, is high-speed grinding. While it cannot reprofile rails like milling or other grinding trains, its <b>working</b> <b>speed</b> of approximately 80 km/h allows defect removal and prevention to be achieved with little or no impact on other scheduled traffic.|$|E

She continued 'Many women have no training in home making, and packaged and ready-prepared foods, like cereals, cake, pastry and biscuit mixes, canned and frozen foods, make life easier'. A selection of 'hot muffins made with bran' were handed out and Fulton told the listeners that 'These are quick and easy to make and most economical'.|$|E

40|$|With {{computerized}} testing, it {{is possible}} to record both the responses of test takers to test questions (i. e., items) and {{the amount of time spent}} by a test taker in responding to each question. Various models have been proposed that take into account both test-taker ability and <b>working</b> <b>speed,</b> with the many models assuming a constant <b>working</b> <b>speed</b> throughout the test. The constant <b>working</b> <b>speed</b> assumption may be inappropriate for various reasons. For example, a test taker may need to adjust the pace due to time mismanagement, or a test taker who started out working too fast may reduce the <b>working</b> <b>speed</b> to improve accuracy.

40|$|The {{position}} {{effect is a}} possible source of impairment of the structural validity of a test concerning model fit. In the case of tests with a time limit {{there is even a}} complication of the situation because of a decreasing number of participants completing the last few items of the test. Therefore, it is assumed that the appropriate representation of the {{position effect}} must additionally consider interruption due to the time limit and the effect of <b>working</b> <b>speed.</b> Interruption can be represented by the same latent variable as the position effect whereas the contribution of <b>working</b> <b>speed</b> requires another one. Confirmatory factor models including a representation of the position effect as a linear, quadratic or logarithmic increase were compared with models additionally considering interruption as a logistic decrease or simply as immediate interruption. Furthermore, there were models additionally considering <b>working</b> <b>speed.</b> In the sample of 305 participants the investigation of probability-based covariances made apparent that the modeling of interruption and also <b>working</b> <b>speed</b> substantially improved model fit.

50|$|A turbine is {{theoretically}} {{more reliable}} {{and easier to}} maintain than a piston engine, since it has a simpler construction with fewer moving parts but in practice turbine parts experience a higher wear rate due to their higher <b>working</b> <b>speeds.</b> The turbine blades are highly sensitive to dust and fine sand, so that in desert operations air filters have to be fitted and changed several times daily. An improperly fitted filter, or a bullet or shell fragment that punctures the filter, can damage the engine. Piston engines (especially if turbocharged) also need well-maintained filters, but they are more resilient if the filter does fail.|$|R
