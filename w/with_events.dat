5|$|For {{narrative}} {{history the}} principal sources are the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and the Irish annals. The evidence from charters {{created in the}} Kingdom of England provides occasional insight into events in northern Britain. While Scandinavian sagas describe events in 10th-century Britain, their value as sources of historical narrative, rather than documents of social history, is disputed. Mainland European sources rarely concern themselves with affairs in Britain, and even less commonly <b>with</b> <b>events</b> in northern Britain, but the life of Saint Cathróe of Metz, a work of hagiography written in Germany {{at the end of}} the 10th century, provides plausible details of the saint's early life in north Britain.|$|E

5|$|Other {{theories}} include André Chastagnol's minimalist {{opinion that}} the author was a pagan who supported the Senate and the Roman aristocracy and scorned the lower classes and the barbarian races, while François Paschoud proposed that the last books of the History are in fact a type of alternative historical narrative, <b>with</b> <b>events</b> and the personalities of recent 4th century emperors woven {{into the fabric of}} a series of 3rd century emperors.
