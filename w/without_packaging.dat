Major comment: Test the clock and clock-proxy auction designs We believe {{it is a mistake}} to focus all attention on the simultaneous multiple round auction (with and <b>without</b> <b>package</b> bids), given that there is substantial theory and experience suggesting that a clock auction or clock-proxy auction would perform better in the FCC setting.

The characterization of the salt distribution profile in Reino cheese was conducted by determining the percentage content of sodium chloride (w/w) in the central, intermediate and superficial portions. Analysis of variance indicated that {{there was no difference between}} treatments in the distribution of salt in Reino cheese, however, there were differences between cheese portion analyzed and maturation time, which showed dependence of the distribution of salt depending on these variables.
