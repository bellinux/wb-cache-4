5|$|Rubidium and caesium {{are often}} used in atomic clocks. Caesium atomic clocks are {{extraordinarily}} accurate; if a clock had been made {{at the time of}} the dinosaurs, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>off</b> by less than four seconds (after 80 million years). For that reason, caesium atoms are used as the definition of the second. Rubidium ions {{are often used}} in purple fireworks, and caesium is often used in drilling fluids in the petroleum industry.|$|E
5|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the gas station, the crew rented out a 7-11 for a day. When Hurley drove in, the van was actually being pushed instead of driven to eliminate any sound from the vehicle. However, every time the van was pushed it would stall or the timing <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>off.</b> Once that problem had been solved, it started to rain, but eventually it stopped and the crew {{was able to get}} the shots before ending shooting at midnight. Hurley's dream scene was shot in the Hawaii Film Studio, where the hatch had been constructed. After each take of Hurley eating food in the hatch, the old food would be replaced with newer food. Garcia did not actually eat all the food though, he would sometimes just chew it and then spit it out into a garbage can. The chicken head that Bose had to wear was extremely heavy, causing actor Daniel Dae Kim to have to hold it up while Bose delivered his lines.|$|E
5|$|On 27 June 1978, {{three months}} after the revolution, Amin managed to outmaneuver the Parchamites at a Central Committee meeting. The meeting decided that the Khalqists had {{exclusive}} rights to formulate and decide policy, a policy which left the Parchamites impotent. Karmal was exiled, but was able to establish a network with the remaining Parchamites in government. A coup to overthrow Amin was planned for September. Its leading members in Afghanistan were Qadir, the defence minister, and Army Chief of Staff General Shahpur Ahmedzai. The coup was planned for 4 September, on the Festival of Eid, because soldiers and officers <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>off</b> duty. The conspiracy failed when the Afghan ambassador to India told the Afghan leadership about the plan. A purge was initiated, and Parchamite ambassadors were recalled; few returned, for example Karmal and Mohammad Najibullah both stayed in their assigned countries.|$|E

25|$|Before 2011, a cab's {{availability}} {{was indicated}} by {{the lights on the}} top of the car. When no lights were lit, the cab would be occupied by passengers. When just the center light showing the medallion number was lit, the cab would be empty and available. When the OFF and DUTY inscriptions to either side of the medallion number were lit, with the medallion number off, the cab <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>off</b> duty and not accepting passengers. However, when the OFF and DUTY inscriptions were lit and the medallion number was still lit, the cab <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>off</b> duty but the driver could choose to pick up passengers heading in the same direction as the driver. In fall 2011, the TLC announced a plan to replace the three-light system with a simple indicator as to whether the taxi is available. In 2012, the TLC simplified the light system further, with a lit roof light indicating that the taxi is available and an unlit light indicating that the taxi is not available, regardless of whether it has passengers or is simply off duty. It also started fining drivers $100 for picking up passengers without the light on, except for if the driver is picking up their last passenger of their shift.|$|E
25|$|At 13:30 on 28 May, the Italians {{believed}} that three cruisers and six destroyers of the Royal Navy were steaming up towards the northern coast of Crete {{in support of}} Allied troops, but the Royal Navy was fully occupied evacuating the Crete garrison. The Italians assumed that the Royal Navy force <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>off</b> Sitia, the planned landing site, by 17:00 and the commander decided that the slowest ship of the convoy would be taken in tow by Lince to increase speed and Crispi was detached to shell the lighthouse at Cape Sideros. The 3,000 men of the division and their equipment were on shore by 17:20 and advanced west unopposed, rendezvousing with the Germans at Ierapetra. The Italian troops later moved their headquarters from Sitia to Agios Nikolaos.|$|E
500|$|On February 3, 2005, it was {{announced}} that Enterprise had been cancelled. This news was passed to the cast and crew during the sixth day of production on [...] "In a Mirror, Darkly". The end of the series marked the first time in 18 years that no new Star Trek episodes were scheduled for broadcast, and Enterprise was the first live-action series of the franchise since The Original Series to last less than seven years. Braga said at a talk to students in Los Angeles shortly after the news of the cancellation was released that [...] "After 18 straight years on the air and 750-some episodes the current run of Star Trek is over. Which is a good thing. It needs a rest". He added that he wasn't sure how long Star Trek <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>off</b> the air, but called it a [...] "gestation" [...] instead of a [...] "cancellation".|$|E

500|$|Frank Orr, a {{columnist}} in the Toronto Star, suggested that Hextall's aggressive nature, {{which resulted in}} three suspensions of six or more games during his NHL career, was an intentional part of his game designed to protect him. He theorized that because Hextall's style of play frequently took {{him out of his}} goal crease, the threat of physical violence lessened the chances of him being challenged by an attacker when out of position. In the 1993 playoff series between the Montreal Canadiens and Hextall's Nordiques, the Canadiens' coach Jacques Demers designed a plan to disrupt Hextall's play after Montreal had lost its two first games to Quebec. He noted that Hextall <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>off</b> his game if he were disturbed or bumped. Montreal then won four straight games to win the series in six games. Demers felt that Hextall's emotional play lessened his effectiveness; while acknowledging him as a [...] "great competitor", he felt that [...] "he didn't reach the level of a Grant Fuhr or a Martin Brodeur [...] he lost his cool if you got in his face." ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} {{mechanisms}} by which strings of digits can represent numbers. In common mathematical notation, the digit string can be of any length, {{and the location of}} the radix point is indicated by placing an explicit [...] "point" [...] character (dot or comma) there. If the radix point is not specified, then the string implicitly represents an integer and the unstated radix point <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>off</b> the right-hand end of the string, next to the least significant digit. In fixed-point systems, a position in the string is specified for the radix point. So a fixed-point scheme might be to use a string of 8 decimal digits with the decimal point in the middle, whereby [...] "00012345" [...] would represent 0001.2345.|$|E

2500|$|In a January 5, 1995, {{interview}} with Kathleen Gingrich, mother of Republican politician Newt Gingrich, on Eye to Eye, Mrs. Gingrich {{said she could}} not say what her son thought about First Lady Hillary Clinton on the air. Chung asked Mrs. Gingrich to [...] "just whisper it to me, just between you and me," [...] and Mrs. Gingrich replied that her son thought of Clinton as a [...] "bitch".

2500|$|While {{these events}} were taking place, Alcidas {{advanced}} slowly and cautiously with his fleet, wasting {{a great deal}} of time in rounding the Peloponnese. [...] Although he succeeded in giving the Athenians the slip and reaching Delos without being discovered, he reached Erythrae on the coast of Ionia a few days later only to learn that Mytilene had already fallen. [...] At this point the commander of the contingent from Elis advocated launching an attack on the Athenians at Mytilene, arguing that since they had only recently taken the city they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>off</b> their guard and vulnerable to a surprise attack. [...] Alcidas, however, was unwilling to attempt such a bold action, and also rejected a plan to seize some Ionian city as a base from which to foment rebellion in the empire. [...] Indeed, once he learned of Mytilene's surrender Alcidas's primary goal was to return home without having to confront the Athenian fleet, and he accordingly began sailing southwards down the Ionian coast. [...] Off Clarus he was spotted by the Athenian messenger ships Paralus and Salaminia, and the Athenian fleet set out from Mytilene to pursue him. [...] Alcidas, however, set out from Ephesus in full flight back to the Peloponnese, neither landing nor stopping until he was safely home, and thus escaped his pursuers. [...] After this, the Athenians returned to Lesbos and reduced the remaining rebellious cities there.|$|E
