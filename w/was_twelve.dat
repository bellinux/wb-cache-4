Aspinall and his mother returned to Liverpool later in 1942 after the bombing had subsided. Aspinall later attended West Derby School, where he passed his 11-Plus exams.

5|$|At {{the age of}} 29, Michael Johnson {{was engaged}} to be married to a local woman, Mary Neild, but she {{cancelled}} the engagement. Twenty years later, in 1706, he married Sarah Ford. She came from a middle-class milling and farming family and <b>was</b> <b>twelve</b> years his junior, daughter of Cornelius Ford. Although both families had money, Samuel Johnson often claimed that he grew up in poverty. It is uncertain what happened between the marriage of his parents and Samuel's birth three years later to provoke a decline in the family's fortunes, but Michael Johnson quickly became overwhelmed with debt from which he was never able to recover.|$|E

5|$|Graf saw {{his first}} {{aircraft}} when he <b>was</b> <b>twelve</b> years old. This sight created {{a conflict between}} his passion for football and a new obsession with flying. From 1930, {{he worked at the}} Engen town hall and saved all his money to buy a glider. Before his 20th birthday, he provided a homemade glider to the new Engen Sailplane Club. Every Sunday he would go out to the nearby Ballenberg mountain until a heavy crash destroyed his glider in the fall of 1932. In 1935, after Adolf Hitler officially revoked the Treaty of Versailles, Graf applied for flight training in the newly created Luftwaffe.|$|E

5|$|On 1 March 1953, Stalin {{suffered}} a massive stroke, apparently on rising after sleep.

As Khrushchev and other high officials stood weeping by Stalin's bedside, Beria raced from the room, shouting for his car.|$|E
5|$|Potemkin had no {{legitimate}} descendants, {{though it}} is probable he had illegitimate issue. Four of his five sisters {{lived long enough to}} bear children, but only the daughters of his sister Marfa Elena (sometimes rendered as 'Helen') received Potemkin's special attention. The five unmarried Engelhardt sisters arrived in court in 1775 on the direction of their recently widowed father Vassily. Legend suggests Potemkin soon seduced many of the girls, one of whom <b>was</b> <b>twelve</b> or thirteen at the time. An affair with the third eldest, Varvara, can be verified; after that had subsided, Potemkin formed close—and probably amorous—relationships successively with Alexandra, the second eldest, and Ekaterina, the fifth.|$|E

5|$|When Muñoz Rivera <b>was</b> <b>twelve</b> years old, {{his mother}} fell ill and died. By this time, {{the family had}} grown to include nine more siblings, whom he taught. By the age of fourteen, Muñoz Rivera was {{managing}} legal documents, working with the local church clergy, and helping in his father's store. There were no {{institutions of higher learning}} on the island at that time, and most families sent their children to Cuba (University of la Habana, founded in 1728), Spain or North America to complete their university education. Muñoz Rivera wanted to travel to Spain and study law, but his father wanted him {{to take care of the}} family's business.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the passing}} of the 1963 Act, the only {{exceptions}} to the normal statute of limitations (three years after the events that caused the injury, as established by the Law Reform (Limitation of Actions, etc.) Act 1954) were if the claim was being brought for a case of mistake or fraud, in which case the statute of limitations <b>was</b> <b>twelve</b> months from when the claimant could reasonably have been expected to discover the fraud or mistake. In Cartledge v E. Jopling & Sons Ltd the claimant sued Jopling after he developed pneumoconiosis from working in the company's poorly ventilated steel mills. The injuries were sustained in October 1950 but they were not discovered until 1956, and as a result the injured party had no cause of action. Because the injuries had not been discovered until six years after they were caused, and the statute of limitations was three years after the injury itself, Cartledge was not legally allowed to bring a case.|$|E
5|$|He was {{intended}} to have the name Joachim, but this was stopped on request from Joachim G. Giæver who voiced his dislike for the name.

In 1893, one year after the death of Koht's father, the family moved to Bekkelaget, a borough in Aker. Koht studied at the Royal Frederick University (now the University of Oslo).|$|E
