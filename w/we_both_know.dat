500|$|The {{episode is}} cited by Robert M. Arkin and Philip J. Mazzocco {{in their work}} [...] "Self-Esteem in Springfield", in the {{compilation}} book The Psychology of The Simpsons. Arkin and Mazzocco note an exchange between Edna Krabappel and Seymour Skinner, where Skinner exclaims to Krabappel: [...] "Oh come on Edna: <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> these kids have no future! [...] Prove me wrong, kids. Prove me wrong." [...] Arkin and Mazzocco note that this example {{is seen as an}} exception, writing: [...] "Generally, however, the Simpsons are right on target in their understanding of the importance of self-esteem and the dynamics involved in the interplay between the social world and positive self-regard." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} discussion {{about his relationship}} with Westfeldt, Hamm said: [...] "We may not have a piece of paper that says we're husband and wife, but after 10 years, Jennifer {{is more than just a}} girlfriend. What we have is much deeper and <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> that. To me, people get married when they're ready to have kids, which I'm not ruling out." [...] Along with Westfeldt, Hamm has appeared in Gap-related campaign advertisements. During April 2009, Hamm and Westfeldt formed their own production company, Points West Pictures. Hamm and Westfeldt are advocates of animal rescue and have adopted a mixed breed dog named Cora from the Much Love Animal Shelter in California.|$|E
2500|$|On July 6, 2017, Francesa and Russo {{attended}} the SiriusXM Town Hall meeting moderated by actor Chazz Palminteri, {{a week before}} a 30 for 30 documentary on Francesa and Russo went on the air. Regarding the possibility of reunions, Francesa says, [...] "“first, someone has to make an offer, which no one has yet. But if something comes up, I’ll always listen.” And Russo says, [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> we could easily do shows together. I {{think it would be}} sporadic — maybe one day a week, maybe something around big events." ...|$|E
5000|$|... 'Penny Lane' {{was kind}} of nostalgic, {{but it was really}} a place that John and I knew; it was {{actually}} a bus terminus. I’d get a bus to his house and I’d have to change at Penny Lane, or the same with him to me, so we often hung out at that terminus, like a roundabout. It was a place that <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew,</b> and so <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> the things that turned up in the story. - Paul McCartney, discussing [...] "Penny Lane" [...] in a 2009 interview with Clash magazine ...|$|R
500|$|... "It {{just seemed}} like a great adventure—{{something}} I wanted to do. Why? I'm not certain, other than <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> would be doing something that hadn't been done before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{perfectly}} certain," [...] Arnold declared, vigorously, [...] "that {{if there}} has been anything irregular in her uncle's life, Miss Lalonde knew nothing of it. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> that he talked wildly, but, for the rest, his doings have been as much a mystery to her as to me." ...|$|R
2500|$|Many of the {{executives}} {{involved in the}} botched transition and later changes subsequently left NBC. Zucker was fired by Comcast Executive Vice President Steve Burke, but stressed that the late-night conflict was not to blame, but rather Comcast's insistence to install their own team. Marc Graboff opted to leave his contract early that November, as did Gaspin. While O'Brien admitted in 2012 that he occasionally still felt resentment over the events that transpired, he noted that [...] "I had an amazing partnership with NBC and was very disappointed at the outcome, but I didn't feel entitled to Late Night or Tonight or to the TBS show. If you're in this business and haven't experienced profound pain at some point, you're not doing it right. I strongly believe that." [...] He has had no contact with Leno, noting [...] "the odds are we will both leave this Earth without speaking to each other, which is fine. There's really nothing to say. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> the deal. He knows; I know. I'd rather just forget." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bene Gesserit {{are trained}} in what they call [...] "the Voice" [...] a means [...] "to control others merely by {{selected}} tone shadings of the voice." [...] By modulating the subtleties of her voice, a Bene Gesserit can issue commands on a subconscious level, compelling obedience in others that they cannot resist, whether they are consciously aware of the attempt or not. This control can be as subtle as influencing thoughts and motivations, or as strong as forcing physical actions and even temporary paralysis in the subject. To effect this, the Bene Gesserit must [...] "register" [...] the intended target by analyzing his or her personality and vocal patterns through observation or seemingly innocuous direct questions. Training in the Voice is independent of the Reverend Mother ritual, so individuals outside the order may even be instructed in its use. Prior to Dune, Jessica has begun teaching it to Paul; after the Reverend Mother Mohiam tests him in the novel, she urges Jessica to [...] "ignore the regular order of training. His own safety requires the Voice. He already has a good start in it, but <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> how much more he needs ... and that desperately." [...] Jessica herself later notes of Paul's novice attempt: [...] "The tone, the timbre excellent – imperative, very sharp. A slightly lower pitch would have been better, but it could still fall within this man's spectrum." [...] The Voice may also be subtly employed in any manner of conversation, public speaking, or debate to help soothe, convince, persuade, influence, or otherwise enhance {{the effect of the}} words being spoken.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Because <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> we are ridiculous, my dear!’ Rosa {{gave that}} answer {{as if it}} were the most {{conclusive}} answer in the world.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{about your}} debts? Of course I couldn't pay debts which were always increasing. And of course your {{promises}} {{for the future}} were false. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> that they were false when they were made. Did we not?" [...] She paused for an answer, but he made none. [...] "They meant nothing; did they? He is dead now." ...|$|R
60|$|And over {{we went to}} the shipyard, where Charley led the way to the Mary Rebecca, lying {{hauled out}} on the ways, where she was being cleaned and overhauled. She was a scow-schooner <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> well, {{carrying}} a cargo of one hundred and forty tons and a spread of canvas greater than other schooner on the bay.|$|R
60|$|Oh, my dear, don't you {{see that}} things said can never be taken back. <b>We</b> may <b>both</b> <b>know</b> something....|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish {{to speak}} to you," [...] she began abruptly, [...] "about that young man <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> of. Have you seen {{anything}} of him lately?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't deceive {{us for a}} minute!" [...] she cried. [...] "Not for a second. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> that you've been enjoying {{yourself}} immensely. Hasn't he, Katharine?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not likely}} to forget that night," [...] he said. [...] "What I swore <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>know.</b> Well? I have begun to keep my word. You know that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Because, Madam, that night,' he continued, {{twitching}} {{her by the}} sleeve, 'it {{happens that}} <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> secrets which <b>we</b> didn't choose to tell, and <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> just the same professionally. And so the less you say about such things the better, Mrs. Snitchey; and take this {{as a warning to}} have wiser and more charitable eyes another time. Miss Marion, I brought a friend of yours along with me. Here! Mistress!' ...|$|R
60|$|She {{seemed to}} draw herself {{together}} inside her dress. Her eyes glittered. My mouth felt very dry, {{and my heart}} was beginning to thump. <b>We</b> were <b>both</b> furiously angry. It was a moment that had been coming for years, and <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> it. For my part I was glad that it had come. On subjects on which one feels deeply it is a relief to speak one's mind.|$|R
60|$|Your {{dear friend}} amused me and amused himself {{as long as}} it suited his inclinations; and then {{reminded}} me that <b>we</b> were <b>both</b> people of the world, that <b>we</b> <b>both</b> understood mankind, that <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> {{there was no such thing}} as romance, that <b>we</b> were <b>both</b> prepared for going different ways to seek our fortunes like people of sense, and that <b>we</b> <b>both</b> foresaw that whenever we encountered one another again we should meet as the best friends on earth. So he said, and I did not contradict him.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{cannot be}} helped, sir. Miss Baker {{can do nothing}} in the matter now; nor can any one else. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> that the {{marriage}} would not suit us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{no use for}} you to try {{to speak}} of what I have done in Brittany, when <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> that your heart is full of what I did in Poitou." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now when {{shall we}} fix the marriage?" [...] he said. [...] "It {{is no good}} putting it back. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> what we are doing. And now the {{engagement}} is announced--" ...|$|E
60|$|We didn't say a {{word for}} a good while. There warn't {{anything}} to say. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>knowed</b> well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnake-skin; {{so what was the}} use to talk about it? It would only look like we was finding fault, and that would be bound to fetch more bad luck--and keep on fetching it, too, till we knowed enough to keep still.|$|R
60|$|The Boy was black-haired, {{and so was}} the Major, luckily. I cut off a {{piece of}} the Major's hair above the temple with a knife, and put it into the packet we were making. The laughing-fit and the chokes got hold of me again, and I had to stop. The Major was nearly as bad; and <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> that the worst part of the work was to come.|$|R
40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 It {{had to be}} Miles, <b>we</b> <b>both</b> agreed to that. In fact, {{there had never been}} any argument. Actually, playing the record had not been the problem, only where and when. Now, all was in readiness. The low, barely discernable hum of the {{amplifier}} told us that it was warmed up and ready for action, and <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> {{that the rest of the}} components were, too. 2 ̆...|$|R
6000|$|Lawford's cheek turned more sallow than ever. 'You {{are only}} pretending {{to look for}} it,' he said, 'to try me. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> {{perfectly}} well the lock is broken. Ada broke it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, if you command it, Doctor, needs must;--but I {{can tell}} you there is a man <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>know,</b> that has a {{thousand}} reasons at least for keeping him in the public ward." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is.... Miss Joline, I {{feel like}} doing {{something}} I've wanted to do for some time. Of course <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> you {{think of me as}} 'that poor little dub, Mrs. What's-her-name, D. T.'s secretary--'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am so proud," [...] she was saying, [...] "that at last, {{after you}} have done so much for me, I can do a little thing for you. For it is {{something}} to free you, Tommy. You have always pretended, for my sake, {{that we could not}} do without each other, but <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> all the time that it was only I who was unable to do without you. You can't deny it." ...|$|R
60|$|Well {{might he}} be anxious, for as <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew,</b> {{no one in}} the {{neighbourhood}} had guns except ourselves, and all ours were accounted for. It is true that we had promised to give the majority of those we had taken from the slavers to Bausi when we went away, and that I had been instructing some of his best soldiers in the use of them, but not one of these had as yet been left in their possession.|$|R
5000|$|Meader {{had to take}} flying {{lessons and}} learn Morse code in able to become her husband's co-pilot, navigator, and radio operator. During training, {{she gave birth to}} her first son, Christopher. In an {{interview}} with Encore Magazine in 2006, when asked why she decided to take the journey, she replied: [...] "It just seemed like a great adventure - something I wanted to do. Why? I'm not certain, other than <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> would be doing something that hadn't been done before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I say not," [...] growled Jenssen. [...] "I've always let you boss things, Sven; but here's a {{case where}} what I say has got to go--because I'm right and you're wrong, and <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> {{too well}} what becometh us; {{but when you}} were casting about for a mate for my young mistress, I could not but think how men seek far, and {{overlook}} the jewel at their feet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Constance. But my {{discourse}} will {{be about}} my life at the East End of London, and what I have seen there. I shall talk not of ancient things but of the present--that sad present <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>know.</b> You can realise it all so vividly--it will be painful to you." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{there were}} {{reasons why we}} {{could not find a}} lock fit to send. The Boy was black-haired, and so was the Major, luckily. I cut off a piece of the Major's hair above the temple with a knife, and put it into the packet we were making. The laughing-fit and the chokes got hold of me again, and I had to stop. The Major was nearly as bad; and <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> that the worst part of the work was to come.|$|R
6000|$|... "Alex Radrivsky. <b>We</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> him. He {{disappeared}} {{about six}} o'clock. The sun {{had just come}} up. About noon Klaus and I had an hour relief. We crept off, away from the bunkers. No one was watching. We came here. There {{used to be a}} town here, a few houses, a street. This cellar was part of a big farmhouse. We knew Tasso would be here, hiding down in her little place. We had come here before. Others from the bunkers came here. Today happened to be our turn." ...|$|R
5000|$|Boyd {{was first}} married in 1958 to Italian-born MCA {{executive}} Mariella Di Sarzana {{during the filming}} of Ben-Hur. They separated after just three weeks. Concerning his short-lived marriage to Sarzana, Boyd would explain, [...] "It was my fault. I'm an Irish so-and-so when I'm working. I hadn't been married a week when <b>we</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> had made a mistake. She is a nice girl but we were just not meant for each other. I suppose I wasn't ready for marriage. Maybe I was still {{too much of an}} adolescent." [...] They officially divorced in early 1959.|$|R
