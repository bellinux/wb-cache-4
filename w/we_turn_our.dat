[...] Academics of a given nationality deal with some problems more often [...] When <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>our</b> attention to Polish sociological theories, one cannot fail to notice ... that they were evoked by other needs and other problems that a different theoretical answer than in Western science" [...] — Jan Stanisław Bystroń, 1917 ...|$|E
2500|$|Each {{object is}} a [...] "mirror of all others." [...] Our {{perception}} of the object through all perspectives is not that of a propositional, or clearly delineated, perception; rather, it is an ambiguous perception founded upon the body's primordial involvement {{and understanding of the}} world and of the meanings that constitute the landscape's perceptual [...] Only after we have been integrated within the environment so as to perceive objects as such can <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>our</b> attention toward particular objects within the landscape so as to define them more clearly. This attention, however, does not operate by clarifying what is already seen, but by constructing a new Gestalt oriented toward a particular object. Because our bodily involvement with things is always provisional and indeterminate, we encounter meaningful things in a unified though ever open-ended world.|$|E
2500|$|The backstory {{of one of}} the {{surviving}} epistles, directed to Constantine I, recounts how the fame of Saint Anthony spread abroad and reached Emperor Constantine. The Emperor wrote to him offering praise and requesting prayers. The brethren were pleased with the Emperor's letter, but Anthony did not pay any attention to it, and he said to them, [...] "The books of God, the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords, commands us every day, but we do not heed what they tell us, and <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>our</b> backs on them." [...] Under the persistence of the brethren who told him [...] "Emperor Constantine loves the church", he accepted to write him a letter blessing him, and praying for the peace and safety of the empire and the church.|$|E

2500|$|Cultural {{ecologist}} and philosopher David Abram articulates and elaborates {{an intensely}} ethical and ecological form of animism {{grounded in the}} phenomenology of sensory experience. In his books Becoming Animal and The Spell of the Sensuous, Abram suggests that material things are never entirely passive in our direct experience, holding rather that perceived things actively [...] "solicit our attention" [...] or [...] "call our focus," [...] coaxing the perceiving body into an ongoing participation with those things. In the absence of intervening technologies, sensory experience is inherently animistic, disclosing a material field that is animate and self-organizing from the get-go. Drawing upon contemporary cognitive and natural science, as well as upon the perspectival worldviews of diverse indigenous, oral cultures, Abram proposes a richly pluralist and story-based cosmology, in which matter is alive through and through. Such an ontology is in close accord, he suggests, with our spontaneous perceptual experience; it would draw us back to our senses and to {{the primacy of the}} sensuous terrain, [...] enjoining a more respectful and ethical relation to the more-than-human community of animals, plants, soils, mountains, waters and weather-patterns that materially sustains us. [...] In contrast to a long-standing tendency in the Western social sciences, which commonly provide rational explanations of animistic experience, Abram develops an animistic account of reason itself. He holds that civilized reason is sustained only by an intensely animistic participation between human beings and their own written signs. Indeed, as soon as <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>our</b> gaze toward the alphabetic letters written on a page or a screen, these letters speak to us—we 'see what they say'—much as ancient trees and gushing streams and lichen-encrusted boulders once spoke to our oral ancestors. Hence reading is an intensely concentrated form of animism, one that effectively eclipses all of the other, older, more spontaneous forms of participation in which we once engaged. [...] "To tell the story in this manner—to provide an animistic account of reason, {{rather than the other way}} around—is to imply that animism is the wider and more inclusive term, and that oral, mimetic modes of experience still underlie, and support, all our literate and technological modes of reflection. When reflection's rootedness in such bodily, participatory modes of experience is entirely unacknowledged or unconscious, reflective reason becomes dysfunctional, unintentionally destroying the corporeal, sensuous world that sustains it." ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{really do}} not know how we should ever have got home, had we been left to our own devices. We were cold with fright.

60|$|The {{apartment}} {{in which the}} Saxon chiefs were confined, for to them <b>we</b> <b>turn</b> <b>our</b> first attention, although at present used {{as a sort of}} guard-room, had formerly been the great hall of the castle. It was now abandoned to meaner purposes, because the present lord, among other additions to the convenience, security, and beauty of his baronial residence, had erected a new and noble hall, whose vaulted roof was supported by lighter and more elegant pillars, and fitted up with that higher degree of ornament, which the Normans had already introduced into architecture.|$|E

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>turn</b> <b>our</b> {{attention}} to the left-hand characteristics; which were flatness in respect of the river, verticality in respect of the wall behind it, and darkness as to both. These features made up the mass. If anything could be darker than the sky, it was the wall, and if any thing could be gloomier than the wall it was the river beneath. The indistinct summit of the facade was notched and pronged by chimneys here and there, and upon its face were faintly signified the oblong shapes of windows, though only in the upper part. Below, down to the water's edge, the flat was unbroken by hole or projection.|$|E

60|$|Darkness {{came down}} upon the deep. And in the gloom <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> <b>our</b> prows towards the many-twinkling quays, far in the distance.
