2500|$|In 1913, Henri Poincaré posthumous Last Essays were {{published}} {{and there he}} had restated his position: [...] "Today some physicists <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>adopt</b> a new convention.

Addressing the question if a new convention of space and time is needed he wrote in 1912: [...] "Shall we be obliged to modify our conclusions? Certainly not; we had adopted a convention because it seemed convenient and we had said that nothing could constrain us to abandon it. Today some physicists <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>adopt</b> a new convention. It is not that they are constrained to do so; they consider this new convention more convenient; that is all.

2500|$|PV2 Frank [...] "Dim" [...] Dumphy (Luke Macfarlane) — [...] {{in spite}} of (or, more likely, in {{reaction}} against) his well-to-do upbringing and Ivy League education, this 22-year-old Cornell graduate deliberately chose a blue-collar, lower-class lifestyle. He was tormented by intellectual conflicts over the actions he is ordered to carry out, and maddened with worry over his pregnant, alcoholic wife and emotionally disturbed 7-year-old stepson. He has never pursued a commission {{because he does not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>adopt</b> a leadership role. [...] His perspective serves as a contrast to emphasize the truly underprivileged roots of his squad mates. Probably the most sensitive character in the series, he was deeply disturbed when he learned that a particular insurgent sacrificed several men and a little girl in order to get past a check point. He lacked a degree of street smarts which [...] "Smoke" [...] possessed as he has shown on some occasions, and does not operate prudently under pressure.
