5|$|Besides {{being one}} of the oldest {{surviving}} examples of Spanish architecture in California, the house gained much prominence by association with Helen Hunt Jackson's <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> 1884 novel Ramona. The Casa de Estudillo is one of three National Historic Landmarks in Southern California that were closely tied to Ramona, a novel of Californio life shortly after the American acquisition of California; the other two are Rancho Camulos and Rancho Guajome.|$|E
5|$|The Custer Trail, {{named for}} General George Armstrong Custer, {{was created in}} 1917 along a series of roads between Grand Rapids and Ft. Wayne, Indiana that {{included}} the modern M-37. Custer commanded the Michigan Cavalry Bridge during the Civil War, and he was <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> in the state after the war. The road {{that bears his name}} never achieved that level of popularity. By 1930, the name had already fallen out of use.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels was {{involved}} in planning the staging of the 1936 Summer Olympics, held in Berlin. It was around this time that he met and started {{having an affair with}} the actress Lída Baarová, whom he continued to see until 1938. A major project in 1937 was the Degenerate Art Exhibition, organised by Goebbels, which ran in Munich from July to November. The exhibition proved <b>wildly</b> <b>popular,</b> attracting over two million visitors. A degenerate music exhibition took place the following year. Meanwhile, Goebbels was disappointed by the lack of quality in the National Socialist artwork, films, and literature.|$|E
5|$|The {{daughter}} of a book salesman and homemaker, O'Neill was raised in rural Nebraska. She exhibited interest in the arts at an early age, and sought a career as an illustrator in New York City at age fifteen. Her Kewpie cartoons, which made their debut in a 1909 issue of Ladies' Home Journal, were later manufactured as bisque dolls in 1912 by J. D. Kestner, a German toy company, followed by composition material and celluloid versions. The dolls were <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> {{in the early twentieth}} century, and are considered {{to be one of the}} first mass-marketed toys in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Hardcore, punk, and garage rock {{were the}} roots of {{alternative}} rock, a diverse grouping of rock subgenres that were explicitly opposed to mainstream music, and that arose from the punk and post-punk styles. In the United States, many cities developed local alternative rock scenes, including Minneapolis and Seattle. Seattle's local scene produced grunge music, a dark and brooding style inspired by hardcore, psychedelia, and alternative rock. With {{the addition of a}} more melodic element to the sound of bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains, grunge became <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> across the United States in 1991. Three years later, bands like Green Day, The Offspring, Rancid, Bad Religion, and NOFX hit the mainstream (with their respective then-new albums Dookie, Smash, Let's Go, Stranger than Fiction and Punk in Drublic) and brought the California punk scene exposure worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In 1695 Parliament {{failed to}} renew the Licensing Acts, and as a result, the press were free to print {{material}} attacking the government. Although there were eight attempts to force a new Licensing Act through Parliament between 1697 and 1713, none of them succeeded. Despite {{the freedom of the}} press from censorship by the government, the judiciary held a different view; it regularly tried people for seditious libel if they printed material attacking the government. From 21 November 1768, letters written by a man under the pseudonym of Junius were published in the Public Advertiser, a London newspaper run by Henry Sampson Woodfall. In them, Junius attacked many political leaders, including Lord Granby and Mansfield. As his letters were <b>wildly</b> <b>popular,</b> the circulation of the Public Advertiser doubled in just five months.|$|E
5|$|On February 4, 2014, Steve Ballmer {{stepped down}} as CEO of Microsoft and was succeeded by Satya Nadella, who {{previously}} led Microsoft's Cloud and Enterprise division. On the same day, John W. Thompson took {{on the role of}} chairman, with Bill Gates stepping down from the position, while continuing to participate as a technology advisor. On April 25, 2014, Microsoft acquired Nokia Devices and Services for $7.2 billion. The new subsidiary was renamed Microsoft Mobile Oy. In May 2016, the company announced it will lay off 1,850 workers, taking an impairment and restructuring charge of $950 million. During the previous summer of 2015 the company wrote down $7.6 billion related to its mobile-phone business and fired 7,800 employees from those operations. On September 15, 2014, Microsoft acquired the video game development company Mojang, best known for its <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> flagship game Minecraft, for $2.5 billion.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, {{stand-up}} comedian Ron Bennington joined Ron Diaz {{to create}} a <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> and raunchy morning radio program, The Ron & Ron Show at Tampa Bay's WYNF-FM, known as 95YNF.|$|E
25|$|Ensembles {{featuring}} {{the colors of}} Africa (green, yellow and red) became <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> among African Americans, as did kente cloth. In the urban hip-hop communities, sneakers were usually worn unlaced and with {{a large amount of}} gold jewelry, as well as head wraps.|$|E
25|$|Rikishi briefly feuded with Viscera before {{forming a}} <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> {{alliance}} with the duo Too Cool (Grand Master Sexay and Scotty 2 Hotty). One night, during Too Cool's traditional post-match dance routine, Rikishi joined them. As the dance routines became more frequent and longer, this popularity translated to a significant push. In the 2000 Royal Rumble match, he eliminated seven opponents, and it took six wrestlers working together to eliminate him.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} exponent of avant-garde art, Cocteau {{had great}} {{influence on the}} work of others, including a group of composers known as Les six. In the early twenties, he and other members of Les six frequented a <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> bar named Le Boeuf sur le Toit, a name that Cocteau himself had a hand in picking. The popularity was due in no small measure to the presence of Cocteau and his friends.|$|E
25|$|The Dr. Oldsmobile {{theme was}} one of Oldsmobile's most {{successful}} marketing campaigns in the early '70s, it involved fictional characters created to promote the <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> 442 muscle car. 'Dr. Oldsmobile' was a tall lean professor type who wore a white lab coat. His assistants included 'Elephant Engine Ernie' who represented the big block 455 Rocket engine. 'Shifty Sidney' was a character who could be seen swiftly shifting his hand using a Hurst shifter.|$|E
25|$|The {{trend has}} {{continued}} {{to the present day}} with modern nightclubs worldwide regularly playing electronic dance music (EDM). Today, electronic dance music has radio stations, websites, and publications like Mixmag dedicated solely to the genre. Moreover, the genre has found commercial and cultural significance in the United States and North America, thanks to the <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> big room house/EDM sound that has been incorporated into U.S. pop music and the rise of large-scale commercial raves such as Electric Daisy Carnival, Tomorrowland (festival) and Ultra Music Festival.|$|E
25|$|The {{video game}} market {{experienced}} {{a period of}} rapid growth and unprecedented popularity in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Consoles such as the Atari 2600 and the Intellivision proved to be <b>wildly</b> <b>popular,</b> and many third-party developers arose in their wake to exploit the growing industry. Nintendo was one such development studio, and, by 1982 had found success {{with a number of}} arcade games, such as Donkey Kong, which was in turn ported to, and packaged with the ColecoVision console in North America.|$|E
25|$|Between 1961 and 1975, Gaidai {{directed}} {{a number of}} top-selling movies, each one a huge financial success and becoming <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> in the Soviet Union. During these years, he filmed new adventures of the mischievous trio in The Bootleggers (1961), a film adaptation of O. Henry's short stories, Business People (1962), Operation Y and Other Shurik's Adventures (1965), and Kidnapping, Caucasian Style (1966). Following his break with Morgunov, Gaidai disbanded the trio, while casting Nikulin in {{what was to become}} the most popular Soviet comedy ever made, The Diamond Arm (1968).|$|E
25|$|Originally, dikir barat {{was limited}} to {{competition}} between neighbouring villages, but in the 20th century, as its popularity began to spread (aided by the ability to record performances), it became a national phenomenon. Today, dikir barat competitions have become <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> across Malaysia, and each year there are national champions crowned, {{not only for the}} dikir barat groups as a whole, but there also are national champion in the categories of tukang karuts and tok juara. Top tukang karuts are famous and popular, much like rock stars in the West.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, author Sax Rohmer {{published}} {{a series of}} novels focusing on the <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> Chinese villain, Dr. Fu Manchu. Attempting to capitalize on this success, DC Comics and Marvel Comics both published comic books featuring Chinese villains physically resembling Fu Manchu and possessing the same personality, sexual ambiguity, and ambitions for world domination. Because neither publisher possessed a license for the Fu Manchu character, these early Chinese comic book villains were either unnamed or had a different name than Fu Manchu. Examples include DC's Red Dragon and Marvel's Yellow Claw and The Mandarin.|$|E
25|$|Pink films became <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> in {{the mid-1960s}} and {{dominated}} the Japanese domestic cinema through the mid-1980s. In the 1960s, the pink films were largely the product of small, independent studios. Around 1970, the major studio Nikkatsu started focusing almost exclusively on erotic content, but another major Toei started producing a line of {{what came to be}} known as Pinky Violence films. With their access to higher production values and talent, some of these films became critical and popular successes. Though the appearance of the adult video led viewers to move away from pink film in the 1980s, films in this genre are still being produced.|$|E
25|$|In New York City, jazz was fused with stride (an {{advanced}} form of ragtime) {{and became}} highly evolved, {{notably in the}} compositions of James P. Johnson in the 1920s. Fletcher Henderson's jazz orchestra, first appearing in 1923 and including Coleman Hawkins (and later New Orleans musician Louis Armstrong) became <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> and helped invent swing music. Though Henderson {{was among the first}} major New York jazz musicians, he was not as able to adapt to the rapidly changing style as some of his contemporaries, such as Duke Ellington. When Ellington moved to New York City, he inaugurated a legion of jazz musicians that did the same and moved the center of jazz's development from Chicago to New York.|$|E
25|$|From the beginning, the new firm {{published}} {{a wide array}} of books and pamphlets. In 1841, for instance, its presses turned out Merciful Rebukes: A Sermon Preached in the Rutgers Street Church, New York, on Friday, May 14, 1841, On Occasion of the National Fast Recommended by the President of the United States. Two years later, the firm {{published a}} more ambitious project: a four-volume set of the sermons and papers of Rev. Jonathan Edwards entitled The Works of President Edwards, in Four Volumes. The firm, with the experienced Trow in command of the printing end, also published the classical series of Prof. John J. Owen, which was <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> and went through several printings.|$|E
25|$|Red Sox General Manager Theo Epstein {{shook up}} {{the team at}} the MLB trading {{deadline}} July 31, trading the team's <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> yet often hurt and disgruntled shortstop, Nomar Garciaparra, to the Chicago Cubs, receiving Orlando Cabrera from the Montreal Expos and Doug Mientkiewicz from the Minnesota Twins in return. In a separate transaction, the Red Sox also traded AAA outfielder Henri Stanley to the Los Angeles Dodgers for center fielder Dave Roberts. With valuable players like Cabrera, Mientkiewicz, and Roberts in the line up, the club turned things around, winning twenty-two out of twenty-five games and going on to finish within three games of the Yankees in the AL East and qualifying for the playoffs as the AL Wild Card.|$|E
25|$|MSX {{never became}} the {{worldwide}} standard that its makers had envisioned, mainly because it never {{took off in}} the U.S. and the UK. Before MSX's lack of success in these markets became apparent, US manufacturer Commodore Business Machines overhauled its product line in the early 1980s and introduced models such as the Plus/4 and Commodore 16 that were intended to better compete with the features of MSX computers. However, in Japan, South Korea, Argentina, and Brazil, MSX was the paramount home computer system of the 1980s. It was also quite popular in continental Europe, especially in the Netherlands and Spain. Classrooms full of networked Yamaha MSX were used for teaching informatics in school in some Arab countries, the Soviet Union, and Cuba, where they were <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> in all government education schools and centers.|$|E
25|$|A true professional, {{she would}} spend months {{preparing}} the new character types {{she wanted to}} represent on stage. These roles had a slightly mocking edge, furthering her popularity among the working class men in her audience. She was <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> among women as well, who viewed her {{as a symbol of}} independence. Newspaper reports of her performances emphasised how popular she was throughout the country, drawing capacity crowds in England, Scotland, Ireland, the Isle of Man and Wales. Often, people were turned away from the theatre as all space, including standing room, had been allocated. In some cases, theatre proprietors were able to ('obliged to' in their parlance) raise ticket prices for her week-run in their theatre. As at the time ticket prices were set regardless of the performers arriving that week, Tilley's ability to sell out even when prices were raised indicates her immense popularity.|$|E
25|$|Hawkins {{was part}} of a more general shift by African Americans away from the Republican and towards the Democratic Party. Unlike the {{majority}} of African Americans, he supported Franklin D. Roosevelt's campaign for president in 1932. Hawkins favored measures such as the New Deal, which was <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> in the United States at large and the African American community in particular. Roosevelt would go on to be the first Democratic president to win the black vote, in 1936. In 1934, Hawkins supported the more controversial 1934 California gubernatorial election of Upton Sinclair, a socialist. Although Sinclair lost, Hawkins defeated Republican Frederick Madison Roberts, the great-grandson of Sally Hemings and President Thomas Jefferson and the first African American in the California State Assembly. Hawkins would serve as a Democratic member of the Assembly from 1935 until 1963, by the time of his departure being the most senior member, like Roberts before him.|$|E
500|$|In 1964, {{there was}} a severe {{shortage}} of coins. [...] Silver prices were rising, and the public responded by hoarding not only the <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> new coin, the Kennedy half dollar, but the other denominations, including the non-silver cent and nickel. [...] Hopeful that issuing more 1964-dated coins would counter the speculation in them, the Treasury obtained Congressional authorization to continue striking 1964-dated coins into 1965.|$|E
500|$|The Trouser Press Guide to '90s Rock {{called the}} album a [...] "surly milkshake of broken rock shards... from the artistic {{misspellings}} of song titles to the lyric collage {{on the inner}} sleeve and the abrasive, abstract guitar noises on the songs, Pretty on the Inside reveals the band's fascination with the New York no wave art and music scene of the '80s." [...] According to Billboard, the album had sold 27,000 copies by 1994, when the band released their <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> follow-up album, Live Through This.|$|E
500|$|Hitler's {{belief that}} abstract, Dadaist, expressionist and modern art were decadent {{became the basis}} for policy. Many art museum {{directors}} lost their posts in 1933 and were replaced by party members. Some 6,500 modern works of art were removed from museums and replaced with works chosen by a Nazi jury. Exhibitions of the rejected pieces, under titles such as [...] "Decadence in Art", were launched in sixteen different cities by 1935. The Degenerate Art Exhibition, organised by Goebbels, ran in Munich from July to November 1937. The exhibition proved <b>wildly</b> <b>popular,</b> attracting over two million visitors.|$|E
500|$|In 1860, Milton Bradley {{developed}} {{a radically different}} concept of success in The Checkered Game of Life, the first American board game rewarding players for worldly ventures such as attending college, being elected to Congress, and getting rich. Virtue became {{a means to an}} end rather than an end in itself. [...] Daily life was the focus of the game with secular virtues such as thrift, ambition, and neatness receiving more emphasis than religious virtues. Indeed, the only suggestion of religion in Bradley's game was the marriage altar. [...] The Checkered Game of Life was <b>wildly</b> <b>popular,</b> selling 40,000 copies in its first year.|$|E
500|$|Detzner's {{book was}} <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> {{among the general}} {{population}} for its incredible tales of stubborn patriotism and its narratives describing the exotic locales of the lost imperial colonies. [...] His descriptions touched a chord in the German imagination: {{one of their own}} had explored the colony, walked its paths, seen its mountains and valleys, and met its people. His vivid descriptions brought to life the images Germans had seen on postcards (such as the one to left), newspapers, and in school books. Furthermore, he had defended Germany's [...] "place in the sun" [...] when others had failed to do so. His book was translated into English, Finnish, Swedish and eventually French. (See below.) ...|$|E
500|$|It was fashionable {{for women}} to be full-figured (or plump). Men enjoyed the {{presence}} of assertive, active women. The foreign horse-riding sport of polo from Persia became a <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> trend amongst the Chinese elite, and women often played the sport (as glazed earthenware figurines from the time period portray). The preferred hairstyle for women was to bunch their hair up like [...] "an elaborate edifice above the forehead", while affluent ladies wore extravagant head ornaments, combs, pearl necklaces, face powders, and perfumes. A law was passed in 671 which attempted to force women to wear hats with veils again {{in order to promote}} decency, but these laws were ignored as some women started wearing caps and even no hats at all, as well as men's riding clothes and boots, and tight-sleeved bodices.|$|E
500|$|Jack Sheppard (4 March 1702 – 16 November 1724) was {{a notorious}} English thief and gaol-breaker of early 18th-century London. Born into a poor family, he was apprenticed as a {{carpenter}} but took to theft and burglary in 1723, {{with little more}} than a year of his training to complete. [...] He was arrested and imprisoned five times in 1724 but escaped four times from prison, making him a notorious public figure, and <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> with the poorer classes. [...] Ultimately, he was caught, convicted, and hanged at Tyburn, ending his brief criminal career after less than two years. [...] The inability of the notorious [...] "Thief-Taker General" [...] Jonathan Wild to control Sheppard, and injuries suffered by Wild at the hands of Sheppard's colleague, Joseph [...] "Blueskin" [...] Blake, led to Wild's downfall.|$|E
500|$|In 1901, as Lear explains, a Potter {{family friend}} and {{sometime}} poet, Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley, set Potter's tale into [...] "rather dreadful didactic verse and submitted it, along with Potter's illustrations and half her revised manuscript, to Frederick Warne & Co.," [...] {{who had been}} among the original rejecters. Warne editors declined Rawnsley's version [...] "but asked to see the complete Potter manuscript" [...] – their interest stimulated by the opportunity The Tale of Peter Rabbit offered the publisher {{to compete with the}} success of Helen Bannerman's <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> Little Black Sambo and other small-format children's books then on the market. When Warne inquired about the lack of colour illustrations in the book, Potter replied that rabbit-brown and green were not good subjects for colouration. Warne declined the book but left open the possibility of future publication.|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} acclaim surrounding the album also helped to shift {{attention away from}} the melodious, synth-driven, and funk-induced G-funk subgenre, which dominated the charts for some time after Dr. Dre's The Chronic (1992). Citing the example of Snoop Dogg's <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> Doggystyle (released six months prior to Nas' debut) author Matthew Gasteier writes, [...] "The first thing immediately noticeable about the [...] review, is that, like essentially every other review about Illmatic in publications like Vibe, Spin, Rolling Stones, and The New York Times, it mentions Snoop Doggy Dogg's Doggystyle in the first paragraph." [...] That nearly every reviewer felt the need to contextualize their response to Illmatic within the frame of West Coast G-Funk [...] "is a reminder of just how pervasive the style was within the hip hop world and the music community as a whole." ...|$|E
500|$|Hip-hop social dancing (party dancing) {{began when}} hip-hop musical artists started to release songs with an {{accompanying}} dance. In 1990, rapper MC Hammer created the Hammer dance and popularized {{it in his}} music video [...] "U Can't Touch This". The Hammer dance was a social dance that became <b>wildly</b> <b>popular</b> and then faded as the album it was associated with, Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em, lost popularity. Most social dances are short-lived fad dances, some are line dances, and others spawn new dance styles that stay relevant even after {{the life of the}} songs they came from come to an end. The development of hip-hop social dancing extends further back than the 1990s with the Charleston, a jazz dance; Chubby Checker's Twist, which was considered rock & roll; several 1970s fad dances made popular by James Brown; and the influence of the television show Soul Train.|$|E
500|$|During a roadtrip to Houston, {{later in}} the season, Smith met a {{part-time}} usherette at the Astrodome named Denise while making {{his way to the}} team bus outside the stadium. The couple developed a relationship that was sometimes long-distance in nature, and eventually decided to marry. [...] It was also during the 1978 season that Smith introduced a signature move. Padres promotion director Andy Strasberg knew Smith could perform backflips, but that he only did them during practice before fans entered the stadium. Strasberg asked Smith to do a backflip for fans during Fan Appreciation Day on October 1, the Padres' last home game of the season. After conferring with veteran teammate Gene Tenace, Smith went ahead with the backflip, and it proved to be <b>wildly</b> <b>popular.</b> Smith finished the 1978 season with a [...]258 batting average and [...]970 fielding percentage, placing second in National League Rookie of the Year voting to Bob Horner.|$|E
500|$|During the Civil War, when {{soldiers}} {{from across the}} country commingled, the multifarious strands of American music began to cross-fertilize each other, a process that was aided by the burgeoning railroad industry and other technological developments that made travel and communication easier. Army units included individuals {{from across the country}}, and they rapidly traded tunes, instruments and techniques. The war was an impetus for the creation of distinctly American songs that became and remained <b>wildly</b> <b>popular.</b> The most popular songs of the Civil War era included [...] "Dixie", written by Daniel Decatur Emmett. The song, originally titled [...] "Dixie's Land", was made for the closing of a minstrel show; it spread to New Orleans first, where it was published and became [...] "one of the great song successes of the pre-Civil War period". In addition to popular patriotic songs, the Civil War era also produced a great body of brass band pieces.|$|E
