5|$|Superstition in the {{northeast}} (Maine and New Brunswick) relates how woodsmen would not harm gorbeys as they believed that whatever they inflicted on the bird would be done to them. A folk tale circulated {{about a man who}} plucked a gorbey of its feathers and later <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> next morning having lost all his hair. Although the story was widespread in the early to mid-20th century, it {{does not appear to have}} been extant in 1902.|$|E
5|$|For a subplot, Chaplin first {{considered}} a character even {{lower on the}} social scale, a black newsboy. Eventually he opted for a drunken millionaire, a character previously used in the 1921 short The Idle Class. The millionaire plot {{was based on an}} old idea Chaplin had for a short in which two millionaires pick up the Little Tramp from the city dump and show him a good time in expensive clubs before dropping him back off at the dump, so when he <b>woke</b> <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> Tramp would not know if it was real or a dream. This was rewritten into a millionaire who is a friend of the Tramp when drunk but does not recognize him when sober.|$|E

25|$|The Dodgers {{returned}} home on Memorial Day and Ryu took a perfect game into the 8th inning against the Cincinnati Reds before allowing a lead-off double to Todd Frazier. The bullpen again struggled, and the Reds {{closed the gap}} before the Dodgers held on to win 4–3. Andre Ethier homered, tripled and drove in four runs in the 6–3 win over the Reds on the 27th as Grienke struck out 11 in his 7⅔ innings. Brandon Phillips hit a two-run homer in the 1st inning and the Reds held on to defeat the Dodgers 3–2 as the series wrapped up. They lost again the next day, 6–3, to the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Dodgers were shut down by Francisco Liriano in a 2–1 loss the following day. Hanley Ramírez <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Dodgers offense by going 4 for 4 with 2 homers and 5 RBI as the Dodgers routed the Pirates 12–2 to finish the month of May with a 15–15 record.|$|E

25|$|The final {{match on}} the undercard {{was for the}} NWA United States Heavyweight Championship. Barry Windham defended the title against Dusty Rhodes. Rhodes {{dominated}} Windham in the beginning by performing a Shoulder Block. Rhodes continued to perform several moves on Windham until the action spilled {{to the outside of}} the ring where Windham tried to perform a Piledriver on Rhodes but Rhodes countered it with a Clothesline. The action returned to the ring where Rhodes fought Windham until Windham's manager JJ Dillon distracted Rhodes, allowing Windham to take advantage and attack Rhodes. Windham applied a Clawhold on Rhodes and started getting near-falls. Rhodes eventually fought out of the Clawhold and tried to apply a Figure Four Leglock but Windham countered and applied another Clawhold. Rhodes eventually climbed the corner to prevent Windham for getting the leverage and tried to perform a Superplex but Rhodes pushed him into the referee. Rhodes performed a Bionic Elbow on Windham and attempted to pin him but the referee was knocked out. Ron Garvin interfered in the match and attacked Rhodes with a Punch. Dillon <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> referee and Windham pinned Rhodes to retain the title.|$|E
25|$|The Phillies were 36-45 and 11 {{games behind}} {{the first place}} Nationals after their series against the Marlins. The Phillies started the month by taking 1 of 3 from the New York Mets. The one win, however, came with Cliff Lee finally winning his {{first game of the}} season after 13 starts. The streak tied for 5th for the longest winless streak for a pitcher. The Phillies would end the first half by getting swept by the Atlanta Braves. They ended the first half with a {{disastrous}} 37–50 mark, their worst since 1997. The Phillies seemed to have woken up in the second half, as they would take 2 of 3 from the Colorado Rockies and Los Angeles Dodgers. Although they only took 1 of 3 from the San Francisco Giants, they would make it up by sweeping the Milwaukee Brewers, all from late comebacks. The sweep was their first 3-game sweep of the year. The sweep, however, got taken back by the Braves as they would get swept by them again because they had a hard time with runners in scoring position. The sweep <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Phillies, as they would blow out the Washington Nationals in the 1st game of the series on July 31, 8–0. The Phillies would end up taking 2 of 3 from the Nationals. After the series against the Nationals on August 2, the Phillies were 47–58, 15 and a half games behind the first place Nationals, and 13 game behind the second wild card. Although their playoff chances are slim, the Phillies performance after the all-star break looked promising for next season. Throughout the month, knowing that they will likely not make the post-season, the Phillies made trades with some of their players. One of the trades were Hunter Pence getting traded to the Giants for Nate Schierholtz, Tommy Joseph, and Seth Rosin. Another trade was Shane Victorino getting trading to the Dodgers for 2 pitchers. Pitcher Joe Blanton also got involved in a trade with the Dodgers. The Phillies would also resign Cole Hamels to a six-year, $144 million extension, the second-largest contract for a pitcher in baseball history.|$|E

[...] Rogers's story eventually got 32.8 million unique visitors. Meanwhile, when Conway <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> next morning, his inbox had so many emails about the dress that at first, he thought his email had been hacked, until he saw that the bulk were interview requests from major media organisations.

500|$|Adams {{decided to}} focus on the game's {{development}} full-time during his first year of his math post-doctorate at Texas A in 2006. The university offered him $50,000 if he would stay another year. Adams agreed and commented on this, [...] "I <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> morning after I gave notice, like, I can actually make this work." [...] Later, Adams expected he would use his $15,000 savings for a year and then have to get a job in order to support himself because the game had not been released yet. Development continued till 8 August 2006, when the first alpha version (version 0.21.93.19a) was released. Donations reached $800–$1000 in the following months, this average increased gradually until they were financially stable. He then decided to solely rely on donations.|$|E

500|$|Until Vojislav's {{death in}} December 1363, the Serbian nobles in the Greek lands showed {{themselves}} more ambitious, as they held more titles and greater independence (deriving from their more extensive possessions, and therefore, wealth) {{in relation to}} the nobility of the old Serbian lands. While Vojislav lived, his influence secured the preeminence of the old Serbian nobility. After Vojislav's death, Vukašin Mrnjavčević, who had previously served Emperor Dušan as a župan (count, holder of a župa, a [...] "county" [...] or [...] "district") of Prilep, quickly gained a decisive influence on Emperor Uroš V. The nobility in the old Serbian lands was not at first alarmed at this, but Vukašin's ambition and his subsequent power moves <b>woke</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> simmering antagonism between the two groups. It was not only Vukašin's endless ambition that led to his success, as he had plenty of support from other nobles who benefited from him.|$|E

Sepinwall wrote that the [...] "only way the strangulation scene would have been acceptable to me was with the understanding going in that it was a dream.

[...] One writer for Paste Magazine noted that the [...] "brilliantly shot" [...] episode had a [...] "Hitchcockian feel", and pointed to the use of [...] "reverse point-of-view shots" [...] and [...] "close-ups of hands on doorknobs that added an air of suspense not usually present on Mad Men." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN declared it the [...] "best episode yet for Season 5, with some very good material for Joan, Peggy, Don and Sally packed into a busy hour." [...] Goldman praised the resolution to the Harris marriage, crediting Weiner with mastering [...] "the slow burn on this show, and it was just so gratifying to finally have this issue be dealt with." ...|$|E
