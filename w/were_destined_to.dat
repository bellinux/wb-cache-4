5|$|Given {{the strong}} {{resistance}} {{exhibited by the}} Chinese, the Canadians expected a tough fight as 25th Brigade prepared to assault its objectives {{as part of the}} second phase of the divisional plan. Yet with the loss of Hill 355 and 210 the Chinese unexpectedly withdrew from their well-prepared defensive positions, with Hill 159 and 175 captured without opposition. Only the 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry encountered any opposition before they captured the two Hill 187 features, losing one killed and six wounded during stiff fighting in which 28 Chinese were also killed. Indeed, the ease with which the Canadians had captured their initial objectives allowed them to press on, attaining their final objectives on the Jamestown Line by nightfall. No further resistance was encountered, although heavy Chinese artillery fire caused a number of casualties, including three killed. The Canadians subsequently occupied the positions they <b>were</b> <b>destined</b> <b>to</b> hold for the next twenty-two months of fighting.|$|E
5|$|Tracking the Joker to the Gotham Royal Hotel, Batman {{discovers that}} the villain {{and his men}} have filled the hotel with explosives, murdered the staff, and taken the guests hostage. The Joker berates the assassins for their failure to kill Batman, {{throwing}} Electrocutioner out a window to his death: Batman recovers his electric gloves. The assassins leave, except for Bane, who thinks Batman is coming for the Joker. After traversing the building, Batman finds the Joker on the roof but is forced to battle Bane. Thinking Batman is outmatched, Alfred alerts the police so they will intervene. As Bane escapes by helicopter, he fires a rocket at the Joker, who is thrown from the hotel by the concussive force. Batman saves the Joker, leaving him with the police. Puzzled by the events, the Joker is imprisoned in Blackgate {{under the care of}} Dr. Harleen Quinzel; he tells Quinzel that he and Batman <b>were</b> <b>destined</b> <b>to</b> meet.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} Yellow Turban Rebellion {{also occurred}} in 184 CE, its leaders {{claiming that they}} <b>were</b> <b>destined</b> <b>to</b> bring about a utopian era of peace. Like the Five Pecks of Rice society, the Yellow Turbans of the Huai and Yellow River valleys also believed that illness {{was a sign of}} wrongdoing that necessitated confession to church leaders and faith healers. However, the Yellow Turbans typically utilized holy water as a ramification for sickness; if this did not cure the sick, the latter's sins were deemed too great to be exculpated. Since the year 184 CE was the first (and very auspicious) year of a new sexagenary cycle, the Yellow Turban's supreme leader Zhang Jue (d. 184 CE) chose the third month of that year as the time to rebel; when this was leaked to the Han court, Zhang was forced to initiate the rebellion prematurely. Although the Yellow Turbans were able to muster hundreds of thousands of troops, they were overpowered by the combined force of imperial troops and independent generals. By {{the end of the year}} their leadership—including Zhang Jue—had been killed and only scattered groups remained until they were amalgamated into the forces of Cao Cao in 192 CE.|$|E

5|$|For {{reasons of}} security, Sturmabteilung Koch was {{dispersed}} around several {{locations in the}} Rhineland until it received orders for the operation against Fort Eben-Emael and the three bridges to begin. Preliminary orders were received on 9 May, ordering the separated detachments {{to move to a}} pre-arranged concentration area, and shortly afterwards a second order arrived, informing the assault force that Fall Gelb was to begin at 05:25 on 10 May. At 04:30, forty-two gliders carrying the 493 airborne troops that formed the assault force were lifted off from two airfields in Cologne, the armada of gliders and transport aircraft turning south towards their objectives. The aircraft maintained strict radio silence, forcing the pilots to rely on a chain of signal fires that pointed towards Belgium; the radio silence also ensured that senior commanders of the assault force could not be informed that the tow-ropes on one of the gliders had snapped, forcing the glider to land inside Germany. The pilot of a second glider released his tow-rope prematurely, and was unable to land near its objective. Both gliders were carrying troops assigned to Group Granite and <b>were</b> <b>destined</b> <b>to</b> assault Fort Eben-Emael, thereby leaving the group understrength; it also left it under the command of Oberleutnant Witzig's second-in-command, as Witzig was in one of the gliders forced to land. The remaining gliders were released from their tow-ropes twenty miles away from their objectives at an altitude of , which was deemed high enough for the gliders to land by the three bridges and on top of the fort, and also maintain a steep dive angle to further ensure they landed correctly. After the Ju-52's released the gliders and began turning away, Belgian anti-aircraft artillery positions detected them and opened fire. This alerted the defences in the area to the presence of the gliders.|$|E

25|$|Also in August 1961, 120 picked {{candidates}} began {{training as}} 12 man Special Operating Teams in Hua Hin, Thailand.

25|$|Livonia {{in the far}} {{northeast}} {{was incorporated}} by Poland in 1561 and Poland entered the Livonian War against Russia. The executionist movement (an attempt to prevent domination by the magnate families of Poland and Lithuania) peaked at the Sejm in Piotrków in 1562–63. On the religious front, the Polish Brethren split from the Calvinists, and the Protestant Brest Bible was published in 1563. The Jesuits, who arrived in 1564, <b>were</b> <b>destined</b> <b>to</b> make {{a major impact on}} Poland's history.|$|E
25|$|Tomé de Sousa, first Governor General of Brazil, {{brought the}} first group of Jesuits to the colony. More than any other {{religious}} order, the Jesuits represented the spiritual side of the enterprise and <b>were</b> <b>destined</b> <b>to</b> {{play a central role in}} the colonial history of Brazil. The spreading of the Catholic faith was an important justification for the Portuguese conquests, and the Jesuits were officially supported by the King, who instructed Tomé de Sousa to give them all the support needed to Christianise the indigenous people.|$|E

25|$|The first {{operational}} {{service of}} the F-102A was with the 327th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at George Air Force Base, in April 1956, and eventually a total of 889 F-102As were built, production ending in September 1958. TF-102s and F-102s {{were used in the}} 1960s by the Air Defense Command (ADC) at Perrin AFB, Texas to train new F-102 pilots.

25|$|Alsogaray's {{tenure at}} Environment Secretariat, which was {{elevated}} to a cabinet-level post {{by the president}} in 1991, was also marked {{by a number of}} scandals. These included bid rigging for the refurbishment of the Haedo Palace (the secretariart's headquarters) and, particularly, of a 1993 plan to decontaminate the Riachuelo (a heavily polluted waterway along Buenos Aires' industrial southside). Alsogaray obtained a US$250 million loan from the IADB for the purpose; of this, however, US$150 million <b>were</b> <b>destined</b> <b>to</b> unrelated social projects, six million were lost in IADB fines, US$90 million were never allocated, and only one million was used for the actual cleanup.|$|E

25|$|Concerned {{about the}} effect of the continual {{maternal}} criticism on Victoria's psychological health, Baron von Stockmar asked Prince Albert to intervene and ask the Queen to moderate her demands. However, the Baron was unable to reduce the attacks that the princess suffered from the Russophilic and Anglophobic circles of the Berlin court. For most of the 19th century, Russia and Britain were not just geopolitical rivals in Asia, but also ideological opponents as many in both nations believed autocratic Russia and democratic Britain <b>were</b> <b>destined</b> <b>to</b> battle each for world domination. In Prussia, the Junkers tended to see much in common with the ordered society of Imperial Russia, and disliked British democracy. She was often hurt by unkind comments from the Hohenzollern family.|$|E

Peskett's original configuration for the ships in 1902 was a three-funnel design, when reciprocating engines <b>were</b> <b>destined</b> <b>to</b> be the powerplant. A giant model of the ships appeared in Shipbuilder's magazine in this configuration; however, Cunard decided to change power plants to Parson's new turbine technology, and the ship's design was again modified when Peskett added a fourth funnel to the ship's profile. Construction of the vessel finally began with the laying of the keel in August 1904.|$|E
