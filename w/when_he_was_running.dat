The negative ad backfired, as The Scranton Times-Tribune found that {{all but a few}} of Casey's contributors donated <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> for other offices, and none were investigated for anything. In fact, two of the persons cited in Santorum's campaign ad actually gave contributions to Santorum in 2006, and one died in 2004. Santorum's campaign countered that those donations were not kept, and had been donated to educational institutions.|$|E

[...] Despite this, other interviews with Lennon report him as being loyal to Epstein's memory: [...] "We had complete faith in him <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> us.

Her first name was taken from her uncle Thomas Hogg's epic Civil War poem The Fate of Marvin, which featured two young women named Ima and Leila.

500|$|Following {{the release}} of Rainbow, Carey left Sony and signed an $80 million, four-album {{contract}} with EMI's Virgin Records, wishing to severe all ties with Sony and its chairman, her former husband Tommy Mottola. Halperin and Hampp believe that following a prolonged period of absence from Sony and re-signing with them is a positive situation for Carey: [...] "Doug Morris, current chairman/CEO of Sony Music, brought Carey to Island Def Jam in 2003 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> Universal Music Group. Reid, then head of Island Def Jam, oversaw her Mimi-powered 2005 comeback. Joey Arbagey, a collaborator of Carey's during {{the making of the}} six-times platinum The Emancipation of Mimi, is now executive vp A at Epic." [...] Furthermore, Carey released seven studio albums, a live EP and four compilation/greatest hits albums with Sony, which have sold a total of 54 million units in the US combined. Although Halperin and Hampp note that [...] "Carey's legacy is undisputed, her recent stumbles have not gone unnoticed," [...] with regard to her divorce from Nick Cannon, the low sales of Me. I Am Mariah… The Elusive Chanteuse and its failure to garner a top-ten single on the Billboard Hot 100 and hiring and firing three managers: Dupri, Randy Jackson and Kevin Giles (the last of whom Carey has kept as a consultant). As a result, several record labels were reluctant to offer Carey a contract. According to Billboard, many other critics felt that reuniting with Reid is Carey's best chance of re-establishing herself on the charts.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2008, {{it became}} public that Olmert {{was the subject}} of another police investigation, {{concerning}} allegations of bribery. Olmert said that he took campaign contributions from Jewish-American businessman Morris Talansky <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> for mayor of Jerusalem, leadership of the Likud and candidacy in the Likud list for the Knesset. It was alleged that Olmert unlawfully received millions of shekels in illegal campaign funding from Talansky over a 15-year period. Olmert resisted calls to resign, and stated: [...] "I never took bribes, I never took a penny for myself. I was elected by you, citizens of Israel, to be the Prime Minister and I don't intend to shirk this responsibility. If Attorney General Meni Mazuz, decides to file an indictment, I will resign from my position, even though the law does not oblige me to do so." [...] On 2 May, head of the National Fraud Investigations Unit Brigadier-General Shlomi Ayalon and two investigatiors questioned Olmert for 90 minutes in his Jerusalem residence. On 23 May, National Fraud Investigations Unit officers interrogated Olmert for an hour in his Jerusalem residence. On 27 May, Talansky testified in court that over the last 15 years he gave Olmert more than $150,000 in cash in envelopes to fund political campaigns, and hinted that Olmert also used the money for fine hotels, cigars, pens and watches. On 6 September 2008, the Israel Police recommended that criminal charges should be brought against Olmert. In their indictment, prosecutors claimed that Olmert had received some $600,000 from Talansky in either cash or bank transfers, and that $350,000 of this was held in a [...] "secret cache" [...] managed by Olmert's close associate Uri Messer. The prosecution also claimed that Olmert used his official capacity as minister of trade and industry to facilitate introductions with hotel managers for Talansky, a partner in a firm providing mini-bars for hotels. It was alleged that Olmert sometimes used official letterheads. The charge sheet said that Olmert was aware he was in an [...] "acute conflict of interest".|$|E

6000|$|And {{in passing}} {{we note that}} that {{historic}} phrase, the Iron Heel, originated in Ernest Everhard's mind. This, we may say, is the one moot question that this new-found document clears up. Previous to this, the earliest-known use of the phrase occurred in the pamphlet, [...] "Ye Slaves," [...] written by George Milford and published in December, 1912. This George Milford was an obscure agitator about whom nothing is known, save the one additional bit of information gained from the Manuscript, which mentions that {{he was shot in}} the Chicago Commune. Evidently he had heard Ernest Everhard make use of the phrase in some public speech, most probably <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> for Congress in the fall of 1912. From the Manuscript we learn that Everhard used the phrase at a private dinner in the spring of 1912. This is, without discussion, the earliest-known occasion on which the Oligarchy was so designated.|$|E

It was wonderful how in the grim and strict Puritanical household he could have imbibed so much fairy lore, but he must have eagerly assimilated and recollected whatever he heard, holding them as tidings from his true kith and kin; and, indeed, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>running</b> on thus, Mrs. Woodford sometimes felt a certain awe and chill, as of the preternatural, and could hardly believe that he belonged to ordinary human nature.
