5|$|Alberta's second dynasty <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Farmers of Alberta, a farmers' {{movement}} organization, {{formed in}} 1909 as a lobby group, whose political wing rose from a minor party named the Alberta Non-Partisan League, formed in 1916. Henry Wise Wood led the {{party at the}} time of the 1921 election, although he did not run himself. The loosely organized farmer candidates running in rural constituencies captured a majority of the seats. The party was allied with Labour candidates, so it did not contest urban ridings, aside from one in Edmonton. Wood did not want the job as premier so the farmers were forced to shop around. UFA lawyer John Brownlee was asked first but declined. UFA executive member Herbert Greenfield, the second choice, became the new premier, although he too had not run in the election so had to await success in a by-election to take his seat.|$|E

5|$|In September 2013, the UN had {{peacekeeping}} soldiers deployed on 15 missions. The largest <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), {{which included}} 20,688 uniformed personnel. The smallest, United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP), included 42 uniformed personnel responsible for monitoring the ceasefire in Jammu and Kashmir. UN peacekeepers with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) have been {{stationed in the}} Middle East since 1948, the longest-running active peacekeeping mission.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1793, war and {{internal}} disorder had combined with poor weather to leave France facing starvation following {{the collapse of the}} harvest. France's ongoing conflict with her neighbours precluded overland imports; the only nation willing and able to sell grain to the National Convention <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. Importing food from the Americas was a highly risky venture, as the British Royal Navy—at war with France since early 1793—patrolled much of the Atlantic passage. To provide effective protection for the vessels involved, a plan was agreed between France and the United States to collect the supplies over a period of months and transport them in a single convoy. A gathering point was arranged at Hampton Roads in the Chesapeake Bay.|$|E

5|$|Lethal {{injection}} is {{the practice}} of injecting one or more drugs into a person by a government {{for the express purpose}} of causing immediate death. While Nazi Germany was known to execute enemies of the state using an injection of lethal drugs, the first country to legalize and formally implement what is referred to today as lethal injection <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. The state of Texas adopted it as its form on capital punishment in 1977 and executed the first person by it, Charles Brooks Jr., in 1982. The practice was subsequently adopted by the other U.S. states using capital punishment. As of 2017, the method is being used by 31 U.S. states, as well as by their federal government and military.|$|E
5|$|Mireille Derebona-Ngaisset participated on the Central African Republic's behalf as a sprinter. She {{took part}} in the women's 800meters for the country, and was the only female Central African athlete at Beijing's Olympic games. Born in 1990, Derebona-Ngaisset was 18 {{years old at the time}} of her {{participation}} in the Beijing Olympics. The qualification round for the event took place on 14 August, where Derebona-Ngaisset took place in the sixth heat against six other athletes. She was, however, disqualified, and did not rank in the event. The leaders of Derebona-Ngaisset's heat included Kenya's Janeth Jepkosgei Busienei (1:59.72) and the Ukraine's Tetiana Petliuk (2:00.00). Of the 42 athletes participating in the event's qualification round, Mireille Derebona-Ngaisset was one of two athletes who did not finish (the other <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States' Nicole Teter) and the only one in the event to be disqualified that year.|$|E
5|$|On September 11, 2001, United Airlines Flight 93 was hijacked by {{four members}} of al-Qaeda {{as part of the}} September 11 attacks. The hijackers' {{specific}} target <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States Capitol. Among the pilots available that day of the 113th Wing of the DC Air National Guard were Lieutenant Colonel Marc H. Sasseville and Lieutenant Heather Penney Garcia. They were given the mission of finding the United Airlines Flight 93 and destroying it however they could. Since the fighter jets were absent of missiles and packed only with dummy ammunition from a recent training mission, {{there was only one way}} to do it and that was by ramming the aircraft. The fighter jets passed over the ravaged Pentagon building, however it was not until hours later that they would find out that United 93 had already gone down in a field outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing all 44 people aboard including the 4 hijackers.|$|E

5|$|Operation Eagle Pull <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States {{military}} evacuation by air of Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on 12 April 1975. At {{the beginning}} of April 1975, Phnom Penh, {{one of the last}} remaining strongholds of the Khmer Republic, was surrounded by the Khmer Rouge and totally dependent on aerial resupply through Pochentong Airport. With a Khmer Rouge victory imminent, the US government made contingency plans for the evacuation of US nationals and allied Cambodians by helicopter to ships in the Gulf of Thailand. Operation Eagle Pull took place on the morning of 12 April 1975 and was a tactical success carried out without any loss of life. Five days later the Khmer Republic collapsed and the Khmer Rouge occupied Phnom Penh.|$|E
5|$|Several {{government}} buildings in Alamogordo were {{constructed by the}} Works Progress Administration, a government program created in 1935 {{in response to the}} Great Depression. These include the Otero County Administration Building at 1101 New York Avenue, a Pueblo style building originally constructed as the main U.S. Post Office in 1938. The building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The main entrance portico features frescoes by Peter Hurd completed in 1942. The Post Office moved out in 1961, and the building was used by a succession of Federal agencies and was known as the Federal Building. The last Federal agency to occupy it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States Forest Service who used it as the headquarters of the Lincoln National Forest until October 2008, when that agency moved to a newly constructed building.|$|E
5|$|The RTV-A-2 Hiroc (high-altitude rocket) <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States' {{first attempt}} at an {{intercontinental}} ballistic missile (ICBM). The project was initially under the name MX-774, however the project was canceled in 1947, and leftover funds were used to build and launch three missiles, which were renamed to RTV-A-2 Hiroc. The design included several innovations; the gimballed engine provided guidance control, the internal gas pressure was used to support the airframe and the nose cap was separable. All of these concepts were later used on the Atlas missile.|$|E
