Once this sale happens they ultimately <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> the football club again.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of joining together {{with family and}} friends to share ownership of vacation property has been around for many years. But the fractional property industry started in the U.S. in the Rocky Mountains ski resorts in the early 1990s. These first fractional developments recognized that people did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> whole homes, which they would use only for a few weeks a year in the mountains. According to research firm Ragatz Associates there were over 250 fractional developments in North America in 2006 and fractional properties can now be found throughout the world.|$|E

25|$|In microeconomics, the Bertrand–Edgeworth {{model of}} price-setting {{oligopoly}} looks at {{what happens when}} there is a homogeneous product (i.e. consumers <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> from the cheapest seller) where {{there is a limit to}} the output of firms which they are willing and able to sell at a particular price. This differs from the Bertrand competition model where it is assumed that firms are willing and able to meet all demand. The limit to output can be considered as a physical capacity constraint which is the same at all prices (as in Edgeworth’s work), or to vary with price under other assumptions.|$|E

500|$|... "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] was sequenced as {{the final}} track on Revolver, which EMI's Parlophone label issued on 5 August 1966. In his design for the LP cover, Klaus Voormann drew {{inspiration}} from the song, recognising the need for artwork that would capture the Beatles' new direction and the avant-garde aspect of the recording. Voormann later said that he found [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] "frightening", adding that it was [...] "so {{far away from the}} early Beatles stuff that even I myself thought, well, the normal kind of Beatles fan won't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> this record.

500|$|The band {{also showed}} {{disappointment}} with the ten songs {{that emerged from}} the sessions, as Hawkins described the finished tracks as [...] "million-dollar demos", and Grohl considered the recordings [...] "far too clean, too tame and boring". The band only liked five of the ten songs, and thought that listeners would enjoy the other five anyway. Grohl was afraid to promote the album because of his lack of confidence in it. After manager John Silva listened to the recordings, he agreed {{that it was not a}} work that represented the band well, and that [...] "we can release it now, but I don't know if anyone would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> it".|$|E

Shea also included it on his list of the worst Virtual Console games, finding it difficult to imagine any reason why anyone would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> it. GameSpot's Frank Provo found that it became boring quickly, also criticizing the mathematics problems for being either too easy for young children or too boring for older ones. Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead commented that it gave him an [...] "ironic smile" [...] as a reminder of the NES era, though he could not justify paying five dollars for it.|$|E

500|$|The game itself {{includes}} a filter that players can activate with a password so that violent or sexually explicit content is censored. When the filter is in place, the screen blurs {{during the most}} violent sections, so the player can hear the action but cannot see it. Sierra officials believed {{it was the first}} CD-ROM adventure game that self-censored upon command. Sierra producer Mark Seibert said: [...] "There are some pretty gruesome things, and we're concerned about how that is going to impact parents who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> a good game with a good story line." [...] But Gene Emery of The Providence Journal said the censoring option was [...] "unlikely to stop any computer-literate 10-year-old" [...] and by scrambling portions of the videos that might be considered offensive, [...] "the censorship option actually makes the explicit scenes seem even worse than they really are".|$|E
500|$|Critics who {{disliked the}} album cited what they {{viewed as a}} ridiculous concept. Salon remarked in its review that [...] "Musically [...] their 1995 album Clouds Taste Metallic offers the same {{psychotic}} results without all the technological hassle. And conceptually? The same thing, just all at once: stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid." [...] Jason Josephes from Pitchfork awarded the album a score of 0.0 out of 10; in a scathing review, Josephes criticized the album for being inaccessible, asking [...] "Do I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> three more CD players with which to enjoy Zaireeka or, say, eat?" [...] and derided the band's fans. Further, in October 2009, editor-in-chief of Pitchfork, Mark Richardson, wrote a book titled Zaireeka for the 33 1/3 book series, published by Continuum International Publishing, now owned by Bloomsbury Publishing. In it, Richardson chronicles {{the creation of the}} album, praises it from multiple angles, and discusses the impact the album has had on music since its release. The album was included in Pitchforks 2010 list of [...] "ten unusual CD-era gimmicks".|$|E

Pretending to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> heroin, Dexter visits Freebo's house, where he sees Freebo's girlfriend Teegan Campbell (Jelly Howie). He returns to the house at night and finds Freebo fighting with another man (Nick Hermz). When the man attacks Dexter, Dexter stabs and kills him in self-defense. Dexter flees, shocked about breaking his father Harry's [...] "code" [...] and killing an innocent person. He is called to the scene the following day and discovers {{that the man was}} Oscar Prado, the brother of well-known assistant district attorney Miguel Prado. Miguel seeks an explanation and consolation from Dexter, and invites him to Oscar's wake. Dexter attends, leaving Debra alone on their dead father's birthday. He begins to question Harry's code and whether his loyalty is necessary.|$|E

After returning to the U.S., she spent her childhood in Nashville, Tennessee. Witherspoon was raised as an Episcopalian, and has said she is proud of the [...] "definitive Southern upbringing" [...] which she received. She said that it gave her [...] "a sense of family and tradition" [...] and taught her about [...] "being conscientious about people's feelings, being polite, being responsible and never taking for granted {{what you have in}} your life." [...] At the age of seven, Witherspoon was selected as a model for a florist's television advertisements, which motivated her to take acting lessons. At age eleven, she took first place in the Ten-State Talent Fair. Witherspoon received high grades in school, loved reading, and considered herself [...] "a big dork who read loads of books." [...] On mentioning her love for books, she said, [...] "I get crazy in a bookstore. It makes my heart beat hard because I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> everything." [...] She {{has been described as a}} [...] "multi-achiever" [...] and was given the nickname [...] "Little Type A" [...] by her parents.
