40|$|Weeds {{are really}} making {{disadvantages}} on corn (Zea mays L.). Since they compete to obtain light, water and nutrient. The competition may {{occur in the}} beginning until the harvesting time. The aims {{of this research is}} to determinate the critical periode of weed control on corn (Zea mays L.). The present study was conducted at exfarming field of corn, Tanjung Sari, Medan selayang. Variable factor being observed were plant height, initiation time of flower, dry weight of grain per sample, dry weight of grains per plot, weight of 100 corn grains, value harvesting indeks, height of weeds, dry weight of weeds and density of weeds. There were 12 treatments conducted, no weeds 2 <b>week</b> <b>after</b> planting : P 1, no weeds 4 <b>week</b> <b>after</b> planting : P 2, no weeds 6 <b>week</b> <b>after</b> planting : P 3, no weeds 8 <b>week</b> <b>after</b> planting : P 4, no weeds 10 <b>week</b> <b>after</b> planting : P 5, no weeds are found till the harvesting time : P 6, weedy until 2 <b>week</b> <b>after</b> planting : P 7, weedy until 4 <b>week</b> <b>after</b> planting : P 8, weedy until 6 <b>week</b> <b>after</b> planting : P 9, weedy until 8 <b>week</b> <b>after</b> planting : P 10, weedy until 10 <b>week</b> <b>after</b> planting : P 11, weedy until the harvesting time : P 12. The treatment were arranged in a randomized block design with three replication. The result showed that the weeding time for corn has non significantly affected to the plant height, dry weight of grains per sample, value harvesting indeks and dry weight of grains per plot, but significantly affected to the weight of 100 grain of corn. The filed of research was dominated by Eleusine indica. The critical periode of corn was happened of 21 day after planting up to 28 days after planting...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the best moment to stock trout, Salmo trutta L., larvae into the wild. This goal was accomplished by determining weekly changes in the growth parameters of larvae that were fed in seven variants: on the day of 2 / 3 yolk sac resorption; from the first <b>week</b> <b>after</b> the day of 2 / 3 yolk sac resorption; from the second <b>week</b> <b>after</b> the day of 2 / 3 yolk sac resorption; from the third <b>week</b> <b>after</b> the day of 2 / 3 yolk sac resorption; from the fourth <b>week</b> <b>after</b> the day of 2 / 3 yolk sac resorption; from the fifth <b>week</b> <b>after</b> the day of 2 / 3 yolk sac resorption; from the sixth <b>week</b> <b>after</b> the day of 2 / 3 yolk sac resorption. Based on our results, we concluded the following: 1) trout larvae are ready to start eating at the time of the resorption of 2 / 3 of the yolk sac; 2) trout larvae can live without food for three weeks following the resorption 2 / 3 of the yolk sac without any notable losses; 3) the best moment to stock trout larvae into the wild is in the period from the resorption of 2 / 3 of the yolk sac to the third <b>week</b> <b>after</b> this resorption, so one <b>week</b> <b>after</b> full resorption. This is the optimal period to stock any waters with trout larvae...|$|R

Eight experimental rat groups were, namely, a normal control, a primary infection control, a reinfection I (reinfection 7 <b>week</b> <b>after</b> treatment following 3 -week infection), a reinfection II (reinfection 2 <b>week</b> <b>after</b> treatment following 8 -week infection), a reinfection III (exploration of the intrahepatic bile ducts 1 <b>week</b> <b>after</b> reinfection 4 <b>week</b> <b>after</b> treatment following 4 -week infection), a superinfection, a secondary infection control, and an infection following immunization group. Sonographic and cholangiographic findings showed moderate or marked dilatation of the bile duct confluence in the primary infection control, reinfection II, and secondary infection control groups. Juvenile worms survived in the intrahepatic bile ducts 1 <b>week</b> <b>after</b> reinfection following treatment in the reinfection III group. It was concluded that reinfecting juvenile worms found during the first week following reinfection failed to survive or grow further.
