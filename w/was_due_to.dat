5|$|The Original All Blacks {{introduced}} several innovations to rugby in France and the British Isles. At {{the time}} of their tour many critics in the Northern Hemisphere blamed the use of the wing–forward for the All Blacks success. These critics claimed this player—who fed the ball into the scrum—would obstruct opposition players, and that the only reason they were not being penalised <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> poor refereeing. Their success however <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a combination of factors, the most important being the team's discipline and organisation, which was described at the time as a scientific approach.|$|E

5|$|The {{prosperity}} of the stockyards <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> both the concentration of railroads {{and the evolution of}} refrigerated railroad cars. Its decline <b>was</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> further advances in post-World War II transportation and distribution. Direct sales of livestock from breeders to packers, facilitated by advancement in interstate trucking, made it cheaper to slaughter animals where they were raised and excluded the intermediary stockyards. At first, the major meatpacking companies resisted change, but Swift and Armour both surrendered and vacated their plants in the Yards in the 1950s.|$|E
