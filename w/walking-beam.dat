You cut yourself adrift, from the only trustworthy climate in the world. I despise a land that has to waste half its time in watching the clouds. The Canton trip (I have been that way) introduces you to the American river steamer, which is not in the least like one of the Irrawaddy flotilla or an omnibus, as many people believe. It is composed almost entirely of white paint, sheet-lead, a cow-horn, and a <b>walking-beam,</b> and holds about as much cargo as a P. and O. The trade between Canton and Hong-Kong seems to be immense, and a steamer covers the ninety miles between port and port daily. None the less are the Chinese passengers daily put under hatches or its equivalent after they leave port, and daily is the stand of loaded Sniders in the cabin inspected and cleaned up. Daily, too, I should imagine, the captain of each boat tells his Globe-trotting passengers the venerable story of the looting of a river steamer--how two junks fouled her at a convenient bend in the river, while the native passengers on her rose and made things very lively for the crew, and ended by clearing out that steamer. The Chinese are a strange people! They had a difficulty at Hong-Kong not very long ago about photographing labour coolies, and in the excitement, which was considerable, a rickety old war junk got into position off the bund with the avowed intention of putting a three-pound shot through the windows of the firm who had suggested the photographing.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an optimum concept to design ‘‘road-friendly’ ’ vehicles with {{the recognition of}} pavement loads as a primary objective function of vehicle suspension design. A <b>walking-beam</b> suspension system is used as an illustrative example of vehicle model to demonstrate the concept and process of op-timization. The hypothesis of isotropy {{is applied to the}} measured one-dimensional road profile so that a two-dimensional random field model of pavement surface roughness can be achieved. Dynamic response of the <b>walking-beam</b> suspension system is obtained by means of stochastic process theory. Three commonly used objective of suspension optimum design, including ride quality, suspension stroke, and road adhesion, are briefly reviewed. The minimization of the probability of peak value of the tire load exceeding a given value is proposed as an objective function. Using the direct update method, optimization is carried out when tire loads is taken as the objective function of suspension design. The results show that tires with high air pressure and suspension systems with small damping will lead to large tire loads.

30|$|This article {{lays out}} a unified theory for {{dynamics}} of vehicle–pavement interaction under moving and stochastic loads. It covers three major {{aspects of the}} subject: pavement surface, tire–pavement contact forces, and response of continuum media under moving and stochastic vehicular loads. Under the subject of pavement surface, the spectrum of thermal joints is analyzed using Fourier analysis of periodic function. One-dimensional and two-dimensional random field models of pavement surface are discussed given three different assumptions. Under the subject of tire–pavement contact forces, a vehicle is modeled as a linear system. At a constant speed of travel, random field of pavement surface serves as a stationary stochastic process exciting vehicle vibration, which, in turn, generates contact force at the interface of tire and pavement. The contact forces are analyzed in the time domain and the frequency domains using random vibration theory. It is shown that the contact force can {{be treated as a}} nonzero mean stationary process with a normal distribution. Power spectral density of the contact force of a vehicle with <b>walking-beam</b> suspension is simulated as an illustration. Under the subject of response of continuum media under moving and stochastic vehicular loads, both time-domain and frequency-domain analyses are presented for analytic treatment of moving load problem. It is shown that stochastic response of linear continuum media subject to a moving stationary load is a nonstationary process. Such a nonstationary stochastic process can be converted to a stationary stochastic process in a follow-up moving coordinate.|$|E
40|$|This study {{involved}} characterizing the oxidation behaviour of {{low carbon steel}} in various gas mixtures of O$ rm sb 2, CO sb 2, H sb 2 O$ and N$ sb 2,$ at different oxidation temperatures. Rate measurements for the oxidation of the low carbon steel during reheating in a <b>walking-beam</b> steel reheat furnace were also carried out. Scaling rates during reheating were predicted from oxidation rates obtained in the laboratory. In-situ characterization of the phase compositions of the iron oxides, "scale", that form on low carbon steels during their oxidation at elevated temperatures was carried out using a neutron diffraction technique. Growths in the intensities of the diffraction peaks associated with characteristic crystal planes of the various oxides (Fe$ rm sb{x}$O, Fe$ rm sb 3 O sb 4 $ and Fe$ rm sb 2 O sb 3) $ were monitored on-line. The volume fractions of the oxides in the developing scale were calculated {{on the basis of}} ideal structure factors and measured relative intensities of diffraction peaks. Oxidation in binary gas mixtures of oxygen and nitrogen in the temperature range from 1000 to 1250 $ sp circ$C was carried out. Sample weight gain versus time data were analyzed, along with measurements and calculations of sample heating rates due to exothermic reactions at the sample surface. It was found that initial rates of oxidation depended on oxygen content in the gas mixture and that these rates were linear up to oxide thicknesses between 0. 4 and 0. 5 mm. The linear rates of oxidation were found to be controlled by the mass transport of oxygen from the gas phase, to the reaction surface, through a gas boundary layer. Subsequent oxidation rates followed a parabolic oxidation mechanism. Oxidation experiments were also carried out in binary, ternary and quaternary gas mixtures of O$ rm sb 2, CO sb 2, H sb 2 O$ and N$ sb 2 $ at various temperatures. Reaction rates during oxidation in binary gas mixtures of CO$ sb 2 $-N$ sb 2 $ and H$ sb 2 $O-N$ sb 2 $ followed a linear rate law and were found to be proportional to the partial pressures of CO$ sb 2 $ and H$ sb 2 $O in the gas mixtures. The oxidation rates showed a strong dependency on temperature. Oxidation in oxygen containing atmospheres showed that the main oxidizing agent was free O$ sb 2. $ Additions of CO$ sb 2 $ and H$ sb 2 $O had little effect on the magnitude of oxidation rates. Oxidation in these atmospheres exhibited an initial linear rate law which gradually transformed to a parabolic rate law. During reheating in a <b>walking-beam</b> steel reheat furnace, it was observed that scaling rates can be reduced by lowering input air/fuel ratios to the furnace, which resulted in lowering concentrations of free oxygen in the combustion products from about 3 % to about 1. 5 %. The predicted scaling rates during reheating using isothermal oxidation rate constants suggested that rates of oxidation during reheating in the industrial reheat furnace followed a combination of linear and parabolic rate laws, with the components of the linear oxidation rates being predominant. The observed reduction in scaling rates was a result of the decrease in the free oxygen within the furnace atmosphere...|$|E
