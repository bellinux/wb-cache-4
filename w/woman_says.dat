2500|$|Romance novelist Jaid Black (pseudonym for Tina Engler) {{said that}} [...] "many of my female readers enjoy rape fantasies, key word being fantasies. They {{certainly}} wouldn't {{want it to}} happen in real life, but enjoy the escapism and total lack of control provided by 'forced seduction' scenes in erotic romance novels". According to one reader of romance, women readers are quite capable of separating fantasy from reality: [...] "In real life {{there is no such thing}} as forced seduction. When a <b>woman</b> <b>says</b> no in real life, that means no, because in real life, rape is about violence and power. Rape in real life involves no pleasure for the woman". Alison Kent, author of the Complete Idiot's Guide to Writing Erotic Romance, says the theme is rare in modern romance novels; Linda Lee also cites scholarship to conclude that [...] "by the mid-1980s, the rape fantasy was rejected". However, forced seduction has been used as a plot point in post-1980s romance novels.|$|E
