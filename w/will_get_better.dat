In some cases, the vision <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>better</b> or worse during the day.|$|E

Over 90 per cent of consumers said FDI in retail will bring down prices and offer a wider choice of goods. Nearly 78 per cent of farmers said they <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>better</b> prices for their produce from multi-format stores. Over 75 per cent of the traders claimed their marketing resources will continue to be needed to push sales through multiple channels, but they may have to accept lower margins for greater volumes.|$|E
500|$|In 1928 Olivier {{created the}} role of Stanhope in R.C. Sherriff's Journey's End, in which he scored a great success at its single Sunday night premiere. He was offered the part in the West End {{production}} the following year, but turned it down in favour of the more glamorous role of Beau Geste in a stage adaptation of P. C. Wren's 1929 novel of the same name. Journey's End became a long-running success; Beau Geste failed. The Manchester Guardian commented, [...] "Mr.Laurence Olivier did his best as Beau, but he deserves and <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>better</b> parts. Mr.Olivier {{is going to make}} a big name for himself". For the rest of 1929 Olivier appeared in seven plays, all of which were short-lived. Billington ascribes this failure rate to poor choices by Olivier rather than mere bad luck.|$|E

The club wants revenge on Sebastian; Kurt says he should be expelled from Dalton, but Will asks them to let the system handle it. Artie (Kevin McHale) refuses: he is fed up with being told it <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>better</b> and says it should be better now, and leaves. Despite wanting revenge, Kurt is unwilling to use violence, so Santana goes to Dalton and accuses Sebastian of lying about {{the composition of the}} damaging slushie. He challenges her to a duel: the song [...] "Smooth Criminal". He admits after they finish that he rigged the slushie with rock salt, and hits her with an unadulterated one. Santana secretly recorded the encounter, and plays her evidence to New Directions, who in turn invite the Warblers to their auditorium, show them that they [...] "get" [...] Jackson better by performing [...] "Black or White", and reveal to the Warblers the proof that Sebastian deliberately tried to injure one of them.|$|E

2500|$|Destructoid's Chris Carter {{scored the}} game an 8 out of 10 {{and called it}} [...] "one of the biggest {{fighting}} games of 2015". Carter felt that as more characters are added via DLC, the game <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>better</b> over time. VideoGamer.com's Brett Phipps gave the game an 8/10 and called it [...] "absurd, gruesome ridiculous fun". Phipps mostly praised the story, character gameplay variety, and gore, but was annoyed by online [...] "hiccups". Nick Tan from Game Revolution commended the gameplay, particularly complimenting the character variations, environmental attacks, Brutalities, the Krypt, and the Tower system. Tan also liked the overall presentation and the story's concept, but missed Stage Fatalities and tag-team matches, disliked the story's ending, and felt that the game was purposefully [...] "truncated".|$|E
2500|$|Patients {{frequently}} show improvement {{even when}} given a sham or [...] "fake" [...] treatment. Such intentionally inert placebo treatments {{can take many}} forms, such as a pill containing only sugar, a surgery where nothing efficacious is actually done (just an incision and sometimes some minor touching or handling of the underlying structures), or a medical device (such as an ultrasound machine) that is not actually turned on. Also, due to the body's natural healing ability and statistical effects such as regression to the mean, many patients <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>better</b> even when given no treatment at all. Thus, the relevant question when assessing a treatment is not [...] "does the treatment work?" [...] but [...] "does the treatment work better than a placebo treatment, or no treatment at all?" [...] As one early clinical trial researcher wrote, [...] "the first object of a therapeutic trial is to discover whether the patients who receive the treatment under investigation are cured more rapidly, more completely or more frequently, {{than they would have}} been without it." [...] More broadly, the aim of a clinical trial is to determine what treatments, delivered in what circumstances, to which patients, in what conditions, are the most effective.|$|E
