She does not become the bride of the underworld, however; her bridal {{is to be in}} the upper world when she consents to meet Freyr at Barri." ...|$|E

He suggested that it might be accounted for by [...] "a false sensation or seeming experience" [...] (a velleity), which is associated with many of our actions when we perform them. On reflection, we realize that they were necessary and determined all along.|$|R

500|$|A {{series of}} levees on the park's eastern border marks {{the line between}} urban and {{protected}} areas, but development into these areas threatens the park system. Florida still attracts nearly a thousand new residents every day, and building residential, commercial and industrial zones near Everglades National Park stresses the water balance and ecosystems within the park. On the park's western border, Fort Myers, Naples and Cape Coral are expanding, but no system of levees exists to mark that border. National Geographic rated both Everglades National Park and Big Cypress National Preserve the lowest-scoring parks in North America, at 32 out of 100. Their scoring system rated 55parks in terms of sustainable tourism, destination quality, and park management. The experts who compiled the results justified the score by stating: [...] "Encroachment by housing and retail development has thrown the precious ecosystem into a tailspin, and if humankind doesn't back off, there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> left of one of this country's most amazing treasures".|$|E
500|$|Themistocles {{was born}} in Athens around 524BC, the son of Neocles, who was, {{in the words of}} Plutarch [...] "no very {{conspicuous}} man". His mother is more obscure; according to Plutarch, she was either a Thracian woman called Abrotonon, or Euterpe, a Carian from Halicarnassus. Like many contemporaries, little is known of his early years. Some authors report that he was unruly as a child and was consequently disowned by his father. Plutarch considers this to be false. Plutarch indicates that, on account of his mother's background, Themistocles was considered something of an outsider; furthermore the family appear to have lived in an immigrant district of Athens, Cynosarges, outside the city walls. However, in an early example of his cunning, Themistocles persuaded [...] "well-born" [...] children to exercise with him in Cynosarges, thus breaking down the distinction between [...] "alien and legitimate". Plutarch further reports that Themistocles was preoccupied, even as a child, with preparing for public life. His teacher is said to have told him: [...] "My boy, you <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> insignificant, but definitely something great, either for good or evil." ...|$|E
500|$|Warwick Castle {{had fallen}} into decay due to its age and neglect, and despite his remarks Dudley did not {{initiate}} any repairs to the castle. Queen Elizabeth I visited the castle in 1566 during {{a tour of the}} country, and again in 1572 for four nights. A timber building was erected in the castle for her to stay in, and Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick, left the castle to the Queen during her visits. When Ambrose Dudley died in 1590 the title of Earl of Warwick became extinct for the second time. A survey from 1590 recorded that the castle was still in a state of disrepair, noting that lead had been stolen from the roofs of some of the castle's buildings, including the chapel. In 1601 Sir Fulke Greville remarked that [...] "the little stone building there was, mightily in decay... so as in very short time there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> left but a name of Warwick". Greville was granted Warwick Castle by King James I in 1604.|$|E

500|$|The most {{dramatic}} deterioration has {{been caused by}} biological factors. It used to be thought that {{the depths of the}} ocean were a lifeless desert, but research carried out since the mid-1980s has found that the ocean floor is teeming with life and may rival the tropical rainforests for biodiversity. During the 1991 IMAX expedition, scientists were surprised by the variety of organisms that they found in and around Titanic. A total of 28 species were observed, including sea anemones, crabs, shrimp, starfish, and rattail fish up to a yard (1 m) long. Much larger creatures have been glimpsed by explorers. Some of Titanics fauna has never been seen anywhere else; James Cameron's 2001 expedition discovered a previously unknown type of sea cucumber, lavender with a glowing row of phosphorescent [...] "portholes" [...] along its side. A newly discovered species of rust-eating bacterium found on the ship has been named Halomonas titanicae, which has been found to cause rapid decay of the wreck. Henrietta Mann, who discovered the bacteria, has estimated that the Titanic will completely collapse possibly as soon as 2025. The Canadian geophysicist Steve Blasco has commented that the wreck [...] "has become an oasis, a thriving ecosystem sitting in a vast desert." [...] In mid 2016, using an imaging technique neutron radiation, the facilities of the Institut Laue-Langevin demonstrate that a molecule called ectoine is used by [...] Halomonas titanicae to survive the osmotic pressure that causes salt water on their membranes. Analysis by Henrietta Mann and Bhavleen Kaur, both of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in conjunction with other scientists and researchers of the University of Seville in Spain, has determined that the wreck of Titanic will not exist by 2037 and that preservation of Titanic is impossible. [...] "Unfortunately, because Titanic is 2.3 miles down, it is very difficult or impossible to preserve. It is film which will preserve it for history now," [...] says Mann. [...] "It has already lasted for 100 years, but eventually there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> left but a rust stain {{on the bottom of the}} Atlantic... I think Titanic has maybe 15 or 20 years left. I don't think it will have too much longer than that." [...] Other scientists have estimated that Titanic will last no longer than 14 years, as of 2017.|$|E

That person is so close to you that you are able to share some things only with him. For example, you can call that friend, and from the very first maniacal laugh or some other joke you will know who is {{at the other end of}} that line. We used to do that with him so often. And then when that person is gone, there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> like that in your life ever again." ...|$|E

2500|$|By {{the time}} of the trial at the Old Bailey there were 22 defendants, {{including}} three women. Neave denied the suggestion that there was indecent dancing at the club. Miss Carmen Fernandez, a professional dancer, called as an [...] "expert witness" [...] by the defence, stated that the Rumba and the Carioca might be thought indecent by those who saw {{them for the first time}} by that they were danced at well known West End halls. She was asked by the defence to demonstrate the Rumba in front of the dock but was prevented from doing so by judge Holman Gregory, who commented [...] "there <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> of the sort in this court." [...] On 25 October, three of the minor figures were acquitted, including the accordionist who said that he concentrated only on playing his instrument.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 April Savige gave Potts {{control of}} the central Bougainville sector. He {{immediately}} sent out patrols to sniff out Japanese. This put him at odds with Major George Winning, a former commando who had surveyed the whole island when Australian troops first arrived. Winning called Bougainville [...] "a self-supporting POW camp". [...] "To fight a war here and provoke hostilities <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> more than sinful destruction and wastage of bloody fine men who deserve to be laid off and sent home to their people". In Potts' view, taking a brigade trained to the peak of fitness and primed to attack and then giving them a garrison job, was actually more hazardous than sending them into battle. He had already lost one battalion commander in Bougainville, not in combat but {{in a plane crash}} while on a reconnaissance flight.|$|E

2500|$|Until Chamberlain's death, he and Wilhelm {{had what}} the American {{historian}} Geoffrey Field called [...] "a warm, personal bond", which was {{expressed in a}} series of [...] "....elaborate, wordy letters, full of mutual admiration and half-baked ideas". The Wilhelm-Chamberlain letters were full of [...] "the perplexing thought world of mystical and racist conservatism. They ranged far and wide in subject matter: the ennobling mission of the Germanic race, the corroding forces of Ultramontanism, materialism and the [...] "destructive poison" [...] of Judentum were favorite themes." [...] Other subjects often discussed in the Wilhelm-Chamberlain letters were the dangers posed to the Reich by the [...] "Yellow Peril", [...] "Tartarized Slavdom", and by the [...] "black hordes". In 1901, Wilhelm informed Chamberlain in a letter that: [...] "God sent your book to the German people, just as he sent you personally to me, that is my unshakably firm conviction". Wilhelm went on to praise Chamberlain as his [...] "comrade-in-arms and ally in the struggle for Teutons against Rome, Jerusalem, etc". In 1902, Wilhelm wrote another letter in which he told Chamberlain: [...] "May you save our German Volk, our Germanentum, for God has sent you as our helper!". Chamberlain in his turn advised Wilhelm to create [...] "a racially aware...centrally organised Germany with a clear sense of purpose, a Germany which would 'rule the world'". In 1903, Chamberlain wrote to Wilhelm to claim that as in the last decadent days of Rome, [...] "the civis britannicus is now become a purely political concept" [...] with no racial content being involved. Chamberlain wrote with disgust how for two shillings and a sixpence, [...] "every Basuto nigger" [...] could now carry a British passport. Chamberlain went on to predict within the next fifty years [...] "the English aristocracy <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>nothing</b> but a money oligarchy, without a shred of racial solidarity or relation to the throne". Chamberlain went on to deplore the practice of raising businessmen to the peerage in Britain, contemptuously declaring that in Britain mere [...] "brewers, ink manufacturers and ship-owners" [...] now sat in the House of Lords. Chamberlain ended his letter to the Kaiser by calling the general British public [...] "a herd which has no will and which a few newspapers and handful of politicians manipulate as they wish". Wilhelm's later concept of [...] "Juda-England", of a decaying Britain sucked dried by Jewish capitalists owed much to Chamberlain. The Dutch journalist Ian Buruma described Chamberlain's letters to the Kaiser as pushing his [...] "…Anglophobic, anti-Semitic, Germanophile ideas to the point of murderous lunacy". The liberal Berliner Zeitung newspaper complained in an editorial of the close friendship between Wilhelm II and such an outspoken racist and anti-Semite like Chamberlain, stating this was a real cause for concern for decent, caring people both inside and outside Germany.|$|E
