5|$|It {{is thought}} that {{the total amount of}} iridium in the planet Earth is much higher than that {{observed}} in crustal rocks, but as with other platinum-group metals, the high density and tendency of iridium to bond with iron caused most iridium to descend below the crust when the planet <b>was</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> still molten.|$|E

5|$|In an epilogue, Charlie is {{discovered}} {{by his parents}} in a catatonic state and does not show any movement despite being hit reluctantly by his father. After being admitted to a mental hospital, it is revealed that Helen actually sexually abused him when he <b>was</b> <b>young,</b> <b>and</b> his love for her (and empathy for her troubled youth) caused him to repress his traumatic memories. This psychological damage explains his flashbacks and derealization phases throughout the book. In two months Charlie is released, and Sam and Patrick visit him. In the epilogue, Sam, Patrick and Charlie go through the tunnel again and Charlie stands up and exclaims that he felt infinite.|$|E
5|$|Morales {{was born}} on 1 April 1865 in La Chimba, a barrio on the Mapocho River in Santiago de Chile, the {{daughter}} of carpenter Ventura Morales and Marta Infante. Her father died when she <b>was</b> <b>young,</b> <b>and</b> she moved with her mother to Valparaiso. There she started to learn her mother's trade as a seamstress until her mother married her to an older man in 1877, at age 11. Her husband died {{during the first year}} of their marriage, and her mother died about the same time.|$|E

5|$|On January 28, 1905, {{an article}} {{ran in the}} Indianapolis News {{containing}} information {{on the origin of}} the seal, some of it dubious. The article received much attention and started an informal inquiry into the history of the seal, and namely to discover if the sun in the seal was rising or setting. Jacob Piatt Dunn, the preeminent Indiana historian of the time, consulted several history and arrived at the conclusion that the sun was rising. Dunn cited the fact the state <b>was</b> <b>young,</b> <b>and</b> the mountains were to the east of the state, not the west—clearly indicating the sun was rising.|$|E
5|$|The Flames hired Cliff Fletcher, {{formerly}} of the St. Louis Blues, {{to serve as the}} team's general manager. Former Montreal Canadiens player Bernie Geoffrion was hired as the team's head coach. The team stocked its roster via an expansion draft held on June 6, 1972. Fletcher focused on goaltending, choosing Phil Myre with his first selection and rookie Dan Bouchard with his second. Fletcher drafted a competent roster, but one that <b>was</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> inexperienced. Two days later, the Flames selected Jacques Richard as the second overall pick in the 1972 NHL Amateur Draft.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{ends with}} the boys {{mourning}} at Kenny's grave and deciding {{to go home to}} eat candy as well as look at photos of Liane Cartman, who is on the cover of a porn magazine, much to the fury of Cartman claiming she <b>was</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> needed the money; Stan says the photos were taken a month ago, infuriating Cartman even more. Kenny returns as a zombie again, but a statue lands on him, followed by an airplane.|$|E

5|$|Very {{little is}} known for certain of the ancestry of the Godwins, {{the family of the}} last Anglo-Saxon King of England, HaroldII. When King Edward the Confessor died in January 1066 his closest {{relative}} was his great-nephew, Edgar the Ætheling, but he <b>was</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> lacked powerful supporters. Harold {{was the head of the}} most powerful family in England and Edward's brother-in-law, and he became king. In September 1066 Harold defeated and killed King Harald Hardrada of Norway at the Battle of Stamford Bridge, and Harold was himself defeated and killed the following month by William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings.|$|E
5|$|A pimp rapes Number 18 in a bar, then enslaves her sexually. Number 18's {{father died}} when she <b>was</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> her family {{struggled}} to support her thereafter. Strangers took her {{from her home in}} Cambodia as a child, replaced her name with a number, and prostituted her in various countries. Number 18 ends up in the Thai child prostitution industry. Most of her clients are rich men, many of them foreign tourists. In a brothel and bar called The Pearl, Number 18 is kept in a dark room containing only a table and a dilapidated bed. Whenever she fails to follow the orders of Mama, the brothel-keeper, Mama shouts at her and beats her. Number 18 prays for a man to come and save her from these ordeals. At the same time she becomes the most elegant and highly sought-after prostitute at The Pearl and her pimp's favourite. She becomes very proficient in pleasing men sexually but also remains childlike—she dries her face with her skirt and plays with its hem.|$|E
5|$|After Mary's death, Paul and Michael {{were sent}} to live with Jim's brother Joe, and his wife Joan, for two months, so as to let their father grieve in private. Jim {{depended}} heavily on his sisters, Jin and Millie, to help around the house. Jim later {{took part in the}} running of the household, as Cynthia Lennon remembered that when she and John Lennon used to visit Forthlin Road, Jim would often answer the door with his sleeves rolled up, a tea towel in his hand and an apron tied around his waist. When Paul later played at The Cavern during lunchtimes, Jim would drop off food there that Paul would later put in the oven at Forthlin Road. Ruth remembered that Jim was funny and musical with her, but also strict when she <b>was</b> <b>young,</b> <b>and</b> was insistent that she learned good table manners and etiquette when speaking to people.|$|E

5|$|In Matamoros and Brownsville, curanderos – {{practitioners}} of curanderismo – offered works {{of white and}} black magic. These services are known as brujería (witchcraft). People consult healers and fortune tellers for help with relationships: to revive their romance, to end a marriage, to make someone fall in love, or to hurt someone. People also consult them to drive away negative energy, predict the future and dangerous events, to improve their health, or to bring positive energy. Cisneros grew closer to curanderismo after her firstborn, David, died after being thrown from a moving vehicle by a friend {{while he was in}} St. Joe in 1974. People close to Cisneros described her as a person who endured several tragic events growing up. One of her uncles committed suicide when she <b>was</b> <b>young,</b> <b>and</b> her brother drowned as a teenager. But, several others who were close to her maintained that after her son died, Cisneros started to show signs of insanity, became more protective of her children, and began visiting local curanderas.|$|E
5|$|In {{his search}} for the lime, Scott discovers a strange, {{swirling}} cloud of dust that absorbs moisture. He follows it until he collapses {{in front of a}} lake bed. He has a brief hallucination where he engages in a spiritual conversation with a priest he knew on Earth. Meanwhile, the cloud moves up to him and condenses into water, waking him. Realizing what he's found, Scott shovels as much of the lime as possible into his bag and makes his way to the Gate. Greer, having set out to look for him, finds him along the way and helps carry the lime. Wallace sticks his arm into the wormhole to delay the countdown. The team returns with the lime successfully, which is used to repair the CO2 scrubbers. In the end, a recovering Scott tells Chloe that his parents and the priest died when he <b>was</b> <b>young,</b> <b>and</b> {{that the best way to}} deal with the grief is to keep moving forward. As everyone starts to breathe easier, a ship detaches itself from the Destiny.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that Charles Darwin might {{have suffered from}} Chagas disease {{as a result of}} a bite of the so-called great black bug of the Pampas (vinchuca) (see Charles Darwin's illness). The episode was reported by Darwin in his diaries of the Voyage of the Beagle as occurring in March 1835 to the east of the Andes near Mendoza. Darwin <b>was</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> generally in good health, though six months previously he had been ill for a month near Valparaiso, but in 1837, almost a year after he returned to England, he began to suffer intermittently from a strange group of symptoms, becoming incapacitated for much of the rest of his life. Attempts to test Darwin's remains at Westminster Abbey by using modern PCR techniques were met with a refusal by the Abbey's curator.|$|E

5|$|It {{is not yet}} {{understood}} why the universe has more matter than antimatter. It is generally assumed that when the universe <b>was</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> very hot it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons. However, observations suggest that the universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized {{to account for the}} asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the Sakharov conditions must be satisfied. These require that baryon number is not conserved, that C-symmetry and CP-symmetry are violated and that the universe depart from thermodynamic equilibrium. All these conditions occur in the Standard Model, but the effects are not strong enough to explain the present baryon asymmetry.|$|E
5|$|Mason {{was born}} in 1725, most likely {{in what is now}} Fairfax County, Virginia. His father died when he <b>was</b> <b>young,</b> <b>and</b> his mother managed the family estates until he came of age. He married in 1750, built Gunston Hall, and lived the life of a country squire, supervising his lands, family, and slaves. He briefly served in the House of Burgesses and {{involved}} himself in community affairs, sometimes serving with his neighbor George Washington. As tensions grew between Britain and the American colonies, Mason came to support the colonial side, and used his knowledge and experience to help the revolutionary cause, finding ways to work around the Stamp Act of 1765 and serving in the pro-independence Fourth Virginia Convention of 1775 and the Fifth Virginia Convention of 1776.|$|E
5|$|On May 23, 1994, Mexican State Judicial Police arrested Olivarez {{again in}} Matamoros for {{possessing}} two stolen vehicles. He {{was interviewed by}} Mexican authorities and stated {{that he was not}} guilty of Fischer's murder. He admitted to having stolen cars since he <b>was</b> <b>young,</b> <b>and</b> stated that Garza was trying to put the blame on him to protect himself from prosecution. Olivarez justified himself by saying that he had never been arrested with a gun. He admitted going to Dallas in 1992, but stated that he only knew Garza by name. He said he was a self-employed auto mechanic who supported his wife, mother, and uncle. Mexican officials said that Olivarez's auto theft ring extended all the way to Monterrey, as well as in Río Bravo, Valle Hermoso, and Matamoros, Tamaulipas. There was an arrest warrant for him issued by a state judge in Reynosa for being connected to about 50 car thefts. Brownsville investigators went to Mexico {{to see if they could}} talk to Olivarez, and began extradition procedings to bring him to a Texan court.|$|E
