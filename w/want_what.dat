25|$|Lynn Townsend was at {{odds with}} the Dodge Dealers and wanted to do {{something}} to please them. So in 1965 he asked me to come to his office - for the second time. He noted that one of the Dodge Dealer Council requests was for a Barracuda type vehicle. The overall dealer product recommendation theme was the same - we <b>want</b> <b>what</b> Plymouth has. The specific request for a Mustang type vehicle was not as controversial to Lynn. His direction to me was to give them a specialty car but he said 'for God's sake don't make it a derivative of the Barracuda': i.e. don't make it a Barracuda competitor.|$|E

He cabled Brigadeführer Edmund Veesenmayer of the SS on 20 July 1944 to ask about it, and was told on 22 July that Brand and Grosz {{had been sent to}} Turkey on the orders of Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS. Eichmann himself said during interrogation after the war that the order had come from Himmler, as did SS officer Kurt Becher: [...] "Himmler said to me: 'Take whatever you can from the Jews. Promise them whatever you <b>want.</b> <b>What</b> we will keep is another matter.'" ...|$|E
500|$|A socialist {{from his}} {{undergraduate}} days, Childe was an atheist and critic of religion, viewing it as a false consciousness based in superstition. In History (1947) he commented that [...] "Magic {{is a way}} of making people believe {{they are going to get}} what they want, whereas religion is a system for persuading them that they ought to <b>want</b> <b>what</b> they get." [...] Archaeologist Colin Renfrew noted that Childe was liberal minded on social issues, but thought that although Childe deplored racism, he did not entirely escape the pervasive 19th century view on distinct differences between different races.|$|E

500|$|Anwar Ibrahim, former UMNO deputy President {{and former}} Deputy Prime Minister, whose Parti Keadilan Rakyat became the second-largest party in Parliament after the elections, and {{the de facto}} leader of the {{opposition}} Pakatan Rakyat coalition, chose to instead reject ketuanan Melayu in favour of [...] "ketuanan rakyat" [...] (people's supremacy). Celebrating the end of his five-year ban from political activity on 15 April 2008, he told reporters: [...] "We are here to counter the massive propaganda campaign by Umno leaders, who are talking on Malay supremacy. And giving clear definitive answer in reply of this, to say that what we <b>want,</b> <b>what</b> we desire for is a new Malaysia, is supremacy for all Malaysians." [...] A week later, his wife Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, president of PKR, told the press that [...] "we should not keep talking about Malay supremacy or marginalising a certain race, which is not what the people want to see," [...] urging instead the adoption of ketuanan rakyat.|$|E
500|$|Verville excelled as a {{draftsman}} and designer, {{but still}} wanted to attend flight school and to become an exhibition pilot. After applying and being passed over three times for the Curtiss Flying School, Verville went to Curtiss, who responded: [...] "No, Mr. Verville you don't {{want to be a}} pilot. We can get all the pilots we <b>want.</b> <b>What</b> we want are designers. You're [...] a designer and you don't know it." [...] While at Curtiss Aeroplane, Verville took an active part {{in the development of the}} transatlantic flying boat America (which was a Curtiss H-2) and the Curtiss Jenny of World War I fame. In the Fall of 1914, Verville left the company and joined the Aeromarine Plane and Motor Company in New Jersey; shortly thereafter, he joined the Thomas-Morse Airplane Company. In March 1915, he returned to Detroit and joined the General Aeroplane Company, where he led his first full design and build to his specifications, the Verville Flying Boat.|$|E
500|$|... "Slug" [...] {{runs for}} 4 minutes, 41 seconds and {{features}} a synthesizer rhythm and guitar harmonics laid over a drum track, with vocals sung by Bono in a murmured voice. Jon Pareles of The New York Times described the song's sound as {{a mix of}} [...] "shimmering echoed guitars with swampy electronic rhythms". The lyrics are sung in a list-like format, and consist of 19 lines, most of which begin with the words [...] "Don't want"; the song's title {{is included in the}} lyrics [...] "Don't want to be a [...] ". The line [...] "Don't <b>want</b> <b>what</b> I deserve" [...] was written by Bono with a sense of [...] "ironic, self-deprecatory humour". The end result is a depiction of celebration set against the thoughts of a desolate soul, as echoed in the closing verse [...] "Don't want to change the frame / Don't want to be a pain / Don't want to stay the same", with an undercurrent of confusion regarding the differences between love and faith.|$|E

[...] Game Informer felt that [...] "every little morsel of platforming goodness in The Wrath of Cortex {{has already been done}} to death on the Playstation." [...] Carlos McElfish of GameZone warned that [...] "if you are looking for an innovative and original experience that does justice to the series you’ll have to look elsewhere." [...] Official Xbox Magazine concluded that [...] "this is a game for those who <b>want</b> <b>what</b> Crash has always had to offer – good graphics, jump-and-spin gameplay, and tons of collectible items. Nothing more, nothing less." [...] Hilary Goldstein felt that while Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex was [...] "a fun game for the most part," [...] "it fails in some areas, like proper game balance and correct use of surround sound." [...] Star Dingo of GamePro concluded that [...] "love it or hate it, Wrath of Cortex Xbox is more of more of the same." [...] Electronic Gaming Monthly felt that [...] "save for a few additions to WOC, like some cool hamster-ball levels, it's almost identical to its predecessors." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Do What U Want" [...] is a mid-tempo synthpop and R track, drawing {{influence}} from 1980s-inspired throbbing synths and an electronic beat. Eric R. Danton of Rolling Stone {{described it as}} a [...] "muscular club beat". James Montgomery from MTV News said that a [...] "lurching, lascivious beat" [...] was the main backbone of the song, interspersed with Gaga's loud-voiced vocals, a [...] "corky" [...] chorus and Kelly's [...] "cool, coital" [...] singing. The song's chorus is built around arpeggios. Complex described its [...] "Do what you <b>want,</b> <b>what</b> you want with my body" [...] hook as [...] "catchy and somewhat raunchy". The song's lyrics represent themes of sexual submissiveness, with Gaga telling off detractors that her thoughts, dreams, and feelings are her own, no matter what one does with her body. Jim Farber of New York Daily News suggested [...] "Do What U Want" [...] to be a response to [...] "everyone who ever made a tart comment about her — which, by now, involves half the planet". Gaga and Kelly alternate singing the lines [...] "Do what u want/ What u want with my body/ Do what u want/ What u want with my body/ Write what you want, say what you want about me/ If you want you know that I'm not sorry".|$|E

In an interview with CNN, he stated that [...] "I'm not an intelligence expert, but what would be learned from putting a camera onto a vulture? You cannot control it.

They toured with Sinéad O'Connor {{in the first}} half of 1988 (Rourke also appeared on her 1990 album I Do Not <b>Want</b> <b>What</b> I Haven't Got). Still in 1988, they were recruited (with Craig Gannon) to Adult Net, but left the band soon afterwards. In 1988 and 1989, they recorded singles with Morrissey. [...] In 1998 they toured and recorded with Aziz Ibrahim (The Stone Roses). In 2001 they formed Specter with Jason Specter and others.

2500|$|Bourdieu thus sees habitus as an {{important}} factor contributing to social reproduction because it is central to generating and regulating the practices that make up social life. [...] Individuals learn to <b>want</b> <b>what</b> conditions make possible for them, and not to aspire to what is not available to them. The conditions {{in which the individual}} lives generate dispositions compatible with these conditions (including tastes in art, literature, food, and music), and in a sense pre-adapted to their demands. The most improbable practices are therefore excluded, as unthinkable, by a kind of immediate submission to order that inclines agents to make a virtue of necessity, that is, to refuse what is categorically denied and to will the inevitable.|$|E
2500|$|Producer Thom Mount (who is {{part-owner}} of {{the real}} Durham Bulls) hired Pete Bock, a former semi-pro baseball player, as a consultant on the film. [...] Bock recruited {{more than a dozen}} minor-league players, ran a tryout camp to recruit an additional 40 to 50 players from lesser ranks, hired several minor-league umpires, and conducted two-a-day workouts and practice games with Tim Robbins pitching and Kevin Costner catching. Bock made sure the actors looked and acted like ballplayers and that the real players acted convincingly in front of the cameras. He said, [...] "the director would say, 'This is the shot we <b>want.</b> <b>What</b> we need is the left fielder throwing a one-hopper to the plate. Then we need a good collision at the plate.' I would select the players I know could do the job, and then we would go out and get it done".|$|E

And then you finally touch it, but, oh, no! It's too late; it's changed. There are also themes of deception and mistrust, but I prefer to express that kind of world-weariness with a light touch. The music has an understated hip-hop thing going on; the groove just chugs along, with simple instrumentation." ...|$|R
