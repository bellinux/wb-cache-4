50|$|Mister <b>Weed-Eater</b> is a {{short story}} by American writer Joe R. Lansdale.|$|E
50|$|Mister <b>Weed-Eater</b> {{recounts the}} story of Mr. Job Harold, who befriends a blind man hired by the church {{across the street to}} cut the church’s lawn. The newly hired landscaper, {{utilizing}} a brand new <b>weed-eater</b> with which to trim the yard, is, of course, unable to evaluate the fruits of his labor. Taking a break from the Texas heat, he turns to Mr. Harold for what appears to be an innocent critique of his work. In actuality, it is a brazen attempt by the groundskeeper to maneuver himself into the man’s house and his life.|$|E
50|$|The {{stems and}} leaves contain furocoumarins, {{chemicals}} {{responsible for the}} characteristic rash of erythematous vesicles (burn-like blisters) and subsequent hyperpigmentation that occurs after getting the clear sap onto one's skin. The chemical is photosensitive, with the rash occurring only after exposure to ultraviolet light. Because of this, phytophotodermatitis may occur after using a <b>weed-eater</b> to remove the plants on a sunny day.|$|E
50|$|Baylor University, then {{a member}} of the Southwest Conference, was {{extended}} an invitation to play in the 1990 Poulan <b>Weed-Eater</b> Independence Bowl before the last game of the season versus Texas. Coach Grant Teaff declined the invitation because the Bears still had an outside chance at the conference championship and an appearance in the Cotton Bowl. The Bears lost to Texas and did not play in a bowl game that season, despite finishing 6-4-1.|$|E
5000|$|First {{published}} in Lansdale’s 1993 Electric Gumbo, subsequently re{{published in}} his 1994 compilation Writer of the Purple Rage, [...] "Mister Weed-Eater" [...] was republished {{again in the}} 2001 anthology High Cotton. A favorite of the author, the story reappeared eight years later in his work entitled Sanctified and Chicken-Fried. Also in 2009 the movie rights for Mister <b>Weed-Eater</b> were optioned by writer/director Brian James Fitzpatrick and actor Damian Maffei. The project has since fallen through.|$|E
5000|$|In 1990, {{the contest}} {{became one of}} the {{earliest}} college bowl games to use a title sponsor, becoming the Poulan <b>Weed-Eater</b> Independence Bowl. Poulan (then a division of AB Electrolux Home Products, now Husqvarna AB) sponsored the game until 1996. Newell Rubbermaid's Sanford brand of writing products took over sponsorship from 1998 until 2000, while MainStay Investments sponsored from 2001 to 2003. In January 2005, the Deja Vu chain of [...] "gentlemen's clubs" [...] offered to become the title sponsor. The offer was rejected.|$|E
