25|$|I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{for your}} {{forgiveness}}, {{that many of}} our dreams didn't come true. That what seemed to us to be simple turned out painfully difficult. I ask forgiveness for the fact that I didn't justify some of the hopes of those people who believed that with one stroke, one burst, one sign we could jump from the grey, stagnant, totalitarian past to a bright, rich, civilized future. I myself believed this. One burst was not enough... but I want you to know – I've never said this, today it's important for me to tell you: the pain of every one of you, I feel in myself, in my heart... in saying farewell, I want to say to every one of you: be happy. You deserve happiness. You deserve happiness, and peace.|$|E

500|$|After Mal and Peter Asher (A head of Apple Records) saw {{the rock}} band the Iveys perform at London's Marquee Club, Mal {{constantly}} {{suggested that the}} Beatles sign the band to Apples label. This eventually happened in July '68 when the Iveys became the first band to be signed to the label. Some of the first Apple recording sessions were produced by Mal and the band eventually changed their name to Badfinger. Evans: [...] "January 13, 1969: Paul [...] is really cutting down on the Apple staff members. I was elevated to office boy [...] and I feel very hurt and sad inside—only big boys don't cry. Why I should feel hurt and reason for writing this is ego. ... I thought I was different from other people in my relationship with The Beatles and being loved by them and treated so nice, I felt {{like one of the}} family. Seems I fetch and carry. I find it difficult to live on the £38 I take home each week and would love to be like their other friends who buy fantastic homes and have all the alterations done by them, and are still going to ask for a rise. I always tell myself—look, everybody wants to take from, be satisfied, try to give and you will receive. After all this time I have about £70 to my name, but was content and happy. Loving them as I do, nothing is too much trouble, because I want to serve them. Feel a bit better now—EGO?" [...] Evans' financial problems started to become such a problem that he had to ask Harrison for money: [...] "April 24: [...] "Had to tell George —'I'm broke'.

Hannes Swoboda, an Austrian socialist MEP and committee member who was denied access to the region, commented that [...] "If they do {{not allow us to}} go, we have a clear hint that something bad has happened. If something is hidden we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> why. It can only be because some of the allegations are true."

2500|$|Robinson came {{to teach}} at Howard University after {{delivering}} a lecture there in February 1979. Impressed with his knowledge and force of personality, students formed a committee to investigate his background, then met with faculty to discuss their findings. The joint student-faculty group then petitioned Howard University President James E. Cheek to hire Robinson as the next dean of the School of Architecture and Planning. Robinson joined Howard in September 1979. During his tenure as dean, he expanded the curriculum, organized the African American Architect Initiative, and established a program to encourage D.C. schoolchildren to choose a career in urban design and planning. Robinson has long advocated equal access for African-American architects, but argues that black architects should seek work {{where they can get}} it. [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for anything. It's embarrassing to me," [...] he told Newsday in 1991. [...] "I have a new sense of being a radical. I really had to, with the barrage of negative press and complaints of what we don't have. I'm tired of it. ... We simply aren't going to get large corporate work. That's a different network. But we have our own network. We have the black church, we have the black sororities and fraternities. Of course we want equal access, but no profession is without its barriers." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 20, it was {{revealed}} that Niagara Falls, New York, was attempting to bill Wallenda an additional $25,000 for police and fireman overtime. [...] City officials cited the state law passed to allow the walk, which read [...] "Mr. Wallenda shall pay... reasonable costs associated with security or law enforcement stemming from this activity". [...] Dyster said to forgive the alleged debt would amount to [...] "a gift of public funds". [...] Wallenda called the request [...] "disgusting and sad," [...] saying [...] "This was a great thing for the area... gave me a key to the city, and now they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for more money?" [...] He noted that the city staged a downtown festival {{to take advantage of the}} crowds, and said he should not have to pay the security costs related to the festival. [...] His lawyer, John P. Bartolomei, said Wallenda was only responsible for money spent by the city in the park itself, which had already been more than paid. [...] He also noted that Wallenda's contract was with the state parks commission, not the city itself. [...] Senator Maziarz called the city's position [...] "shortsighted" [...] and accused Dyster of being [...] "disingenuous". [...] He noted that Dyster had been against the walk from the beginning and that the city had never tried to bill other entertainers for costs associated with their acts. [...] On July 24, the city council passed a resolution encouraging Dyster to stop pursuing the alleged debt by a 4-1 margin. [...] Dyster responded by stating he was legally obligated to continue his efforts, remarking [...] "Since the council didn't establish the fee I'm not sure if the council can forgive it". [...] He did, however, say he would ask the state comptroller for second opinion.|$|E
