2500|$|While at UCLA, Dean dated Beverly Wills, {{an actress}} with CBS, and Jeanette Lewis, a classmate. Bast and Dean often double-dated with them. Wills began dating Dean alone, later telling Bast, [...] "Bill, there's {{something}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you. It's Jimmy and me. I mean, we're in love." [...] They broke up after Dean [...] "exploded" [...] when another man {{asked her to}} dance while they were at a function: [...] "Jimmy saw red. He grabbed the fellow by the collar and threatened to blacken both of his eyes," [...] she said. Dean had also remained in contact with his girlfriend in New York, Barbara Glenn, whom he dated for two years. Their love letters sold at auction in 2011 for $36,000.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nor one either, sir,' said Mr. Kendal. 'What shall <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Uncle William about you! I'm {{afraid you}} are one of the chief causes of mamma not knowing how to go to London.' ...|$|E
5000|$|... "At first, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{trouble getting}} people to help themselves, because we're from a country where people say, 'Get off my land', so <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> people it was OK .... nearly 50% said it had had a {{positive}} impact on their income." [...] -- Mary Clear ...|$|R
60|$|When <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{finished}} the dishes we smuggled our platter and tureen {{out of the}} house and went home. Laura and Margaret were busy painting and studying and were just as sweet-tempered as if we hadn't robbed them of their dinner. But <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them the whole story before we even took off our hats.|$|R
5000|$|Shonda Rhimes {{stated that}} the fourth season will {{focus more on the}} core {{characters}}, as opposed to the third season where more characters were introduced. Rhimes explained why: [...] "Kerry Washington couldn't work 14 hours a day, so <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> our story in a different way, and that necessitated other people both picking up the slack in beautiful ways".|$|R
6000|$|... “They {{have made}} us out,” Joyce said. “Of course, {{at first they}} took us for a native canoe, for they would be looking for the gig. They don’t know yet what bad news <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them.” ...|$|E
60|$|The {{next story}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> is so strange and wild, {{that it would}} seem better to befit the cloudy times when history {{had not yet been}} disentangled from fable, than the {{comparatively}} clear light of the fourteenth century.|$|E
60|$|But victory {{does not}} always crown the efforts of our {{lifeboat}}s. Sometimes <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> of partial failure or defeat, and it {{is due to the}} lifeboat cause to show that our coast heroes are to the full as daring, self-sacrificing, and noble, in the time of disaster as they are in the day of victory.|$|E
60|$|MRS. BANGER. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> come <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you plainly {{that the}} Anti-Suffragets {{are going to}} fight.|$|R
5000|$|... "So he {{left and}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Mýa like, 'Yo Mýa, Jay {{wants to do}} the record but he feels like you're not even giving him any love, like no thank you or none of that.' But that's just her personality. So we went to L.A. for some music awards were around that time and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> one more shot at getting Jay {{to come to the}} studio.|$|R
60|$|Thus ends {{all that}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> got <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> of {{the adventures of}} the Norsemen in the West, and the Discovery of America before Columbus.|$|R
6000|$|But {{though these}} are indigenous, like the Indians, I doubt {{whether they are}} any hardier than those backwoodsmen among the apple-trees, which, though descended from {{cultivated}} stocks, plant themselves in distant fields and forests, where the soil is favorable to them. I know of no trees which have more difficulties to contend with, and which more sturdily resist their foes. These are the ones whose story <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> It oftentimes reads thus:-- ...|$|E
60|$|Who {{that has}} ever seen them can forget the ruins of Blossholme Abbey, set upon their mount between the great waters of the tidal estuary to the north, the rich lands and grazing marshes that, backed with woods, border it east and south, and to the west by the rolling uplands, merging at last into purple moor, and, far away, the sombre eternal hills! Probably the scene has not changed very much {{since the days of}} Henry VIII, when those things {{happened}} of which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell,</b> for here no large town has arisen, nor have mines been dug or factories built to affront the earth and defile the air with their hideousness and smoke.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have saved}} him," [...] said the doctor, joyfully. [...] "I will answer for his recovery. Only let that woman {{come here for}} the reward; and leave me {{to deal with her}} as she deserves. In the meantime, my dear, don't go away from the palace on any account until I give you permission. I am going to send a message {{immediately}} to Signor Andrea D'Arbino to come and hear the extraordinary disclosure that you have made to me. Go back to read to the count, as usual, until I want you again; but, remember, you must not drop a word to him yet of what you have said to me. He must be carefully prepared for all that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him; and must be kept quite in the dark until those preparations are made." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know," [...] said Adelaide Chadd bitterly. [...] "I suppose <b>we</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> {{him about}} this. I thought that no good fortune would ever come easily to us." ...|$|R
2500|$|Some people {{accused me}} of being pro-Muslim in Bosnia, but I {{realised}} that {{our job is to}} give all sides an equal hearing, but in cases of genocide you can't just be neutral. You can't just say, [...] "Well, this little boy {{was shot in the head}} and killed in besieged Sarajevo and that guy over there did it, but maybe he was upset because he had an argument with his wife." [...] No, there is no equality there, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the truth.|$|R
6000|$|... "It'll be very provoking," [...] she said, {{forecasting}} {{the minor}} trouble {{of the greater}} trouble's failure. [...] "Everybody will wonder if it isn't father, and <b>we</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them it isn't." ...|$|R
60|$|And now <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> of {{the hardest}} blow which fell upon poor Ethel, and this was that her good uncle Thomas Newcome {{believed}} the charges against her. He was willing enough to listen now to anything which was said against that branch of the family. With such a traitor, double-dealer, dastard as Barnes at its head, what could {{the rest of the}} race be? When the Colonel offered to endow Ethel and Clive with every shilling he had in the world, had not Barnes, the arch-traitor, temporised and told him falsehoods, and hesitated about throwing him off until the Marquis had declared himself? Yes. The girl he and poor Clive loved so was ruined by her artful relatives, was unworthy of his affection and his boy's, was to be banished, like her worthless brother, out of his regard for ever. And the man she had chosen in preference to his Clive!--a roue, a libertine, whose extravagances and dissipations were the talk of every club, who had no wit, nor talents, not even constancy (for had he not taken the first opportunity to throw her off?) to recommend him--only a great title and a fortune wherewith to bribe her! For shame, for shame! Her engagement to this man was a blot upon her--the rupture only a just punishment and humiliation. Poor unhappy girl! let her take care of her wretched brother's abandoned children, give up the world, and amend her life.|$|E

50|$|If {{you would}} do this for me, I just {{do not know what}} I could do for you. You {{certainly}} will not regret it, because in addition to your fees, my gratitude and my friendship will certainly make a contribution. Please accept sincere greetings from my wife. She asks me to write to you that she is looking forward to meeting you and your wife in the near future, as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you about Greece and talk about Rome and many other wonderful places.|$|E
60|$|Then I {{told him}} of my father's cruel death; of what <b>we</b> <b>had</b> found <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the horrible story, and before I had {{finished}} the tears were running down his cheeks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush, dear; we must cry softly, {{or mother}} will hear, and come up, and then <b>we</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> You know <b>we</b> said we wouldn't seem <b>to</b> mind not <b>having</b> any Christmas, {{she felt so}} sorry about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{might well}} have been, sir, but what <b>we</b> <b>had</b> covenanted <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you this day <b>we</b> <b>have</b> told unwittingly, methinks, already. I could not be in your daughter's company, and have the grace of her gentle ministerings--" ...|$|R
50|$|And <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them, {{you know}} what, if you're {{not going to}} allow us to do that, there will be consequences. You will be taken to the human rights commission, you will be taken to the press council, and you know what? If you manage {{to get rid of the}} human rights code {{provisions}} hate speech, we will then take you to the civil courts system. And you know what? Some judge out there might just think that perhaps it's time to have a tort of group defamation, and you might be liable for a few million dollars.|$|E
5000|$|... "How are you doing, Lee? Sorry {{about this}} projection, but it's {{the only way}} we could reach you. We can't tell you how {{relieved}} we are to have you here. Now, before we get ahead of ourselves, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you something. You're the last one, it's all gone. We understand how you might feel. Connection is perhaps the most cherished thing any being can have. That's the thing. That's why we've been listening. The place you see here is a scrapbook of sorts, a collection of memories and mementos of mankind's brief existence. It's a good thing we found you. We look forward to meeting you, Lee." ...|$|E
5000|$|We {{are sure}} that your Magnificence knows how, after much {{complicated}} negotiation about the intended marriage of the renowned Prince Pedro, your eldest son, and our most beloved daughter Joan, {{which was designed to}} nurture perpetual peace and create an indissoluble union between our Royal Houses, we sent our said daughter to Bordeaux, en route for your territories in Spain. But see, with what intense bitterness of heart <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you this, destructive Death (who seizes young and old alike, sparing no one and reducing rich and poor to the same level) has lamentably snatched from both of us our dearest daughter, whom we loved best of all, as her virtues demanded ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Meanwhile <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> {{entered the}} cave where you said no man might set a foot, and {{have seen him}} who sits within, the true god." [...] (Here Bastin tried to interrupt, but was suppressed by Bickley.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{have a fight}} before very long--I {{can feel}} it in my bones," [...] {{declared}} Larry. And he was right; but before telling of that contest, and what surprising results it led <b>to,</b> <b>we</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> of something else which occurred, to delight Larry exceedingly.|$|R
60|$|When Pereira was gone, {{our party}} {{and that of}} Retief fell into talk, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> much <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> Especially was the commandant {{interested}} {{in the story of}} my bet with Dingaan, whereby I saved the lives of all my companions by shooting the vultures.|$|R
5000|$|Anand {{believes}} in fighting communalism by journalism that provides an alternate viewpoint to that {{expressed in the}} mainstream and right wing communalist newspapers and journals.He believes there is huge power in people crossing caste and religious lines to fight for social justice.Talking of violence, he has said: [...] "Put bluntly, do groups and organizations whose rights we defend themselves believe in democratic forms of mass mobilization? Is it ethically right and politically tenable that rights groups focus their entire attention on violations by state personnel but remain mum when 'militants' maim, rape or kill fellow citizens".Speaking of the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, Anand said: [...] "They (terrorists) claim {{to be doing this}} in the name of Islam. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> them, 'Not in our name'".|$|E

5000|$|Constance was {{originally}} betrothed to Prince Robert, youngest son of Philip IV of France and Joan I of Navarre. The engagement was broken when Robert died young {{in the summer}} of 1308. King Philip sent Constance's father a sorrowful letter announcing the news. Here is an excerpt from the letter: [...] "We are sure that your Majesty knows that the complicated negotiation about the intended marriage of the Princess Constance and our most beloved son Robert was designed to nurture perpetual peace and create an indissoluble union between our Royal Houses. But see, with what intense bitterness of heart <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you this, destructive Death has lamentably snatched from us our son, whom we loved best of all. No fellow human being could be surprised if we were inwardly desolated by the sting of this bitter grief. But we give thanks to God that one of our own family, free of all stain, whom we have loved with our life, has been sent to Heaven." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nod {{came back}} and told this news to Thumb, who was sitting with a great strip of his jacket bound round {{his head like a}} Turk's turban.

6000|$|... "Now, let us sit down. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> so much <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> each other, and, moreover, I am ravenous for breakfast, as I have ridden {{forty miles}} since sunrise." ...|$|R
60|$|PHOEBE (hastily, lest her sister's face should {{betray the}} truth). Susan, <b>we</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> him now.

But indeed since I met you to-day and {{you told me you}} <b>had</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> communicate <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been puzzling what it could be, and we concluded {{that you were going to}} be married.|$|R
