500|$|With {{regard to}} the film's overall design, Roger Ebert stated, [...] "It is {{flawlessly}} crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding... Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well." [...] He credited the [...] "technical difficulties" [...] with being [...] "so daunting that it's a <b>wonder</b> <b>when</b> the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion" [...] and [...] "found [...] convinced by both the story and the sad saga". He named it his ninth best film of 1997. On the television program Siskel & Ebert, the film received [...] "two thumbs up" [...] and was praised for its accuracy in recreating the ship's sinking; Ebert described the film as [...] "a glorious Hollywood epic" [...] and [...] "well worth the wait," [...] and Gene Siskel found Leonardo DiCaprio [...] "captivating". James Berardinelli stated, [...] "Meticulous in detail, yet vast in scope and intent, Titanic {{is the kind of}} epic motion picture event that has become a rarity. You don't just watch Titanic, you experience it." [...] It was named his second best film of 1997. Almar Haflidason of the BBC wrote that [...] "the sinking of the great ship is no secret, yet for many exceeded expectations in sheer scale and tragedy" [...] and that [...] "when you consider that [...] tops a bum-numbing three-hour running time, then you have a truly impressive feat of entertainment achieved by Cameron". Joseph McBride of Boxoffice Magazine concluded, [...] "To describe Titanic as the greatest disaster movie ever made is to sell it short. James Cameron's recreation of the 1912 sinking of the 'unsinkable' liner {{is one of the most}} magnificent pieces of serious popular entertainment ever to emanate from Hollywood." ...|$|E
2500|$|I couldn't {{approach}} {{black people}} with the truth because they like lies. They live lies... At one time I felt that white people were to blame for everything, but then I found {{out that they were}} just puppets and pawns of some greater force, which has been using them... Some force is having a good time [...] and looking, enjoying itself up in a reserved seat, wondering, [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>when</b> they're going to wake up."... I used to be interested in saving black people. Now, they're expendable as far as I'm concerned.|$|E

2500|$|Muir {{often used}} the term [...] "home" [...] {{as a metaphor for}} both nature and his general {{attitude}} toward the [...] "natural world itself," [...] notes Holmes. He often used domestic language to describe his scientific observations, as when he saw nature as providing a home for even the smallest plant life: [...] "the little purple plant, tended by its Maker, closed its petals, crouched low in its crevice of a home, and enjoyed the storm in safety." [...] Muir also saw nature as his own home, as when he wrote friends and described the Sierra as [...] "God's mountain mansion." [...] He considered not only the mountains as home, however, as he also felt a closeness even to the smallest objects: [...] "The very stones seem talkative, sympathetic, brotherly. No <b>wonder</b> <b>when</b> we consider that we all have the same Father and Mother." ...|$|E
