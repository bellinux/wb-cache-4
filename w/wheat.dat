5|$|<b>Wheat</b> beer is brewed {{with a large}} {{proportion}} of <b>wheat</b> although it often also contains a significant proportion of malted barley. <b>Wheat</b> beers are usually top-fermented (in Germany they have to be by law). The flavour of <b>wheat</b> beers varies considerably, depending upon the specific style.|$|E
5|$|A {{danger to}} {{agriculture}} is <b>wheat</b> rust, a pathogenic fungus causing reddish patches, coloured by its spores. A virulent {{form of the}} <b>wheat</b> disease, stem rust, strain Ug99, spread from Africa across to the Arabian Peninsula by 2007. In field trials in Kenya, more than 85% of <b>wheat</b> samples, including major cultivars, were susceptible, implying that higher crop diversity was required. The Nobel laureate Norman Borlaug argued for action to ensure global food security.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} few decades of the 20th century, Minneapolis began to lose its {{dominant}} position in the flour milling industry, after reaching its peak in 1915–1916. The rise of steam power, and later electric power, eroded the advantage that St. Anthony Falls provided in water power. The <b>wheat</b> fields of the Dakotas and Minnesota's Red River Valley began suffering from soil exhaustion due to consecutive <b>wheat</b> crops, leading {{to an increase in}} <b>wheat</b> leaf rust and related crop diseases. The farmers of the southern plains developed a variety of hardy red winter <b>wheat</b> suitable for bread flour, and the Kansas City area gained prominence in milling. Also, due to changes in rail shipping rates, millers in Buffalo, New York were able to ship their flour more competitively.|$|E
5|$|The 27th-most agriculturally {{productive}} state, Oklahoma is {{fifth in}} cattle production and fifth in production of <b>wheat.</b> Approximately 5.5 percent of American beef comes from Oklahoma, {{while the state}} produces 6.1 percent of American <b>wheat,</b> 4.2 percent of American pig products, and 2.2 percent of dairy products.|$|E
50|$|The {{polyploid}} <b>wheats</b> are tetraploid (4 sets of chromosomes, 2n=4x=28), or hexaploid (6 sets of chromosomes, 2n=6x=42). The tetraploid wild <b>wheats</b> are wild emmer, T. dicoccoides, and T.araraticum. Wild emmer is the {{ancestor of}} all the domesticated tetraploid <b>wheats,</b> with one exception: T. araraticum is the wild ancestor of T. timopheevi.|$|R

40|$|The {{grain and}} flour of two Czech and two Polish winter <b>wheats</b> {{of the same}} {{classification}} were examined. The quality of the grain (evaluated with standard methods), the endosperm microstructure and the size distribution of the starch granules numerically studied with digital image analysis (DIA) methods were determined. The endosperm microstructure {{was found to be}} typical for soft (Leguan and Flair), medium (Line 2038), and hard (Begra) <b>wheats.</b> Stronger <b>wheats</b> (Line 2038 and Begra) showed a higher percentage of small B-type starch granules, compared to soft <b>wheats</b> (Leguan and Flair). Direct comparison of the data obtained for Czech and Polish <b>wheats</b> showed only approximate DIA results because of different agricultural and climatic conditions, which strongly influenced the grain properties examined but the same tendency in the variability of endosperm microstructure and starch granule size distribution for hard and soft <b>wheats</b> from both countries was confirmed...|$|R
5|$|The small American {{merchant}} {{class and}} {{officers of the}} HBC loaned settlers more credit than most could refund. Fears of creditors demanding restitution from the farmers lead to <b>wheat</b> receipts and scrips issued by the government declared valid currency in 1845. The law decreeing <b>wheat</b> as currency was ridiculed for not establishing financial standards for the merchants, who were de facto bankers. Between 1847 and 1848 the local market for <b>wheat</b> became flooded from overproduction, causing a decline in its value. The legislature repealed previous regulations on 20 December 1847, making only gold, silver and treasury drafts on valid currency. Thus, the creditors of the territory were able to protect their financial standing by removing <b>wheat</b> as tender.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh {{made several}} {{painting}} excursions during {{visits to the}} landscape around Arles. He made paintings of harvests, <b>wheat</b> fields and other rural landmarks of the area, including The Old Mill (1888); {{a good example of}} a picturesque structure bordering the <b>wheat</b> fields beyond. At various points, Van Gogh painted the view from his window – at The Hague, Antwerp, and Paris. These works culminated in The <b>Wheat</b> Field series, which depicted the view from his cells in the asylum at Saint-Rémy.|$|E

40|$|In this manuscript, {{micro-climate}} {{of winter}} <b>wheat's</b> group under CK(No fertilizer), N(Inorganic N fertilizer), NK(Inorganic N and K fertilizer), NP(Inorganic N and P fertilizer), and NPK(Inorganic N, P and K fertilizer) fertilizations was studied. The {{results showed that}} CK, N and NK fertilization treatments would lead to higher <b>wheat's</b> canopy temperature and surface ground temperature and lower leaves SPAD value at the elongation stage and filling stage, which were not favor for <b>wheat's</b> growth and obtained lower grain yield; while NP and NPK treatment were on the contrary, they were benefited for <b>wheat's</b> growth and gained better grain yield. Compared with CK, N, and NK treatment, there were about 0. 5 ~ 8 ℃ on the canopy and 0. 5 ~ 16 ℃ on the soil surface could be changed by NP and NPK treatment, respectively; and about 3 ~ 17 SPAD unit could be improved.

5|$|It was {{not until}} after 9,500 BC that the eight {{so-called}} founder crops of agriculture appear: first emmer and einkorn <b>wheat,</b> then hulled barley, peas, lentils, bitter vetch, chick peas and flax. These eight crops occur more or less simultaneously on Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) sites in the Levant, although <b>wheat</b> {{was the first to}} be grown and harvested on a significant scale. At around the same time (9400 BC), parthenocarpic fig trees were domesticated.|$|E

Some have been found to have useful active ingredients, though these do not always correspond with traditional uses of the fungi concerned. Ergot and various cereal smuts, such as Ustilago tritici (<b>wheat</b> grain smut) were used for disorders of pregnancy. Yeasts, made into a boiled paste with <b>wheat</b> flour, were used in India to treat fevers and dysentery. Wounds were treated in Europe with moulds, using for example a slice of mouldy bread or mouldy <b>wheat</b> straw, with active ingredients patulin and other penicillin-like compounds.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at elucidating {{numerical}} variation of chromosomes in newly synthesized hexaploid <b>wheats.</b> We carried out artificial crosses between Triticum carthlicum (2 n = 4 x = 28, AABB) as female parent and Aegilops tauschii (2 n = 2 x = 14, DD) as male parent, obtaining intergeneric F 1 hybrids (2 n = 3 x = 21, ABD). After self-fertilization of the F 1 hybrids having 21 somatic chromosomes, we obtained F 2 seeds (synthetic hexaploid <b>wheats),</b> and determined their somatic chromosome number. Of the expected 150 cross combinations of F 1 hybrids between six strains of T. carthlicum and 25 strains of Ae. tauschii, 67 cross combinations of synthetic hexaploid <b>wheats</b> were obtained. Compared to strains of Ae. tauschii ssp. tauschii, those of Ae. tauschii ssp. strangulata produced synthetic hexaploid <b>wheats</b> showing euploidy with a high frequency. In addition, among strains of Ae. tauchii ssp. tauschii, those from Iran contributed more {{to the production of}} synthetic hexaploid <b>wheats</b> showing euploidy than those from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkey or the former USSR...|$|R

5|$|Theophrastus groups {{together}} the cereals and the legumes (peas and beans), and includes millet and other many-seeded plants like sesame also. These {{can only be}} grown from seed. They can be sown early, as with <b>wheat,</b> barley and beans, or in spring after the equinox, for plants like lentils, tares and peas. Vetch and chickpeas can, he reports, be sown at either season. When sprouting, beans form a shape like a penis, from which the root grows down and the leafy stem upwards. <b>Wheat</b> and barley flower {{for four or five}} days, whereas the legumes flower for much longer. Theophrastus reports that these plants grow differently according to the region, so for instance crops in Salamis appear earlier than those elsewhere in Attica. <b>Wheat</b> varieties are recorded as being named for their localities; they differ in colour, size, growth habit and food value. In a place near Bactra in Asia the <b>wheat</b> grains are said to grow as big as the stone of an olive, whereas pulses do not in Theophrastus's view vary to the same extent.|$|E

40|$|A set of waxy (amylose-free) {{experimental}} spring <b>wheats</b> (Triticum aestivum L.) {{of diverse}} parentage were grown, {{along with two}} nonwaxy and two partial waxy check cultivars, at diverse North American cultural environments. Grain yield and functional attributes of derived flours were determined. Average grain yield of the waxy lines {{did not differ significantly}} from the average yield of the check cultivars, but significant differences were observed amongst the waxy lines. Grain hardness varied significantly amongst the waxy lines, and both hard and soft textured waxy lines were identified. Analysis of flour quality traits showed few differences between waxy lines and check cultivars for traits primarily related to protein concentration or protein quality, but many significant differences between properties primarily dependent upon starch structure, or related to milling behavior. Protein-related quality attributes of waxy <b>wheats</b> demonstrated environmental and genotypic variances similar to those typical of non-waxy <b>wheats.</b> Starch-related quality attributes of waxy <b>wheats</b> showed remarkable stability across environments, but some significant genetic variation was observed. End-users interested in employing waxy <b>wheats</b> should be able to select desired waxy lines, and feel confident that the starch-related functional properties will be environmentally stable...|$|R
