5|$|In January 2001, {{plans were}} drawn up {{to move to}} a 55,000-seat {{purpose-built}} arena {{on the site of the}} King's Dock in Liverpool. The proposed stadium <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> retractable roof enabling it to be used for concerts and chairman Bill Kenwright had hoped to have it ready for the 2005–06 season.|$|E
5|$|Another {{idea that}} McDonnell {{proposed}} was {{a variation of}} a carrier-based Phantom, {{with the goal of}} improving catapult performance and lowering approach speeds. The F-4(HL) <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> longer fuselage and wingspan, with less sweep, stabilators with increased area and air intakes with auxiliary blow-in doors to increase airflow at low speeds. This proposal was not taken forward.|$|E
5|$|Megalodon is {{represented}} in the fossil record by teeth, vertebral centra, and coprolites. As with all sharks, the skeleton of megalodon was formed of cartilage rather than bone; consequently most fossil specimens are poorly preserved. To support its large dentition, the jaws of megalodon {{would have been more}} massive, stouter, and more strongly developed than those of the great white, which possesses a comparatively gracile dentition. Its chondrocranium, the cartilaginous skull, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> blockier and more robust appearance than that of the great white. Its fins were proportional to its larger size.|$|E

50|$|The now {{cancelled}} Prairie Parkway limited-access highway <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> interchange with US 34, between Needham Road and Waubonsee Drive in {{the city}} of Plano.|$|R
50|$|Note that if White <b>had</b> played S-7b {{earlier in}} the opening (instead of S-6b), then their king <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> escape route from this {{particular}} checking sequence.|$|R
5|$|Some {{species of}} ceratopsians, {{especially}} Centrosaurus and its relatives, {{appear to have}} been gregarious, living in herds. This is suggested by bonebed finds with the remains of many individuals of different ages. Like modern migratory herds, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> significant effect on their environment, as well as serving as a major food source for predators.|$|E
5|$|The German {{aircraft}} carrier Graf Zeppelin {{was the lead}} ship {{in a class of}} two carriers of the same name ordered by the Kriegsmarine. She was the only {{aircraft carrier}} launched by Germany and represented part of the Kriegsmarines attempt to create a well-balanced oceangoing fleet, capable of projecting German naval power far beyond the narrow confines of the Baltic and North Seas. The carrier <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> complement of 42 fighters and dive bombers.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} they were said to damage crops {{probably}} contributed to them being hunted. The French settlers began to clear forests using the slash-and-burn technique for deforestation in the 1730s, which in itself <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> large effect on the parrot population and on the other animals that nest in tree cavities.|$|E
50|$|The {{designated}} use for Glade Run is aquatic life. A potential impoundment site on {{the stream}} was considered by the Lycoming County Planning Commission in 1969. It <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> area of 135 acre if constructed.|$|R
50|$|He was a skilful boxer, {{who showed}} {{brilliant}} footwork {{and knew how}} to use the ring. However, he suffered throughout his career with cuts, often <b>having</b> fights stopped despite being ahead on points. Without this failing, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> even more successful career.|$|R
2500|$|In 1996, a {{group of}} Chinese {{fishermen}} discovered a , [...] wide ship about three meters below the surface near the Huaguang Reef. The wreckage covered 180 square meters meaning that the ship <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> estimated displacement capacity of 60 tons and 11 cabins.|$|R
5|$|Academic {{research}} {{increased at}} the turn of the 20th century, and as the Ministry of Works took control of the sites, government spending on these investigations began. Historians such as Sidney Toy and Charles Peers published work on the sites, and research continued under Arnold Taylor, who joined the Office of Works as an assistant inspector in 1935. Major academic reports were published in the 1950s, adding to the sites' reputation. Taylor was also instrumental in the successful opposition to road projects proposed in the 1970s which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> substantial impact on the appearance of the Conwy site. In the late 20th century, detailed reconstructions of the castles were painted by historical artists including Terry Ball, John Banbury and Ivan Lapper.|$|E
5|$|After the First Crusade, Crusaders who did {{not return}} to their homes in Europe helped found the Crusader states of the Principality of Antioch, the County of Edessa, the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the County of Tripoli. The castles they founded to secure their {{acquisitions}} were designed mostly by Syrian master-masons. Their design was very similar to that of a Roman fort or Byzantine tetrapyrgia which were square in plan and had square towers at each corner that did not project much beyond the curtain wall. The keep of these Crusader castles <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> square plan and generally be undecorated.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with the}} {{situation}} after the redistribution of population in the later clearances and the industrial revolution, these numbers would have been evenly spread over the kingdom, with roughly half living north of the Tay. Perhaps ten per cent of the population lived in one of many burghs that {{grew up in the}} later medieval period, mainly in the east and south. It has been suggested that they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> mean population of about 2,000, but many would be much smaller than 1,000 and the largest, Edinburgh, probably had a population of over 10,000 {{at the beginning of the}} modern era and by 1750, with its suburbs it had reached 57,000. The only other towns above 10,000 by the end of the period were Glasgow with 32,000, Aberdeen with around 16,000 and Dundee with 12,000.|$|E
500|$|Dinheirosaurus is {{an average}} sized diplodocid, and <b>had</b> <b>an</b> {{elongated}} neck and tail.

50|$|The Olympic {{village was}} to <b>have</b> been built along the Manchester Ship Canal in {{converted}} warehouses {{close to the}} sporting venues which would give athletes the ability to walk to 14 of the 25 venues. Every athlete <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> individual bedroom in the properties.|$|R
50|$|On 17 November 1999 a law was {{proposed}} to the XIII Legislature of the Republic {{which would make}} the Agro Nocerino Sarnese an Italian province; the law was not passed. The proposed province <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> area of 185.14 km2 and a population of 271,017.|$|R
5|$|Darwin was a {{prolific}} writer. Even without {{publication of his}} works on evolution, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> considerable reputation {{as the author of}} The Voyage of the Beagle, as a geologist who had published extensively on South America and had solved the puzzle of the formation of coral atolls, and as a biologist who had published the definitive work on barnacles. While On the Origin of Species dominates perceptions of his work, The Descent of Man and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals had considerable impact, and his books on plants including The Power of Movement in Plants were innovative studies of great importance, as was his final work on The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, {{commissioned}} by the painter Lluís Graner, he designed the decoration of the Sala Mercè, in the Rambla dels Estudis, {{one of the first}} cinemas in Barcelona; the theatre imitated a cave, inspired by the Coves del Drac (Dragon's Caves) in Mallorca. Also for Graner he designed a detached house in the Bonanova district of Barcelona, of which only the foundations and the main gate were built, with three openings: for people, vehicles and birds; the building <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> structure similar to the Casa Batlló or the porter's lodge of the Park Güell.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 {{there had}} been plans for a £130 million {{combined}} cycle gas turbine power station {{on the site of}} the Ever Ready battery factory to the West of the site of the North station. AES Electrical applied to the Department of Trade and Industry for permission to build the station, which would have been twice as efficient as the coal-fired Stella stations and the first major electricity generation site built in Tyne and Wear in over 40years. The station <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> generating capacity of 350MW. It would have taken three years to build, and created 400construction jobs, as well as 40full-time jobs after construction. But the proposal was opposed by the coal mining industry and dropped.|$|E
50|$|VH1 greenlit {{a second}} season of Supergroup which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> all female ensemble. Ann Wilson of Heart, Charlotte Caffey of The Go-Go's, and drummer Stephanie Eulinberg of Kid Rock fame were slated to take part. Financial and {{scheduling}} difficulties put a halt on the project.|$|R
25|$|The “Undefeated” army now {{created a}} unique problem for Carthage. Had Hamilcar {{suffered}} a decisive defeat, casualties and prisoners <b>would</b> <b>have</b> diminished their numbers and Carthage <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> {{excuse not to}} pay anything. But now the 20,000 man army <b>had</b> to be paid their full due.|$|R
25|$|On Tuesday 8 October 1991 a United Airlines Boeing 747-122 N4728U made an {{emergency}} landing after its intended destination, Auckland Airport, was closed by fog. It was estimated that if the plane <b>had</b> continued to its planned alternate destination, Christchurch, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> unacceptable 15 minutes of fuel on board.|$|R
5|$|In 2002, Coria and Currie {{found that}} various {{features}} of the rear part of the skull (such as the frontwards slope of the occiput and low and wide occipital condyle) indicate that Giganotosaurus <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> good capability of moving the skull sideways {{in relation to the}} front neck vertebrae. These features may also have been related to the increased mass and length of the jaw muscles; the jaw articulation of Giganotosaurus and other carcharodontosaurids was moved hindwards to increase the length of the jaw musculature, enabling faster closure of the jaws, whereas tyrannosaurs increased the mass of the lower jaw musculature, to increase the power of their bite.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} round, Teixeira {{connected}} with a head kick for three points. He delivered another blow to Atias' head in the second round, bringing the score to 8:0. Atias' coach got the score adjusted to 7:0 after a discussion with the judges. Teixeira's success continued, scoring 16 total points {{by the end of}} the third round. Atias' only scored two points after being penalized for an illegal kick to the legs. Atias lost in the round of 16 against Venilton Teixeira from Brazil by point gap of 2–16. Atias <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> chance to compete for the bronze medal if Teixeira reached the finals, however he failed to do so and therefore Atias was eliminated from competition.|$|E
5|$|The simple, low-crowned teeth {{indicate}} that Paraceratherium was a browser with a diet consisting of relatively soft leaves and shrubs. Later rhinoceroses were grazers, with high-crowned teeth because their diets contained grit that quickly wore down their teeth. Studies of mesowear on Paraceratherium teeth confirm the creatures {{had a soft}} diet of leaves; microwear studies {{have yet to be}} conducted. Isotope analysis shows that Paraceratherium fed chiefly on C3 plants, which are mainly leaves. Like its perissodactyl relatives, the horses, tapirs, and other rhinoceroses, Paraceratherium would have been a hindgut fermenter; it would extract relatively little nutrition from its food and would have to eat large volumes to survive. Like other large herbivores, Paraceratherium <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> large digestive tract.|$|E
25|$|In the 1890s, the {{twilight}} {{years of the}} Joseon kingdom, Protestant missionaries gained significant influence, and led a demonisation of the traditional religion through the press, and even carried out campaigns of physical suppression of local cults. The Protestant discourse <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> influence on all further attempts to uproot Muism.|$|R
50|$|In 1941 {{work for}} this project started; about 2 km of a dike north of Marken was built. It <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> area of nearly 600 km2. But the German {{occupation}} stopped the project. Later, {{it was decided that}} the Flevopolder should <b>have</b> priority. In 1957, the island of Marken was connected to mainland Holland. In 1976 the dam Houtribdijk connecting Enkhuizen and Lelystad was completed, a necessary step in the construction of Markerwaard, the dikes for the bordering lakes were still to be completed. However the entire project became mired in political and environmental controversy. In the late 1970s, the project was revised down leaving wide bordering lakes between the polder and North Holland. Marken would remain a peninsula, unlike on the original project. At this stage, the Markerwaard <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> area of 410 km2.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, {{there were}} talks about {{incorporating}} {{the villages of}} Graniteville, Vaucluse, and Warrenville; as a result, the towns approved a referendum to vote {{on whether or not}} to incorporate. If approved, the municipality <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> area of around 20 sq mi. The referendum was defeated by a two-to-one margin in August 2008.|$|R
5|$|Two Gemini-derived {{spacecraft}} {{were considered}} for unmanned resupply flights. The {{first of these}} would have involved a Gemini spacecraft, with all systems for manned flight, re-entry and landing removed. The spacecraft would have docked using a port {{at the front of}} the spacecraft. Cargo would have been transferred through the nose of the spacecraft, where the re-entry attitude control system was located on the manned spacecraft. The spacecraft was equipped with a liquid propellant engine to perform rendezvous, and to reboost the space station. The other proposal was for a new spacecraft to be built for unmanned missions, but re-using as many Gemini systems as possible. It <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> higher cargo capacity than the stripped-down version of the Gemini spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|A Company—now under Lieutenant Lawrence Clark {{following}} Chitts' wounding that afternoon—had {{only just}} succeeded in breaking contact from the Chinese, suffering a number killed and wounded during a confused withdrawal. Meanwhile, B Company {{had also been}} forced to fight its way down the hill. Both companies were now well clear of their former positions and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> hard time fighting their way back. Ultimately {{it was too late}} for the Australians to regain the feature in darkness, and the weight of the Chinese attack continued to mount. Only D Company on the southern right flank—which had been left unmolested—was able to regain its previous position on Hill 63. Meanwhile, the positions previously occupied by A and B Companies were occupied by the Chinese in superior numbers, and the remainder of 3 RAR concentrated at the railway crossing instead. At 22:00 Coad arranged to shell and mortar the relinquished ridge, while a standing patrol from the Middlesex was posted on the south-western side of the Maenjung-dong pass in anticipation of a renewed Chinese attack. However, following heavy fighting the pressure on the Australians unexpectedly ceased after midnight, and parties of Chinese were observed beginning to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|An online version, Black & White: The Gathering, was in development, {{and would}} have enabled creatures to {{interact}} those of other players in a cut-down game environment over the internet. Lionhead planned to release Black & White: The Gathering {{two months before the}} main game's release as a free download, and it was to offer a choice of creatures. It would have linked with chat programs such as AOL instant messenger and ICQ and convert text to a speech bubble from the creature. It was intended for players to be able to upload the main game's creature into Black & White: The Gathering and its experiences to be saved into the main game. Another online program, Black & White Worlds, was in development. This would have taken place in the worlds of the main game. Molyneux explained that there was to be a server, whose worlds would have been set up with a match-making system and players {{would have been able to}} do battle, like last man standing. There was also a plan to produce Black & White Universe, in which players <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> persistent online world.|$|E
50|$|Typically a {{child and}} the parents will sue a doctor or a {{hospital}} for failing {{to provide information about}} the disability during the pregnancy, or a genetic disposition before the pregnancy.

25|$|Then, Tarba {{experienced}} a Roman colonisation and acquired ancient villas and large agricultural estates, found {{particularly in the}} Ormeau quarter.
