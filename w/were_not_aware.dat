5|$|Ricketts and {{the other}} {{settlers}} living in the area <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> of the glens and their waterfalls until about 1865, when they were discovered {{by two of the}} Ricketts' guests who went fishing and wandered down Kitchen Creek. In 1872 Ricketts built a three-story wooden addition to the stone house; this opened as the North Mountain House hotel in 1873, and was run by Ricketts' brother Frank until 1898.|$|E

5|$|A 2005 {{survey found}} that 68% of American flex-fuel car owners <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> they owned an E85 flex. This was because the exteriors of flex and non-flex {{vehicles}} look exactly the same; there is no sale price difference between them; the lack of consumers' awareness about E85s; and also the initial decision of American automakers of not putting any kind of exterior labeling, so buyers could be unaware they are purchasing an E85 vehicle. Since 2008, all new FFV models in the US feature a bright yellow gas cap to remind drivers of the E85 capabilities and proper flex-fuel badging.|$|E
5|$|In the match, Zimbabwe batted first, and {{the public}} at the ground <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> of the protest until the 22nd over, when Flower came out to bat wearing a black armband. Olonga was also seen wearing a black armband on the Zimbabwe team balcony. The crowd of 4,000 at the ground were {{supportive}} of the protest, {{and a number of}} them made their own black armbands during the match. In the match itself, Flower scored 39, as Zimbabwe reached 340/2, and Olonga took 0/8 in 3 overs, as Zimbabwe won a rain-affected match by 86 runs (D/L method).|$|E

5|$|Speidel {{met with}} former foreign {{minister}} Konstantin von Neurath and Strölin on 27 May in Germany, ostensibly at Rommel's request, although {{the latter was}} not present. Neurath and Strölin suggested opening immediate surrender negotiations with the West, and, according to Speidel, Rommel agreed to further discussions and preparations. However, {{around the same time}} the plotters in Berlin <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> that Rommel had reportedly decided {{to take part in the}} conspiracy. On 16 May, they informed Allen Dulles, through whom they hoped to negotiate with the Western Allies, that Rommel could not be counted on for support.|$|E
5|$|The coup was {{organised}} {{with the}} help of some VNQDĐ and Đại Việt members, civilians and officers alike. Đông enlisted the cooperation of an armoured regiment, marine unit and three paratrooper battalions. The marine battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Pham Van Lieu. The operation was scheduled to launch on November 11 at 05:00. However, the airborne soldiers <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> of what their officers had in store. They were told that they were heading into the countryside to attack the Viet Cong. Once they were on their way, the officers claimed that the Presidential Guard, who were meant to guard the presidential palace, had mutinied against Diệm.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{accident}} {{did not result}} in a large number of deaths, it exposed major stewardship shortcomings of the privatised national railway infrastructure company Railtrack. Reports found {{there was a lack of}} communication and some staff <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> of maintenance procedures. Railtrack subsequently went into administration and was replaced by Network Rail. The aftermath of {{the accident}} saw widespread speed limit reductions throughout the rail network and a tightening of health and safety procedures, the repercussions of which were still felt up to 15 years later. In 2005, both Network Rail and the contractor Balfour Beatty were found guilty of breaching health and safety laws.|$|E
5|$|Following {{enquiries}} by the media, Paramount and Namco {{released a}} joint statement explaining {{that it was an}} issue with the Steam system, and was something that the company was seeking to fix shortly. While others stated issues with co-op gameplay on the PS3, the companies stated that they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> of any issues and recommended that faults should be reported via Twitter. After the PC issue was rectified, a further statement was published to alert customers that they could now use this type of gameplay. A day after the co-op issues with Star Trek were resolved, the Dead Island: Riptide problems were also corrected, with speculation by reviewers presuming that it was the same error in both games.|$|E
5|$|For his part, Minh resented that he {{had been}} deposed by a younger officer whom he viewed as an unscrupulous upstart. Minh was also upset with the {{detention}} of his fellow generals and around 30 of his junior officers. The latter group was set free when Minh made this a condition for his serving as the figurehead chief of state. Khánh attempted to avoid the issue of substantiating the alleged neutralist plot {{for as long as he}} could, and then tried to revive it by claiming that French agents were attempting to assassinate him and to enforce neutralism. Khánh offered no evidence, only claiming that the French had paid a hitman US$1300 to kill him, before later inflating the supposed reward for his assassination. American intelligence officials in Vietnam privately said that they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> of any such threat.|$|E

5|$|In {{southern}} Madagascar, the cyclone produced {{high winds}} and heavy rainfall. The highest rainfall was a 24‑hour total of , {{and the highest}} wind gust was , both of which observed in Toliara. Many fishermen in the area <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> of the storm's approach, and several of them died as a result. About five days after Cyclone Ernest struck Madagascar, Tropical Storm Felapi struck the same general area, causing additional flooding. The combined effects of Ernest and Felapi killed 39people, injured 104, and left 214people missing as of February25, 2005. Later, the death toll was finalized at 78 in the International Disaster Database. The storms damaged 5,792buildings, and there were 32,191people left homeless. The floods damaged about 4,483hectares (11,078acres) of crop fields in southern Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|On {{the west}} side of the Naktong, North Korean Major General Pak Kyo Sam, {{commanding}} the NK 9th Division, issued his operations order to the division on August 28. Its mission in the forthcoming attack was to outflank and destroy the US troops at Naktong Bulge by capturing the Miryang and Samnangjin areas to cut off the US 2nd Division's route of supply and withdrawal between Taegu and Pusan. However, the North Koreans <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> that the US 2nd Infantry Division had recently replaced the US 24th Infantry Division in positions along the Naktong River. Consequently, they expected lighter resistance; the 24th troops were exhausted from months of fighting but the 2nd Division men were fresh and newly arrived in Korea. They had only recently been moved into the line. The North Koreans began crossing the Naktong River under cover of darkness at certain points.|$|E
5|$|The AFIS air {{controller}} has {{a different}} role in Norway than in Russia, and the crew <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> {{that they were being}} given information and advice, rather than orders. Communication with AFIS was left with the navigator, which is a breach of norms. Communication between air control and the crew was problematic, since the crew lacked sufficient English skills. The pilot in command had insufficient crew resource management. After the crew decided to carry out the approach to Runway 28, a new approach briefing was not accomplished. The aircraft overshot the approach centerline when turning inbound, because they did not try to intercept the outbound track from Advent. The crew showed a lack of situational awareness following their uncertainty of the aircraft position in relation to LLZ 28, caused by indications on the HSIs.|$|E

5|$|There {{were two}} {{other reasons for}} the Syrian withdrawal. The 3rd Battalion from the Palmach's Yiftach Brigade had been sent by boat during the {{previous}} night across the sea to Ein Gev, planning to assault and capture Kafr Harib. It was, noticed and shelled by the Syrians, {{but one of the}} companies managed to climb up the Golan. It carried out a smaller raid at dawn, bombing water carriers and threatening the Syrian 1st Brigade's line of communications. The second reason was that they were running out of ammunition: Husni al-Za'im had been promised replenishment, and attacked Degania short of ammunition. Za'im ordered a withdrawal when his troops ran out of ammunition. The replenishment was instead sent to the 2nd Brigade further north. The Israelis <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> of this, and attributed the Syrian withdrawal to surprise at the Israeli artillery fire.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the day on 20 July, Dean {{ordered the}} {{headquarters}} of the 34th Infantry to withdraw. His command was reinforced by several more light tanks from the 1st Cavalry Division. As the tanks fought through a North Korean roadblock, Dean, with a small force of soldiers, followed them. At the edge of the city, the final elements of the 34th Infantry, leaving the city in 50 vehicles, were ambushed and many of their vehicles were destroyed by machine guns and mortars, forcing the Americans to retreat on foot. In the ensuing fight, Dean's jeep made a wrong turn and was separated from the rest of the American forces. Unable to turn back, Dean and his party attempted to retreat to American lines on their own, but 35 days later, alone and lost in the hills, Dean was captured by North Korean forces. For most of his incarceration, the North Koreans <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> of his rank. Dean repeatedly attempted to make the North Koreans kill him for fear of divulging information under torture. North Korean leaders had threatened to harm Dean if he did not cooperate but he was never actually tortured. Eventually his rank was uncovered, but they were unable to gather any intelligence from him.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November Soviet forces {{began to}} cross the Don River and {{continued}} their advance towards the town of Kalach. German forces defending Kalach, mostly composed of maintenance and supply personnel, <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>aware</b> of the Soviet offensive until 21 November, and even then did not know in what strength the Red Army was approaching. The task of taking the bridge at Kalach {{was given to the}} Soviet 26th Tank Corps, which used two captured German tanks and a reconnaissance vehicle to approach it and fire on the guards. Soviet forces broke into the town by mid-morning and drove the defenders out, allowing themselves and the 4th Tank Corps to link up with the Red Army's 4th Mechanized Corps approaching from the south. The encirclement of German forces in Stalingrad was completed on 22 November 1942. That day Soviet formations also continued to fight pockets of Romanian resistance, such as that put up by the Romanian 5th Corps.|$|E
