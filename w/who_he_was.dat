His {{drumming}} continues to be praised by critics and musicians. He was posthumously inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 1982, becoming only the second rock drummer to be chosen, and in 2011, Moon was voted the second-greatest drummer in history by a Rolling Stone readers' poll.|$|E

5|$|The duty officer, Captain Thomas Selvester, began {{a routine}} interrogation. Himmler {{admitted}} <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> and Selvester had the prisoner searched. Himmler {{was taken to}} the headquarters of the Second British Army in Lüneburg, where Doctor Wells conducted a medical exam on him. The doctor attempted to examine the inside of Himmler's mouth, but the prisoner was reluctant to open it and jerked his head away. Himmler then bit into a hidden cyanide pill and collapsed onto the floor. He was dead within 15 minutes. Shortly afterward, Himmler's body was buried in an unmarked grave near Lüneburg. The grave's location remains unknown.|$|E

5|$|The tall {{stranger}} {{says that}} he who draws the sword from the trunk shall receive it as a gift, and he {{who is able to}} pull free the sword shall never carry a better sword than it. The old man leaves the hall, and nobody knows <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> or where he went. Everyone stands, trying their hand at pulling free the sword from the trunk of Barnstokkr. The noblest attempt to pull free the sword first followed by those ranked after them. Sigmund, son of King Völsung, takes his turn, and—as if the sword had lay loose for him—he draws it from the trunk. The saga then continues.|$|E

5|$|As a boy Smith {{trained with}} Millwall, Sheffield United, {{who had a}} base in Amersham, and Watford, <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> with {{until the age of}} 12. After only playing for Comets Sports club in Sunday league {{football}} for two years, he was given a chance by his father at Watford in a county trial at the age of 14 and signed with them again. Manager Graham Taylor gave Smith his debut for Watford on 18 November 1997, bringing him on as a substitute in a 2–1 Second Division win over Oldham Athletic. Smith did not play another league game in 1997–98, but made eight appearances for Watford as they qualified for the play-offs in the 1998–99 season, where the club gained promotion to the Premiership. He established himself in the team during the club's first Premier League season, making 23 appearances and scoring two goals, including one at Vicarage Road against Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|Franz Stangl was a {{supervisor}} at the Hartheim Euthanasia Centre, part of Action T4, an early Nazi euthanasia programme that {{was responsible for}} the deaths of over 70,000 mentally ill or physically deformed people in Germany. In February 1942, he was commander at the Sobibor extermination camp and in August of the same year he was transferred to Treblinka. During his time at these camps, he oversaw the deaths of nearly 900,000 people. While in U.S. detention for two years, he remained unidentified as a war criminal because so few witnesses had survived Sobibor and Treblinka that authorities never realised <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> He escaped while on a roadwork detail in Linz in May 1948. After he made his way to Rome, the Caritas relief agency provided him with a Red Cross passport and a boat ticket to Syria. His family joined him there a year later and they emigrated to Brazil in 1951.|$|E
5|$|In January 1776, Allen and his {{men were}} put on board HMS Soledad, which sailed for Cork, Ireland. The people of Cork, when they learned that the famous Ethan Allen was in port, took up a {{collection}} to provide him {{and his men}} with clothing and other supplies. Much of the following year was spent on prison ships off the American coast. At one point, while aboard HMS Mercury, she anchored off New York, where, among other visitors, the captain entertained William Tryon; Allen reports that Tryon glanced at him without any sign of recognition, although it is likely the New York governor knew <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> In August 1776, Allen and other prisoners were temporarily put ashore in Halifax, owing to extremely poor conditions aboard ship; due to food scarcity, both crew and prisoners were on short rations, and scurvy was rampant. By the end of October, Allen was again off New York, where the British, having secured the city, moved the prisoners on-shore, and, as he was considered an officer, gave Allen limited parole. With the financial assistance of his brother Ira, he lived comfortably, if out of action, until August 1777. He then learned {{of the death of}} his young son Joseph due to smallpox.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s British {{intelligence}} {{learned that the}} ANO held accounts with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) in London. BCCI was closed in July 1991 by banking regulators in six countries after evidence emerged of widespread fraud. Abu Nidal himself {{was said to have}} visited London using the name Shakar Farhan; a BCCI branch manager, who passed information about the ANO accounts to MI5, reportedly drove him around several stores in London without realizing <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> Abu Nidal was using a company called SAS International Trading and Investments in Warsaw as cover for arms deals. The company's transactions included the purchase of riot guns, ostensibly for Syria, then when the British refused an export licence to Syria, for an African state; in fact half the shipment went to the police in East Germany and half to Abu Nidal.|$|E
5|$|John Cena and Randy Orton {{continued}} their feud over the WWE Championship, {{as the two}} were scheduled {{to compete in a}} Last Man Standing match for the title. The match, however, never occurred. On the October 1 episode of Raw, Cena defeated Mr. Kennedy in a non-title match. After the match, Orton attacked Cena and then counted to ten, which Cena was unable to answer to. Cena was legitimately injured in the match, and as a result, the following night on ECW on Sci Fi, Mr. McMahon vacated the WWE Championship because Cena's right pectoral tendon was legitimately torn while executing a hip toss during his match with Kennedy. At No Mercy, Mr. McMahon entered the ring and said that a new WWE Champion was to be crowned, and Orton was crowned as champion, but he was challenged by Triple H for the title on the spot. Triple H, however, defeated Orton to win the WWE Championship, but later that same night, Triple H lost the title to Orton back in a Last Man Standing match after a title defense against Umaga, <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> booked to face in a standard wrestling match.|$|E
5|$|Some misguided Hollywood {{press agent}} sought to alter Como's life story by {{changing}} his previous occupation from barber to coal miner, claiming {{it would make}} for better press. Fred Othman, a Hollywood columnist, publicly stated that he believed Como the barber was just a publicity gimmick. Perry gave him a shave and haircut at the Fox Studios barber shop to prove him wrong. In 1985, Como related {{the story of his}} first film role experience in Something for the Boys. He sat ready to work in his dressing room for two weeks without being called. Perry spent the next two weeks playing golf, still not missed by the studio. It was five weeks before he was actually called to the set, despite the studio's initial urgent report for work notice. When Como finally appeared, the director had no idea <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{two main}} {{characters}} are Miranda, and the laughing man (Marcus). Stead began writing When You Reach Me in 2007 after reading {{an article in}} The New York Times gave her {{an idea for a}} novel about traveling in time to save someone's life. The article was about a man who woke up in Denver suffering from amnesia, having forgotten <b>who</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> or why he was there. Many people worked with the man to help him regain his memory. Under hypnosis, he spoke about his apparent wife, Penny, and two daughters who died in a car crash. However, when he and Penny reunited, the man found out she was only his fiancée— and they had no children. Upon reading this, Stead wondered if somehow the man had returned to the past to prevent an accident but lost his memory along the way. In addition, the article reminded Stead of a strange old man, called the 'laughing man', who lived near her house as a child.|$|E
