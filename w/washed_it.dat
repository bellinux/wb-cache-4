5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{first brought}} rainfall to coastal parts of Georgia and South Carolina. Strong winds were reported along coastal areas of North Carolina, with sustained winds peaking at 72mph (116km/h) at Kitty Hawk. Winds reached 54mph (87km/h) at Cape Henry, Virginia, {{and the combination}} of the winds and rough surf washed some boats ashore. The schooner Beatrice was lost near Chincoteague with a crew of 30; 28people on board were killed. A squall line destroyed the front mast of a schooner near Cape Henry. Several boats broke free from their moorings near Salisbury and were subsequently destroyed after passing downstream. The schooner Hattie A. Marsh encountered strong winds from the hurricane along the Delaware coast, while strong waves <b>washed</b> <b>it</b> ashore the rocky coastline. The boat was wrecked and the rooms onboard were washed overboard, killing five members of the crew. Two people were rescued after conditions calmed, one of whom was injured and taken to a hospital.|$|E

25|$|On {{the ninth}} day, Changing Woman felt her birth labor begin. Talking God appeared, {{carrying}} a rope of sunbeam. Water Sprinkler the Rain God appeared carrying a rope of rainbow. Saying nothing, the two beings gave {{one end of}} each rope to Changing Woman and silently bid her pull them with each spasm of labor. This began the custom of giving a rope {{to a woman who}} is in labor. A baby boy emerged, and Talking God took it aside and <b>washed</b> <b>it,</b> and severed its cord. A second baby boy emerged, and Water Sprinkler took it aside and <b>washed</b> <b>it</b> and severed its cord.|$|E

25|$|Haridasa Thakur in Gaudiya Vaishnavism is {{believed}} to be a combined incarnation of Brahma Mahatapa, the son of Richika Muni and Prahlada. The respected Murari Gupta has written in his Chaitanya Charitamrita that this sage’s son picked a tulasi leaf and offered it to Krishna without having <b>washed</b> <b>it</b> first. His father then cursed him to become a mleccha in his next life. He was thus born as Haridasa, a great devotee.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} common rules {{on how to}} treat the flag respectfully. The flag must not be dirty or damaged. The flag must never touch the ground. When the flag is <b>washed,</b> <b>it</b> must be dried indoors. A {{worn-out}} flag must be disposed of by burning (though not {{with the intent to}} disgrace it), or alternatively by cutting it to pieces small enough not to be recognizable as parts of the flag. The flag must not be buried in the ground or the sea (including not throwing it into the garbage).|$|E
25|$|In 1965, Togawa {{spoke with}} a local hunter {{who claimed to have}} killed a large cat with fur like a tiger's. He {{disposed}} of the body, and Haemi on {{the southern part of the}} island, where the body was disposed of, was searched. The hunter said that, until ten days prior to the interview, the cat's skeleton was still where he had left it, but the recent rains had <b>washed</b> <b>it</b> away. He described that cat as having a shoulder height that reached an adult human's knee, a tail that was 60 centimeters long, a body twice as large as a house cat's, and greenish striped fur.|$|E

500|$|Less {{than a month}} later, on August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina {{tore the}} casino barge from its {{moorings}} and <b>washed</b> <b>it</b> ashore ½ mile west of the Broadwater Resort Marina. [...] The barge was a total loss, it was cut up as scrap and removed by a salvage company. [...] (The new Silver Slipper Casino would be built {{from the ground up}} instead and open in late 2006.) [...] The hotel in the resort part was still standing but heavily damaged by Katrina, with the storm surge reaching the second floor. [...] The famed sign was destroyed. The marina too was wrecked and closed. [...] The golf course did not reopen. [...] The hotel subsequently underwent demolition, which concluded by November 2006 with even the foundation slabs removed.|$|E
500|$|In 1867, {{prison labour}} from Adelaide Gaol {{was used to}} build a wooden dam {{near the site of}} the current weir. The dam was poorly {{constructed}} and almost immediately the Torrens <b>washed</b> <b>it</b> away. Construction of a permanent concrete weir was begun in November 1880 and completed, at a cost of £7,000, in 1881. The sluice gates were closed to begin filling the [...] Torrens Lake on 1 July 1881. At the lake's official opening on 21 July 1881 an estimated 40,000, almost the entire population of Adelaide, attended. During the 1889 flood, the weir was overwhelmed, its gates jammed, and in trying to free them the weir's designer John Langdon was crippled. The weir was rebuilt from 1928 to 1929 with its footbridge relocated and the centre section replaced. The gates can now be fully raised and the river allowed to flow unimpeded.|$|E
500|$|SR94 {{was built}} along the routing {{of an old}} stagecoach road {{that was part of}} the primary road from San Diego to Yuma, Arizona. A trip to East County in the 19th century along the road would last two days. James Pascoe {{surveyed}} the route through Campo for the county in 1869 that was [...] shorter than the existing route through Warner's Pass. The road was known for its curves, climbs, and boulders, making travel difficult. The first automobile went on the road in 1904. By 1913, an unpaved automobile road extended to Campo from San Diego, and work took place to improve the condition of the road in 1916. A year later, the road continued east to join with the state highway leading into Imperial County. In 1927, the Potrero bridge was replaced, after a storm <b>washed</b> <b>it</b> out. By 1928, the paving of the Campo road was about 43percent complete. In February of the next year, the progress was at 74percent; the total cost was $122,474 (about $ in [...] dollars). The Sweetwater bridge was finished in March at a cost of $60,000 (about $ in [...] dollars). The Campo road was the only road through the Peninsular Ranges to stay open for the entirety of the next winter; other roads were closed due to snow, leading to increased traffic along this road. This was largely due to the lower elevation of the road, at only [...]|$|E

2500|$|The {{origin of}} the legend of El Dorado (Spanish for [...] "The Golden One") in the early 16th century may {{be located in the}} Muisca Confederation. The zipa used to offer gold and other treasures to the Guatavita goddess. To do so, the zipa covered himself with gold dust and <b>washed</b> <b>it</b> off in the lake while tossing gold {{trinkets}} into the waters. This tradition was well-known outside the Confederation, as far as the Caribbean Sea; the Spaniards were attracted by the stories of a [...] "city of gold" [...] that actually did not exist. Indigenous people sometimes got rid of the avaricious Spaniards in that way, pointing them in the direction of other peoples. Lake Guatavita was widely explored by the Conquistadors, looking for gold offerings from the zipa to the goddess. The legend grew until the term became a metaphor for any place where great wealth may be found or made.|$|E
