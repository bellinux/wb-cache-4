5|$|In {{the same}} year, Coca-Cola wanted Selena {{to become one}} of their spokespeople in Texas. The jingle used in her first two {{commercials}} for the company were composed by A.B. and Chris Pérez—the latter of whom had joined Selena y Los Dinos several months earlier as the band's new guitarist. Pérez began having romantic feelings for Selena, despite having a girlfriend in San Antonio. After a trip down to Mexico with the band, Pérez thought it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> them both to distance himself from her, but he found that impossible and chose to try to build a relationship with her. They expressed their feelings for each other at a Pizza Hut restaurant, and shortly afterwards became a couple. Pérez and Selena hid their relationship, fearing Quintanilla, Jr. would try to break it up.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{began the}} 2013–14 {{season in the}} {{starting}} eleven under yet another new manager, Kenny Jackett, but soon lost his place amid competition from new signing Kevin McDonald and two younger midfielders, Lee Evans and Jack Price. On his last start for Wolves, on 16 November, he was reportedly fortunate not to be sent off before being substituted at half-time. Thereafter he played only 54 minutes of first-team football as the team were promoted back to the Championship at the first attempt, and although Jackett insisted that {{he still had a}} future at the club, Davis became frustrated. Ahead of the new season, Jackett suggested that, as there were at least four players more likely than Davis to be selected, a loan move <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> him. Barnsley of League One were interested, but terms could not be agreed.|$|E

The Hamburg Massacre in July, although limited in fatalities compared to the total from later incidents at Ellenton, Charleston and Cainhoy, persuaded many whites that Governor Chamberlain's administration was unable to maintain order. In most of these events, blacks were killed in much greater number than whites, particularly at Ellenton. Populist Democrats ended hopes of supporting fusion with the Republicans, and the Straighouts became the dominant force within the Democratic Party.|$|E

25|$|R.A. Kartini {{loved her}} father deeply, {{although}} {{it is clear that}} her deep affection for him became yet another obstacle to the realization of her ambitions. He was progressive enough to allow his daughters schooling until the age of twelve, but at that point firmly closed the door to further schooling. In his letters, her father also expressed his affection for Kartini. Eventually, he gave permission for her to study to become a teacher in Batavia (now Jakarta), although previously he had prevented her from cral of her pen friends worked on her behalf to support Kartini in this endeavour. Many of her friends expressed their disappointment when Kartini's ambition was finally thwarted. In the end, her plans to study in the Japan were changed into plans to journey to Tokyo, on the advice of Mrs. Abendanon that this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> R.A.

While creating the new album, Streisand recorded two new tracks that were made specifically for the project: [...] "We're Not Makin' Love Anymore" [...] and [...] "Someone That I Used to Love". The song was first released in the United States on September 14, 1989 by Columbia Records, while the album was released on October 3 of that same year.|$|E

Caretaker Rev. Christopher Steck, S.J. was surprised by the schools decision, and published a letter expressing his disappointment. In an editorial in The Hoya, Steck also lamented the school's choice not to involve the Bulldog Advisory Committee, which began meeting earlier in the summer, in its decision. After a search by Steck, J.J. was adopted by a family close to the Georgetown campus on August 18, 2013.|$|E

500|$|In 1899, the Isthmian Canal Commission {{was set up}} to {{determine}} which site <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> the canal (Nicaragua or Panama) and then to oversee construction of the canal. After Nicaragua was ruled out, Panama was the obvious choice. A few problems had arisen, however. With the U.S.' solidified interests in Panama (then a small portion of Colombia), both Colombia and the French company that was to provide the construction materials raised their prices. The U.S., refusing to pay the higher-than-expected fees, [...] "engineered a revolution" [...] in Colombia. On November 3, 1903, Panama (with the support of the United States Navy) revolted against Colombia. Panama became a new republic, receiving $10 million from the U.S. alone. Panama also gained an annual payment of $250,000, and guarantees of independence. The U.S. gained the rights to the canal strip [...] "in perpetuity". Roosevelt later said that he [...] "took the Canal, and let Congress debate". After Colombia lost Panama, they tried to appeal to the U.S. by the reconsidering of treaties and even naming Panama City the capital of Colombia.|$|E
500|$|Many {{leaders of}} the G20 {{disagreed}} about which issues should be discussed at the summit. The prime focus of the summit discussions was the recovery from the ongoing global recession and the European debt crisis. Summit leaders were divided over which strategies <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> tackling these problems. The European Union emphasized the need to cut their deficits by focusing on austerity measures. [...] In contrast, the United States {{emphasized the importance of}} maintaining economic stimulus spending in order to encourage growth. In summit discussions, the countries of the European Union explained projected reductions in spending and balanced budgets. [...] Alternatively, China, India, and the United States argued in favor of increased stimulus funding to mitigate the effects of recession. Among the specifics proposed by the European Union were a global bank tax and a Robin Hood tax, but the United States and Canada opposed these plans. Other topics of concern were international development and continuing international aid to Africa and other developing nations. [...] Some invitees expressed criticism of Israel's Gaza strip blockade and of the nuclear programs of North Korea and the United States raised issues of corruption and security in Afghanistan.|$|E
500|$|During the concepting {{process of}} Halo 4, O'Connor decided it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> the {{franchise}} {{to explore the}} Forerunner fiction of the Halo universe, which had remained largely a mystery before 343 Industries' involvement in the franchise. This ultimately {{led to the creation}} of a new race of enemy, the Prometheans, warriors of the Forerunner empire. Given that the Forerunners themselves had never been featured in previous Halo games, the design process for the appearance of the Prometheans was long and tedious. [...] The art team produced a large number of sketches, which were presented to other member's of the studio to get feedback and reactions. Many variations of different character models were concepted before the team decided on a final design. The main goal when designing their appearance was to make them resonate with the player, and evoke the image of the Forerunner architecture and language that had been portrayed in previous Halo media. Upon death, the Promethean Knight dissolves from the point where it was last shot; this visual effect also occurs when certain enemies are killed by Promethean weapons. From a gameplay standpoint the design for the Prometheans also needed to fit in well with the sandbox so they would be suitable enemies to fight. A goal when designing their behaviour was to make them highly adaptive from a tactical standpoint. For example, the Promethean Knight can phase in and out of space, allowing it to retreat or charge the player at any given moment; this changes the way that a player engages in a combat encounter.|$|E

500|$|Howarth {{said he had}} {{no desire}} to portray a {{redeemed}} Todd, and that the show would be better off finding [...] "a Todd who won't object to the material." [...] He subsequently left the series for a year. In the October 24, 1995 Soap Opera Digest issue, he stated:In the beginning, the character of Todd was successful. I'll always be proud of this story, because it {{was the result of a}} real team effort. It was one of those spectacular times when the writer, producer, director, grips, engineers and actors were all on the same wavelength. Everybody was working toward a common goal. My task, at the time, was to show the humanity of someone who was basically inhuman. Todd wasn't one-dimensional, but he was definitely a serious psychopath. Todd was a serial rapist. He raped Carol Swift. Then, he raped Marty Saybrooke, and that rape was brutal, intense, violent and realistic. There were innuendos he had raped other women before. He stalked Nora, he stalked and tried to rape Luna. [...] Linda Gottlieb told me with reasonable certainty that [...] would not try to redeem Todd. So, I didn't think the character would change. Then about a year ago, it became clear to me they were taking the character on a different path—they were redeeming him. In my mind, I'd been hired to play Todd Manning, a very realistic, serious psychopath. But now, the powers-that-be wanted me to play Todd Lord. And the story of Todd Lord is not realistic—it's a fairy tale. I thought, [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>best</b> <b>for</b> the show if I were to leave."
