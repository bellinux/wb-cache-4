5|$|The <b>weakness</b> from LEMS {{typically}} {{involves the}} muscles of the proximal arms and legs (the muscles closer to the trunk). In contrast to myasthenia gravis, the <b>weakness</b> affects the legs more than the arms. This leads to difficulties climbing stairs and rising from a sitting position. <b>Weakness</b> is often relieved temporarily after exertion or physical exercise. High temperatures can worsen the symptoms. <b>Weakness</b> of the bulbar muscles (muscles of the mouth and throat) is occasionally encountered. <b>Weakness</b> of the eye muscles is uncommon. Some may have double vision, drooping of the eyelids and difficulty swallowing, but generally only together with leg weakness; this too distinguishes LEMS from myasthenia gravis, in which eye signs are much more common. In the advanced stages of the disease, <b>weakness</b> of the respiratory muscles may occur. Some may also experience problems with coordination (ataxia).|$|E
5|$|An attack often {{begins with}} muscle pain, cramping, and stiffness. This is {{followed}} by <b>weakness</b> or paralysis that tends to develop rapidly, usually in late evening or {{the early hours of}} the morning. The <b>weakness</b> is usually symmetrical; the limb muscles closer to the trunk (proximal) are predominantly affected, and <b>weakness</b> tends to start in the legs and spread to the arms. Muscles of the mouth and throat, eyes, and breathing are usually not affected, but occasionally <b>weakness</b> of the respiratory muscles can cause life-threatening respiratory failure. Attacks typically resolve within several hours to several days, even in the absence of treatment. On neurological examination during an attack, flaccid <b>weakness</b> of the limbs is noted; reflexes are usually diminished, but the sensory system is unaffected. Mental status is not affected.|$|E
5|$|Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} (GBS) is a rapid-onset muscle <b>weakness</b> {{caused by}} the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system. The initial symptoms are typically changes in sensation or pain along with muscle <b>weakness,</b> beginning in the feet and hands. This often spreads to the arms and upper body with both sides being involved. The symptoms develop over hours to a few weeks. During the acute phase, the disorder can be life-threatening with about 15% developing <b>weakness</b> of the breathing muscles requiring mechanical ventilation. Some are affected by changes in {{the function of the}} autonomic nervous system, which can lead to dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure.|$|E

40|$|The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) {{was passed}} to improve {{corporate}} responsibility through measures that strengthen internal controls and increase accountability. We hypothesize that companies reporting internal control <b>weaknesses</b> will have weaker financial performance {{because of the}} required expenditures to correct internal control <b>weaknesses</b> and disruptions to operations. Next, we hypothesize that the impact size on financial performance varies with the categories of internal control <b>weaknesses.</b> In particular, we distinguish between information technology (IT) controls and other controls. Our results provide evidence that material IT control <b>weaknesses</b> reported in conjunction with SOX 404 audits are associated with significantly lower financial performance than other control <b>weaknesses.</b> Of the 20 material IT control <b>weaknesses</b> reported in conjunction with 2004 and 2005 SOX 404 audits, security control <b>weaknesses</b> are most strongly associated with reduced financial performance. We also investigate whether IT governance mechanisms reduce the likelihood that firms will report material IT control <b>weaknesses</b> and thereby contribute to firm financial performance...|$|R

5|$|The first {{symptoms}} of Guillain–Barré syndrome are numbness, tingling, and pain, {{alone or in}} combination. This is followed by <b>weakness</b> of the legs and arms that affects both sides equally and worsens over time. The <b>weakness</b> can take half a day to over two weeks to reach maximum severity, and then becomes steady. In one in five people, the <b>weakness</b> continues to progress {{for as long as}} four weeks. The muscles of the neck may also be affected, and about half experience involvement of the cranial nerves which supply the head and face; this may lead to <b>weakness</b> of the muscles of the face, swallowing difficulties and sometimes <b>weakness</b> of the eye muscles. In 8%, the <b>weakness</b> affects only the legs (paraplegia or paraparesis). Involvement of the muscles that control the bladder and anus is unusual. In total, about a third of people with Guillain–Barré syndrome continue to be able to walk. Once the <b>weakness</b> has stopped progressing, it persists at a stable level ("plateau phase") before improvement occurs. The plateau phase can take between two days and six months, but the most common duration is a week. Pain-related symptoms affect more than half, and include back pain, painful tingling, muscle pain and pain {{in the head and neck}} relating to irritation of the lining of the brain.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{association}} between firms' Section 302 and Section 404 internal control <b>weaknesses</b> and these firms' cash-to-cash flow sensitivities. We also examine whether {{the presence of the}} internal control <b>weaknesses</b> affects the relationship between firms' asset liquidity and stock liquidity. We find that the presence of Section 404 internal control <b>weaknesses</b> is associated with stronger cash-to-cash flow sensitivities and with weaker impact of higher asset liquidity on stock liquidity. Our results suggest that internal control <b>weaknesses</b> increase firms' reliance on internal, as opposed to external, financing. Also, internal control <b>weaknesses</b> increase uncertainty over future uses of cash, thereby reducing the positive impact of higher relative cash balances on stock liquidity. Thus, our study provides additional evidence on the potential costs of internal control <b>weaknesses.</b> cash policies; internal control weaknesses; asset liquidity; stock liquidity; cash-to-cash flow; cash balances...|$|R

Finally, hemorrhage from an AVM may lead to intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain), which causes any of the symptoms of stroke such as <b>weakness</b> in part of the body or difficulty speaking.
