40|$|With the {{continued}} miniaturisation of portable embedded systems, wireless EEG recording techniques {{are becoming increasingly}} prevalent in animal behavioural research. However, {{in spite of their}} versatility and portability, they have seldom been used inside water-maze tasks designed for rats. As such, a novel 3 D printed implant and <b>waterproof</b> <b>connector</b> is presented, which can facilitate wireless water-maze EEG recordings in freely-moving rats, using a commercial wireless recording system (W 32; Multichannel Systems). As well as waterproofing the wireless system, battery, and electrode connector, the implant serves to reduce movement-related artefacts by redistributing movement-related forces away from the electrode connector. This implant/connector was able to successfully record high-quality LFP in the hippocampo-striatal brain regions of rats as they undertook a procedural-learning variant of the double-H water-maze task. Notably, there were no significant performance deficits through its use when compared with a control group across a number of metrics including number of errors and speed of task completion. Taken together, this method can expand the range of measurements that are currently possible in this diverse area of behavioural neuroscience, whilst paving the way for integration with more complex behaviours...|$|E

5000|$|Reliability {{issues have}} caused {{previous}} electronic systems {{to be withdrawn}} from the market. As of recently, all electronic group sets are fully <b>waterproof.</b> External <b>connectors</b> are completely <b>waterproof,</b> but internal <b>connectors</b> (internal routing for wired systems) need to be shrink wrapped with shrink tubing to be waterproof.|$|R
50|$|Hermetic vs. Water-Proof vs. Water-Resistant {{refers to}} the {{coupling}} seal between the contacts, connector insert and body. A true hermetic connector provides an airtight seal and can support and maintain positive pressure or a vacuum. <b>Waterproof</b> <b>connectors</b> prevent liquid ingress when immersed {{using a variety of}} methods (e.g., molding, potting and encapsulating) to prevent water intrusion at high hydrostatic pressures. Water resistant implies that a coupled connector will prevent water ingress that can lead to shorting in shallow standing water or rain. Typically this is achieved by inserting rubber gaskets and compression seals at the contract region {{as well as at the}} cable entry.|$|R

Wildz To reduce the field effort required for 2 -D and 3 -D shallow seismic surveying, we have developed a towed land-streamer system. It was constructed with self-orienting gimbal-mounted geophones housed in heavy (1 kg) cylindrical casings, sturdy seismic cables with rein-forced kevlar sheathing, robust <b>waterproof</b> <b>connectors,</b> and a reinforced rubber sheet that helped prevent ca-ble snagging, maintained geophone alignment, and pro-vided additional hold-down weight for the geophones. Each cable had takeouts for 12 geophones at 1 m or 2 m intervals. By {{eliminating the need for}} manual geophon...|$|R

[...] The Nanostation M3 and M365 {{are in a}} molded weatherproof case with 13.7 dBi dual polarization antennas. The Rocket M3, M365 and M365 GPS are in a rugged case using a hi-power, very linear 2x2 MIMO radio with 2x RP-SMA (<b>Waterproof)</b> <b>connectors.</b> [...] Finally the NanoBridge M3 and M365 for long range PtP connections. [...] These devices use N mode Atheros chipsets along with Ubiquiti's airMax TDMA protocol to overcome the hidden node problem which is commonly an issue when using ptmp wireless outdoors. UBNT currently does not allow sales to U.S. Amateurs and only sell these radios under FCC License. [...] This {{may be due to}} exclusion areas near coasts and US Navy installations. [...] The 3.5GHz band is currently used for DoD or Navy (shipborne and ground based) radar operations and covers 60 percent of the U.S. population.
