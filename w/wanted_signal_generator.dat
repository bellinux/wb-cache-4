A lot of advantages are included in it, such as simple circuit, simple regulation and convenience maintenance. It can completely be used in industrial instrumentation and automatic testing area. Waveform <b>signal</b> <b>generator</b> is also called function generator, it can generate some certain periodic function signals, such as sine wave, square wave, saw tooth wave and triangular wave, its frequency range can be raised from several mill hertz or micro hertz to scores of megahertz. In industrial environment, this function <b>signal</b> <b>generator</b> is usually used in the area of instrument and auto control system testing; meanwhile, it is also widely used in non electric testing. Usually, we classify <b>signal</b> <b>generator</b> by various waveform signals. By different outputting waves, <b>signal</b> <b>generator</b> can be divided into sine wave <b>generator,</b> function <b>signal</b> <b>generator,</b> pulse <b>signal</b> <b>generator</b> and random <b>signal</b> <b>generator.</b> But function <b>signal</b> <b>generator</b> is the widest one in use, and it is also the common one, because it can output various kinds of waves to satisfy the need we <b>want.</b> Meanwhile, its <b>signal</b> frequency range is wider than others.

RF {{and microwave}} <b>signal</b> <b>generators</b> normally have similar features and capabilities, but are differentiated by frequency range. RF <b>signal</b> <b>generators</b> typically range from a few kHz to 6 GHz, while microwave <b>signal</b> <b>generators</b> cover a much wider frequency range, from less than 1 MHz to at least 20 GHz. Some models go as high as 70 GHz with a direct coaxial output, and up to hundreds of GHz when used with external waveguide source modules. RF and microwave <b>signal</b> <b>generators</b> can be classified further as analog or vector <b>signal</b> <b>generators.</b>|$|R

Older {{network analyzer}}s {{did not have}} their own <b>signal</b> <b>generator,</b> but {{had the ability to}} control a stand-alone <b>signal</b> <b>generator</b> using, for example, a GPIB connection. Nearly all modern network analyzers have a built-in <b>signal</b> <b>generator.</b> High-performance network analyzers have two built-in sources. Two built-in sources are useful for applications such as mixer test, where one source provides the RF signal, another the LO, or amplifier intermodulation testing, where two tones are required for the test.|$|R

50|$|With {{the advent}} of digital {{communications}} systems, {{it is no longer}} possible to adequately test these systems with traditional analog <b>signal</b> <b>generators.</b> This has {{led to the development of}} the vector <b>signal</b> <b>generator,</b> which is also known as a digital <b>signal</b> <b>generator.</b> These <b>signal</b> <b>generators</b> are capable of generating digitally-modulated radio signals that may use any of a large number of digital modulation formats such as QAM, QPSK, FSK, BPSK, and OFDM. In addition, since modern commercial digital communication systems are almost all based on well-defined industry standards, many vector <b>signal</b> <b>generators</b> can generate <b>signals</b> based on these standards. Examples include GSM, W-CDMA (UMTS), CDMA2000, LTE, Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11), and WiMAX (IEEE 802.16). In contrast, military communication systems such as JTRS, which place a great deal of importance on robustness and information security, typically use very proprietary methods. To test these types of communication systems, users will often create their own custom waveforms and download them into the vector <b>signal</b> <b>generator</b> to create the desired test signal.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, a parsimoniously {{parameterized}} {{digital predistorter}} is derived for linearization of the IQ modulation mismatch and the amplifier imperfection in the <b>signal</b> <b>generator</b> [1]. It is {{shown that the}} resulting predistorter is linear in its parameters, and thus they may be estimated by the method of least-squares. Spectrally pure signals are an indispensable requirement when the <b>signal</b> <b>generator</b> {{is to be used}} as part of a test bed. Due to the non-linear characteristic of the IQ modulator and power amplifier, distortion will be present at the output of the <b>signal</b> <b>generator.</b> The device under test was the IQ modulation mismatch and power amplifier deficiencies in the <b>signal</b> <b>generator.</b> In [2], the dynamic range of low-cost <b>signal</b> <b>generators</b> are improved by employing model based digital pre-distortion and the designed predistorter seems to give some improvement of the dynamic range of the <b>signal</b> <b>generator.</b> The goal of this project is to implement and verify the theory parts [1] using data program (Matlab) to improve the dynamic range of the <b>signal</b> <b>generator.</b> The design digital pre-distortion that is implemented in software so that the dynamic range of the <b>signal</b> <b>generator</b> output after predistortion is superior to that of the output prior to it. In this project, we have observed numerical problems in the proposed theory and we have found other methods to solve the problem. The polynomial model is commonly used in power amplifier modeling and predistorter design. However, the conventional polynomial model exhibits numerical instabilities when higher order terms are included, we have used the conventional and orthogonal polynomial models. The result shows that the orthogonal polynomial model generally yield better power amplifier modeling accuracy as well as predistortion linearization performance then the conventional polynomial model...|$|R
