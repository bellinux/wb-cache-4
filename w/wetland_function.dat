40|$|AbstractWetland plant litter {{decomposition}} influences many wetland {{processes and}} is itself {{driven by a}} complex web of interacting parameters. Invertebrates and fungi make up one portion of that web by processing organic material; however, their role is poorly understood. To explore invertebrate and fungal influence on plant litter decomposition rate, we measured the decomposition of litter in three mitigated (created wetlands) and three reference wetlands in the Mid-Atlantic Highlands of West Virginia, USA. Litter decomposition rates and most invertebrate metrics were not statistically different between mitigated and reference wetlands; only oligochaetes (worms) and the functional feeding group (FFG) collector/gatherers had numbers that were statistically higher in mitigated wetlands. Invertebrate metrics were able to explain 25 % (FFG) to 31 % (taxonomic groups) of variance during {{the first phase of}} decomposition (< 224 days) and 15 % (FFG) to 21 % (taxonomic groups) during the second phase (≥ 224 days). Shredders, collector/gatherers, and omnivores were more strongly associated with early phases of decomposition, while oligochaetes and omnivores were most strongly associated with trends in decomposition during the later phase. Fungal biomass, as measured by ergosterol concentration, was similar between mitigated and reference wetlands and was significantly higher in the first phase of litter decomposition than the second phase, but was not statistically correlated with litter decomposition rate.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an introduction to}} the Wetlands and Human Health special issue and an overview of the papers. It identifies the disjunct that can exist between managing wetland health and human health. There is a need to resolve the potential conflict between managing wetlands for their values and managing them for positive human health outcomes. All authors have used the Ramsar definition of wetlands and the World Health Organization definition of human health. The papers (several are reviews) cover a range of wetlands and diseases from mosquitoborne to snail or pathogen vectors. Mosquito management is a common theme, illustrating, for the eastern USA, that wetland damage from the early to mid twentieth century can be ameliorated by careful restoration and, for Australia, that damage may be avoided. Constructed wetlands provide an opportunity to create ecosystem services and wetland value such that careful design and operation can minimise mosquito risks.

40|$|M. Sc. (Aquatic Health) Abstract: Wetlands are {{amongst the}} most {{productive}} ecosystems in the natural world. Important biogeochemical and hydrological functions, such as nutrient cycling and organic carbon sequestration, {{are the result of}} a wetlands ability to moderate groundwater flow. Colbyn Valley is an urban wetland in the heart of Pretoria, South Africa that has been under threat due to urban development and pressure from Tshwane City Council. The wetland contains a 4. 68 ha component of peatland that is up to 2. 4 m deep in places, which is a valuable ecological resource that requires protection. Weirs have been built to restore the <b>wetland</b> <b>function</b> and prevent degradation by erosion, yet no monitoring had been conducted to determine the success of the restoration measures. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine if rewetting of drained channelled valley bottom wetlands by weirs creates a back flooding effect, thereby raising the groundwater flow in the wetland. <b>Wetland</b> <b>function</b> was determined by means of hydrogeomorphological classification, soil profile analysis, and hydrodynamics. Hydrodynamics is a hypothetical field based method that requires the use of flow nets or models to determine flow dynamics in the system. Isotope analysis confirms the hydrological movement as illustrated by flow models, whereas flow duration curves represent the relationship between stream flow and adjacent sites. Peat accumulation commenced 2360 years BP during the mid-late Holocene period. LiDAR images indicated the lack of significant channelling taking place at the lowest point, therefore, clearly the Colbyn Valley was originally an unchannelled system. Although monitoring well water levels follow rainfall patterns, it was noted that in the first part of the study period that there was a delayed response to rainfall, most likely due to the high clay content of the soils, reducing permeability. The rain isotope signatures were different from the wells and piezometers, indicating that the main source for the system originated from the groundwater aquifer. During the wet season, isotope signatures indicated that the wetland and stream water were not related. The point at the peatland was the most depleted section, with groundwater being exposed to evaporation when reaching the surface. Enrichment of water during the wet season was indicative of base flow maintenance, an essential function of wetlands. The flow dynamics within the peat section could not be thoroughly examined but geological maps indicating a diabase dyke could account for the inconsistencies in flow dynamics. The repairs at weir 3 had a positive effect on water levels in adjacent sites, by raising the levels with more than 60 cm. When equating the water [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Peatlands {{represent}} {{the largest single}} global store of soil carbon. Despite providing a natural long-term CO 2 sink, drainage and conversion to agricultural and silivicultural management of peatlands has converted them into large net contributors to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (~ 2. 5 % of all anthropogenic emissions, primarily from Europe and SE Asia). Drainage-based agriculture on peatlands is intrinsically unsustainable, causing oxidative loss of soil organic matter and land-subsidence, which ultimately reduce or negate their value for agriculture. Returning all drained peatlands to their natural <b>wetland</b> <b>function</b> could make a substantial contribution to reducing global GHG emissions, but socio-economic factors – namely the high realisable income from drained agricultural peatlands, intensifying demand for land in regions with growing populations, and lack of adequate financial incentives for conserving or restoring natural peatlands – make such an outcome unlikely in the short to medium term. We therefore consider the potential climate mitigation benefits of the adoption of an interim move towards ‘responsible peatland management’, which seeks to minimise GHG emissions from areas under ongoing agricultural use via the implementation of higher water level management strategies and alternative crops. We also discuss the possibility to create ‘future carbon sinks’ by restoring degraded agricultural peatlands to peat-forming systems...|$|E
40|$|Water and {{emergent}} vegetation are {{key features}} influencing nest site selection and success for many marsh-nesting waterbirds. Wetland management {{practices such as}} grazing, burning, and water-level manipulations directly affect these features and can influence nest survival. We used model selection and before-after-control-impact approaches to evaluate the effects of water depth and four common land-management practices or treatments, i. e., summer grazing, fall grazing, fall burning, and idle (no active treatment) on nest survival of American coots (Fulica americana) nesting at Grays Lake, a large montane wetland in southeast Idaho. The best model included the variables year × treatment, and quadratic functions of date, water depth, and nest age; height of vegetation at the nest did not improve the best model. However, results from the before-after-control-impact analysis indicate that management practices affected nest success via vegetation and involved interactions of hydrology, residual vegetation, and habitat composition. Nest success in idled fields changed little between pre- and post-treatment periods, whereas nest success declined in fields that were grazed or burned, with the most dramatic declines the year following treatments. The importance of water depth may be amplified in this wetland system because of rapid water-level withdrawal during the nesting season.
