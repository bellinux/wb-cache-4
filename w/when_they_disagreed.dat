25|$|Sinha and Richards both {{argue that}} the south only used states' rights <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>disagreed</b> with a policy. Examples given are a states' right to engage in slavery or to {{suppress}} freedom of speech. They argue that it was instead {{the result of the}} increasing cognitive dissonance in the minds of Northerners and (some) Southern non-slaveowners between the ideals that the United States was founded upon and identified itself as standing for, as expressed in the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, and the Bill of Rights, and the reality that the slave-power represented, as what they describe as an anti-democratic, counter-republican, oligarchic, despotic, authoritarian, if not totalitarian, movement for ownership of human beings as the personal chattels of the slaver. As this cognitive dissonance increased, the people of the Northern states, and the Northern states themselves, became increasingly inclined to resist the encroachments of the slave power upon their states' rights and encroachments of the slave power by and upon the federal government of the United States. The slave power, having failed to maintain its dominance of the federal government through democratic means, sought other means of maintaining its dominance of the federal government, by means of military aggression, by right of force and coercion, and thus, the Civil War occurred.|$|E

In order to make him eligible for the imperial throne and to enable him {{to vote in the}} imperial elections as elector of Bohemia (which she could not do because of her gender), Maria Theresa made Francis Stephen co-ruler of the Austrian and Bohemian lands on 21November 1740. [...] It took more than a year for the Diet of Hungary to accept Francis Stephen as co-ruler. Despite her love for him and his position as co-ruler, Maria Theresa never allowed her husband to decide matters of state and often dismissed him from council meetings <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>disagreed.</b>|$|E
500|$|Back at the Krusty Krab, Plankton {{comes in}} and disagrees with Mr. Krabs' story and tells SpongeBob his own version. His story {{is the same as}} Mr. Krab's, except that their roles during the fight at the end are reversed, with Krabs wanting to rule the money of the {{children}} and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>disagreed</b> shot Plankton out of a straw into the dump. Plankton and Krabs begin arguing about the story, until Karen arrives and tells the real story. In the story, the restaurant initially has no customers, and Old Man Jenkins, an elderly resident and an old friend of Krab's family, is the first to try their burger, but collapses, having been poisoned by the patty. Krabs and Plankton become angry and accuse each other of tainting the patty. They begin fighting over the recipe, eventually tearing it in two. Their friendship over, Plankton storms out to pursue his own career in food. However, during the struggle, a shelf was knocked down, dumping various ingredients into the patty batter, creating the Krabby Patty recipe, which Krabs is left with. The two go their separate ways, each trying to open their own establishment. Mr. Krabs' [...] "Krabby Patty" [...] became a success, while Plankton's Chum Burger is horrible.|$|E

60|$|And is it {{reasonable}} {{to suppose that}} after Wolsey was conquered, and a comparatively popular ministry had succeeded, and that memorable Parliament of 1529 (which Mr. Froude, not unjustly, thinks more memorable than the Long Parliament itself) began its great work with a high hand, backed not merely by the King, but by the public opinion {{of the majority of}} England, their decisions are likely to have been more servile than before? If they resisted the King <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>disagreed</b> with him, are they to be accused of servility because they worked with him when they agreed with him? Is an Opposition always in the right; a ministerial party always in the wrong? Is it an offence against the people to agree with the monarch, even when he agrees with the people himself? Simple as these questions are, one must really stop to ask them.|$|E

40|$|Disagreement is {{considered}} {{as an act}} that threatens someone's positive face. In this case, one is supposed to consider whom she talks to and in what situation. There are some factors that influence people in expressing disagreement such as ethnic background between the speaker and the interlocutor. From these factors, the writer is interested in analyzing disagreement, particularly about what kinds of linguistic choices that are used the most in expressing disagreement. The data {{of this study were}} taken from questionnaires distributed to 10 educated Chinese Indonesian and 10 educated Javanese from EF (English First). The data were categorized based on Garcia 's classification (1989) concerning confrontational and non confrontational devices. From the analysis, the writer found out that two of non confrontational devices, that is "Giving reason" is used the most by educated Chinese Indonesian <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>disagree</b> to the addressee. They tend to give reason as its functions to explain why <b>they</b> <b>disagree.</b> The second one is "Downtoned suggestions". It is frequently used by educated Javanese <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>disagree</b> to the addressee. They tend to give suggestion as its functions to help each other in solving the problem...|$|R

Reportedly pressured by Universal executives, Hitchcock wanted a score that was more jazz- and pop-influenced. Hitchcock's biographer, Patrick McGilligan, stated that Hitchcock was worried about becoming old-fashioned and felt that Herrmann's music had to change with the times as well. Herrmann initially accepted the offer, but then decided to score the film according to his own ideas.|$|E

The government was generally run by the rich plantation owners who already had enough land and just wanted to avoid conflict, so the poor free men rebelled by holding the House of Burgesses hostage.

In the 1ESS's 3B20, two computers performed each step, checking each other. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>disagreed,</b> they would diagnose themselves, and the correctly running computer would take up switch operation while the other would disqualify itself and request repair. The 1ESS switch was still in limited use as of 2012, and had a verified reliability of less than one unscheduled hour of failure in each thirty years of operation, validating its design.|$|E

40|$|As multi-agent systems proliferate {{and employ}} {{different}} {{and more sophisticated}} formal logics, it is increasingly likely that agents will be reasoning with different rules of inference. Hence, an agent seeking to convince another of some proposition may first have to convince the latter to use a rule of inference which it has not thus far adopted. We define a formalism to represent degrees of acceptability or validity of rules of inference, to enable autonomous agents to undertake dialogue concerning inference rules. Even <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>disagree</b> over the acceptability of a rule, two agents may still use the proposed formalism to reason collaboratively. ...|$|R
