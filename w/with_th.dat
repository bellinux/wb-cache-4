5|$|Thored {{may be the}} Thored {{who appears}} {{for the first time}} in charter {{attestations}} during the reign of King Edgar (95975), his earliest possible appearance being in 964, witnessing a grant of land in Kent by King Edgar to St Peter's, Ghent. This is uncertain because the authenticity of this particular charter is unclear. A charter issued by Edgar in 966, granting land in Oxfordshire to a woman named Ælfgifu, has an illegible ealdorman witness signature beginning <b>with</b> <b>Þ,</b> which may be Thored.|$|E

2500|$|In ethics, he was broadly utilitarian; however, he {{preferred}} the term [...] "teleological" [...] since the term [...] "utilitarian" [...] suggested that all goods were instrumental {{and he believed}} (with, e.g., H.W.B. Joseph and W.D. Ross) that some experiences were intrinsically good. He also denied that pleasure is the sole good, maintaining instead (<b>with</b> <b>T.H.</b> Green) that experiences are good as wholes and that pleasure is not, strictly speaking, a separable element within such wholes. Disagreeing with G.E. Moore that the [...] "naturalistic fallacy" [...] is really a fallacy, he gave an entirely naturalistic analysis of goodness, holding that an experience is intrinsically good {{to the degree that}} it (a) fulfills an impulse or drive and (b) generates a feeling-tone of satisfaction attendant upon such fulfillment. He regarded the first of these factors as by far the more important and held that the major intrinsic goods of human experience answer to the basic drives of human nature; he maintained that these two factors together provide not merely a criterion for but the actual meaning of intrinsic goodness. (He defined all other ethical terms, including [...] "right", in terms of intrinsic goodness, a right act, for example, being that act which tends to produce the greatest amount of intrinsic goodness under the relevant circumstances.) ...|$|E
