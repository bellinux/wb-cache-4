5|$|Despite the {{conditions}} set out by Tikhon's decree for this temporary autonomy not being met, the American diocese of the Russian church declared self-governance in 1924, against the protests of the patriarchate, with <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> communication {{and which was}} capable of governance had its American branch been willing. The refusal of the American branch {{to submit to the}} patriarchate thus based itself officially on a document whose conditions it had not met. In reality, however, it was a fear of Communism and a belief that the patriarchate had been compromised which fueled the rebellion, paired with a desire {{on the part of the}} Metropolia to dissociate itself from the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) of <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been part.|$|E

The crisis was brought to an official end by the Thirty Years' Peace (winter of 446–445BC), in which Athens relinquished most of the possessions and interests on the Greek mainland <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> acquired since 460BC, and both Athens and Sparta agreed not to attempt {{to win over the}} other state's allies.|$|E

5|$|In 1632, Sigismund III Vasa, {{the king}} of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, died. Russia, having {{recovered}} {{to a certain extent}} from the Time of Troubles, decided to capitalize on the temporary confusion of its western neighbor. Russia's aim was to gain control of Smolensk, <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> ceded to the Commonwealth in 1618 at the Truce of Deulino, ending the last Russo-Polish War. Smolensk was the capital of the Commonwealth's Smoleńsk Voivodeship, but it had often been contested, and it changed hands many times during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries (from the days of the Muscovite-Lithuanian Wars).|$|E

5|$|Roy E. Halling {{designated}} a lectotype specimen in 1983 from Frost's original collections. Early molecular evidence {{suggested that the}} lilac-brown bolete was genetically distinct from the genera in <b>which</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> formerly been placed. In 2012, Halling and colleagues published molecular evidence indicating that the species did not belong in either Tylopilus or Leccinum as it does not share a recent common ancestor with either of those genera. Recognizing its genetic and morphological distinctiveness, they created the genus Sutorius, with S.eximius as the type species. As of 2015, the only other species in Sutorius is S.australiensis, found in Australia.|$|E
