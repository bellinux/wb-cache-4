2500|$|On February 24, 2009, Jindal {{delivered}} the official Republican response to President Obama's address {{to a joint}} session of Congress.

[...] "Today in Washington, some are promising that government will rescue us from the economic storms raging all around us," [...] Jindal said. [...] "Those of us who lived through Hurricane Katrina, we have our doubts." [...] He praised the late sheriff Harry Lee for standing up to the government during Katrina. The speech met with biting reviews from some members of both the Democratic and the Republican parties. Referring to Jindal as [...] "devoid of substantive ideas for governing the country", political commentator Rachel Maddow summarized Jindal's Katrina remark as follows: [...] " [...] since government failed during Hurricane Katrina, we should understand, not that government {{should not be allowed to}} fail again, but that government...never works. That government can't work, and therefore <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>stop</b> seeking a functioning government." [...] David Johnson, a Republican political strategist criticized Jindal's mention of Hurricane Katrina, stating [...] "The one thing Republicans want to forget is Katrina." [...] While Jindal's speech was poorly received by several Democratic and Republican critics, others argued that the speech should be judged on substance rather than delivery style.|$|E

2500|$|In Budapest, Prónay {{installed}} {{his unit}} in the Hotel Britannia, where the group swelled to battalion size. Their program of vicious attacks continued; they planned a citywide pogrom against the Jews until Horthy found out and {{put a stop to}} it. In his diary, Prónay reported that Horthy:reproached me for the many Jewish corpses found in the various parts of the country, especially in the Transdanubia. This, he emphasized, gave the foreign press extra ammunitions against us. He told me that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>stop</b> harassing small Jews; instead, we should kill some big (Kun government) Jews such as Somogyi or Vázsonyi – these people deserve punishment much more... in vain, I tried to convince him that the liberal papers would be against us anyway, and it did not matter that we killed only one Jew or we killed them allThe degree of Horthy's responsibility for the excesses of Prónay is disputed. On several occasions, Horthy reached out to stop Prónay from a particularly excessive burst of anti-Jewish cruelty, and the Jews of Pest went on record absolving Horthy of the White Terror as early as the fall of 1919, when they released a statement disavowing the Kun revolution and blaming the terror on a few units within the National Army. Horthy has never been found to have personally engaged in White Terror atrocities. [...] But his American biographer, Thomas L. Sakmyster, concluded that he [...] "tacitly supported the right wing officer detachments" [...] who carried out the terror; Horthy called them [...] "my best men". The admiral also had practical reasons for overlooking the terror his officers wrought, since he needed the dedicated officers to help stabilize the country. Nevertheless, it was at least another year before the terror died down. In the summer of 1920, Horthy's government took measures to rein in and eventually disperse the reactionary battalions. Prónay managed to undermine these measures, but only for a short time. Prónay was put on trial for extorting a wealthy Jewish politician, and for [...] "insulting the President of the Parliament" [...] by trying to cover up the extortion. Found guilty on both charges, Prónay was now a liability and an embarrassment. His command was revoked, and he was denounced as a common criminal {{on the floor of the}} Hungarian parliament.|$|E
