5000|$|The term {{diffusion}} pressure deficit (DPD) {{was coined}} by B.S Meyer in 1938. Originally DPD {{was described as}} suction pressure by Renner (1915). It is reduction in the diffusion pressure of water in solution or cell over its pure state due to presence of solutes in it and forces opposing diffusion. Diffusion pressure of water is maximum and its theoretical value is 1236 atm. DPD of a solution is equal to its osmotic pressure i.e. DPD = OP(of solution). DPD of a cell isinfluence by both osmotic pressure and <b>wall</b> <b>pressure</b> (turgor pressure) which opposes the endosmotic entry of water, i.e. DPD = OP - <b>Wall</b> <b>pressure.</b> DPD is directly proportional to the concentration of the solution. DPD decreases with dilution of solution.The actual pressure with which cell absorbs water is called [...] "suction pressure".|$|E

A wall jet follows a flat horizontal wall, say of infinite radius,or rather whose radius is the radius of the Earth without separation because the surface pressure {{as well as the}} external pressure in the mixing zone is everywhere equal to the atmospheric pressure and the boundary layer does not separate from the wall.With a much smaller radius (12 centimeters in the image on the right) a transverse difference arises between external and wall surface pressures of the jet, creating a pressure gradient depending upon h/r, the relative curvature. This pressure gradient can appear in a zone before and after the origin of the jet where it gradually arises, and disappear {{at the point where the}} jet boundary layer separates from the wall, where the <b>wall</b> <b>pressure</b> reaches atmospheric pressure (and the transverse gradient becomes zero).|$|E
5000|$|Starting {{from the}} {{principle}} of conservative design, the engineer typically considers two worst case trajectories, the undershoot and overshoot trajectories. The overshoot trajectory is typically defined as the shallowest allowable entry velocity angle prior to atmospheric skip-off. The overshoot trajectory has the highest heat load and sets the TPS thickness. The undershoot trajectory {{is defined by the}} steepest allowable trajectory. For manned missions the steepest entry angle is limited by the peak deceleration. The undershoot trajectory also has the highest peak heat flux and dynamic pressure. Consequently, the undershoot trajectory is the basis for selecting the TPS material. There is no [...] "one size fits all" [...] TPS material. A TPS material that is ideal for high heat flux may be too conductive (too dense) for a long duration heat load. A low density TPS material might lack the tensile strength to resist spallation if the dynamic pressure is too high. A TPS material can perform well for a specific peak heat flux, but fail catastrophically for the same peak heat flux if the <b>wall</b> <b>pressure</b> is significantly increased (this happened with NASA's R-4 test spacecraft). [...] Older TPS materials tend to be more labor-intensive and expensive to manufacture compared to modern materials. However, modern TPS materials often lack the flight history of the older materials (an important consideration for a risk-averse designer).|$|E

40|$|A recent {{research}} program has identified {{the possibility of}} using the analysis of casing <b>wall</b> <b>pressures</b> in the direct measurement of gas turbine rotor blade vibration amplitudes. Currently the dominant method of non-contact measurement of gas turbine blade vibrations employs the use of a number of proximity probes located around the engine periphery measuring the blade tip (arrival) time (BTT). Despite the increasing ability of this method there still exist some limitations, viz: the requirement {{of a large number of}} sensors for each engine stage, sensitivity to sensor location, difficulties in dealing with multiple excitation frequencies and sensors being located in the gas path. Analytical modelling of the casing <b>wall</b> <b>pressures</b> and reconstruction of rotor blade vibration amplitudes from the analysis of these simulated pressure signals has shown significant improvement over current non-contact rotor blade vibration measurement limitations by requiring only a limited number of sensors and providing robust rotor blade vibration amplitude estimates in the presence of simulated measurement noise. However, this modelling was conducted with some fundamental assumptions about the casing <b>wall</b> <b>pressures</b> being made. One of these assumptions presumed that during blade motion the pressure profile around the rotor blades follows the blade’s motion while it oscillates around its equilibrium position. This assumption is investigated in this paper through the numerical modelling of the fully coupled two-way rotor blade motion and fluid pressure interaction...|$|R

The measurements were made using miniature hearing aid type condenser microphones with spanwise separations of 0 ?, 10 ?, 20 ?, 30 ?, 60 ?, and 90 ?. An improved <b>wall</b> <b>pressure</b> power spectrum was obtained at low frequencies by utilizing a two-point subtraction method to remove low frequency acoustic background noise of the wind tunnel.

The minimum <b>wall</b> <b>pressure</b> coefficient of an orifice plate can indirectly reflect its cavitation characteristics: the lower the minimum <b>wall</b> <b>pressure</b> coefficient is, the better {{the ability of the}} orifice plate to resist cavitation damage is. Thus, it is important to study the minimum <b>wall</b> <b>pressure</b> coefficient of the orifice plate. In this study, this coefficient and related parameters, such as the contraction ratio, defined as the ratio of the orifice plate diameter to the flood-discharging tunnel diameter; the relative thickness, defined as the ratio of the orifice plate thickness to the tunnel diameter; and the Reynolds number of the flow through the orifice plate, were theoretically analyzed, and their relationships were obtained through physical model experiments. It can be concluded that the minimum <b>wall</b> <b>pressure</b> coefficient is mainly dominated by the contraction ratio and relative thickness.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. To {{ascertain}} {{the effect of}} aneurysm thrombus and luminal diameter on arterial blood pressure within the abdominal aortic aneurysm lumen and at the sac wall. Methods. A life-like abdominal aortic aneurysm was incorporated in a pulsatile flow unit, using systemic blood pressure settings of 140 / 100 mmHg and 130 / 90 mmHg (denoted {{the high and low}} settings, respectively). Aneurysm sac pressure was measured in the absence of thrombus within the sac. This was repeated after a thrombus analogue (gelatine) was introduced into the aneurysm model in an asymmetric fashion. Luminal and sac <b>wall</b> <b>pressures</b> were compared to the systemic pressure, and to each other, in both blood pressure settings. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA in Minitab 13. Results. In the empty sac, the luminal and sac <b>wall</b> <b>pressures</b> were identical to the systemic pressures at the high and low settings. After introduction of thrombus, pressure was transmitted in a monophasic pulsatile fashion, measuring 166 / 142 / 151 mmHg (SP/DP/MP) at the sac wall, while the corresponding intraluminal pressure was 164 / 136 / 145 mmHg (p< 0. 001, high setting). By contrast, in the low setting, these readings were 157 / 133 / 141 (sac wall) and 160 / 128 / 138 mmHg (lumen; p< 0. 001). The sac <b>wall</b> <b>pressures</b> were significantly higher than the luminal pressures for both high and low settings (p< 0. 001). Conclusions. Thrombus has a significant effect on the intraaneurysmal lumen itself and causes localised hypertension with high intraluminal pressures. The differences between the sac wall/luminal pressures may affect regional aneurysm wall biomechanics, but needs further study...|$|R
