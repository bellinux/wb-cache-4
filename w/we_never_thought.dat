If it gets $100million, we'll both make money. But if it's a real blockbuster and earns $200million or so at the box office, we'll make good money, and Disney will {{make a lot of}} money." [...] Upon its release on November 22, 1995, Toy Story managed to gross more than $350million worldwide. Disney chairman Michael Eisner stated [...] "I don't think either side thought Toy Story would turn out as well as it has. The technology is brilliant, the casting is inspired, and I think the story will touch a nerve. Believe me, when we first agreed to work together, <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> their first movie would be our 1995 holiday feature, or that they could go public on the strength of it." [...] The film's first five days of domestic release (on Thanksgiving weekend) earned it $39,071,176. The film placed first in the weekend's box office with $29,140,617 and maintained the [...] 1 position at the domestic box office for the next two weekends. Toy Story became the highest-grossing domestic film of 1995, beating Batman Forever, Apollo 13 (also starring Tom Hanks), Pocahontas, Casper, Waterworld, and GoldenEye. At the time of its release, it was the third highest-grossing animated film of all time, after The Lion King (1994) and Aladdin (1992). When not considering inflation, Toy Story is [...] 96 on the list of the highest-grossing domestic films of all time. The film had gross receipts of $191,796,233 in the U.S. and Canada and $181,757,800 in international markets for a total of $373,554,033 worldwide. At the time of its release, the film ranked as 17th highest-grossing film (unadjusted) domestically and it was the 21st highest-grossing film worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|Holbrooke {{was born}} on April 24, 1941, in New York City, to Dan Holbrooke, a doctor, and Trudi Kearl (née Moos), a potter; brother, Andrew, survives him. Holbrooke's mother, whose Jewish family fled Hamburg in 1933 for Buenos Aires before coming to New York, took him to Quaker {{meetings}} on Sundays. She stated: “I was an atheist, his father was an atheist... <b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> of giving Richard a Jewish upbringing. The Quaker meetings seemed interesting.” ...|$|E

Foote also used Forrest as a major character in his novel Shiloh which used numerous first-person stories to illustrate a detailed timeline and account of the battle.|$|E

2500|$|Foote labored to {{maintain}} his objectivity in the narrative despite his Southern upbringing. He did not deliberately avoid Lost Cause mythologizing in his work. He developed new respect for such disparate figures as Ulysses Grant, William T. Sherman, Patrick Cleburne, Edwin Stanton and Jefferson Davis. By contrast, he grew to dislike such figures as Phil Sheridan and Joe Johnston. He considered United States President Abraham Lincoln and Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest to be two authentic geniuses of the war. When he stated this opinion in conversation with one of General Forrest's granddaughters, she replied after a pause, [...] "You know, <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> much of Mr. Lincoln in my family." ...|$|E
2500|$|That {{is such a}} {{difficult}} question. There are times when certain people are blessed—and cursed—with an extraordinary gift, in which the gift is almost greater than the human being. Callas {{was one of these}} people. It was as if her own wishes, her life, her own happiness were all subservient to this incredible, incredible gift that she was given, this gift that reached out and taught us things about music that we knew very well, but showed us new things, things <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> about, new possibilities. I think that is why singers admire her so. I think that's why conductors admire her so. I know it's why I admire her so. And she paid a tremendously difficult and expensive price for this career. I don't think she always understood what she did or why she did it. She usually had a tremendous effect on audiences and on people. But it was not something she could always live with gracefully or happily. I once said to her [...] "It must be a very enviable thing to be Maria Callas." [...] And she said, [...] "No, it's a very terrible thing to be Maria Callas, because it's a question of trying to understand something you can never really understand." [...] She couldn't really explain what she did. It was all done by instinct. It was something embedded deep within her.|$|E
2500|$|Stan has a {{large amount}} of {{on-screen}} interaction with his family, living at the centre of the family, The Queen Victoria when he permanently arrives on Albert Square. Stan is shown to have an estranged relationship with his eldest daughter, Shirley Carter, played by Linda Henry, with West saying there is [...] "tension" [...] between father and daughter and that makes Stan [...] "very wary of her." [...] Despite this, Stan has a good relationship with his youngest daughter, Tina Carter, played by Luisa Bradshaw-White, and West felt that they had the [...] "best relationship out of the lot of them". West also said how Stan enjoys the warmth and kindness that Tina provides. West felt Stan was [...] "delighted" [...] to see 'son' Mick Carter, played by Danny Dyer, again, even though they slightly avoided each other. Mick blames Stan for [...] "things that have gone wrong to him - as well as things that he doesn't know about, things that he is confused about and things he's unhappy about." [...] Dyer praised West and his role as Stan, saying [...] "Tim has brought something to the part that <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> he would." [...] West revealed in an interview with Claire Webb of Radio Times that he originally hated his on-screen family, but [...] "now absolutely adores them". When Stan meets Mick's children - Johnny and Nancy, played by Sam Strike and Maddy Hill, in April, he manages to insult Johnny's sexuality, which Johnny does not take well to. Speaking of the meeting, West said: [...] "He likes Johnny but can't really cope with the fact he is gay, but after an initial, very rude couple of outbursts about both Tina and Johnny being gay, he warms to them both." [...] West said that Stan's relationship with his ex-wife, Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe), was [...] "stormy". Marlowe said that Sylvie's arrival is a [...] "big shock" [...] for him because [...] "one minute she's saying something like wanting to run away with him and the next minute she's saying, 'Who?'" ...|$|E

60|$|But without {{question}} the ablest prose {{of the period}} came from the pen of Cromwell's Latin Secretary of State, John Milton. Milton stands {{in his own time}} a peculiarly isolated figure. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> in <b>thought</b> associate him with his contemporaries. Dryden had become the leading literary figure in London before Milton wrote his great epic; yet, were it not for definite chronology, we should scarcely realize that they worked in the same century. While, therefore, no sketch of seventeenth-century literature can exclude Milton, he must be taken by himself, without relation to the development, forms, and spirit of his age, and must be regarded, rather, as a late-born Elizabethan.|$|R
