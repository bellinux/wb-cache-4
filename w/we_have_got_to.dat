500|$|Hand was {{increasingly}} {{called upon to}} judge cases arising from the flood of New Deal legislation. The line between central government authority and local legislation particularly tested his powers of judgment. In 1935, the case of United States v. Schechter came before the Second Circuit. Hand and his two colleagues had to judge whether a New York poultry firm had contravened New Deal legislation on unfair trade practices. They ruled that the National Industrial Recovery Act {{did not apply to}} the Schechter Poultry Corporation, which traded solely within the state. [...] "The line is no doubt in the end arbitrary," [...] Hand wrote in a memorandum, [...] "but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> draw it, because without it Congress can take over all the government." [...] The Supreme Court later affirmed Hand's decision.|$|E
500|$|Another {{writer who}} left the show during season two was David Gerrold. He wrote an episode for The Original Series called [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles" [...] and came {{on-board}} The Next Generation before the pilot and wrote {{the first version of}} the bible for the series. Rick Berman stated in an early memo that the new series was intended to be an issues-based show in the same mold as the original. Creator Gene Roddenberry concurred, and under questioning from fans at a convention which Gerrold also attended, Roddenberry agreed {{that it was time for}} a homosexual character to appear in Star Trek. Roddenberry told his staff that [...] "Times have changed and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be aware of it." [...] This resulted in Gerrold pitching a story called [...] "", which included two homosexual crew members and an AIDS allegory. Roddenberry cleared the idea to be produced into a script, and Gerrold went off to appear on a Star Trek cruise having received a telegram telling him that everyone in the office was pleased with the new story.|$|E

[...] He added: [...] "There is no yellow card offence between a warning and disqualification". [...] Oxford coach Sean Bowden blamed the defeat on the restart: [...] "We rowed with a lot of courage ... but having to restart after that great first take-off really hurt us.

500|$|The American Youth Congress {{was formed}} in 1935 to {{advocate}} for youth rights in U.S. politics, and was responsible for introducing the American Youth Bill of Rights to the U.S. Congress. Roosevelt's relationship with the AYC {{eventually led to the}} formation of the National Youth Administration, a New Deal agency in the United States, founded in 1935, that focused on providing work and education for Americans between the ages of 16 and 25. The NYA was headed by Aubrey Willis Williams, a prominent liberal from Alabama who was close to Roosevelt and Harry Hopkins. Speaking of the NYA in the 1930s, Roosevelt expressed her concern about ageism, stating that [...] "I live in real terror when I think we may be losing this generation. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> bring these young people into the active life of the community and make them feel that they are necessary." [...] In 1939 the Dies Committee subpoenaed leaders of the AYC, who, in addition to serving the AYC, also were members of the Young Communist League. Roosevelt was in attendance at the hearings and afterward invited the subpoenaed witnesses to board at the White House during their stay in Washington D.C. Joseph P. Lash was one of her boarders. On February 10, 1940, members of the AYC, as guests of Roosevelt in her capacity as First Lady, attended a picnic on the White House lawn where they were addressed by Franklin from the South Portico. The President admonished them to condemn not merely the Nazi regime but all dictatorships. The President was reportedly booed by the group. Afterwards, many of the same youth picketed the White House as representatives of the American Peace Mobilization. Among them was Joseph Cadden, one of Roosevelt's overnight boarders. Later in 1940, despite Roosevelt's publication of her reasons [...] "Why I still believe in the Youth Congress," [...] the American Youth Congress was disbanded. The NYA was shut down in 1943.|$|E
2500|$|During the South Carolina Democratic Debate in Myrtle Beach, Edwards {{sought to}} {{distinguish}} himself from Senators Obama and Clinton, and criticized {{them for their}} attacks and [...] "big city" [...] politics.

2500|$|Further, Wilby {{submitted}} {{that the}} Council committed {{a criminal act}} when they allowed the movement of toxic waste without a licence: in 1986 there was no proper permission in place for moving the contaminated waste, only for moving 'inert' waste.

Wilby said that the council had deliberately ignored the advice from experts to properly analyse the site because it was going to be an expensive task. He said: [...] "They decided they were going to do this 'dig-and-dump'. They thought 'we have got this great deal of land and all this spoil on this site which must be contaminated, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> get it off there because we'll never be able to sell it.'"

2500|$|Later, on 27 July, Austria-Hungary {{started to}} {{complete}} the preparations for war. That same day, Jagow informed Szögyény {{that he was only}} pretending to take up the British offers of mediation in order to ensure British neutrality but had no intention of stopping the war. Szögyény reported [...] "in order to avoid a misunderstanding" [...] that Jagow had promised him that [...] "the German government assured Austria in the most binding fashion that it in no way identifies itself with the proposal , which may very shortly be brought to Your Excellency 's notice by the German government: it is, on the contrary decidedly opposed to consideration of them and is only passing them on out of deference to the British request" [...] (emphasis in the original). Jagow went on to state he was [...] "absolutely against taking account of the British wish, because [...] "the German government point of view was that it was at the moment of the highest importance to prevent Britain from making common cause with Russia and France. We must therefore avoid any action [...] might cut the line, which has so far worked so well, between Germany and Britain". Szögyény ended his telegram that [...] "If Germany candidly told Grey that it refused to communicate England’s peace plan, that objective [...] might not be achieved." [...] Bethmann Hollweg, in a message to Prince Tschirschky, wrote on 27 July: [...] "As we have already rejected one British proposal for a conference, it is not possible for us to refuse this suggestion also a limine. If we rejected every attempt at mediation, the whole world would hold us responsible for the conflagration and represent us as the real war-mongers. That would also make our position impossible here in Germany, where <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> appear as though the war had been forced on us. Our position is the more difficult because Serbia seems to have given way very extensively. We cannot therefore reject the role of mediator; we have to pass on the British proposal to Vienna for consideration, especially since London and Paris are continuously using their influence on St. Petersburg." [...] In passing on Grey's message, Bethmann Hollweg deleted the last line, which read: [...] "Also, the whole world here is convinced, and I hear from my colleagues that the key to the situation lies in Berlin, and that if Berlin seriously wants peace, it will prevent Vienna from following a foolhardy policy." [...] In his reply to London, Bethmann Hollweg pretended that: [...] "We have immediately initiated mediation in Vienna in the sense desired by Sir Edward Grey." [...] Jagow sent Grey’s offer to Tschirschky, his ambassador in Vienna, but ordered him to not show it to any Austrian official in case they might accept it. At the same time, Bethmann Hollweg sent a distorted account of Grey’s offer to Wilhelm.|$|E
