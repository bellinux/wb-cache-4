We had all pews full as many Glendale Church of Christ members came {{to support}} both John Dale and our Revival. His topic was [...] "Jubilee--What We Can Do Here in Murray/Calloway County?" [...] Rev. Dole [...] commented, [...] "I {{appreciate}} this opportunity. Ray had told me, 'Just come, {{do whatever you}} want to do, say whatever you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> trust you. You are not on trial.' I appreciate that. You are very warm and welcoming." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jackson's solid-bronze casket (which {{reportedly}} cost USD $25,000) {{was placed}} in front of the stage. Numerous celebrity guests attended the services. His brothers each wore a single, white, sparkling glove, while Stevie Wonder, Mariah Carey, Lionel Richie, Jermaine Jackson and others sang his songs. Jackson's then 11-year-old daughter, Paris, broke down as she told the crowd, [...] "I just want to say, ever since I was born, Daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine ... and I just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> love him... so much." [...] Marlon Jackson said, [...] "Maybe now, Michael, they will leave you alone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sadiq Daba in an {{interview}} stated: “It [...] cuts across the whole of Nigeria and back to our colonial days. It talks about our ethnic intra-relationships and many more”. The film explores issues on Paedophilia, depicting a young boy, Koya being molested by a western religious leader, Father Dowling, a supposed custodian of societal moral standards; This makes disappointed and angry Koya to hold the belief that [...] "western education is evil", a slogan associated with the present day Boko Haram. Tunde Babalola, the scriptwriter commented: [...] "As a writer, I want to delve into subjects that people don’t want to talk about. I don’t want to write things that people <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> would rather write {{about things that are}} controversial, and that which will get people talking for weeks". Victor Akande of The Nation comments: [...] "October 1 captures the approach used by two young men who are vexed by a system (Western education) they expect will make them better humans, but which ends up corrupting their traditional upbringing; worse still, by men of same sex".|$|E

"You shall hear it directly--if {{you will}} first {{allow me to}} finish what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> wish--if I can--to persuade you that I come here as a friend, before I mention my name.

50|$|Arrest {{of speech}} {{is a form}} of anarthria. The child is unable to utter a single intelligible word and {{attempts}} to communicate with gestures. My mouth opened and I could not speak. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> cannot speak. At the same time, it was as if somebody was strangling me.|$|R
2500|$|In 2013, Eminem also {{addressed}} the mindstate he had {{while working on}} 2009's Relapse saying: [...] "It was interesting, man. I don't know if before Relapse, if we're talking the Infinite album and pre-signing with Dre and all that, from that point on, I don't know if I ever did anything or did much sober at all. Relapse was the first album and first recordings that I did when the lights went on and I was sober. I {{was still trying to}} figure things out...It's interesting. Fun time. I had a fun time." [...] and reiterated his feeling about the album [...] "I felt Relapse was, I don't know. I don't know if people know what I really had to go through {{to be able to make}} Relapse and to be able to write again and to be able to think again and just normal everyday bodily functions and functions in my mind. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> wasn't in a place to record again, but I needed time. I needed time to be able to figure out things. I wanted to be able to make my songs feel like something again. I know a lot of stuff on Relapse was comical and funny punchline jokes, but a lot of the songs didn't really feel like anything. I had to go back and listen to some of my older music to try to figure out what I was doing wrong. Once I felt like I figured that out, I started making songs that felt like something again." ...|$|E

5000|$|Rustin said: [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> write {{something}} for somebody where I {{know he is}} acting like a puppet. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be a real ghost and write what the person <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> And that is what I always knew was true {{in the case of}} Martin. I would never write anything that wasn't what he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> understood him well enough." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2016, an ad {{campaign}} for Elie Tahari called [...] "Madam President" [...] featured Shlomit Malka {{as a female}} president of the United States.

50|$|This was {{the first}} song that I wrote for the album, this was like two years ago, which is crazy <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that. <b>I</b> just knew it was {{something}} that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> just felt compelled, and I didn’t even really still know about the whole concept of the album yet, like I had this idea in my mind, but this is just something <b>I</b> really needed <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not angry; {{the things}} I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> can't seem to say. It isn't your fault or mine. It's just fate. I {{hate to think}} of 'marrying well'--" ...|$|E
6000|$|She stopped Foster, {{who began}} to murmur something. [...] "This is not all I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> am {{not the only person}} who loves Lawrence and owes you much. Don't be too modest; urge your claim." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm {{very sorry}} I said such horrid {{things to you}} just now. I {{have been talking to}} Mr Mifflin, and I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> think it was ever so nice and {{thoughtful}} of you. I understand everything.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right, Jack, I {{knew that}} I could rely upon you; and now {{come in to}} tea, {{and there was one}} thing <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> you once a month to come over to me at Birmingham on Saturday {{afternoon}} and stay till Sunday evening. It will be a great pleasure to me; I shall see how you are getting on, and shall hear all the news of Stokebridge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{you have}} helped me on <b>to</b> what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> wasn't surprised--how could I be? The kind of people I'd met out here had seldom much money, or much of anything; but I had {{generally}} less, and they held out a hand when I needed it and gave me what they had. It stirs {{me in a way}} that almost hurts to think of it." ...|$|R
60|$|VIVIE. It's Praed. He's going <b>to</b> Italy and <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye. <b>I</b> {{asked him}} to call this afternoon. Go and let him in.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I do. It's {{just that}} I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> {{want to be}} a human being; I want to learn about things and know about things, and not to be {{protected}} as something too precious for life, cooped up in one narrow little corner." ...|$|E
6000|$|FRUST. I'd {{like to meet}} Miss Hellgrove. [She {{comes forward}} eagerly and timidly. He grasps her hand] Miss Hellgrove, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> thought that fine--fine. [Her evident emotion and {{pleasure}} warm him so that he increases his grasp and commendation] Fine. It quite got my soft spots. Emotional. Fine! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It seems egotistical {{to begin}} by saying so much about myself,' he resumed, 'but {{whatever}} I say to you seems, even in my own ears, below what I want to say, and different from what I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> can't help it. So it is. You are the ruin of me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And if they were, I couldn't {{afford to}} buy, with this Irish Encumbered Estates' Bill.

5000|$|On the Verve Records website, Krall {{explains}} the songwriting for the album in more detail: [...] "I wrote {{the music and}} then Elvis and I talked about what we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> told him stories and wrote pages and pages of reminiscences, descriptions and images, and he put them into tighter lyrical form. For 'Departure Bay,' I wrote down {{a list of things}} that I love about home, things I realized were different, even exotic, now that I've been away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> how <b>I</b> got it, Colonel, {{unless it}} is necessary"--he was {{blushing}} a trifle--"but I'll stake my life upon its truth in the main." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But wait," [...] she {{resisted}} him, prisoning his eager hand in hers. [...] "There is more I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> remember Dick {{and all our}} past years. But I remember him to-day, as well, and to-morrow. I cannot bear the thought that any man should pity my husband, that you should pity him, and pity him you must when I confess that I love you more. That is why I am not sure. That is why I so quickly take it back and do not know.|$|E
6000|$|... "Carrie," [...] he said, [...] "you {{will tell}} me more if you wish; if not, it doesn't matter. There is another thing I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> have often been sorry for you, but I felt {{that you would not}} find it quite so hard some day. That is why I waited--I think very patiently--though it was a little hard on me, too. I thought I knew what you must feel--indeed, you showed it to me--and I was horribly afraid that, if I was too hasty, I might lose you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't want to {{hurt your}} father. I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> might, if I chose. I {{want to speak to}} him. Not much in that, is there? There shall be no secrets from you; you shall be by. And plainly, Miss Riderhood, there's nothing to be got out of me, or made of me. I am not good for the Leaving Shop, I am not good for the Boarding-House, I am not good for {{anything}} in your way to the extent of sixpenn'orth of halfpence. Put the idea aside, and we shall get on together.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen, Fanny," [...] I said, pronouncing {{the words}} as best I could with a tongue {{that seemed to be}} {{sticking}} to the roof of my mouth; [...] "I am tired of the garden. What do you really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> me? <b>I</b> don't much care for your--your fun." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, {{perhaps we}} shall {{be able to talk}} for five minutes," [...] she says. [...] "I've so often <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that <b>I</b> shall never forgive you. You have been simply horrid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I only <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that <b>I</b> should hate any one {{who bought}} Pardons ten times worse than I used {{to hate the}} second Mrs. Chapin. Think what we've put into it of our two selves." ...|$|R
6000|$|I do {{not know}} how to begin to say what I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> am afraid [...] of losing you out of my life by not writing, and I'm afraid if I [...] write, I will lose you. It is {{impossible}} for me to say what you've [...] done for me. I never would have been anything more than a poor [...] farmer, only for you. I don't want to apologize to you for telling [...] you how much you are to me. I want to appeal to you to give me a [...] chance to work for you; that's all. I want you to give me some [...] hope, if you can.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dear Friend,--I {{am about}} to tire your {{patience}} heavily. For I must find you some reasons for doing so little in making known these Melanesian dialects, {{and that will be}} wearisome for you to read; and, secondly, I cannot put down clearly and consecutively what I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> have so very little time for thinking out, and working at any one subject continuously, that my whole habit of mind becomes, I fear, inaccurate and desultory. I have so very many and so very different occupations, and so much anxiety and so many interruptions, as the [...] "friction" [...] that attends the working, of a new and somewhat untried machine.' ...|$|E
6000|$|He obeyed {{her like}} a child and listened through his mist of tears as she rambled on. [...] "I've had my share of trouble," [...] she explained. [...] "First my mother went, then my oldest boy, then my husband took sick. Yes, a body has to face trouble about so often, anyway, and, besides, I don't suppose your mother was afraid of death, anyhow. I've known all along what her {{business}} was, ever since I came into the house, and I've been up to see her a few times. Still I'm {{not much of a}} believer. Dad is, though. It's his greatest affliction that he can't hear The Voices any more. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> believe in your mother. She was a mighty fine woman; but the docterin of spiritualism I never could swaller, notwithstanding I grew up 'longside of it." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{my return}} from the {{afternoon}} service I found that they had just got back. One look at them {{told me that the}} lawyer had said what he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> had never before seen Rachel so silent and so thoughtful. I had never before seen Mr. Bruff pay her such devoted attention, and look at her with such marked respect. He had (or pretended that he had) an engagement to dinner that day--and he took an early leave of us all; intending to go back to London by the first train the next morning.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure I love him?" [...] she said. [...] "Oh, {{what words}} can say Yes for me, as <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it? <b>I</b> love him--!" [...] Her voice faltered softly; and her answer {{ended in a}} sigh.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, when <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything, <b>I</b> can mostly find words <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it in, thank God. Not as I'm a-finding faut wi' my husband, for if he's a man o' few words, {{what he says}} he'll stand to." ...|$|R
