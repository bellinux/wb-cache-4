5|$|In 499 CE, the Indian {{astronomer}} Aryabhata propounded {{a planetary}} model that explicitly incorporated Earth's rotation about its axis, which he explains {{as the cause}} of <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be an apparent westward motion of the stars. He also believed that the orbits of planets are elliptical.|$|E
5|$|In places, the {{seemingly}} at odds architectural styles {{can be viewed}} simultaneously; this is particularly so in the chimney stacks which resemble Islamic minarets. These coupled with the castellated parapets add <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be an almost Moorish element to the late English Renaissance air of the northern facade.|$|E
50|$|Thunderblast is not {{the first}} Transformer to possess an {{especially}} feminine figure, with features such as a shaped torso, hips and even <b>what</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be breasts underneath her chest-plate, (Blackarachnia was perhaps most notable for this) but she is the first <b>to</b> have <b>what</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> be nipples, seen only for perhaps one instant in the show itself.|$|R

5|$|A {{triangular}} banner {{appearing to}} depict a bird (possibly a raven) appears on a penny minted by Olaf Cuaran around 940. The coin features a roughly right isosceles triangular standard, {{with the two}} equilateral sides situated {{at the top and}} staff, respectively. Along the hypotenuse are a series of five tabs or tassels. The staff is topped by <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be a cross; this may indicate a fusion of pagan and Christian symbolism.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2000, Corzine denied {{having made}} {{payments}} to African-American ministers, although the foundation controlled by Jon and Joanne Corzine had paid one influential black church $25,000. Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, {{director of the}} Black Ministers Council, had campaigned against a form of racial profiling whereby police officers stop minority drivers and had gotten New Jersey state police superintendent, Carl A. Williams, fired. Corzine had donated to Jackson prior to getting <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be a reciprocal endorsement.|$|E
5|$|Ann (Rashida Jones), who is {{preparing}} for her first date with Mark (Paul Schneider), worriedly asks Leslie (Amy Poehler) if she has any reservations, since Leslie previously had feelings for him.

5|$|Apart {{from the}} main road, there are five avenues, each planted in its own species and named accordingly: oak, poplar, birch, lime, and sycamore. The tree-lined avenues give Barrhill a charming appearance. Wason had trees planted in an unusual pattern around the market square. Residents only noticed in 1975 when viewing an aerial photo that those trees form <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be the three circles of Trinity, with the two inner avenues {{possibly}} symbolising a crucifix.|$|E
5|$|As a Predator ship reaches Earth's orbit, it fires a beam {{that creates}} a passage through the ice towards {{the source of the}} heat bloom. When the team arrives at the {{abandoned}} whaling station above the heat source, they find the passage and descend beneath the ice. They locate the mysterious pyramid and begin to explore it, finding evidence of a prehistoric civilization and <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be a sacrificial chamber filled with human skeletons with ruptured rib cages.|$|E
5|$|Burns talks Homer into {{cheating}} {{and they}} use a snowmobile to reach the cabin. Arriving early, they settle down in the comfortable surroundings and quickly become friends. While clinking their champagne glasses, they inadvertently cause an avalanche that buries the entire cabin. The two make several attempts at escaping but are unsuccessful. The other employees reach <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be their destination; however, it is actually a ranger station and they begin to realize that something bad has happened to their colleagues.|$|E

5|$|Chinese astronomical records {{report that}} in 365 BC, Gan De {{detected}} <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> {{have been a}} moon of Jupiter, probably Ganymede, with the naked eye. However, Gan De reported {{the color of the}} companion as reddish, which is puzzling since the moons are too faint for their color to be perceived with the naked eye. Shi Shen and Gan De together made fairly accurate observations of the five major planets.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006 a major {{community}} archaeological dig was organised in the grounds by the Museum of London Archaeological Archive and Research Centre, {{as part of}} the centenary celebrations of the opening of Bruce Castle Museum, in which large numbers of local youths took part. As well as large quantities of discarded everyday objects, the chalk foundations of <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be an earlier house on the site were discovered.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor and {{his companions}} Amy Pond and her husband Rory find themselves trapped in <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be a 1980s hotel with constantly changing corridors. They meet Rita, Howie, Joe, and Gibbis, who have also appeared in the hotel, without any idea how they arrived.

5|$|The {{ambiguity}} {{inherent in}} the IAU's definition was highlighted in December 2005, when the Spitzer Space Telescope observed Cha 110913-773444 (above), only eight times Jupiter's mass with <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be the beginnings of its own planetary system. Were this object found in orbit around another star, {{it would have been}} termed a planet.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} a metal box brought in {{containing}} the remains of Billy Miles. The coroner examines it and notices <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be a metal vertebra. After he leaves the room, the metal vertebra begins to spin, growing into what looks like {{the beginnings of a}} metallic spine. Meanwhile, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Monica Reyes arrive at the abandoned town where Special Agent John Doggett (Robert Patrick) was born.|$|E
5|$|The {{most famous}} {{project of the}} Mycenaean era was the network of roads in the Peloponnese. This appears to have {{facilitated}} the speedy deployment of troops—for example, {{the remnants of a}} Mycenaean road, along with <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have been a Mycenaean defensive wall on the Isthmus of Corinth. The Mycenaean era saw the zenith of infrastructure engineering in Greece, and this appears not to have been limited to the Argive plain.|$|E

5|$|When Rotting {{first came}} out it stirred {{a huge amount of}} {{controversy}} due to its cover art— a traditional grim reaper figure licking <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be Jesus Christ's face. It was based upon a medieval painting. The cover artist himself, Kelson Frost, refused to paint a crown of thorns over the man's head, which would readily identify him as the Christian messiah.|$|E
5|$|During {{the mating}} season, the male moults its brown {{feathers}} and displays a fiery red plumage. It may fluff its red back and shoulder feathers out so they cover {{part of the}} wings in a puffball-display. It will fly about and confront another male to repel it, or to assert dominance over a female. It also picks red petals and sometimes red seeds and presents them to other birds. 90% of the time, the male presents to a female in <b>what</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be a courtship ritual. The other 10% of the time, it presents to another male {{in an act of}} apparent aggression.|$|E

He throws everything he has found back into the hole he has dug before starting to fill it in. He walks back up to the house and, finding Lee waiting for him, kisses her.
