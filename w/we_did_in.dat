500|$|When Project 86 {{released}} their self-titled record, {{they were}} generally acknowledged to be a rapcore band. Schwab has maintained {{it was never}} intentional, [...] "I think we got lumped in with that music because we [...] toured with P.O.D. and Linkin Park." [...] According to writer Mark Allan Powell, the music featured [...] "cryptic, down-tuned guitars" [...] and [...] "half-spoken, half-rapped" [...] vocals. Drawing Black Lines saw their style adopt elements of traditional metal, groove metal, and hard rock. The band used their song [...] "Pipedream" [...] as a blueprint to build the album: [...] "We knew {{that was one of}} the brightest spots on the album," [...] said Schwab, [...] "I just wanted to take what <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> 'Pipedream' and go further with it".

500|$|United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559 {{called for}} the {{disarmament}} of militia with the Taif agreement {{at the end of}} the Lebanese civil war. Hezbollah denounced, and protested against, the resolution. The 2006 military conflict with Israel has increased the controversy. Failure to disarm remains a violation of the resolution and agreement as well as subsequent United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701. Since then both Israel and Hezbollah have asserted that the organization has gained in military strength. A Lebanese public opinion poll taken in August 2006 shows that most of the Shia did not believe that Hezbollah should disarm after the 2006 Lebanon war, while the majority of Sunni, Druze and Christians believed that they should. The Lebanese cabinet, under president Michel Suleiman and Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, guidelines state that Hezbollah enjoys the right to [...] "liberate occupied lands."

Thomas's wife Rebecca was initially reluctant to have a character based on her, but agreed {{if they could get}} Hannigan to play her. Radnor and Segel were relative unknowns, but Smulders, another relatively little-known actress, was cast as Robin after [...] Jennifer Love Hewitt turned down the role in favor of Ghost Whisperer. Bays and Thomas commented on her casting by saying, [...] "thank God we did for a million reasons... when Ted’s seeing {{her for the first time}}, America’s seeing her for the first time — the intriguingness of that propelled the show going forward and kept the show alive".|$|E

[...] Despite losing their fourth consecutive Charity Shield match, Ferguson did not believe it would affect his team heading into the start of the season: [...] "We certainly hope we can go on to win the title again like we have in previous years. We just need to keep the standards up and show the desire <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> the second half." [...] He was also unsure whether Liverpool would be able to challenge for the Premier League: [...] "It's difficult to assess Liverpool at the moment. They started with confidence, but then you would expect that from a team that won three trophies a few months ago. You would also expect us to be sluggish at the start, because we are bloody good at it." ...|$|E

We will make long excursions in the mountains, we will find new paths, just as <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> Stein!" [...] But her health worsened, {{and by the end of}} November, all hope was gone. By the beginning of 1853, the princess was bedridden, and she knew death was approaching: [...] "My strength diminishes from day to day; I can feel it... we are reaching the beginning of the end." [...] A little after midnight in the early hours of 4 February, a priest administered the last rites.

500|$|According to Field, the {{transition}} from writing music for an adult rock band to writing children's music was not a big one for The Wiggles. [...] "The Wiggles music isn't all that far removed from what <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> The Cockroaches, just a different subject matter", Field stated. [...] "The Cockroaches sing about girls and love and stuff like that; The Wiggles sing about hot potatoes and cold spaghetti." [...] Moran stated that The Wiggles wrote songs they liked and would listen to, and then made them appropriate for children. [...] They approached simple and relocatable topics, such as food and nutrition, as teachers would in a pre-school setting, with simple melodies that were easy for children to sing and remember. [...] The group sang the same 60s-style pop as The Cockroaches, but with different lyrics, although they were not confined to songs about love and could write about anything that interested and excited young children, which was limitless. [...] The music they chose to write and perform was influenced by nursery rhymes, folk music, and rock songs of the 1950s and 1960s. [...] Page reported, [...] "First and foremost, we're entertainers". [...] The Wiggles captured the interest of children by first entertaining them, and then by presenting them with educational messages.|$|E

The club beat Odense BK and Standard Liège {{to reach the}} quarter-finals, with the latter {{described}} as a [...] "breathtaking performance" [...] by Graham, after winning 7–0 at the Stade Maurice Dufrasne. Arsenal defeated Torino of Italy and French representative Paris Saint-Germain to reach the 1994 European Cup Winners' Cup Final alongside Parma, staged at Copenhagen. Without top goalscorer Ian Wright and markers John Jensen and Martin Keown, Arsenal went into the final as outsiders. Although Parma began the match the strongest of both teams, Arsenal opened the scoring through a well taken volley by striker Alan Smith. Defending in numbers, the team held on to record an improbable victory and win the club's second European trophy, after a 24-year wait. After the match Graham praised his team's performance and defended his pragmatic approach; [...] "Sometimes we could go forward {{a little bit more}} and entertain a bit more, but we play to our strengths, like <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> this match. There's nothing wrong with having a very, very good defence, believe me. We've proved it, and it's a big plus." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 1991, Anthony Field founded The Wiggles, a children's music group, {{with fellow}} {{university}} students Murray Cook and Greg Page, Phillip Wilcher (from Macquarie University's music department) and The Cockroaches' band mate, Jeff Fatt. In July, they issued their debut album, The Wiggles, which {{was dedicated to}} Paul Field's daughter and sold 70,000 copies. The Wiggles {{went on to become}} [...] "a global powerhouse in children's entertainment". They used former The Cockroaches' members for musical and performing support: Paul, John, and Henry (The Wiggles' character Henry the Octopus was named after him) performed with them on their CDs, DVDs, and stage shows. John helped them write many of their songs. Many early The Wiggles' songs were The Cockroaches' tunes reworked to fit the genre of children's music. According to Anthony, [...] "The Wiggles music isn't all that far removed from what <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> The Cockroaches, just a different subject matter... The Cockroaches sing about girls and love and stuff like that; The Wiggles sing about hot potatoes and cold spaghetti". Paul worked for James Roland Wood, Chief Judge at Common Law, for three years after the band stopped regularly performing and during The Wiggles' formation, which he said gave Anthony time to develop his new band alone, without much input from his brothers. In the mid-1990s, Paul became The Wiggles' talent manager.|$|E

On 6 November, Benfica played Celtic on the road. In their second game against the team, Benfica lost 1–0 on a goal by Aiden McGeady. With the loss, Benfica was in last place and needed to defeat Milan to remain in the Champions League. Although Camacho was optimistic, he was aware of the high stakes. On 11 November, Benfica hosted Boavista in search of their fourth {{consecutive}} win in the Primeira Liga. Cardozo scored in the first half, with Boavista tying the score in the 58th minute. Benfica then scored five goals in the final 40 minutes for a 6–1 win. After the match, Rui Costa said, [...] "We had our fourth consecutive win in the Primeira Liga, and I think we are on the right track." [...] After a third international break, Benfica resumed on the 24th with an away game against Académica. Lito scored first for Académica, but a free kick by Rui Costa tied the game. Académica goalkeeper Ricardo made two errors, allowing Luisão and Adu to score Benfica's second and third goals, and Camacho credited the late win to his players' perseverance and commitment. November ended with a decisive match against Milan. Andrea Pirlo scored for Benfica, but Maxi Pereira's 23th-minute shot tied the game. Benfica's fate was determined by events in Glasgow, as Celtic defeated Shakhtar Donetsk with an added-time goal. Camacho bemoaned his team's luck: [...] "We're a bit unhappy.
