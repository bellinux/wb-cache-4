The clock, striking the quarter and full hours, was restored to working order in December 2001, <b>with</b> <b>automatic</b> <b>winding</b> installed.

The Clock House was opened on 23 July 1956 and used The Shambles' clock, illuminated dials and bell.

5000|$|In horology, a {{complication}} {{refers to}} any feature in a mechanical timepiece beyond the simple display of hours and minutes. A timepiece indicating only hours and minutes is {{otherwise known as}} a simple movement. Common complications in commercial watches are day/date displays, alarms, chronographs (stopwatches), and <b>automatic</b> <b>winding</b> mechanisms.|$|R
50|$|By the 1960s, <b>automatic</b> <b>winding</b> {{had become}} {{standard}} in quality mechanical watches. Because the rotor weight needed in an automatic watch takes {{up a lot}} of space in the case, increasing its thickness, some manufacturers of quality watches, such as Patek Philippe, continue to design manually wound watches, which can be as thin as 1.77 millimeters.|$|R
50|$|Around the 1960s this 'jewel craze' reached new heights, and {{manufacturers}} made watches with 41, 53, 75, or even 100 jewels. Most of these additional jewels were totally nonfunctional; they never contacted moving parts, and were included just {{to increase the}} jewel count. For example, the Waltham 100 jewel watch consisted of an ordinary 17 jewel movement, with 83 tiny pieces of ruby mounted around the <b>automatic</b> <b>winding</b> rotor.|$|R

40|$|Abstrakt. The {{subject of}} this Bachelor’s Thesis is {{automation}} of the gaskets production process in the workshop of Leader Gasket of Slovakia, s. r. o. The objective is to design inner rings feeder for semi-automatic winding machine. This will upgrade the semi-automatic winding machine, required operator to load inner ring, to <b>automatic</b> <b>winding</b> machine. The final product should make the process fully <b>automatic</b> and simpler <b>with</b> minimum requirements for operator actions. The Bachelor’s Thesis provides the analysis of input parameters required by existing production process. The next part is {{the design of the}} movement mechanism by accepting the optimal selection of the movers and 3 D modeling by using Solid Works software. The last part describes the control logic of the feeding mechanism, selection of proper pneumatic and electronic control components and their integration with the existing equipment, <b>automatic</b> <b>winding</b> machine, which the feeding mechanism will be part of. The output of the Bachelor’s Thesis is the design of real feeding mechanism, which fulfills all required performance criterions and is ready to be build...|$|R
50|$|Breguet invented {{innovative}} escapements, {{including the}} tourbillon, <b>automatic</b> <b>winding</b> mechanisms, and the overcoil (an {{improvement of the}} balance spring with a raised outer coil). Within ten years Breguet had commissions from the aristocratic families of France and even the French queen, Marie-Antoinette. Cécile died in 1780. He met Abraham-Louis Perrelet in Switzerland and became a Master Clockmaker in 1784. In 1787 Abraham-Louis established a partnership with Xavier Gide, which lasted until 1791.|$|R

50|$|Over the years, the Petrodvorets Watch Factory has {{produced}} {{more than two dozen}} versions of Raketa movements. Some have been equipped with features such as <b>automatic</b> <b>winding,</b> calendars, 24-hour models for polar explorers, anti-magnetic watches (for use in case of nuclear attack), as well as watches for the military. Mechanical Raketa watches were exported to many Eastern Bloc and communist countries and are {{considered one of the most}} durable and reliable movements in the world. By the 1980s Raketa was producing five million watches a year.|$|R
50|$|The company fits {{certified}} chronometers in all models. Watches {{are usually}} marketed towards either diving (SuperOcean) or aviation (Navitimer). Aviation models {{such as the}} Navitimer offer aviation functions largely as complications, since their function in aviation has largely been replaced by modern electronic instruments. The styling of Breitling watches is characterized by polished cases, bracelets and large watch faces which are designed to improve readability. Many models have an <b>automatic</b> <b>winding</b> mechanism that is purely mechanical (i.e. using no electronic components) and frequently have complications.|$|R

The Seamaster is particularly popular among celebrities, with famous wearers including Prince William, Joe Biden, Jeremy Clarkson, Gabriel Holmes and Adam Savage. An Omega Seamaster typically has a stainless steel case and bracelet (Bond style with Omega symbol clasp), screw-in crown and case-back, engraved with the Omega hippocampus logo, up to 1200-metre water resistant, luminescent hands, unidirectional bezel, blue, silver or black dial with orange accents, sapphire crystal (anti-reflective) and helium release valve.|$|R
