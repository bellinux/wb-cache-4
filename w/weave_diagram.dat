40|$|ABSTRACT: Industrial {{woven fabrics}} {{employed}} as substrates in man-made leather products {{are based on}} a variety of simple weave patterns. Structural variations are controlled through selection of yarn size, thread count, and the pattern of interlacing as illustrated by the <b>weave</b> <b>diagram.</b> Woven fabrics usually provide adequate strength and flexibility to man-made leather (MML) constructions, but generally lack the bulk and smooth surface needed to achieve the hand and appearance of leather. The use of thick, expanded layers of coating and the napping process have been used successfully to overcome these deficiencies. KEY WORDS: Man-made leather, woven fabrics, pattern variations, napping...|$|E

In the {{ordinary}} loom, the 3 D woven fabrics like the orthogonal/connected stitching structure, angle Alliance/interlocked stitching structure by the reasonable transformation, <b>weaving</b> <b>diagram</b> and looming draft, have been woven in this paper. Using ordinary loom weaving fabrics, {{it would not}} only save the cost of production, but also has good controllability of woven fabrics. Good structural design and integrity of the 3 D woven fabrics, own tight fabric structure, superior mechanical properties, low price, and broad application prospects. The results shows that this design would give a basis for further study on the development perform of 3 D textile structural composite materials...|$|R
40|$|The new {{constructs}} in aspect-oriented programming {{bring new}} types of programming faults with respect to crosscutting concerns, such as incorrect pointcuts and advice. This paper presents a UML-based approach to testing whether or not an aspect-oriented program conforms to its expected crosscutting behavior. We explore aspect-oriented UML design models to derive tests for exercising interactions between aspects and classes. Each aspect-oriented model consists of class diagrams, aspect diagrams, and sequence diagrams. For a method under test, we <b>weave</b> the sequence <b>diagrams</b> of the advice on the method into the method’s sequence diagram. Based on the <b>woven</b> sequence <b>diagram</b> and class/aspect diagrams, we then generate an AOF (Aspect-Object Flow) tree by applying coverage criteria such as condition coverage, polymorphic coverage, and loop coverage to <b>woven</b> sequence <b>diagrams.</b> In the AOF tree, each path from the root to a leaf is an abstract message sequence, indicating a template of test cases. A concrete test case is obtained by creating objects that satisfy the collective constraints in the template. Our empirical study shows that the model-based testing approach is capable of revealing several types of aspect-specific faults, including incorrect advice type, incorrect (weaker or stronger) pointcut strengths, and incorrect aspect precedence...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} generating tests for adequately exercising interaction between aspects and classes based on aspect-oriented UML models. In this approach, an aspect-oriented model consists of class diagrams, aspect diagrams, and sequence diagrams. Since methods of classes and advices of aspects are both specified by sequence diagrams, the advices on a given method can be weaved into a new sequence diagram, which {{is essential to the}} weaving mechanism in AOSD. For a <b>woven</b> sequence <b>diagram,</b> the approach exploits goal-directed reasoning to construct a flow graph for a given coverage criteria (e. g. the combination of branch coverage and polymorphic coverage in this paper), and further expands the graph to a flow tree, where each path is a test. Then the approach derives objects with desired states for exercising each test in the flow tree...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Due to {{advances}} in woollen woven textile manufacture, {{the occurrence of}} industrial textile mending has diminished. While the demand for the skill is still present in certain settings, the availability of learning resources is limited relating to this particular craft. The purpose of this project is to design and produce an effective educational learning tool to teach mending skills. Design/methodology/approach: To address the aims of this dissertation project, bricolage methodology and qualitative research methods have been employed. Using the findings from primary and secondary research, the educational, instructional video was developed in order to document and display the mending craft practice in a format that would endure and be accessible to anybody who wished to learn. After determining {{that the ability to}} understand woven pattern structures was key in learning mending skill, the visual tool was developed using two dimensional <b>woven</b> structure <b>diagrams</b> and animations to train pattern comprehension and recognition. Findings: The results of educational video tool testing confirmed that using two dimensional animated <b>diagrams</b> of <b>woven</b> structures was an effective method to teach pattern comprehension. Also, {{it was found that the}} trainee’s participation in the instructional video was effective in helping to teach other learners mending skills. The structure of the educational video made the learning more organized and comprehensible as it assisted in learning process through the combined media that reiterated the same information in different formats. Originality/value: Design technology was applied to provide a comprehensible educational resource that could be used to learn and revitalise mending skills. The principles and methods applied in this resource could be adapted to teach different textile disciplines or other craft practices...|$|R
