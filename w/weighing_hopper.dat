50|$|A ‘typical target’ weight per pack {{might be}} 100 grams of a product. The product is fed {{to the top}} of the {{multihead}} weigher where it is dispersed to the pool hoppers. Each pool hopper drops the product into a <b>weigh</b> <b>hopper</b> beneath it as soon as the <b>weigh</b> <b>hopper</b> becomes empty.|$|R
50|$|An extra {{layer of}} hoppers (‘booster hoppers’) {{can be added}} to store product which has been weighed in the <b>weigh</b> <b>hoppers</b> but not used in a weighment, thus {{increasing}} the number of suitable combinations available to the computer and so increasing speed and accuracy.|$|R
50|$|In industry, a {{rotary valve}} {{is used to}} {{regulate}} the flow of a product, usually to reduce the flow rate to a level more suitable to the process being undertaken. Typical applications are for feeding a <b>weighed</b> <b>hopper</b> or for feeding a mill that can be clogged by the product.|$|R
50|$|The weigher’s {{computer}} {{determines the}} weight of product in each individual <b>weigh</b> <b>hopper</b> and identifies which combination contains the weight closest to the target weight of 100g. The multihead weigher opens all the hoppers of this combination and the product falls, via a discharge chute, into a bagmaker or, alternatively, into a distribution system which places the product, for example, into trays.|$|R

5000|$|The 4.5 mi {{single track}} branch opened in 1960 in {{preparation}} for the opening of the colliery in 1963. It left the LD&ECR about a kilometre west of Boughton and turned north. Half the line was in cutting, half on a bank, with a 350 yd tunnel (built to preserve agricultural land), bridges over the River Maun and River Meden and 2 roads and seven bridges over the railway. Bevercotes was described as the first fully automated colliery and also the first to be fully equipped to load coal into Merry-go-round trains [...] Trains were fed by four 35 ton <b>weigh</b> <b>hoppers</b> fed from a 4,000 ton storage bunker built by Head Wrightson. The colliery closed in 1993. The line closed after removal of coal stockpiles.|$|R
40|$|Dynamic <b>weighing</b> of the <b>hopper</b> in grape {{harvesters}} {{is affected by}} a number of factors. One of them is the displacement of the load inside the hopper {{as a consequence of the}} terrain topography. In this work, the weight obtained by a load cell in a grape harvester has been analysed and quantified using the discrete element method (DEM). Different models have been developed considering different scenarios for the terrain...|$|R
5|$|Modern {{furnaces}} {{are equipped}} {{with an array of}} supporting facilities to increase efficiency, such as ore storage yards where barges are unloaded. The raw materials are transferred to the stockhouse complex by ore bridges, or rail hoppers and ore transfer cars. Rail-mounted scale cars or computer controlled weight <b>hoppers</b> <b>weigh</b> out the various raw materials to yield the desired hot metal and slag chemistry. The raw materials are brought {{to the top of the}} blast furnace via a skip car powered by winches or conveyor belts.|$|R
50|$|The cell uses {{conventional}} piston and cylinder arrangement. The piston {{is placed}} in a thin elastic diaphragm. The piston doesn't actually {{come in contact with}} the load cell. Mechanical stops are placed to prevent over strain of the diaphragm when the loads exceed certain limit. The load cell is completely filled with oil. When the load is applied on the piston, the movement of the piston and the diaphragm results in an increase of oil pressure. This pressure is then transmitted to a hydraulic pressure gauge via a high pressure hose. The gauge's Bourdon tube senses the pressure and registers it on the dial. Because this sensor has no electrical components, it is ideal for use in hazardous areas. Typical hydraulic load cell applications include tank, bin, and <b>hopper</b> <b>weighing.</b> By example, a hydraulic load cell is immune to transient voltages (lightning) so these type of load cells might be a more effective device in outdoor environments. This technology is more expensive than other types of load cells. It is a more costly technology and thus cannot effectively compete on a cost of purchase basis.|$|R
