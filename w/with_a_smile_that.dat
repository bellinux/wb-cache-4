500|$|When Lasance {{secured the}} role, he said [...] "Aden causes {{a bit of}} {{mischief}} in the Bay but he's really a good guy." [...] Aden {{has been described as}} a [...] "good looking guy <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>that</b> melts every heart." [...] Aden is initially portrayed as an [...] "anti-social bully with a huge chip on his shoulder" [...] where authority figures are concerned. Aden's mother died while he was young and he was raised by his father Larry Jefferies (Paul Gleeson). Aden is a keen football player, though Larry did not approve or support his ambitions. When Lasance returned to the serial in 2007, he described Aden as being [...] "an absolute bad-arse". When he read the scripts, he thought Aden seemed like an idiot and that viewers would take a dislike to the character. He added that Aden is a strong character and he enjoyed making him [...] "believable". Lasance said that he did not want Aden to turn into a [...] "good guy". The good thing about Aden is the fact [...] "he never quite shakes off the bad-boy image" [...] despite his [...] "different facets".|$|E

Stokowski even got to talk to (and shake hands with) Mickey Mouse on screen, although he would later say <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>that</b> Mickey Mouse got to shake hands with him. This footage of Stokowski was incorporated into Fantasia 2000.|$|E
