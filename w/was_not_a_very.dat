5|$|As in {{the wings}} of modern birds, the flight {{feathers}} of Archaeopteryx were somewhat asymmetrical and the tail feathers were rather broad. This implies that the wings and tail were used for lift generation, but {{it is unclear whether}} Archaeopteryx was capable of flapping flight or simply a glider. The lack of a bony breastbone suggests that Archaeopteryx <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> strong flier, but flight muscles might have attached to the thick, boomerang-shaped wishbone, the platelike coracoids, or perhaps, to a cartilaginous sternum. The sideways orientation of the glenoid (shoulder) joint between scapula, coracoid, and humerus—instead of the dorsally angled arrangement found in modern birds—may indicate that Archaeopteryx was unable to lift its wings above its back, a requirement for the upstroke found in modern flapping flight. According to a study by Philip Senter in 2006, Archaeopteryx was indeed unable to use flapping flight as modern birds do, but it may well have used a downstroke-only flap-assisted gliding technique.|$|E
5|$|He <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good {{businessman}} and although his fame grew statewide, his wealth never swelled to match until he became {{director of the}} Connecticut Retreat. In 1796, shortly after starting his work in Farmington, he married Rachel Hills. In the same year, his half-brother Michael died at sea. In 1797, his sister Polly died of spotted fever. His mother died in 1806. In 1811, Rachel's brother Reuben died, and Todd and his wife adopted his two daughters Theresa and Jennet. Rachel died in 1825, and Todd subsequently married her younger sister, Catherine. She would outlive him by 33 years, dying herself in 1866.|$|E
5|$|Słowacki <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> popular {{figure in}} Paris, nor among his contemporaries. He wrote many dramas, {{which can be}} seen as his {{favorite}} genre, yet he was a playwright who never saw any of his work performed on stage (only Mazepa was staged during his lifetime, and not in his presence). His works, written in Polish, dense with Slavic myths, philosophy and symbols, were difficult to translate to other languages. Słowacki's unpopularity among other Polish émigrés can be attributed to his unwillingness to pander to contemporary tastes; and in particular, his refusal to comfort his compatriots, shaken by the loss of Polish statehood and the failure of the November Uprising. Słowacki's ironic and sometimes pessimistic attitude was not appreciated by his contemporaries, nor was his denial of Polish uniqueness.|$|E

5|$|He went {{one better}} at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, where he beat Fernando Meligeni to win the bronze medal, thus {{becoming}} the first Indian to win an individual medal since KD Jadhav won bronze at the 1952 Helsinki Olympics {{more than four decades}} earlier. Paes cited the match as one of his greatest performances on the court, in part because his wrist was severely injured. He was awarded the highest sporting honour by the government of India, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna in 1996. His first successful year in the ATP circuit came in 1993, when he partnered Sébastien Lareau to reach the US Open doubles semifinal. After having a moderate season in 1994, he reached the quarter-finals of the 1995 Australian Open doubles with Kevin Ullyett. From 1996, he partnered with fellow-Indian Mahesh Bhupathi, which would prove to be a winning combination. Their first year <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> successful one, especially in the Grand Slams, with a round of 32 finish at Wimbledon being the best. 1997 proved to be a much better year for the team of Paes and Bhupathi, with the semifinals of the US Open their best Grand Slam result. Paes climbed the doubles ranking from no. 89 {{at the beginning of the}} year to no. 14 at the end of the year. That year he also made his best singles performance in a Grand Slam, getting to the third round of the 1997 US Open, beating Carlos Costa and Arnaud Boetsch before losing to Cédric Pioline.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the battle}} <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> serious {{blow to the}} Hungarian army and their strategical positions, the Hungarians did not lost their {{military}} initiative completely, but the moral effect of the two lost battles (Zsigárd at 16 June, and Pered at 20–21 June) had a paralyzing effect on their morale, while the imperials who in the Spring campaign lost every battle started again to believe in victory. But the imperials could have been not achieve this victory without the involvement {{in the battle of}} Panyutyin's Russian troops.|$|E
25|$|Yardy {{made his}} Sussex debut in an early-season NatWest Trophy game against Hertfordshire in May 1999, {{although}} it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> successful {{way to begin}} his career: opening the batting, he was lbw for nought and went for 14 from two wicketless overs. He also played a one-day game against Sri Lanka A, again with little success, and though he played a few games the following year {{it was only in}} 2001 that he became anything like a regular in the side. He played ten games in 2002, but only seven in total over the next two years, before returning with a vengeance in 2005.|$|E

He left the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after they offered him a contract that would have still made him among the lowest-paid starters in the league, even though it would have been triple his previous salary. Williams <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> refined, efficient, or consistent passer at that point in addition to being a little rusty, but had a big arm and a knack for making plays.|$|E

25|$|Miјatović's {{wife was}} a member of the Wesleyan Church and was able to imbue her husband with nonconformist {{religious}} devotion. However, he always remained faithful to the Serbian Orthodox Church but wanted to bring some religious zeal into it. That <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> popular task in Serbia of his time. He found a collaborator in this endeavour in the person of a Belgrade priest Aleksa Ilić who established a religious monthly Hrishchanski Vesnik (Christian Messenger, in Serbian Cyrillic: Хришћански весник), the first journal dedicated to religious revival in Serbia. A Scottish philanthropist Francis Mackenzie who settled in Belgrade helped this project materially and Miјatović remained one of the main contributors of the journal.|$|E
25|$|The {{battle of}} Hatvan <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{important}} victory, but {{its influence on}} {{the moral of the}} Hungarian troops was remarkable. The most important result of the battle was that Gáspár succeeded to make Schlik to think that he faced the whole Hungarian army, and not just its VIIth corps. Windisch-Grätz continued to be unsure about the plans and displacement of the Hungarian main army, and because of this he remained mostly incapable of stopping them to advance from two sides, towards his headquarters at Gödöllő. After the victory of Hatvan, the other, more numerous Hungarian army, consisting of three corps, won at Tápióbicske another victory, than neared to Isaszeg, where, on 6 April, the decisive battle of {{the first phase of the}} Spring Campaign took place.|$|E
25|$|Of the {{developed}} cores of the Old world, India was distinguished by its caste system of bound labor, which hampered economic {{and population growth}} and resulted in relative underdevelopment compared to other core regions. Compared with other developed regions, India still possessed large amounts of unused resources. India's caste system gave an incentive to elites to drive their unfree laborers harder when faced with increased demand, rather than invest in new capital projects and technology. The Indian economy was characterized by vassal-lord relationships, which weakened the motive of financial profit {{and the development of}} markets; a talented artisan or merchant could not hope to gain much personal reward. Pomeranz argues that India <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> likely site for an industrial breakthrough, despite its sophisticated commerce and technologies.|$|E

25|$|He was {{a leading}} base stealer {{in the first half}} of his career. He was also able to hit triples, {{reaching}} double figures four times. As he became slower in later years while his body grew and his injuries mounted, Gwynn would anticipate pitchers' moves and would sometimes steal bases by breaking for second base before the pitcher started delivering the ball to the hitter. Defensively, he improved considerably and was among the best right fielders at quickly going to the line, cutting the ball off, and throwing to second base. He worked on his defense, constantly checking right field walls in ballparks to study how balls bounced off them. His running ability also helped him on defense. When he entered the majors, Gwynn <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good right fielder nor an accurate thrower. For a long time, he worked on his defense harder than he did his hitting. While he was a natural hitter, he was most proud of his five Gold Gloves, calling his first one from 1986 his most treasured piece of memorabilia. He became a perennial leader in outfield assists. Although his arm was not particularly strong, he learned to use his body to build momentum into his throws. In college, he could not even throw the ball from center field to second base without it hopping first.|$|E
25|$|Oroonoko <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> {{substantial}} {{success at}} first. The stand-alone edition, {{according to the}} English Short Title Catalog online, was not followed by a new edition until 1696. Behn, who had hoped to recoup {{a significant amount of}} money from the book, was disappointed. Sales picked up in the second year after her death, and the novel then went through three printings. The story was used by Thomas Southerne for a tragedy entitled Oroonoko: A Tragedy. Southerne's play was staged in 1695 and published in 1696, with a foreword in which Southerne expresses his gratitude to Behn and praises her work. The play was a great success. After the play was staged, a new edition of the novel appeared, and it was never out of print in the 18th century afterward. The adaptation is generally faithful to the novel, with one significant exception: it makes Imoinda white instead of black (see Macdonald), and therefore, like Othello, the male lead would perform in blackface to a white heroine. As the taste of the 1690s demanded, Southerne emphasises scenes of pathos, especially those involving the tragic heroine, such as the scene where Oroonoko kills Imoinda. At the same time, in standard Restoration theatre rollercoaster manner, the play intersperses these scenes with a comic and sexually explicit subplot. The subplot was soon cut from stage representations with the changing taste of the 18th century, but the tragic tale of Oroonoko and Imoinda remained popular on the stage.|$|E
500|$|Known as [...] "Dirty Bertie" [...] {{because of}} his {{physical}} playing style, Olmstead was a power forward, making hard hits and winning battles in the corners.

500|$|One of Olivier's contemporaries at {{the school}} was Peggy Ashcroft, who {{observed}} he was [...] "rather uncouth in that his sleeves were too short and his hair stood on end but he was intensely lively and great fun". By his own admission, he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> conscientious student, but Fogerty liked him and later {{said that he and}} Ashcroft stood out among her many pupils. On leaving the school after a year, Olivier gained work with small touring companies before being taken on in 1925 by Sybil Thorndike and her husband, Lewis Casson, as a bit-part player, understudy and assistant stage manager for their London company. He modelled his performing style on that of Gerald du Maurier, of whom he said, [...] "He seemed to mutter on stage but had such perfect technique. When I started I was so busy doing a du Maurier that no one ever heard a word I said. The Shakespearean actors one saw were terrible hams like Frank Benson." [...] His concern to speak naturally and avoid what he called [...] "singing" [...] Shakespeare's verse was the cause of much frustration in his early career, with critics regularly decrying his delivery.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} {{towards the}} character was generally mixed. In a DVD {{review of the}} first series, Michael Mackenzie of Home Cinema thought Macfadyen <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good actor and believed [...] "he {{seems to be in}} some sort of contest with Keanu Reeves to see how long he can maintain the same lifeless facial expression," [...] but thought the character himself, particularly his personal life, mostly worked well for the most part as it continues [...] "as a standard soap opera." [...] In review of the second series, Dennis Landmann of MovieFreak praised the [...] "drama and intensity that builds around his character," [...] noting Tom's somewhat [...] "haunted soul" [...] and the last five minutes of the last episode [...] "were so powerful they affected how I felt {{for the next couple of}} days; I kept thinking about the character and the tragic events that happened to him." [...] In the third series, Mackenzie praised the episode where Tom tries to clear his name, but thought his exit was [...] "not particularly satisfying." [...] However, David Blackwell of Enterline Media thought that his farewell scene was [...] "one of [...] best moments of the first two episode (in addition to the way Tom acts in the opening episode)." ...|$|E
