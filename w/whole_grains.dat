According to the AACCI, <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> includes cereal grains that consist of ground, cracker or intact grains, which incorporate all {{of the components of}} natural grain, including the endosperm, bran and germ (American Association of Cereal Chemists (AACC) International 2000). The components are present in the same relative proportions in <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> cereals as they exist in the intact grain.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: A diet rich in <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> cereals is {{suggested}} {{to protect against}} type 2 diabetes and facilitate body weight regulation. However, {{little is known about}} the impact of different cereals and the underlying mechanisms. The objective of this study was to compare the long-term metabolic effects of diets supplemented with <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> wheat or <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> rye in the C 57 BL/ 6 J mouse. METHODS: Mice were fed the <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> supplements in a low-fat background diet for 22 wk. Oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests were performed during the study and in vitro insulin secretion assays were performed at the end of the study. Body weight, energy intake, body fat content, and plasma parameters were measured during the study. RESULTS: A dietary supplement of <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> rye suppressed body weight gain and resulted in significantly decreased adiposity, plasma leptin, total plasma cholesterol, and triacylglycerols compared with a supplement of <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> wheat. Also, a slight improvement in insulin sensitivity was observed in the rye group compared with the wheat group. The decreases in body weight and adiposity were observed in the absence of differences in energy intake. CONCLUSION: Long-term administration of <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> rye evokes a different metabolic profile compared with <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> wheat in the C 57 BL/ 6 J mouse, the primary difference being that <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> rye reduces body weight and adiposity compared with <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> wheat.

The median daily <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> intake, calculated for each individual on a dry weight basis, was 20 g/d for adults and 13 g/d for children/teenagers. The corresponding energy-adjusted <b>whole</b> <b>grain</b> intake was 27 g/ 10 MJ per d for adults and 20 g/ 10 MJ per d for children/teenagers. <b>Whole</b> <b>grain</b> intake (absolute and energy-adjusted) increased with age, but was lowest in teenagers (13 - 17 years) and younger adults up to the age of 34 years.

25|$|Dietary fiber is a {{carbohydrate}} that is incompletely {{absorbed in}} humans {{and in some}} animals. Like all carbohydrates, when it is metabolized it can produce four Calories (kilocalories) of energy per gram. However, in most circumstances it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility. Dietary fiber consists mainly of cellulose, a large carbohydrate polymer which is indigestible as humans {{do not have the}} required enzymes to disassemble it. There are two subcategories: soluble and insoluble fiber. <b>Whole</b> <b>grains,</b> fruits (especially plums, prunes, and figs), and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber. There are many health benefits of a high-fiber diet. Dietary fiber helps reduce the chance of gastrointestinal problems such as constipation and diarrhea by increasing the weight and size of stool and softening it. Insoluble fiber, found in whole wheat flour, nuts and vegetables, especially stimulates peristalsis;– the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines, which move digest along the digestive tract. Soluble fiber, found in oats, peas, beans, and many fruits, dissolves in water in the intestinal tract to produce a gel that slows the movement of food through the intestines. This may help lower blood glucose levels because it can slow the absorption of sugar. Additionally, fiber, perhaps especially that from <b>whole</b> <b>grains,</b> is thought to possibly help lessen insulin spikes, and therefore reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. The link between increased fiber consumption and a decreased risk of colorectal cancer is still uncertain.|$|E

Other food sources that contain copper include cereals, potatoes, peas, red meat, mushrooms, some dark green leafy vegetables (such as kale), and fruits (coconuts, papaya and apples).
