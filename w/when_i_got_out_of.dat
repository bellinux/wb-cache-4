500|$|After divorcing Ike in 1978, Tina abstained {{from serious}} {{relationships}} {{for a long}} time, as she set on bringing her career back on track. In 1986 she said, [...] "People {{have to realize that}} I just got out of a very difficult marriage. I'm not the type of woman who needs to jump back into another. I liked my freedom <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that one. I've had a few love affairs, but nothing important." ...|$|E
500|$|Harrison's final studio album for EMI and Apple Records was {{the soul}} music-inspired Extra Texture (Read All About It) (1975). He {{considered}} it the least satisfactory {{of the three}} he had recorded since All Things Must Pass. Leng identified [...] "bitterness and dismay" [...] {{in many of the}} album's tracks; his long-time friend Klaus Voormann commented: [...] "He wasn't up for it... It was a terrible time because I think {{there was a lot of}} cocaine going around, and that's <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the picture... I didn't like his frame of mind". He released two singles from the LP: [...] "You", which reached the Billboard top 20, and [...] "This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)", Apple's final original single release.|$|E
500|$|Joan Ganz {{was born}} on November 30, 1929 in Phoenix, Arizona, to Sylvan Ganz, a banker, and Pauline (née Reddon), a homemaker. Her father was a native Phoenician {{who was born in}} the U.S. so that his mother could receive medical care after his birth. [...] Her {{grandfather}} Emil Ganz was a tailor from Walldorf, Thuringia [...] in Germany, who immigrated to the U.S. in 1858 and was president of the First National Bank of Arizona and mayor of Phoenix for three terms. [...] Joan Ganz was the youngest of three siblings. [...] She described her childhood as [...] "upper middle class, country club atmosphere" [...] and stated, [...] "I was raised in the most conventional way, raised to be a housewife and a mother, to work an interesting job <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> college, and to marry at the appropriate age, which would have been twenty-five". Her father was Jewish and her mother was Catholic.|$|E
60|$|FALDER. [Sullenly] I {{meant to}} write <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> there--I would have repaid the money.|$|R
60|$|My indignation ebbed away, {{and into}} my being rushed the tides of fear. I saw at last, clear-eyed, what I was up against. I grew meek and lowly. Each day I {{resolved}} more emphatically to make no rumpus <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out.</b> All <b>I</b> asked, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out,</b> {{was a chance to}} fade away from the landscape. And that was just what <b>I</b> did do <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was released. I kept my tongue between my teeth, walked softly, and sneaked for Pennsylvania, a wiser and a humbler man.|$|R
60|$|Nothing {{particular}} {{happened on}} our journey to London, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> at the station, a tall footman, whose face I remembered, {{came up and}} touched his hat, and asked what luggage I had.|$|R
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the room}} I felt limply flat, like a {{squeezed}} lemon, and the doorkeeper in his glass cage, where I stopped {{to get my}} hat and tip him a shilling, said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There was a {{gleam of}} {{sunshine}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the van yesterday. I never knew before what sunshine was. I {{hope it will}} be a sunny day when I go out for the last time!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was late}} {{yesterday}} evening before I arrived at Bingen. A servant {{was waiting to}} take my portmanteau, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the coach. After first asking my name, he communicated to me the melancholy tidings of dear Mr. Engelman's death. He had sunk under a fit of apoplexy, at an early hour that morning.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> at my station I {{felt for}} the first time ill at ease. Why was I getting out at this wayside place, on to the great, raw high-road? I did not know. But I set off walking. It was nearly tea-time.|$|R
6000|$|... 'But that's not all! I {{saw them}} again under the gas <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out.</b> <b>I</b> was very near {{trying to speak}} to her, but I lost sight {{of her in the}} throng; but I saw that face so like Master Michael, only scared and just ready to cry.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't call it home, Miss Mohun,' he said. 'I {{have not}} had that these many years; but I declare, the first sound of our county dialect, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> at the station, made my heart leap into my mouth. I could have shaken hands with the fellow.' ...|$|R
6000|$|It DID break too, {{and down}} I {{came into the}} slush; and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it, I can tell you I didn't look much like the Venuses or the Apollor Belvidearis what I used to dress and titivate up for my shop window when I was in the {{hairdressing}} line, or smell quite so elegant as our rose-oil. Faugh! what a figure I was! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One would think," [...] {{he muttered}} to himself, [...] "that little preacher is an {{emissary}} of Satan himself. Go where I will, this lantern-jawed knave {{is sure to}} crop up and I feel convinced that until I have split his skull I shall have no safety. I thought I had freed myself of Mm forever <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> London; and here, {{in the middle of}} the Scotch capital, he turns up as sharpsighted and as venomous as ever." ...|$|E
6000|$|SOLDIER. So I 'ave. My Gawd! It's a {{way they}} 'ave in the Army. I said <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it I'd laugh. Like as the sun itself I used to think of you, Daisy, when the trumps was comin' over, and the wind was up. D'you {{remember}} that {{last night in the}} wood? [...] "Come back and marry me quick, Jack." [...] Well, here I am--got me pass to heaven. No more fightin', no more drillin', no more sleepin' rough. We can get married now, Daisy. We can live soft an' 'appy. Give us a kiss, my dear.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> {{into the}} street and met the {{disgorging}} picture-palaces capering on the pavements and humming it (for he had put the gramophones on with the films), and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> saw far to the south the red electrics flash 'Gubby' across the Thames, I feared more than ever.|$|R
5000|$|He {{explained}} his stage name {{in an interview}} with ThisIsRnB: [...] "Earl St.Clair came from the irony from the fact that where I started producing in Cleveland, the street I was working on was St. Clair. It was 129 and St. Clair. Then <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> to California … the studio that I was working in was located on St Clair." ...|$|R
60|$|I saw {{no sign of}} {{the girl}} in the plantation. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out,</b> through the sand-hills, on to the beach, there she was, in her little straw bonnet, and her plain grey cloak that she always wore to hide her {{deformed}} shoulder as much as might be--there she was, all alone, looking out on the quicksand and the sea.|$|R
6000|$|... "Deil haet do I expect--excepting that a' the gentles {{will come}} to the gaberlunzie's burial; and maybe ye'll carry the head yoursell, as ye did puir Steenie Mucklebackit's.--What trouble was't to me? I was ganging about at ony rate--Oh, but I was blythe <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Prison, though; for I thought, what if that weary letter should come when I am closed up here like an oyster, and a' should gang wrang for want o't? and whiles I thought I maun mak a clean breast and tell you a' about it; but then I couldna weel do that without contravening Mr. Lovel's {{positive}} orders; and I reckon he had to see somebody at Edinburgh afore he could do what he wussed to do for Sir Arthur and his family." ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{were all}} on board the Asia, for trial, or investigation, two days, before I was sent for into the cabin. I was very much frightened; and scarce knew what I said, or did. It is a cruel thing to leave sailors without counsel, on such occasions; though the {{officers}} behaved very kindly and considerately to me; and, I believe, to all of us. There were several officers seated round a table; and all were in swabs. They said, the gentleman who presided, was a Sir Borlase Warren, the admiral on the station.[11] This gentleman, whoever he was, probably saw that I was frightened. He slewed himself round, in his chair, and said to me; [...] "My man, you need not be alarmed; we know who you are, and what you are; but your apprenticeship will be of great service to you." [...] This was not said, however, until Sir Thomas Hardy had got out {{the story of my}} being an apprentice in Jacob Barker's employ, again, before them all, in the cabin. I was told to send for a copy of my indentures, by one of the white-washed Swedes, that sailed between Bermuda and New York. This I did, that very day. I was in the cabin of the Asia, half an hour, perhaps; and I felt greatly relieved, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it. It was decided, in my presence, to send me back among the prisoners, on board the Ardent. The same decision was made, as to the whole eight of us, that had come on in the Regulus.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tomorrow. I'm glad she's coming--but it will {{be another}} change. Marilla and I cleared {{everything}} out of the spare room yesterday. Do you know, I hated to do it? Of course, it was silly--but it did seem {{as if we were}} committing sacrilege. That old spare room has always seemed like a shrine to me. When I was a child I thought it the most wonderful apartment in the world. You remember what a consuming desire I had to sleep in a spare room bed--but not the Green Gables spare room. Oh, no, never there! It would have been too terrible--I couldn't have slept a wink from awe. I never WALKED through that room when Marilla sent me in on an errand--no, indeed, I tiptoed through it and held my breath, as if I were in church, and felt relieved <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it. The pictures of George Whitefield and the Duke of Wellington hung there, one {{on each side of the}} mirror, and frowned so sternly at me all the time I was in, especially if I dared peep in the mirror, which was the only one in the house that didn't twist my face a little. I always wondered how Marilla dared houseclean that room. And now it's not only cleaned but stripped bare. George Whitefield and the Duke have been relegated to the upstairs hall. 'So passes the glory of this world,'" [...] concluded Anne, with a laugh in which there was a little note of regret. It is never pleasant to have our old shrines desecrated, even when we have outgrown them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh. This was curious: <b>When</b> <b>I</b> {{took off}} my dress last night--it was a darling dress, I loved it so, {{but of course the}} mud had spoiled it. I cried over it and----No matter. But my white silk {{stockings}} were all torn, and the strange thing is, I don't know whether I caught my legs in the briers <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> to look at the sign-post, or whether Cy scratched me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was fighting him off." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{hesitated a}} little before he replied. [...] "Well, I was always {{interested}} in them, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> among the Payonnay I tried to get at their notions of life; {{but they are a}} strange people--a secretive people--and I couldn't win their confidence for a long time. One day while on a hunting expedition I came suddenly upon a crew of wood-choppers who had an old man tied to a tree and were about to burn him alive--" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> {{into the}} dark, where my hot face cooled in the wind, my relief equaled my other feelings. Sampson {{had told me}} to clear out, and {{although}} I did not {{take that as a}} dismissal I considered I would be wise to leave the ranch at once. Daylight might disclose my footprints between the walls, but even if it did not, my work there was finished. So I went to my room and packed my few belongings.|$|R
60|$|It {{was only}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the {{building}} that I began to walk on air. And the human animal being averse from change and timid before the unknown, I said to myself that I really would not mind being examined by the same man on a future occasion. But when the time of ordeal came round again the doorkeeper let me into another room, with the now familiar paraphernalia of models of ships and tackle, a board for signals on the wall, a big, long table covered with official forms and having an unrigged mast fixed to the edge. The solitary tenant was unknown to me by sight, though not by reputation, which was simply execrable. Short and sturdy, as far as I could judge, clad in an old brown morning-suit, he sat leaning on his elbow, his hand shading his eyes, and half averted from the chair I was to occupy {{on the other side}} of the table. He was motionless, mysterious, remote, enigmatical, with something mournful, too, in the pose, like that statue of Giugliano (I think) de Medici shading his face on the tomb by Michael Angelo, though, of course, he was far, far from being beautiful. He began by trying to make me talk nonsense. But I had been warned of that fiendish trait, and contradicted him with great assurance. After a while he left off. So far good. But his immobility, the thick elbow on the table, the abrupt, unhappy voice, the shaded and averted face grew more and more impressive. He kept inscrutably silent for a moment, and then, placing me in a ship of a certain size, at sea, under conditions of weather, season, locality, etc.--all very clear and precise--ordered me to execute a certain manoeuvre. Before I was half through with it he did some material damage to the ship. Directly I had grappled with the difficulty he caused another to present itself, and when that, too, was met he stuck another ship before me, creating a very dangerous situation. I felt slightly outraged by this ingenuity in piling trouble upon a man.|$|E
5000|$|Serling's combat {{experience}} affected him {{deeply and}} influenced {{much of his}} writing. It left him with nightmares and flashbacks {{for the rest of}} his life. He said, [...] "I was bitter about everything and at loose ends <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the service. I think I turned to writing to get it off my chest." ...|$|E
5000|$|An {{excerpt of}} a private letter Dave wrote to a Mr. Trosley around the time he started up the Byron Band (1981):"I don't really know much about Lawton and Sloman, cause <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Heep I wanted to {{remember}} the good parts and f**k the rest. Everybody {{over the years has}} got fired or whatever only Mick is left and even I don't know whether he is going to try again. I'm very good friends with all of them now but it took a while." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was quite}} dark, {{when we all}} sprang ashore; and, for the first time, I felt dusty {{particles}} of the renowned British soil penetrating into my eyes and lungs. As for stepping on it, {{that was out of}} the question, in the well-paved and flagged condition of the streets; and I did not have an opportunity to do so till some time afterward, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> into the country; and then, indeed, I saw England, and snuffed its immortal loam-but not till then.|$|R
60|$|She {{laughed a}} little, quite good-naturedly, {{and with the}} sort of tranquillity obvious in all she did--a tranquillity which soothed and suited me singularly, at least I thought so that evening. Brussels seemed a very {{pleasant}} place to me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> again into the street, and it appeared as if some cheerful, eventful, upward-tending career were even then opening to me, on that selfsame mild, still April night. So impressionable a being is man, or at least such a man as I was in those days.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is good to}} see you {{pulling out}} all right," [...] {{answered}} Alfred. [...] "I tell you, I feared you were in a bad way <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> you <b>out</b> of the water." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{think it}} was a racing {{incident}} at best," [...] Franchitti said in victory lane. [...] "I don't think I'm known throughout the paddock as a driver who races people dirty. I will say, in his defense, had that happened to me today, I would have been steamed <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the car too. Particularly if I'd crashed later in the race. ... I understand his anger, but hopefully when he watches the replay on television he'll realize it was a racing incident." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{receiving}} the Album of the Year award {{at the first}} Alternative Press Music Awards in 2014, Sykes revealed a history of addiction and abuse of the drug Ketamine. Addressing the crowd, he said [...] "My band wanted to kill me, my parents wanted to kill me, my fucking brother wanted to kill me," [...] and also admitted, [...] "I went to rehab for a month, and you guys were sending me texts and e-mails. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that rehab, I didn't want to scream anymore, I wanted to sing from the fucking rooftops." ...|$|E
5000|$|With {{professional}} basketball {{out of the}} picture, McCurdy focused on becoming a successful businessman. Later in life, after admitting to skipping classes while in college {{to work on his}} jump shot, he said, [...] "I was almost incoherent <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> college. Here I was, hoping to be a businessman, and I couldn't even talk basketball." [...] So he hired a tutor to catch him back up to speed in statistics, and within a few years he was a successful employee at Katz Marketing Solutions. He eventually moved his way {{all the way up to}} his current position of company president.|$|E
60|$|I {{achieved}} {{a condition in}} which my body was never free from alcohol. Nor did I permit myself to be away from alcohol. If I travelled to out-of-the-way places, I declined to run the risk of finding them dry. I took a quart, or several quarts, along in my grip. In the past I had been amazed by other men guilty of this practice. Now I did it myself unblushingly. And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> with the fellows, I cast all rules by the board. <b>I</b> drank <b>when</b> they drank, what they drank, and in the same way they drank.|$|R
5000|$|While {{visiting her}} uncle, British Ambassador Sir Peter Wilkinson, in Vietnam in 1968, Diana Villiers met John Negroponte {{at a dinner}} given in her honor and he [...] "explained the {{constitutional}} assembly throughout the whole meal!" [...] she said. [...] "I was terrified -- and bored. Terrified that he might ask me something I didn't know the answer to, and bored because I was just a 21-year-old." [...] She recalled, [...] "The next day he's on the same Pan Am flight I am, going to Paris. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> 19 hours later in Paris, I was heads over heels {{in love with this}} guy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{long and}} short of my {{business}} with him," [...] said Martin, [...] "was this: I went with {{him down to the}} lake, and there I gave him a piece of my mind; and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had finished, he turned on me and grabbed me with his two hands and chucked me out into the water, just as if I had been a bag of bad meal that he wanted to get rid of. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>I</b> was going to fight him, but he advised me not to, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> took a look at him and remembered the feel of the swing he gave me, I took his advice.
