25|$|Howard Kleinburg, {{an author}} and Miami Beach {{historian}} described Fisher: If you look at Fisher's entire life, it's a marathon. It's a race. It was a race to achieve the top of whatever field he was in at the time. Everything he did he went into it with his heart, his soul, his money, {{and he would not}} stop until he reached the end. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> the quickest and first...|$|E
2500|$|Richthofen's {{participation}} on {{the operation}} {{came to an}} abrupt end on 23 June 1942. Having been informed by Jeschonnek and Hitler that he was to assume command of Luftlfotte 4 after the fall of Sevastopol earlier, they decided not to wait. They ordered him to Kursk in order to take up his command, leaving his Corps behind, and Sevastopol air operations under the command of von Wild. Richthofen was disgusted. He felt it was ridiculous to move him mid-operation, and he had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> when the fortress fell. He wrote, [...] "It is a pity that one can never finish what one starts in the east. After a while, it takes away all the pleasure".|$|E
2500|$|Some of {{her music}} {{business}} friends have included Dionne Warwick, Mavis Staples, and Cissy Houston, who began singing with Franklin {{as members of}} the Sweet Inspirations. Cissy sang background on Franklin's classic hit [...] "Ain't No Way". Franklin first met Cissy's daughter, Whitney, in the early 1970s. She was made Whitney's honorary aunt, and Whitney often referred to her as [...] "Auntie Ree". Whitney died on February 11, 2012. Franklin stated she was surprised by her death. She had initially planned to perform at Houston's memorial service on February 18, but her representative claimed that Franklin suffered a leg spasm and was unable to attend. In response to criticism of her non-attendance, she stated, [...] "God knows I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there,</b> but I couldn't." ...|$|E

2500|$|The tour {{agent was}} Ingrid Hart, who {{recalled}} that [...] " [...] <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> with her boyfriend, {{they were going}} to get some money together and get married". On 20 July 1969, Sweethearts on Parade were performing for about 75 US Marines at a Non-commissioned officer's club 7km (4mi) south-east of Da Nang in South Vietnam. At about 9:15p.m., Wayne had just finished a song and was still on stage to introduce her fellow performers when she was shot in the chest by a bullet fired from a [...]22 pistol, fitted with a silencer, which had been stolen at the base. Wayne died almost instantly as the bullet severed her aorta. In Entertaining Vietnam, a 2003 documentary directed and produced by Mara Wallis, Taylor was interviewed on the events of Wayne's death, footage of a Sweethearts on Parade performance with Wayne singing was shown (see screenshot at left). Taylor recalled that he was sitting about a metre (three feet) behind Wayne and that Cavanagh had stepped forward to cradle his fianc√©e when she slumped to the floor.|$|E
6000|$|Evidently {{there was}} no want of desire to speed the departing guest. [...] "Oh, I will attend to that myself," [...] said I, but I made no step to do it. When my hostess came back I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
60|$|The cortege {{left the}} room in silence. Mrs. Crocker had touched the bell, but the mourners did not wait {{for the arrival of}} Bayliss. They were in no mood for the formalities of polite Society. They wanted to be elsewhere, and they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> quick. The front door had closed behind them before the butler reached the morning-room.|$|E

60|$|We {{went down}} to Ginx's in the first boat, having {{arranged}} that our furniture {{should be sent to}} us in the afternoon. We <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> to receive it. The trip was just wildly delirious. The air was charming. The sun was bright, and I had a whole holiday. When we reached Ginx's we found {{that the best way to}} get our trunks and ourselves to our house was to take a carriage, and so we took one. I told the driver to drive along the river road and I would tell him where to stop.|$|E
60|$|Morton {{and his men}} {{sent word}} flying around town that a fight was {{imminent}} and all citizens {{should be prepared to}} defend their homes against possible violence. But despite his warning I saw many respectable citizens abroad whose quiet, unobtrusive manner and watchful eyes and hard faces told me that when trouble began they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there.</b> Verily Ranger Steele had built his house of service upon a rock. It did not seem too much to say that the next few days, perhaps hours, would see a great change in the character and a proportionate decrease in number of the inhabitants of this corner of Pecos County.|$|E
60|$|I {{wanted to}} stay in Carleton. I loved the big, straggling, bustling little town that always {{reminded}} me of a lanky, overgrown schoolboy, all arms and legs, but full to the brim with enthusiasm and splendid ideas. I knew Carleton was bound to grow into a magnificent city, and I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> and see it grow and watch it develop; and I loved the whole big, breezy golden west, with the rush and tingle of its young life. And, more than all, I loved my boys, and what I was going to do without them or they without me was more than I knew, though I tried to think Providence might know.|$|E

25|$|The {{one that}} {{finished}} my career was when I got hit in my eye by John Maguire from Queensland...He got one to really rear up, and I {{got back to}} hook and it went between the visor and the top part of the helmet and smashed in my eye. That finished me. After that, I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there.</b> I thought of other things I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do in life. Even though I continued playing on in Shield {{for two or three}} years, I just didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there.</b>|$|R

60|$|Joyce, the eldest, {{was still}} his favourite. She {{was now a}} {{quicksilver}} little thing of six years old. Barbara, the youngest, was a toddler of two years. They {{spent most of their}} time down at Crockham, because he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there.</b> And even Winifred loved the place really. But now, in her frustrated and blinded state, it was full of menace for her children. The adders, the poison-berries, the brook, the marsh, the water that might not be pure--one thing and another. From mother and nurse it was a guerilla gunfire of commands, and blithe, quicksilver disobedience from the three blonde, never-still little girls. Behind the girls was the father, against mother and nurse. And so it was.|$|E
60|$|How to do this, {{or how to}} {{take with}} him the {{treasure}} of the Incas, was a puzzling question with which the captain racked his brains by day and by night. At last he bethought himself of the Rackbirds' vessel. He remembered that Maka {{had told him that}} provisions were brought to them by a vessel, and there was every reason to suppose that when these miscreants went on some of their marauding expeditions they travelled by sea. Day by day he had thought that he would go and visit the Rackbirds' storehouse and the neighborhood thereabout, but day by day he had been afraid that in his absence Rynders might arrive, and when he came he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> to meet him.|$|E
60|$|Next day Lenore {{did not go}} out to {{the harvest}} fields. She {{expected}} Dorn might arrive at any time, and she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> when he came. Yet she dreaded the meeting. She had to keep her hands active that day, so in some measure to control her mind. A thousand times she felt herself on the verge of thrilling and flushing. Her fancy and imagination seemed wonderfully active. The day was more than usually golden, crowned with an azure blue, like the blue of the Pacific. She worked in her room, helped her mother, took up her knitting, and sewed upon a dress, and even lent a hand in the kitchen. But action could not wholly dull the song in her heart. She felt unutterably young, as if life had just opened, with haunting, limitless, beautiful possibilities. Never had the harvest-time been so sweet.|$|E

60|$|The captain {{got into}} the mound with a lantern, for the gold was now too low for him to reach it from above, and having put as many bars into a coffee-bag as a man could carry, he passed it up to Burke, who slid {{it down to the}} floor, where another lantern had been left. When five bags had been made ready, the captain came out, and he and Burke put each bag into another, and these were tied up firmly at each end, for a single coffee-bag was not {{considered}} strong enough to hold the weighty treasure. Then the two carried the bags into the part of the cave which was lighted by the great fissure, and called the negroes. Then, each taking a bag on his shoulder, the party returned to the cove. On the next trip, Shirley decided to go with the captain, for {{he said he did not}} care for anything if he did not have to look down into the mound, for that was sure to make him dizzy. Maka's place was taken by the negro who had been previously left in the vessel. Day by day the work went on, but whoever might be relieved, and whatever arrangements might be made, the captain always {{got into the}} mound and handed out the gold. Whatever discovery should be made when the bottom of the deposit was reached, he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> to make it.|$|E
