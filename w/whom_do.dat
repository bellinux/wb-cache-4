5|$|Mario is {{the main}} {{character}} of The Thousand-Year Door, although the game will frequently cut to Princess Peach in the X-Naut Fortress. Much time is spent on her interaction with the computer TEC, which has suffered from a glitch and has {{fallen in love with}} Peach, much to her surprise. The main antagonist of the Mario series, Bowser, tries to collect the Crystal Stars before Mario does instead of directly opposing Mario, though his attempts mostly become comedic relief. Luigi's role in the game consists of recounting his slapstick adventures in the Waffle Kingdom, and appears with party members of his own, many of <b>whom</b> <b>do</b> not like Luigi at all for unrelated reasons, juxtaposing the universal respect Mario's partners have for Mario.|$|E
25|$|Chabad {{has set up}} an {{extensive}} network of camps around the world, most using the name Gan Israel, a name chosen by Schneerson although the first overnight camp was the girls division called Camp Emunah.

25|$|Once Rookie week is complete, rookies {{must still}} attend track times {{for at least}} 75% of their {{availability}} up until the Wednesday {{during the week of}} the race. Again, riders <b>whom</b> <b>do</b> not comply with this will earn their team a two-second penalty. This is to ensure that all riders are still practicing and so that the rookies can get used to sharing the track with the veteran riders.|$|E
25|$|The newly resettled peasants {{had largely}} failed to secure loans from {{commercial}} banks {{because they did}} not have title over the land on which they were resettled, and thus could not use it as collateral. With no security of tenure on the farms, banks have been reluctant to extend loans to the new farmers, many of <b>whom</b> <b>do</b> not have much experience in commercial farming, nor assets to provide alternative collateral for any borrowed money.|$|E
25|$|The chief {{reason why}} people with {{diabetes}} develop high blood pressure is hardening of the arteries. Diabetes tends {{to speed up the}} process of atherosclerosis. The other fact about diabetes is that it affects both large and small blood vessels in the body. Over time, blood vessels become clogged with fatty depots, become non-compliant and lose their elasticity. The process of atherosclerosis is a lot faster in diabetic individuals <b>whom</b> <b>do</b> not have good control of their blood sugars. The high blood pressure eventually leads to heart failure, strokes, heart attacks, blindness, kidney failure, loss of libido and poor circulation of blood in the legs. When the blood supply to the feet is compromised, the chances of infections and amputations also increases. All diabetics should know that even mild elevations in blood pressure can be detrimental to health. Studies have shown that diabetics with even a slight elevation in blood pressure have 2-3 times {{the risk of heart disease}} compared to individuals without diabetes.|$|E

500|$|The dynamic {{nature of}} the {{characters}} was a unique element of writing in the series at the time. Once they were established in the twelve episodes of the first season, characters began to change and relationships were developed in the second. This continued through the series {{to the point of}} unpredictability that sometimes became unsettling to fans. Buffy essayist Marguerite Krause asserts that the monsters and demons faced by the Scoobies are thin symbolism for the show's true focus: relationships and how to maintain or ruin them. Common among most of these relationships—romantic, platonic, and familial—is, according to Krause, a [...] "failure to communicate, lack of trust, [...] inability to envision or create a viable future". Miscommunication is worsened or sustained through multiple episodes and seasons, leading to overwhelming misunderstanding and critical turning points for the characters, some of <b>whom</b> <b>do</b> not recover.|$|E
500|$|Reflecting on Mateiu's growing popularity, Matei Călinescu {{has argued}} that Craii... is to Romanian {{literature}} what El Aleph is in the eponymous Jorge Luis Borges story: a place containing all other conceivable places. In his 2008 synthesis, Istoria critică a literaturii române ("The Critical History of Romanian Literature"), Nicolae Manolescu revisits George Călinescu's pronouncements on interwar literature. Manolescu places Mateiu Caragiale, Max Blecher, Anton Holban and Ion Pillat, all of <b>whom</b> <b>do</b> not take the forefront in Călinescu's work, among their generation's [...] "canonical writers". A diverging opinion was expressed by literary critic and Anglicist Mircea Mihăieș, who suggested that, despite the theoretical potential presented by Mateiu's lifestyle and background, Craii... is primarily a poorly written work, characterized by [...] "a disconcerting naïvite", [...] "kitsch" [...] aesthetics and [...] "embarrassing affectations". Mihăieș, who believes that Caragiale's only valuable writings are Pajere and his private correspondence, further suggests that Caragiale's various admirers, including exegetes such as Matei Călinescu, Vasile Lovinescu, Ovidiu Cotruș and Ion Negoițescu, are responsible for overvaluing their favorite author.|$|E
500|$|In {{the gospel}} accounts, Jesus devotes {{a large portion}} of his {{ministry}} performing miracles, especially healings. The miracles can be classified into two main categories: healing miracles and nature miracles. The healing miracles include cures for physical ailments, exorcisms, and resurrections of the dead. The nature miracles show Jesus' power over nature, and include turning water into wine, walking on water, and calming a storm, among others. Jesus states that his miracles are from a divine source. When Jesus' opponents suddenly accuse him of performing exorcisms by the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons, Jesus counters that he performs them by the [...] "Spirit of God" [...] (...) or [...] "finger of God", arguing that all logic suggests that Satan would not let his demons assist the Children of God because it would divide Satan's house and bring his kingdom to desolation; furthermore, he asks his opponents that if he exorcises by Beel'zebub, [...] "by <b>whom</b> <b>do</b> your sons cast them out?" [...] (...) [...] In , {{he goes on to say}} that while all manner of sin, [...] "even insults against God" [...] or [...] "insults against the son of man", shall be forgiven, whoever insults goodness (or [...] "The Holy Spirit") shall never be forgiven; he/she carries the guilt of his/her sin forever.|$|E

2500|$|Quite the {{opposite}} of being more inclusive, opposition parties and human rights groups contend that the new English name [...] "Myanmar" [...] is actually disrespectful of the minorities of Burma. Minorities, many of <b>whom</b> <b>do</b> not speak Burmese, had become accustomed to the English name [...] "Burma" [...] over the years, and they perceive the new name [...] "Myanmar" [...] as a purely Burmese name reflecting the policy of domination of the ethnic Burman majority over the minorities.|$|E
2500|$|The name [...] "homeownership rate" [...] can be misleading. As {{defined by}} the US Census Bureau, it is the {{percentage}} of homes that are occupied by the owner. It is not the percentage of adults that own their own home. This latter percentage will be {{significantly lower than the}} homeownership rate because many households that are owner-occupied contain adult relatives (often young adults, descendents of the owner) who do not own their own home, and because single building multi-bedroom rental units can contain more than one adult, all of <b>whom</b> <b>do</b> not own a home.|$|E
2500|$|Panta bhat is {{especially}} popular in rural areas. It is usually served as breakfast, though noon or evening consumption is not uncommon. Panta bhat and other low nutrition food are consumed as fillers between meals.

Certainly not the plants, of which we exterminate whole communities without batting an eye. Certainly not the animals, of which we have already extirpated many of the largest and most beautiful species. A land ethic of course cannot prevent the alteration, management, and use of these ‘resources,’ but it does affirm their right to continued existence, and, at least in spots, their continued existence in a natural state. In short, a land ethic changes the role of Homo sapiens from conqueror of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it. It implies respect for his fellow-members, and also respect for the community as such." ...|$|E

Do the math: the other option is more chaotic, given that those expected to fill the vacuum are al-Qaeda and the Salafist organizations. It is better to face a state, because not having a clear address is much worse for us. There are almost 400 gangs operating in Syria, so with <b>whom</b> <b>do</b> you talk and who do you hold accountable?" [...] Minister for International Affairs, Strategy and Intelligence Yuval Steinitz said on 10 June 2013 that [...] "I always thought that it might be the case {{that at the end of}} the day Assad, with a very strong Iranian and Hezbollah backing, might gain the upper hand. And I think that this is possible and I thought that this is possible already a long time ago. [...] might not just survive but even regain territories." [...] The statement was met with a cool reception by the foreign and defense ministries.|$|E
2500|$|A third {{recurring}} {{image is}} that of the lion. This is introduced by Rutland in Act 1, Scene 3; [...] "So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch" [...] (l.174). Later, Richard, speaking of York, says [...] "Methought he bore him in the thickest troop/As doth a lion in a herd of neat" [...] (2.1.13–14). As Clifford chastises Henry for disinheriting Prince Edward, he asks [...] "To <b>whom</b> <b>do</b> lions cast their gentle looks?/Not to the beast that would usurp the den" [...] (2.2.11–12). Lions are then mentioned in conjunction with lambs during the Battle of Tewkesbury; [...] "While lions roar and battle for their dens/Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity" [...] (2.5.74–75). Lions and lambs are again combined when, just before his second capture, Henry is wondering why the people prefer Edward to him; [...] "And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,/The lamb will never cease to follow him" [...] (4.8.49–50). Warwick later combines lions and birds during his death speech, [...] "I must yield my body to the earth/And by my fall, the conquest to my foe./Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,/Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,/Under whose shade the ramping lion slept" [...] (5.2.9–13).|$|E
