5|$|Meanwhile, a raiding party {{attacked}} Williams Station, a Pony Express station {{located on}} the Carson River near present-day Lake Lahontan. One account says the raid <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>deliberate</b> attempt to provoke war. Another says the raiders had heard that men at the station had kidnapped two Paiute women, and fighting broke out {{when they went to}} investigate and free the women. Either way, the war party killed five men and the station was burned.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, the {{automotive}} industry and others were directly responsible for the decline of public transportation. The Great American streetcar scandal saw GM, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California, Phillips Petroleum, Mack Trucks and other companies purchase a number of streetcars and electric trains in the 1930s and 1940s, such that 90percent of city trolleys had been dismantled by 1950. It was argued that this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>deliberate</b> destruction of streetcars {{as part of a}} larger strategy to push the United States into automobile dependency. In United States v. National City Lines, Inc., many were found guilty of antitrust violations. The story has been explored several times in print, film and other media, for example in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Taken for a Ride and The End of Suburbia.|$|E

5|$|On February 9, 2006, Nick Baron {{announced}} that a version of Halo 2 would be released on PC, exclusively for the Windows Vista operating system. While this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>deliberate</b> decision by Microsoft to push sales of Vista, the game could be enabled to play on Windows XP through an unauthorized third-party patch. The game was ported by a small team at Microsoft Game Studios (codenamed Hired Gun) who worked closely with Bungie. As one of the launch titles of Games for Windows – Live, the game offered Live features not available in the Xbox version, such as guide support and achievements. The Windows port also added two exclusive multiplayer maps and a map editor.|$|E
5|$|Restoration {{work was}} carried out in the 1830s by William Craven, the Earl of Craven. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>deliberate</b> attempt at conserving the {{existing}} building, rather than rebuilding it, and was a very unusual approach at this time. By 1845, stone buttresses and pillars had been added to support parts of the hall and its roof. Research by Thomas Turner was published in 1851, outlining the history of the castle. Frances Stackhouse Acton, a local landowner, took a particular interest in the castle, and in 1853 convinced William to carry out further repair work on the castle, under her supervision, at a cost of £103.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union {{initially}} denied {{knowledge of}} the incident, but later admitted shooting down the aircraft, claiming that {{it was on a}} MASINT spy mission. The Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union said it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>deliberate</b> provocation by the United States to probe the Soviet Union's military preparedness, or even to provoke a war. The White House accused the Soviet Union of obstructing search and rescue operations. The Soviet Armed Forces suppressed evidence sought by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) investigation, such as the flight recorders, which were released eight years later, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|The Tribal Hidage {{is a list}} of thirty-five {{tribes that}} was {{compiled}} in Anglo-Saxon England some time between the 7th and 9th centuries. It includes a number of independent kingdoms and other smaller territories and assigns a number of hides to each one. The list of tribes is headed by Mercia and consists almost exclusively of peoples who lived south of the Humber estuary and territories that surrounded the Mercian kingdom, some of which have never been satisfactorily identified by scholars. The value of 100,000 hides for Wessex is by far the largest: {{it has been suggested that}} this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>deliberate</b> exaggeration.|$|E
5|$|The band applied {{microphone}} placement techniques {{similar to}} those which many orchestras used. The recording process <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>deliberate</b> exaggeration of the techniques used by the Beatles in the early 1960s, with a four-track representation of the devices. The guitars can be heard separately on the stereo channels—electric bass on the left channel, rhythm guitar on the right—drums and vocals are mixed {{in the middle of}} the stereo mix. The mixing of the production also used more modern techniques such as overdubbing, a technique used by studios to add a supplementary recorded sound to the material. The band also used a technique known as doubling, where the vocal line used is sung twice.|$|E
5|$|Aesthetically, {{the game}} used Fire Emblem {{elements}} as motifs, but took its setting and premise of {{a clash between}} worlds from Shin Megami Tensei. The battle system was originally going {{to be similar to}} a Fire Emblem game, but while it did incorporate elements such as the Weapon Triangle, it ultimately became a turn-based RPG battle system. After Atlus was made primary developer, the story was set in modern-day Tokyo and written around a group of young people facing challenges together. Its upbeat focus on character drama <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>deliberate</b> shift away from the dark scenarios of the Megami Tensei series. The game takes place in multiple locations around Tokyo, including Shibuya and Harajuku. The modern setting provided challenges for incorporating Fire Emblem characters, as characters in medieval armor just dropping into a modern setting would have looked strange. Among the considered possibilities were introducing Fire Emblem characters as human party members. In the end, it was decided to make them summoned helpers similar to the demons of Shin Megami Tensei, drawn into the real world from their Idolosphere dimension.|$|E

5|$|In Britain, Seymour's {{victory was}} rewarded: Seymour himself was {{presented}} with a commemorative medal, £100 (with £625 to share among the wounded) and the freedoms of Cork and Limerick, although there were suggestions that he should receive a knighthood. In addition, first lieutenant Goddard Blennerhasset was promoted to commander, the junior officers were advanced and Thétis was purchased by the Royal Navy as HMS Brune, the crews of Emerald and Amethyst profiting from the prize money. Four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847. Amethyst had been severely damaged in the engagement and repairs took 71 days to complete at Plymouth. Five months later, Seymour and Maitland were specially selected to hunt the Niémen, en route to Île de France, in the Bay of Biscay. Again, Emerald was absent when the frigate was brought to action and again Seymour was able to capture his opponent after a fierce encounter in the Action of 6 April 1809. Although Seymour praised the bravery of Thétis surviving French officer, Lieutenant Joseph Dedé, Dedé later swore in court that Thétis had not surrendered until after Triumph and Shannon arrived, a statement that contradicts not only British testimony, but also Dedé's own insistence {{on the night of}} the battle that he had not seen any other ships during the action. Historian William James suggests that this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>deliberate</b> attempt to appeal to the French naval authorities to avoid responsibility for the defeat.|$|E

25|$|Creating {{the music}} for the series <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>deliberate</b> attempt to deviate from the {{standard}} for animated cartoons, which traditionally followed the works of Carl Stalling.

Newman's scat singing plays over transitions in the series. The show also incorporated homemade sound effects.|$|E
