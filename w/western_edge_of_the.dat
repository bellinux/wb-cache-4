5|$|Uplift {{from the}} Laramide orogeny and the {{creation}} of the Basin and Range province worked together to steepen the gradient of streams flowing west on the Colorado Plateau. These streams cut deep, eastward-growing, channels into the <b>western</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Colorado Plateau and deposited their sediment in the widening Basin and Range region.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} the city line, I-496 turns southward and merges with US127. The two highways run concurrently, and they cross {{a line of}} the Canadian National Railway. The freeway runs along the <b>western</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> campus of Michigan State University. South of campus, I-496/US127 crosses back into Lansing and has an interchange with Jolly Road before entering Delhi Township. About two-thirds of a mile (1.1km) south of Jolly Road, I-496 meets I-96 and terminates; US127 continues southward as a freeway toward Jackson.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> plateau {{consists}} <b>of</b> numerous broad, gently {{rolling hills}} bisected with deep valleys and steep-walled river canyons. <b>The</b> southern and <b>western</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plateau {{give way to}} broad valleys with soils resulting from glaciation, providing some of Cape Breton's best agricultural lands. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interior and southern <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plateau are covered with damp, cool deciduous forests which makes for spectacular colours during autumn foliage. Southward facing slopes above 300 metres in elevation generally only support Balsam Fir, as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> short growing season and harsh winter climate. <b>The</b> northern and <b>western</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plateau, particularly at high elevations, resemble arctic tundra.|$|R

5|$|St Briavels Castle {{is located}} on a spur {{dominating}} a position above the River Wye, on the <b>western</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Forest of Dean.

5|$|The {{second group}} {{was made up}} of the tribes from eastern Illinois Country, which {{included}} the Miami, Wea, Kickapoo, Mascouten, and Piankashaw. Like the Great Lakes tribes, these people had a long history of close trading and other relations with the French. Throughout the war, the British were unable to project military power into the Illinois Country, which was on the remote <b>western</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conflict. The Illinois tribes were the last {{to come to terms with}} the British.|$|E
5|$|Banksia epica {{is known}} only from two {{population}}s in eastern {{parts of the}} Esperance Plains region of the South West Botanical Province, near the <b>western</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Australian Bight. The main population occurs about 30 kilometres (20mi) west of Point Culver; there were over 2000 plants there when surveyed in June 1989. A smaller population occurs about 70 kilometres (45mi) further east at Toolinna Cove; when surveyed in August 1991, this locality had around 350 plants. This latter population represents the easternmost limit of the western Banksia species; east of Toolinna Cove no Banksia species occurs for over 900 kilometres (550mi).|$|E

5|$|Goat Rocks is an extinct {{stratovolcano}} in the Cascade Range, {{located between}} Mount Rainier and Mount Adams in southern Washington, in the United States. Part of the Cascade Volcanoes, it {{was formed by}} the subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate under the <b>western</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North American Plate. The volcano was active from 3.2 million years ago until eruptions ceased between 1 and 0.5 million years ago. Throughout its complex eruptive history, volcanism shifted from silicic explosive eruptions to voluminous, mafic activity.|$|E
5|$|In Dix, NY414 makes a large reverse S-curve, {{turning to}} the east and {{northeast}} as it follows the Corning Secondary through another creek valley, this one surrounding Shequaga Creek. The creek eventually heads east toward Montour Falls; however, NY414 and the rail line continue northeast to the outskirts of Watkins Glen, a village located inside of a wide valley holding Seneca Lake. At the <b>western</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gully, the Corning Secondary breaks from NY414 to follow the ridge north through Watkins Glen State Park. The route, meanwhile, descends the side of the valley to enter Watkins Glen, where it merges with NY14 {{at the foot of the}} hill.|$|E
5|$|In rural eastern McLeod County, MN7 jogs to {{the north}} around Silver Lake {{in the city of}} the same name. Northeast of Lester Prairie, the highway crosses into Carver County. This area is also rural farm country as the roadway {{bypasses}} New Germany and Mayer {{to the north}}. Near the latter community, MN7 intersects MN25 which provides a connection to both Mayer and the city of Watertown. North of Waconia, the roadway begins to meander southeasterly through an area dotted with several lakes and crosses into the <b>western</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Twin Cities metropolitan area.|$|E
50|$|Along <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state <b>the</b> large rivers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mid-continent erode a {{distance}} {{into the hills}} and it is here, in the west, that some dense pockets of heavy industry appear. In the Kanawha River Valley near Charleston and along the southern Ohio River Valley near Huntington chemicals predominate, attracted by a readily available labor force and access by barge carriers. Metallurgy, especially steel, has been predominant in the Northern Panhandle due to a spill-over effect from <b>the</b> traditional center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US steel industry in Pittsburgh.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{location}} <b>of</b> Fredericktown at <b>the</b> border <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northeastern <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> St. Francois Mountains {{provides a}} sharp contrast in geography as one travels from east to west. <b>The</b> eastern <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> Madison County consists largely of gentler, more rolling hills ridges of sedimentary dolomite, while <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> county consist <b>of</b> steep-sided, round-profile hills consisting largely of far more ancient Precambrian rhyolites and pink granites.|$|R
50|$|The archaic {{city was}} built under a provincially urban {{planning}} and extended {{throughout the whole}} south hill.
