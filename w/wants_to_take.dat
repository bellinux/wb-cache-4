5|$|During the happenings of the episode, a man playing Santa at a Christmas-themed ranch {{is shown}} videotaping the {{children}} at his ranch. Billie later tells Mulder that she saw a vision of her daughter in her room and that she said the number 74. Mulder decides he cannot finish the case and <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> time off because he's too close to make any sound judgment.

5|$|Historically, many {{prospective}} Australian uranium mines {{have been}} constrained by active antinuclear opposition, but state governments have now approved mine development in Western Australia and Queensland. But {{it is unlikely}} that any new projects will enter active development until the market improves. As of 2013 uranium prices are very low. Cameco placed the Kintyre project on hold until market prices improve and Paladin has stated that its project proposals (Bigrlyi, Angela/Pamela, Manyingee, Oobagooma, and Valhalla/Skal) need higher uranium market prices before they can proceed. Toro <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the Wiluna proposal to the development phase, but has not been successful in attracting equity investors. When market prices go up again, so that mine development is justified, most projects would need at least five years to proceed to production.|$|E

5|$|It is {{revealed}} {{later in the}} game that the true villain is Ganon, King of Darkness. He has stolen a powerful trident {{and used it to}} take control of parts of Hyrule. He then stole the dark mirror and used it to create Shadow Link and then sent him to kidnap the shrine maidens and trick Link into releasing Vaati. In order to gain as much power as possible and build up his army, Ganon <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> control of the shrine maidens' power as well as abducting people and sending them into the Dark World where they would become part of his army.

It {{is revealed}} that the Knights of Hyrule were murdered by Ganon and their souls were trapped in the World of Darkness where they became creatures of Darkness. The four Links eventually save the shrine maidens, retrieve the Dark Mirror, destroy Shadow Link and Vaati, and face Ganon in a final battle.

Edmure ridicules Jaime and all of his past misdeeds, and asks him how he can live with himself. Jaime responds how he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Riverrun to be back with Cersei, and he is willing to do anything to achieve it, even if it means killing every Tully he finds, including Edmure and his son. Jaime then sends Edmure to parley with the Blackfish. Despite the Blackfish's protests, the Tully soldiers allow Edmure entry into the castle.

5|$|Due to Tom's illness, Falcon-Price {{takes over}} the {{operation}} of the station and the team must deal with his constant presence and the pressure which they are put under. Falcon-Price's constant attempts to prove that Tom is not up to his job have also grown more intense at Tom's initial sign of weakness. We see that Alex is having trouble dealing with his new role as a father, and, on top of this, Alex is stabbed by a criminal, and this begins to look as if it is all Tom's fault. The two rivals, Kelly and Joss, enter into new romances: Joss with a pickpocket victim and Kelly with a rival lawyer. They must deal with their constant jealousy of each other and their constant drive to outdo each other, as it had been ever since they left the Academy. Joss must also deal with his growing gambling debts and the consequences of these, including his being beaten up, his being forced to get a second job and his becoming homeless. He must also deal with the people around him who, in trying to help him, make him feel worse; particularly the arrival of his mother in town. Dismissed police officer Adam Cooper also arrives back in Mount Thomas, {{for the first time since}} Tom dismissed him in 1998. This time he arrives in Mount Thomas as a photocopier technician and <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> revenge on Tom. In an attempt to do this, he tries to frame him for a crime he did not commit. In the heat of these allegations against Mount Thomas' top cop, there is the very real possibility that the Mount Thomas police station may be closed forever, and the team are forced to find new placements and the possibility of separation from one another.|$|E

Peggy realises that Stacey needs to look after her daughter so she leaves. Ryan confronts Stacey at the hospital, shocked with her confession, refuses to acknowledge his daughter, and goes on his honeymoon with Janine. Peggy goes into the pub and looks around as she remembers events from her time there. She then tells Billy she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Phil away to make a fresh start and to protect him.

25|$|To say the least, a {{fight at}} close range is {{absorbing}} as a spectacle.

To deliberately stand up and turn your back to a battle and hear immediate evidences of the boundless enthusiasm with which a large company of the enemy shoot at you from an adjacent thicket is, to my mind at least, a very great feat. One need not dwell upon the detail of keeping the mind carefully upon a slow spelling of an important code message.|$|E
