25|$|The poem {{allows the}} reader to {{experience}} this, her dying wish, in a very personal and powerful way as she entreats us to come in close and listen to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> say like a loved one and a confidence. Yet the reader is {{struck by the fact}} that even as we read her final request, we know it goes un-honored. This has a further social implication on the silencing of marginalized cultures and, additionally, women.|$|E
500|$|With sarcasm, Caragiale {{proceeds}} {{to indicate that}} the character's main trait is his inventive use of Romanian and his tendency to coin terms and make jokes, with which [...] "First and foremost, our little Parisian astounds the provincials". The remainder of the sketch lists Mitică's remarks, part of which are platitudes or clichés. Some of them are isolated observations, which the author defines as [...] "sentimental, lyrical, and melancholic": [...] "The most beautiful girl can only offer <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> offer", [...] "Life is a dream, death is an awakening", and [...] "Every rose has its thorn".|$|E
500|$|... "Try a Little Tenderness" [...] {{received}} {{a stream of}} bouquets from the critics. Kubicek raved that Mercedes [...] "gave 100% of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> offer, which is pure greatness", and Respers France said she [...] "stole the night" [...] and was [...] "amazing". Berk broke his own {{scale of one to}} five stars with six stars, and praised [...] "the unstinting instrument that is Mercedes' voice". Gonzalez gave it an [...] "A" [...] and called it [...] "pure perfection", but Benigno was more restrained with a [...] "B+", and wrote [...] "she hits a little too hard for my taste" [...] and [...] "the vocals … threaten to engulf the song itself".|$|E

500|$|Aqua's role in Kingdom Hearts 0.2 {{was highly}} praised by Siliconera. The writer enjoyed how the game explores Aqua's {{vulnerability}} {{as well as}} her strength and sacrifice to protect her friends. Additionally, the writer commented that [...] "We see that she's not some perfect heroine capable of accomplishing everything, but rather a strong woman who’s willing to do <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> for the greater good". Chris Carter from Destructoid expressed disappointment with the fact that none of the three protagonists of Birth by Sleep were saved by this game, but still wanted to play as any of them. Kimberly Wallace from Game Informer said Aqua was one of her favorite characters due to [...] "her selflessness and determination to save the world, and getting some resolution to her story was satisfying". She also commented that she expected Aqua to play a bigger role in Kingdom Hearts III.|$|E
500|$|... "Nice Is Different Than Good" [...] {{was written}} by series creator and {{executive}} producer Marc Cherry and directed by Larry Shaw. It marked the debut of Drea de Matteo as Angie Bolen, the matriarch of an Italian family. While brainstorming ideas for the sixth season, the Desperate Housewives writing staff decided to introduce an Italian New Yorker housewife, as she would be unlike the other title characters. When she was offered the role of Angie, de Matteo was {{best known for her}} Emmy Award-winning performance as Adriana La Cerva on The Sopranos, an HBO drama series about the Italian Mafia. She accepted the offer without knowing the character's name or storyline. Cherry described the Angie character as [...] "a very loving but tough Italian woman who comes [...] with her husband and her kid... will do <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> to protect her family." [...] Jeffrey Nordling and Beau Mirchoff made their series debuts in this episode as well, appearing as Nick, Angie's landscaper husband, and Danny, their [...] "tightly-wound" [...] son, respectively. Maiara Walsh also joined the cast as a series regular, having made her debut as Ana Solis in a guest starring capacity during season five.|$|E
500|$|Before the character's debut, de Matteo {{described}} Angie as [...] "brassy" [...] and a [...] "liberal New Yorker," [...] {{which she}} said contrasts with the more conservative nature of the other characters. She commented that Angie [...] "is less of a housewife {{than the rest of}} them. She's a real broad." [...] However, de Matteo also noted that Angie is [...] "not just the brassy smart-talker" [...] and has a vulnerable side, which would be explored in the show. Cherry boosted Angie as [...] "a loving but tough Italian woman... who will do <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> protect her family." [...] He also described her as [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "shielded," [...] which leaves her largely detached from the other women on the series. Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly described the character as [...] "icy." [...] Entertainment Weekly Tanner Stransky wrote that Angie was [...] "very real and very gritty," [...] noting that the character was capable [...] "of doing what they need to survive, no matter what the price." [...] Within the series, Bree Hodge (Marcia Cross) describes Angie as blunt and tactless.|$|E

500|$|The album's {{exploration}} of sexuality was particularly well received by reviewers. The New York Times chief critic Jon Pareles described the tracks as [...] "steamy and sleek, full of erotic exploits and sultry vocals" [...] noting that [...] "every so often, for variety, they turn vulnerable, compassionate or pro-feminist". Caitlin White, writing for The 405, characterized Beyoncé as a feminist text. She {{noted that the}} tracks demonstrate Beyoncé's desire to retain complete sexual agency, while also forgoing the expectations of pop songcraft by placing female pleasure at the forefront unquestioningly. Robert Christgau admired the album's [...] "sex sequence" [...] of songs, where for [...] "over seven well-differentiated tracks", Beyoncé [...] "performs the unlikely feat of conveying an open-ended eroticism that varies because [...] knows eroticism does, {{for each of us}} in our individual responses as well as for her". PopMatters' David Amidon similarly praised the album's honest, highly sexual nature, observing it was [...] "her first attempt at bridging an audience, making music that makes the men want to hear <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> say and the women feel like they can say it to men as well".|$|E
500|$|Naz {{believes}} that her new friends can {{take her away}} from her home life. She {{falls in love with}} Sol, which Hussen said leads to Naz having to make a difficult decision as Sol is [...] "the wrong person". Naz turns out to be not as strong as first expected, and she puts up a wall. Hussen said that there is something about Sol that attracts her, and as she is stronger than he is, she sees it as taking him in and teaching him. Sol falls for Naz very quickly, and Cole said they have never met people like each other before. Naz is a party girl who loves to have fun, but causes trouble and drama, such as when her argument with Fatboy in episode 1 leads to a fight between the [...] and 2. Hussen said that this was her favourite scene to film. Not everyone gets on with Naz straight away. She is confident and fiery, she has a strong power and people listen to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> say. Emer Kenny, who played ZsaZsa Carter in series 1 of EastEnders: E20 {{and was one of the}} writers, introducing the characters in the first episode, said that although Naz was her favourite character to write for, she found it a challenge as she is funny but not a [...] "clown" [...] like Fatboy. Kenny compared Naz to ZsaZsa, saying she is clever but cool, feisty, sassy and able to outwit Fatboy. Kenny also admired the character's costume and makeup, saying she looked perfect and was exactly as she imagined her to look.|$|E
500|$|Davis' film {{career began}} with small {{supporting}} roles in two films that were released in 1949, The Doctor and the Girl with Glenn Ford and East Side, West Side starring Barbara Stanwyck. She played a child psychiatrist {{in the film}} noir Shadow on the Wall (1950) with Ann Sothern and Zachary Scott; her performance was called [...] "beautiful and convincing" [...] by New York Times critic A. H. Weiler. She co-starred in 1950's The Next Voice You Hear..., playing a pregnant housewife who hears the voice of God from her radio. Influential reviewer Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote that [...] "Nancy Davis [...] delightful as [...] gentle, plain, and understanding wife." [...] In 1951, Davis appeared in Night into Morning, her favorite screen role, a study of bereavement starring Ray Milland. Crowther said that Davis [...] "does nicely as the fiancée who is widowed herself and knows the loneliness of grief," [...] while another noted critic, The Washington Posts Richard L. Coe, said Davis [...] "is splendid as the understanding widow." [...] MGM released Davis from her contract in 1952; she sought {{a broader range of}} parts, but also married Reagan, keeping her professional name as Davis, and had her first child that year. She soon starred in the science fiction film Donovan's Brain (1953); Crowther said that Davis, playing the role of a possessed scientist's [...] "sadly baffled wife," [...] "walked through it all in stark confusion" [...] in an [...] "utterly silly" [...] film. In her next-to-last movie, Hellcats of the Navy (1957), she played nurse Lieutenant Helen Blair, and appeared in a film for the only time with her husband, playing what one critic called [...] "a housewife who came along for the ride." [...] Another reviewer, however, stated that Davis plays her part satisfactorily, and [...] "does well with <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> work with." ...|$|E

2500|$|Female {{streamers}} {{are most}} often criticized for purportedly using services like Twitch {{as an alternative to}} soft-core cam websites to solicit donations by performing sexually suggestive acts. Many male gamers, who dominate the industry, correlate female streamers' success to this behavior. Vivyan Andrew, a 29-year-old twitch streamer addresses this in an interview with Kotaku, [...] ""Yes, if you're a woman and you're streaming, the misconceptions are that you're seeking attention and/or trying to use your 'assets' to receive donations. The misconceptions are very superficial as they invalidate the streamer as a person and <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> offer beyond her appearance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine {{said that}} [...] "the gospel-tinged [...] starts out simply with {{measured}} piano and basic drum programming, eventually building to a crescendo of operatic proportions." [...] Steve Jones of USA Today described the song as [...] "a bluesy ode to self-destructive love" [...] and further {{commented that the}} song [...] "is only a teaser for <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> offer." [...] Simon Price of The Independent called the song Keys' breakthrough song and noted how the melody of the song is similar to Queen's [...] "We Are the Champions". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic pointed out the lack of depth in the song, saying it [...] "doesn't have much body to it", which he felt was [...] "a testament to Keys' skills as a musician." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anna Walton as Princess Nuala: King Balor's {{daughter}} and Nuada's twin sister. She {{is described as}} [...] "very light" [...] while Nuada is [...] "very dark", creating a yin and yang dynamic. She elaborated on the incestuous tones between her character and Prince Nuada, [...] "He's the dark side and she's the light side and they're pulled apart and pulled back together again, and she's {{trying to get away}} because she knows there is something she has to do. He can't let that go and they can't really do anything without each other so it's a really interesting thing." [...] Her character also forms a relationship with Abe Sapien, and Walton noted their similarities, [...] "They are both slightly lost souls and they understand each other." [...] Walton spoke of her character's sense of purpose, [...] "She feels very strongly about <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do in the film, and then her absolute connection and love for the Earth and what we are given. That's what she's here to protect... Her relationship with her brother, and how he is almost a part of her but she has to break away and will {{do whatever it takes to}} stop him from achieving what he wants to achieve, which is the mass destruction of mankind." ...|$|E
