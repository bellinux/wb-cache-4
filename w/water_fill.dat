40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} properties of simultaneous <b>water</b> <b>filling</b> for a wireless system with two mutually interfering transmitters and receivers with non-cooperative coding strategies. This is slightly {{different from the}} traditional interference channel problem which assumes that transmitters cooperate in their respective coding strategies, and that interference cancellation can be performed at the receivers. In this non-cooperative setup, greedy capacity optimization by individual transmitters through various algorithms leads to simultaneous <b>water</b> <b>filling</b> fixed points where the spectrum of the transmit covariance matrix of one user <b>water</b> <b>fills</b> over the spectrum of its corresponding interference-plus-noise covariance matrix, and in our paper we study the properties of these fixed points. We show that at a simultaneous <b>water</b> <b>filling</b> point the eigenvectors of transmit covariance matrices at each receiver are aligned, and identify three regimes which correspond to simultaneous <b>water</b> <b>filling</b> that depend on the interference gains: a) complete spectral overlap, b) partial spectral overlap, and c) spectral segregation. These imply that the transmit covariance matrices will be white in regions of both overlap and segregation, but not necessarily white overall. We also consider performance {{as a function of}} interference gain and show that complete spectral overlap is a strongly suboptimal solution over a wide range of gains. Overall...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of various renal pelvic pressure gradients on nephrons with purulent infection. Five miniature test pigs were selected. One side of the kidney was used to prepare the pyonephrosis model and the other side was used as the healthy control. A piezometer and a <b>water</b> <b>fill</b> tube were inserted into the renal pelvis through the ureter. Prior to perfusion, punctures were made on the healthy and purulent sides of the kidneys to obtain tissues (as controls). Subsequently, a puncture biopsy was conducted on the kidneys at five pressure levels: 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mmHg. Once the renal pelvic pressure had increased, the healthy and injured kidneys presented pathological changes, including dilation of the renal tubule and capsule and compression of the renal glomerulus. When the renal pelvic pressure exceeded 20 mmHg, the injured kidney presented more damage. Electron microscopy revealed that the increase in pressure resulted in the following: the podocyte gap widened, the epithelial cells of the renal capsule separated from the basement membrane, the basement membrane thickness became uneven, the continuity of the basement membrane was interrupted at multiple posi-tions and the renal tubule microvillus arrangement became disorganised. The manifestations in the pyonephrosis model were more distinct compared with those in the healthy kidney. As the renal pelvic pressure exceeds 20 mmHg under a renal purulent infection status, the nephrons become damaged. The extent of the damage is aggravated as the pressure is increased...|$|E
