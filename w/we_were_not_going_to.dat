500|$|In April 2010, Sutherland {{said in an}} {{interview}} at a BAFTA event in London that the script was finished and he would be reading it upon his return to the United States. He also said that the film will be a two-hour representation of a twenty-four-hour time frame. Sutherland described the film production as [...] "exciting" [...] because, [...] "It's going to be a two-hour representation of a 24 hour day, so <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be restrained by the real time aspect of the TV show." ...|$|E
2500|$|U.S. General Gallagher in Hanoi {{reported}} a [...] "noticeable {{change in the}} attitude of the Annamites [...] here...since that became {{aware of the fact that}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> interfere and would probably help the French.|$|E
2500|$|After being {{informed}} by intercom that a hijacking was in progress, Captain Uri Bar Lev {{decided not to}} accede to their demands:"I decided that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be hijacked. The security guy was sitting here ready to jump. I told him that I {{was going to put}} the plane into negative-G mode. Everyone would fall. When you put the plane into negative, it's like being in a falling elevator. Instead of the plane flying this way, it dives and everyone who is standing falls down." ...|$|E

The rules of asylum in principle forbid meddling {{in the politics of}} the country that grants asylum. But as a matter of courtesy <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to bar Julian Assange from exercising his right to be a candidate. Just so long as he doesn't make fun of Australian politicians or people." ...|$|R

2500|$|Jim Sullivan, {{the local}} Official IRA commander, {{feared that the}} troops would launch a bigger raid and {{instructed}} his men to move weapons out of the area. At about 6pm, Provisional IRA volunteers attacked the troops with improvised hand grenades. A number of soldiers suffered leg injuries. As more troops arrived, [...] "the Officials realized {{that they would have}} to fight" [...] and Sullivan ordered his men to confront the troops. An Official IRA source later said, [...] "The way we looked at it, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> put up our hands and let them take the weaponry. We didn't want the confrontation, but we couldn't surrender". One source said that 60–70 Official IRA volunteers were involved, while another said 80–90. Each was armed with a rifle and at least one revolver. They exchanged fire with the troops and attacked them with grenades. Hundreds of local youths also pelted the troops with stones and petrol bombs. Journalist Simon Winchester later wrote:To anyone who experienced the battle, it was perfectly obvious that hundreds and hundreds of bullets were being fired by both sides – and yet the Army had the gall, when asked by reporters later in the weekend, to say that its soldiers fired only 15 shots in sum. The official figures were to be published later: soldiers in the Falls that weekend fired no less than 1,457 rounds.|$|E

5000|$|Chiluba's {{personal}} appearance and dapper dress {{as well as}} his short stature (Chiluba stood just 1.5 m (5 ft) tall) was taken notice of both by his supporters and opponents throughout his career. In connection to European corruption allegations against him in the late 2000s, it was revealed that a Swiss shop had produced over 100 pairs of size 6 shoes for him with two inch heels, many monogrammed. [...] His careful appearance and taste for fine suits became a trademark, and was noted during his corruption trial. In a particularly harsh example, Zambian Post writer Roy Clarke ran a recurring column which lampooned the President during his time in office as [...] "a vain, cross-dressing, high-heel wearing, adulterous, dwarf thief". [...] Political opponents make reference to these charges and traits in their criticisms of Chiluba's rule. Candidate Michael Sata, for instance, has played on this popular stereotype of Chiluba, charging that [...] "Chiluba's thinking is as tall as he <b>is...</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to steal money, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to plunder, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to buy suits, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to buy shoes. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to give girls houses..." [...] President Kaunda famously referred to Chiluba as the [...] "Four-foot Dwarf" [...] during Chiluba's rise in opposition politics. Chiluba was acquitted of all corruption charges in August 2009. [...] Mr Chiluba had also been described by the BBC as [...] "a fervent born-again Christian..." [...] whose [...] "...private life was the subject of much gossip." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{he found}} out that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>NOT</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Mazatlan, and this was his only chance; it must have {{happened}} just as the ship went about and stood off from shore again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed I did. She would come. It was {{her first}} act of rebellion; for <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let you meet the frosts alone--the October frosts, I mean; I hope the Dynevor Frosts are all right?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Think of our bride's brother amusing {{himself in}} such a place as that with cooking drugs in saucepans," [...] muttered Monsieur Justin, peeping into the room. [...] "I am the least {{particular}} man in the universe, but I must say I wish <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be connected by marriage with an amateur apothecary. Pah!

60|$|On {{the point}} of starting, Captain Bob's men raised the most {{outrageous}} cries, and tried to prevent us. Though hitherto we had strolled about wherever we pleased, this grand conjunction of our whole force, upon one particular expedition, seemed to alarm them. But we assured them that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> assault the village; and so, after {{a good deal of}} gibberish, they permitted us to leave.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure, and didn't {{you agree}} with me, Carrie," [...] her husband said, in an aggrieved voice, [...] "that as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make the boy a parson, and as {{it was too much}} to expect him to learn Spanish, and a score of other things, at once; that we ought to get someone who would make his lessons {{pleasant}} for him, and not be worrying his soul out of his body with all sorts of useless balderdash?" ...|$|E
60|$|Esmeer's {{idea came}} with {{an effect of}} real {{emancipation}} to several of us. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be afraid of ideas any longer, {{we were going to}} throw down every barrier of prohibition and take them in and see what came of it. We became for a time even intemperately experimental, and one of us, at the bare suggestion of an eminent psychic investigator, took hashish and very nearly died of it within a fortnight of our great elucidation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of no consequence, I assure you. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> {{hard on a}} {{lady who}} {{did not belong to}} the Women's Press Association. Take a harp." ...|$|R

60|$|The {{moment the}} stairs were put down, we scuffled ashore, {{and left the}} steamer {{to go on to}} the Bahamas {{whenever}} she felt like it. We gave our valises and trunk-checks to a negro man with a wagon, and told him to take the baggage to a hotel that we could see from the wharf, and then we started off for the fort. But on my way along the wharf I made up my mind that, as the fort had been there for three hundred years, it would probably stand a while longer, and that we had better go along with our baggage, and see about getting a place to live in, for <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be in any hurry to leave St. Augustine.|$|E
60|$|And sure enough, {{the moment}} her bows passed beyond the pier, the sea struck her, and tossed her like an eggshell, and the deck, from stem to stern, was drenched in a moment, and running with floods {{as if she}} had been under water. For a few moments H. and I both enjoyed the motion. We stood amidships, she in her shawl, I in a great {{tarpauling}} which I had borrowed of Jack, and every pitch sent the spray over us. We exulted that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be sick. Suddenly, however, so suddenly that it was quite mysterious, conscience smote me. A profound, a deep-seated remorse developed itself just exactly in the deepest centre of the pit of my stomach.|$|E
6000|$|... "That makes a difference," [...] he went on, with a sad smile. [...] "You see, we {{soldiers}} all had feelings. And in {{one thing}} we all felt alike. That was {{we were going to}} fight for our homes and our women. I should say women first. No matter what we read or heard about standing by our allies, fighting for liberty or civilization, the truth was we all felt the same, even if we never breathed it.... Glenn fought for you. I fought for Nell.... <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let the Huns treat you as they treated French and Belgian girls.... And think! Nell was engaged to me--she loved me--and, by God! She married a slacker when I lay half dead on the battlefield!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank {{you very}} much," [...] she said. [...] "It is all rather in the air, at present, you know. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> married for some time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> {{into the}} theater," [...] {{answered}} May stiffly. She {{did not like}} either Slugger or Nappy, and was sorry the pair had shown themselves.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{if he is}} there, you bet <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to {{run away}} from him!" [...] {{declared}} Phil. [...] "Come on, let's see if we can't shoot him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{were too}} much {{surprised}} to offer much resistance. Five fellows, {{who said they}} were the committee appointed by the Junta, came to us and told us that unless we dispersed at once we should be severely punished. We told them that we had come out of our homes at the orders of the Junta, but that as the Junta had not supplied us with arms we had come for them, as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fight the French with nothing but sticks. They then threatened us again, and we told them that if they hindered us from defending the country we should hang them at once; and as they saw we meant it, they went quietly off to their houses. Then we broke down the door of the magazine. We found four thousand muskets there. Each man took one, and we left the remainder and enough ammunition for them, and have brought the rest here, together with a hundred spare muskets.|$|E
60|$|The {{signs of}} travel {{had not only}} ceased, but a little {{in front of us}} the way was barred by a gate, and beyond this gate there was nothing but a sort of savage pasture, with many red and brown cattle in it, {{gathered}} questioningly about the barrier, or lifting their heads indifferently from the grass. Just before we reached the gate we passed a peasant's cottage, where he was sociably getting in his winter's coal, and he and his wife and children, and the carter, all leaned upon whatever supports they found next them, and stared at the extraordinary apparition of two, I hope, personable strangers driving in a hansom of extreme type into a cow pasture. But <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> give ourselves away to their too probable ignorance by asking if that were the place where the Pilgrims who founded New England were first stopped from going to Holland.|$|E
6000|$|The {{disadvantage}} of an opening {{like this is}} that it holds the same quality, if not quantity, of disappointment as those other sublime things, and we earnestly entreat the reader to guard himself against expecting anything considerable from it. Probably the inexperienced reader has imagined from our weighty prologue something of signal importance to follow; but the reader who has been our reader through thick and thin for many years will have known from the first that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> deal with anything more vital, say, than a few emotions and memories, prompted, one night of the other winter, by hearing one of the old-fashioned Italian operas which a more than commonly inspired management had been purveying to an over-Wagnered public. In fact, we had a sense that this sort of reader was there with us the night we saw [...] "L'Elisir d'Amore," [...] and that it was in his personality we felt and remembered many things which we could have fancied personal only to ourselves.|$|E
