40|$|The {{considerable}} {{volume of}} chromium-bearing wastes generated {{during the process}} of leather tanning, exacerbated by the potential for trivalent chromium in the wastes to be oxidised to the toxic hexavalent state, has created a major waste disposal dilemma for the tanning industry. While methods are available for the safe and effective treatment of residual chrome-tanning liquors, little has been done {{to address the issue of}} the chrome-bearing solid wastes. Given the increasingly stringent environmental compliance standards facing tanneries, unless an appropriate treatment process is developed in the immediate future, the continued use of chromium as a tanning agent could be compromised. Recent investigations have demonstrated the potential of heated alkaline conditions for dechroming these solid wastes. This study expanded upon these considerations and examined the feasibility of utilising the highly alkaline tannery waste effluents as cost-effective, substitute alkaline media. The three effluents considered in this study, classed as lime <b>sulphide</b> <b>liquors,</b> were shown to be capable of dechroming wet blue shavings, with resultant separation of the solid wastes into a protein and a concentrated chromium product. The solubilised protein product contained low chromium concentrations which comply with legal discharge limits. The precipitated chromium product offers opportunity for reutilisation in the tannery. A novel industrial-scale treatment process, based on these investigations, indicated the process to be capable of treating the quantity of shavings produced on a daily basis by a medium to large scale tannery. Application of this method for the dechroming of other chrome-tanned solid wastes was also shown to be feasible. ...|$|R

PTEs and pH display a positive correlation confirming that heavy metal mobility is directly related to pH and, therefore, affects their availability. The estimated contamination factor classified 92. 6 % of soil samples as moderately to ultra-highly polluted. The spatial distribution of the potential ecological risk index classified the topsoil as being of a very high ecological risk, consistent with wind direction.

Samples from mine-waste piles, pyrite mud tailings and river sediments were continuously exposed to the atmosphere during the summer, and spectral measurements were collected in the dark room on several days. The spectral response was monitored throughout the summer, when the pyrite oxidation process is active and the mineralogy on the surface changes continuously. The mineralogical identification capability of algorithms such as the Spectral Angle Mapper, Binary Encoding and Spectral Feature Fitting based on archive spectral libraries is discussed. Trends of mineral growth differ spectrally over time according to the geological setting.

40|$|ABSTRACT: One of {{the most}} serious {{environmental}} issues related to the mining industry in Canada and elsewhere, is the pollution from abandoned mine waste disposal sites. The <b>wastes</b> containing <b>sulphide</b> minerals can oxidize and generate contaminants in the water drainage, a phenomenon called acid mine drainage (AMD). Different techniques are available to control the production of AMD. However, these techniques were mainly developed for the closure of operating sites, and are not as efficient for abandoned mine sites that were left exposed to natural conditions for years. The main differences between an operating and abandoned mine waste disposal site are the quality of the interstitial water, the presence of well implemented acidophilic bacteria, {{and the quality of the}} retaining infrastructures. To avoid contamination of surrounding ecosystems, it is necessary to take into consideration these particularities at the reclamation stage. The experience at the Lorraine mine site shows a slight improvement of the water quality in the waste disposal site 10 years after reclamation even if the oxygen barrier is working as expected. The addition of a passive treatment system to treat the contaminated pore water that will eventually flow out of the site is then a critical component of the reclamation at any abandoned AMD mine waste disposal site...|$|R

This is because the pure copper ore reserves are becoming exhausted and the resources of unexploited ores often contain relatively high amounts of antimony and arsenic. During smelting of copper concentrates, arsenic is easily removed into the offgas while antimony is not readily removed due to its lower partial pressure and high affinity for liquid copper. It is however imperative to selectively eliminate and recover the antimony impurity of the copper concentrates in an environmentally friendly process with a view of upgrading the concentrates for pyrometallurgical processing.

40|$|Polyminerallic, sulphidic mine wastes {{were treated}} with KH 2 PO 4 -H 2 O 2 {{solutions}} {{to determine whether the}} formation of solid phosphate coatings inhibits sulphide oxidation and metal and metalloid mobility. The waste rocks were metal (PbZnCu) and metalloid (AsSb) rich and consisted of major quartz, dickite, illite and sulphide minerals (e. g. galena, chalcopyrite, tetrahedrite, sphalerite, pyrite, arsenopyrite) as well as minor to trace amounts of pre- and post-mining oxidation products (e. g. oxides, hydroxides, arsenates and sulphates). Scanning electron microscopy observations of the waste material treated with KH 2 PO 4 -H 2 O 2 solutions showed that metal, metal-alkali and alkali phosphate precipitates formed and coatings developed on all sulphides (with the exception of tetrahedrite). The abundance of phosphate phases was dependant on the availability of metal and alkali cations in solution. In turn, the release of cations was dependent on the amount of sulphide oxidation induced during the experiment or the presence of soluble oxidation products. Lead and to a lesser degree Cu and Zn phosphate coatings remained stable during H 2 O 2 leaching, preventing acid generation and metal release. In contrast, the lack of phosphate coating on tetrahedrite and arsenopyrite allowed oxidation and leaching of As and Sb to proceed and mobilized As and Sb did not form phosphate phases. As a result, As and Sb displayed the greatest release from the coated waste. Thus, the application of KH 2 PO 4 -H 2 O 2 solutions to partly oxidized, polyminerallic mine <b>wastes</b> suppresses <b>sulphide</b> oxidation and is most effective in inhibiting Pb (Cu and Zn) release.

40|$|Acid rock {{drainage}} (ARD) from <b>sulphide</b> bearing <b>waste</b> rock dumps poses {{a serious}} threat to the environment and has become problematic to the mining industry. Water that is discharged from <b>sulphide</b> <b>waste</b> rock dumps {{has the potential to be}} low in pH, thus having the ability to transport heavy metals. The acid water and the heavy metals in solution became toxic to the environment. Acid rock drainage from <b>sulphide</b> bearing <b>waste</b> rock dumps is the most serious environmental liability in the mining industry; believed to be $ 3. 2 billion for 750 million tonnes of waste rock in Canada alone (Feasby et al., 1997). The understanding of the characteristics and quantity of water flow through waste rock has become fundamental. A complete hydrologic characterization was performed for the <b>sulphide</b> <b>waste</b> rock dump at Equity Silver Mine Ltd. near Houston, Be (575 km north northwest of Vancouver, Canada). The characterization of the hydrologic system entailed the investigation of five elements: geologic structure, topography, surface hydrology, groundwater and water chemistry. The hydrologic budget was determined for the waste rock dump. The components are as follows: precipitation, runoff, sublimation, mass transfer, evapotranspiration, changes in storage, infiltration and groundwater. Precipitation was measured with an on site weather station. The runoff was measured for the 1998 freshet with a series of weirs and culverts that were instrumented to measure runoffwater. The remaining surface components were determined by the SoilCover (1997) model, a one dimensional finite difference heat and mass transfer program. The groundwater component was investigated using a numerical model, FEMW A TER (ECGL, 1998), which can solve three dimensional saturated or unsaturated groundwater flow regime systems. All of the surface hydrological components are required in order to equalize the surface water balance for the waste rock dump. The components of the surface hydrological budget during the one year study period over the area of the waste rock dump are as follows: precipitation of 642 mm, 94 rnm (15 %) runoff, 327 mm (51 %) evapotranspiration, 27 rnm (4 %) infiltration, 97 mm (15 %) sublimation and 97 rnm (15 %) mass transfer. The cover system lost 9 rnm of water during the one year study period; thus the net surface infiltration was 36 rnm (6 %). The water balance relationship for the acid rock drainage collection ditch that surrounds the waste rock dump was evaluated. The contributions to the ditch are: runoff, infiltration, groundwater discharge and changes in storage. The water balance for the drainage ditch showed that the acid rock drainage flow reporting to the ditch is equivalent to 318 rnm of water per year over the area of the waste rock dump. The components of this total flow are estimated to be 36 mm (11 %) infiltration, 27 mm (9 %) runoff, 252 mm (79 %) groundwater discharge and 3 mm (1 %) due to changes in storage within the waste rock...|$|R

The life expectancy of organic covers can be predicted by establishing their potential to prevent influx of air into the underlying reactive sulphide mass. Influx of air can be calculated by recording O- 2 concentration in pore air, which is directly related to the moisture content (m) within rite organic material, The moisture content, in each area under study, depends mainly on rainfall rate (w) and on organic material width (h). By correlating these two parameters, provided that the initial moisture content is known, the moisture content within the organic mass, as well as its monthly variations, can be accurately predicted over long periods of time. The methodology used for the prediction of the life expectancy was based on the study of the relationships, which are considered as critical for the effective operation of an organic cover, namely (a) monthly moisture content change vs, monthly rainfall rate and width of the organic cover and (b) O- 2 concentration vs. moisture content. Finally, two case studies examining the application of organic covers over reactive sulphide materials are presented and discussed. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

The main advantages over other types of covers are related with their low hydraulic permeability, high cation exchange capacity and high alkalinity. In addition, the establishment of organic covers, which is considered as a low cost solution for the prevention of acid mine drainage generation, does not disturb the natural environment, since they consist of industrial wastes rather than natural materials and allow the development of vegetation which improves the aesthetics of the reclaimed areas. However, treatment of municipal sewage sludge is necessary prior to discharge, in order to minimize potential health and environmental risks, resulting from the presence of toxic elements. In the present paper all processes associated with the function of an an organic cover are described and discussed, including potential health and environmental risks resulting from land application of municipal sewage sludge. In addition, preliminary laboratory data derived from the application of organic coves over reactive sulphidic concentrates are presented and discussed, in order to evaluate the performance of the covers and to determine the critical factors affecting their performance.

The pronounced contamination of local and regional soils and sediments, despite the relatively small scale of the former operation, is due to the high metal tenor of abandoned waste material and the scarcity of neutralising minerals.

As a result of pyrite oxidation, the creek water displays low pH (down to 2. 5) {{and high levels of}} sulphate (about 40 mmol/L), Fe (12 - 25 mmol/L), and As (1 - 3. 5 mmol/L). The water chemistry, which has been monitored monthly for 4 years, varies seasonally. At the spring of the Reigous Creek, iron (mainly Fe(II)), exhibits concentrations decreasing from 25 mmol/L in summer to 12 mmol/L after rain events. Arsenic varies from 3. 5 to 1 mmol/L and is mainly (50 to 95 %) in the reduced form, As(III). Natural attenuation of As concentrations occurs as a result of microbiologically mediated As-Fe coprecipitation. From 10 to 47 % of the Fe and 17 to 46 % of the As are removed from the aqueous phase within the first 30 m of the stream. The efficiency of this attenuation varies seasonally. The solid that precipitates in the stream has a mean As/Fe ratio of 0. 15 with seasonal variations. Suspended sediments consist of an As-rich amorphous phase of schwertmannite; most laminated concretions contain tooeleite. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that As-rich schwertmannite is formed during rapid Fe oxidation while a slow oxidation rate rather favours the formation of tooeleite. Short-term variation (24 h) of As and Fe concentrations were evidenced in Reigous Creek due to photoreduction of iron-bearing phases, which results in fluctuations of about 10 % in Fe and As concentrations over a 24 h-period...|$|R

Indeed, composting odours have stopped the operation of many platforms and prevented the installation of others. Accordingly, present technologies collecting and treating gases emitted from composting are not satisfactory and alternative solutions must be found. Thus, {{the aim of this}} paper was to study the influence of composting process conditions on gaseous emissions. Pig slaughterhouse sludge mixed with wood chips was composted under forcedaerationin 300 L laboratory reactors. The process conditions studied were: aeration rate of 1. 68, 4. 03, 6. 22, 9. 80 and 13. 44 L/h/kg of wet sludge; incorporation ratio of 0. 55, 0. 83 and 1. 1 (kg of wet wood chips/kg of wet sludge), and; bulking agent particles size of < 10, 10 < 20 and 20 < 30 mm. Out-going gases were sampled every 2 days and their composition was analysed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Fifty-nine compounds were identified and quantified. Dividing the cumulated mass production over 30 days of composting, by odour threshold, 9 compounds were identified as main potential odour contributors: hydrogen sulphide, trimethylamine, ammonia, 2 -pentanone, 1 -propanol- 2 -methyl, dimethyl sulphide, dimethyl disulphide, dimethyl trisulphide and acetophenone. Five gaseous compounds were correlated with both aeration rate and bulking agent to <b>waste</b> ratio: hydrogen <b>sulphide,</b> trimethylamine, ammonia, 2 -pentanone and 1 -propanol- 2 -methyl. However, dropping the aeration rate and increasing the bulking agent to waste ratio reduced gaseous odour emissions by a factor of 5 - 10, when the required threshold dilution factor ranged from 10 (5) to 10 (6), to avoid nuisance at peak emission rates. Process influence on emissions of dimethyl sulphide, dimethyl disulphide, dimethyl trisulphide were poorly correlated with both aeration rate and bulking agent to waste ratio as a reaction with hydrogen sulphide was suspected. Acetophenone emissions originated from the wood chips. Olfactory measurements need to be correlated to gaseous emissions for a more accurate odour emission evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Large {{quantities}} of sulphide-bearing mining wastes produced from ore processing are deposited throughout the world. Sulphide oxidation in the wastes may release acidic water with {{high concentrations of}} metals to the environment. Remediation strategies are usually site specific, since the {{physical and chemical properties}} of the <b>wastes</b> vary. Therefore, <b>sulphide</b> oxidation, oxygen diffusion and metal mobility in unoxidised and oxidised, remediated and unremediated wastes have been studied in the present work. The efficiency of different cover systems on unoxidised tailings from Kristineberg, were studied in pilot-scale test cells (5 * 5 * 3 m 3) under field conditions. Clayey till, sewage sludge, apatite and Trisoplast were used as sealing layers and unspecified till as a protective cover. In one cell tailings were left uncovered. Unoxidised tailings in the test-cells in the initial stage after deposition showed relatively low sulphur release (600 - 800 mg/l) in leachate waters, which probably was an effect of high moisture content in the tailings prior to deposition. Near-neutral pH found in the leachates was an effect of neutralisation by carbonate minerals present and lime (Ca(OH) 2) added prior to deposition. Similar sulphur concentrations were found also in the uncovered tailings. The sulphide oxidation rate increased with time in the uncovered tailings, and decreased in the covered. The lowest oxygen concentrations were observed below the cover system with sewage sludge, which was the most effective barriar against oxygen in a short-term perspective. The oxygen fluxes through the clayey till and apatite layers were within the same magnitude and varied between 0. 5 and 4 mole/year,m 2. The Trisoplast layer seemed to have failed as a barrier against oxygen. Tailings studied at field scale at Laver and Kristineberg had oxidised for more than 50 years. The tailings at Kristineberg have high pyrite content (c. 25 % and 50 %) and those at Laver have low grade of pyrrhotite (2 - 3 %). The Laver tailings are unremediated, while at Kristineberg the tailings were remediated in 1996. The transport of metals in the drainage water at Laver decreased during a study period of 8 years. The transport of dissolved sulphur indicated a declining trend of sulphide oxidation rate in the tailings, which was confirmed by oxygen measurements in the tailings and weathering rate estimations. The decline was considered to be natural {{as a result of the}} increased distance that oxygen has to travel to reach unoxidised sulphide grains. The major part of the amounts of metals released by sulphide oxidation were secondarily retained in the tailings, and to a small extent in layers cemented by jarosite and Fe-(oxy) hydroxides. Sequential extraction of these layers showed that metals such as Cu and Pb were mostly associated with crystalline Fe-(oxy) hydroxides. Most important retention mechanism was, however, sorption onto minerals surfaces below the oxidation front. The studied Impoundment 1 at Kristineberg was remediated by two different methods; on one part a dry cover consisting of a sealing layer and a protective cover were applied, and the groundwater table was raised and a single dry cover applied on the other part. When the groundwater table was raised in oxidised tailings, secondarily retained metals such as Fe, Mg, Mn, S and Zn were remobilised resulting in increased concentrations in the groundwater. The concentrations declined with time, due to dilution by inflowing uncontaminated water. Decreased concentrations of Fe, Mg, Mn, S and Zn were observed also in the groundwater below the dry cover as the amount of percolating water decreased. The concentrations of trace elements such as Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb were almost depleted in the groundwater, since these metals were retained within the tailings by mechanisms such as co-precipitation, precipitation and sorption. Analysis of pyrite grains by LA-ICP-SMS showed that pyrite surfaces were important for retention of As and Cu, in particular, but also for Cd and Zn. This study shows that the physico-chemical conditions expressed by pH and redox potential have a large impact on element mobility’s. For example, As was mobilised as a result of remediation, while the concentrations of most metals decreased in the drainage waters. Godkänd; 2006; 20061116 (pafi...|$|R
40|$|Today, one of {{the major}} {{difficulties}} confronted during copper metallurgy is the elimination of antimony and arsenic impurities from the process. This is because the pure copper ore reserves are becoming exhausted and the resources of unexploited ores often contain relatively high amounts of antimony and arsenic. During smelting of copper concentrates, arsenic is easily removed into the offgas while antimony is not readily removed due to its lower partial pressure and high affinity for liquid copper. Therefore, removal of these impurities at an early stage of processing will be beneficial for the copper making process. The present research is aimed at (i) purifying impure complex copper sulphide concentrates by selectively dissolving the impurities, and consequently, upgrading the concentrates for pyrometallurgical processing, and (ii) depositing antimony as a marketable product from synthetic alkaline <b>sulphide</b> pregnant leach <b>liquors</b> by electrowinning. The mineralogical investigations conducted on the concentrates studied revealed that tetrahedrite, chalcopyrite, galena, sphalerite and pyrite were the common mineralogical phases present in the concentrates. Silver and arsenic were found as solid solution in the tetrahedrite crystal structure. Alkaline sulphide solution was used to dissolve antimony from the concentrates. Antimony recovery from tetrahedrite dissolution was increased by approximately 280 % when the reaction temperature was increased from 84 ⁰C to 105 ⁰C. By raising the concentration of Na 2 S from 60 g/L to 100 g/L, the extraction of Sb was raised by a factor of 3 while increase in NaOH concentration from 30 g/L to 60 g/L enhanced the recovery by 140 %. It was found that the leaching yield decreased by about 37 % when the mineral particle size of the concentrate was increased from - 53 + 38 µm to - 106 + 75 µm. Under the selected leaching conditions, the estimated activation energy of tetrahedrite dissolution in the leaching reagent was 81 kJ/mol, which is indicative of a chemically controlled leach process. Characterisation of the leach residue by XRD and QEMSCAN proves that the alkaline sulphide lixiviant is selective and effective to dissolve the antimony and arsenic from the complex concentrate. The average crystal chemical formulae of the solid residue determined by QEMSCAN indicate the conversion of tetrahedrite into a new copper sulphide having stoichiometry of Cu 1. 64 S. Tetrahedrite in the concentrate was reduced from 30. 2 % to 1. 1 % in the purified leach residue. Moreover, the results of electrowinning tests showed that the initial Na 2 S concentration had a significant influence on Sb deposition from this specific system. Current efficiency decreased remarkably when Na 2 S concentration was increased to 150 g/L. The test results indicated that the desired Na 2 S concentration should be less than 100 g/L. Faraday efficiency increased with increase in current density provided that the residual Sb concentration in the electrolyte remained above 20 g/L. Increase in NaOH concentration from 100 to 400 g/L raised the current efficiency by a factor of almost 1. 5 while the specific energy requirement was reduced from 2. 3 to 1. 9 kWh/kg. Experimental results demonstrated that the specific energy decreased by almost 38 % as the electrolyte temperature increased from 45 to 90 ⁰C and the optimum temperature should be between 50 and 75 ⁰C to reduce the heating cost. It was noted that polysulphide and thiosulphate had an adverse effect on Sb deposition. Current efficiency of the process decreased sharply from 83 % to 32 % when the polysulphide concentration was increased from 0 to 30 g/L; and at this polysulphide concentration, the specific energy was raised from 1. 7 to 4. 9 kWh/kg. Sparging of the electrolyte facilitates a smooth and adherent antimony deposit with an improved purity. The results from these experiments demonstrated that the anodic reactions were influenced by anodic current density and NaOH concentration. The molar concentration ratio between hydroxide and free sulphide ions must be ≥ 7. 3 to produce appreciable amounts of sulphate in the electrolytic process. The amount of sulphate formed increased from 0. 5 to 16. 9 g/L when the anodic current density was increased from 500 to 2500 A/m 2. By raising NaOH concentration from 100 to 400 g/L, the production of sulphate at the anode was enhanced by 6. 2 g/L increment. However, the concentration of thiosulphate formed during the electrolysis decreased with increasing anode current density and NaOH concentration. The main factors influencing the purity of the antimony deposits were current density and NaOH concentration. Antimony purity was lowered from 99. 9 % to 99. 2 % when the current density was increased from 50 to 250 A/m 2. Sparging of the electrolyte during the electrodeposition enhanced antimony purity by 0. 4 %. Finally, a simplified integrated hydro-/electro-metallurgical process flowsheet for antimony removal and recovery from Rockliden sulphide copper concentrate was developed. The experimental results from this investigation confirmed that different concentrations of Na 2 S and NaOH were needed at leaching and electrowinning stages to achieve an efficient process.  Godkänd; 2013; 20130415 (samawe); Tillkännagivande disputation 2013 - 06 - 18 Nedanstående person kommer att disputera för avläggande av teknologie doktorsexamen.

40|$|The {{industry}} of mining and metal production {{has always been}} in conflict with environmental issues. A problem of major concern is the contamination of freshwater around sulphide-bearing mine waste deposits. In northern Sweden many mine <b>wastes</b> originate from <b>sulphide</b> ores and thus generate acid drainage (AMD). The object of this study, Rävlidmyran pit lake, is an abandoned sulphide mine {{owned and operated by}} Boliden Mineral AB between 1951 and 1991. The aim {{of this study is to}} getter a better understanding of the aquatic system at Rävlidmyran. This is done by calculating a metal balance for the pit lake, determining the trace metal transport into the recipient Lake Hornträsket and reviewing how the water quality changes in the surface streams draining the area. Rävlidmyran pit lake is a meromictic flow-through water body with no surface inlets or outlets. Downstream of the pit lake, a waste rock dump acts as an embankment. The pit lake partially drains via seepage through the embankment and the outflowing water shows the characteristics of acid mine drainage (i. e. low pH and high levels of trace metals). Field data (pH, conductivity and temperature) were sampled at Rävlidmyran on a weekly basis from four groundwater pipes, five surface stream stations and from the surface water of the pit lake. Water samples were analyzed for total concentrations of Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb and Zn once a month. Additional sampling was performed for this thesis in September and October 2010, when field data was measured at six locations downstream of the pit lake and a profile was measured in the water column of the pit lake (at the deepest point). The metal balance is calculated assuming steady state regarding the pit lake water balance. Inflowing fluxes of water used in the mass balance are: deep groundwater, shallow groundwater and precipitation. Outflowing fluxes are: groundwater and seepage through the embankment. Metal concentrations for the inflowing and outflowing water fluxes are mainly taken from the sampling data provided by Boliden Mineral AB. For the inflowing deep groundwater no data exist, so concentrations have been estimated from the bottom water of the pit lake. The mass balance is calculated per month for a period of one year between November 2009 and October 2010. Data does not exist for the full year, so two cases of the metal mass balance have been calculated, one with estimated maximum concentrations and one with estimated minimum concentrations. The metal transport to Lake Hornträsket is calculated by multiplying concentration data with measured water flow in the two surface streams draining the mine site. Results from the mass balance suggest that the pit lake continuously accumulates As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, Pb and Zn. For Mn and Ni there appears to be a net export from the pit lake. The largest uncertainties in the mass balance calculations are the metal concentrations for the inflowing deep groundwater. The importance of this parameter was judged by calculating a hypothetical deep groundwater concentration corresponding to a zero mass balance. The result from the zero-balance can be used as guideline values for concentrations of trace metals in the inflowing deep groundwater. It is recommended to install a deep groundwater well in the upstream area and compare measured deep groundwater concentrations with the calculated concentrations from the zero-balance. To further improve the mass balance sampling should continue until a one-year cycle is measured in all points. To install a permanent sampling station to measure concentrations and water flow for the seepage to the north is also considered to be a good approach for improving the credibility of the mass balance. From the vertical profiles of conductivity, temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen saturation measured in the pit lake in October 2010, a permanent stratification with a steep chemical gradient between 7 and 8 meters depth can clearly be observed. The conductivity in the monimolimnion during 2010 was higher than for earlier profile measurements from 2001 to 2004. This observation supports the result from the mass balance, suggesting that metals are continuously accumulating in the pit lake. It is suggested that this observation is followed up by measuring new depth profiles at regular intervals. The largest annual metal fluxes into Lake Hornträsket are observed for Zn (1300 kg), Mn (930 kg) and Fe (380 kg). The impact Rävlidmyran has on Lake Hornträsket is difficult to judge from these figures. One possible approach for getting a better view is to compare the calculated metal transport from Rävlidmyran with the metal transport from the nearby Hornträskviken mine. Another way of assessing the influence from Rävlidmyran is to directly observe the measured concentrations in the two outlets and compare them with local background values. The concentrations of Ba, Cd, Co, Fe, Mn, Ni and Zn are clearly elevated in the surface water streams that enter Lake Hornträsket. The only element that is measured to be higher in the reference point is As. It is possible that the station measuring local background values is influenced by mining activities and thus not representative as a reference point. To clarify this it is suggested that samples for metal analysis are collected further upstream from the reference point, and possibly also from other natural surface streams in the area. It should then be evaluated if the reference point needs to be relocated. Validerat; 20110220 (anonymous...|$|R
