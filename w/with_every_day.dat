5|$|The more skin left {{unarmoured}} and exposed, {{the lower}} a gladiator's {{status and the}} greater his perceived effeminacy. Likewise, the engulfing net may {{have been seen as}} a feminine symbol. The light arms and armour of the retiarius thus established him as the lowliest, most disgraced, and most effeminate of the gladiator types. Helmets allowed both gladiators and spectators to dehumanise the fighters; when an arena combatant had to kill a comrade-at-arms, someone he probably lived and trained <b>with</b> <b>every</b> <b>day,</b> his opponent's helmet added an extra layer of separation. However, the retiarius was allowed no head protection; his face was visible to all. The emperor Claudius had all net-fighters who lost in combat put to death so that spectators could enjoy their expressions of agony. The retiariuss fighting style was another strike against him, as reliance on speed and evasion were viewed as undignified in comparison to the straightforward trading of blows. The retiarii lived in the worst barracks. Some members of the class trained to fight as Samnites, another gladiator type, in order to improve their status.|$|E

500|$|On July 2, 2007, Washington {{appeared}} on Larry King Live, {{to present his}} side of the controversy. According to Washington, he never used the [...] "F Word" [...] in reference to Knight, but rather blurted it out in an unrelated context in the course of an argument [...] "provoked" [...] by Dempsey, who he felt was treating him like a [...] "B-word", a [...] "P-word", and the [...] "F-word", which Washington said conveyed [...] "somebody who is being weak and afraid to fight back". In 2009, Rhimes told Entertainment Weekly that she may not have handled the incident correctly, stating: [...] "I wasn't interested in what anybody thought publicly. I was interested in what was going on right here on the ground...with the people I work <b>with</b> <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> Did I do it perfectly? Of course not. This is my first television show. It was a learning experience." [...] Knight said that Rhimes was among those for discouraging him to come out, however Rhimes said: [...] "I remember saying , 'This is our proudest day here. T.R. got to come out and I got to say to him that it wouldn't affect his character' because he was concerned he was going to come out and George would suddenly be gay. [...] The idea that a gay actor can't play a straight man is insulting." ...|$|E

500|$|Although he did {{not focus}} less on Christian lyrical {{material}} for Undone, mainstream radio was on Millard's mind when he wrote the lyrics on the album. Millard attempted to write lyrics that, while still focused on God, tapped into the things people deal <b>with</b> <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> Further, he avoided using Christian jargon, as {{people who are not}} churchgoers might not understand what those terms mean; instead, he tried to be [...] "clearer in the things [...] were talking about". Another impact on the songwriting was the band's experiences over the previous year; while working on Undone, Millard and {{the other members of the}} band lost eight people close to them. Millard noted that [...] "There's a lot of personal stuff on [...] about the things we've gone through and how Christ has been the solution". One particular song, [...] "Homesick", was written after two incidents. The first incident occurred during the holiday season of 2004; a friend of Millard's lost her twin babies during pregnancy and was so far along in the pregnancy that doctors had to induce labor. After attending the funeral for the two babies, Millard wrote the chorus to the song. However, he didn't write any more to [...] "Homesick" [...] after that as {{he did not}} want to [...] "fake" [...] his way through writing it. Following the death of his brother-in-law Chris, however, Millard finished the song. Although Undone was [...] "essentially complete" [...] at that point, the band recorded and included it on the album.|$|E

You're not on the list," [...] When asked about the song, bass guitarist Guy Berryman said: [...] "It's a story about a king who's lost his kingdom, and all the album's artwork is based on the idea of revolutionaries and guerrillas. There's this slightly anti-authoritarian viewpoint that's crept into some of the lyrics and it's some of the pay-off between being surrounded by governments on one side, but also we're human beings with emotions and we're all going to die and the stupidity of what we have to put up <b>with</b> <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> Hence the album title." ...|$|E

In October, Wilhelm returned to Russia joining Grand Duchess Maria and her brother Dimitri who introduced the Swedish prince to their father, Grand Duke Paul, who was permitted {{to come back to}} Russia for his daughter's wedding set to take place after she turned eighteen the next April.

[...] In her book of memoirs, written more than 20 years later, the grand duchess made different claims: [...] " [...] I was using Wilhelm, in a sense, only to obtain my freedom".
