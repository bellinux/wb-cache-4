5|$|In 1966, {{criticism}} {{over the}} Johnson Administration's {{handling of the}} Vietnam War began to grow, with Ford and Congressional Republicans expressing concern that the United States <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> what was necessary to win the war. Public sentiment also began to move against Johnson, and the 1966 midterm elections saw a 47-seat swing {{in favor of the}} Republicans. This was not enough to give Republicans a majority in the House, but the victory gave Ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further Great Society programs.|$|E
5|$|John F. Kennedy {{campaigned on}} the {{platform}} that Eisenhower was weak on defense and that he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> enough to solve the looming missile gap. After his win in the 1960 elections he was flooded with calls and letters urging that Zeus be continued. This was a concentrated {{effort on the part}} of the Army, who fought back against similar Air Force tactics. They also deliberately spread the Zeus contracts over 37 states in order to gain as much political and industrial support as possible, while taking out advertisements in major mass-market magazines like Life and The Saturday Evening Post promoting the system.|$|E
5|$|When {{this episode}} was being produced, The Bachelorette was a {{bigger and more}} {{prolific}} program than when this episode was originally broadcast. In addition, ABC <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> very well {{at the time of}} this episode's production. The production staff encountered some trouble when deciding what Peter would be doing in the lobby with Cleveland during his Bachelorette audition; although the series could never come up with ideas they deemed to be suitable, they intended for Peter to put his buttocks in an aquarium tank in order to embarrass Cleveland and make him want to leave. This scene was not used, and the production staff used a scene of Peter putting his naked buttocks on Cleveland's naked buttocks; they also shortened this more detailed version and used the less-detailed current version.|$|E

50|$|Kant {{regarded}} punishment as {{a matter}} of justice, which must be carried out by the state {{for the sake of the}} law, not for the sake of the criminal or the victim. He argues that if the guilty <b>are</b> <b>not</b> punished, justice <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>done</b> and if justice <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>done,</b> then the idea of law itself is undermined.|$|R
5|$|He also {{missed the}} {{opportunity}} to lead the original Sinister Six because he felt that joining the group would mean admitting he needed the help of others to rid himself of Spider-Man. Although he later formed the 'Sinister Twelve' when Spider-Man sent him to prison, he expressed anger at Mac Gargan for acquiring the Venom symbiote rather than using the new Scorpion suit provided for him simply because Gargan <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> what he wanted, despite Venom being {{more powerful than the}} Scorpion. When he participated in the mystical ritual known as the Gathering of Five, he appeared convinced that he would automatically receive the gift of power from the ritual– which would bestow upon the participants power, immortality, knowledge, madness and death, respectively– only to receive the gift of madness instead, subsequently requiring an elaborate cocktail of drugs to restore himself to a semblance of sanity. During his time in charge of H.A.M.M.E.R. he was provoked into attacking Asgard by his Goblin side because his ego couldn't allow himself to consider the possibility that the Asgardians wouldn't threaten his power. Later events revealed that Loki at least slightly influenced Osborn's decision to further Loki's own goals. During his attempted takeover of Earth's superhuman security defenses, he was shown reflecting that humans are all barbarians who require the strong like him to control them, dismissing the Avengers as no better than him despite the obvious distinction between Osborn's demands for power and the straightforward respect that the general public have for the Avengers.|$|E
5|$|The {{violence}} and terror of Pontiac's War convinced many western Pennsylvanians that their government <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> {{enough to protect}} them. This discontent was manifested most seriously in an uprising led by a vigilante group {{that came to be}} known as the Paxton Boys, so-called because they were primarily from the area around the Pennsylvania village of Paxton (or Paxtang). The Paxtonians turned their anger towards Native Americans—many of them Christians—who lived peacefully in small enclaves in the midst of white Pennsylvania settlements. Prompted by rumors that a Native war party had been seen at the Native village of Conestoga, on December 14, 1763, a group of more than 50 Paxton Boys marched on the village and murdered the six Susquehannocks they found there. Pennsylvania officials placed the remaining 16 Susquehannocks in protective custody in Lancaster, but on December 27 the Paxton Boys broke into the jail and slaughtered most of them. Governor John Penn issued bounties for the arrest of the murderers, but no one came forward to identify them.|$|E

50|$|There was {{controversy}} surrounding Luclay's punishment as it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>done</b> accordingly. The punishment involved Luclay taking over all dish washing duties {{for as long}} as he is part of the Big brother show. This <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>done</b> and viewers felt that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> fair since Lotus was evicted because of the same confrontation with Luclay.|$|R

He left to organize another party, the Partido de la Independencia. On February 8, 1912, together with Luis Lloréns Torres, Manuel Zeno Gandía and others, {{he wrote a}} manifesto demanding the independence of Puerto Rico from the United States.|$|E
25|$|Fresh {{political}} differences between Libya and Egypt appeared in 1995. Gaddafi criticized Egyptian {{efforts to promote}} economic relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, and said that Egypt <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> enough to support removal of sanctions against Libya. In {{the second half of}} 1995, Libya again expelled Egyptian workers, and also began expelling 30,000 Palestinian workers in retaliation for the P.L.O. making peace with Israel.|$|E

25|$|In 1919, José Coll y Cuchí, {{a member}} of the Union Party, felt that the party <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> enough for the cause of Puerto Rican {{independence}} and with his followers founded the Nationalist Association of Puerto Rico in San Juan. By the 1920s there were two other pro-independence organizations in the Island: the Nationalist Youth and the Independence Association of Puerto Rico. The Independence Association was founded by Alegría, Eugenio Font Suárez and Dr. Leopoldo Figueroa in 1920.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Rieve {{expelled}} his old division, the American Federation of Hosiery Workers, {{from the}} TWUA. The division, which had 20,000 members, {{was a major}} backer of TWUA executive vice-president George Baldanzi. Baldanzi was strongly critical of Rieve's leadership of the union, and argued that Rieve <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> enough to organize new members or win contract improvements. When the Hosiery Workers withheld dues in protest of the Rieve administration's policies, Rieve pulled the division's charter.|$|E
25|$|Lord Raglan {{was also}} the source of various controversies {{over the course of}} his life. In 1938 he {{declared}} his wish to give up his job at the Ministry of Information on the grounds that he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> enough work to justify his salary. In 1958 he agitated Welsh nationalist feelings by declaring Welsh a ‘moribund’ language. Demands were made for his resignation from the National Museum of Wales, but he stood fast. (The motto of the Raglan barony is Mutare vel timere sperno: ‘I scorn to change or to fear’).|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} few years in power Cosgrave's new {{government}} faced a number of problems. The government attempted {{to reduce the size of}} the National Army. During the civil war it had grown to over 55,000 men which, now that the civil war was over, was far too large and costly to maintain. Some army officers challenged the authority of the government to cut the size of the Army. The officers, mostly Pro-Treaty IRA men, were angry that the government <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> enough to help to create a republic and also there would be massive unemployment.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{creation}} of the Agency in 2003, the CBSA has undergone significant changes to its overall structure as services previously offered by different agencies are now housed under a single banner. Not only has the structure of the organization changed, but the range of duties and the institutional priorities have changed. Where the prior coupling of Canada Customs with the Canada Revenue Agency lent itself to a focus on tax collection, the new Agency was created to address heightened security concerns post-9/11, and to respond to criticisms, mostly from the United States, that Canada <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> enough to ensure the security of North America.|$|E
25|$|During the Merdeka Talks of 1956, {{the year}} before Malaya's independence, the British agreed to grant Singapore {{self-government}} over domestic issues, while the British retained control of finance and the military. This seemed to satisfy Marshall initially, but the negotiation later broke down when the British refused to turn over internal security to the local government. The British felt that Marshall <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> enough to counter the threats of the communist insurgency and the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) which had sparked the Malayan Emergency. The march towards independence was stalled and Marshall resigned in 1956 making good on his earlier pledge that he would step down {{in the case of}} failure.|$|E

25|$|Gessle and Fredriksson {{had talked}} about working {{together}} for many years. Fredriksson had done backing vocal work for Gessle's band Gyllene Tider, and they had worked together on Spännande Ostar and other projects, including an attempt by Gyllene Tider to release an English language album in America. Fredriksson's career was soaring in Sweden, but Gessle was a former boyband member whose solo career <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> as well. Friends {{and people in the}} industry were skeptical towards the idea of Marie collaborating with Gessle. His idea was to form a duo, singing in English, and try to have some success in Europe. However, during the 1980s, it was uncommon for Swedish artists to perform in English.|$|E
25|$|On a {{visit to}} Pakistan in 2015, Rice warned Pakistani {{political}} and military leaders that attacks in Afghanistan by militants based in Pakistan threatened regional security. Rice also delivered an invitation from President Obama for Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to visit the United States in October. The meetings came at a tense time for Pakistan's relations with neighboring Afghanistan and archrival India, along with uncertainty over whether the United States would release $300 million in military aid to Pakistan. Media reports suggested the money could be held back if the United States determined Pakistan <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> enough to combat the Haqqani network, accused {{of some of the}} deadliest attacks in neighboring Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{positive}} {{news about the}} Old Post Office Pavilion, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>doing</b> well. GSA imposed conditions on the 1983 renovation that left the retail pavilion looking like an office building rather than a shopping mall. There was also too little retail space, the retail space was poorly configured due to the architectural design of the building, and GSA refused to allow any storefronts on the exterior that would signal that there was retail or restaurants inside. The pavilion's revenues were generated in about equal parts from tourists, local office workers, and local residents. Although most retailers were making money, revenues fluctuated wildly on a seasonal basis. Restaurants {{had a difficult time}} earning money, and turnover among them was high.|$|E
