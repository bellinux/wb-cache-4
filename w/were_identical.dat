5|$|A {{claim was}} made on 17 January 2006, by now former {{developer}} Hartmut Birr on the ReactOS developers mailing list (ros-dev) that ReactOS contained code derived from disassembling Microsoft Windows. The code that Birr disputed involved the function BadStack in syscall.S. {{as well as other}} unspecified items. Comparing this function to disassembled binaries from Windows XP, Birr argued that the BadStack function was simply copy-pasted from Windows XP, given that they <b>were</b> <b>identical.</b> Alex Ionescu, the author of the code, asserted that while the Windows XP binary in question was indeed disassembled and studied, the code was not merely copy-pasted, but reimplemented; the reason why the functions <b>were</b> <b>identical,</b> Ionescu claimed, was because there was only one possible way to implement the function.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the case}} of its {{predecessor}} Landsat 1, the satellite's payload included two remote sensing instruments, the Return Beam Vidicon (RBV) and the Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS). The specifications for these instruments <b>were</b> <b>identical</b> to those of the instruments carried on Landsat 1. The data acquired by the MSS was considered more scientifically useful than the data returned from the RBV, which was rarely used and considered only for engineering evaluation purposes.|$|E
5|$|Following the Local Government Act 1888, the {{remaining}} county {{came under the}} control of Middlesex County Council except for the parish of Monken Hadley, which became part of Hertfordshire. The area of responsibility of the Lord Lieutenant of Middlesex was reduced accordingly. Middlesex did not contain any county boroughs, so the county and administrative county (the area of county council control) <b>were</b> <b>identical.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Z-3 formed part of {{the bomber}} {{versions}} of the Z series, it was, however, also used as a reconnaissance aircraft by the staff flight of the particular unit. The engines and the general equipment <b>were</b> <b>identical</b> to the Z-2 standard; however two cameras — the Rb 50/30 and Rb 20/30 - were incorporated into the crew entry hatch. A handheld camera was issued to the crew to validate the success during bombing missions. Autopilot equipment was added later. The Z-2 and Z-3 <b>were</b> <b>identical</b> visually, and could only be distinguished from each other by the altered crew hatch on the Z-3. Owing to spacing problems because of the added camera equipment, the ammunition supply was reduced from 44 to 42 magazines. The power plant of the Z-3 was upgraded to the Bramo 323P-2. The Bramo P-2 remained the engine of all the remaining Z series variants.|$|E
5|$|A {{military}} {{organization called}} Kölpények {{is reported to}} have existed in Medieval Hungary during the tenth, eleventh and twelfth centuries. Hungarian scholars have proposed that the Kölpények <b>were</b> <b>identical</b> with the Kylfings/Kolbiagi. Hungarian sources regard the Kölpények as being of Scandinavian origin. They were hired by the early rulers of the House of Arpad, particularly Taksony of Hungary in the 950s, to serve as frontier guards. They fought with their Magyar employers alongside Sviatoslav I of Kiev against Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire. Alternatively, the Kölpények may have been of Pecheneg origin, as there was a Pecheneg tribal group called Külbej during roughly the same period.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the newly}} formed BJP was {{technically}} distinct from the Jana Sangh, the bulk of its rank and file <b>were</b> <b>identical</b> to its predecessor, with Vajpayee being its first president. Historian Ramachandra Guha writes that the early 1980s were marked by a wave of violence between Hindus and Muslims. The BJP initially moderated the Hindu nationalist stance of its predecessor the Jana Sangh to gain a wider appeal, emphasising its links to the Janata Party and the ideology of Gandhian Socialism. This was unsuccessful, as it won only two Lok Sabha seats in the elections of 1984. The assassination of Indira Gandhi {{a few months earlier}} resulted in a wave of support for the Congress which won a record tally of 403 seats, contributing to the low number for the BJP.|$|E
5|$|As {{problems}} with the EMD SDP40F mounted, Amtrak adopted the F40PH as its long-term solution nationwide for diesel service. In the spring of 1977 Amtrak traded 40 SDP40Fs back to EMD; components including the prime mover were installed into an F40PH's frame. The 40 rebuilt locomotives were designated F40PHR and <b>were</b> <b>identical</b> to new-build F40PHs, incorporating the larger fuel tank and more powerful HEP generator which had become standard. Amtrak ultimately acquired 132 F40PHRs in this manner, which combined with new orders between 1975–1988, and the purchase of six GMD F40PHs from GO Transit in 1990, led to a fleet of 216 locomotives, the country's largest fleet.|$|E

5|$|During 1999, {{domestic}} air {{ticket prices}} increased 9.2%, and another 17% the following year. By 2001, the domestic capacity was {{below the level}} before Gardermoen opened.

This meant that the prices <b>were</b> <b>identical</b> on all the routes where both airlines flew, although they {{were not allowed to}} make such cooperation with discounted tickets. During the crisis, Braathens had sold several aircraft and started leasing them back to gain liquidity. The company announced in 2000 that they were considering purchasing a smaller type of aircraft, that would replace the 737s on some routes, and that would allow Braathens to start operating the Norwegian Air Shuttle services themselves.|$|E

The wing feathers were brown, red and purplish blue. The upper surface of the tail was dark red fading to blue at the tip, and the under surface of the tail was brownish red.
