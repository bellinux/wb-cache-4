Action scenes are also included.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} Diermot's {{movements and}} actions with a mouse or a gamepad. Diermot {{can pick up}} various objects; these can then be used with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. He can also engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done to solve the puzzles or progress the plot. A few simple action-oriented battle scenes are also included.|$|E
5|$|Broken Sword: The Angel of Death uses both a {{point and}} click and direct control interface. The player guides George Stobbart's {{movements}} with a mouse or keyboard, and Nicole Collard {{is also a}} playable character in selected portions of the game. George must collect objects {{that can be used}} with other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or other people in the game world to solve puzzles and progress in the game. George can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. As in the first three Broken Sword games, the death of the player character is possible in The Angel of Death.|$|E
50|$|It {{was under}} McIntosh's tenure that the Canadian Mennonite University was {{established}}, {{and that a}} Task Force was established and completed recommendations on <b>what</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done <b>to</b> arrange better opportunities for Apprenticeship and Trades training.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{was always}} useless at flirting, and {{simply did not}} know <b>what</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done in order to snare my target... I always ended up resorting to jokes, and most men don't like funny women. They like to do the jokes." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1990s, US Congress held {{hearings}} {{to consider the}} risks and <b>what</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done about them. This led to a US$3 million annual budget for programs like Spaceguard and the near-Earth object program, as managed by NASA and USAF.|$|R
5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon is {{a departure}} from previous instalments in the series, using a direct control interface. The player guides George Stobbart's movements with a keyboard or gamepad, while Nicole Collard is also a playable character at certain times. George must collect objects {{that can be used}} with other collectable objects, parts of the scenery, or other people in the game world in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. George can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. The player has action choices in the bottom right of the screen - there are four circles with anywhere from one to four actions available at any time; the player selects the desired action with the corresponding key. As in the first two Broken Sword games, in The Sleeping Dragon player character death is possible.|$|E
5|$|Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror is a 2D {{adventure}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. Via a point-and-click interface, the player guides protagonist George Stobbart through the game's world and {{interacts with the}} environment by selecting from multiple commands, while Nicole Collard is also a playable character in selected portions of the game. The player controls George's movements and actions with a mouse (PC and PlayStation), or a gamepad (PlayStation). Player can collect objects {{that can be used}} with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. George can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. The player uses a map to travel, and new locations are added to it as the story unfolds. By right clicking on an object, the player gets a description and clues. The player character's death is possible if the player makes a wrong decision.|$|E
25|$|The {{focus on}} {{outcomes}} creates a clear expectation of <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> accomplished {{by the end}} of the course. Students will understand what is expected of them and teachers will know what they need to teach during the course. Clarity is important over years of schooling and when team teaching is involved. Each team member, or year in school, will have a clear understanding of <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> accomplished in each class, or at each level, allowing students to progress. Those designing and planning the curriculum are expected to work backwards once an outcome has been decided upon; they must determine what knowledge and skills will be required to reach the outcome.|$|E
5000|$|The Strategic Convening was {{attended}} by representatives from North Carolina public schools, North Carolina Community College System, University System, industry, nonprofits and others. The group discussed <b>what</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done in the short- and medium-term and discussion fell into four main areas: ...|$|R
40|$|This study <b>was</b> {{conducted}} <b>to</b> {{obtain information}} about a mentoring program {{through the eyes of}} eleventh and twelfth grade student mentors. These students <b>were</b> able <b>to</b> tell <b>what</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> known about {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} this mentoring program and <b>what</b> they felt <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done <b>to</b> make the program more effective and meaningful. This study will serve to inform school leaders who may be planning a peer mentoring program at an educational institution...|$|R

25|$|Parameter: A {{parameter}} is a {{means of}} altering the behaviour of a common piece of functionality, for instance a stored procedure might have different parameters passed to it depending on <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done; these are called parameterised commands.|$|E
25|$|The medical {{decision-making}} (MDM) process involves {{analysis and}} synthesis {{of all the}} above data {{to come up with}} a list of possible diagnoses (the differential diagnoses), along with an idea of <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done to obtain a definitive diagnosis that would explain the patient's problem.|$|E
25|$|With a {{clear sense}} of <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> accomplished, {{instructors}} will be able to structure their lessons around the student’s needs. OBE does not specify a specific method of instruction, leaving instructors free to teach their students using any method. Instructors will also be able to recognize diversity among students by using various teaching and assessment techniques during their class. OBE is meant to be a student-centered learning model. Teachers are meant to guide and help the students understand the material in any way necessary, study guides, and group work are some of the methods instructors can use to facilitate students learning.|$|E
5000|$|Old {{photos and}} Jonathan Blackmer's {{memories}} helped determine <b>what</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done. As much as possible, each {{section of the}} house would look as it had it some point in its history. Glenn Dixon said, [...] "Historically, it's 100 percent original." [...] Interior doors dating <b>to</b> 1820 <b>are</b> still in use.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a review of}} literature, validation, methods, and applications of subjective well-being data in economic analysis. The idea <b>is</b> <b>to</b> provide researchers and policy makers a comprehensive guideline <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considered before embarking on a research in the economics of happiness such as data collection and the validation of happiness scales...|$|R
25|$|Today, {{efforts to}} restore the church to its {{original}} glory continue. The DRCRC is actively involved in raising money for those efforts and promoting the church's historical importance. In 2002 the NPA commissioned the Albany firm Mesick Cohen Wilson Baker to do a Historic Structure Report summarizing <b>what</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done <b>to</b> restore the building.|$|R
25|$|A coxswain is {{the coach}} in the boat, in {{addition}} to following the orders of the team coach, the coxswain {{is connected to the}} way the boat feels, what's working, <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> changed, and how. A successful coxswain must keep track of the drill, time, pace, words of the coach, feel of the boat, direction of the boat, and safety. During a race, a coxswain is responsible for steering, calling the moves, and responding to the way the other boats are moving. Success depends on the physical and mental strength of the rowers, ability to respond to the environment, {{and the way in which}} the coxswain motivates the rowers, not only as individuals but as members of the crew.|$|E
25|$|The {{determinants}} of job performance consist of factors {{having to do}} with the individual worker as well as environmental factors in the workplace. According to Campbell's Model of The Determinants of Job Performance, job performance is a result of the interaction between declarative knowledge (knowledge of facts or things), procedural knowledge (knowledge of <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done and how to do it), and motivation (reflective of an employee's choices regarding whether to expend effort, the level of effort to expend, and whether to persist with the level of effort chosen). The interplay between these factors show that an employee may, for example, have a low level of declarative knowledge, but may still have a high level of performance if the employee has high levels of procedural knowledge and motivation.|$|E
500|$|Jagger's {{relationship}} with bandmate Keith Richards is frequently described as [...] "love/hate" [...] by the media. Richards himself {{said in a}} 1998 interview: [...] "I think of our differences as a family squabble. If I shout and scream at him, it's {{because no one else}} has the guts to do it or else they're paid not to do it. At the same time I'd hope Mick realises that I'm a friend who is just trying to bring him into line and do <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done." ...|$|E
50|$|Every morning, Karber {{went to the}} Pentagon or used a red {{phone to}} call the {{secretary}} and chairman to discuss the scenario being played out. They then talked about <b>what</b> actions <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken by discussing US policy, possible alliance reactions, as well as <b>what</b> moves <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken next. These scenarios took place so reaction times could be improved if something <b>were</b> <b>to</b> happen.|$|R
50|$|A recent {{qualitative}} {{evaluation of}} the Graded Care Profile found that social workers felt the tool was useful in helping them identify the right help for children at risk of harm. It also helped them develop a good working relationship with the family because it allowed them to identify what the family was doing well, in addition <b>to</b> <b>what</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> improved.|$|R
5000|$|Agnew {{joined the}} Green Party in 2003 during its {{campaign}} against the invasion of Iraq. During a protest march from Queen's to the US Consulate, he met John Barry, who convinced him that [...] "the Green Party had a practical agenda of <b>what</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> changed". He came to believe [...] "environmental justice is interlinked" [...] with social justice.|$|R
500|$|Isabella Acres as Rose Crisp: Rose is Ted's preteen daughter. She {{attends the}} Veridian Dynamics daycare program when her nanny is not available, but prefers {{to stay at}} home. According to Ted, [...] "her mom ran off to Africa to go save the world." [...] She is often the voice of reason on the show. When Ted talks with her about work she points out the terrible choices the company makes, and often helps Ted focus on <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done to set things straight. She attends Eugene Debs Elementary School.|$|E
500|$|Sociology {{and applied}} {{sociology}} {{are connected to}} the professional and academic discipline of social work. Both disciplines study social interactions, community and the effect of various systems (i.e. family, school, community, laws, political sphere) on the individual. However, social work is generally more focused on practical strategies to alleviate social dysfunctions; sociology in general provides a thorough examination of the root causes of these problems. For example, a sociologist might study why a community is plagued with poverty. The applied sociologist would be more focused on practical strategies on <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done to alleviate this burden. The social worker would be focused on action; implementing theses strategies [...] "directly" [...] or [...] "indirectly" [...] by means of mental health therapy, counselling, advocacy, community organization or community mobilization.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} year {{following}} the election defeat, Romney generally kept a low profile, with his ordinary daily activities around San Diego being captured via social media glimpses. In December 2012, he joined the board of Marriott International for a third stint as a director. In March 2013, Romney gave a reflective interview on Fox News Sunday, stating, [...] "It kills me not to be there, {{not to be in}} the White House doing <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done". He again expressed regret at the [...] "47 percent" [...] remark, saying [...] "There's no question that hurt and did real damage to my campaign." [...] (He was still echoing both of these sentiments a year later.) [...] Romney began working as executive partner group chairman for Solamere Capital, a private capital firm in Boston owned by his son Tagg. He was also involved in supporting several charitable causes.|$|E
50|$|With this {{research}} under his belt, Hobbs {{took on the}} study of Compatibility, the science of how cars could work together to minimise injuries to the occupants of both vehicles. (53-57) Although the research identified <b>what</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> changed and an assessment procedure was developed, research funding dried up and government interest in further improving car crash safety was absent.|$|R
5000|$|... “ …he {{was a most}} {{efficient}} organaizer, but an organizer not only of administration and action but also of men and women, {{who worked with him}} and for him as loyally as he worked for their common enterprise. … He was essentially a practical man, who saw <b>what</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done and did it, or saw that it was done.” ...|$|R
5000|$|To {{move the}} cursor, T-Square used a Spacewar! game {{controller}} built by Kotok and Saunders in 1962. It {{is not known}} if Saunders was involved in repurposing it for T-Square. Kotok, who was about 20 years old, did participate. He was known for doing <b>what</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done and for taking an interest in [...] "all things ingenious or intriguing." ...|$|R
500|$|Bach {{wrote the}} cantata in 1723 {{in his first}} year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig for the 13th Sunday after Trinity. The {{prescribed}} readings for the Sunday were from the Epistle to the Galatians, Paul's teaching on law and promise (...) , and from the Gospel of Luke, the parable of the Good Samaritan (...) [...] The cantata text was written by Johann Oswald Knauer and appeared in Gotha in 1720 in [...] (Holy singing and playing to God). The text relates closely to the readings, even to the situation in which the parable was told, referring to the question of a lawyer <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done to achieve eternal life. The answer, which the lawyer had to give himself, was the commandment to love God and your neighbour. This, the Great Commandment, is the text of the first movement. Accordingly, the following text is divided in two parts, one recitative and aria dealing with the love of God, and a symmetrical part handling the love of the neighbour.|$|E
500|$|Conker's {{abilities}} are far simpler {{than those of}} previous Rare platform games Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64. The player can run, jump, and smack enemies with a frying pan. Conker also has a few other physical abilities. He can swim underwater for a while until he runs out of breath, climb ladders or ropes, and {{is strong enough to}} push heavy objects. To regain lost health, Conker can eat pieces of [...] "anti-gravity" [...] Chocolate that are scattered throughout the levels. Additionally, the game employs [...] "context sensitive" [...] pads that allow Conker to gain different, temporary abilities when pressing the [...] "B" [...] button atop them. For instance, {{in the beginning of the}} game, by pressing the B button on the first pad he encounters, Conker drinks some Alka-Seltzer to wipe out his hangover, at which point players can proceed forward. Some pads can turn Conker into an anvil to slam into the ground, and some are also used to pull out his shotgun, to activate his throwing knives, slingshot and so on. They also serve to inform players of <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done next.|$|E
500|$|Grim Fandango is an {{adventure}} game, {{in which the}} player controls Manuel [...] "Manny" [...] Calavera (calavera being Spanish for 'skull') as he follows Mercedes [...] "Meche" [...] Colomar in the Underworld. The game uses the GrimE engine, pre-rendering static backgrounds from 3D models, while the main objects and characters are animated in 3D. The player controls Manny's movements and actions with a keyboard, a joystick, or a gamepad. Manny must collect objects {{that can be used}} with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or with other people in the Land of the Dead in order to solve puzzles and progress in the game. The game lacks any type of HUD. Unlike the earlier 2D LucasArts games, the player is informed of objects or persons of interest not by text floating on the screen when the player passes a cursor over them, but instead by the fact that Manny will turn his head towards that object or person as he walks by. The player reviews the inventory of items that Manny has collected by watching him pull each item {{in and out of his}} coat jacket. Manny can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of <b>what</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. As in most LucasArts adventure games, the player can never die or otherwise get into a no-win situation (that prevents completion of the game).|$|E
