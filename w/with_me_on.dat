But she's not really interested in any of it. She just wants to go to school. She says to me, 'Mum, I just want to be a normal kid. I'm not ready for any of that.' I respect that, and if she ever wants to work <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> any level, I welcome it. But otherwise, I leave her to homework and school.|$|E

It's good, because they were {{actually}} knackered {{at the end of the}} day and I said to my mum: 'Ha! Now you know how I feel every day!" [...] Geri Halliwell commented: [...] "I found it a bit bizarre bringing my mum to work <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> the 'Mama' video. You know: 'This is what I do—come and do it, too.' If you worked in Sainsbury's, you wouldn't get your mum to sit with you on the till".|$|E

Penn explained in 2007 that [...] "the original idea was to have me do a young X-Men spin-off, a spin-off of the young X-Men characters.

He complained about his treatment and the British authorities' refusal to let him see an American consul, and promised to take the matter up with the US State Department on his return. An [...] officer named R.H. Price smoothed things over with him on his release on 4 October, explaining what had prompted his arrest and paying his fare back to his hotel. Price reported, [...] "I think he was quite soothed and he shook hands <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> parting."

Afterwards he got a call to provide something to the soundtrack, the singer saw some scenes of [...] "Breaking Dawn" [...] and thought to himself [...] "that song I started might be perfect for this". He admitted to have the tune halfway done before visualizing an early cut of the film and, inspired by its characters, put together the finishing touches. In an interview with Billboard, he went on detail [...] "I just had this melody in my head and basically laid it down after I saw the film." [...] He had to watch [...] "most of the movie" [...] to feel [...] "the vibe", as well as its direction.|$|E
500|$|Broken was {{followed}} by the companion remix EP Fixed in late 1992.

[...] The unedited version appeared on the internet as an 8-bit mono 11kHz file, [...] "NIN_LAST.AIFF", available by FTP from cyberden.com in 1993; it has been removed from the website, but can still be found on p2p networks (Reznor subsequently made it available in higher quality (256kbit/s mp3) at remix.nin.com). [...] Vig later spoke about his remix while answering questions on a music production forum, saying [...] "I started recording a lot of new parts, and took it in a much different direction.

500|$|Although What You Were Hoping For? was {{acclaimed}} by critics, {{it received}} some backlash from Hunt's fanbase and listeners, who were ambivalent about its stylistic departure from his previous work. He addressed the criticism {{in an interview}} for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: [...] "Other recording artists will supply their fans with an album full of songs they will enjoy for 15 or 20 years. I'm a man that grows, progresses and matures, I want to grow [...] {{with the people who}} want to go <b>with</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> that journey ... An artist should put out work that the culture should inspire to as opposed to trying to meet the culture, that's backwards to me. I don't just sit down and worry about what people will like, my job is to express myself as honest as I possibly can." [...] What You Were Hoping For? peaked at number 19 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers Albums, which is a weekly music chart that ranks top-selling albums by new or developing acts, defined as those who have never appeared in the top 100 of the Billboard 200 or in the top 10 of Billboards component charts.
