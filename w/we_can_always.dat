Some, like Macaulay, regarded Johnson as an idiot savant who produced some respectable works, and others, like the Romantic poets, were completely opposed to Johnson's views on poetry and literature, {{especially with regard}} to Milton. However, some of their contemporaries disagreed: Stendhal's Racine et Shakespeare is based in part on Johnson's views of Shakespeare, and Johnson influenced Jane Austen's writing style and philosophy. Later, Johnson's works came into favour, and Matthew Arnold, in his Six Chief Lives from Johnson's [...] "Lives of the Poets", considered the Lives of Milton, Dryden, Pope, Addison, Swift, and Gray as [...] "points which stand as so many natural centres, and by returning to which <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>always</b> find our way again".|$|E

While shooting and releasing Leon, he continued {{to work on the}} script for The Fifth Element, shortening it and reducing the film's budget to $90 million before attempting to find a studio willing to produce it. Columbia Pictures, who had a partnership in Leon, agreed to finance the film. By this time Besson had decided to go with a lesser-known lead actor in order to save on production costs. Besson was in Barry Josephson's office when Willis called regarding a different film. Besson asked to speak to Willis [...] "just to say hello", and told him that The Fifth Element was finally going ahead, explaining the decision to go with a less-expensive actor. After a short silence, Willis stated [...] "If I like the film, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>always</b> come to an arrangement"; he agreed to take on the role after reading the script. Production of the film commenced in early August 1995. Besson traveled to various places for casting, including Paris, London and Rome. He hired Gary Oldman (who had starred in Léon) for the role of Zorg, describing Oldman as [...] "one of the top five actors in the world." [...] For the character Leeloo, Besson chose Milla Jovovich from the 200 to 300 applicants he met in person. The [...] "Divine Language" [...] spoken in the film by Leeloo is a fictional language with only 400 words, invented by Besson. Jovovich and Besson held conversations and wrote letters {{to each other in the}} language as practice. Besson was in a relationship with Maïwenn Le Besco, who played the role of Diva Plavalaguna, for six years when filming commenced; however, he left her for Jovovich during filming. Jovovich and Besson later married, but divorced in 1999.|$|E

The latter are both slow eye movements in response to extended targets, {{with the purpose of}} stabilizing the image. Therefore, some processing stages are shared with the smooth pursuit system. Those different kinds of eye movements may not be simply differentiated by the stimulus that is appropriate to generate them, as smooth pursuit eye movements can be generated to track extended targets as well. The main difference may lie in the voluntary nature of pursuit eye movements.|$|R
