In this paper, a 1 D lumped mass stick slip model is developed, accounting for soil heterogeneity and non linear behaviour, with a base sliding mechanism at a potential rupture surface. The results of the preliminary calibration show a good agreement with frequency-domain site response analysis in no-slip conditions. The comparison with rigid sliding block analyses and with the decoupled approach proves that the stick-slip procedure can result increasingly unconservative for soft soils and deep sliding depths. © 2008 American Institute of Physics...|$|E

The challenges of operationalising children's rights specifically are also associated with different understandings of the nature of adult-child relations. Furthermore, the paper argues that the ambiguities which arise when translating children's rights into practice are partly due to the tensions involved in striking a <b>working</b> <b>balance</b> between children's protection rights as well as their participation rights.

In a legitimacy challenge, mobilized groups of constituents attempt to gain control of and change the institutional rules of the game.

The enforcement of Art. 102 TFEU by the EU Commission, for instance, reveals an underlying mistrust of the operation of markets in the context of collaborative standardization and a strong preference for court-determined FRAND terms. However, the recent CJEU ruling in Huawei v.

Thus, to encourage the entrepreneurial intentions of life scientists, one has to ensure that they are exposed to diverse work experiences, have <b>balanced</b> <b>working</b> time allocations across different activities and work with entrepreneurial peers; i. e., collaborating with colleagues or academic scientists who have started new ventures in the past is important...|$|R

It seems that {{little research has been}} conducted on the key challenges faced in the safeguarding and protecting borders in South Africa. There is a need to investigate why there is lack of a collective approach to border control by all the departments tasked with border control and it is imperative to come up with strategies of redressing the key challenges of border management in order to mitigate the security threats and risks. The purpose of this research is to investigate, the key challenges of South African borders (at the land borders, airports and harbours). This research was qualitative in design. The research intends to explore the challenges in detail, paying attention to destabilizing factors posing threats to national security. Also ensuring that departments and agencies responsible for border control aims at the development and harmonization of migration. This study recommends challenges on border security management are identified to ensure that the National integrated border management strategy is strengthened, and that a <b>working</b> <b>balance</b> between security, trade facilitation, tourism promotion, economic development in Republic of South Africa (RSA) and within the SADC region is created. By so doing, ways to promote and strengthen cooperation with border management counterparts in the SADC region, and inculcate a culture of cooperation and resource sharing so that border security management is strengthened to ensure that security measures that will effectively detect, reduce and deter illegal migration are in place...|$|E
40|$|In {{part one}} of this thesis, the {{interactions}} and resulting complexes between heme proteins and their associated electron-transferring redox partner proteins, termed here as heme protein redox partners, are carefully studied. Such complexes navigate a delicate balance between achieving fast turnover and tight, specific binding. To probe how Nature has balanced these seemingly opposing forces, {{a series of studies}} were conducted on three separate heme protein redox partner systems that have achieved a <b>working</b> <b>balance</b> using different approaches; Cytochrome P 450 cam and its redox partner putidaredoxin, Leishmania major peroxidase and its partner Leishmania major cytochrome c and finally the multi-domain nitric oxide synthase. Each system was initially probed using computational methods including molecular dynamics, Brownian dynamics, and modeling before being experimentally validated against previous findings, novel studies or both. In part two, the focus is shifted from protein interactions to water behavior on organic surfaces. Studying the behavior of water on such organic surfaces can have wide-ranging impacts on our understanding of not only fundamental water dynamics, but also atmospheric chemistry and chemistry on urban surfaces. Self-assembled monolayers (or SAMs) have long served as a model system to probe how differences in organic surface chemistry may affect water behavior. To this point, the behavior of water on a variety of SAMs were investigated using molecular dynamics in a series of studies including one with experimental validation to deepen our understanding of the dependence of water behavior on the structural makeup of both a pristine idealized surface and more realistic defective SAM systems. Finally, three additional separate studies are presented in the third and last part of this thesis. These distinct and independent studies 1) cover the conformational dependence of a central protein residue on the conformation of its neighbors, 2) computationally study the binding of a membrane associated protein to a target lipid in a lipid bilayer and 3) experimentally determine the crystal structure of Bacilus subtillis arginase. When combined with the two series of studies previously presented in this thesis, the great potential in applying a combined experimental and computational approach to address unanswered questions is highlighted and explored...|$|E
40|$|There are 2. 7 {{billion people}} in today s world {{that do not}} have access to clean cooking facilities, leading to immense human and {{environmental}} costs in many developing countries. Cleaner, improved biomass cookstoves (ICS) could be an alternative to the traditional mud stoves that are contributing to these widespread problems. However, the dissemination of ICS models is still low worldwide, especially in the developing country of India. In a country where 170 million households mostly rural rely on solid fuel for cooking, only 4 % have converted from a polluting mud traditional stove to a cleaner ICS model. After various failed initiatives by the government and multi-national corporations, private enterprises are now being called upon to drive the Indian clean cookstove industry. One of the most critical barriers to doing business in rural, emerging markets is distribution access. Furthermore, research on distribution channel design for developing markets has been widely ignored. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify critical factors and barriers for a company that has built a functional distribution channel for disseminating clean cookstoves in rural India. Beginning with a literature review, theoretical ideas from both traditional distribution/marketing theory as well as bottom-of-the-pyramid (BoP) literature are examined. An analytical framework is built based on these different fields of literature in order to analyze the on-the-ground distribution channels of a successful case company. The company selected for this thesis is Greenway Grameen. This company is active in eight Indian states and is among the top-selling cookstove companies in the Indian cookstove industry. Data about this company is collected via interviews with two Greenway employees and with two representatives from third-party organizations active in the clean-tech industry in developing countries. Based on the results, this thesis has identified critical factors and barriers that the case company has faced both in its rural marketing and distribution channels. This thesis contributes both to practice and theory. For practitioners, this thesis makes recommendations on how to effectively design marketing and distribution channels for rural areas. For a rural marketing channel, this thesis recommends a combination of above-the-line (ATL) and below-the-line (BTL) marketing channels, where ATL methods such as TV can increase brand legitimacy. Also recommended are BTL product demonstrations that utilize already-existent networks. This thesis also emphasizes that companies must learn to work within constraints caused by weak legal environments often found in emerging markets. Another important recommendation is that companies focus on creating a <b>working</b> <b>balance</b> of internalizing and outsourcing distribution activities. Consistent contact with partners is also recommended. Finally, not only is a customer-centric product design important, but also that this is in focus early in a business s development. For researchers, this thesis recommends various useful frameworks for analyzing rural distribution channels. First both traditional distribution and BoP fields of literature should be referenced when analyzing aspects of rural channels. Additionally, this thesis recommends using the traditional 4 Rs (Christopher, 2011) framework to study rural distribution. The 4 Rs helps describe a channel s structure and its dynamic management. Finally, the thesis contributes a new, adapted version of the 4 Rs framework that is specifically designed for analyzing rural distribution channels. Further development of this model is recommended.

First, we extend the term “financial sustainability ” putting together financial and nonfinancial indicators and metrics. We regard this as an answer on present-day challenges of turbulent environment, the turbulent nature of economic activity. Secondly, we suggest a system of indicators of financial sustainability analysis. It includes service quality and management quality indicators, financial ratios and other indicators and operating risk indicators.
