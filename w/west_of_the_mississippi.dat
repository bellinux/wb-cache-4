5|$|Thanks to the {{decision}} of Potawatomi leaders to aid the U.S. during the war, American officials did not seize tribal land as war reparations. Instead, only three individuals accused of leading the Indian Creek massacre were tried in court; they were acquitted. Nevertheless, the drive to purchase Potawatomi land <b>west</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> began in October 1832, when commissioners in Indiana bought {{a large amount of}} Potawatomi land, even though not all Potawatomi bands were represented at the treaty. The tribe was compelled to sell their remaining land <b>west</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> in a treaty held in Chicago in September 1833.|$|E

At the Treaty of Paris on February 10, 1763, Great Britain recognized Spain's right to the lands <b>west</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi.</b> Great Britain received the remainder of France's North American territories, and Spain exchanged some of their holdings in Florida for Havana.|$|E

5|$|General Kirby Smith {{tried to}} send {{reinforcements}} from his Army of the Trans-Mississippi {{east of the}} Mississippi River to relieve Vicksburg, Mississippi, {{in the spring of}} 1864 following the Battle of Mansfield and the Battle of Pleasant Hill. This was not practicable due to the Union naval control of the Mississippi River. Smith instead dispatched Major General Sterling Price and his cavalry on an invasion of Missouri that was ultimately not successful. Thereafter the war <b>west</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River was principally one of small raids. By May 26 a representative of Smith's negotiated and signed surrender documents with a representative of Major General Edward Canby. Canby in Shreveport, Louisiana, then took custody of Smith's force of 43,000 soldiers when they surrendered, by then the only significant Confederate forces left <b>west</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River.

5|$|Most early St. Louisans {{remained}} illiterate {{through the}} 1810s, although many wealthy merchants purchased books for private libraries. Early schools in St. Louis were all fee-based and mostly conducted lessons in French. The first substantial educational effort came about {{under the authority}} of the Catholic Church, which in 1818 opened Saint Louis Academy, later renamed Saint Louis University. In 1832, the college applied for a state charter, and in December 1832, it became the first chartered university <b>west</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River. Its medical school opened in 1842, with faculty that included Daniel Brainard (founder of Rush Medical College), Moses Linton (founder of the first medical journal <b>west</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mississippi</b> River in 1843), and Charles Alexander Pope (later president of the American Medical Association). However, the university primarily catered to seminary students rather than the general public, and only in the 1840s did the Catholic Church offer large scale instruction at parochial schools. In 1853, William Greenleaf Eliot founded a second university in the city â€“ Washington University in St. Louis. During the 1850s Eliot founded Smith Academy for boys and Mary Institute for girls, which later merged and became Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School.|$|E
