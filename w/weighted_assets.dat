We find that high risk <b>weighted</b> <b>asset</b> ratios tend to attract supervisory intervention. Sanctions whose cause lies {{at the core of}} bank safety and soundness curtail the risk-weighted asset ratio, but amplify the risk of insolvency and returns volatility, which implies that these sanctions do not improve the risk profile of the involved banks, possibly because they come too late. Sanctions targeting internal control and risk management weaknesses appear to be well-timed and to restrain further increases in the risk-weighted assets ratio without impairing bank fundamentals. Sanctions against institution-affiliated parties do not seem to affect bank behavior. We suggest that supervisory attention should be placed on the timely uncovering of internal control and risk management deficiencies as this would allow the early tackling of the origins of financial distress. ...|$|R

However, when use non-performing asset to total asset ratio as a credit risk measurement, we find a negative relationship between securitization and bank’s credit risk taking, and both findings are statistically significant for period 2001 to 2007. After we decompose the aggregate securitization, we find that various underlying assets have mixed effects of the overall impact of securitization on bank’s credit risk taking behaviour, with the Family Residential Loans tend to always contribute the most to the aggregate securitization’s impact. In sum, we conclude that the impact is ambiguous and the relationship will depend on the economic conditions...|$|R

40|$|Background/Objective: To {{determine}} the equality in safe delivery indices, i. e., appropriate place of delivery, type of delivery and skilled attendant for delivery, and their determinants in Iran. Methods: This study was performed using {{the data of}} Iran demographic and health survey, performed in 2000. Our sample was nationally representative and included 17, 991 Iranian married women aged 10 – 49 years who had delivered during {{two years before the}} survey. The equality status was assessed by concentration index. The relationship between different factors and safe delivery was investigated by logistic regression. These factors included age, occupation, resident place (urban vs. rural), mother’s educational level and household economic status (<b>weighted</b> <b>asset</b> index). Results: Concentration index (95 % CI) for appropriate place of delivery, normal vaginal delivery and skilled attendant for delivery, were 0. 111 (0. 107 to 0. 115),- 0. 100 (- 0. 105 to- 0. 095) and 0. 095 (0. 091 to 0. 099), respectively. In other words, the opportunity of delivery in appropriate place and by skilled attendant were more common in those with higher economic levels; while normal vaginal delivery was less common. Also, mother's age and educational level had significant correlation with safe delivery indices; in all cases mother's education was the most important factor. Conclusion: In spite of the improvement in delivery care in Iran during the past decades, there are significant differences between the current situations of safe delivery in people with different socioeconomic states...|$|R

The paper finds that FSIs fluctuate strongly with both the business cycle and the inflation rate. Short term interest rates and the real exchange rate also emerge as important determinants. There is also a considerable degree of heterogeneity {{in the relationship between}} macroeconomic indicators and FSIs across the sample of countries.

40|$|The {{financial}} and banking crises {{around the world}} have prompted the regulators to revise, among others, the capital level of the banks to deal with the excessive risks taken by the banks, both conventional and Islamic. This study is the first attempt to investigate the relationship between risky assets and capital level in a mixed banking system applying the panel VECM and dynamic GMM estimators. The Malaysian mixed banking system is used as a case study taking panel data covering the period from December 2006 to October 2013. Our statistical results based on dynamic OLS (DOLS) tend to indicate that there is a positive relationship between the capital ratio (CAR) and risk <b>weighted</b> <b>asset</b> ratio (RWA) in the long run and also, the causality analysis based on panel VECM and two-step dynamic System GMM tends to indicate unidirectional causality in that the RWA is positively driven by CAR. Our results appear to suggest that higher capital buffer (excess capital above regulatory capital requirement) might have opened up more space for bank managers to taking risky positions while assisted by increasing domestic demand for credit facilities under favorable economic condition of Malaysia. In other words, high capital growth and capital buffer provides an extra cushion for Malaysian banks to pursue relatively riskier financing activities. For the full-fledge Islamic banks (IB) and Islamic bank subsidiaries (IBS), the existence of a cointegrating relationship between RWA and CAR suggests that the way the managers of Islamic banks behave towards risky assets follows the conventional practice. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of the new capital {{requirements}} introduced under the Basel III framework on bank lending rates and loan growth. Higher capital requirements, by raising banks’ marginal cost of funding, lead to higher lending rates. The data presented in the paper suggest that large banks would on average need to increase their equity-to-asset ratio by 1. 3 percentage points under the Basel III framework. GMM estimations indicate that this would lead large banks to increase their lending rates by 16 basis points, causing loan growth to decline by 1. 3 percent in the long run. The results also suggest that banks’ responses to the new regulations will vary considerably from one advanced economy to another (e. g. a relatively large impact on loan growth in Japan and Denmark and a relatively lower impact in the U. S.) depending on cross-country variations in banks’ net cost of raising equity and the elasticity of loan demand with respect to changes in loan rates.
