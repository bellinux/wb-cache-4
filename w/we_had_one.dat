There has been just tremendous timidity {{on the part of the}} party, generally, although there have been a handful of exceptions. But, you know, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> member of the United States Senate vote against the PATRIOT Act, the blank check that was given by Congress to this president, I think in total abrogation of the role of Congress under separation of powers and under the power to make war, to declare war. They gave that away to a president that didn’t have his facts straight and, I think, was manipulating the intelligence to sell this war.|$|E
25|$|Is {{there anybody}} {{anywhere}} today, I sometimes wonder, {{who had the}} opportunities which were mine, during three score and ten years of my adult life, to enjoy wonderful wines, the like of which the post-wars generations will never know, and the privilege to enjoy them with such wonderful friends? I doubt it. One of my oldest friends–he was born in 1847–was Sir James Agg-Gardner, a little man and a great lover of wine: he was M.P. for Cheltenham, and Chairman of the Kitchen Committee of the House of Commons; {{he was one of}} a few friends who lunched with me at my old Mark Lane headquarters, in 1918, to celebrate my return to civilian life. There were still, on that day, four magnums of Cockburn 1847 in the cellar; <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> of them and it really was magnificent! We were {{on the eve of a}} General Election and we all drank good luck to Sir James in the wine of his own vintage. I promised him, somewhat rashly, another magnum of 1847 Cockburn, should he be re-elected. He was re-elected, of course, not only that year, but twice again during the next twelve months: it took three elections in two years to get a working majority, and this was why and how my last three magnums of Cockburn 1847 went in two years! No regrets: they were at their best and could not possibly have been any better had they been kept any longer.|$|E

Hubbard's grandfather, Lafe Waterbury, briefly owned {{a plot of}} land covering 320acres (0.5mi2) near Kalispell, where he pastured horses {{and worked as a}} veterinarian. A local city directory for 1913 stated Waterbury's assets as a relatively modest $1,550. The Hubbards and Waterburys lived in a pair of townhouses, not a ranch, in the center of Helena, only two blocks from each other and not far from the Montana State Capitol. They also owned a small plot outside the city. Hubbard's aunt told the Los Angeles Times in 1990 that the family did not have a ranch, [...] "just several acres (with) a barn on it.... <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> cow (and) four or five horses." ...|$|E

[...] In the subsequent post-race press conference, Hamlin said, [...] "Anytime that Jimmie is down is not usually because of performance, it's usually because of an incident like last week. There was {{no doubt in my mind}} they were going to come this week and make a statement. Obviously leading all the laps pretty much and winning the race sends a statement out there that he is the best, that they're not going to be denied this year." ...|$|E
500|$|Chatwin's {{early years}} were spent moving {{regularly}} {{with his mother}} while his father was at sea. Prior to his birth, Chatwin's parents had lived at Barnt Green, Worcestershire, but Margharita moved to her parents' house in Dronfield, near Sheffield, shortly before giving birth. [...] Mother and son remained there {{for only a few}} weeks. Worried about Nazi bombs, Margharita sought a safer place to stay. She took her son with her as they travelled to stay with various relatives during the war. They would remain in one place until Margharita decided to move, either because of concern for their safety, or because of friction among family members. [...] Later in life Chatwin recalled of the war, [...] "Home, if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>one,</b> was a solid black suitcase called the Rev-Robe, in which there was a corner for my clothes and my Mickey Mouse gas mask." ...|$|E

I was trying to make something happen and got in the wall which ended up killing our car. The good part about that is I was able to save fuel because there was no pressure from behind. I was able to save fuel and our Camry got the best fuel mileage it got all day." [...] Kyle Busch's crew chief Dave Rogers said of his drivers' performance, [...] "I think he handled it well -- it's tough. You lead all these laps and he could have gone for the clean sweep this weekend -- win all three in a row. He deserved to win all three in a row and to get beat -- it's tough.", he continued, [...] "We're disappointed -- this Toyota deserved to be in Victory Lane.

500|$|The 2nd Raiders {{suffered}} 16killed and 17wounded (plus 2wounded native guides). Non-battle casualties totaled 225, {{of which}} 125suffered from malaria, 29 from dysentery, and 71 from ringworm or jungle rot. Most {{of the remaining}} raiders were also suffering some type of physical ailment. On 17 December, the raiders departed Guadalcanal by ship and arrived back at their home camp on Espiritu Santo on 20 December. At Espiritu Santo, the unit continued {{to be affected by}} the lingering tropical diseases many had contracted during the Guadalcanal patrol. In the second week of March 1943, the 2ndRaiders were declared unfit for combat duty, although this finding was never announced in an official document. The 2nd Marine Raiders did not participate as a unit in a combat operation until the Bougainville campaign beginning on 1 November 1943. In spite of the high fallout from disease, Carlson's troops generally felt that they had performed well as a unit during the patrol and had accomplished their mission. Cleland E. Early—a lieutenant in Carlson's Company E—described the long Guadalcanal patrol and the effect on his unit: [...] "Enduring the living conditions was worse than the combat. My platoon went in with 30men, one corpsman and one officer. When we came out <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> officer, one corpsman, and 18enlisted, all of whom had malaria, worms, diarrhea, jungle rot and high morale.|$|E
500|$|Leaving Levene in {{the late}} 1980s to become a {{freelance}} stylist in television advertising, MTV and film, Everest began styling bands and pop stars such as George Michael. He recognised a shift in perception of the male fashion industry; men had become more label conscious. This had coincided with the increased awareness of top-end fashion designers, like Hugo Boss and Armani, highlighted by men's lifestyle magazines; such as Arena and The Face. He said, [...] "I thought {{that if we could}} demystify bespoke tailoring and make it more accessible, as well as really understanding {{what was going on in}} ready-to-wear fashion and being directional with it, there was possibly a market there." [...] Having decided to create the Timothy Everest brand as an alternative to 'designer' ready-to-wear, he searched for a suitable location away from [...] "the stuffiness of Savile Row". Everest opened his first premises in 1989; in Princelet Street, Spitalfields, just outside the City of London, in the East End. He said, [...] "We started in one room of a house. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> rail with four garments on and a telephone, no chairs, no furniture." [...] To begin with, business was slow. Moving premises in 1993, he chose a three-storey, early Georgian townhouse (built in 1724), just north of Old Spitalfields Market in nearby Elder Street – the former home of artist Mark Gertler (1891–1939) – converting it to an atelier over seven weeks. He dressed Tom Cruise for the 1996 film [...] Cruise liked the suits so much that he kept them, and commissioned Everest to make him some more.|$|E

Captain Gonzaullas and Sheriff Presley discounted these allegations. Surprised at the credence locals gave them, Gonzaullas also stated that it [...] "hindered the investigation because of the time it was necessary to consume tracking it down. The spreading of the rumor certainly was an injustice to the family and the boy, because it absolutely is not so. We do not have any minister's son in custody at this time, nor have <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> in custody or questioned a minister's son relative to this crime." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 2006, Scott {{announced}} {{a remake of}} the action thriller The Warriors (1979). [...] "The original Warriors was New York in the 1970s, and everything went upwards, everything went vertically. And now I'm making it a contemporary thing and doing it in L.A., so everything is horizontal. So my vision of The Warriors is Los Angeles in 2007 and the gangs, instead of being 30, {{are going to be}} 3,000 or 5,000," [...] he said. Scott met with actual gang members for research: [...] "I've met all the heads of all the different gangs, so I've already educated myself. They all said, 'Listen dude, if you get this on we'll sign a treaty and we'll all stand on the Long Beach Bridge. There'll be 150,000 members there. It'll look like the L.A. Marathon. Scott was simultaneously developing a drama project titled Emma's War about British foreign aid worker Emma McCune. Scott said in October 2006, [...] "It's been a difficult piece to crack. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> writer aboard who did a pass at the script and didn't get it, but we've got someone else onboard now who I'm going to make live down there and smell it, touch it, feel it.
