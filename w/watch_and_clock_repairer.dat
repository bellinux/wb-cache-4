50|$|The Dreger Clock {{was built}} by Andrew Dreger Sr., whose family were pioneers to the early {{settlements}} of Anaheim, Long Beach and Buena Park. Andrew developed many mechanical skills during his life. He repaired bicycles and mechanical items, he worked with metal as a blacksmith and other jobs requiring mechanical and hand crafting skills. Toward the latter {{years of his life}} he took up <b>watch</b> <b>and</b> <b>clock</b> <b>repair.</b> Soon he became fascinated with the idea of building a large electrically powered clock that could tell the time in major cities around the world.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} on December 1, 1837, in Muhlen-am-Neckar, {{a small town in}} the Baden-Wurtemberg region of {{southern}} Germany. His parents' names were Veit Hirsch Weyl and Emma Miriam Goetz. In 1853 his family emigrated to Williamsport, Pennsylvania, where Weyl worked in <b>watch</b> <b>and</b> <b>clock</b> <b>repair,</b> a trade he had learned through an early apprenticeship. In 1857, he moved to Washington, D.C. and became a jeweler with a retail store on 7th Street NW in a building that still stands and currently is used as a Ruby Tuesday restaurant across from the Verizon Center. Weyl married Miriam Raff and had several children including Mathilda, Henry and Adolph. Weyl began to paint as a hobby and displayed some of his works in his shop window. Weyl also was active in the then-small Washington Jewish community.|$|R
50|$|After its {{incorporation}} the village continued to prosper, the downtown district was mostly complete by the 1870s, with all commercial lots purchased and improved. Mel Trotter who established {{a chain of}} rescue missions during his lifetime, {{was born in the}} village on May 16, 1870 and lived there until he was five years old when his family moved to Polo, Illinois. By 1877, the village population was up to 300 and in 1883 the Orangeville Alert, the first village newspaper, was established. In 1887, the Illinois Central Railroad decided to link Freeport to Madison, Wisconsin. The only incorporated village along that line was Orangeville, the railroad came in 1888 and led to commercial building boom. This building boom directly resulted in 14 new buildings being erected downtown, all brick buildings downtown save the 1906 Wagner Building and the 1899 R.W. Moore Building were a result of the railroad. Between 1888 and 1914, numerous business developed along the corridor of Main and High Streets, those included: restaurants, drug stores, barber shops, banks, <b>watch</b> <b>and</b> <b>clock</b> <b>repair</b> shops, cigar factory, funeral parlor and casket factory, among several others.|$|R
50|$|John McKay, who {{conducted}} a <b>watch</b> <b>and</b> <b>clock</b> <b>repair</b> business in Rutland for years, {{was a native}} of Missouri. He married Miss Taylor in that state in 1869. She was the daughter of pioneers in this state and before her marriage was a teacher at Pleasant Valley country school. Mr. McKay lived until he was ninety-five, being the last survivor of the Civil War in the county. Even in advancing years he had a keen mind and his interesting conversation was livened by his unusual wit. The Rutland Record in August 1926 gives an account of his journey home after discharge from the army, at the age of about nineteen. He was in a hospital in Wisconsin and he wished to go to Ft. Scott, Kansas. There was only one rail road in Kansas, and the stage coach was his chief means of travel. There were floods and streams swollen and some bridges washed out, so the stage couldn't run and he was at times obliged to walk many miles to cross streams. Mr. McKay has two children living in Rutland, Mrs. Honas Decker and Mrs. Luella Butcher.|$|R
