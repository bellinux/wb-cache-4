25|$|A {{comparable}} {{but even}} more remarkable, yet effectual, use of natural ultramarine is in The Girl with a <b>Wineglass.</b> The shadows of the red satin dress are underpainted in natural ultramarine, and, owing to this underlying blue paint layer, the red lake and vermilion mixture applied over it acquires a slightly purple, cool and crisp appearance that is most powerful.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{distinctive}} shape, likened to a <b>wineglass,</b> the building stands {{out from the}} rest of the Admiralty waterfront buildings. Architects attribute the shape of the building to passive protection, its narrow stem with the protruding upper storeys, supposedly makes it difficult to climb or attack. It is also informally known as 'the upside-down Gin bottle due to its shape resembling a bottle of Gordon's Gin. The corner of the building at the podium level which faces east (towards Admiralty MTR station) used to be a chapel under British use of the barracks. There used to be a crucifix visible on the exterior—however, during external refurbishment (including replacing the 'Prince of Wales Building' inscription in English with its current name in Chinese), the cross was removed.|$|E

500|$|Stream {{gradients}} increased on flanking {{mountain ranges}} {{as they were}} uplifted. These swifter moving streams are dry {{most of the year}} but have nevertheless cut true river valleys, canyons, and gorges that face Death and Panamint valleys. [...] In this arid environment, alluvial fans form at the mouth of these streams. Very large alluvial fans merged to form continuous alluvial slopes called bajadas along the Panamint Range. The faster uplift along the Black Mountains formed much smaller alluvial fans because older fans are buried under playa sediments before they can grow too large. Slot canyons are often found at the mouths of the streams that feed the fans, and the slot canyons in turn are topped by V-shaped gorges. This forms what looks like a <b>wineglass</b> shape to some people, thus giving them their names, [...] "wineglass canyons".|$|E
500|$|David reduced {{her writing}} {{commitments}} {{to concentrate on}} running the shop, but contributed some articles to magazines, and began {{to focus more on}} English cuisine. She still included many recipes but increasingly wrote about places—markets, , farms—and people, including profiles of famous chefs and gourmets such as Marcel Boulestin and Édouard de Pomiane. In her later articles, she expressed strongly held views {{on a wide range of}} subjects; she abominated the word [...] "crispy", demanding to know what it conveyed that [...] "crisp" [...] did not; she confessed to an inability to refill anybody's <b>wineglass</b> until it was empty; she insisted on the traditional form [...] "Welsh rabbit" [...] rather than the modern invention [...] "Welsh rarebit"; she poured scorn on the Guide Michelin's standards; she deplored [...] "fussy garnish... distract from the main flavours"; she inveighed against the ersatz: [...] "anyone depraved enough to invent a dish consisting of a wedge of steam-heated bread spread with tomato paste and a piece of synthetic Cheddar can call it a pizza." ...|$|E

2500|$|Two pedestalled dishes also form a pair. [...] They were {{originally}} {{thought to be}} stemmed cups with wide, flat bases, somewhat like a modern <b>wineglass</b> in shape, but the foliate pattern on the 'bases' and the relatively unfinished interiors of the 'cups' show that they were used the other way up, as small (115mm diameter) flat dishes on a stem with a bowl-shaped base. [...] Vessels of the same shape occur in the Traprain Law treasure, found in 1919.|$|E
2500|$|The {{shape of}} a <b>wineglass</b> can have a subtle impact on the {{perception}} of wine, especially its bouquet. Typically, the ideal shape {{is considered to be}} wider toward the bottom, with a narrower aperture at the top (tulip or egg shaped). Glasses which are widest at the top are considered the least ideal. Many wine tastings use ISO XL5 glasses, which are [...] "egg"-shaped. Interestingly, the effect of glass shape {{does not appear to be}} related to whether the glass is pleasing to look at.|$|E
2500|$|The Singing Bell {{technique}} {{creates a}} sustained pitch {{similar to the}} sound a <b>wineglass</b> makes as its rim is rubbed with a wet fingertip and is accomplished {{in much the same}} way. A short wooden dowel is touched to the outside of the rim of a handbell which is being held in the other hand. The dowel is then used to rub the rim in a circular motion. The Singing Bell technique is adapted from the [...] "Singing Bowl" [...] tradition [...] of Tibet.|$|E

2500|$|The altarpiece, {{twenty feet}} high and fifteen wide, is in wainscot, with Ionic decorations. As per Anglican {{requirements}} it displays the Apostles' Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments. In the pediment window is a cross, 42 inches high, carved of walnut from Mount Vernon and faced with gold leaf. The church is provided with a modern tracker organ, completed by Fritz Noack in 1969 to a design by Charles Fisk, with carvings executed by Roger Martin. This instrument contains 880 pipes, with thirteen stops and seventeen ranks. The pulpit, also Ionic in its fittings, is carved of pine, as are its canopy and the reading desks; the gold leaf used to execute portions of its decoration was donated by George Washington. Its base is formed in the <b>wineglass</b> style. Below the pew box under the pulpit is the grave of the Reverend Lee Massey, last colonial rector of Truro Parish; his remains were removed to the church in 1908 from the former site of his house, Bradley, {{the first in a}} series of reinterments of early parishioners in the church and churchyard. The entirety of the church interior is painted a putty color, which serves to unify the various architectural elements within, as does the clarity of the design of the space as a whole.|$|E

5000|$|Character is a {{solo album}} {{recorded}} by Kent {{in her home}} studio in New York City. The compositions on the album are built around Kent's layered, multi-tracked cello, electronics as well as found sounds. In an interview, Kent said about the album, [...] "“The Incorporated sounds are important...They contrast and complement the cello, my primary instrument, and also evoke {{the concept of a}} voice without being, literally, a voice. So I used a lot of found and processed sounds to try to achieve that: from matches being struck, to <b>wineglasses,</b> to the sound of pen on paper, to an ancient autoharp that, over time, ended up being detuned in a way that created an amazing sonority.” ...|$|R

She asked me to manifest for her. She says to trust this girl and to carry a message of love to Henry. I brought one of her colonial <b>wineglasses</b> with me--as a sign of her presence and as a test of the power we have of passing through matter." ...|$|R
5000|$|The skull {{becomes an}} icon itself when its painted {{representation}} becomes {{a substitute for}} the real thing. Simon Schama chronicled the ambivalence of the Dutch to their own worldly success during the Dutch Golden Age {{of the first half of}} the 17th century in The Embarrassment of Riches. The possibly frivolous and merely decorative nature of the still life genre was avoided by Pieter Claesz in his [...] "Vanitas" [...] (illustration, below right): Skull, opened case-watch, overturned emptied <b>wineglasses,</b> snuffed candle, book: [...] "Lo, the wine of life runs out, the spirit is snuffed, oh Man, for all your learning, time yet runs on: Vanity!"

5000|$|As Solicitor-General, he {{is remembered}} mainly for the {{somewhat}} malicious [...] "compliments" [...] paid {{to him by}} the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, Sir Peter O'Brien, in the celebrated 1894 case of R. (Bridgeman) v. Drury. Hemphill, who appeared for Dublin Corporation, had argued, apparently with a good deal of hyperbole, that the members of the Corporation were entitled to charge the ratepayers of Dublin for an especially lavish picnic. The Lord Chief Justice paid ironic tribute to Hemphill's eloquence and persuasiveness, but added drily that he had entirely failed to persuade the Court that the members of the Corporation would [...] "starve" [...] if they were unable to make the ratepayers foot the bill for fine claret, whiskey and cigars, {{to say nothing of the}} broken <b>wineglasses</b> (although there were only four of them, which the judge fairly noted seemed quite moderate in the circumstances).|$|R
60|$|Long {{after these}} {{constitutional}} powers had dispersed, my sister lay very ill in bed. Her sight was disturbed, {{so that she}} saw objects multiplied, and grasped at visionary teacups and <b>wineglasses</b> instead of the realities; her hearing was greatly impaired; her memory also; and her speech was unintelligible. When, at last, she came round {{so far as to}} be helped down stairs, it was still necessary to keep my slate always by her, that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicate in speech. As she was (very bad handwriting apart) a more than indifferent speller, and as Joe was a more than indifferent reader, extraordinary complications arose between them which I was always called in to solve. The administration of mutton instead of medicine, the substitution of Tea for Joe, and the baker for bacon, were among the mildest of my own mistakes.|$|R
60|$|From {{that time}} Fan was {{compelled}} to fare delicately, and each day {{in place of the}} simple quickly-eaten and soon-forgotten chop, there came to her table a soup with some new flavour, a bit of fish--salmon cutlets, or a couple of smelts, or dainty whitebait with lemon and brown bread-and- butter, or a red mullet in its white wrapper--and exquisitely-tasting little made dishes, and various sweets of unknown names. Nor was there wanting bright colour to relieve the monotony of white napery and please the eye--wine, white and red, in small cut-glass decanters, and rose and amber-coloured <b>wineglasses,</b> and rich-hued fruits and flowers. Of all the delicacies provided for her she tasted, yet never altogether free from the painful thought that while she was thus faring sumptuously, many of her fellow-creatures were going about the streets hungry, even as she had once gone about wishing for a penny to buy a roll. Still, Mrs. Fay was happy now, and that was one advantage gained, although her lodger was paying dearly for it with somebody's money.|$|R
