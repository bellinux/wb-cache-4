Daley {{was a member of the}} Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, an organization formed in 2006 and co-chaired by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino. On January 17, 2006, during Daley's fifth term, at a joint press conference with Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich calling for a statewide ban on semi-automatic assault weapons, Daley said, [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> to make the progress that we want, we have to keep the most dangerous weapons that are right here off of our streets." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{turning point}} came for {{development}} in the Everglades at the proposition of an expanded airport after Miami International Airport outgrew its capacities. The new jetport was planned to be larger than O'Hare, Dulles, JFK, and LAX airports combined, and the chosen location was [...] north of Everglades National Park. The first sentence of the U.S. Department of Interior study of {{the environmental impact of}} the jetport read, [...] "Development of the proposed jetport and its attendant facilities... will inexorably destroy the south Florida ecosystem and thus the Everglades National Park". When studies indicated the proposed jetport would create [...] of raw sewage a day and [...] of jet engine pollutants a year, the project met staunch opposition. The New York Times called it a [...] "blueprint for disaster", and Wisconsin senator Gaylord Nelson wrote to President Richard Nixon voicing his opposition: [...] "It is a test of whether or not <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> committed in this country to protecting our environment." [...] Governor Claude Kirk withdrew his support for the project, and Marjory Stoneman Douglas was persuaded at 79years old to go on tour to give hundreds of speeches against it.

500|$|Ion Storm {{solicited}} {{feedback from}} fans after demonstrating progress on Anachronox at E3 1998, and assured {{inclusion of a}} multiplayer mode. Tom Hall touted, [...] "It {{is going to be}} very cinematic and about as non-linear as you can get. Some levels will be bigger than anything ever seen in a 3-D environment. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> pushing the engine for this, with loads of textures." [...] Developers made two demonstrations; the second featured lasers, lens flare, and volumetric fog. The gaming press received Anachronox well; one reporter wrote the game was [...] "stunningly beautiful... some of the most superb effects ever seen in a computer game, including rippling water, stunning laser lights and shadow effects". Another wrote that the game would be [...] "graphically spectacular, with detailed characters". Panelists at E3 nominated Anachronox in the [...] "Most Promising Game" [...] and [...] "Best RPG" [...] categories for the Game Critics Awards. Ion Storm planned for a 1999 release, and unveiled new screenshots at the 1998 European Computer Trade Show. Among the game's maps developed in 1998 were Hephaestus (polished by David Namaksy); Whitendon (Iikka Keränen); Democratus, [...] "Matrix 0", and certain interiors of Anachronox (Larry Herring); and the city of Limbus (Rich Carlson). Lead programmer Joey Liaw left Ion Storm to attend Stanford University in mid-1998. That November, several developers at Ion Storm departed to form their own company; among them was David Namaksy, lead level designer for Anachronox.|$|E
500|$|When studies {{indicated}} the proposed jetport would create [...] of raw sewage {{a day and}} [...] of jet engine pollutants a year, the national media snapped to attention. Science magazine wrote, in a series on environmental protection highlighting the jetport project, [...] "Environmental scientists have become increasingly aware that, without careful planning, development of a region and the conservation of its natural resources do not go hand in hand". The New York Times called it a [...] "blueprint for disaster", and Wisconsin senator Gaylord Nelson wrote to President Richard Nixon voicing his opposition: [...] "It is a test {{of whether or not}} <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> committed in this country to protecting our environment." [...] Governor Claude Kirk withdrew his support for the project, and the 78-year-old Marjory Stoneman Douglas was persuaded to go on tour to give hundreds of speeches against it. She established Friends of the Everglades and encouraged more than 3,000members to join. Initially the U.S. Department of Transportation pledged funds to support the jetport, but after pressure, Nixon overruled the department. He instead established Big Cypress National Preserve, announcing it in the Special Message to the Congress Outlining the 1972 Environmental Program. Following the jetport proposition, restoration of the Everglades became not only a statewide priority, but an international one as well. In the 1970s the Everglades were declared an International Biosphere Reserve and a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, and a Wetland of International Importance by the Ramsar Convention, making it one of only three locations on earth that have appeared on all three lists.|$|E
500|$|Showrunner and episode writer Steven Moffat {{wanted the}} episode to be [...] "big" [...] {{and say that}} [...] "we are turning {{it up to a}} level, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> going mad with it". Atmospheric {{lighting}} was added by director of photography Stephan Pehrsson, who wanted to give it a movie feel. Moffat chose Stonehenge as the primary location for the episode because the monument was large and important enough to be suitable for the fall of someone as powerful as the Doctor. Filming was done at the real Stonehenge in Wiltshire on the night of 2 February 2010. The cast and crew had to abide by regulations; they were not allowed to touch the stones, bring heavy equipment in, and the lighting had to be done from the floor. They could only afford to shoot during one night and spent the only hour of daylight in the morning shooting a three-minute dialogue sequence. This proved to be a challenge, as it typically took {{an hour and a half}} to film similar scenes. The rest of the scenes set at Stonehenge were filmed with a lightweight replica set up in Margam Country Park called [...] "Foamhenge" [...] over four nights. Director Toby Haynes thought that they had [...] "established" [...] Stonehenge at the real site and now could get away with seeing less of it. The Doctor's speech to the alien spaceships was filmed 3 February, while Rory shooting Amy was shot on 4 February. The weather conditions were very cold with wind and rain which caused difficulties as it was hard to communicate over the wind. Haynes wanted the Doctor's speech to be his [...] "big, pop-star moment" [...] and to look as if he was addressing a large site such as Wembley Stadium.|$|E

2500|$|Although MTV {{reached its}} 30th year of {{broadcasting}} in 2011, the channel itself passed over this milestone {{in favor of}} its current programming schedule. The channel instead aired its 30th anniversary celebrations on its sister networks MTV2 and VH1 Classic. Nathaniel Brown, {{senior vice president of}} communications for MTV, confirmed that there were no plans for an on-air MTV celebration similar to the channel's 20th anniversary. Brown explained, [...] "MTV as a brand doesn't age with our viewers. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> focused on our current viewers, and our feeling was that our anniversary wasn't something that would be meaningful to them, many of whom weren't even alive in 1981." ...|$|E

2500|$|If {{all this}} is true, then where do the world senses come in? The early empiricists all {{stumbled}} over this point. Hume asserted that all knowledge comes from the senses, and then gave away the ballgame by excepting abstract propositions, which he called [...] "relations of ideas". These, he said, were absolutely true (although the mathematicians who thought them up, being human, might get them wrong). Mill, on the other hand, tried to deny that abstract ideas exist outside the physical world: all numbers, he said, [...] "must be numbers of something: {{there are no such}} things as numbers in the abstract". When we count to eight or add five and three <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> counting spoons or bumblebees. [...] "All things possess quantity", he said, so that propositions concerning numbers are propositions concerning [...] "all things whatever". But then in almost a contradiction of himself he went on to acknowledge that numerical and algebraic expressions are not necessarily attached to real world objects: they [...] "do not excite in our minds ideas of any things in particular". Mill's low reputation as a philosopher of logic, and the low estate of empiricism in the century and a half following him, derives from this failed attempt to link abstract thoughts to the physical world, when it may be more plausibly arguable that abstraction consists precisely of separating the thought from its physical foundations.|$|E
2500|$|Templer became GOC of the 1st Infantry Division, {{which had}} come {{under his command}} while he was GOC II Corps, on 31 July 1943. The division, with the 2nd, 3rd Infantry Brigades and the 24th Guards Brigade and {{supporting}} units, was based south of Tunis and had recently fought, with great distinction, in the final phases of the Tunisian Campaign, where it had gained three Victoria Crosses (VC) {{in the space of}} a week. The division was then training for future participation in the Italian Campaign. In late August General Sir Harold Alexander, commanding the Allied 15th Army Group, along with numerous and senior US and British generals, arrived to present the VC to Lance Corporal John Kenneally of the 1st Battalion, Irish Guards. Shortly afterwards, the division was involved in a divisional parade, with General Dwight [...] "Ike" [...] Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in the theatre, reviewing the entire division. Templer himself wrote about the moment, saying [...] "I think it was the proudest moment of my life. In his address Ike said, 'When it gives me, your Supreme Commander and an American general, as proud to see you, the 1st Division of the British Army, on parade today as if you were the 1st Division of the American Army, then <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> getting somewhere!' It was a magnificent parade, and as far as I know, unique". Despite managing to concentrate the division and get it training in mountain warfare, Templer was not destined to lead the 1st Division into battle, although he was later to meet it again in Italy.|$|E
