25|$|The primary {{function}} of the pusdalyvis is to indicate a simultaneous, but secondary action done by the sentence subject in nominative case (it must be matched according to gender and number with the said subject): Lauko darbus mes dirbome dainuodami – We <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> field works while singing. In this case the present padalyvis participle {{can be used as}} well: Lauko darbus mes dirbome dainuojant, but this time the sentence will mean: We <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> field works while someone else was singing. A secondary action done previously by the sentence subject can be expressed with adjectival past simple participle: Lauko darbus mes dirbome padainavę – We <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> field works having sung. When used with the preposition prieš (before), pusdalyvis and padalyvis denote a secondary action in future: Lauko darbus mes dirbome prieš dainuodami. – We <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> field works before singing. Lauko darbus mes dirbome prieš dainuojant. – We <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> field works before someone else started to sing.|$|E

25|$|Australian war artist George Gittoes {{collected}} independent {{interviews with}} soldiers while producing his documentary Soundtrack To War. The war in Iraq provided {{the first time}} in history that military on the front lines were able to provide direct, uncensored reportage themselves, thanks to blogging software and the reach of the internet. Dozens of such reporting sites, known as soldier blogs or milblogs, were started during the war. These blogs were more often than not largely pro-war and stated various reasons why the soldiers and Marines felt they <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> right thing.|$|E
25|$|In the Boeing 787 Dreamliner's {{first year}} of service, at least four {{aircraft}} suffered from electrical system problems stemming from its lithium-ion batteries, resulting in the whole Dreamliner fleet being voluntarily grounded in January 2013.

Japanese authorities announced they <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> same for their airplanes. The NTSB eventually determined that the cause was a fault within one of the cells, and faulted Boeing for not designing it to withstand a short-circuit, and the FAA for not considering the possibility in their certification process.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, President Barack Obama {{signed the}} Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. This law {{extended}} {{the statute of}} limitations on cases where a worker found that they were receiving discriminatory pay, allowing them to sue and receive recompense more than six months after they received the pay. This was seen as a victory for those fighting against the gender wage gap, because if a woman {{at the end of her}} career found that she had been making less money than men who <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> same work, she now had more than six months from the date of her last pay check to file a claim and possibly receive the wages that were denied.|$|E
25|$|On {{election}} day, {{there was}} intimidation and fraud on all sides, employed by both parties. Edgefield and Laurens counties had more votes for Democratic candidate Wade Hampton III {{than the total}} number of registered voters in either county. The returns were disputed all the way to Washington, where they {{played a central role in}} the Compromise of 1877. Both parties claimed victory. For a while, two separate state assemblies did business side by side on the floor of the State House (their Speakers shared the Speaker's desk, but each had his own gavel), until the Democrats moved to their own building. There the Democrats continued to pass resolutions and conducted the state's business, just as the Republicans <b>were</b> <b>doing.</b> <b>The</b> Republican State Assembly tossed out results of the tainted election and reelected Chamberlain as governor. A week later, General Wade Hampton III took the oath of office for the Democrats.|$|E
25|$|Caro's {{depiction}} of Moses's life gives him full credit for his early achievements, showing, for example, how he conceived and created Jones Beach and the New York State Park system, but also shows how Moses's desire for power {{came to be}} more important to him than his earlier dreams. Moses is blamed for having destroyed more than a score of neighborhoods by building 13 expressways across New York City and by building large urban renewal projects with little regard for the urban fabric or for human scale. Yet the author is more neutral in his central premise: the city would have developed much differently without Moses. Other US cities <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> same thing as New York in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s; Boston, San Francisco, and Seattle, for instance, each built highways straight through their downtown areas. The New York City architectural intelligentsia of the 1940s and 1950s, who largely believed in such prophets of the automobile as Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe, had supported Moses. Many other cities, like Newark, Chicago, and St. Louis, also built massive, unattractive public housing projects.|$|E

25|$|The Indian Cricket League's ongoing {{tournament in}} Ahmedabad was canceled. The two {{remaining}} One Day Internationals {{of the seven}} match series between the visiting England cricket team and India were cancelled. The visiting team flew home, but returned to continue the test series. However, the venue of the second India-England test match, scheduled on 19–23 December, was shifted from Mumbai to Chennai. The inaugural Twenty20 Champions League, scheduled from 3 to 10 December, Mumbai {{being one of the}} host cities, was postponed. The attacks have brought into significance the issue of 379 Indian boats and 336 fishermen apprehended by the Pakistan marine agency, for entering their waters. Nearly 200 of the boats have reportedly been auctioned, now recognised as a national security issue for India. On 28 November, Pakistan released 99 fishermen who were apprehended, as part of confidence building measures with India. There were threats to blow up ITC Fortune Hotel in Navi Mumbai, after Mumbai police received a bomb threat from terrorists. Rumours about further shootings at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>the</b> rounds in Mumbai on 28 November, and were widely reported by the news channels.

A coalition of sugarcane growers, named Big Sugar, she accused of polluting Lake Okeechobee by pumping water tainted with chemicals, human waste, and garbage back into the lake, which served as the fresh water source for the Miami metropolitan area. She compared Florida sugarcane agriculture to sugarcane grown in the West Indies, which, she claimed, was more environmentally sound, had a longer harvest cycle less harmful to soil nutrients, and was less expensive for consumers due to the higher sugar content.|$|E
