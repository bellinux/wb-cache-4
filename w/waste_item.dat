Guidelines for WIPP specify that any <b>waste</b> <b>item</b> to be interred must be fully characterized and analyzed to determine the presence of chemical compounds designated hazardous and certain toxic elements. The Transuranic Waste Characterization Program (TWCP) was launched to develop analysis and quality guidelines, certify laboratories, and to oversee the actual waste characterizations at the laboratories. ORNL is participating in the waste characterization phase and brings to bear a variety of analytical techniques including ICP-AES, cold vapor atomic absorption, and instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) to collective determine arsenic, cadmium, barium, chromium, mercury, selenium, silver, and other elements. All of the analytical techniques involved participate in a cooperative effort to meet the project objectives. One important component of any good quality assurance program is determining when an alternate method is more suitable for a given analytical problem.

Ideally, the characterization would be done robotically, and either automatically or semi-automatically in order to improve efficiency and safety. For the FY 94 Mixed Waste Operations (MWO) project, a treatable <b>waste</b> <b>item</b> is defined as a homogeneous metal object that has external radioactive or heavy metal hazardous contamination.

They have demonstrated the efficiency possible by integrating radiographic with tomographic data. Here, they developed a technique to only use radiographic data where the material is homogeneous (fast), and then switching to tomography in those areas where heterogeneity is detected (slower). They also developed a tomographic technique to quantify the volume of each component of a mixed material. This is useful for such things as determining ash content.

40|$|Environmental {{management}} practices {{are common in}} large companies, but rare in small businesses even though, collectively, their environmental footprint is substantially greater. There is, therefore, a crucial need to engage small businesses in practices that reduce their environmental impact and assist sustainability. However, the management of environmental issues in small business is {{the domain of the}} owner-manager who is often resource poor, both financially and in the amount of time available to implement new sustainable practices. A survey of 139 small businesses in a light industrial area has provided an indication of the environmental footprint of small business by showing the volume of waste generated compared to the amount recycled. An intervention programme to increase recycling in this area and reduce the negative impact of these businesses has produced positive results. These results demonstrate that engaging small business in environmental management can be a catalyst both for reducing the environmental impact of small businesses, and for the implementation of local initiatives. Of critical importance in the success of the intervention was direct consultation from the outset with small business owner-managers. This consultation meant that when a barrier to recycling was identified with a particular <b>waste</b> <b>item</b> the owner-manager was provided the opportunity to agree on a solution and cooperate in the efforts to implement beneficial changes. As a consequence of the research and intervention, an increased awareness of waste disposal, recycling issues and opportunities has been created, with improved communication and cooperation between small businesses, recycling contractors and local environmental organisations.

40|$|Compressed gas {{cylinders}} contaminated with radionuclides are a unique <b>waste</b> <b>item</b> that {{may become a}} Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous waste through two mechanisms: either {{the contents of the}} compressed gas cylinder are regulated under RCRA or the internal pressure of the compressed gas cylinder gives it the characteristic of reactivity. The characteristic of reactivity is defined by RCRA in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 261. 23 (a) (6) as a waste that is capable of detonation or explosive reaction if it is subjected to a strong initiating source or heated under confinement. In a letter dated September 1, 1989, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Solid Waste referred the interpretation of the definition of reactivity to the EPA Regional Office and/or the state (if the state has primacy). The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) has made the interpretation that to meet the definition of reactive as specified in 40 CFR 261. 23 (a) (6) there must be a chemical reaction that causes the explosion or detonation. This interpretation limits the compressed {{gas cylinders}} that have to be treated as RCRA hazardous waste to those that have other RCRA characteristic codes or contain listed wastes. The difficulty in treating compressed gas cylinders is heightened in the case of radiologically contaminated compressed gas cylinders because the internal pressure and possible hazardous constituents must be treated in most cases before decontamination of the cylinder is possible. Special procedures must be followed to ensure that radiological contamination is not transferred to clean gas cylinders or released into the environment...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the different approaches}} taken in dealing with waste products and flows in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Emergy Accounting (EMA), from a methodological point of view, and aims to develop more standardized and synergistic procedures. LCA deals with the waste issue {{from the point of}} view of the impact of their disposal, as well as the potential benefit (‘environmental credit’) afforded by the avoided extraction and processing of additional primary resources when waste is recycled or its energy content recovered. The ‘environmental burden’ associated to the entire production and consumption chain leading to the <b>waste</b> <b>item</b> is generally not included in LCAs of waste management systems, due to the boundary being placed – consistently with the intended goal – around the actual disposal processes (including recycling alternatives and associated environmental credits). Instead, Emergy Accounting, a donor-side approach with its implicit boundary set at the biosphere level, in principle keeps track of the entire supply-chain at all times, considering even waste flows as products (or co-products), and calculating their intensity factors and assessing their role within the ecosystem's web and hierarchy. However, when the focus is limited to evaluating processes under human control, within the narrower space and time boundary of human-dominated production and consumption processes, waste products can arguably be regarded as something to be recycled or disposed of to minimize the environmental burden. When this is the case, and particularly in comparative analyses, the emergy perspective thus becomes closer to the LCA perspective and interesting methodological synergies may emerge. A clearly defined set of emergy algebra rules for waste products and flows, and specifically for recycling, was found to be still lacking in the available emergy literature. We propose here that a better and more consistent methodological solution may be arrived at by leveraging the work done in LCA...|$|E

Data for the commodity-by-industry, value added-by-industry, and commodity-by-final demand parts {{were obtained from the}} 2000 Tokyo interregional input–output table (TMG table, hereafter) (TMG 2007). In Japan, for the purposes of waste treatment, waste is categorized into industrial waste and MSW, which can further be categorized into business waste and household waste. The amount of waste generated by industrial sectors and final demand sectors was mainly estimated using statistical data published by Japanese government ministries and agencies (Ministry of Finance 2000; BoE-TMG 2001, 2003; Habara et al. 2002; METI 2002; Ministry of Environment (MOE) of Japan 2003 a, b, 2004; Nakamura 2010; Statistics Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC) of Japan 2000, 2004). In estimating the <b>waste</b> <b>items</b> generated in Tokyo, we also referred to the information contained in the Clean Association of TOKYO 23 (2001). Three environmental load sectors were considered: CO 2 emissions, landfill volume, and landfill area. The CO 2 emission sector was defined based on the 3 EID database (Nansai et al. 2008). Since landfilling is the result of waste treatment activities, the landfill volume and landfill area were grouped with the waste treatment sectors and not with any of the industrial sectors.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is to use industrial wastes rather than natural soil, aggregates, etc. in roads and highway construction after enhancing its strength, stability and durability. Conventionally, soil, stone aggregates, sand, bitumen, cement etc. are used in construction of roads and highway. Characteristic materials being limited in nature and thereby need of alternate materials is necessary. Gigantic quantities of soil are utilized {{as a part of}} the development of street and parkway yet adequate quantity of soil of required quality is not available effectively. To meet this demand extensive deforestation is being done which cause deforestation, soil disintegration and loss of rich soil which hampers in the farming efficiency. Additionally, cost of procurement of suitable quality of material is increasing. Worried about this, the researchers are searching for option materials for thruway development, and modern <b>waste</b> <b>item</b> is one such class. Stabilization method highlighted in this thesis is mainly to enhance the inherent strength of wastes like fly ash and crushed blast furnace slag (CBFS). This will automatically reduce the use of natural soil in addition to mitigate the disposal problems of industrial solid wastes in a great way. Fly ash and blast furnace slag was collected from Rourkela steel plant (RSP). Tests were conducted by blending fly ash and blast furnace slag in different proportions. The compaction characteristics, strength properties and the bearing value of different mixes are determined. From the compaction tests the optimum moisture content and the maximum dry density are determined for respective mixes. The strength parameters that are the unconfined compressive strength and CBR value for different mixes compacted to their respective MDD at OMC are evaluated. Further these mixes are blended with lime varying as 0 %, 2 %, 4 %, and 8 % and the UCS values are determined after a curing period of 0, 7 and 28 days. Similarly, the soaked CBR values of lime stabilized mixes at 0 %, 2 %, 4 %, and 8 % are determined after a curing period of 0 and 28 days. The effect of lime, curing period, fly ash and slag content with the unconfined compressive strength values and California bearing ratio values were studied. From the experimental study, it was observed that with addition of blast furnace slag to fly ash- slag mixes, the MDD increases and thereby decreases its OMC value linearly. It was also observed that the UCS value of the fly ash- slag mixes increases with the addition of slag up to slag content of 80 % and there after the same decreases with further increases in slag content. The mix with 80 % slag shows higher value as compared to 100 % slag in the mix. Similar trend was observed for the CBR value for the fly ash- slag mixes, and it was seen that with increase with the slag content the CBR values also increases. However, for 100 % slag the CBR shows a lesser value. Higher UCS and CBR values were reported at 8 % lime content having a curing period of 28 days. The {{objective of}} the present study is to access the suitability of lime stabilized fly ash- blast furnace slag mixes as a highway construction material. So it is concluded that appropriate blending of fly ash with slag gives a better strength compared to individual materials. Further the desired strength required for different component of road can be achieved by stabilizing the mix with appropriate amount of lime...|$|E

These findings show {{that the proportion of}} industrial waste in other regions is considerably larger than that of Tokyo, and reflects the marked differences that exist in the industrial structure of Tokyo and other regions (MOE 2003 a, b, 2004). As mentioned previously, the main industries in Tokyo are tertiary industries which generate relatively less industrial waste than business waste.|$|R
