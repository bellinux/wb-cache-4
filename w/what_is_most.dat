5|$|The smalltail shark forms large aggregations {{segregated}} by sex, {{with the}} males generally found {{deeper than the}} females. It feeds mainly on bony fishes, including sea catfish, croakers, jacks, and grunts. Shrimp, crabs, and squid are secondary food sources, while adults are also capable of taking young sharpnose sharks (Rhizoprionodon), hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna), and stingrays (Dasyatis). Opportunistic in habits, the dietary composition of this shark generally reflects <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>most</b> available in its environment; off northern Brazil, the most important prey species are the croakers Macrodon ancylodon and Stellifer naso. Juveniles consume {{a wider variety of}} prey than adults. In turn, the smalltail shark may potentially be preyed upon by larger sharks.|$|E
5|$|The blackmouth {{catshark}} is an active, generalist predator that feeds on both bottom-dwelling and free-swimming organisms. Its diet {{is dominated by}} decapods, krill, bony fishes (including lanternfishes, bristlemouths, dragonfishes, and moras), and cephalopods. The most significant prey species generally reflect <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>most</b> available in the environment, for example the shrimps Calocaris macandreae and Pasiphaea multidentata off southern France and the prawns Sergestes arcticus and Sergia robusta off the Iberian Peninsula. Juveniles consume a greater amount and variety of crustaceans than adults, including smaller types such as mysids and hyperiid amphipods. Adults favor relatively large fish prey and {{have been known to}} take other sharks and rays and smaller members of the same species. The importance of cephalopod prey across ages differs between regions. The stomachs of some {{blackmouth catshark}}s have found to contain pieces of animals too large for a single shark to overwhelm, suggesting that it may sometimes attack in groups. Scavenging has been infrequently documented, including of human refuse.|$|E

5|$|<b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>most</b> {{important}} for us, {{out of the}} heathen fancy of a kidnapping man of the moon, which, apart from Scandinavia, was doubtless in vogue all over Teutondom, if not farther, there has evolved itself since a Christian adaptation. They say {{the man in the}} moon is a wood-stealer, who during church time on the holy sabbath committed a trespass in the wood, and was then transported to the moon as a punishment; there he may be seen with the axe on his back and the bundle of brushwood (dornwelle) in his hand. Plainly enough the water-pole of the heathen story has been transformed into the axe's shaft, and the carried pail into the thornbrush; the general idea of theft was retained, but special stress laid on the keeping of the christian holiday; the man suffers punishment not so much for cutting firewood, as because he did it on Sunday.|$|E

25|$|Deeply {{affected}} by his dismissal from the Academy, Eakins' later career focused on portraiture, {{such as his}} 1905 Portrait of Professor William S. Forbes. His steadfast insistence on his own vision of realism, {{in addition to his}} notoriety from his school scandals, combined to hurt his income in later years. Even as he approached these portraits with the skill of a highly trained anatomist, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>most</b> noteworthy is the intense psychological presence of his sitters. However, it was precisely for this reason that his portraits were often rejected by the sitters or their families. As a result, Eakins came to rely on his friends and family members to model for portraits. His portrait of Walt Whitman (1887–1888) was the poet's favorite.|$|E
25|$|The savage, like ourselves, {{feels the}} oppression of his {{impotence}} before the powers of Nature; but having in himself nothing that he respects more than Power, {{he is willing to}} prostrate himself before his gods, without inquiring whether they are worthy of his worship. Pathetic and very terrible is the long history of cruelty and torture, of degradation and human sacrifice, endured in the hope of placating the jealous gods: surely, the trembling believer thinks, when <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>most</b> precious has been freely given, their lust for blood must be appeased, and more will not be required. The religion of Moloch — as such creeds may be generically called — is in essence the cringing submission of the slave, who dare not, even in his heart, allow the thought that his master deserves no adulation. Since the independence of ideals is not yet acknowledged, Power may be freely worshipped, and receive an unlimited respect, despite its wanton infliction of pain.|$|E

50|$|In {{his article}} for The Mennonite {{on the decline}} of Mennonite Publishing House, John Sharp {{suggests}} that its difficulties arose partly from a denominational reorganization in 1971 which saw Scottdale, Pennsylvania replaced as a center of influence within the church. Sharp also describes the deep financial difficulties of the church's publishing, brought about by a confusion over whether the Mennonite Publication Board and Mennonite Publishing House should <b>be</b> publishing <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> profitable or <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> beneficial to the church. Construction of a Mennonite Publishing House warehouse in 1978, {{as well as a}} reliance for funding on debenture notes paid by persons and congregations within the church, saw the church's publications deeply in debt by the 1980s.|$|R

500|$|An {{alternative}} {{explanation for}} the birthday-number effect {{that had to be}} tested is mere exposure. If it were true that the numbers in one's birthday are used disproportionately in one's daily life, then the preference for numbers in one's birthday could simply be a preference for <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>most</b> frequent. Zajonc found in his 1960s and 1980s lab studies that familiarity can strongly influence preference, and coined the term [...] "mere exposure effect". But Kitayama and Karasawa argued that even if people did see numbers from their own birthday more, this would still be negligible in comparison to the overall quantity of numbers they encounter in daily life. This is in line with the argument other researchers have used to rule out mere exposure as an {{explanation for the}} name-letter effect.|$|E

500|$|Dragonlance {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular shared worlds, worlds in which writers other than those that created them place adventures. The first Dragonlance trilogy, Chronicles, {{launched}} the Dungeons & Dragons line of novels, with many of its characters spun off into other novels. Along with Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance is TSR's most popular series of novels. According to The 1990s by Marc Oxoby, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>most</b> notable about the series is that [...] "what may at one time been considered disposable, escapist literature" [...] found [...] "unprecedented popularity" [...] in the 1990s. All of the Dragonlance novels remained in print during the decade, turning Weis and Hickman into literary stars and boosting sales of their non-Dragonlance novels. Although the series was initially published in paperback, its success led to hardcover printings. The hardcover version of Dragons of Summer Flame had an [...] "impressive" [...] first printing of 200,000 books. Every Dragonlance novel by Weis and Hickman since 1995 has been released in hardcover, and some previous novels have been re-released in hardcover collector's editions. Dragonlance made TSR one of the most successful publishers of science fiction and fantasy in the 1990s.|$|E
