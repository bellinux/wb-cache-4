5|$|The team {{tried to}} capture {{the feel of the}} {{original}} game with updated graphics and sounds in the demo. It was to feature ten short interactive scenes from Chrono Trigger. Despite receiving requests from fans, the development team did not intend to create a complete remake of the original game since they <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> necessary resources, and because they thought the result would not have been on par with Square Enix-developed titles. The story of the game was altered slightly to allow for the ten scenes to better flow from one to the other.|$|E
5|$|Bill Johnstona {{left arm}} bowler who could bowl both pace and spinwas not {{initially}} in Bradman's {{plan for the}} First Test at Trent Bridge. However, Bradman changed his mind on the morning when rain was forecast. Johnston was played {{in the hope of}} exploiting a wet wicket; he had previously taken match-winning figures of 10/40 and 11/117 against Yorkshire and Hampshire respectively on rain-affected surfaces. In addition, McCool had been struggling with an injury on his spinning finger, and Bradman was worried McCool <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> endurance required for a five-day Test, which was two days longer than a normal tour match. Johnston's inclusion at the expense of McCool was the only difference between the team for the First Test and those against Worcestershire and the MCC. Johnston subsequently cemented his position by taking nine wickets in the matchthe most among the Australians. Johnson, the only specialist spinner chosen, took 1/85.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{stabilization}} of its outer 8s electron, ununennium's first ionization energy—the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom—is predicted to be 4.53eV, {{higher than those}} of the known alkali metals from potassium onward. This effect is so large that unbiunium (element 121) is predicted to have a lower ionization energy of 4.45eV, so that the alkali metal in period 8 <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> lowest ionization energy in the period, as is true for all previous periods. Ununennium's electron affinity is expected to be far greater than that of caesium and francium; indeed, ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it. Relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the polarizability of ununennium, to 169.7a.u. Indeed, the static dipole polarisability (αD) of ununennium, a quantity for which the impacts of relativity are proportional to the square of the element's atomic number, has been calculated to be small and similar to that of sodium.|$|E

5|$|This article {{chronicles the}} life of Keith Miller, an Australian Test cricketer and Australian rules footballer, from his birth on 28 November 1919 until 20 August 1940, when he left {{civilian}} life and joined the Militia (army reserve) during World War II. Born {{in the town of}} Sunshine on the outskirts of Melbourne, Miller made sport the focal point of his early life. The youngest of four children of Scottish descent, Miller joined his siblings in being inculcated with a love of sport by their father, playing football in winter and cricket in summer. Miller's fatheran engineer and sportsloveremphasised the importance of technique over power; Miller benefited as he was of small stature during his childhood and could not rely on brute strength. Miller yearned to be a horse racing jockey, as he felt that he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> physique to succeed in cricket or football.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his {{period in}} the cabinet, Heffron {{was seen as a}} {{prominent}} and well-performing member of the government, and as such a potential contender for the premiership. The first opportunity for Heffron came in February 1946, when McKell announced to the Labor caucus of his intention to resign before the 1947 election. McKell, with the intention of ensuring Heffron as his successor, remained as an MP even after Prime Minister Joseph Chifley had announced his appointment as Governor-General in order to vote for Heffron. At the ballot on 5 February 1947, Heffron lost by two votes to the Minister for Housing, James McGirr, who was favoured by the more Catholic and conservative caucus members. When McGirr announced his resignation on the grounds of ill health on 1 April 1952, Heffron put himself forward as a candidate to succeed him against, among others, Deputy Premier Joseph Cahill. However, the day before the ballot on 3 April, Heffron had been made aware that he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> numbers in caucus to win against Cahill and consequently made arrangements with Cahill to give the votes of his bloc to Cahill, in exchange for his support to become Deputy Premier. As a result, on 3 April Cahill defeated Attorney General Clarrie Martin 32 votes to 14 to become Premier and Heffron defeated Mines Secretary Joshua Arthur 32 votes to 14 to become Deputy Premier.|$|E

25|$|According to Paul Churchland, Mary {{might be}} {{considered}} to be like a feral child. Feral children have suffered extreme isolation during childhood. Technically when Mary leaves the room, she <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> ability to see or know what the color red is. A brain has to learn and develop how to see colors. Patterns need to form in the V4 section of the visual cortex. These patterns are formed from exposure to wavelengths of light. This exposure is needed during the early stages of brain development. In Mary's case, the identifications and categorizations of color will only be in respect to representations of black and white.|$|E
25|$|In a {{paradoxical}} turn of events, the United States government recognized cantors {{as the first}} Jewish clergy, even before rabbis were recognized: as a congregation could be organized and led by a committee of Jewish laypersons, who <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> expertise in liturgy a hazzan would have, newly forming congregations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries sometimes hired a hazzan for a synagogue (and made sure that a kosher butcher {{was established in the}} neighborhood) for some time before setting about hiring a rabbi, seeing the hazzan (and the butcher) as a more immediate need. The hazzan therefore solemnized marriages and otherwise represented the congregation in the eyes of civil authorities.|$|E

As it happened, DEC's Western Software Laboratory found itself between projects with an experienced team. Smokey Wallace of DEC WSL and Jim Gettys proposed that DEC WSL build X11 and make it freely available under the same terms as X9 and X10. This process started in May 1986, with the protocol finalized in August. Alpha testing of the software started in February 1987, beta-testing in May; the release of X11 finally occurred on 15 September 1987.|$|E
25|$|The English Springer Spaniel is a {{medium-sized}} compact dog. Its coat is moderately long with feathering on {{the legs and}} tail. It is a well proportioned, balanced dog with a gentle expression and a friendly wagging tail. This breed represents perhaps the greatest divergence between working and show lines of any breed of dog. A field-bred dog and a show-bred dog appear to be different breeds, but are registered together. In fact, the gene pools are almost completely segregated and have been for at least 70 years. A field-bred dog would not be competitive in a modern dog show, while a show dog <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> speed or stamina to succeed in a field trial.|$|E
25|$|Mimamsas {{argued that}} {{there was no need to}} {{postulate}} a maker for the world, just as there was no need for an author to compose the Vedas or a God to validate the rituals. They further thought that the Gods named in the Vedas had no physical existence apart from the mantras that speak their names. In this regard, the power of the mantras was what was seen as the power of Gods. Mimamsas reasoned that an incorporeal God could not author the Vedas, for he <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> organs of speech to utter words. An embodied God could not author the Vedas either because such a God would be subject to the natural limitations of sensory knowledge and therefore, would not be able to produce supernatural revelations like the Vedas.|$|E
