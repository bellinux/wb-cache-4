25|$|Soap pellets are {{combined}} with fragrances {{and other materials}} and blended to homogeneity in an amalgamator (mixer). The mass is then discharged from the mixer into a refiner, which, {{by means of an}} auger, forces the soap through a fine <b>wire</b> <b>screen.</b> From the refiner, the soap passes over a roller mill (French milling or hard milling) {{in a manner similar to}} calendering paper or plastic or to making chocolate liquor. The soap is then passed through one or more additional refiners to further plasticize the soap mass. Immediately before extrusion, the mass is passed through a vacuum chamber to remove any trapped air. It is then extruded into a long log or blank, cut to convenient lengths, passed through a metal detector, and then stamped into shape in refrigerated tools. The pressed bars are packaged in many ways.|$|E
25|$|Wood-burners emit large {{quantities}} of flying sparks which necessitate an efficient spark-arresting device generally housed in the smokestack. Many different types were fitted, the most common early type being the Bonnet stack that incorporated a cone-shaped deflector placed before {{the mouth of the}} chimney pipe, and a <b>wire</b> <b>screen</b> covering the wide stack exit. A more-efficient design was the Radley and Hunter centrifugal stack patented in 1850 (commonly known as the diamond stack), incorporating baffles so oriented as to induce a swirl effect in the chamber that encouraged the embers to burn out and fall to the bottom as ash. In the self-cleaning smokebox the opposite effect was achieved: by allowing the flue gasses to strike a series of deflector plates, angled {{in such a way that}} the blast was not impaired, the larger particles were broken into small pieces that would be ejected with the blast, rather than settle in the bottom of the smokebox to be removed by hand at the end of the run. As with the arrestor, a screen was incorporated to retain any large embers.|$|E
2500|$|The cotton gin is {{a machine}} that {{separates}} cotton fibers from seedpods and sometimes sticky seeds, a job previously done by hand. These seeds are either used again to grow more cotton or, if badly damaged, disposed of. The cotton gin uses {{a combination of a}} <b>wire</b> <b>screen</b> and small wire hooks to pull the cotton through the screen, while brushes continuously remove the loose cotton lint to prevent jams. In 1793, Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin and later received a patent on March 14, 1794. Whitney's cotton gin could have possibly ignited a revolution in the cotton industry and the rise of [...] "King Cotton" [...] as the main cash crop in the South. However, it never made him rich. Instead of buying his machine, farmers built inferior versions of their own which led to the increasing need for African-American slave labor.|$|E

2500|$|No {{one in the}} Phillies clubhouse {{knew who}} would pitch {{the final game of}} the season against the Dodgers, except Sawyer, until an hour before the game, when the manager handed Roberts the ball. Opposing Roberts was Newcombe, who had opened the season against the Phillies in their 9–1 victory. Roberts walked a batter {{in the bottom of the}} first inning, but no other runners reached base for Brooklyn until the fourth inning. The Phillies had four baserunners on three singles and a walk against Newcombe, but no one {{advanced}} beyond first base. In the bottom of the fourth, Pee Wee Reese hit a double for the Dodgers, but Roberts retired the next three batters in order. In the sixth inning, Sisler was on base, having hit a single through the gap into right field between first baseman Gil Hodges and second baseman Jackie Robinson. Jones singled to left field, driving him in for the first run of the game; his hit has been called [...] "the most important in Phillies history to that point". The Dodgers tied the game on a home run by Reese in the bottom of the sixth; the ball landed on a ledge in right-center field and, caught by a <b>wire</b> <b>screen</b> along the foul line, stayed in play but out of Del Ennis' reach.|$|E

There were no more flashes, and the shadow had become long and stationary; and I remembered their set boyish faces when they clung to the roots in the deep coolness of the pool.|$|E

6000|$|By {{this time}} the {{sunshine}} was pouring in through the screening and across the bed. On {{the outside of the}} <b>wire</b> <b>screen</b> clung a number of house-flies, early-hatched for the season and numb with the night's cold. As Forrest ate he watched the hunting of the meat-eating yellow- jackets. Sturdy, more frost-resistant than bees, they were already on the wing and preying on the benumbed flies. Despite the rowdy noise of their flight, these yellow hunters of the air, with rarely ever a miss, pounced on their helpless victims and sailed away with them. The last fly was gone ere Forrest had sipped his last sip of coffee, marked [...] "Commercial Breeding of Frogs" [...] with a match, and taken up his proofsheets.|$|E
6000|$|There it was again: {{discontent with}} the good common ways. Babbitt laid down the book {{and listened to the}} stillness. The inner doors of the house were open. He heard from the kitchen the steady drip of the refrigerator, a rhythm {{demanding}} and disquieting. He roamed to the window. The summer evening was foggy and, seen through the <b>wire</b> <b>screen,</b> the street lamps were crosses of pale fire. The whole world was abnormal. While he brooded, Verona and Ted came in and went up to bed. Silence thickened in the sleeping house. He put on his hat, his respectable derby, lighted a cigar, and walked up and down before the house, a portly, worthy, unimaginative figure, humming [...] "Silver Threads among the Gold." [...] He casually considered, [...] "Might call up Paul." [...] Then he remembered. He saw Paul in a jailbird's uniform, but while he agonized he didn't believe the tale. It was part of the unreality of this fog-enchanted evening.|$|E
6000|$|I {{had already}} learned how hard and long and dismal a task {{it is to}} burrow down into {{the bowels of the}} earth and get out the coveted ore; and now I learned that the {{burrowing}} was only half the work; and that to get the silver out of the ore was the dreary and laborious other half of it. We had to turn out at six in the morning and keep at it till dark. This mill was a six-stamp affair, driven by steam. Six tall, upright rods of iron, as large as a man's ankle, and heavily shod with a mass of iron and steel at their lower ends, were framed together like a gate, and these rose and fell, one after the other, in a ponderous dance, in an iron box called a [...] "battery." [...] Each of these rods or stamps weighed six hundred pounds. One of us stood by the battery all day long, breaking up masses of silver-bearing rock with a sledge and shoveling it into the battery. The ceaseless dance of the stamps pulverized the rock to powder, and a stream of water that trickled into the battery turned it to a creamy paste. The minutest particles were driven through a fine <b>wire</b> <b>screen</b> which fitted close around the battery, and were washed into great tubs warmed by super-heated steam--amalgamating pans, they are called. The mass of pulp in the pans was kept constantly stirred up by revolving [...] "mullers." [...] A quantity of quicksilver was kept always in the battery, and this seized some of the liberated gold and silver particles and held on to them; quicksilver was shaken in a fine shower into the pans, also, about every half hour, through a buckskin sack. Quantities of coarse salt and sulphate of copper were added, {{from time to time to}} assist the amalgamation by destroying base metals which coated the gold and silver and would not let it unite with the quicksilver.|$|E

6000|$|All these {{tiresome}} {{things we}} had to attend to constantly. Streams of dirty water flowed always from the pans and were carried off in broad wooden troughs to the ravine. One would not suppose that atoms of gold and silver would float on top of six inches of water, but they did; {{and in order to}} catch them, coarse blankets were laid in the troughs, and little obstructing [...] "riffles" [...] charged with quicksilver were placed here and there across the troughs also. These riffles had to be cleaned and the blankets washed out every evening, to get their precious accumulations--and after all this eternity of trouble one third of the silver and gold in a ton of rock would find its way {{to the end of the}} troughs in the ravine at last and have to be worked over again some day. There is nothing so aggravating as silver milling. There never was any idle time in that mill. There was always something to do. It is a pity that Adam could not have gone straight out of Eden into a quartz mill, in order to understand the full force of his doom to [...] "earn his bread by the sweat of his brow." [...] Every now and then, during the day, {{we had to}} scoop some pulp out of the pans, and tediously [...] "wash" [...] it in a horn spoon--wash it little by little over the edge till at last nothing was left but some little dull globules of quicksilver in the bottom. If they were soft and yielding, the pan needed some salt or some sulphate of copper or some other chemical rubbish to assist digestion; if they were crisp to the touch and would retain a dint, they were freighted with all the silver and gold they could seize and hold, and consequently the pan needed a fresh charge of quicksilver. When there was nothing else to do, one could always [...] "screen tailings." [...] That is to say, he could shovel up the dried sand that had washed down to the ravine through the troughs and dash it against an upright <b>wire</b> <b>screen</b> to free it from pebbles and prepare it for working over.|$|E

500|$|As {{initially}} constructed, {{the interior}} was relatively open with two-rail handrails, {{but a couple of}} suicides and an accidental fall prompted the addition of tall <b>wire</b> <b>screening</b> ( [...] high with a large diamond mesh) on the inside edge of the stairs and landings in 1929. The original steam powered elevator, which took 10 to 12 minutes to ascend to the observation floor, was replaced by an electric elevator powered by an on-site dynamo in 1901 which took five minutes to ascend. The monument was connected to the electrical grid in 1923, allowing the installation of a modern electric elevator in 1925–26 which took 70 seconds.

50|$|The {{simplest}} sizing {{process is}} screening, or passing the particles to be sized through a screen or number of screens. Screening equipment can include grizzlies, bar <b>screens,</b> wedge <b>wire</b> <b>screens,</b> radial sieves, banana screens, multi-deck screens, vibratory screen, fine screens, flip flop <b>screens</b> and <b>wire</b> mesh <b>screens.</b> Screens can be static (typically {{the case for}} very coarse material), or they can incorporate mechanisms to shake or vibrate the screen. Some considerations in this process include the screen material, the aperture size, shape and orientation, the amount of near sized particles, the addition of water, the amplitude and frequency of the vibrations, the angle of inclination, the presence of harmful materials, like steel and wood, and the size distribution of the particles.|$|R
50|$|The {{most popular}} design was a bonnet chimney. The bonnet was a funnel-shaped sheet metal cone fitted over a {{conventional}} cylindrical chimney. The lower, small-diameter {{portion of the}} cone served as a collection hopper for falling embers. The upper portion of the cone concealed an inner cone {{at the top of}} the cylindrical chimney which deflected escaping steam, smoke and embers outward against the inner walls of the outer cone. The heavier embers were expected to fall into the hopper below while the lighter steam and smoke passed upward through a <b>wire</b> <b>screen</b> over the upper, large-diameter end of the outer cone. Deflection of the embers typically lengthened screen life to three or four weeks. Some of these chimneys had provisions dropping collected embers into a portion of the smokebox called the subtreasury. Sophisticated designs like the Radley & Hunter included various centrifugal separation baffles into the bonnet. As coal replaced wood fuel, the bonnet was reduced into a simple diamond stack housing the inner deflecting cone (with or without the upper <b>wire</b> <b>screen)</b> but without any collection hopper.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims at {{evaluating}} three selected low-cost {{porous materials}} {{from the point of}} view of their suitability as regenerator materials in the design of thermoacoustic travelling wave engines. The materials tested include: a cellular ceramic substrate with regular square channels; steel “scourers”; and stainless steel “wool”. Comparisons are made against a widely used regenerator material: stainless steel woven <b>wire</b> mesh <b>screen.</b> For meaningful comparisons, the materials are selected to have similar hydraulic radii. One set of regenerators was designed around the hydraulic radius of 200 μm. This included the ceramic substrate, steel “scourers”, stainless steel “wool” and stacked <b>wire</b> <b>screens</b> (as a reference). This set was complemented by steel “scourers” and stacked <b>wire</b> <b>screens</b> (as a reference) with hydraulic radii of 120 μm. Therefore six regenerators were produced to carry out the testing. Initial tests were made in a steady air flow to estimate their relative pressure drop due to viscous dissipation. Subsequently, they were installed in a looped-tube travelling-wave thermoacoustic engine to test their relative performance. Testing included the onset temperature difference, the maximum pressure amplitude generated and the acoustic power output as a function of mean pressure between 0 and 10 bar above atmospheric. It appears that the performance of regenerators made out of “scourers” and steel “wool” is much worse than their mesh-screen counterparts of the same hydraulic radius. However cellular ceramics may offer an alternative to traditional regenerator materials to reduce the overall system costs. Detailed discussions are provided...|$|R
