5|$|Dependent stage – At this stage, {{symptoms}} {{build up}} gradually. Hangover symptoms from excessive drinking may {{be confused with}} withdrawal symptoms. Many addicts will maintain their drinking to avoid withdrawal sickness, drinking small amounts frequently. They <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> hide their drinking problem from others and will avoid gross intoxication.|$|E
5|$|This {{explains}} {{the most natural}} plans for both sides. White will try a minority attack on the queenside, {{in order to increase}} its space advantage and to create some weaknesses in the black pawns (e.g. an isolated pawn or a backward pawn). So White <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> use the advances b2–b4 or c4–c5 in good conditions, supported by the queen and the rooks on the c-file and the d-file. On the other hand, Black <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> keep the position closed, most importantly by keeping the c4-pawn where it is {{in order to keep the}} Bf1 at bay. This can be achieved by moves like b7–b6 and d7–d6, and sometimes the manoeuvre Ne5–d7–f8–e6. The first move by Black has to be 10...d6! because otherwise White plays 11.c5! and gets a clear advantage immediately. For example 10...b6? loses a pawn to 11.Qd5 Nc6 12.Bxc7, and 10...0-0?! is bad because of 11.c5! Qxc5? 12.Rc1 Qe7 13.Rxc7 and White is winning already.|$|E

Hardie, {{who was in a}} bookmakers {{at the time of the}} call, suggests that Bulloch and Paul Savage continue mixing the song, and says he <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> contact Braithwaite. This ends at (7:04), leaving the sound of ambient guitar noise to fade out and end the song.|$|E

5|$|Impala feed on {{soft and}} nutritious grasses such as Digitaria macroblephara; tough, tall grasses, such as Heteropogon contortus and Themeda triandra, are {{typically}} avoided. Impala {{on the periphery}} of the herds are generally more vigilant against predators than those feeding in the centre; a foraging individual <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> defend the patch it is feeding on by lowering its head. A study revealed that time spent in foraging reaches a maximum of 75.5% of the day in the late dry season, decreases through the rainy season, and is minimal in the early dry season (57.8%).|$|E
5|$|The Modern Benoni {{is one of}} Black's sharpest {{and most}} active defences against 1.d4. The {{exchange}} of White's c-pawn for Black's e-pawn leaves White with a pawn majority in the centre and Black with one on the queenside. This asymmetry suggests that White <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> play on the kingside and in the centre, while Black will seek counterplay on the queenside. However, this simplistic generalization does not hold in many cases—depending on how the pieces are arranged, either side {{may be able to}} fight back on the flank where they are theoretically weaker.|$|E
5|$|Visual {{displays}} mostly {{occur in}} agonistic situations. Elephants <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> appear more threatening by raising {{their heads and}} spreading their ears. They may add to the display by shaking their heads and snapping their ears, as well as throwing dust and vegetation. They are usually bluffing when performing these actions. Excited elephants may raise their trunks. Submissive ones will lower their heads and trunks, as well as flatten their ears against their necks, while those that accept a challenge will position their ears in a V shape.|$|E

5|$|Adult elk usually stay in single-sex {{groups for}} most of the year. During the mating period known as the rut, mature bulls compete for the attentions of the cow elk and <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> defend females in their harem. Rival bulls {{challenge}} opponents by bellowing and by paralleling each other, walking back and forth. This allows potential combatants to assess the other's antlers, body size and fighting prowess. If neither bull backs down, they engage in antler wrestling, and bulls sometimes sustain serious injuries. Bulls also dig holes in the ground, in which they urinate and roll their body. A male elk's urethra points upward so that urine is sprayed almost at a right angle to the penis. The urine soaks into their hair and gives them a distinct smell which attracts cows.|$|E

On {{top of his}} own infidelity, Will feels insecure because of the love between Sonny and Paul, and because Will thinks he is inferior to Paul because of Paul's success and athleticism. Will's infidelity with Paul is not initially common knowledge; Adrienne slaps Will when she learns of it, and a tabloid later publicizes the affair. Paul's mother, Tori, comes to Salem. Will discovers that Tori once had a connection to Salem and the DiMera family - a connection that she keeps secret from Paul. Using this information, <b>Will</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> blackmail Tori into getting Paul out of Salem and drafts an article identifying Paul as a DiMera.

Will and Sonny enter marriage counseling, but <b>Will</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> influence their therapist by secretly offering to publish a flattering profile of him. <b>Will</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> set Paul up with Derrick; the plan succeeds until Paul realizes Will has given Derrick private information he learned in their interview. In light of Will's continued deceptions, {{as well as his}} revelation that he also cheated on Sonny with a man in LA, Sonny decides to take a job at Titan's Paris office. In Sonny's absence, Will's interactions with Paul are tense. Gabi is released from prison, and Will and Arianna welcome her back into their lives.|$|R

5|$|If a P. schultzi female is mature, a male P. schultzi <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> copulate with her, or cohabit with a subadult {{female and}} copulate {{while she is}} moulting. They usually mate on a web or on a {{dragline}} made by the female, and P. schultzi typically copulates for about 100seconds, while others in the genus can take several minutes or even several hours. Females try to kill and eat their mates during or after copulation, and subadult females mimic adult females to attract males as prey. Contests between Portia females are violent, and embraces in P. schultzi typically take 20 to 60seconds. Sometimes, one female knocks the other {{on her back and}} the other may be killed and eaten if she does not right herself quickly and run way. When hunting, P. schultzi mature females emit olfactory signals that reduce the risk that any other females, males, or juveniles of the same species may contend for the same prey.|$|E

5|$|In the game's single-player mode, {{the player}} must {{complete}} {{a series of}} levels where different types of AI-controlled enemies <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> hinder the player's progress. The game primarily takes place inside labyrinthine underground facilities, but the player can occasionally travel {{over the surface of}} the planets where the facilities are buried to reach other nearby areas. The underground facilities are composed of a set of tunnels and rooms separated by doors. Most of them can be opened by either firing weapons at them or bumping into them, but others require special actions to be performed first before entry is allowed. For instance, some doors require special keys to open them. To finish a level and proceed to the next one, the player must complete a certain set of objectives, ranging from collecting items to activating switches, defeating enemies, and destroying objects, among others. Some levels also feature optional objectives that are not critical but add to the player's overall completion score.|$|E
5|$|Lek {{systems are}} known to exist among some populations of walruses. These males cluster around females and try to attract them with {{elaborate}} courtship displays and vocalizations. Lekking may also exist among California sea lions, South American fur seals, New Zealand sea lions and harbor seals. In some species, including elephant seals and grey seals, males <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> lay claim to the desired females and defend them from rivals. Elephant seal males establish dominance hierarchies with the highest ranking males—the alpha males—maintaining harems {{of as many as}} 30–100 females. These males commonly disrupt the copulations of their subordinates while they themselves can mount without inference. They will, however, break off mating to chase off a rival. Grey seal males usually claim a location among a cluster of females whose members may change over time. Male harp seals, crabeater seals and hooded seals follow and defend lactating females in their vicinity—usually one or two at a time,—and wait for them to reach estrus.|$|E
