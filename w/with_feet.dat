5|$|Stela 10 {{was found}} in Group 21 {{together}} with Altar 6. They are among the very few monuments that were placed outside of the ceremonial centre of the city. Stela 10 was carved with a frame containing a figure, now badly eroded. The figure is standing <b>with</b> <b>feet</b> separated and turned outwards. Small hieroglyphic panels accompany it. Stela 10 had been moved from its original location, which was probably somewhere nearby.|$|E
5|$|Foundation: For {{every square}} chi, apply two dan of earth; {{on top of}} it lay a mixture of broken brick, tile and crushed stones, also two dan. For every five-cun layer of earth, two men, {{standing}} face to face, should tamp six times with pestles, each man pounding three times on a dent; then tamp four times on each dent, two men again standing face to face, each pounding twice on the same dent; then tamp two more times, each man pounding once. Following this, tamp the surface with pestles or stamp <b>with</b> <b>feet</b> randomly to even out the surface. Every five-cun layer of earth should be compressed to three cun; every three-cun layer of brick and stone to one and a half cun.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate the effect of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor on neutrophil functions in diabetic patients <b>with</b> active <b>foot</b> infections in vitro. Twelve diabetic patients <b>with</b> <b>foot</b> infections and 12 normal volunteers were enrolled. Neutrophils from peripheral blood were incubated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, 50 ng/mL) for 20 min. Superoxide production of neutrophils {{was measured by the}} reduction of ferricytochrome C. Neutrophil phagocytosis was assayed using Staphylococcus aureus and the weighted phagocytic index was calculated. Superoxide production of neutrophils in diabetic patients <b>with</b> <b>foot</b> infections was 7. 7 (unit: nmol/ 2 x 10 (5) cells/ 60 min), which was significantly lower than that in controls (12. 0) (p< 0. 05). G-CSF increased neutrophil superoxide production to 12. 1 in diabetic patients <b>with</b> <b>foot</b> infections and to 19. 8 in controls (p< 0. 05 for each). Weighted phagocytic index in diabetic patients <b>with</b> <b>foot</b> infections was 0. 77, which was not significantly {{different from that of the}} controls (0. 69). Weighted phagocytic index was increased significantly by G-CSF to 0. 88 in diabetic patients <b>with</b> <b>foot</b> infections and to 0. 79 in controls (p< 0. 05 for each). In conclusion, G-CSF significantly enhanced neutrophil functions in diabetic patients <b>with</b> <b>foot</b> infections in vitro...|$|R

25|$|Most of {{the great}} Angkor ruins have vast {{displays}} of bas-relief depicting the various gods, goddesses, and other-worldly beings from the mythological stories and epic poems of ancient Hinduism (modified by centuries of Buddhism). Mingled with these images are actual known animals, like elephants, snakes, fish, and monkeys, in addition to dragon-like creatures that look like the stylized, elongated serpents (<b>with</b> <b>feet</b> and claws) found in Chinese art.|$|E
25|$|The labyrintodonts {{have their}} {{origin in the}} early middle Devonian (398-392 Mya) or {{possibly}} earlier. They evolved from a bony fish group: the fleshy-finned Rhipidistia. The only other living group of Rhipidistans alive today are the lungfish, the sister group of the landliving vertebrates. Earliest traces of the land-living forms are fossil trackways from Zache≈Çmie quarry, Poland, dated to 395 million years ago, attributed to an animal <b>with</b> <b>feet</b> very similar to Ichthyostega.|$|E

25|$|Both steppe {{and forest}} species are territorial, though {{territoriality}} varies between species from being characteristic {{only during the}} breeding season, to being territorial throughout the year. When defending their territories from conspecifics, tinamous are highly vocal, creating a cacophony of sound. When an intruder is noticed, birds {{of the same sex}} will confront it. This may lead to conflict, <b>with</b> <b>feet</b> and wings being used in attack. Both males and females will defend their territories; however, in each species only one sex is fiercely territorial.|$|E
25|$|The Kushans {{sponsored}} Buddhism {{together with}} other Iranian and Hindu faiths, and probably contributed to the flourishing of Greco-Buddhist art. Their coins, however, suggest a lack of artistic sophistication: the representations of their kings, such as Kanishka, tend to be crude (lack of proportion, rough drawing), {{and the image of}} the Buddha is an assemblage of a Hellenistic Buddha statue <b>with</b> <b>feet</b> grossly represented and spread apart in the same fashion as the Kushan king. This tends to indicate the anteriority of the Hellenistic Greco-Buddhist statues, used as models, and a subsequent corruption by Kushan artists.|$|E
25|$|Implied {{evidence}} for this comes mainly from two sources, namely, the Bible (in order to cause the victim to die faster, his legs were broken so they could not support his weight and he would suffocate) and iconography (all early depictions of the crucifixion show this arrangement, not the later <b>with</b> <b>feet</b> on top with single nail). It has also been pointed out by some experts that the nailed hands of a body crucified in the manner often shown in modern secular art would not support {{the weight of the}} body and would tear through. A platform for the feet would relieve this problem.|$|E

25|$|Greek chariots {{were made}} to be drawn by two horses {{attached}} to a central pole. If two additional horses were added, they were attached {{on each side of}} the main pair by a single bar or trace fastened to the front or prow of the chariot, as may be seen on two prize vases in the British Museum from the Panathenaic Games at Athens, Greece, in which the driver is seated <b>with</b> <b>feet</b> resting on a board hanging down in front close to the legs of the horses. The biga itself consists of a seat resting on the axle, with a rail at each side to protect the driver from the wheels. Greek chariots appear to have lacked any other attachment for the horses, which would have made turning difficult.|$|E
25|$|When the Sioux {{people lived}} around the Great Lakes, they {{imagined}} their mythical Water Monster Unktehi {{as a large}} aquatic buffalo-like mammal. This image was likely derived from early observations of large Pleistocene mammal fossils such as mammoths and mastodons eroding out of the banks of local lakes and rivers. As some groups of Sioux began moving west into the regions that includes Montana their depictions of Unktehi tended to converge {{on the characteristics of}} local fossils. Although Unktehi continued to be described as horned, it gradually became imagined as reptilian rather than the mammalian portrayals of the Sioux in the Great Lakes region, like the dinosaurs and mosasaurs of the region's Mesozoic rock. Unktehi was described as a snakelike monster equipped <b>with</b> <b>feet,</b> like the elongate sinuous mosasaurs who had four short limbs. Its back was described as ridged and saw-like, a configuration similar to the appearance of a fossil vertebral column eroding from rock.|$|E

Hammond was a WASP, so relaxed during recording sessions that he sat <b>with</b> <b>feet</b> up, reading The New Yorker.

The Guardian called it [...] "very easy to master {{once you have}} {{become familiar with the}} under-thigh handlebar steering and the semi-recumbent driving position <b>with</b> <b>feet</b> on bicycle-type pedals." [...] The Daily Mirror described the arrangement as [...] "surprisingly easy" [...] to master, although it cautioned that [...] "on full speed and on full lock it's very easy to tip it onto two wheels."

500|$|The Mahamuni Buddha {{image is}} housed in a [...] small chamber, seated on a throne in a divine posture known as the Bhumisparsa Mudra. This posture or mudra symbolises Buddha's vanquishing of Mara). The legs are crossed <b>with</b> <b>feet</b> turned inwards, and the right hand touches the ground ritualistically, as a witness of his past deeds. The image is cast in bronze and weighs 6.5 tonnes and is erected on a [...] high {{pedestal}} and reaches a height [...] of [...] Its shoulders measure [...] and its waist measures [...] It is draped in royal costumes with [...] "Brahmanic cords (salwe) and regalia crossing his chest". The image is crowned, bejewelled with diamonds, rubies and sapphires. The left hand appears imprecise, unusually large, and is seen resting in the lap with an upturned palm.|$|E
500|$|According to Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall, Murdoch told Captain Smith {{that he was}} {{attempting}} to [...] "hard-a-port around [...] ", suggesting that he {{was attempting}} a [...] "port around" [...] manoeuvre‚Äì to first swing the bow around the obstacle, then swing the stern so that {{both ends of the}} ship would avoid a collision. There was a delay before either order went into effect; the steam-powered steering mechanism took up to 30seconds to turn the ship's tiller, and the complex task of setting the engines into reverse would also have taken some time to accomplish. Because the centre turbine could not be reversed, both it and the centre propeller, positioned {{directly in front of the}} ship's rudder, were simply stopped. This reduced the rudder's effectiveness, therefore impairing the turning ability of the ship. Had Murdoch simply turned the ship while maintaining her forward speed, Titanic might have missed the iceberg <b>with</b> <b>feet</b> to spare.|$|E
