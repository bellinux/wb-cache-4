5|$|In 1909, Forbes Field's opening season, the Pirates {{beat the}} Detroit Tigers in the World Series. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> meeting of {{eventual}} Hall of Famers Honus Wagner and Ty Cobb.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began on}} October 10, 1888. The Big Four Bridge <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> Louisville bridge with serious {{accidents}} during its building; thirty-seven individuals died during its construction. The first twelve died {{while working on}} a pier foundation when a caisson {{that was supposed to}} hold back the river water flooded, drowning the workers. Another four men died a few months after that when a wooden beam broke while working on a different pier caisson.|$|E
5|$|Gerardo Mazzetta {{and colleagues}} (1998) {{propose that the}} horns might also {{have been used to}} injure or kill small prey. Though horn cores are blunt, they may have had a similar form to modern bovid horns if there was a keratinous covering. However, this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> {{reported}} example of horns being used as hunting weapons in animals.|$|E
25|$|This <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Rams’ <b>only</b> {{victory of}} <b>the</b> season, {{preventing}} them from duplicating the Lions’ dubious accomplishment of the previous season.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> Xtra <b>is</b> {{notable for}} being the first DAP to support RealNetworks's Helix DRM, but through a {{tailored}} firmware. The SanDisk Sansa e200R <b>would</b> later <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> other player to have this feature.|$|R
25|$|As {{it would}} turn out, this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Patriots <b>only</b> playoff loss at Foxboro Stadium. They would not lose another home playoff game again until 31 years later, seven years after Gillette Stadium opened.|$|R
5|$|In a {{controversial}} move, WMATA announced that {{as part of}} a new cashless parking payment system, SmarTrip <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> way to pay for parking at Metro-operated garages and lots effective June 28, 2004, after reports of widespread theft by Metro's parking contractor, Penn Parking.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} election, Blackburn {{defeated}} Evans {{by a vote}} of 125,790 (56%) to 81,882 (36%), the largest Democratic margin of victory in a decade. Greenback Party candidate C. W. Cook garnered 18,954 votes, approximately 8 percent of the total votes cast. These votes came mainly at the expense of Blackburn and the Democrats. Until the election of Ernie Fletcher in 2003, Blackburn <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> physician elected governor of Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Takalik Abaj Monument23 {{dates to}} the Middle Preclassic period, and is found in Takalik Abaj, an {{important}} city {{in the foothills of}} the Guatemalan Pacific coast, in the modern department of Retalhuleu. It appears to be an Olmec-style colossal head re-carved into a niche figure sculpture. If originally a colossal head then it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> known example from outside the Olmec heartland.|$|E
50|$|Although {{they had}} {{performed}} {{a great deal}} the previous year, the five-week European tour <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> band's <b>only</b> live appearances in 1972 {{and they would not}} tour again until October 1973 after recording Quadrophenia.|$|R
50|$|As {{it would}} turn out, this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Patriots <b>only</b> playoff loss at Foxboro Stadium. They would not lose another home playoff game again until 31 years later, seven years after Gillette Stadium opened.|$|R
50|$|Desert racing, {{and track}} racing <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> events <b>the</b> 450r would race in. The 450r would also {{compete in the}} Grand National Cross Country series {{although}} Honda would not sponsor any riders.|$|R
5|$|A Roy of the Rovers {{computer}} game was released, on the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum in 1988. It was {{split into two}} parts: the first an adventure game, in which– taking the role of Roy Race– the player had to find and rescue the kidnapped Melchester team, before then playing the second part, which consisted of a charity match {{to raise funds for}} the club. The fewer players recovered before the match began, then the smaller the team who could take part. In the extreme, Roy <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> player for Melchester. The game received mixed reactions; the Spectrum version received 7/10 from Your Sinclair, but only 3/10 from Sinclair User.|$|E
5|$|As Vandygriff and his {{men began}} pulling back from the mountain, North Korean fire was falling in the platoon area from nearly all directions. The squad leaders started {{to break up the}} weapons that the platoon could not take out with them. At this time they {{discovered}} Brown was dead. Vandygriff told his troops not to remove the identification tags from the dead they would be leaving behind, as the tags <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> means of identification later. Vandygriff put his platoon in a V formation and led them off the hill by the same trail they had ascended, picking up four wounded men on the way down.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the second half, the Terrapins kicked off to the Seminoles before both teams traded field goals. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> points Maryland would muster all night. In the fourth quarter, Florida State added another field goal. On the next possession, Maryland running back Da'Rel Scott and receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey both made short runs for a first down. Scott lost his second fumble of the night on the Terrapin 43-yard line. Florida State took over and scored another touchdown. After Maryland went three-and-out, Seminoles kicker Graham Gano made his third field goal of the night.|$|E
50|$|Boggs was a Republican {{candidate}} for the U.S. Congress in 2002, running against Shelley Berkley in Nevada's First Congressional District. She lost, had she won she <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> Republican African-American female in the House.|$|R
2500|$|Cricket was {{originally}} scheduled to <b>be</b> included in <b>the</b> inaugural 1896 Summer Olympics, which {{were held in}} Athens; cricket <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> team sport held at <b>the</b> Games. There <b>were,</b> however, insufficient entries and so no event was held.|$|R
30|$|Given {{the failure}} of {{previous}} conventional therapy we are tempted to state that overexpression of VEGF {{at the level of}} the thigh and calf muscles prevented the amputation, which <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> alternative left for the three patients.|$|R
5|$|Day {{wished for}} the girls to be {{isolated}} from external influences while he educated them so, {{at the beginning of}} November 1769, he decided to move them to France. It is also possible that he did this to protect himself from the legal ramifications of his experiment, as well as societal gossip. The trio travelled over 600 miles to Avignon, renting a house in le quartier des fusteries. The girls could speak no French and Day employed no English-speaking servants, to be sure that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> person to influence them.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s and 70s, {{efforts were}} {{primarily}} concentrated on Line E, which was re-routed from its terminus at Constitución to {{the centre of}} the city at the Plaza de Mayo in an attempt to boost passenger figures, something which proved to be successful. The segment was opened by president Arturo Illia in 1966 and Spain offered CAF-General Eléctrica Española trains in order to cancel part of the debt it had accrued with Argentina; trains which continue to serve on the line today. The line was extended westward to José María Moreno in 1973, in what <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> expansion of the decade.|$|E
5|$|Gould {{was later}} named the NFC Special Teams Player of the Week, his third ST POTW honor and tying him with kickers Jeff Jaeger and Paul Edinger {{for the most}} in team history. The field goal was Gould's {{eleventh}} career game-winner. Forte ran for 91 yards in the game to increase his career rushing yards total to 8,071, becoming the 14th player in NFL history to record 8,000 and 3,500 career rushing and receiving yards, respectively, while becoming the second-fastest player to achieve the milestone with 111 games. The win <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> home win for the Bears all season, finishing the year with a horrific 1–7 home record. The Bears would finish 3–13 at home in both 2014 and 2015 combined.|$|E
50|$|Divine <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{first major}} release from Blinded Colony. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> {{first and last}} album to feature singer Niklas Svensson. This <b>would</b> also <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> album they {{released}} under the Scarlet Records Banner. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> released thoroughly in Europe via Scarlet Records, and in Japan through Soundholic Records.|$|R
50|$|Founded in 1999 by John Gildred, Indrema's {{goal was}} to create a video game console based on common PC {{hardware}} and the Linux operating system. <b>The</b> console <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> open source console on the market, as well as <b>the</b> <b>only</b> modern console to allow free software to be written for it.|$|R
50|$|Felton Jarvis {{was given}} {{production}} credit {{even though he}} did no actual production work — <b>the</b> credit <b>is</b> primarily a thanks to Jarvis, given that he'd helped sign The First National Band to RCA Records. Jarvis <b>would</b> also <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> person listed as a producer of Michael Nesmith albums other than Nesmith himself.|$|R
5|$|HB1001 {{made its}} first flight on 1December1977 {{at the hands of}} Lockheed test pilot, Bill Park. He would fly the next four sorties, all chased by a T-38 piloted by Major (later Lieutenant Colonel) Ken Dyson. Dyson, an F-15 Eagle pilot, was {{previously}} approached by United States Air Force personnel about the project in 1976. He made his first flight on HB1001 on 17January1978, chased by Park. In fact, the two <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> test pilots of Have Blue, alternating between the demonstrator and the chase plane. Flight test results allowed engineers to refine the FBW system. At the same time, they verified predictions made earlier by aerodynamic engineers on the aircraft's behavior.|$|E
5|$|In March 2009, Wagner {{supposedly}} {{announced that}} Sarcófago would reunite, and their tour itinerary would include appearances at the Wacken Open Air and Hole in the Sky festivals, {{as well as}} dates in London, New York, Los Angeles and Tokyo. He stated {{it would be the}} original I.N.R.I. line-up, but that this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> tour they would be doing {{and there would be no}} new material. A couple of days later, Lamounier himself wrote to the music press exposing this news report as a hoax.|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, Stallone {{confirmed}} {{that he was}} in talks with Nicolas Cage and John Travolta, and scheduling <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> obstacle to their involvement. In July 2011, Mickey Rourke was stated to be reprising his role as Tool; by late September it was reported that he had dropped out of the film, and on October 18 this was confirmed. Antonio Banderas was reportedly offered a role, but was unable to participate due to other commitments. Jackie Chan said he had been offered a role, but was forced to turn it down due to scheduling conflicts with CZ12.|$|E
50|$|Conceptual {{knowledge}} cannot {{help the}} student progress. According to David Godman, Nisargadatta “would clench his fist, bang {{it on the}} floor and shout ‘Kalpana! Kalpana!’ which means ‘Concept! Concept!’ That <b>would</b> sometimes <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> answer <b>the</b> questioners <b>would</b> get. Maharaj <b>was</b> definitely not interested in massaging visitor’s concepts. He wanted people to drop them, not discuss them”.|$|R
30|$|It {{should be}} pointed out that the optimal solution, in the case that it exists, does not have to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> same for every firm in <b>the</b> market. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> same <b>only</b> if firms have the same cost structure. Therefore, <b>the</b> market may <b>be</b> {{characterized}} by firms offering different combinations of money price and mean waiting time.|$|R
50|$|Her {{theories}} {{also included}} external conditions and materials. The conditions Cane (1951) {{believed to be}} most favorable for children were white, bare walls; spacious, lighted rooms; and visible materials. The children’s works <b>would</b> typically <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> thing decorating <b>the</b> room. Other decorations were used for specific directives and were typically brightly-colored materials that were used for stimuli.|$|R
5|$|It was {{activated}} in mid 1918, {{too late}} to join the fighting in World War I. The division {{is best known for}} its exploits during World War II as the 100th Infantry Division. Fighting in the European Theater, the division advanced through France and Germany {{through the end of the}} war, fending off serious German counterattacks along the way. World War II <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> war the division would fight in before taking on its role as a training unit.|$|E
5|$|Leslie never advertised his speakers. After {{demonstrating a}} {{prototype}} with Bob Mitchell, an organist with radio station KFI in Los Angeles, a contract {{was made to}} install another prototype in the station's studios, where Mitchell <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> organist authorized to use it. Mitchell was so impressed {{that he tried to}} patent the speaker, but discovered that he could not. Soon afterwards, Mitchell became an organist with the Mutual Broadcasting System, and played a Hammond with the Leslie on its shows, ensuring national exposure for the sound. The Leslie was subsequently a standard component of several notable jazz organists, including Jimmy Smith, Jack McDuff, Jimmy McGriff and Shirley Scott. Graham Bond was the first notable British organist to play a Hammond through a Leslie.|$|E
5|$|Medium Alison {{writes a}} letter to her parents but does not mention Joan or her recent {{realization}} she is a lesbian. Bruce orders Small Alison {{to put on a}} dress, but she would rather wear a jean jacket. Bruce tells her that she <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> girl without a dress and that the other children would laugh at her; she leaves on the dress ("Party Dress"). Medium Alison proudly tells Joan that she has written {{a letter to}} her parents telling them that she is a lesbian, but begins to second-guess herself (beginning to wonder if she's asexual) until Joan kisses her. That night, she is excited and joyful at having had sex with Joan ("Changing My Major").|$|E
50|$|Had {{the league}} gone forward with American {{teams in the}} 1996 season, <b>the</b> Manatees <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> CFL team to compete {{directly}} in an NFL market (the Baltimore Stallions refused {{to do so and}} moved to Montreal to become the revived Montreal Alouettes; had Baltimore stayed in the U.S. it would have relocated to recently vacated Houston).|$|R
50|$|Emmitt Smith's tenth {{consecutive}} 1,000 yard season(an NFL record), {{along with}} a season sweep of the rival Washington Redskins <b>would</b> prove to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> highlights in an otherwise disappointing season.|$|R
50|$|Anne Boleyn is seen {{wearing a}} lace headdress in {{numerous}} shots. In reality she <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> woman to expose her hair which <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> considered immodest, but {{which she did}} to maintain an illusion of chastity. Likewise for Catherine of Aragon, who mostly wore English or Spanish-styled gable hoods; her hair <b>would</b> never have <b>been</b> exposed as in the serial.|$|R
