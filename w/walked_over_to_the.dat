25|$|After {{several weeks}} in Ranofotsy Bay, Italian Father Luigi Mariana, with 3 Portuguese sailors {{and quite a}} few of their slaves, <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Trano Vato (near Vinanibe) where he wanted to {{establish}} a chapel and house that he and Father Freire could use as a base for their missionary efforts. They chose this site as they wanted to focus their efforts on King Chambanga and his people. After several weeks of work, having constructed both buildings, a 10m cross was also raised at this site, with another one planted which overlooked Ranofotsy bay.|$|E
25|$|As per tradition, the Sikhs {{gathered}} in the Golden Temple to celebrate the festival of Baisakhi in 1919. After their visit, many <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Jallianwala Bagh next to it to listen to speakers protesting Rowlatt Act and other policies of the colonial British government. A large crowd had gathered, when the British general Reginald Dyer ordered his soldiers to surround the Jallianwala Bagh, then open fire into the civilian crowd. Hundreds died and thousands were wounded. The massacre strengthened {{the opposition to the}} colonial rule throughout India, and particularly Sikhs. It triggered massive non-violent protests. The protests pressured the British government to transfer the control over the management and treasury of the Golden Temple to an elected organization called Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC). The SGPC continues to manage the Golden Temple.|$|E

25|$|At about 21:40 on {{the evening}} of Saturday of 7 March, four off-duty British {{soldiers}} of the Royal Engineers walked outside the barracks to receive a pizza delivery from two delivery men. As the exchange was taking place, two masked gunmen in a nearby car (a green Vauxhall Cavalier) opened fire with Romanian AKM automatic rifles. The firing lasted for more than 30 seconds with more than 60 shots being fired. After the initial burst of gunfire, the gunmen <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wounded soldiers lying on the ground and fired again at close range, killing two of them. Those killed were Sappers Mark Quinsey from Birmingham and Patrick Azimkar from London. The other two soldiers and two deliverymen were wounded. The soldiers were wearing desert fatigues and were to be deployed to Afghanistan the next day. A few hours later, the car involved was found abandoned near Randalstown, eight miles from the barracks.|$|E
25|$|But {{perhaps my}} finest memory of this lordly Frenchman came in 1966 at the NÃ¼rburgring, where a German {{official}} had been particularly rude {{to myself and}} other English journalists about going through one gate (the exit) to the press room instead of another 100 yards away (the entrance). We sat in delight, Sid Saltmarsh, Bill Long and me, not 20 yards from that 'Exit' gate, and watched as Jacques pulled up in his Ford Mustang, and proceeded to unload his bike {{from the back of}} the car. Yes, he did, not leaving it to mechanics. German official railed and cried, but all in vain. The seigniorial aspect came out oh so clearly, and Jacques did not merely ignore him, it was palpably as if the German did not exist at all. He left the car there, <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> riders' quarters pushing the gate open and the German with it. It has probably the finest comeuppance I shall ever see, and for that I shall remember Jacques for a long time.|$|E
500|$|Seeing Ike Clanton in the Alhambra Saloon around midnight, Holliday confronted Ike, {{accusing him}} of lying about their {{previous}} conversations. They got into a heated argument. Wyatt Earp (who was not wearing a badge) encouraged his brother, Tombstone Deputy City Marshal Morgan Earp, to intervene. Morgan escorted Holliday {{out onto the street}} and Ike, who had been drinking steadily, followed them. City Marshal Virgil Earp arrived a few minutes later and threatened to arrest both Holliday and Clanton if they did not stop arguing. Ike and Wyatt talked again a few minutes later, and Ike threatened to confront Holliday in the morning. Ike told Earp that the fighting talk {{had been going on for}} a long time and that he intended to put an end to it. Ike told Earp, [...] "I will be ready for you in the morning." [...] Wyatt Earp <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Oriental Saloon and Ike followed him.

2500|$|After eating, Abraham and {{the three}} {{visitors}} got up. They <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> peak that overlooked the 'cities of the plain' to discuss the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah for their detestable sins that were so great, it moved God to action. Because Abraham's nephew was living in Sodom, God revealed plans to confirm and judge these cities. At this point, the two other visitors left for Sodom. Then Abraham turned to God and pleaded decrementally with Him (from fifty persons to less) that [...] "if {{there were at least}} ten righteous men found in the city, would not God spare the city?"

Initial reports suggest that Harris asked Bernall [...] "Do you believe in God?", to which she replied yes, before getting killed. However, three students who witnessed Bernall's death, including Emily Wyant, who had been hiding beneath the table with her, have testified that Bernall did not exchange words with Harris after his initial taunt, although Wyant stated Bernall had been praying prior to her murder.|$|E

2500|$|On July 9, {{a funeral}} {{procession}} bearing {{the bodies of}} the two slain unionists walked down Market Street. [...] Estimates range from 15,000 to 50,000 in the procession. [...] Thousands more lined the sidewalks. [...] Fearing that sight of police on the streets would incite workers further, City Hall agreed that the strikers would be in charge of crowd control. [...] There was no talking, no sound except a quiet funeral dirge, and the tramp of feet, but the air was electric with that sound. [...] Their deaths â and that march â forged the solidarity that became the West Coast General Strike. [...] The march ended at 17th and Valencia at the mortuary, just two blocks away from the Labor Temple.

2500|$|Other songs express emotions, such as [...] "Come On Write Me", which expresses vulnerability, {{something}} Van Peebles {{later said}} was absent from modern recordings by African American males. Van Peebles wrote [...] "Eyes On The Rabbit" [...] as a joke, {{inspired by the}} piano player's wife, who he described as [...] "sappy". Van Peebles said, [...] "I'm going to write the sappiest song I can." [...] Van Peebles rehearsed the song at the piano player's house, where the saxophonist and his wife, and the pianist and his wife stayed inside and watched Van Peebles playing the song outside. Van Peebles <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window and saw {{that none of them}} laughed at the song. He initially thought they didn't want to laugh at him, but realized that all of them were crying, and the song had a different emotional impact than he had intended. One of the watchers congratulated Van Peebles on the song, but Van Peebles explained that the song was a joke, angering him and his girlfriend, who wanted to beat Van Peebles up. Van Peebles backed off by claiming that the song wasn't a joke.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{he became}} a {{professional}} cricketer Tyson played for Middleton in the Central Lancashire League, Knypersley in the North Staffordshire League, Durham University and the Army. Although invited for trials by Lancashire at Old Trafford he was turned down âbecause he dipped at the kneeâ, so he qualified for Northamptonshire in 1952 through residence. Tyson made his first class debut against the Indian tourists in 1952, after his first ball the slips moved back an extra five yards and his first wicket {{was that of the}} Test batsman Pankaj Roy for a duck. Tyson's second first class match was against the Australians in 1953. Richie Benaud was told that the unknown Tyson was a bowler fresh out of Durham University who would give them no trouble. They began to revise this estimation when they saw the wicket-keeper take position halfway to the boundary and young Tyson <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sightscreen to begin his run up. The first ball ricocheted off the edge of Colin McDonald's bat to the boundary, the second trapped him lbw before he could play a stroke, the third was a bouncer that flew past Graeme Hole's nose and the fourth was a yorker that clean bowled Hole and sent his stumps cartwheeling over the wicket-keeper's head. In 1954 at Old Trafford Tyson hit the sightscreen with the ball after it bounced once on the pitch. He is one of only four bowlers to have achieved this feat {{in the history of the}} game, the others being Charles Kortright, Roy Gilchrist and Jeff Thomson. and he was given his county cap in the same year, his first full First Class season. Tyson reckoned that he received his Test call up when ex-England captains Gubby Allen and Norman Yardley saw him hospitalise Bill Edrich at Lords. Edrich, a noted hooker of fast bowling, mistimed his stroke due to the speed of the ball and his cheek bone was broken. The MCC were thereby convinced of the speed and hostility of Tyson's bowling and decided to take him to Australia. He was selected to play for England against Pakistan at the Oval in 1954, taking 4â35 and 1â22 and making 3 runs in each innings batting at number eight, but Pakistan won the match by 24 runs thanks to the bowling of Fazal Mahmood. Although he batted at number eleven in league cricket [...] "The Middleton groundsman was a fatalist. He used to start up the roller to refurbish the wicket when I went in to bat". Tyson worked on his batting and in 1954 [...] "was building up a reputation as an all-rounder, scoring consistently with the bat", and he batted at number seven for England. However, this did not develop as much as expected and he reverted to being a lower-order batsman.|$|E
