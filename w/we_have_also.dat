Indeed, the present situation is the inevitable outcome of the policies pursued for decades by successive Stormont governments. It is clear also that the Irish Government can no longer stand by and see innocent people injured and perhaps worse. It is obvious that the RUC is no longer accepted as an impartial police force. Neither would the employment of British troops be acceptable nor would they be likely to restore peaceful conditions, certainly not in the long term. The Irish Government have, therefore, requested the British Government to apply immediately to the United Nations for the urgent dispatch of a Peace-Keeping Force to the Six Counties of Northern Ireland and have instructed the Permanent Representative to the United Nations to inform the Secretary General of this request. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> asked the British Government {{to see to it that}} police attacks on the people of Derry should cease immediately.|$|E

500|$|Wilson {{predicted}} in January 1966 {{that the various}} boycotts would force Smith to give in [...] "within {{a matter of weeks}} rather than months", but the British (and later UN) sanctions had little effect on Rhodesia, largely because South Africa and Portugal went on trading with it, providing it with oil and other key resources. Clandestine trade with other nations also continued, initially at a reduced level, and the diminished presence of foreign competitors helped domestic industries to slowly mature and expand. Even many OAU states, while bombarding Rhodesia with opprobrium, continued importing Rhodesian food and other products. Rhodesia thus avoided the economic cataclysm predicted by Wilson and gradually became more self-sufficient. [...] "Rhodesia can not only take it, but she can also make it," [...] Smith said on 29 April 1966, while opening the annual Central African Trade Fair in Bulawayo. [...] "When I say take it, I use it in two ways. Firstly, when it comes to sanctions we have proved we can take it.
