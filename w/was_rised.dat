The {{results showed that}} the crystallinity of phenyl silicone rubber was declined {{because of the presence of}} phenyl and the higher the phenyl content, the lower the crystallinity when the phenyl content was low. The viscosity of the phenyl silicone rubber <b>was</b> <b>rised</b> as molar mass and phenyl content of the rubber was increased but the changes was not uniform. The viscosity of the phenyl silicone rubber was declined as temperature was increased and viscosity-temperature dependence of the high molar mass phenyl silicone rubber was larger.

And each of vehicles {{has one of the}} parts which important like brake. It is used to stop the vehicle when it runs or parks. According to the reason above, the researcher was interested in investigating about this brake system deeply. And the problems that <b>was</b> <b>rised</b> were: 1. The factors which affect the braking ability, 2. Doing the treatment of brake economically, 3. Knowing the pressure power of the types of disc brake and drum brake, 4. The power of braking and the amount of pressure, 5. The analysis of the comparation between the disc brake and drum brake. Furthermore, the quantitative was used in this research because it refered to the empiric data. And this research used some of the method such as: field observation, literature of the data and from the guidance. From the result of the study could be known that combination usage of the disc brake in front wheel and drum brake in rear wheel was better because the vehicle load will rest on the front wheel of the vehicle when it was braking. Therefore, the front wheel needs types of brake which has great pressure and fast like disc brake. In addition, the treatment is needed once in month like cheking the oil brake, brake lining and the others...|$|E

40|$|The {{catalytic}} {{and regulatory}} properties of phospho-e«o/pyruvate (PEP) carboxylase (PEPC) are modulated re-markably by {{the increase in}} the level of bicarbonate in the assay medium. The activity of PEPC increased by two-fold as the concentration of bicarbonate was raised from 0. 05 to 10 mM. During this state, there was only marginal effect on Km for PEP, while the affinity of PEPC to Mg 2 + increased by> 2 fold. In contrast, the sensitivity of PEPC to malate decreased with increasing concentration of HCO 3 ~. Similar-ly, the stimulation by glucose 6 -phosphate (G- 6 -P) at op-timal concentration (10 mM) of HCO 3 ~ was much less than that at suboptimal concentration (0. 05 mM). K, for malate increased by about 3 fold and Ka for G- 6 -P rised by four-fold as bicarbonate concentration <b>was</b> <b>rised</b> from 0. 05 to 10 mM. These results suggest that HCO 3 " desensitizes PEPC to both malate and G- 6 -P. Further, these changes were manifested in both dark- as well as light-forms of the enzyme. Similar results were obtained with PEPC in leaf extracts or in purified form. We therefore propose that bi-carbonate-induced changes are independent of phospho-rylation and possibly through a significant change in the conformation of the enzyme. This is the first detailed re-port indicating marked modulation of regulatory and catalytic properties of PEPC by bicarbonate, one of its sub-strate...|$|E

The technic that had been used to collect the data is by documentation. The data source is from internet and PT Telkom Divre IV. Quantitative data analysis has been done by accounting the ratio and EVA consept. The result of this research are that on the period 2003 – 2007, PT Telkom Tbk. has unsecured liquidity level, the Profitability ratio shows the good condition, because the profit are increased. The Solvability ratio shows that the company’s asset didn’t paid by the capital charges, but it was came by long or short term debt. The Activity ratio shows the good condition, it’s seen by the value of Inventory Turn Over and Collection Period are shorter and Total Asset Turn Over has increased. It proved that the company’s affectivity and efficiency has increased. From the value of EVA, it has known that EVA< 0, which mean on that period, the company does not have the Value Added.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the association between}} portal vein pressure drop gradient in patients with cirrhotic portal hypertension treated by transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) and clinical prognosis, {{as well as the}} ideal range of portal vein pressure drop. MethodsA total of 58 patients who underwent TIPS in Xinqiao Hospital of Third Military Medical University from November 2013 to December 2015 were enrolled. All the patients underwent TIPS and embolization of the gastric coronary vein and the short gastric veins, and the change intervals of portal vein pressure gradient were monitored. The follow-up time ranged from 3 days to 2 years, and the association of portal vein pressure drop gradient with postoperative liver function, splenic function, rebleeding rate, hepatic encephalopathy, and portal hypertensive gastrointestinal diseases was analyzed. The paired t-test was used for comparison of parameters before and after treatment. ResultsThe patients had a significant reduction in liver function on day 3 after surgery. At 2 month after surgery, the levels of TBil <b>was</b> <b>rised</b> and had significant changes［(49. 81 ± 27. 82) μmol/L vs (31. 64 ± 17. 67) μmol/L,t= 5. 372,P＜ 0. 001 ］. At 6 months after surgery, red blood cell count and platelet count had no significant changes，but，white blood cell count was reduced［(3. 79 ± 1. 37 ）× 109 /L vs (4. 57 ± 2. 24) × 109 /L，t= 2. 835 ，P= 0. 006 ］. There was a 23 % reduction in portal vein pressure after surgery (from 30. 62 ± 3. 56 mmHg before surgery to 21. 21 ± 2. 90 mmHg after surgery, t= 23. 318 ，P＜ 0. 001). All the patients had varying degrees of relief of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with portal vein hypertension, such as abdominal distension, poor appetite, and diarrhea. Of all patients, none experienced in-stent restenosis or occlusion and 13 experienced hepatic encephalopathy after surgery, which tended to occur at the time when postoperative portal vein pressure was reduced to 14. 7 - 25. 7 mmHg, i. e., a 36 %- 40 % reduction in portal vein pressure. The results of splenic venography performed immediately after surgery showed that varicose veins almost disappeared and that there were no collateral varices. Gastroscopy was performed again within 1 month after surgery and 5 patients had no significant changes in esophageal varices. The other patients were followed up for 2 years, and the severity of esophageal and gastric varices gradually changed from severe varices with red color sign to moderate and mild varices and even disappeared. The proportion of patients with mild and disappeared varices increased from 22 % on day 3 after surgery to 52 % in the second year after surgery. No patients experienced rebleeding within 1 month after surgery. Six patients each experienced rebleeding at 2, 6, 10, 14, 16, and 24 months after surgery, and in one patient, duodenal bulbar ulcer and bleeding was not excluded; the other 5 patients experienced gastric variceal bleeding again, with a median portal vein pressure of 36. 46 mmHg before surgery and 24. 8 mmHg after surgery, with a 32 % reduction in portal vein pressure. ConclusionTIPS has a good clinical effect in hemostasis and prevention of rebleeding in patients with cirrhotic portal hypertension and can control the portal vein pressure below 21. 21 ± 2. 90 mmHg, and the degree of reduction in portal vein pressure is below 36 %- 40 %. It can reduce the incidence of postoperative rebleeding and avoid the development of hepatic encephalopathy. TIPS can cause liver impairment within {{a short period of time}} after surgery, and liver function can return to normal within 1 - 6 months after surgery, but splenic function does not recover significantly...|$|E
