This is the secret that has not yet been told in the affair: the story of the security fiasco that made it possible for Vanunu to do what he did, and the story of subsequent attempts to cover-up, whitewash and protect senior figures in the defense establishment, who were bent on divesting themselves of responsibility for the failure.|$|E

However, although finished early in anticipation of a September 2010 release date, Parks was ultimately placed on hiatus until early 2011, many months after production on [...] "Flu Season" [...] was already finished. Although initially titled [...] "The Flu" [...] in original press releases, and referred to as such by several news articles, the episode title was later formally changed to [...] "Flu Season".

500|$|In the off-season, it was speculated {{by many in}} {{the media}} whether Luongo should remain Vancouver's captain, citing the added {{pressure}} of the goaltending position. After the Canucks' 3–1 series deficit in the second round, Luongo ceased to make himself available for pre-game interviews – a customary practice for goaltenders, but not for captains. When asked after the Canucks' elimination whether he thought he should remain team captain, he told reporters he did not think it was an issue. However, Gillis, who appointed him captain two seasons prior, asserted it was a topic to be addressed in the off-season. On September 13, 2010, Luongo confirmed he was stepping down, stating that [...] "Serv as captain...in a Canadian city for a team with such passionate fans is a privilege and an experience I will always take pride in. I <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> leader on this team and support my teammates the same way I always have while focusing on our ultimate goal." [...] Centre Henrik Sedin, who won the Hart Trophy for the 2009–10 season, was named Luongo's successor in a pre-game ceremony to the Canucks' season-opener.|$|E

The banks could try to collect on the collateral (land), but due to reduced real estate values, this would not pay off the loan. Banks have delayed the decision to collect on the collateral, hoping asset prices would improve. These delays were allowed by national banking regulators.

2500|$|The affair {{became public}} {{knowledge}} in the press a decade later, {{with the publication of}} Diana: Her True Story in 1992, followed by the Camillagate scandal in 1993, wherein an intimate telephone conversation between Camilla and Charles was secretly recorded and the transcripts were published in the tabloids. The book and tape instantly damaged Charles's reputation. Meanwhile, the press vilified Camilla. In 1994, Charles finally spoke about his relationship with Camilla in a televised interview with Jonathan Dimbleby. He told Dimbleby in the interview, [...] "Mrs. Parker Bowles is a great friend of mine...a friend for a very long time. She <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> friend for a long time." [...] The same year he admitted in his biography written by Dimbleby that the relationship between him and Camilla rekindled after his marriage had [...] "irretrievably broken down" [...] in 1986.

He comforts his commissioner by the reminder that a population after all has one great human heart, and a great human heart is that which chiefly exalts the Man of Genius over the mere Man of Talent, so that when a Man of Genius with practical experience of the principles of sound government comes face to face with a people whose interest it is to be governed well, the chances are that they will understand each other.|$|E
