5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of aerial reconnaissance, Liman von Sanders had fairly {{accurate}} knowledge on 17 September 1918, regarding the forces deployed against his Fourth, Seventh and Eighth Armies. He understood there to be five infantry divisions and a French detachment facing the Eighth Army with another two divisions facing the Seventh Army and two mounted divisions facing the Fourth Army. Liman von Sanders <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> by the strength and location of the attack. He shifted all his available reserves and reinforcements to the west, not to the east. The strategically vital coastal plain was the most strongly defended sector of the front line. Here Liman von Sanders deployed his most experienced infantry divisions supported by heavy artillery.|$|E
5|$|The {{top three}} drivers of both races {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and at a later press conference. After the first race, Giovinazzi {{said he had been}} amazed at his first victory in the GP2 Series and thanked his team and his primary sponsor. He stated that he did not think that he would able to secure his first victory before the season was over, and was happy to score the points he earned for himself and his team. Sirotkin said the race was not easy for him because {{he did not have the}} start he intended. He said that he was happy with his second-place result but would not to be content finishing in either second or third in every event. Marciello stated that he expected some safety cars to affect the race but was unhappy with how many there were as they had prevented him building a large enough gap to his rivals. He said that his third-place finish was good for his team and revealed that he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> when Sirotkin passed him on the start/finish straight on the first race's final lap as he saw him close up to him under the safety car.|$|E
25|$|In March 2013 the Member of Parliament for Palmerston North, Iain Lees-Galloway, {{presented}} a petition of 2,000 signatures supporting the service at a parliamentary select committee hearing.

25|$|Dmitry had {{anticipated}} a clash with Germany {{for years and}} <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> at the outbreak of World War I. By then, he was almost blind which kept him from participating in the conflict, {{and he had to}} content himself with a job training the cavalry regiments away from the field of action.|$|E
25|$|While at Edwards, Cooper was {{intrigued}} {{to read an}} announcement saying that a contract had been awarded to McDonnell Aircraft in St. Louis, Missouri, to build a space capsule. Shortly after this he was called to Washington, D.C., for a NASA briefing on Project Mercury and the part astronauts would play in it. Cooper went through the selection process with the other 109 pilots and <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> when he was accepted as {{the youngest of the}} first seven American astronauts.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the strangest}} moments in Zakharov's career {{occurred}} in late 1990, when, {{as a member of}} the parliamentary Australian Security Intelligence Organisation committee, she was given access to her own intelligence file. She <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> to discover that ASIO had shown interest in her membership of the Communist Party while at university; what she was not prepared for was a detailed investigation the organisation had made in 1963, after becoming concerned that John Zakharov was a bigamist. A less-than-impressed Zakharov speculated at the time that the contents of her file may have cost her at least one public service position during the 1970s.|$|E

25|$|Bevin had {{no great}} faith in {{parliamentary}} politics, but had nevertheless {{been a member}} of the Labour Party from the time of its formation, and unsuccessfully fought Bristol Central at the 1918 General Election, being defeated by the Coalition Conservative Thomas Inskip. He had poor relations with the first Labour Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald, and <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> when MacDonald formed a National Government with the Conservatives during the economic crisis of 1931, for which MacDonald was expelled from the Labour Party. At the 1931 general election, Bevin was persuaded by the remaining leaders of the Labour Party to contest Gateshead, on the understanding that if successful he would remain as general secretary of the TGWU. The National Government landslide resulted in Gateshead being lost by a large margin to the Liberal National Thomas Magnay.|$|E
25|$|Following his {{guilty plea}} on {{misdemeanor}} weapons charges during the 2009 offseason, Lynch met with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for a disciplinary hearing. Lynch {{had been arrested}} in Culver City, California, for having {{a gun in his}} backpack in the trunk of a car he was occupying, a crime in California. On April 9, the NFL announced that Lynch would be suspended for the Bills' first three games for violations of the NFL's personal conduct policy. Lynch appealed the league's suspension on May 14 in an attempt to have it reduced or nullified, only to have it upheld by Goodell later on August 3. When interviewed on the topic, Lynch has said that he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> when the suspension was upheld and that he loves playing too much and will try to keep himself out of situations {{in which there is a}} risk of being suspended.|$|E
25|$|The {{course of}} the battle showed that the first Carthaginian line {{performed}} better and the Gauls were less reliable. From the onset, the Romans made futile attempts to break the enemy’s resistance and were pressed hard themselves. Then Varus moved the cavalry (3,000 or 4,000 horsemen), hoping to repulse and confuse the Carthaginian lines. However, Mago <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> and moved forward the elephants just in time. The horses were stricken by fear {{and as a result}} the Roman cavalry was dispersed, chased by Mago’s light Numidian cavalry. The elephants turned on the Roman infantry, which suffered heavy losses. The battle only took a bad turn for Mago when Cornelius brought into action the legions of the second line. The elephants were showered upon by darts, with most of them falling, the rest were forced to turn back against their own ranks. Mago ordered the Gauls to stop the Roman counter-attack, but they were routed.|$|E

500|$|Governor John W. Bricker of Ohio, who {{did become}} the Republican vice-presidential nominee in 1944, helped Willis in his race. Upon Willis' victory, Bricker wired {{a friend to}} express jubilation, {{which turned out to}} have been unfounded: [...] "Election showed {{definite}} trend in all areas against New Deal. I <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> at the outcome particularly in Kentucky because the thinking {{of the people of the}} Middle West is in line with results down there.

Lamounier declared he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> that things turned out {{the way they did}} as, in his words, [...] "with what I knew of them, I think it's quite normal that one brother should betray another in that family, they don't measure the consequences to get what they want. So, a brother backstabbing the other, deceiving their mother, cheating a friend... For money, I'll bet they're capable of anything." ...|$|E
500|$|Described as [...] "the {{slightly}} broken sister who's {{one step}} away from a vodka bottle", Rainie's storylines have often centred on her addictions to drugs and alcohol. During her seven episode guest stint in 2010, Rainie {{was involved in a}} highly criticised crack cocaine storyline with Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). It was branded [...] "inappropriate" [...] and [...] "horrid" [...] by the Daily Record. EastEnders star Natalie Cassidy (who plays Sonia Fowler) also criticised the storyline, saying she was [...] "shocked", but Franks defended the storyline, though she herself <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> that viewers had complained.|$|E
500|$|Muhammad {{was deeply}} distressed upon {{receiving}} his first revelations. After returning home, Muhammad was consoled and reassured by Khadijah and her Christian cousin, Waraqah ibn Nawfal. He also feared that others would dismiss his claims as being possessed. Shi'a tradition states Muhammad <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> or frightened at Gabriel's appearance; rather he welcomed the angel, {{as if he}} was expected. The initial revelation was followed by a three-year pause (a period known as fatra) during which Muhammad felt depressed and further gave himself to prayers and spiritual practices. When the revelations resumed he was reassured and commanded to begin preaching: [...] "Thy Guardian-Lord hath not forsaken thee, nor is He displeased." ...|$|E

Actress Eihi Shiina stated that, in Japan, only a certain type of film fan would watch Audition. By comparison, she said, the film was seen by many more people overseas, which she attributed to [...] "good timing".|$|E
500|$|Several film reviewers drew precise {{parallels}} between the film and certain superhero comic books, like Powers, Watchmen, Fantastic Four, and The Avengers. Indeed, the producers of the 2005 adaptation of Fantastic Four were forced to make significant script changes and add more special effects because of similarities to The Incredibles. Bird <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> that comparisons arose due to superheroes being [...] "the most well-trod turf on the planet," [...] but noted {{that he had not}} been inspired by any comic books specifically, only having heard of Watchmen. He did comment that it was nice to be compared to it, since [...] "if you're going to be compared to something, it's nice if it's something good".|$|E
500|$|Marshall {{was known}} for his quick wit and a good sense of humor. On hearing of his {{nomination}} as vice president, he announced that he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>surprised,</b> as [...] "Indiana is the mother of Vice Presidents; home of more second-class men than any other state". One of his favorite jokes, which he delivered in a speech {{on the eve of his}} departure for Washington D.C. to become vice president, recounted a story of a man with two sons. One of the sons went to sea and drowned and the other was elected vice president; neither son was ever heard from again. On his election as vice president, he sent Woodrow Wilson a book, inscribed [...] "From your only Vice".|$|E
