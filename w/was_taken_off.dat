5|$|Alfonso XIII {{served in}} the Spanish fleet from 1915 to 1937. Spain {{remained}} neutral during World War I, and so Alfonso XIII and her sisters were the only European dreadnoughts to avoid the war. She and her sisters participated in the Rif War, where they provided gunfire support to Spanish Army forces. The ship was seized by General Francisco Franco at {{the outbreak of the}} Spanish Civil War. While steaming off Santander on 30 April 1937, she struck a mine and sank; most of her crew <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> by the destroyer Velasco.|$|E

Doubts over Matthew Etherington's fitness resurfaced when he <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> in the 63rd minute, with Stoke City still in the game at 0–0 as it stood.|$|E

And I've got a feeling that if he leaves Cheltenham he will get a similar reception if he comes back with another club. Supporters recognise him and they see the whole-heartedness and the commitment and the ability that he has got.|$|E

At September's Fall Brawl, Wilson and Douglas defeated Kidman and Madusa in a mixed tag team match with scaffolding erected above the ring. Wilson was released from WCW in December 2000.

5|$|Buffon {{made his}} first {{appearance}} for Italy under new manager Antonio Conte on 9 September 2014, captaining his team in their opening European Championship qualifying match against Norway in Oslo. He kept a clean sheet as Italy won the match 2–0. On 12 June 2015, Buffon became {{the first player to}} appear in 50 UEFA competitive international matches in Italy's 1–1 away draw against Croatia in a European qualifying match. Buffon saved an early Mario Mandžukić penalty, but <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> at half time and replaced by Salvatore Sirigu due to an injury. He made his 150th appearance for Italy on 6 September 2015, keeping a clean sheet in a home 1–0 win over Bulgaria, his 62nd clean sheet at the international level. Italy qualified for Euro 2016 on 10 October in a 3–1 win over Azerbaijan.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1968, No.79 Squadron {{no longer}} had a clear role at Ubon. The USAF had {{sufficient}} fighters based in Thailand to defend the country and was reluctant to use the Australian fighters—which were now regarded as obsolete—to intercept potentially hostile aircraft, as the squadron's rules of engagement did not allow it to pursue contacts that left Thai airspace. As a result, the Australian military's chiefs of staff determined that the RAAF presence in Thailand had outlived its political and military usefulness and decided to withdraw the squadron without replacement. No.79 Squadron <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> alert status on 26July and disbanded {{at the end of the}} month. On 31March 2011 it received a battle honour for its deployment to Ubon between May 1962 and August 1968.|$|E

5|$|Consequently, Taiji's bid {{to expand}} their school lunch {{programs}} to include dolphin and whale meat brought about much controversy. An estimated 150kg (330lbs) of dolphin meat was served in Taiji school lunches in 2006. In 2009, dolphin meat <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> school menus because of the contamination. The levels of mercury and methylmercury taken from samples of dolphin and whale meat sold at supermarkets {{most likely to be}} providing the schools' lunch programs was 10 times that advised by the Japanese Health Ministry. The mercury levels were so high that the Okuwa Co. supermarket chain in Japan permanently removed dolphin meat from its shelves.|$|E
5|$|Hasselbaink {{came to the}} {{attention}} of Netherlands manager Guus Hiddink whilst playing in England for Leeds United, and made his international debut on 27 May 1998 in a 0–0 draw in a friendly with Cameroon at the GelreDome in Arnhem; he came on as a 61st-minute substitute for Marc Overmars. On 1 June he scored his first goal in a 5–1 friendly victory over Paraguay, and a few days later scored his second goal in another 5–1 friendly victory over Nigeria. He was part of the Dutch squad for the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France, as back-up to established international strikers Patrick Kluivert, Dennis Bergkamp and Pierre van Hooijdonk and wingers Boudewijn Zenden and Marc Overmars. With other strikers not fully fit, Hasselbaink started the opening game against Belgium at the Stade de France, but missed a scoring opportunity in the 0–0 draw and <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> for Bergkamp after 65 minutes. Kluivert was sent off in the match but Bergkamp was played as the only striker in the next game against South Korea, and van Hooijdonk <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> the bench to replace him. In the third group game against Mexico at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard Hasselbaink came on for Bergkamp after 78 minutes, which was to be his last appearance at the tournament as Kluivert returned from suspension to leave Hasselbaink as Hiddink's fourth choice forward; Netherlands ended the tournament in fourth place.|$|E
5|$|Hiddink {{resigned}} {{and was replaced}} by his assistant Frank Rijkaard, who rarely picked Hasselbaink at international level. He next played on 18 August 1999, alongside Kluivert and Ruud van Nistelrooy in a friendly against Denmark; he <b>was</b> <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> for Clarence Seedorf and the game ended 0–0. He next appeared six months later, playing ten minutes against Germany and 70 minutes against Scotland, and despite van Nistelrooy being injured Hasselbaink was not selected for UEFA Euro 2000 as the five forwards chosen were Bergkamp, Kluivert, van Hooijdonk, Roy Makaay and Peter van Vossen. He {{had been part of the}} 25 man initial squad but, along with André Ooijer and Winston Bogarde, was not chosen for the final 22.|$|E
