5|$|A {{centre of}} capitalism, Manchester <b>was</b> <b>once</b> <b>the</b> scene {{of bread and}} labour riots, as well as calls for greater {{political}} recognition by the city's working and non-titled classes.

The Jakawitz complex has not been investigated archaeologically. Drawings by Rivera y Maestre suggest that the temple was a narrow building with four or five terraces.|$|E
