The main character dreams of becoming white but ultimately seems to accept being black and the full history of African Americans in the United States.

5|$|Fear of a Black Planet {{features}} elaborate sound collages {{that incorporate}} varying rhythms, numerous samples, media sound bites, and eccentric loops, reflecting the songs' confrontational tone. Recorded during {{the golden age}} of hip hop, its assemblage of reconfigured and recontextualized aural sources preceded the sample clearance system that later emerged in the music industry. Fear of a Black Planet explores themes about organization and empowerment <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> community, social issues affecting African Americans, and race relations at the time. The record's criticism of institutional racism, White supremacy, and the power elite was partly inspired by Dr. Frances Cress Welsing's views on color.|$|E

On August 5, 2008 Jones lost the run-off election to Jim Martin by a margin of 20 points. Jones unexpectedly lost to Martin in his home base of Dekalb County. Jones had lost support <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> community before the runoff election, and only captured two-thirds of the black vote in the head to head match up against Martin. The black turnout in the run-off was also substantially lower than the initial primary election, further hurting Vernon Jones' chances in the runoff.|$|E

25|$|Historian Donald R. Shaffer {{maintained}} that the gains during Reconstruction for African Americans were not entirely extinguished.

Its result has been a pathological self-hate within blacks themselves.

25|$|In the South, {{many poor}} whites were {{illiterate}} {{as there was}} almost no public education before the war.

25|$|Unblack metal (or Christian black metal) is a {{genre of}} heavy metal {{music that is}} stylistically close {{to the sound of}} black metal, but whose artists are either {{directly}} against the Satanism prevalent in black metal, or promote Christianity in their lyrics and imagery.

It is also suggested that Christianity contradicts black metal's dark nature and the individualistic and misanthropic ideals of many bands.|$|E
