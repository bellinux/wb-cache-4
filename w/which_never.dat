5|$|Because of the {{specialized}} and rare circumstances {{required for a}} biological structure to fossilize, logic dictates that known fossils represent {{only a small percentage}} of all life-forms that ever existed—and that each discovery represents only a snapshot of evolution. The transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils, <b>which</b> <b>never</b> demonstrate an exact half-way point between clearly divergent forms.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the Filipino Premier League (FPL) was {{established}} as the top-flight {{competition in the}} Philippines. It featured eight clubs from the National Capital Region. The PFF also planned a Visayas and Mindanao FPL tournament in 2009, <b>which</b> <b>never</b> materialized. The first and only champion of the league, which was cancelled at the season's conclusion, was the Philippine Army.|$|E

5|$|Several {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were}} made to produce sequels and remakes in the decades following Caligaris release. Robert Wiene bought the rights to Caligari from Universum Film AG in 1934 with the intention of filming a sound remake, <b>which</b> <b>never</b> materialized before Wiene's death in 1938. He intended to cast Jean Cocteau as Cesare, and a script, believed to be written by Wiene, indicated the Expressionist style would have been replaced with a French surrealist style.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin {{collaborated with}} Warren Beatty {{on a couple}} of scripts, one of which was Bulworth. Beatty, known for {{occasionally}} personally financing his film projects through pre-production, also hired Sorkin to rewrite a script titled Ocean of Storms <b>which</b> <b>never</b> went into production. At one point Sorkin sued Beatty for proper compensation for his work on the Ocean of Storms script; once the matter was settled, he resumed working on the script.|$|E
5|$|The 21st did {{not reach}} the stone wall on Marye's Heights but took shelter in a very slight {{depression}} in the terrain, remaining pinned in that position until night. Under the cover of darkness, the regiment retired, only to be ordered to the same spot the next morning, expecting a Confederate counterattack <b>which</b> <b>never</b> came. The regiment lost {{a third of its}} numbers at Frederickburg.|$|E

"Le vieux P----," [...] I have no doubt, will go {{staggering}} {{down the}} Rue de la Paix to-day, with his stick {{in his hand}} and his hat on one side, predicting the downfall of everything, in consequence of this event. His handwriting shakes more and more every quarter, and I think he mixes a great deal of cognac with his ink. He always gives me some astonishing piece of news (<b>which</b> is <b>never</b> true), or some suspicious public prophecy (<b>which</b> is <b>never</b> verified), and he always tells me he is dying (<b>which</b> he <b>never</b> is).|$|R

5|$|This was {{the first}} {{appearance}} of The Next Generation era Starfleet dress uniforms. They were based on those used by the Royal Navy in the 18th century but would be slightly altered when they re-appeared during season two. One piece of a costume introduced in this episode <b>which</b> <b>never</b> returned was the surgical cap and eyepiece worn by Doctor Crusher.|$|E
5|$|After {{the start}} of World War II, he enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force in November 1941 in the artillery. He was sent to Warwick Farm, then on the western {{outskirts}} of Sydney, for training. A non-conformist known for being forthright, Fingleton did not enjoy military discipline. In May 1942, he went AWOL from his post at Double Bay {{on the shores of}} Sydney Harbour to visit his wife. As a result, he was missing when a Japanese midget submarine launched an attack in the harbour. Soon after, he was deployed to Townsville in northern Queensland in anticipation of a Japanese land invasion, <b>which</b> <b>never</b> materialised. He was then transferred to the Press Relations unit. There he did work in intelligence analysis and censorship.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Congress {{changed the}} name of the Washington National Airport to the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport with the law specifying that no money be spent to {{implement}} the name change. As a result, WMATA did not change {{the name of the}} National Airport Station (<b>which</b> <b>never</b> included the full name of the airport). In response to repeated inquiries from Republican congressmen that the station be renamed, WMATA stated that stations are renamed only {{at the request of the}} local jurisdiction. Because both Arlington County and the District of Columbia were controlled by Democrats, the name change was blocked. Not until 2001 did Congress make changing the station's name a condition of further federal funding.|$|E

5|$|In March 1941, III./ JG52 flew several sorties as {{aerial cover}} for the German 12th Army as it crossed the Danube into Bulgaria in {{preparation}} for the German intervention in the Greco-Italian War and its Balkan Campaign. During that operation, Graf’s unit was kept back to defend the strategically vital Ploiești oilfields from Allied bombing raids, <b>which</b> <b>never</b> eventuated. In May, Graf was able to organise a second soccer international against a Romanian army team. For this, he called upon Herberger, now manager of the national team. Herberger arranged for several of the German squad to play, including an international debut by Fritz Walter. With Graf in goal, it was Walter who scored a hattrick in the 3–2 win.|$|E
5|$|In the Life of Tacitus, {{the emperor}} is {{acclaimed}} by the Senate, {{meeting in the}} Curia Pompiliana, <b>which</b> <b>never</b> existed. The History then lists a number of individuals, {{all of whom are}} invented by the author: the consul 'Velius Cornificius Gordianus', 'Maecius Faltonius Nicomachus', the Prefect of the City 'Aelius Cesettianus', and the Praetorian Prefect 'Moesius Gallicanus'. Private letters commending Tacitus are quoted from the senators 'Autronius Tiberianus' and 'Claudius Sapilianus', both of whom are assumed to be fictitious. Most of the 'Maecii' and 'Gallicani' in the History are believed to be inventions of the author.|$|E
5|$|Some of the Device Forts {{played a}} role in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 against Charles' brother, King James II. The townsfolk of Deal seized their local castle in support of William of Orange, and took steps to defend the Downs against a feared Irish {{invasion}} <b>which</b> <b>never</b> materialised. Southsea Castle was held by the King's illegitimate son, James FitzJames, the Duke of Berwick, who was pressurised into surrendering as his father's cause collapsed. Yarmouth was controlled by Robert Holmes, a supporter of James, but was prevented from actively supporting the loyalist cause by the local inhabitants and his garrison, who sided with William.|$|E

5|$|The Animated Series won Star Treks first Emmy Award on May 15, 1975. Star Trek: TAS briefly {{returned}} to {{television in the}} mid-1980s on the children's cable network Nickelodeon. Nickelodeon's Evan McGuire greatly admired the show and used its various creative components as inspiration for his short series called Piggly Wiggly Hears a Sound <b>which</b> <b>never</b> aired. Nickelodeon parent Viacom would purchase Paramount in 1994. In the early 1990s, the Sci-Fi Channel also began rerunning TAS. The complete TAS was also released on Laserdisc format during the 1980s. The complete series was first released in the U.S. on eleven volumes of VHS tapes in 1989. All 22 episodes were released on DVD in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The ceasefire of 3 January allowed {{implementation}} of the Vance plan, which provided {{for the protection of}} civilians in specific areas designated as UN Protected Areas (UNPAs) and deployment of UN peacekeepers in Croatia. One of the UNPAs defined by the plan, UNPA Western Slavonia, encompassed parts of the municipalities of Novska and Nova Gradiška, as well as the entire municipalities of Daruvar, Grubišno Polje and Pakrac. Thus the UNPA covered the area held by the JNA on 3 January, additional territory to the north, recaptured by the HV in late 1991, and towns <b>which</b> <b>never</b> came under SAO Western Slavonia controlsuch as Grubišno Polje and Daruvar. The peacekeeping force named United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), initially expected to be 10,000-strong, started to deploy on 8 March.|$|E
5|$|The end came swiftly in {{the months}} after the Grey Cup. By the time of a December 1 CFL Board of Governors meeting, the Mad Dogs had already folded and the Barracudas were on the brink. The Pirates held out a little longer and flirted with a {{relocation}} to Norfolk, but local officials broke off talks after they learned that Glieberman was still facing legal disputes in Shreveport. The Barracudas resurfaced in the news in January 1996 when Williams sold them for $750,000 to a group that planned to move them to Shreveport as a replacement for the Pirates. However, that deal was contingent upon the league approving the sale and relocation, <b>which</b> <b>never</b> happened.|$|E

5|$|The {{end of the}} war {{drastically}} reduced military investment in the island. Increasing enforcement of gambling laws and the growth of Las Vegas put pressure on the gaming industry on the island. Finally, in 1957, Texas Attorney General Will Wilson and the Texas Rangers began a massive campaign of raids which wrecked gambling and prostitution in the city. As these vice industries crashed, so did tourism taking the rest of the Galveston economy with it. Neither the economy nor the culture of the city was the same afterward. Civic leaders made several failed attempts at new ventures including the failed Oleander Bowl football tournament and the Pelican Island Bridge for access to a new industrial park <b>which</b> <b>never</b> materialized. Nevertheless, key non-entertainment sectors such as insurance, banking, and the medical school helped to keep the economy viable.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} funded {{flood control}} projects involving {{the building of}} , thus aiding the speed of waterborne transport and allowing undeveloped areas to become irrigated farmlands. These conscription labor projects allowed for the building of new hamlets which were dependent on the government for their livelihoods. When {{the authority of the}} central government declined in the late Eastern Han period, many commoners living in such hamlets were forced to flee their lands and work as tenants on large estates of wealthy landowners. The people of older hamlets <b>which</b> <b>never</b> had to rely on central government projects for their wellbeing or existence often sought support from powerful local families.|$|E

The final member of the group to be added was Sunny, who had become an S.M. trainee in 1998 and trained for five years before moving to another company, Starworld. At Starworld, she trained to debut in a duo named Sugar, <b>which</b> <b>never</b> debuted. In 2007, on the {{recommendation}} of Japanese singer Ayumi Hamasaki, Sunny moved back to S.M.
