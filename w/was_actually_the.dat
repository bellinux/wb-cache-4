5|$|Most {{of these}} techniques, {{particularly}} paraphrase and parody, became standardized {{during the first}} half of the 16th century; Josquin was very much a pioneer, and what was perceived by later observers as the mixing of these techniques <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> process by which they were created.|$|E
5|$|The first taping {{commenced}} on June 24, 1963. Garland's {{old friend}} and frequent MGM co-star Mickey Rooney was, at Garland's insistence, her first guest—although, because the network elected to air the series out of production order, this <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> tenth episode to be broadcast.|$|E
5|$|Frank's {{ability to}} foretell the murders puts him under {{suspicion}} {{with the police}} and FBI agent Milton Dammers, who is convinced Frank is responsible.

5|$|Goddard had a weak {{heart and}} had never flown before, so he asked his doctor, William Kirkwood, to {{accompany}} him on the trip. As Kirkwood was a resident at a maternity hospital, his presence led to false speculation that Simpson was pregnant, and even {{that she was having}} an abortion. The press excitedly reported that the solicitor had flown to Simpson accompanied by a gynaecologist and an anaesthetist (who <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> lawyer's clerk).|$|E
5|$|Honoré (named after Saint-Honoré of Amiens, who is commemorated on 16 May, {{four days}} before Balzac's birthday) <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> second child born to the Balzacs; exactly one year previous, Louis-Daniel had been born, but he lived for only a month. Honoré's sisters Laure and Laurence were born in 1800 and 1802, {{and his younger brother}} Henry-François in 1807.|$|E
5|$|Leonidas' {{actions have}} been the subject of much discussion. It is {{commonly}} stated that the Spartans were obeying the laws of Sparta by not retreating, but it seems it <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> failure to retreat from Thermopylae that gave rise to the notion that Spartans never retreated. It is also possible that, recalling the words of the Oracle, Leonidas was committed to sacrifice his life in order to save Sparta. However, since the prophecy was specific to him, this seems a poor reason to commit 1,500 other men to a fight to the death.|$|E

5|$|Overclaiming in {{aerial warfare}} is not uncommon. During the Second World War, pilots often claimed more {{aircraft}} shot down than <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> case. The Air Ministry released a press statement on 15 September that 175–185 German aircraft {{had been shot}} down. The actual number of aircraft destroyed was ⅔ lower and significantly less {{than the number of}} German losses on 15 and 18 August (The Hardest Day), in which the Luftwaffe lost 75 and 69 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} Charles was crowned as Charles XI {{does not mean}} that he was the 11th king of Sweden who had the name Charles. His father's name (as the 10th) was due to his great-grandfather, King Charles IX of Sweden (1604–1611), having adopted his own numeral by using a mythological History of Sweden. This {{descendant}} <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> 5th King Charles. The numbering tradition thus begun still continues, with the present king of Sweden being Carl XVI Gustaf.|$|E

5|$|At {{the reunification}} summit, the {{president}} personally requested Hyun-jun {{to be at}} his side. Concurrently, NSS agents realized they've been duped: the presumed dead IRIS agents at the mall crisis <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> hostages. The true IRIS agents escaped and infiltrated the summit to kill all delegates. IRIS agents killed and replaced various security agents for a massacre. Unfortunately, it failed with Seung-hee's interference. She pretended to be an IRIS agent and used the confusion to stop them. This created mass panic as IRIS agents make their stand against all security forces. Ultimately, the SK president and NK forces survived the assault and Hyun-jun saved the day again.|$|E
5|$|In 1054, {{relations}} between the Eastern and Western traditions within the Christian Church reached a terminal crisis, known as the East–West Schism. Although there was a formal declaration of institutional separation, on July 16, when three papal legates entered the Hagia Sophia during Divine Liturgy on a Saturday afternoon and placed a bull of excommunication on the altar, the so-called Great Schism <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> culmination of centuries of gradual separation. Unfortunately the legates {{did not know that}} the Pope had died, an event that made the excommunication void and the excommunication only applied to the Patriarch who responded by excommunicating the legates.|$|E

5|$|In 1642 the English Civil War {{broke out}} between the Royalist {{supporters}} of Charles I and those of Parliament. South Wales was predominantly Royalist in sympathy, and during the conflict, a sconce, or small fort, was built overlooking Caerphilly Castle to the north-west, {{on the site of}} the old Roman fort. It is uncertain if this was built by Royalist forces or by the Parliamentary army that occupied the area during the final months of the war in March 1646, but the fort's guns would have dominated the interior of the castle. It is also uncertain whether or not Caerphilly Castle was deliberately slighted by Parliament to prevent its future use as a fortification. Although several towers had collapsed by the 18th century, possibly as a result of such an operation, it is probable that this deterioration <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> result of subsidence damage caused when the water defences retreated, as there is no evidence of deliberate destruction having been ordered.|$|E
5|$|In 1776 the German {{zoologist}} Peter Simon Pallas formally {{described the}} bluebuck as Antilope leucophaeus. In 1853, the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck {{stated that the}} type specimen was an adult male skin now in the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden (formerly Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie), collected in Swellendam and present in Haarlem before 1776. It has been questioned whether this <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> type specimen, but in 1969, the Dutch zoologists Antonius M. Husson and Lipke Holthuis selected it as the lectotype of a syntype series, as Pallas may have based his description on multiple specimens.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, the British naturalist Henry Ogg Forbes {{described}} a second species of Necropsar, N. leguati, {{based on a}} skin in the World Museum Liverpool, specimen D.1792, which was labelled as coming from Madagascar. He suggested that this <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> bird mentioned by Tafforet, instead of N. rodericanus from mainland Rodrigues. Walter Rothschild, however, believed the Liverpool specimen to be an albinistic specimen of a Necropsar species supposedly from Mauritius. In 1953, Japanese writer Masauji Hachisuka suggested that N. leguati was distinct enough to warrant its own genus, Orphanopsar. In a 2005 DNA analysis, the specimen was eventually identified as an albinistic specimen of the grey trembler (Cinclocerthia gutturalis) from Martinique.|$|E

5|$|Jordan Nagai as Russell. Throughout {{most of the}} film, {{he makes}} several {{comments}} to Carl that suggest that Russell's father and mother are no longer together. Russell's design was based on Pixar animator Peter Sohn. Docter auditioned 400 boys in a nationwide casting call for the part. Nagai, who is Japanese American, showed up to an audition with his brother, who <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> one auditioning. Docter realized Nagai behaved and spoke non-stop like Russell and chose him for the part. Nagai {{was eight years old}} when cast. Docter encouraged Nagai to act physically as well as vocally when recording the role, lifting him upside down and tickling him for the scene where Russell encounters Kevin. Asian Americans have positively noted Pixar's first casting of an Asian lead character, in contrast to the common practice of casting non-Asians in Asian parts.|$|E
5|$|On November 22, 2014, UCLA {{announced}} that it would officially retire the number 42 across all university sports, effective immediately. While Robinson wore several different numbers during his UCLA career, the school chose 42 because it had become indelibly identified with him. The only sport this did not affect was men's basketball, which had previously retired the number for Walt Hazzard (although Kevin Love <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> last player in that sport to wear 42, with Hazzard's blessing). In a move paralleling that of MLB when it retired the number, UCLA allowed three athletes (in women's soccer, softball, and football) who were already wearing 42 to continue to do so for the remainder of their UCLA careers. The school also announced it would prominently display the number at all of its athletic venues.|$|E
5|$|Opponents of dam removal {{state that}} the {{estimated}} demolition cost of $3–10 billion is a poor investment, especially in regards of the resulting loss of renewable hydroelectric power, which {{would have to be}} replaced by polluting fossil fuel generation. Although there are several options available to replace San Francisco's water, none are of the purity currently supplied by Hetch Hetchy. There is also no guarantee that the valley can be successfully restored, as the original valley floor <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>the</b> product of thousands of years of intensive controlled burning and management by the native Paiute and Miwok peoples that once lived in the area. Without this intervention, a forest would grow in the place of the valley's renowned meadows. Finally, the increased pressure of new tourism could cause its own environmental damage, as has been demonstrated in the crowded Yosemite Valley.|$|E
