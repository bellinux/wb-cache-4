5|$|Alternatively, Dawn Landua-McCormack {{suggested}} that the Southern South Saqqara pyramid {{could have been a}} candidate for Neferhotep's burial site. This pyramid, datable to the middle 13th Dynasty, was provided with two elaborate sarcophagus chambers <b>which</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been destined for two wealthy brother kings of the dynasty such as Neferhotep I and Sobekhotep IV.|$|E
5|$|General Pigot was harshly criticise by Clinton {{for failing}} to await the relief force, <b>which</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> {{successfully}} entrapped the Americans on the island.

5|$|At {{the eastern}} side of the pyramid, the {{remnants}} of brick walls could indicate the presence of a mortuary temple, but the archaeological traces are so tenuous that any closer examination and more precise reconstruction is impossible today. The same goes for the ruins of a building several hundred metres away from the pyramid, and <b>which</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been the valley temple. If this was indeed a valley temple, its east-west orientation would be unique in all pyramid complexes.|$|E

5|$|Believing {{that the}} wings were short and round, Gibbs thought {{the bird was}} not a strong flyer, and {{therefore}} not nomadic (periodically moving from place to place). In spite of the evidently longer wings <b>which</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> made it a strong flyer, vanGrouw also thought {{it would have been}} a sedentary (mostly staying at the same location) bird, that preferred not to fly across open water, similar to species in Ducula. It may have had a limited distribution on a small, remote island, which may explain why its provenance remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|The Deccan Traps {{could have}} caused {{extinction}} through several mechanisms, including the release of dust and sulfuric aerosols into the air, <b>which</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions that increased the greenhouse effect when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the siege}} {{consumed}} {{a large part}} of the Caliphate's manpower and resources, it was still capable of launching raids against the Byzantine frontier in eastern Asia Minor during the siege's duration: in 717, Caliph Sulayman's son Daud captured a fortress near Melitene and in 718 Amr ibn Qais raided the frontier. On the Byzantine side, the numbers are unknown. Aside from Anastasius II's preparations (<b>which</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been neglected following his deposition), the Byzantines could count on the assistance of the Bulgars, with whom Leo concluded a treaty that possibly included alliance against the Arabs.|$|E

5|$|As {{pointed out}} by Jack Bailey (1997), the spines resembled those of sail-bearing pelycosaurs like Dimetrodon. According to Bailey, Amargasaurus might also have possessed such a sail, <b>which</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been used for display. Unlike those of pelycosaurs, the neural spines of Amargasaurus were bifurcated, forming a double row along the neck and back. As the space between both rows was merely , the {{existence}} of two parallel sails seems unlikely. Instead, Bailey suggested the spines represented a scaffold which was completely enveloped by a single skin. Paul argued against the sail hypothesis, noting that neck sails would have reduced neck flexion, and that the spines were circular in cross-section rather than flattened {{as is the case}} in sail-bearing animals.|$|E
5|$|As the Union army approached, Lee {{chose to}} make a stand at Sharpsburg, Maryland along Antietam Creek. On September 17, 1862, the armies engaged in the Battle of Antietam. The V Corps was held in reserve {{in the center of}} Union lines during the battle. The 22nd had a clear view of both flanks of the Union army and watched the assaults that took place {{over the course of the}} day. The V Corps, however, took no part in these assaults. Historians have criticized McClellan for his uncoordinated attacks at Antietam and for not {{committing}} the V Corps <b>which</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> broken Lee's army.|$|E
5|$|Basing {{himself on}} revised data, Sampson in 1995 {{estimated}} that the layers investigated represented {{a longer period of}} time than the initially assumed 500,000 years: after the deposition of Gilmore's Brachyceratops quarry, 860,000 years would have passed, and after the Einiosaurus beds 640,000 years, until the maximal extent of the Bearpaw transgression. He did not adopt Horner's hypothesis of anagenesis but assumed speciation took place, with the populations splitting. These time intervals were still short enough to indicate that the rate of speciation must have been high, <b>which</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been true of all centrosaurines of the late Campanian.|$|E

The breeding stock {{was taken from}} Piber in 1942, and additional mares and foals from other European nations arrived in 1943. The stallions of the Spanish Riding School were evacuated to St. Martins, Austria from Vienna in January 1945, when bombing raids neared {{the city and the}} head of the Spanish Riding School, Colonel Alois Podhajsky, feared the horses were in danger. By spring of 1945, the horses at Hostau were threatened by the advancing Soviet army, <b>which</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> slaughtered the animals for horse meat had it captured the facility.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Charles {{apparently}} conquered {{his physical}} infirmity, <b>which</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> {{been caused by}} rickets. He became an adept horseman and marksman, and took up fencing. Even so, his public profile remained low in contrast to that of his physically stronger and taller elder brother, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, whom Charles adored and attempted to emulate. However, in early November 1612, Henry {{died at the age}} of 18 of what is suspected to have been typhoid (or possibly porphyria). Charles, who turned 12 two weeks later, became heir apparent. As the eldest surviving son of the sovereign, Charles automatically gained several titles (including Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay). Four years later, in November 1616, he was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester.|$|E
5|$|In 1992 Michael filed a {{malpractice}} {{suit against}} Terri's obstetrician {{on the basis}} that he failed to diagnose bulimia as the cause of her infertility. Terri had gone to the doctor because she had stopped menstruating but the doctor had failed to take her medical history into account <b>which</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> revealed an eating disorder. During the case, one of Terri's friends testified that she knew Schiavo was bulimic. In November 1992, Michael won the case and was awarded $6.8 million by the jury, later reduced to $2 million as Terri was found partly at fault for her condition. After attorneys' fees and other expenses, Michael received $300,000 and $750,000 was put in a trust fund for Terri's medical care. According to Michael, in early 2003 the Schindlers demanded that he share the malpractice money with them.|$|E

5|$|In {{comparison}} to other contemporary space films, Gravity, facing far less competition, opened to a better-than-expected $55.8 million in 2013. In November 2014, Interstellar debuted to $47.5 million. Unlike Gravity and Interstellar, {{which had the}} benefit of IMAX locations, boosting profits, The Martian was not initially playing in IMAX, since IMAX was committed to an exclusive run of Robert Zemeckis' The Walk. The Martian played in more than 350 premium large-format theaters including 2,550 3D locations. Also, the film was released several days after the announcement of NASA's discovery of water on Mars' planetary surface, <b>which</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> aided in boosting its opening. Ticket selling website Fandango reported that the film was outselling Gravity. Unlike Gravity, The Martian did not contain abundant 3D spectacle (even though it was filmed in 3D), and was longer than Gravity.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{necklaces}} features lion-headed terminals, {{and another}} includes stylized dolphins. The other four are relatively plain loop-in-loop chains, although {{one has a}} Chi-Rho symbol (☧) on the clasp, the only Christian element in the jewellery. Necklaces of similar lengths would normally be worn in the Roman period with a pendant, but no pendants {{were found in the}} hoard. The three rings were originally set with gems, <b>which</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been natural gemstones, or pieces of coloured glass; however, these were taken from the rings before they were buried, perhaps for reuse. The rings are of similar design, one with an oval bezel, one with a circular bezel, and one with a large oblong bezel.|$|E
5|$|The Medway Megaliths can {{be divided}} into two {{separate}} clusters: one {{to the west of the}} River Medway and the other on Blue Bell Hill to the east, with the distance between the two clusters measuring at between 8 and 10 kilometres (5 and 6 miles).

The eastern group consists of Kit's Coty House, Little Kit's Coty House, the Coffin Stone, and several other stones <b>which</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> once been parts of chambered tombs. It is not known if they were all built at the same time, or whether they were constructed in succession, while similarly it is not known if they each served the same function or whether there was a hierarchy in their usage.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} at Llanbadarn Fawr was greatly injured by the Danes in 988, and again (by Gruffydd ab Llewelyn) in 1038. Portions {{of an earlier}} structure were alleged {{to be included in}} the present edifice, which is of early English style. This is, however, unlikely, as stone church construction in Wales has been conventionally dated to the twelfth century and later, and the earlier buildings were probably wooden, although we know that a new tower and porch were built around 1115. Much evidence <b>which</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> shown whether there was any fabric dating from before the thirteenth century reconstruction, and even as far back as late Celtic (or Romano-British) times, was lost with the extensive late-Victorian reconstruction, particularly of the nave, is hidden beneath the present church, or is in the churchyard.|$|E
5|$|The garrisons of the Device Forts {{comprised}} {{relatively small}} teams {{of men who}} typically {{lived and worked in}} the fortifications. The garrisons would maintain and care for the buildings and their artillery during the long periods of peacetime and, in a crisis, would be supplemented by additional soldiers and the local militia. The size of the garrisons varied according to the fortification; Camber Castle had a garrison of 29, Walmer Castle 18, while the West Tilbury Blockhouse only held 9 men. The ordinary soldiers would have lived in relatively basic conditions, typically on the ground floor, with the captains of the fortifications occupying more elaborate quarters, often in the upper levels of the keeps. The soldiers ate meat and fish, some of <b>which</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been hunted or caught by the garrison.|$|E
