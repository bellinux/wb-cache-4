5|$|Guy Fawkes, who {{was born}} and educated in York, {{was a member of}} a group of Roman Catholic restorationists that planned the Gunpowder Plot. Its aim was to {{displace}} Protestant rule by blowing up the Houses of Parliament while King James I, the entire Protestant, and even most of the Catholic aristocracy and nobility <b>were</b> <b>inside.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 50th anniversary Conventicle of the Boys' Brigade, {{which had}} been founded in Glasgow by William Alexander Smith, was staged at Hampden in 1933. 130,000 people <b>were</b> <b>inside</b> the ground, while another 100,000 stood outside singing Psalms.|$|E

60|$|It {{certainly}} is queer {{what a difference}} there <b>is</b> between being <b>inside</b> and outside. Sometimes happiness <b>is</b> <b>inside</b> and sometimes it is outside. Sometimes the one who <b>is</b> <b>inside</b> wishes {{with all his might}} that he were outside, and sometimes the one who is outside would give anything in the world to <b>be</b> <b>inside.</b>|$|R

5|$|Cornerback Fernando Bryant led the team's pass defense. He {{finished}} {{the season with}} 51 tackles and two interceptions. He was supported by strong safety Marcus Spencer, who led the Crimson Tide in interceptions with four. Alabama's sole All-Southeastern Conference selection was punter Daniel Pope, a senior who averaged a school-record 44 yards per kick {{during the regular season}} and was second nationally in net punting at 40.8 yards per kick. Of his 60 punts, 20 <b>were</b> <b>inside</b> the opponents' 20-yard line. None were blocked.|$|E
5|$|Henry II visited York Castle {{four times}} during his reign. The royal {{chambers}} {{at the time}} <b>were</b> <b>inside</b> the keep for safety, and Henry paid £15 for repairs to the keep. During his 1175 visit, Henry used the castle as the base for receiving the homage of William the Lion of Scotland. Castle mills were built close by to support the garrison, and the military order of the Knights Templar was granted ownership of the mills in the mid-12th century. The mills proved to be vulnerable to the flooding of the two rivers {{and had to be}} repeatedly repaired.|$|E
5|$|Music with a fast {{rhythm of}} 120 bpm {{was used in}} an attempt to keep the teams walking quickly around the stadium, and this was {{reinforced}} by the drummers in the stadium; nevertheless the parade part of the programme took 1 hour 40 minutes to complete, compared to the 1 hour 29 minutes estimated in the official media guide.

5|$|According to {{production}} staff, scenes involving the alien queen {{were the most}} difficult to film. A life-sized mock-up was created by Stan Winston's company in the United States to see how it would operate. Once the testing was complete, the crew working on the queen flew to England and began work creating the final version. Standing at 14 feet (4.3 m) tall, it was operated using a mixture of puppeteers, control rods, hydraulics, cables, and a crane above to support it. Two puppeteers <b>were</b> <b>inside</b> the suit operating its arms, and 16 were required to move it. All sequences involving the full size queen were filmed in-camera with no post-production manipulation. Additionally, a miniature alien queen was used for certain shots.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 646people <b>were</b> <b>inside</b> {{the building}} when the bomb exploded. By {{the end of}} the day, 14 adults and 6 children were confirmed dead, and over 100 injured. The toll eventually reached 168confirmed dead, not including an unmatched left leg that could have belonged to an unidentified 169th victim or could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg. Most of the deaths resulted from the collapse of the building, rather than the bomb blast itself. Those killed included 163 who were in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, one person in the Athenian Building, one woman in a parking lot across the street, a man and woman in the Oklahoma Water Resources building, and a rescue worker struck on the head by debris.|$|E
5|$|At 8:00pm the Japanese {{sent two}} Type 95 tanks with bright {{headlights}} into the plantation. The {{men from the}} 2/10th tried to disable them with sticky bombs, but due to the humid conditions the bombs failed {{to adhere to the}} Japanese armour. In the fighting that followed over the course of two and a half hours, the Australians suffered heavy casualties. Receiving indirect fire support from the 2/5th Field Regiment's 25 pounder guns situated near Gili Gili, they repelled four frontal attacks. However, by midnight the Japanese <b>were</b> <b>inside</b> the Australian position and in the confusion the 2/10th withdrew in some disorder to a number of scattered positions on {{the west bank of the}} Gama, which they reached by about 2:00am on 28 August. A further assault, however, by tank-mounted infantry forced them back further, moving back through the 61st and 25th Infantry Battalions towards No. 3 Airstrip, which was still under construction, south of Kilarbo. During the brief engagement around KB Mission, they had lost 43 men killed and another 26 wounded.|$|E

30|$|The {{procedure}} {{was similar to}} that in Experiment 2, with the following exceptions. Observers were shown 16 pictures. For each, they were asked whether a specific object <b>was</b> <b>inside</b> and selected one of the following answer choices and then indicated their confidence: (1) yes, the object <b>is</b> <b>inside</b> and I can use the bar to show you where it is; (2) yes, the object <b>is</b> <b>inside</b> but from the picture I cannot tell where it is; (3) from the picture I cannot tell whether the object is inside; or (4) no, the object <b>is</b> not <b>inside.</b> If Choice 1 was selected, they used the bar with inclinometer to indicate the location of the object. After they had made their selections for all pictures, they were told that the object <b>was</b> <b>inside</b> and asked to guess about the location by orienting the bar.|$|R

5|$|During the night, Pyrrhus {{was able}} to enter Argos. While Pausanias recounts that he did so by force, Plutarch asserts that Diamperes Gate had been left open for the Epiriotes by Aristeas. Hammond opines {{that it is more}} likely that Aristeas {{admitted}} Pyrrhus into the city. Although Pyrrhus' Gauls were able to occupy the Argive agora, the rest of the army was delayed due to the war elephants being too large to pass through the gate. In order for them to enter, the towers need to be taken off their backs and reattached once they <b>were</b> <b>inside</b> the city. Furthermore, Pyrrhus left the majority of his army outside the city walls under the command of his son Helenus. This delay gave the Argives enough time to reach their citadel, the Aspis, and seek aid from Antigonus. The Macedonian king responded immediately, advancing towards the city walls and sending a relief force inside under the command of his son Halcyoneus.|$|E
5|$|From then on, Kouao kept Climbié {{away from}} hospitals, turning instead to churches. Kouao {{said to the}} pastors {{that she was the}} mother and that demons <b>were</b> <b>inside</b> Climbié. The pastor at the Mission Ensemble Pour Christ, Pascal Orome, offered prayers for Climbié to cast out the devil, and thought that her {{injuries}} were due to demonic possession. On another occasion, Kouao took Climbié to a church run by the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, where the pastor, Alvaro Lima, suspected she was being abused, although he took no action. He said in the inquiry that Climbié told him that Satan had told her to burn herself. The pastor did not believe her, but he still believed that a person could be possessed.|$|E
5|$|Major Kean {{returned}} to {{the ground floor of}} the Chancery and ordered his men to withdraw into a large semicircle at the main entrance to the Chancery. Most of the Marines <b>were</b> <b>inside</b> the Chancery when the crowds outside the Embassy broke through the gates into the compound. The Marines closed and bolted the Chancery door, the elevators were locked by Seabees on the sixth floor and the Marines withdrew up the stairwells locking grill gates behind them. On the ground floor a water tanker was driven through the Chancery door and the crowd began to surge up through the building toward the rooftop. The Marines on the rooftop had sealed the doors and were using Mace to discourage the crowd from trying to break through. Sporadic gunfire from around the Embassy passed over the rooftop.|$|E

5|$|The {{infantry}} {{scrambled to}} their feet and rushed forward while the sappers hurried to break down the sides of the antitank ditch with picks and shovels. They advanced on a series of posts held by the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Italian 115th Infantry Regiment. Posts 49 and 47 were rapidly overrun, as was Post 46 in the second line beyond. Within half an hour Post 48 had also fallen and another company had taken Posts 45 and 44. The two remaining companies now advanced beyond these positions towards a low stone wall as artillery fire began to fall along the broken wire. The Italians fought from behind the wall until the Australians <b>were</b> <b>inside</b> it, attacking with hand grenades and bayonets. The two companies succeeded in taking 400 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Across {{the army}} {{boundary}} on the right, the ROK 1st Division continued its attack northwest and {{advanced to the}} edge of Ka-san. The ROK 11th Regiment seized Hill 755 about dark on September 14, and small elements of the ROK 15th Regiment reached the stone ramparts of the Ka-san area at the same time. The ROK and North Korean troops fought during the night and on into the 15th at many points along the high mountain backbone that extends southeast from Ka-san to Hills 755 and 783 and on to P'algong-san. Prisoners taken by the ROK's estimated that there were about 800 North Koreans on this high ridge. The ROK 1st Division later estimated that approximately 3,000 North Koreans <b>were</b> <b>inside</b> Ka-san's walled perimeter and about 1,500 or 2,000 outside it near the crest. At this time the bulk of the NK 1st Division was gradually withdrawing into Ka-san and its vicinity. Indications were that the NK 13th Division also was withdrawing northward. Aerial observers on the afternoon of September 14 reported that an estimated 500 North Korean troops were moving north from Tabu-dong. While these signs were hopeful, Walker continued to prepare for a final close-in defense of Taegu. As part of this, fourteen battalions of South Korean police dug in around the city.|$|E
