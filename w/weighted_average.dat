The <b>weighted</b> <b>averaged</b> shear stresses representing friction forces are defined in terms of the <b>weighted</b> <b>averaged</b> velocities.

30|$|In this paper, we have {{developed}} the notion of interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy Einstein hybrid <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> aggregation operator along with their some desirable properties such as idempotency, boundedness, and monotonicity. Actually interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy Einstein <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> aggregation operator weights only the Pythagorean fuzzy arguments and interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy Einstein ordered <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> aggregation operator weights only the ordered positions of the Pythagorean fuzzy arguments instead of weighting the Pythagorean fuzzy arguments themselves. To overcome these limitations, we have introduced an interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy Einstein hybrid <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> aggregation operator, which weights both the given Pythagorean fuzzy value and its ordered position. Finally, the proposed operator {{has been applied to}} decision-making problems to show the validity, practicality and effectiveness of the new approach.|$|R

40|$|When using {{linguistic}} {{approaches to}} solve decision problems, we need linguistic representation models. The symbolic model, the 2 -tuple fuzzy linguistic representation {{model and the}} continuous linguistic model are three existing linguistic representation models based on position indexes. Together with these three linguistic models, the corresponding ordered <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> operators, such as the linguistic ordered <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> operator, the 2 -tuple ordered <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> operator and the extended ordered <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> operator, have been developed, respectively. In this paper, we analyze the internal relationship among these operators, and propose a consensus operator under the continuous linguistic model (or the 2 -tuple fuzzy linguistic representation model). The proposed consensus operator {{is based on the}} use of the ordered <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> operator and the deviation measures. Some desired properties of the consensus operator are also presented. In particular, the consensus operator provides an alternative consensus model for group decision making. This consensus model preserves the original preference information given by the decision makers as much as possible, and supports consensus process automatically, without moderator.

5|$|Following the Smithsonian Agreement, {{member states}} of the European Economic Community adopted a {{narrower}} currency band of 1.125% for exchange rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the snake in the tunnel. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the European Currency Unit (ECU), an artificial <b>weighted</b> <b>average</b> market basket of European Union members' currencies, and the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies' par values. The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value. The central exchange rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation. During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we look at}} the {{classical}} problem of aggregating individual utilities and study social orderings which are based on the concept of Ordered <b>Weighted</b> <b>Averaging</b> Aggregation Operator. In these social orderings, called Ordered <b>Weighted</b> <b>Averaging</b> Social Welfare Functions, weights are assigned a priori to the positions in the social ranking and, for every possible alternative, the total welfare is calculated as a weighted sum in which the weight corresponding to the kth position multiplies the utility in the kth position. In the α-Ordered <b>Weighted</b> <b>Averaging</b> Social Welfare Function, the utility in the kth position is the kth smallest value assumed by the utility functions, whereas in the β-Ordered <b>Weighted</b> <b>Averaging</b> Social Welfare Function it is the utility of the kth poorest individual.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze different methods for decision making, with a focus on entrepreneurship in Latin America.

The paper presents a new generalized probabilistic <b>weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> (GPWA) operator that unifies WAs and probability in the same formulation, considering the degree of importance of each concept used in the analysis.
