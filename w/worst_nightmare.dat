25|$|The 1961 Stanley Cup Finals {{were almost}} not {{televised}} in Canada at all. At that time, the CBC only had {{rights to the}} Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs' games; home games only during the season and all games in the playoffs. However, with both the Canadiens and Maple Leafs eliminated in the semi-finals, the CBC's <b>worst</b> <b>nightmare</b> became reality. The CBC had to conceive a way to carry the Finals between the Chicago Black Hawks and Detroit Red Wings or face public revolt. According to lore, the CBC {{found a way to}} link their Windsor viewers as having a vested interest in the Finals with the across the river Red Wings. Thus, CBC was able to carry the series after inking special contracts with the Red Wings and Black Hawks as a service to the Windsor market. From Windsor, CBC linked the signal to Toronto and they relayed the coverage Dominion-wide. From there, Canadians were able to see the Finals with nary a glitch in the coverage.|$|E

500|$|The major fictional {{representations}} to date {{have largely}} portrayed jury consultants as villains that are highly effective at influencing the jury, often using illegal tactics that mainstream practitioners do not use. Consultants are major characters in John Grisham's novel The Runaway Jury and the similar film adaptation. In the film, Rankin Fitch, [...] "jury consultant for the defense", leads a team that uses high technology and sometimes-illegal tactics to prevent a judgment against their corporate client in what Salon calls [...] "our <b>worst</b> <b>nightmare</b> of corporate arm-twisting". Writing about the book, Kressel and Kressel say Grisham [...] "plays on fears that the American justice system has been hijacked by crafty attorneys and immensely effective hired-gun social scientists". Jean Hanff Korelitz's A Jury of Her Peers stretches the known reality of consulting much further. Korelitz's fictional consultants {{are part of an}} unscrupulous firm that charges prosecutors to kidnap homeless people, program them with drugs into conviction-only jurors, and substitute them for those hoping to avoid jury duty. Jonakait says the novel is [...] "hardly realistic" [...] but [...] "reveals the distrust engendered by jury consultants".|$|E
500|$|The band {{have usually}} been {{categorized}} under the indie rock, garage rock and post-punk revival genres. A {{key part of}} their sound, and one that translates across their whole discography, is lead singer and frontman Alex Turner's intricate and often rapidly delivered lyrics, sung in a distinctive strong Sheffield accent that their music became famed for in their early years. A large part of their iconic British sound is credited to the punk poet John Cooper Clarke from whom the Arctic Monkeys even borrowed lyrics and the title from in [...] "I Wanna Be Yours". Turner adapted Clarke's method of delivery mostly in their first album, Whatever People Say I Am That's What I'm Not. Their early albums Whatever People Say I Am That's What I'm Not and Favourite <b>Worst</b> <b>Nightmare</b> were rooted in garage rock and post-punk revival, with Turner's sharp lyrics the focal point. On the first album Alex Turner examined human behaviour in nightclubs and {{in the culture of}} the band's hometown, Sheffield. Turner describes [...] "Dancing Shoes" [...] as being about [...] "people always looking to [...] when they go out however much they mask it." ...|$|E

500|$|Shiamak Davar choreographed {{the dance}} {{sequence}} of [...] "Bum Bum Bole," [...] {{and was given}} free rein over its design. He had intended to use 40students from his dance school, but Khan did not want trained dancers.

Time constraints meant that while Khan was busy filming [...] "Bum Bum Bole," [...] Ram Madhvani took over as director for [...] "Bheja Kum".

It was intended to represent [...] "a young boy's <b>worst</b> <b>nightmare,</b> in terms of... the worst thing that he can think of"; Madhvani based the visual concept on his son's fear of [...] "creepy-crawlies" [...] such as cockroaches, dragonflies, and lizards. Tata Elxsi's Visual Computing Labs made the creatures out of the English alphabet and numbers, although Khan insisted they include the Hindi alphabet as not all the audience would be familiar with English.

500|$|Bobby {{explains}} {{that the man who}} attacked Sam is Jeremy Frost; he was unable to dream because his father brutally hit him {{in the head with a}} baseball bat. The target's DNA is a required ingredient for the dream-root tea, and Jeremy acquired Bobby's by offering him a beer. Dean realizes that he made the same mistake. Vulnerable to Jeremy, they both stay awake for two days while attempting to track him down. Unable to endure it any longer, Dean goes to sleep to face Jeremy, and Sam uses the dream root to enter his dream. The brothers encounter a dream version of Lisa Braeden (Cindy Sampson)Dean's former love interestoutside on a blanket with a picnic basket. She invites Dean to join her, and tells him that she loves him before disappearing. Though Dean denies ever having that dream before, it is an obvious lie. Sam then sees Jeremy nearby and chases after him, and Dean finds himself in a long hallway. He enters his motel room, and comes face-to-face with a dream version of him; he is his own <b>worst</b> <b>nightmare.</b> The Dream Dean comments on the real Dean's feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing; he also deems Dean to be as [...] "mindless and obedient as an attack dog", noting that his possessions, personality, and motives all stem from his father. When the Dream Dean calls him a [...] "good soldier and nothing else", the real Dean reacts violently and exclaims that he did not deserve the burdens that his father put onto him and that he does not deserve to go to Hell. The real Dean shoots his doppelganger with a shotgun, but he returns to life as a demon. The Dream Dean taunts him that he cannot escape his fate, and reminds him that exposure to Hell will transform him into a demon.|$|E
