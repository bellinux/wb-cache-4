5|$|Lysosomes are organelles {{that contain}} hydrolytic enzymes {{that are used}} for {{intracellular}} digestion. The main functions of a lysosome are to process molecules taken in by the cell and to recycle worn out cell parts. The enzymes inside of lysosomes are acid hydrolases <b>which</b> <b>require</b> an acidic environment for optimal performance. Lysosomes provide such an environment by maintaining a pH of 5.0 inside of the organelle. If a lysosome were to rupture, the enzymes released would not be very active because of the cytosol's neutral pH. However, if numerous lysosomes leaked the cell could be destroyed from autodigestion.|$|E
5|$|Many corals in {{the order}} Scleractinia are hermatypic, meaning that they are {{involved}} in building reefs. Most such corals obtain some of their energy from zooxanthellae in the genus Symbiodinium. These are symbiotic photosynthetic dinoflagellates <b>which</b> <b>require</b> sunlight; reef-forming corals are therefore found mainly in shallow water. They secrete calcium carbonate to form hard skeletons that become the framework of the reef. However, not all reef-building corals in shallow water contain zooxanthellae, and some deep water species, living at depths to which light cannot penetrate, form reefs but do not harbour the symbionts.|$|E
5|$|Many small {{communities}} obtain their drinking water from diverse sources (lakes, streams, springs and groundwater wells). Levels of treatment vary widely, from rudimentary systems with coarse screening or settling followed by disinfection (usually chlorination), to more sophisticated systems using a filtration step. It {{should be noted}} that unless a high quality source is used, such as secure groundwater, disinfection alone is unlikely to guarantee that drinking water is safe from protozoa such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium, which are relatively resistant to standard disinfectants and <b>which</b> <b>require</b> additional removal steps such as filtration.|$|E

5|$|Other natural {{patterns}} {{occur in}} foams; these are packed according to Plateau's laws, <b>which</b> <b>require</b> minimal surfaces. Such foams present {{a problem in}} how to pack cells as tightly as possible: in 1887, Lord Kelvin proposed a packing using only one solid, the bitruncated cubic honeycomb with very slightly curved faces. In 1993, Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan proposed the Weaire–Phelan structure, which uses less surface area to separate cells of equal volume than Kelvin's foam.|$|E
5|$|Propagation is by seed or cuttings. Seeds do {{not require}} any treatment, and take 14 to 49 days to germinate. In the absence of further {{information}} specific to B.epica, George recommends that cultivated plants be treated as for B.media and B.praemorsa, both of <b>which</b> <b>require</b> a sunny position in well drained soil, and tolerate only light pruning not below the green foliage.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of wind power capacity in South Australia has been encouraged {{by a number}} of factors. These include the Australian Government's Renewable Energy Target, <b>which</b> <b>require</b> electricity retailers to source a proportion of energy from renewable sources, incentives from the South Australian Government including a supportive regulatory regime and a payroll tax rebate scheme for large scale renewable energy developments. Also the state's proximity to the Roaring forties means there are high quality wind resources for wind farms to exploit. In mid-2009, RenewablesSA was established by the South Australian Government to encourage further investment in renewable energy in the state.|$|E

These dungeons often have treasure chests containing rare items that are not available in most stores. Some dungeons feature puzzles and mazes, <b>which</b> <b>require</b> the player to divide the characters into multiple parties.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} {{works in}} concert with the state legislature (the bicameral Indiana General Assembly, consisting of the Indiana House of Representatives and the Indiana Senate) and the state supreme court (the Supreme Court of Indiana) to govern the state. The governor has the power to veto legislation passed by the General Assembly. If vetoed, a bill is returned to the General Assembly for reconsideration. Unlike other states, most of <b>which</b> <b>require</b> a two-thirds supermajority to override a veto, the Indiana General Assembly may override the veto with an absolute majority vote in both chambers.|$|E
