5|$|Hubert Humphrey got {{his start}} in Minnesota {{politics}} in the early 1940s. He was an organizer of the Minnesota Democratic Party at the time, {{and he realized that}} the party's best chance of success would come if the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party merged <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> party. Other party leaders had been discussing the merger, but Humphrey's idea was to keep the Farmer-Labor name {{in the name of the}} merged party, in order to gain the strength of thousands of loyal voters. Thus, the party got the name Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{never gave}} up on a return to public service. He ran an {{unsuccessful}} campaign for the U.S. Senate against John J. Crittenden in 1842. He briefly and futilely sought his party's nomination for president in 1844. He also ran as an independent candidate for Governor of Kentucky in 1848, but after talking <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> candidate, Lazarus W. Powell, who had replaced Linn Boyd on the ticket, Johnson decided to drop out and back Powell. Some speculated that the real object of this campaign was to secure another nomination to the vice-presidency, but this hope was denied.|$|E
5|$|Parker {{also became}} active <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party {{and was an}} early {{supporter}} of future New York governor and US President Grover Cleveland.

5|$|After the war Helm {{identified}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party, and {{he returned}} to the state senate in 1865. During his tenure he chaired the Committee on Federal Relations and fought against punitive and restrictive laws against ex-Confederates. On January 22, 1866 he presented to the state senate a protest against the actions of the United States Congress during the Civil War. It denounced the Reconstruction Amendments {{on the grounds that they}} granted powers to the federal government that were reserved for the states, and that they were passed while many southern states were not represented in Congress. He also decried the creation and operation of the Freedmen's Bureau. On January 29, 1867, Helm introduced legislation to organize a meeting in Louisville to rally support for President Andrew Johnson and his efforts to restore the Union.|$|E
5|$|Although he openly opposed secession {{during the}} American Civil War, federal {{military}} forces labeled Helm a Confederate sympathizer. In September 1862, {{he was arrested}} for this alleged sympathy, but Governor James F. Robinson recognized him as he was being transported to a prison in Louisville and had him released. After the war Helm identified <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party, and in 1865 Hardin County voters returned him to the state senate. In 1867 he was the state's Democratic candidate for governor. Despite his failing health, Helm made a vigorous canvass of the state and won the general election. He was too weak to travel to Frankfort for his inauguration, so state officials administered the oath of office at his home on September 3, 1867. He died five days later.|$|E
5|$|Clements {{began his}} {{campaign}} for re-election in 1956 by defeating Joe Bates, the candidate favored by Chandler, in the Democratic senatorial primary. On April 30, 1956, Kentucky senator Alben Barkley died suddenly of a heart attack. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> primary already over, the Democratic State Central Committee was charged with selecting a candidate to run for Barkley's seat. They chose Wetherby, Clements' former lieutenant governor. Journalist John Ed Pearce later recorded that Clements had favored Chandler's choice, Joseph Leary, as a candidate rather than Wetherby. Clements didn't think Leary {{had a very good}} chance of winning, but he felt Leary's selection would keep Chandler from throwing his support to the Republican candidates.|$|E

5|$|From his {{earliest}} involvement in politics, Cleveland aligned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party. He had a decided aversion to Republicans John Fremont and Abraham Lincoln, and {{the heads of}} the Rogers law firm were solid Democrats. In 1865, he ran for District Attorney, losing narrowly to his friend and roommate, Lyman K. Bass, the Republican nominee. In 1870, with the help of friend Oscar Folsom, Cleveland secured the Democratic nomination for Sheriff of Erie County, New York. He won the election by a 303-vote margin and took office on January 1, 1871 at age 33. While this new career took him away from the practice of law, it was rewarding in other ways: the fees were said to yield up to $40,000 (US$ today) over the two-year term.|$|E
5|$|In the 1880s, Tillman, {{a wealthy}} landowner, became {{dissatisfied}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> leadership and led {{a movement of}} white farmers calling for reform. He was initially unsuccessful, though he {{was instrumental in the}} founding of Clemson University as an agricultural school. In 1890, Tillman took control of the state Democratic Party, and was elected governor. During his four years in office, 18 African Americans were lynched in South Carolina—the 1890s saw the most lynchings of any decade in South Carolina. Tillman tried to prevent lynchings, but spoke in support of the lynch mobs, stating his own willingness to lead one. In 1894, {{at the end of his}} second two-year term, he was elected to the U.S. Senate by vote of the state legislature.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer {{found himself}} at odds <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> {{organization}} on some occasions, most prominently on {{amendments to the}} city charter. In 1956, charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections were proposed. Sawyer had campaigned against the idea and refused {{to go along with}} them. Even without his support, the amendments found the required two-thirds vote in Council to make it on to the ballot for popular approval. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down some of the amendments, and the rest failed in a referendum that April. Such disagreements led the Democratic City Committee to withhold their endorsement of Sawyer for a second term in 1959, and he retired from elected office to return to his law practice. In 1965, while serving as president of the southeastern Pennsylvania chapter of the Americans for Democratic Action, Sawyer led a group of Democrats who endorsed Republican Arlen Specter for district attorney of Philadelphia.|$|E

5|$|The Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) is the {{national}} army of Rwanda. Largely composed of former Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) soldiers, it includes the Rwanda Land Force, Rwanda Air Force and specialised units. After the successful conquest {{of the country in}} 1994 {{in the aftermath of the}} Rwandan Genocide, the Rwandan Patriotic Front decided to split the RPF into a political division (which retained the RPF name) and the RDF, a military division which was to serve as the official army of the Rwandan state. Defence spending continues to represent an important share of {{the national}} budget, largely due to continuing security problems along the frontiers <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> Republic of the Congo and Burundi and lingering concerns about Uganda's intentions towards its former ally. In 2010, the United Nations released a report accusing the Rwandan army of committing wide scale human rights violations and crimes against humanity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the First and Second Congo Wars, charges denied by the Rwandan government.|$|E
5|$|The {{legislative}} branch {{consists of a}} unicameral National Assembly of 193members who are elected every five years, and although the Malawian constitution provides for a Senate of 80seats, one {{does not exist in}} practice. If created, the Senate would provide representation for traditional leaders and a variety of geographic districts, as well as special interest groups including the disabled, youth and women. There are currently nine political parties, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> Progressive Party acting as the ruling party and the Malawi Congress Party and the United Democratic Front acting as the main opposition parties in the National Assembly. Suffrage is universal at 18 years of age, and the central government budget for 2009/2010 is $1.7billion.|$|E
5|$|By enfranchising racial minorities, the Act {{facilitated}} {{a political}} realignment of the Democratic and Republican parties. Between 1890 and 1965, minority disenfranchisement allowed conservative Southern Democrats to dominate Southern politics. After Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Act into law, newly enfranchised racial minorities began {{to vote for}} liberal Democratic candidates throughout the South, and Southern white conservatives began to switch their party registration from Democrat to Republican en masse. These dual trends caused the two parties to ideologically polarize, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party becoming more liberal and the Republican Party becoming more conservative. The trends also created competition between the two parties, which Republicans capitalized on by implementing the Southern strategy. Over the subsequent decades, the creation of majority-minority districts to remedy racial vote dilution claims also contributed to these developments. By packing liberal-leaning racial minorities into small numbers of majority-minority districts, large numbers of surrounding districts became more solidly white, conservative, and Republican. While this increased the elected representation of racial minorities as intended, it also decreased white Democratic representation and increased the representation of Republicans overall. By the mid-1990s, these trends culminated in a political realignment: the Democratic Party and the Republican Party became more ideologically polarized and defined as liberal and conservative parties, respectively; and both parties came to compete for electoral success in the South, with the Republican Party controlling most of Southern politics.|$|E
