5|$|About a {{month before}} the race took place, in February 2015, the race organisers {{published}} a publicity poster for the race. This poster showed a <b>woman,</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> dress raised and underwear with the race logo visible. A cyclist's gloved hand was reaching out apparently to pinch the woman's bottom. The poster bore the caption Wie knijpt ze in Harelbeke? ("Who squeezes them in Harelbeke?"). This was a reference to Peter Sagan's actions after the 2013 Tour of Flanders, when he pinched the bottom of Maja Leye during the podium ceremony after the race.|$|E
5|$|Etty was {{a regular}} attender at the Royal Academy's life class {{throughout}} his career. Nyssia stands in a pose which Etty had sketched many times, that of a <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> knee on a raised plinth and one arm raised holding a hanging rope. (Throughout his career Etty had difficulty painting arms, and generally showed his subjects holding their arms away from their body to expose as much of their torso as possible.) It is possible that Etty intentionally chose the obscure subject of the painting as a pretext to paint a woman in this pose. As with many Etty works the female figure has a far better finish {{than the rest of}} the canvas, and it is likely Etty painted Nyssia directly from a life model, completing the rest of the composition later in a studio.|$|E

25|$|Soon after Pawnee {{lost its}} {{function}} as capital, in September 1855, Jefferson Davis, the Secretary of War, surveyed the settlement {{and showed the}} results to U.S. President Franklin Pierce. On the resulting map, the survey indicated the eastern boundary of Fort Riley both with and without Pawnee, and the lines excluding the town were accepted. It was ordered to be destroyed and its land reincorporated back into Fort Riley. Notices signed by Pierce were posted on every structure instructing everyone to leave by October 10. A Major Cook with 1,000 of his Texas troops were charged with evacuating the residents, {{many of whom were}} unwilling to leave. By the night of the 10th, some residents still remained. The Governor's Mansion, abandoned by its first tenant who unhappily left for Shawnee, was pulled down with its next residents still inside. In another home, a <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> infant was carried out on a mattress and taken across the border line of the reservation. Most of the buildings, including all of its houses, were demolished, meaning financial ruin for many families. Other Kansas towns developed under similar circumstances but lacking significant free-state aspirants did not suffer the same fate.|$|E
500|$|Averaging {{a murder}} every ten minutes, Tenebrae ranks {{as one of}} Argento's bloodiest films. In the United Kingdom, the film was shorn of five seconds of [...] "sexualized violence" [...] by the British Board of Film Classification prior to its {{theatrical}} release, on 19 May 1983. The advertising campaign for Tenebrae featured posters and a soundtrack sleeve depicting a <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> throat cut, blood dripping from the wound. According to Jones, who worked for Tenebraes distributor at the time, in the UK the posters had to be recalled after the London Underground refused to run them. New posters were issued that replaced the image of the wound and blood with a red ribbon. A similar change was made to the soundtrack sleeve.|$|E

40|$|Aim Trastuzumab {{was first}} funded in New Zealand {{for use in}} HER 2 +ve stage I–III breast cancer in 2007. This {{observational}} study aims to ascertain the patterns of use of trastuzumab in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> invasive <b>HER</b> 2 +ve breast cancer, and assess the effectiveness of adjuvant trastuzumab in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> stage I–III <b>HER</b> 2 +ve breast cancer. Methods The Waikato and Auckland Breast Cancer Registries have clinical details of 12 372 <b>women</b> diagnosed <b>with</b> invasive breast cancer between June 2000 and May 2013. The proportion of <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>HER</b> 2 +ve breast cancer treated with trastuzumab was examined by age, ethnicity, stage and year of diagnosis. Differences in outcomes including the development of metastases and death were assessed for <b>women</b> <b>with</b> stage I–III <b>HER</b> 2 +ve breast cancer treated with both chemotherapy and trastuzumab, compared to <b>women</b> treated <b>with</b> chemotherapy alone. Results Among the 1587 HER 2 +ve breast cancer patients, 888 (56. 0 %) women received trastuzumab. The probability of having trastuzumab decreased with higher age and comorbidity score and increased with year of diagnosis, tumor size and cancer stage. Māori and Pacific women {{were less likely to}} be treated with trastuzumab. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, the treatment with trastuzumab improved breast cancer-specific mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 0. 57, 95 % CI: 0. 35 – 0. 93). Conclusion Overall, this observational study has shown a substantial improvement in survival for <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>HER</b> 2 +ve stage I–III breast cancer, and much of this improvement can be attributed to the introduction of trastuzumab. Changes in chemotherapy also appear to have led to improved outcomes...|$|R

500|$|Clair {{was created}} for The Cosby Show by series creator, comedian Bill Cosby. Cosby {{originally}} pitched a series about a detective who solves crime using his wit and humor; Clair's earliest incarnation resembled his character's girlfriend, who is depicted as [...] "a strong <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> own career." [...] Networks {{were not interested in}} developing the series, so Cosby opted for a somewhat more autobiographical approach instead. Cosby eventually based The Cosby Show on his stand-up comedy film [...] (1983), which heavily features jokes about his relationship with his wife and their interactions with their children. Clair is based on Cosby's real-life wife Camille. Although the role of the parents in the show evolved dramatically from The Cosby Shows initial inception to final production, the one idea that was retained from Cosby's detective series was the concept of a strong career woman.|$|E
500|$|Shakur {{was convicted}} on all eight counts: two murder charges, and six assault charges. The {{prosecution}} {{did not need}} to prove that Shakur fired the shots that killed either Trooper Foerster or Zayd Shakur: being an accomplice to murder carries an equivalent life sentence under New Jersey law. Upon hearing the verdict, Shakur said—in a [...] "barely audible voice"—that she was [...] "ashamed that I have even taken part in this trial" [...] and that the jury was [...] "racist" [...] and had [...] "convicted a <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> hands up". Judge Appleby told the court attendants to [...] "remove the prisoner" [...] and Shakur replied: [...] "the prisoner will walk away on her own feet". After Joseph W. Lewis, the jury foreman, read the verdict, Kunstler asked that the jury be removed before alleging that one juror had violated the sequestration order (see above).|$|E

The bill also enumerated familial relationships in which civil unions would be automatically nullified, such [...] as a man with his father, grandfather, or son, or a <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> mother, grandmother, or daughter. If one of the persons had a guardian, the guardian had to consent for the subject to obtain a civil union.|$|E

500|$|In 1987, she {{published}} Assata: An Autobiography, {{which was}} written in Cuba. Her autobiography has been cited in relation to critical legal studies and critical race theory. The book does not give {{a detailed account of}} her involvement in the BLA or the events on the New Jersey Turnpike, except to say that the jury [...] "onvicted a <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> hands up!" [...] It gives an account of her life beginning with her youth in the South and New York. Shakur challenges traditional styles of literary autobiography and offers a perspective on her life that is not easily accessible to the public. The book was published by Lawrence Hill & Company in the United States and Canada but the copyright is held by Zed Books Ltd. of London due to [...] "Son of Sam" [...] laws, which restrict who can receive profits from a book. In the six months preceding the publications of the book, Evelyn Williams, Shakur's aunt and attorney, made several trips to Cuba and served as a go-between with Hill. Her autobiography was republished in Britain in 2014 and a dramatized version performed on BBC Radio 4 in July 2017.|$|E

She won several awards for her performance, including the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Writing for Stardust, critic Ram Kamal Mukherjee asserted that the movie rested [...] "wholly and solely" [...] on Zinta's [...] "astounding performance", further noting her for having [...] "skillfully handled the hues of the complex character." [...] Derek Elley of Variety wrote, [...] "Zinta, who's been carving a growing following the past three years or so, has never been better, definitively moving from juve roles to a charismatic young <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> <b>her</b> sexy, assured Naina." ...|$|E
