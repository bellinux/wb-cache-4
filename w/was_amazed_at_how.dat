500|$|Though {{he was not}} a power pitcher, Hoffman was a strikeout pitcher. His 9.36 K/9 was the fifth-highest in MLB history, {{and highest}} ever among relievers. Sports {{journalist}} Fran Zimniuch wrote in Fireman: The Evolution of the Closer in Baseball that Hoffman was [...] "a thinking man's closer, using guile rather than heat." [...] As the velocity of his fastball decreased, he compensated with a devastating changeup that is as synonymous a pitch with Hoffman as the splitter is with Bruce Sutter or the cutter is with Mariano Rivera. [...] "It's a tough situation throwing a change-up in the ninth inning, unless you've got Trevor's changeup", closer Billy Wagner said. [...] "There's not many guys who have a changeup that's dominating", All-Star third basemen Scott Rolen said. [...] "But his is dominating. It's a weapon. That's not usually a word you use with a changeup." [...] Robb Nen, a retired closer, <b>was</b> <b>amazed</b> <b>at</b> <b>how</b> Hoffman got better after he lost velocity on his fastball. [...] "I don't think I could do it, to just lose the ability to throw 95 and still be one of the best. I have tremendous respect for him", Nen said. Another retired closer, Troy Percival, concurred about the difficulty in transforming from a power pitching style. [...] "It's not easy to do. Guys who throw 95, 96 [...] have an ego about being able to do that. [...] just went right into, 'Hey, you know, I throw 87 now. This is what I've got.' And he goes out there and gets it done just as well as he ever did." ...|$|E

This was the beginning of their friendship. Later, Garnier and Niikuni collaborated on Nichifutsu Shishū (...) , producing works such as the Micropoem.
