2500|$|Sons and Daughters {{was created}} by Reg Watson who was {{inspired}} by glossy primetime soaps Dallas and Dynasty which were averaging huge ratings in their respective time slots on CBS and ABC and was curious to see how an Australian half hour soap similar in style to those shows would fair with early evening or primetime audiences. The show was an instant hit and with writers for the show being able to place one or more families and other characters in either Sydney or Melbourne, they knew the show would appeal to viewers living in those cities. Reg Watson knew Melbourne based shows often didn't rate well with Sydney viewers, and set about using either Sydney or Melbourne as the birth place {{for much of the}} shows cast of characters. Sons and Daughters even used some former plot lines from Dallas or Dynasty to gain high viewership figures for the shows timeslot. Critics and press likened the serial as an Australian version of Latin American or South American telenovelas which would often hit huge viewership figures in their home country. British television broadcaster ITV would soon begin airing the show and audiences in the United Kingdom and other European territories would begin to become fans of the show. Most European and foreign countries that aired the show broadcast it in daytime. Ratings for the show would be very high for the first three years, but following the departure of Rowena Wallace in early 1985 to pursue other acting opportunities, ratings quickly began to decline, and a wacky and rather dull idea was put in play for Wallace's character Patricia Hamilton to return to the soap played by another actress. In mid-1985, new actress to the show Belinda Giblin arrived as Alison Carr, the new identity of Patricia, who had in a storyline featured on the show had plastic surgery in Rio De Janeiro to escape from authorities who were looking for her in Australia for crimes about killing a wealthy millionaire's son named Luke Carlyle, and used this new identity to regain entry into Australia and with an instant boost to viewership figures watching the storyline the show was deemed to be saved from cancellation. However, when Rowena Wallace returned to the show in its final two years, ratings began to slide and after six successful years the show ended in 1988 and would be replaced with new half hour soap Home and Away, created by former writer on Sons and Daughters Beven Lee. Sons and Daughters is best remembered for its over the top storylines and dramatic and often hilarious cliffhangers. One such cliffhanger featured Alison Carr being bitten by a venomous snake, which had been hidden in a <b>wall</b> <b>safe</b> that Alison broke into to steal money from villainous Wayne Hamilton played by Ian Rawlings. Though the snake used, a python would have a non lethal bite, that storyline featuring the infamous snake cliffhanger was often credited as a way to try and increase ratings for the show. Another rather dull storyline featured a bomb being hidden in the bottom of wheelchair that killed off a character in the show when it exploded. The show has gained a cult following and has been repeated more than once in both Australian and international territories.|$|E
60|$|Her scream brought Jonas {{and several}} {{servants}} upon the scene. A careful {{inspection of the}} room disclosed the fact that while much of value had been ignored the burglar had taken the easily concealed contents of the <b>wall</b> <b>safe</b> which represented fully ninety percentum {{of the value of}} the personal property in Abigail Prim's apartments.|$|E
60|$|Upon the {{dressing}} table of Abigail reposed much {{silver and gold}} and ivory, wrought by clever artisans into articles of great beauty and some utility; but with scarce a glance the burglar passed them by, directing his course straight {{across the room to}} a small <b>wall</b> <b>safe</b> cleverly hidden by a bit of tapestry.|$|E

6000|$|It {{was some}} time after dinner {{on the night of}} Abigail's {{departure}} that Mrs. Prim, following a habit achieved by years of housekeeping, set forth upon her rounds to see that doors and windows were properly secured for the night. A French window and its screen opening upon the verandah from the library she found open. [...] "The house will be full of mosquitoes!" [...] she ejaculated mentally as she closed them both with a bang and made them fast. [...] "I should just like to know who left them open. Upon my word, I don't know what would become of this place if it wasn't for me. Of all the shiftlessness!" [...] and she turned and flounced upstairs. In Abigail's room she flashed on the center dome light from force of habit, although she knew that the room had been left in proper condition after the girl's departure earlier in the day. The first thing amiss that her eagle eye noted was the candlestick lying on the floor beside the dressing table. As she stooped to pick it up she saw the open drawer from which the small automatic had been removed, and then, suspicions, suddenly aroused, as suddenly became fear; and Mrs. Prim almost dove across the room to the hidden <b>wall</b> <b>safe.</b> A moment's investigation revealed the startling fact that the safe was unlocked and practically empty. It was then that Mrs. Jonas Prim screamed.|$|E

40|$|New <b>safe</b> <b>walls</b> were {{developed}} to withstand attacks using mechanical tools and/or explosives. Model experiments with concrete slabs were carried out to obtain an insight into the influence of armor elements on the resistance capability of reinforced concrete walls. For both the damage criteria spalling and perforation, the critical charge masses were determined. The results of the slab tests were transferred to 1 m thick prototype <b>safe</b> <b>walls.</b> These were loaded with an in-wall 5 kg charge. Various parameters were tested and the protection reserved demonstrated by detonating a second 5 kg charge after the first loading. The results on the prototype experiments led to a new standard construction for <b>safe</b> <b>walls</b> of the highest safety category...|$|R

5000|$|Wall Safes: The contestants are {{introduced}} to the judges, who {{teach them how to}} install a <b>wall</b> <b>safe</b> by locating two studs and cutting out part of the wall between them. Dez and Casey, having a common wall, choose the same spot, and Casey was forced to relocate, but not without accidentally hitting Dez in the helmet with his hammer. The two and Tex (who did not use a stud finder at all) eventually fail due to cutting too big of a hole vertically (though they were more lenient on Casey). Joe also relocates, not knowing how to use a stud finder and having abandoned his first choice of location. However, he eventually manages to brute-force his safe in with a mallet (but the safe is not secured with screws). Charmaine gave up on her <b>wall</b> <b>safe.</b>|$|E
6000|$|There was a {{shout at}} last among the firemen to [...] "look out!" [...] It was feared {{one of the}} {{partition}} walls was coming down, so each man beat a hasty retreat.

5000|$|Harding {{was born}} in Nottingham but raised in the East Midlands and took his first job as an {{apprentice}} as the Rolls Royce factory in Derby. He was inspired to climb during a cycling holiday in Snowdonia in late 1943, and the following January he bought a cotton rope and began to visit the crags of the nearby Peak District with his girlfriend and climbing partner Veronica Lee. By the following summer, Harding {{was one of the}} leading climbers in the Peak District, and was beginning to make first ascents of his own, including many routes now regarded as mid-grade classics. The first of these was Promontory Traverse at Black Rocks (modern grade E1 5b) which crosses a large overhanging prow. This was followed by routes such as Goliath's Groove at Stanage Edge, the first route to be graded [...] "Exceptionally Severe", and Suicide Wall at Cratcliffe Tor in 1946, to which he gave the same grade. While modern protection has made Suicide <b>Wall</b> <b>safer</b> than it was for Harding, it is still regarded as one of Britain's most exciting rock climbs.|$|R

2500|$|Throughout its history, Barrington Hall had a {{reputation}} for supporting social and political activism. In 1960, [...] "Cal undergrads, particularly residents of the Barrington Hall co-op on Dwight Way, were part of the crowd of demonstrators protesting against the San Francisco meeting of the House Committee on Un-American Activities." [...] By the time of the People's Park Riots in May 1969, Barrington Hall, which was only two blocks from People's Park, was an infamous place in Berkeley. The devotion to cooperation in a nation committed to competition bore radical fruit after thirty-five years. Barrington became a 'safe house' for deviance, good or ill. It was safe for unmarried men and women to live together, safe to paint and draw on the <b>walls,</b> <b>safe</b> to do or sell any drug, safe to crash in if you had no other place to stay. In the 1970s and 1980s, some of its members were very active in the anti-apartheid movement, and offered sanctuary and meals to the homeless. In 1984, Barrington residents voted to make the Hall open as an official sanctuary for refugees from El Salvador.|$|R

5|$|Walls' double {{continued}} his {{success as a}} pinch hitter, making him 13-for-26 with 12 runs batted in in such situations for the season. Don Larsen entered to relieve O'Dell, who had not recorded an out but had earned a blown save for his performance. Maury Wills hit a ground ball to the first baseman, who threw home {{in an attempt to}} put out Walls who slid hard into the Giants' catcher Haller. The slide, which cut Haller's arm deep enough to later require six stitches, caused him to drop the ball, leaving <b>Walls</b> <b>safe</b> on Haller's error and extending the Dodgers' lead to 7–5. John Orsino entered as the new catcher to replace the injured Haller. Wills then stole second, his 101st stolen base of the season, before the batter Gilliam saw a single pitch. Orsino's throw to try to catch Wills went past second base and into center field. Wills attempted to advance to third, but was thrown out by Willie Mays. Larsen then induced a flyball out by Gilliam and the inning was over. Between the two halves of the sixth the two teams had scored a combined 11 runs and used six pitchers, three pinch hitters, two defensive replacements, and a pinch runner.|$|R
