5|$|In the episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) enlists a rap producer, Ridikolous (LL Cool J), {{to unload}} {{his line of}} {{inferior}} champagne while Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) reluctantly hosts the Source Awards. At the same time, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) tries to sever ties with a black man (Brady) she dislikes <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> racist.|$|E
5|$|Mark's father {{remarried}} {{and raised}} them strictly, seeking to influence {{them to become}} leaders. Throughout his childhood and teenage years, Mark's father would have him combine athletic and mental training. Mark would have to dribble a basketball <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> at it while reciting multiplication tables; practice baseball swings in a batting cage while answering questions about the periodic table and similar combined drills that his father hoped would develop quick thinking and self-confidence that would guide Mark {{in all areas of}} life and not simply sports.|$|E
5|$|Meyer {{had never}} been happy with the brightly lit {{corridors}} and feel of the Enterprise, a dissatisfaction that extended to his work on The Wrath of Khan. For The Undiscovered Country, Meyer wanted the Enterprise interiors to feel grittier and more realistic; the metal was worn around the edges to look used <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> beat up. Narita's plans to transform {{the look of the}} Enterprise on a scale not seen since The Wrath of Khan were complicated by the necessary use of existing sets.|$|E

6000|$|Anne {{swept by}} disdainfully, <b>without</b> <b>look</b> or sign of hearing. [...] "Oh how could you, Anne?" [...] breathed Diana {{as they went}} down the road half reproachfully, half admiringly. Diana felt that SHE could never have {{resisted}} Gilbert's plea.|$|R
5|$|Madeleine's {{mother had}} {{intended}} {{to check on the}} children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door to 5A. He noticed that the McCanns' children's bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> far enough into the bedroom to see whether Madeleine was there. He could not recall whether the bedroom window and its exterior shutter were open at this point. Early on in the investigation, the Polícia Judiciária accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do the check, suggesting to him that he had handed Madeleine to someone through the bedroom window.|$|E
5|$|Perfect Dark {{is set in}} 2023 {{against the}} {{backdrop}} of an interstellar war between two races: the Maians, who resemble the archetypal grey alien, and the Skedar, reptile-like extraterrestrials who use a holographic disguise to appear as Scandinavian humans, bearing similarities to Nordic aliens. Using this disguise, they can interact with humans on Earth <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> too overtly suspicious. Meanwhile, on Earth, there is an ongoing rivalry between two factions: The Carrington Institute, a research and development center founded by Daniel Carrington that secretly operates an espionage group in league with the Maians; and dataDyne, a defence contractor corporation headed by Cassandra De Vries that secretly maintains a deal with the Skedar: in exchange for creating an AI capable of cracking an ancient alien spacecraft buried on the ocean floor, the Skedar have agreed to supply them with enough alien technology to become the biggest corporation on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The rough idea {{of these}} inapproximability results is {{to form a}} graph that {{represents}} a probabilistically checkable proof system for an NP-complete problem such as the Boolean satisfiability problem. In a probabilistically checkable proof system, a proof is represented as a sequence of bits. An instance of the satisfiability problem should have a valid proof {{if and only if}} it is satisfiable. The proof is checked by an algorithm that, after a polynomial-time computation on the input to the satisfiability problem, chooses to examine a small number of randomly chosen positions of the proof string. Depending on what values are found at that sample of bits, the checker will either accept or reject the proof, <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> at the rest of the bits. False negatives are not allowed: a valid proof must always be accepted. However, an invalid proof may sometimes mistakenly be accepted. For every invalid proof, the probability that the checker will accept it must be low.|$|E

25|$|<b>Without</b> <b>looking,</b> Hooten (#50) {{immediately}} {{flipped the}} ball over his head to Wide Receiver Michael Tomlin (#3), who caught it around the Millsaps 47.|$|E
25|$|Two {{hundred and}} twenty-seven {{days after the}} ship's sinking, the {{lifeboat}} washes onto a beach in Mexico, after which Richard Parker disappears into the nearby jungle <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> back, leaving Pi heartbroken at the abrupt farewell.|$|E
25|$|The Cina Kampung in Kelantan have {{native speaker}} {{competence}} in the Kelantanese dialect. It is impossible to tell a Malay from a Chinese by listening to his speech in the Kelantanese dialect, <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> at the person.|$|E

25|$|I am not {{interested}} to know whether Vivisection produces results that are profitable to the human race or doesn't.... The pains which it inflicts upon unconsenting animals {{is the basis of}} my enmity towards it, and it is to me sufficient justification of the enmity <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> further.|$|E
25|$|The crucial {{aspect of}} any good pass is it being {{difficult}} to intercept. Good passers can pass {{the ball with}} great accuracy and they know exactly where each of their other teammates prefers to receive the ball. A special way of doing this is passing the ball <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> at the receiving teammate. This is called a no-look pass.|$|E
25|$|Around 2007, insurgents {{attempted}} to use bomb-equipped dogs during the Iraq War. Remote controls {{were used to}} detonate the bomb. In one documented incident in Iraq, the dog was detonated without inflicting damage. More often, donkeys were used, as they were more reliable. Donkeys are traditionally equipped with sacks and thus could carry a large explosive charge <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> suspicious.|$|E

60|$|Soames walked upstairs. Passing the drawing-room <b>without</b> a <b>look,</b> he went {{straight}} {{up to his}} mother's and father's bedroom.|$|R
25|$|Without {{going outside}} his door, one understands (all that takes place) under the sky; <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> {{out from his}} window, one sees the Tao of Heaven. The farther that one goes out (from himself), the less he knows. Therefore the sages got their {{knowledge}} without travelling; gave their (right) names to things without seeing them; and accomplished their ends without any purpose of doing so.|$|E
25|$|HR = 1,500/RR {{interval}} in millimeters, HR = 60/RR interval in seconds, or HR = 300/number {{of large}} squares between successive R waves. In each case, {{the authors are}} actually referring to instantaneous HR, which {{is the number of}} times the heart would beat if successive RR intervals were constant. However, because the above formula is almost always mentioned, students determine HR this way <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> at the ECG any further.|$|E
25|$|Like Yemenite Jewish homes, the synagogues in Yemen had to {{be lower}} in height than the lowest mosque in the area. In order to {{accommodate}} this, synagogues were built into the ground to give them more space <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> large from the outside. In some parts of Yemen, minyanim would often just meet in homes of Jews, instead of the community having a separate building for a synagogue. Beauty and artwork were saved for the ritual objects in the synagogue and in the home.|$|E

25|$|The {{methods of}} craft {{transmission}} {{were based on}} those established in China, and consisted of highly methodical copying of sample images until they could be adequately reproduced <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> at the model. This was practiced {{in a number of}} ways, including through use of edehon, “pictorial models containing sketches of such things as ideal forms, subjects, and objects that are copied repeatedly for study purposes in learning painting.” This was employed ardently within the Kanō School, which wanted to ensure its tenets were not diluted through its wide network of painters. Consistency was also attempted through written manuals detailing such trade secrets as pigments and brush technique.|$|E
25|$|In the Argonautica, a 3rd-century BCE Alexandrian epic {{based on}} early material, Jason placates Hecate in a ritual {{prescribed}} by Medea, her priestess: bathed at midnight {{in a stream}} of flowing water, and dressed in dark robes, Jason is to dig a round pit and over it cut the throat of an ewe, sacrificing it and then burning it whole on a pyre next to the pit as a holocaust. He is told to sweeten the offering with a libation of honey, then to retreat from the site <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> back, even if he hears the sound of footsteps or barking dogs. All these elements betoken the rites owed to a chthonic deity.|$|E
25|$|The Pokémon Go Plus is a Bluetooth {{low energy}} {{wearable}} device, developed by Nintendo's Platform Technology Development division, that allows players to perform certain {{actions in the}} game <b>without</b> <b>looking</b> at their smart device. When a player is near a Pokémon or PokéStop, the Plus vibrates. The player can then press the button to capture the Pokémon or receive items from the PokéStop; the player cannot check what they have received until {{the next time they}} sign into the app on their mobile device. The design consists of a Poké Ball and the shape of the Google Maps pin. The decision to create the device rather than create a smart watch app was to increase uptake among players for whom a smart watch is prohibitively expensive. It was released in the United Kingdom and North America on September 16, 2016.|$|E
