25|$|In Series 9, Capaldi {{described}} his character as a 'thrill-seeker' who is confronting danger where he soon realises {{that he is}} 'one of the luckiest creatures in all of time and space' and that 'life is short even at two-thousand years'. According to Coleman regarding Clara's bond with The Doctor inquring if she had feelings for him she stated “She’s totally in love with him, always has been. It’s its own kind of love. He is her hero but she would be very reluctant to tell him that. It’s a doctor-and-companion love, and there’s nothing else like it really.” “They’re kind of freed of their issues and in a <b>wonderful</b> <b>place</b> together. Previously {{she was trying to}} keep him under control yet now the two of them are going ‘Come on, lets jump, lets do it’, egging each other on really, and being more and more reckless,” she teased. Capaldi stated “It’s sort of an utterly platonic bond, which is quite unusual. The problem is the Doctor knows a lot more than he ever says. He knows Clara’s fate. He knows the fate of all his companions before they do.” Ultimately it has been confirmed by both Capaldi and Coleman that the Doctor and Clara's relationship is romantic in nature.|$|E
500|$|Thirty Seconds to Mars {{announced}} on April 25, 2014 {{that they have}} parted from Virgin Records after tumultuous years with the label, with Leto telling Billboard, [...] "We're free and clear and excited about the future. It's the most <b>wonderful</b> <b>place</b> to be." [...] In August 2014, the group embarked on a double-headline tour, dubbed the Carnivores Tour, with American rock band Linkin Park, visiting arenas and stadiums throughout North America. Thirty Seconds to Mars then launched a music festival called Camp Mars. The first edition took place in Malibu, California, in August 2015 and included a series of activities in a semi-rustic setting and several DJ sets.|$|E
500|$|As with {{previous}} ceremonies he produced, Cates centered the show around a theme. This year, he christened {{the show with}} the theme [...] "Togetherness of Moviegoing" [...] commenting, [...] "The thing that's kind of wonderful about movies is that you watch them with other people. The only other areas where you do that, {{when you think about}} it, are religion and sports." [...] He concluded by noting that the movie theater is [...] "a <b>wonderful</b> <b>place</b> where you come together to laugh, to cry." [...] In tandem with the theme, actress Winona Ryder presented a montage featuring film clips from Matinee, Casablanca, and A Streetcar Named Desire depicting audiences inside a movie theater.|$|E

500|$|Coward's {{political}} views were conservative, but not unswervingly so: he despised {{the government of}} Neville Chamberlain for its policy of appeasing Nazi Germany, and he differed sharply with Winston Churchill over the abdication crisis of 1936. Whereas Churchill supported Edward VIII's wish to marry [...] "his cutie", Wallis Simpson, Coward thought the king irresponsible, telling Churchill, [...] "England doesn't wish for a Queen Cutie." [...] Coward disliked propaganda in plays; [...] "The theatre is a <b>wonderful</b> <b>place,</b> a house of strange enchantment, a temple of illusion. What it most emphatically is not {{and never will be}} is a scruffy, ill-lit, fumed-oak drill hall serving as a temporary soap box for political propaganda." [...] Nevertheless, his own views sometimes surfaced in his plays: both Cavalcade and This Happy Breed are, {{in the words of the}} playwright David Edgar, [...] "overtly Conservative political plays written in the Brechtian epic manner." [...] In religion, Coward was agnostic. He wrote of his views, [...] "Do I believe in God? I can't say No and I can't say Yes, To me it's anybody's guess." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 1832, Newman {{went with}} Hurrell Froude, {{on account of}} the latter's health, for a tour in Southern Europe. On board the mail {{steamship}} Hermes they visited Gibraltar, Malta, the Ionian Islands and, subsequently, Sicily, Naples and Rome, where Newman made the acquaintance of Nicholas Wiseman. In a letter home he described Rome as [...] "the most <b>wonderful</b> <b>place</b> on Earth", but the Roman Catholic Church as [...] "polytheistic, degrading and idolatrous".|$|E
2500|$|The {{shopping}} center was later added to OHP {{and became a}} vital place to gather for both shopping and socializing. During {{the period of the}} 1950s and 1960s most mothers were [...] "at home" [...] and most families had one car, if any. On any day of the week, one could see many mothers and children walking, playing, visiting, shopping, etc.,- a real neighborhood atmosphere and a <b>wonderful</b> <b>place</b> to raise a family. The location was convenient to downtown Boston, while the feeling of OHP was very suburban.|$|E

2500|$|In Wind, Whales and Whisky, Silver Donald Cameron {{discusses}} one of {{the ironies}} he sees about life in Cape Breton. On the one hand, the island seems poor with chronic unemployment, but on the other, its rural inhabitants have access to abundant and delicious food such as apples, cranberries, fish, deer, moose and the produce from their gardens. After describing [...] "the most unbelievably wonderful meal of the voyage"—lobster and grey sole baked in the oven with tinned mushroom soup accompanied by scalloped potatoes and broccoli, Cameron writes: [...] "I love living in a depressed region, I thought. One lives so well." [...] In a chapter entitled, Good People in Bad Times, Cameron outlines the troubles of industrial Cape Breton including the long decline of two of its economic mainstays, coal mining and steel making. [...] "It is a hard place to make a living," [...] he writes, [...] "but it is a <b>wonderful</b> <b>place</b> to live." ...|$|E

5000|$|According to Alexander & team, {{the work}} {{originated}} from an observation that [...] At the core … {{is the idea}} that people should design for themselves their own houses, streets and communities.
