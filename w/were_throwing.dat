5|$|Engine Co. 22's {{vehicle was}} blown across Broad Street and {{eventually}} burned. Several {{members of the}} company were injured. Hart was thrown across a rooftop by the explosion but only sustained a minor ankle injury. Augustus L. Cowdrey of Engine Co. 42 and Dave Van Winkle of Engine Co. 5 <b>were</b> <b>throwing</b> water on an adjacent building when a second explosion occurred in the warehouse. The explosion threw Van Winkle into the street. Cowdrey was killed, his body never found. His company continued to search for him amid the rubble for two days. His name appears along with many others on a memorial in Trinity Churchyard in New York for volunteer firefighters {{who died in the}} line of duty.|$|E
5|$|None of them played instruments, so I {{was left}} to do the music and get that vibe together. What I said to them was, 'Look, I've got a chorus—check this out'. And I'd sing them the chorus and the melody—no lyrics or anything—and {{straight}} away five pencils and pads came out and they <b>were</b> <b>throwing</b> lines at us. Ten minutes later the song was written. Then you go through and refine it. Then later, as you were recording it you might change a few thing here and there. But pretty much {{it was a real}} quick process. They were confident in what they were doing, throwing it out there.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, La Sombra and Rush were {{involved}} in an incident in Guadalajara, where the two attacked fans who <b>were</b> <b>throwing</b> beers at them. The following day, Jalisco's Boxing and Wrestling Commission suspended the two from wrestling in the state for three months. While the commission only suspended them from wrestling in Jalisco, CMLL decided to pull both La Sombra and Rush from their Super Viernes show three days later. CMLL did not offer an official explanation for the change. Over the summer of 2015 Los Ingobernables started to wrestle against tecnico teams instead of generally facing rudo teams {{as they had been}} up to that point. By August, 2015 Los Ingobernables found themselves facing off against Atlantis on multiple occasions, often with La Sombra going {{out of his way to}} attack Atlantis, tearing Atlantis' mask apart during matches to show his disdain for the veteran tecnico. On August 19, 2015 CMLL held a press conference where they announced that the winner of the main event of the 80th Anniversary, La Sombra, would put his mask on the line against the winner of the main event of the 81st Anniversary Show, Atlantis, in the main event of the CMLL 82nd Anniversary Show on September 18, 2015. On August 31, La Sombra lost the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship to Último Guerrero, ending his two and a half year reign. La Sombra lost the Lucha de Apuestas match to Atlantis. As a result, La Sombra was forced to unmask and reveal his real name. In early November, La Sombra and Rush began having issues with each other, which led to a singles match between the two on November 13, where Rush was victorious. After the match, which turned out to be La Sombra's final with CMLL, the two founding members of Los Ingobernables made peace with each other.|$|E

25|$|In the Ardoyne area of North Belfast, {{there was}} a shootout between IRA members and an RUC mobile patrol, without casualties.

According to a republican report, this action was filmed by an independent television crew. The IRA also allegedly shot two loyalists who <b>were</b> <b>throwing</b> petrol bombs at Catholic homes there.

25|$|At Rugby Park, Hamilton (the site of today's Waikato Stadium), on 25 July, about 350 protesters {{invaded the}} pitch after pulling down a fence. The police arrested about 50 {{of them over}} a period of an hour, but were {{concerned}} that they could not control the rugby crowd, who <b>were</b> <b>throwing</b> bottles and other objects at the protesters. Following reports that a stolen light plane (piloted by Pat McQuarrie) was approaching the stadium, police cancelled the match. The protesters were ushered from the ground and were advised by protest marshals to remove any anti-tour insignia from their attire, with enraged rugby spectators lashing out at them. Gangs of rugby supporters waited outside Hamilton police station for arrested protesters to be processed and released, and assaulted some protesters making their way into Victoria Street.|$|E

25|$|Herrera {{turned his}} prisoners over to men in his squad, then started {{crawling}} {{toward the other}} machine gun, firing as he went. (“My M-1 was talking, and the Germans understood what it was saying,” he commented later.) The position was protected by a minefield; GIs <b>were</b> <b>throwing</b> rocks into the area {{in an effort to}} explode the mines. Herrera got up and charged the Germans anyway, but as he neared the machine-gun nest, he stepped on a mine. He was thrown to the ground, both of his feet blown off at the ankle. Though bleeding heavily, he lay on his stomach and fired at the Germans, forcing them to stay down and thus enabling his squad to skirt the minefield, flank the enemy, and move in for the kill.|$|E
25|$|About an {{hour later}} the British {{trenches}} had been occupied and a mine gallery was discovered off a blind sap (a trench with a dead-end) with 16 British troops inside behind a barricade; the British surrendered once they had been discovered. The Germans had great difficulty consolidating their new positions, in the dark, under artillery-fire and counter-attack and in the 8th Company area, the troops formed a human chain to pass hand-grenades forward. As dawn broke the new positions had been dug down to head height but linking the new diggings to the lips of craters was done with great difficulty because the explosions had thrown {{a great deal of}} earth onto the crater edges and British troops <b>were</b> <b>throwing</b> grenades into the craters. Communication trenches were too shallow and soldiers had to crawl along them once dawn had broken and many were hit by bullets. The captured trenches had much British equipment in them which was used by the Germans to repulse counter-attacks.|$|E
25|$|On 2 December, {{at about}} 4a.m., Achilles {{was in the}} {{latitude}} of San Domingo when lookouts saw a large vessel sailing towards them. The British feared {{that this was a}} 44-gun French frigate. Achilles cleared for action and at 8a.m. saw that the French vessel had altered her course and that people aboard her <b>were</b> <b>throwing</b> things overboard. Hogg set off to intercept and by about 9:30a.m. got close enough for an engagement to commence. de Menard had his small arms men fire on the French vessel but kept most of his men out of harm's way below deck. The French vessel thought that it was dealing with a lightly-manned merchant vessel and attempted to put boarders on Achilles. After about three-quarters of an hour Achilles was in a position for the Dutch soldiers hidden below deck to come out and board the French vessel. The Anglo-German boarding party quickly cleared the French deck and took command of the vessel.|$|E

25|$|The Salii, {{after their}} name (salire: to leap, to dance), {{were devoted to}} ritual dance. Twice a year, at the Quinquatria on 19 March and the Armilustrium on 19 October, they played {{important}} roles in public ceremonies marking the opening and closing of the campaigning season. On other days in March and October (and especially during the festival of Mars from 1 to 24 March), they would march {{through the streets of}} Rome, halting at intervals to perform their ritual dances, beat their shields with staffs, and sing the Carmen Saliare, a hymn in archaic Latin. The song would have been nearly unintelligible, but Marcus learned it by heart. He took his duties seriously. Marcus rose through the offices of the priesthood, becoming in turn the leader of the dance, the vates (prophet), and the master of the order. Once, when the Salii <b>were</b> <b>throwing</b> their crowns onto the banqueting couch of the gods, as was customary, Marcus' fell on the brow of Mars. In later years, this event would be read as an auspicious omen heralding Marcus' future rule.|$|E
25|$|Blücher {{received}} {{a report from}} Cossack commander Friedrich Karl von Tettenborn that Napoleon was approaching. Recalling his drubbing in the Six Days' Campaign {{at the beginning of}} February, the Prussian field marshal immediately began transferring his army to the north bank of the Marne. By 2:00 pm on 1 March, the guns of Napoleon's advanced guard <b>were</b> <b>throwing</b> shells across the river, {{but it was too late}} to catch the Allies. By 10:00 am that morning, Blücher's rear guard cavalry under Fyodor Karlovich Korf safely crossed to the north bank of the Marne. Blücher had hoped to fight Napoleon with the bulk of his army, while Kleist dealt with Marmont and Mortier. Since Kleist fumbled, the Prussian army commander ordered Kleist into action again while committing major units to attack Marmont and Mortier. Yorck's I Prussian Corps marched to Crouy-sur-Ourcq while Kaptzevich and Korf moved to Gesvres farther south. Sacken at Lizy-sur-Ourcq would cover the shift while the Army of Silesia's wagon and pontoon trains were ordered northeast to Gandelu, in case a retreat to Oulchy-le-Château became necessary.|$|E
500|$|As of mid-August, Feldman's cut fastball was {{the most}} {{effective}} in the major leagues.

50|$|Not to be {{confused}} with the 540 crescent, a crescent 540 is where a crescent kick <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> out with one leg before the 540 kick <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> with the other, essentially executing two separate kicks during the same motion. A slight variation of this is where the crescent kick <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> as a sideways snap kick, followed by a round house kick. The hips must be rotated more before the kicks <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> and the body tilts in the direction of the kicks, which can cause a person to lose their balance on the landing.|$|R

5000|$|A given juggling {{pattern is}} {{represented}} by a sequence of digits, like [...] "333", [...] "97531", or [...] "744".

For example, [...] "333" [...] represents a common three-ball cascade, where three props <b>are</b> <b>thrown</b> before the same prop will <b>be</b> caught and <b>thrown</b> again. Within the [...] "531531" [...] pattern, the prop thrown first, the '5' <b>throw,</b> will not <b>be</b> caught until five <b>throws</b> have <b>been</b> made, including itself, where it will <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> again as a '1'. The prop thrown next, the '3', will <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> again on the third throw afterwards, the next '3'. And the next prop <b>is</b> <b>thrown</b> with a '1' <b>throw,</b> which <b>is</b> a direct pass to the other hand and will <b>be</b> <b>thrown</b> on the very next throw as a '5'.|$|R
500|$|After {{moving to}} Rangers, Baxter became a notorious womaniser. In his words, [...] "One day, I was a Raith Rovers player who couldnae pull the birds at the Cowdenbeath Palais.

[...] However, in 1965 he married Jean Ferguson, a hairdresser, and the couple brought up two sons Alan and Steven. His marriage to Jean broke down in 1981 and the two divorced. Jean married golfer William McCondichie three years later. In 1983 Baxter formed a relationship with Norma Morton, and the couple remained together {{until his death in}} 2001.|$|E
500|$|Craig {{was back}} in action on June 1, and three days later, his tiebreaking two-run home run against the Mets allowed the Cardinals to end a five-game losing streak with a 5–4 win.

[...] However, Craig discovered that pitchers <b>were</b> <b>throwing</b> him more sliders. [...] Over the next nine games through July 3, he solved his opponents' strategy, batting [...]364 with five HR and 15 RBI. [...] His season total to that date included appearing in just 40 of the Cardinals' 80 first games, taking 152 at-bats. [...] Nonetheless, he tied Holliday (296 at-bats), catcher Yadier Molina (265), and third baseman David Freese (276) with 13 HRs. [...] He also carried a [...]322 batting average with 43 RBI. [...] The RBI total ranked third in the NL since May 1, even with the second DL stay.|$|E
500|$|Two reviewers {{watched the}} episode for Tor.com.

[...] She praised the humour and the references, and found Dax {{in her role as}} a stand-in for fans of The Original Series. She gave the episode a score of six out of six. Eugene Myers wasn't disappointed following the hype about the episode, saying that it was [...] "steeped in nostalgia". He thought that the bomb-in-a-tribble plot was ingenious and allowed the episode to step outside of merely being good due to the success of [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles". His favourite scene was the constant stream of tribbles hitting Kirk on the head because Sisko and Dax <b>were</b> <b>throwing</b> them out of the grain compartment while looking for the bomb.
