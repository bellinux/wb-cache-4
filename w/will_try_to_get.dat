25|$|The {{methods used}} in a typical pirate attack have been analyzed. They show that while attacks can be {{expected}} at any time, most occur during the day; often in the early hours. They may involve two or more skiffs that can reach speeds of up to 25 knots. With the help of motherships that include captured fishing and merchant vessels, the operating range of the skiffs has been increased far into the Indian Ocean. An attacked vessel is approached from quarter or stern; RPGs and small arms are used to intimidate the operator {{to slow down and}} allow boarding. Light ladders are brought along to climb aboard. Pirates then <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> control of the bridge to take operational control of the vessel.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} between professional and amateur novelists often is the author's ability to publish. Many people take up novel {{writing as a}} hobby, but the difficulties of completing large scale fictional works of quality prevent the completion of novels. Once authors have completed a novel, they often <b>will</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it published. The publishing industry requires novels to have accessible profitable markets, thus many novelists will self-publish to circumvent the editorial control of publishers. Self-publishing {{has long been an}} option for writers, with vanity presses printing bound books for a fee paid by the writer. In these settings, unlike the more traditional publishing industry, activities usually reserved for a publishing house, like the distribution and promotion of the book, become the author's responsibility. The rise of the Internet and electronic books has made self publishing far less expensive and a realistic way for authors to realize income.|$|E

500|$|On 14 February, Benfica {{began their}} 2006–07 UEFA Cup {{campaign}} {{with a home}} game against Dinamo București.
