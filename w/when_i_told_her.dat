So <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> my {{character}} {{was going to be}} mixed up with Adam, she went, 'Oh! He is so good, but so bad'". Egan said that her mother [...] "told me he was a great character, but an evil one, so I was really excited. And now knowing Michael, it has been so much fun." [...] She said that [...] "everyone seems to think we have good on-screen chemistry" [...] and that [...] "it's an interesting energy between Chelsea and Adam being the [...] "bad guys" [...] in town." [...] Egan said Adam was Sharon's biggest supporter when Chelsea had Billy's baby and gave him up.|$|E

"She {{wanted to}} know what you did--how you spent your time. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that you had no profession, that you did nothing except play cricket and polo, and hunt and shoot, she seemed most unaccountably surprised. She {{appeared}} almost incredulous <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that you seldom came to London, and still more seldom went abroad. I wonder what she had in her head?" ...|$|E

60|$|MISS MEADOWCROFT and I {{were the}} only representatives of the family at the farm who {{attended}} the trial. We went separately to Narrabee.

6000|$|<b>When,</b> however, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that {{my friend}} Jephson {{was going to}} {{collaborate}} with me, she remarked, [...] "Oh," [...] in a doubtful tone; and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> further {{went on to explain}} to her that Selkirk Brown and Derrick MacShaughnassy were also going to assist, she replied, [...] "Oh," [...] in a tone which contained no trace of doubtfulness whatever, and from which it was clear that her interest in the matter, as a practical scheme, had entirely evaporated.|$|R
6000|$|Will {{you believe}} me that I {{had to tell her}} what it was? And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> she exclaimed with {{extraordinary}} callousness, [...] "The book?

[...] Had she not added Pooh I might have spared her, but as it was I raised the blotting-pad rather haughtily and presented her with the sheet beneath it.|$|R

6000|$|... "No, Smith; it is {{an offense}} to suggest, or even to think, such a thing, however much you may love her, for she {{is not allowed to}} {{converse}} with any one directly or through me. She told me that she saw you on the hills, and that you tried to go to her, and it distressed her very much. But she will forgive you <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>her</b> how great your love is, that the desire to look on her face made you forget how wrong it was to approach her." ...|$|R
6000|$|There was {{not much}} {{ceremony}} between us, before <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> all the material circumstances that had happened in her absence, especially about the girl's imprisonments which she had contrived, and how she had got my letter at the Quaker's, the very day she had been there. [...] "Well," [...] says Amy, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> all, [...] "I find nothing is to ensue, if she lives, but your ruin; you would not agree to her death, so I will not make myself uneasy about her life; {{it might have been}} rectified, but you were angry with me for giving you the best of counsel, viz., <b>when</b> <b>I</b> proposed to murder her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll explain myself, sir," [...] {{says the}} Sergeant. [...] "When I came here, I {{undertook}} {{to throw the}} necessary light {{on the matter of}} the missing Diamond.

6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} she doesn't think that I {{care much about}} it. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> I did it all of a heap, you see; and I fancy she thought I was just mad at the time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{looks as}} if you didn't know Lance yet; I'm not sure you {{altogether}} know Evelyn. Anyhow, I saw her and stopped the thing. I think she got a bad jolt <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> about the punt." ...|$|E
6000|$|It <b>told</b> me that <b>I</b> had not {{surprised}} her.

Is there fear in your heart of the return of that tempting spirit in you, in the time to come?" ...|$|R

6000|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Arthur, I couldn’t tell my wife. <b>When</b> could <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>her?</b> Not last night. It {{would have}} made a life-long {{separation}} between us, and I would have lost the love of the one woman in the world I worship, of the only woman who has ever stirred love within me. Last night it would have been quite impossible. She would have turned from me in horror [...] . in horror and in contempt.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{a foolish}} man!" [...] said Euphemia, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> the above incident, [...] "to {{talk that way}} when you stood there {{with a gun in}} your hand. You might have raked his wagon, fore and aft." ...|$|E

6000|$|Returning {{home with}} musing {{footsteps}} through the softly breathing streets, I ponder {{the words of}} the old House. Is it but as some foolish mother thinking all the world interested in her child, or may there lie wisdom in its counsel? Then to my guidance or misguidance comes the thought of a certain small section of the Public who often of an evening commands of me a story; and who, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>her</b> of the dreadful giants and of the gallant youths who slay them, of the wood-cutter's sons who rescue maidens from Ogre-guarded castles; of the Princesses the most beautiful in all the world, of the Princes with magic swords, still unsatisfied, creeps closer yet, saying: [...] "Now tell me a real story," [...] adding for my comprehending: [...] "You know: about a little girl who lived in a big house with her father and mother, and who was sometimes naughty, you know." ...|$|R
60|$|My {{uncle was}} much {{disturbed}} by the strange loss of his valet, the more so as it was his custom {{to go through a}} whole series of washings and changings after even the shortest journey. For my own part, mindful of my mother's advice, I carefully brushed the dust from my clothes and made myself as neat as possible. My heart was down in the soles of my little silver-buckled shoes now that I had the immediate prospect of meeting so great and terrible a person as the Prince of Wales. I had seen his flaring yellow barouche flying through Friar's Oak many a time, and had halloaed and waved my hat with the others as it passed, but never in my wildest dreams had it entered my head that I should ever be called upon to look him in the face and answer his questions. My mother had taught me to regard him with reverence, as one of those whom God had placed to rule over us; but my uncle smiled <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him of <b>her</b> teaching.|$|R

This is the story. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> it to {{the stupid}} {{waitress}} that works with me she said {{it looks like an}} American movie to her despite the moral of the story. I asked her what the moral of the story was and she said, “That we all die in the end”. It seemed silly, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> it’s not a moral but a simple fact of life that any idiot knows. After a few days I went to work once more and this time another waitress was on duty - Ruty. While working in the kitchen and cutting vegetables for a salad <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> the story and then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> about the moral from the stupid waitress. Ruty said it’s nonsense and that it’s not the moral of the story and asked me to add olives to the salad, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>her,</b> “The moral of the story is that it’s better to mind your own business, and to always look at things as a bystander, otherwise you get hurt” and surprisingly, Ruty said, “No. That’s not the moral of the story. The moral of the story is that life is ironic and that life stinks”, to me it sounded like my own moral, only more generally put. So I had nothing to argue about. I sat next to her at the bar with a bowl and two forks and in the end we ate salad. (From the last page of the book.) "...|$|R
