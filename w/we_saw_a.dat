500|$|I {{happened}} to be at Cambridge. I was sent there by the [...] government on a government grant. And I'd read some of Ted's poems in this magazine and I was very impressed and I wanted to meet him. I went to this little celebration and that's actually where we met... Then <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> great deal of each other. Ted came back to Cambridge and suddenly we found ourselves getting married a few months later... We kept writing poems to each other. Then it just grew out of that, I guess, a feeling that we both were writing so much and having such a fine time doing it, we decided that this should keep on.|$|E

The re-released single reached #23 in the U.S; a US-only compilation album containing the track The Early Beatles, re-entered the album charts at #197. The version heard in the film includes brass overdubbed onto the Beatles' original recording, which did not go down well with Paul McCartney. [...] "I liked [...] film but they overdubbed some lousy brass on the stuff! If it had needed brass, we'd had stuck it on ourselves!" [...] Upon hearing McCartney's reaction, Hughes felt bad for [...] "offend a Beatle.

500|$|One of Nick's {{most notable}} {{returns to the}} series {{occurred}} in 1990. Nick returned to his mother's life with the claim {{that he was a}} born-again Christian, which happened to coincide with her £1000 win on the bingo. EastEnders writer Sarah Phelps explained: [...] "For Dot, the idea that Jesus had finally spoken to Nick, that was all her Christmases coming at once! Nick knew that. It was sort of obvious that Nick could be saying 'Jesus walks with me' and then just go out and kick somebody or nick their wallet." [...] With the help of a fake priest, Nick managed to convince his mother of his new-found faith and then began a slow campaign to control her eating habits and poison her in order to claim her money. Discussing the storyline, scriptwriter Colin Brake has indicated that at first it was not clear to the audience whether Nick had reformed or not, but as the weeks passed it became obvious that he did intend to kill his mother, as he was shown practising a fake suicide note in Dot's handwriting– a foil to cover the intended murder; according to Brake, Dot remained blithely and perhaps purposefully ignorant to his wrongdoing. The episode which culminated the storyline, written by P.J. Hammond, was set solely in Dot's house and featured an unusually small cast consisting of Nick, Dot, Nick's estranged father Charlie, Dot's close friend Ethel Skinner and Alistair the fake priest. At the last moment, in what Altman has called the [...] "one time <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> glimmer of Nick’s good side", Nick backed out of his plan and stopped Dot from eating the poisoned meal he had intended to kill her with. Once again Dot was left alone, broken-hearted at what her own son had been prepared to do to her.|$|E

The album also prominently featured the intricate percussion work of band member Budgie.

[...] He then abandoned the buglers and fell on the neck of the first drummer. [...] For a moment the drum stood between him and the object of his affections, but eventually he managed to plant two loud kisses on the drummer’s cheeks. [...] Then he made for the general-in-chief. [...] There was a sudden hush, as when an orchestra falls silent {{at the end of a}} dance. [...] He recovered himself, solemnly clicked his heels, and saluted General Brière de l’Isle. [...] We recognised Captain de Borelli.|$|E

RedLynx Chief Executive Officer Tero Virtala stated that [...] "I strongly believe {{that at some point}} there will be multiplatform launches from us, but those games will have to be such that from the start we feel that it’s going to be an excellent game for every platform." [...] Ilvesssuo stated in a separate interview that MotoHeroz was not intended to be a [...] "Trials HD copycat", and that the original concept for the game was over five years old at the time. He also re-emphasized the focus on Nintendo's audience, stating [...] "With WiiWare, <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> great opportunity as it suited this type of game very well".

[...] Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph assessed the concert, assigning it 4 out of 5 stars, and wrote, [...] "he real highlight of this show was a stripped back version of 'Like a Virgin'...

Giving the performance 4 out of 5 stars, she reveals: [...] "Thousands of fans gave a regal welcome as her Madgesty took the stage", that [...] "the pure theatre of her performance was enough to sustain the 11,000 strong audience" [...] and [...] "the feel good classics proved why the 53 year old is the original and the best." [...] Madonna's performance in Edinburgh also received generally positive reviews. Beverley Lyons from Daily Record stated: [...] "Madonna's still in Vogue with fans" [...] and [...] "this was a remarkable show– and a night when <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> softer side to the Queen of Pop." ...|$|E

2500|$|UCSD Economics {{professor}} Julian Betts states: “What {{all this}} means for spending is that starting around 1978-1979 <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> sharp reduction in spending on schools. We fell {{compared to other}} states dramatically, and we still haven’t really caught up to other states.” [...] From 1977, in California {{there has been a}} steady growth of class sizes compared to the national average, “which have been decreasing since 1970.” [...] The shortage in funds translated to decreased spending per student in the years following passage of Proposition 13. During the 1970s, school spending per student was almost equal to the national average. Using discount rate, “measured in 1997-1998 dollars, California spent about $100 more per capita on its public schools in 1969-1970 than did the rest of the country." [...] Since 1981-1982, California consistently has spent less per student {{than the rest of the}} U.S. as demonstrated by data collected by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and by the Public Policy Institute of California [...] This has resulted in increased pupil-to-teacher ratios in K-12 public schools in California. Professor Betts observes that “pupil-teacher ratios start to skyrocket in the years immediately after 1978, and a huge gap opens up between pupil-teacher ratios here and in the rest of the country, and we still haven’t recovered from that." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the war Brody's train station had gone up in flames. Now a {{ramshackle}} buffet had been set up in one of the ruins. When I entered, the place was packed with officers, who were standing at the buffet or around small tables, consuming borshch. I noticed that the soup bowls bore a Hebrew inscription that read [...] "mazel tov", congratulations. The china had been evidently stolen from a Jewish hotel…The road to Brody was flanked by burned and desolate cottages. In the distance <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> broad field covered with ruins. Soon the devastated town emerged from the grey mist of an early winter morning. There were blackened chimneys and burned walls as far as we could see, visible beneath a dusting of downy snow. The town looked like the ancient, mossy remnants of Pompeii. I noticed the schorched wall of a synagogue. Above the door, some Hebrew words had survived: How awesome is this place [...] The verse was fitting for the ruins of the house of worship and for the entire spread of the shattered neighbourhood. Nestled among the wreckage I saw a small cottage almost embedded in the earth. It looked as if it had crouched down during the conflagration, hidden in the ground, and therefore survived. An old Jewish man was standing nearby, as poor and hunched as the cottage itself. When he saw me and my friend in our uniforms, he whipped off his cap and bowed deeply. I went over and asked in Yiddish, [...] "How come your cottage escaped the fire?" [...] The old man gaped at me, then shrugged and sighed. [...] "Perhaps a miracle… Heaven granted us a place to starve to death." [...] I gave him a rouble. He was so amazed he forgot to thank me. He stood motionless, gawking. We walked on among the burned ruins. I noticed something that I would see again and again: at every street corner, shiny metal signs in Russian had been nailed to the walls. The occupiers had given every street a fancy, new name: Pushkin Street, Gogol Street, Lermontov Street, and even Turgenev Street, if I remember correctly. The irony of naming these horribly deformed street after the luminaries of Russian culture had escaped the victors: they did not realize how offensive it was to the memory of our great Russian authors...|$|E
