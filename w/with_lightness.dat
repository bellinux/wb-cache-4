2500|$|Schonberg has {{assessed}} Rubinstein's piano tone the most sensuous {{of any of}} the great pianists. [...] Fellow pianist Rafael Joseffy compared it to [...] "a golden French horn." [...] Rubinstein himself told an interviewer, [...] "Strength <b>with</b> <b>lightness,</b> that is one secret of my touch.... I have sat hours trying to imitate the timbre of Rubini's voice in my playing." ...|$|E
2500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalized}} rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 80, based on twelve reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". In her review for the Guardian, Harriet Gibsone said {{the album is}} [...] "another triumph for Sundfør, who delivers complex, maudlin subjects <b>with</b> <b>lightness</b> and majesty." [...] Claire Biddles from the Line of Best Fit said [...] "Music for People in Trouble perhaps doesn't have the crossover appeal that Ten Love Songs had, and its head-on engagement with contemporary struggles will certainly not be for everyone. But {{for those who are}} done with escapism, at least for an hour or so, its sustained mood brings rich rewards." [...] writing for the Observer, Emily Mackay said, [...] "as the album's title suggests, Sundfør wishes to pour oil on the choppy waters of a weary world, and the warm clarity of her voice offers beautiful moments of respite." [...] MusicOMHs Sam Shepherd stated that the album [...] "will perhaps be a surprise for those who came to Sundfør via her last album, but they won't be disappointed. This is an album full of hidden depths, stark emotion, and most importantly, absolutely beautiful songs." ...|$|E

40|$|Current study aims {{to explore}} the emotion of “trust ” induced by nail polish colors. Thirty-one {{observers}} were invited {{to take part in}} a psychophysical experiment. Twenty nail colors were provided in the experiment. Each observer was asked to assess the nail color on 8 emotional scales. The results showed that the “trusted ” nail polish colors should be “accepted ” and “not frivolous. ” The models showed that reddish colors <b>with</b> high <b>lightness</b> and low chroma produced “trusted ” colors. A purplish color <b>with</b> high <b>lightness</b> tended to be “accepted ” colors. Olive and bluish colors <b>with</b> high <b>lightness</b> and high chroma were “frivolous. ...|$|R

6000|$|... 4. Take heed thou do not {{use them}} to many chiding words and threatenings, mixed <b>with</b> <b>lightness</b> and laughter; this will harden. Speak not much, nor often, but {{pertinent}} to them with all gravity. 9 ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, don't {{speak of}} that," [...] said Breckon, not very appositely. Presently he forced a laugh, {{in order to}} add, <b>with</b> <b>lightness,</b> [...] "I was afraid perhaps I had given you all some reason to regret it!" ...|$|E

"She is WRONG, my lord," [...] said Allan, sternly, [...] "though you, {{who treat}} <b>with</b> <b>lightness</b> the {{warnings}} I have given you, may {{not live to}} see the event of the omen.--laugh not so scornfully," [...] he added, interrupting himself [...] "or rather laugh on as loud and as long as you will; your term of laughter will find a pause ere long." ...|$|E
60|$|His {{anger was}} justified. Travel in the North, where food is scarce, is a {{question}} of transport. As the traveler must take all he needs with him, his supplies must be carefully regulated in accordance with the distance and his power of carrying them, while an error in his calculations may result in starvation. Knowing this, Carnally and Graham had considered how the weight could be cut down by the use of certain condensed foods, as well as clothing and camp equipment made to combine the greatest warmth <b>with</b> <b>lightness.</b> The goods were expensive, but their value could hardly be reckoned in money.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} jealous when Tertius goes to Lowick," [...] said Rosamond, dimpling, and {{speaking}} <b>with</b> aery <b>lightness.</b> [...] "He {{will come back}} and think nothing of me." ...|$|R

6000|$|It may be added, in conclusion, {{that the}} oars of a {{lifeboat}} are short, and so made as {{to combine the}} greatest possible strength <b>with</b> <b>lightness.</b> They are fastened to the gunwale by short pieces of rope, and work in a moveable iron crutch on an iron thole-pin. Each boat is provided {{with a set of}} spare oars. Her equipment of compass, cables, grapnels, anchors, etcetera, is, as may be supposed, very complete, and she rides upon the storm in a rather gay dress of red, white, and blue, in order that she may be readily distinguished from other boats--her lower parts being white, her upper sides blue, and her line of [...] "fender" [...] all round being scarlet.|$|E
60|$|The {{spring was}} {{pleasant}} there. It {{was a day}} upon which one felt it good merely to live. The young green of the trees was exquisite against the sky; and the sky, pale and blue, was dappled with little white clouds. At {{the end of the}} ornamental water was the gray mass of the Horse Guards. The ordered elegance of the scene had the charm of an eighteenth-century picture. It reminded you not of Watteau, whose landscapes are so idyllic that they recall only the woodland glens seen in dreams, but of the more prosaic Jean-Baptiste Pater. Philip's heart was filled <b>with</b> <b>lightness.</b> He realised, what he had only read before, that art (for there was art {{in the manner in which}} he looked upon nature) might liberate the soul from pain.|$|E
60|$|But verily, I am apt to think, {{that one}} reason of his no more regarding, or remembring of his {{sick-bed}} fears, and of being no better for them, was, some words that the Doctor that supplied him with Physick said {{to him when he}} was mending. For as soon as Mr. Badman began to mend, the Doctor comes and sits him down by him in his house, and there fell into discourse with him about the nature of his disease; and among other things they talked of Badmans trouble, and how he would cry out, tremble, and express his fears of going to Hell when his sickness lay pretty hard upon him. To which the Doctor replyed: {146b} That those fears and Out-cries did arise from the height of his distemper, for that disease was often attended <b>with</b> <b>lightness</b> of the head, by reason the sick party could not sleep, and for that the vapours disturbed the brain: But you see Sir, quoth he, that so soon as you got sleep and betook your self to rest, you quickly mended, and your head settled, and so those frenzies left you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I haven't {{done any}} of the mistrusting," [...] said Bartley, <b>with</b> humorous <b>lightness.</b> [...] "But isn't sacred rather a strong word to use in regard to our marriage, anyway?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... and he too, {{instead of}} that gravity {{and depth of}} tone which might seem most accordant to his subjects, treats them <b>with</b> a <b>lightness</b> of pencil that is not far removed from flimsiness.|$|R

60|$|Then {{understand}} my meaning by my words, How sense of mercy unto faith affords Both grace to sanctify, and holy make That soul that of forgiveness doth partake. Thus having briefly showed you what is The way of life, or sanctity, of bliss, I would not in conclusion have you think, By what I say, that Christian men should drink In these my words <b>with</b> <b>lightness,</b> {{or that they}} Are now exempted from what every day Their duty is. No, God doth still expect, Yea, doth command, {{that they do not}} neglect To pray, to read, to hear, and not dissent From being sober, grave, and diligent In watching, self-denial, and with fear To serve him all the time thou livest here. Indeed I have endeavoured to lay Before your eyes the right and only way Pardon to get, and also holiness, Without which never think that God will bless Thee with the kingdom he will give to those That Christ embrace, and holy lives do choose To live, while here all others go astray, And shall in time to come be cast away.|$|E
6000|$|... 'In this country,' said Sidonia, 'since the peace, {{there has}} been an attempt to {{advocate}} a reconstruction of society on a purely rational basis. The principle of Utility has been powerfully developed. I speak not <b>with</b> <b>lightness</b> of the labours of the disciples of that school. I bow to intellect in every form: and we should be grateful to any school of philosophers, even if we disagree with them; doubly grateful in this country, where for so long a period our statesmen were in so pitiable an arrear of public intelligence. There has been an attempt to reconstruct society on a basis of material motives and calculations. It has failed. It must ultimately have failed under any circumstances; its failure in an ancient and densely-peopled kingdom was inevitable. How limited is human reason, the profoundest inquirers are most conscious. We are not indebted to the Reason of man for any of the great achievements which are the landmarks of human action and human progress. It was not Reason that besieged Troy; it was not Reason that sent forth the Saracen from the Desert to conquer the world; that inspired the Crusades; that instituted the Monastic orders; it was not Reason that produced the Jesuits; above all, it was not Reason that created the French Revolution. Man is only truly great when he acts from the passions; never irresistible but when he appeals to the imagination. Even Mormon counts more votaries than Bentham.' ...|$|E

And it was so indeed, thought Mr. Badman; was my troubles only the effects of my distemper, and because ill vapours got up into my brain? Then surely, since my physician was my saviour, my lust again shall be my god. So he never minded religion more, but betook him again to the world, his lusts and wicked companions: and there was an end of Mr. Badman's conversion.|$|E

60|$|The champions {{formed a}} {{striking}} contrast {{to each other}} in person and features, and might have formed no inaccurate representatives of their different nations. The Frank seemed a powerful man, built after the ancient Gothic cast of form, with light brown hair, which, on the removal of his helmet, was seen to curl thick and profusely over his head. His features had acquired, from the hot climate, a hue much darker than those parts of his neck which were less frequently exposed to view, or than was warranted by his full and well-opened blue eye, the colour of his hair, and of the moustaches which thickly shaded his upper lip, while his chin was carefully divested of beard, after the Norman fashion. His nose was Grecian and well formed; his mouth rather large in proportion, but filled with well-set, strong, and beautifully white teeth; his head small, and set upon the neck with much grace. His age could not exceed thirty, but if the effects of toil and climate were allowed for, might be three or four years under that period. His form was tall, powerful, and athletic, like that of a man whose strength might, in later life, become unwieldy, but which was hitherto united <b>with</b> <b>lightness</b> and activity. His hands, when he withdrew the mailed gloves, were long, fair, and well-proportioned; the wrist-bones peculiarly large and strong; and the arms remarkably well-shaped and brawny. A military hardihood and careless frankness of expression characterized his language and his motions; and his voice had the tone of one more accustomed to command than to obey, and who was in the habit of expressing his sentiments aloud and boldly, whenever he was called upon to announce them.|$|E

50|$|The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali also deal <b>with</b> <b>Lightness.</b> Book 3 {{describes}} Lightness or Laghima {{as being}} one of the eight siddhis, or eight perfections: the capacity to offset the force of one's facticity.
