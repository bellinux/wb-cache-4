This is more common in locations having limited wastewater treatment infrastructure, or where there are systematic failures of the on-site sewage disposal system. Along with pathogens and nutrients, untreated sewage can also have an important load of heavy metals that may seep into the groundwater system.|$|E
25|$|Federally {{recognized}} Indigenous Nations {{and states}} protect designated areas by adopting {{water quality criteria}} {{that allow them to}} adopt the criteria that EPA publishes under §304(a) of the CWA, modify the §304(a) criteria to reflect site-specific conditions or adopt criteria based on other scientifically defensible methods. Water quality criteria can be numeric criteria that toxicity causes are known for protection against pollutants. A narrative criterion is water quality criteria which serves as basis for limiting toxicity of <b>waste</b> <b>discharge</b> to aquatic species. A biological criterion is based on aquatic community which describes the number and types of species in a water body. A nutrient criterion solely protects against nutrient over enrichment; and a sediment criterion describes conditions of contaminated and uncontaminated sediments in order to avoid undesirable effects.|$|E
2500|$|Sodium {{hydroxide}} {{is frequently}} {{used as an}} industrial cleaning agent where it is often called [...] "caustic". It is added to water, heated, and then used to clean process equipment, storage tanks, etc. It can dissolve grease, oils, fats and protein-based deposits. It is also used for cleaning <b>waste</b> <b>discharge</b> pipes under sinks and drains in domestic properties. Surfactants {{can be added to}} the sodium hydroxide solution in order to stabilize dissolved substances and thus prevent redeposition. A sodium hydroxide soak solution is used as a powerful degreaser on stainless steel and glass bakeware. It is also a common ingredient in oven cleaners.|$|E

Discharges from B-Plant to other cribs, unplanned releases, or waste remaining in tanks are not included in the report. Waste stream composition information is used to predict quantities of individual chemicals sent to cribs. This provides an accurate mass balance of waste streams from B-Plant to these cribs.

2500|$|Low-level {{radioactive}} waste has been discharged into the Irish Sea {{as part of}} operations at Sellafield since 1952. The rate of discharge began to accelerate in the mid- to late 1960s, reaching a peak in the 1970s and generally declining significantly since then. As {{an example of this}} profile, discharges of plutonium (specifically 241Pu) peaked in 1973 at [...] falling to [...] by 2004.
