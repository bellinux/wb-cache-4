25|$|In 2002, Murakami {{published}} the anthology Birthday Stories, which collects short {{stories on the}} theme of birthdays. The collection includes work by Russell Banks, Ethan Canin, Raymond Carver, David Foster Wallace, Denis Johnson, Claire Keegan, Andrea Lee, Daniel Lyons, Lynda Sexson, Paul Theroux, and William Trevor, as well as a story by Murakami himself. What I Talk About When I Talk About Running, containing tales about his experience as a marathon runner and a triathlete, was published in Japan in 2007, with English translations released in the U.K. and the U.S. in 2008. The title is a play on that of Raymond Carver's short story collection, What <b>We</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>About</b> When <b>We</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>About</b> Love.|$|E

25|$|When <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> a {{permanent}} vegetative state, I am offended by that. Terri smiles and acknowledges {{the people that}} love her {{when they come to}} see her. She cries when they leave. How heartless are we to call somebody like Terri Schiavo a vegetable? What are we thinking?When we think about this case, we need to think about the message that we are sending to our children and our grandchildren. What we do in this Chamber tonight is as important as anything we have done in defending our Nation, in doing the things that we do as Members of Congress.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong's {{theory of}} {{universals}} {{gives him the}} basis for an understanding of laws of nature as being relations between universals, a non-Humean account of laws of nature proposed independently by Armstrong, Michael Tooley, and Fred Dretske. This account posits that the relations between universals are truthmakers for the statements about physical laws, and it is realist as it accepts that laws of nature are {{a feature of the}} world rather than just a way <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the world. Armstrong identifies the laws as holding between universals rather than particulars as an account of laws involving just particulars rather than universals would not adequately explain how laws of nature operate in the case of counterfactuals.|$|E
500|$|Whenever we work {{together}} she always sits with me and listens to the song, and says [...] "tell me what this song is about to you." [...] She's very methodical in her thinking. <b>We</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it, she writes down words that I say describing what the song's about and the sentiment that I'd like her to get out there, and then she goes away and she works on it. She writes it, she comes back. She does a version of it, <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it. It's a back and forth until she gets it right. It's a total collaboration.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Iran's Press TV (which was subsequently posted online on 11 April 2013), Choudary stated [...] "As Muslims, we reject democracy, we reject secularism, and freedom, and human rights. We reject {{all of the things}} that you espouse as being ideals ... There is nothing called a republic in Islam. When <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the shari'a, we are talking about only the shari'a. We are talking about rejecting the U.N., the IMF, and the World Bank." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics noted {{similarities}} {{among the}} structures of [...] "Rehab" [...] and some of Timberlake's songs, such as [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around" [...] and [...] "Cry Me a River". Spence D. of IGN wrote that the song has an [...] "R swoon", similar to Rihanna's previous singles. In an interview with Margeaux Watson for Entertainment Weekly, Rihanna explained {{the meaning of the}} song's lyrics: [...] "'Rehab' is a metaphorical song. Rehab really just means we have to get over the guy. So <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> checking ourselves into rehab, meaning we have to get over him. And we compare the guy to a disease or an addiction." [...] Watson further called the song a [...] "lovesick ballad".|$|E
500|$|In {{the next}} round of the competition, Berg {{attempted}} another jump but was not as fortunate this time: he fell out of the air, just as before, and crashed almost identically to Findeisen. One of Berg's skis, which had come loose after impact and was still attached to his foot, flailed around and hit him in the face – exposed due to his goggles detaching – as he was sliding to a stop. His injuries, including concussion and a broken ACL, were career-ending. At this point, Trautwig began calling into question the nature of the sport: [...] "Jeff, <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the fear and why the ski flyers are scared... I'm really starting to ask, why we're here and why they're doing it." ...|$|E

500|$|Later, {{a survey}} of Malaysians found that 55% of {{respondents}} agreed politicians should be [...] "blamed for segregating the people by playing racial politics". Mukhriz Mahathir — Mahathir's son and an UMNO Youth leader — defended UMNO's actions because of economic disparities, insisting that [...] "As long as that remains, {{there will always be}} people to champion each race to equalise things." [...] Shahrir Abdul Samad, the chairman of the BN Backbenchers' Club, argued that politicians were simply responding to [...] "a country ... divided into different races," [...] asking, [...] "if you talk about Malay issues to the Malay community, is that playing racial politics?" [...] M. Kayveas, the President of the PPP, disagreed: [...] "Every 12 months, the parties go back to one race championing their own causes and, {{at the end of the}} day, when the general election comes, <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> 'Bangsa Malaysia'." ...|$|E
500|$|Co-showrunner Wyman {{also served}} as episode director, marking his {{television}} directorial debut. He noted his love of the experience, as it permitted him to grow closer with the series' actors and [...] "actually work with them on a level that [...] before and really get down there with them." [...] Wyman was originally supposed to direct several episodes the previous year and earlier in the season, but found he was too busy. He explained, [...] "Then an episode was coming up that we were thinking about writing and I really felt close to it. [...] The opportunity came up where somebody had fallen out and I felt {{that this is the}} perfect time because everything was completely under control. [...] It allowed me to go and do it. [...] It's an episode that's really close to me. [...] It's about love and it's about all the great things that <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> on Fringe." ...|$|E
500|$|A film {{based on}} the Runaways went {{through a number of}} iterations. Brian K. Vaughan was {{originally}} hired to write a screenplay {{based on the}} property in May 2008. In April 2010, Marvel hired Peter Sollett to direct the film, and Drew Pearce was hired to write a script in May. The following October, development on the film was put on hold, with Pearce revealing in September 2013 that the Runaways film had been shelved in favor of The Avengers, with the earliest it could release being Phase Three. In October 2014, after announcing all of Marvel's Phase Three films without Runaways, Feige stated the project was [...] "still an awesome script that exists in our script vault", adding, [...] "We'd love to do something with Runaways some day. In our television and future film discussions, it's always one that <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> because we have a solid draft there. But again, we can't make them all." [...] In August 2016, Marvel Television announced Marvel's Runaways from the streaming service Hulu, with the series receiving a full season order in May 2017. It is scheduled to premiere in November 2017.|$|E

500|$|Cotto and Margarito's {{aggressive}} boxing styles led to much speculation of {{a potential}} fight of the year candidate. Junior welterweight titleholder Paulie Malignaggi said that the fight would be [...] "pure entertainment", and HBO commentator Jim Lampley said that [...] "I'm asking for one of my top 10fights in my 22years of calling fights on television". Dave Larzelere of Sporting News wrote that the bout had [...] "the potential {{to be one of}} those epic Irresistible Force vs. Immoveable Object kind of battles that <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> forever afterwards, à la Hagler/Hearns or Corrales/Castillo". Jeff Haney of the Las Vegas Sun described the fight as [...] "not only the sport’s most promising matchup of the year. It also conjures memories of past fights in which regional or national pride was at stake", noting the rivalry between Mexico and Puerto Rico. The Arizona Republic wrote, [...] "Cotto, an impassive and intimidating Puerto Rican, and Margarito, a patient and tough Mexican, are another chapter in a rivalry rich in legends and still productive". Yahoo! Sports writer Kevin Iole felt that the boxing match would provide a performance similar to that of the fight between Jose Luis Castillo and Diego Corrales, which was named fight of the year by The Ring magazine.|$|E
500|$|The forced {{merger of}} Gulf and Chevron was controversial, with the U.S. Senate {{considering}} legislation to freeze oil industry mergers for a year—before the Reagan administration made it known it opposed government {{intervention in the}} matter and would veto any bill. [...] However, Pickens and Lee (Gulf's CEO) were summoned {{to testify before the}} Senate months before the merger was hammered out and the matter was referred to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC only approved the deal subject to strict conditions. Never before had a [...] "small operator" [...] successfully taken apart a Fortune 500 corporation, or in Gulf's case a [...] "Fortune 10" [...] corporation. The merger sent even deeper shock waves through the long-time exclusive [...] "Seven Sisters" [...] club of major integrated oil companies that defined themselves as elevated from the [...] "non-major independents". A board member of Exxon even admitted in the mid-1980s that [...] "mostly all <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> in board meetings anymore is T. Boone Pickens". [...] Chevron, to settle with the government antitrust requirements, sold some Gulf stations and a refinery in the eastern United States to British Petroleum (BP) and Cumberland Farms in 1985 {{as well as some of}} the international operations.|$|E
500|$|While non-Chinese analysts {{generally}} {{agree that}} the CCP has rejected orthodox Marxism–Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought (or at least basic thoughts within orthodox thinking), the CCP itself disagrees. Certain groups argue that Jiang Zemin ended the CCP's formal commitment to Marxism {{with the introduction of}} the ideological theory, the Three Represents. However, party theorist Leng Rong disagrees, claiming that [...] "President Jiang rid the Party of the ideological obstacles to different kinds of ownership [...] He did not give up Marxism or socialism. He strengthened the Party by providing a modern understanding of Marxism and socialism—which is why <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> a 'socialist market economy' with Chinese characteristics." [...] The attainment of true [...] "communism" [...] is still described as the CCP's and China's [...] "ultimate goal". While the CCP claims that China is in the primary stage of socialism, party theorists argue that the current development stage [...] "looks a lot like capitalism". Alternatively, certain party theorists argue that [...] "capitalism is the early or first stage of communism." [...] Some have dismissed the concept of a primary stage of socialism as intellectual cynicism. According to Robert Lawrence Kuhn, a China analyst, [...] "When I first heard this rationale, I thought it more comic than clever—a wry caricature of hack propagandists leaked by intellectual cynics. But the 100-year horizon comes from serious political theorists".|$|E
