5|$|The {{remnants}} of Arthur re-intensified somewhat as it traversed The Maritimes; a sting jet with gusts of 65–80mph (100–130km/h) developed along the storm's backside. The former hurricane made an additional landfall {{in the region}} near Fundy National Park by 18:00UTC. By July6, the sting jet had dissipated, and steady <b>weakening</b> of the cyclone resumed as only a split jet provided upper-level support to the storm. Turning back to the northeast, Arthur moved through Labrador later that day. Once over the Labrador Sea, Arthur turned northwest while <b>weakening</b> before doubling back to the southeast. After <b>weakening</b> below gale-force strength, the extratropical system dissipated late on July9.|$|E

The typhoon crossed 30° north at noon on August 10 and <b>weakened</b> to a severe tropical storm soon afterwards, because of unfavorable sea surface temperature and expanding subsidence.

5|$|A slow <b>weakening</b> trend began {{early on}} September 27 {{due to the}} {{increased}} shear while remaining on a west-northwest track. At the same time, the center of circulation became exposed at times due to the southwesterly wind shear. As a result, an unusual wind field was observed in that the strongest winds were recorded well {{to the east and}} to the northwest of the center. The <b>weakening</b> trend remained fairly slow that evening as the storm continued to produce persistent deep convection. The <b>weakening</b> trend accelerated on September 28 as the convection weakened and the circulation became more disorganized in the high-shear environment. By that morning, Karen weakened to a minimal tropical storm with 40mph (65km/h) winds. Karen also turned abruptly to the north for a short while, as convection interacted with the low-level center and southerly winds increased in the low-level environment. The <b>weakening</b> trend slowed that afternoon as deep convection returned to the disorganized storm. Early on September 29, the high wind shear continued and Karen weakened to a tropical depression with a very poorly defined center. That afternoon, the circulation dissipated while east of the Lesser Antilles. Remnant squalls continued across the area east of the Lesser Antilles for a few days after dissipation.|$|E
5|$|A <b>weakening</b> trend soon occurred, with it <b>weakening</b> to a Category1 {{hurricane}} {{early on}} September15. About four days later, the hurricane completed its cyclonic loop and then headed west-northwestward. The system weakened to {{a tropical storm}} early on September20. During the next few days, the storm decelerated and turned westward. Late on September22, it weakened to a tropical depression. The depression continued westward, until dissipating at 1800UTC on September23, while located about 745 miles (1,200km) east-southeast of Bermuda.|$|E

5|$|After {{maintaining}} Category5 {{status for}} about 12hours, Ivan began a steady <b>weakening</b> trend due to another eyewall replacement cycle until reaching winds of 140mph (225km/h) on September 10. Early next day, the hurricane reorganized as it reached winds {{just shy of}} Category5 status. However, <b>weakening</b> occurred again due to an eyewall replacement cycle, and at 0330UTC on September 11 Ivan passed 23miles (37km) south of Portland Point, Jamaica, its closest approach, with winds of 150mph (240km/h). The hurricane was previously forecast to make landfall on the island, though the <b>weakening</b> and a turn to the west kept the strongest winds offshore; however, sustained winds of Category4 status were reported. While passing {{to the south of}} the island, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall, with several stations reporting over 2feet (60cm) of precipitation. Ivan's last-minute turn to the west was due to a mid-level high pressure system over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. A slight <b>weakening</b> trend continued after passing the island, due to its northern outflow being disrupted by an upper-level low over the Bahamas. As it tracked further away from Jamaica, Ivan again rapidly intensified to Category5 status, and early on September 12 it reached its peak intensity of 165mph (265km/h) with a pressure of 910mbar (26.87inHg).|$|E
5|$|After {{maintaining}} its peak intensity for about 24hours, Kyle began <b>weakening</b> on September27 as increased upper-level shear restricted outflow and distorted the convection envelope; drier air {{also contributed to}} the <b>weakening.</b> On September 28, after turning west-northwestward, the hurricane weakened to tropical storm status, and by the next day the center had become devoid of deep convection. A trough passing to its north and a developing ridge to its west left the storm nearly stationary for several days. The <b>weakening</b> rate of Kyle was temporarily halted when thunderstorms redeveloped on September29 and again early the next day, though late on September30 the storm weakened to tropical depression status. The circulation had become elongated from northeast to southwest. The northeastern portion became associated with the approaching frontal zone, and was briefly monitored for signs of development. However, the southwestern portion redeveloped convection and became the dominant circulation.|$|E
