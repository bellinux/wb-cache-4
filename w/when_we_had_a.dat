500|$|Biographers Morecambe and Stirling {{believe that}} Cary Grant was the [...] "greatest leading man Hollywood had ever known". Schickel stated {{that there are}} [...] "very few stars who achieve the {{magnitude}} of Cary Grant, art of a very high and subtle order", and {{thought that he was}} the [...] "best star actor there ever was in the movies". David Thomson and directors Stanley Donen and Howard Hawks concurred that Grant was the greatest and most important actor {{in the history of the}} cinema. He was a favorite of Hitchcock, who admired him and called him [...] "the only actor I ever loved in my whole life", and remained one of Hollywood's top box-office attractions for almost 30 years. Wansell wrote: [...] "To millions of movie-goers around the world, Cary Grant will forever epitomize the glamour, and the style, of Hollywood in its golden years. With his dark hair, and even darker eyes, mischievous smile and effortless elegance, he was, is, and always will be indelibly one of the great movie stars. Since his death in 1986, the incandescence of his screen image has not dimmed for a single moment". Kael stated that the world still thinks of him affectionately, because he [...] "embodies what seems a happier time−a time <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> simpler relationship to a performer." ...|$|E

[...] "We in Catania, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> problem with the judiciary, we would turn to the local Masonic head. We knew that many magistrates were lodge members and that, thanks to the local chief, we could even interfere with ongoing criminal proceedings," [...] Calderone said.|$|E
2500|$|At Kennedy's death, {{there were}} 16,000 American {{military}} personnel stationed in Vietnam; these personnel supported South Vietnam in the Vietnam War against North Vietnam. Vietnam had been partitioned at the 1954 Geneva Conference into two countries, with North Vietnam {{led by a}} Communist government. Johnson subscribed to the Domino Theory in Vietnam and to a containment policy that required America to make a serious effort to stop all Communist expansion. On taking office, Johnson immediately reversed Kennedy's order to withdraw 1,000 military personnel {{by the end of}} 1963. In late summer 1964, Johnson seriously questioned the value of staying in Vietnam but, after meeting with Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Maxwell D. Taylor, declared his readiness [...] "to do more <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> base" [...] or when Saigon was politically more stable. He expanded the numbers and roles of the American military following the Gulf of Tonkin Incident.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s {{computer}} programming was {{in state of}} crisis. Software crisis is a term used {{in the early days}} of computing science for the difficulty of writing useful and efficient computer programs in the required time. The software crisis was due to the rapid increases in computer power and the complexity of the problems that could be tackled. With the increase in the complexity of the software, many software problems arose because existing methods were neither sufficient nor up to the mark. The term [...] "software crisis" [...] was coined by some attendees at the first NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968 at Garmisch, Germany. His 1972 ACM Turing Award Lecture makes reference to this same problem: [...] "The major cause of the software crisis is that the machines have become several orders of magnitude more powerful! To put it quite bluntly: as long as there were no machines, programming was no problem at all; <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> few weak computers, programming became a mild problem, and now we have gigantic computers, programming has become an equally gigantic problem." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1976, Balderstone {{was called}} into the England Test team to make his {{international}} debut aged 35 having focused in his younger days on football. Against other international sides he might have played more Tests, for he was chosen {{on the strength of}} consistent quality performances for Leicestershire. It was his misfortune, however, to come up against the West Indies just as they were reaching that level of intimidation they were to maintain for the next two decades. Against the fearsome pace of Andy Roberts and Michael Holding he struggled, like so many other English batsmen: his four innings produced only 39 runs. He did though score 35 from sticking it out for 3½ hours at the crease on his test debut. In his second test, at a parched Oval, he encountered Michael Holding and one of the finest individual fast-bowling performances in history – Holding took 14 wickets in the test. [...] Opposing fast bowler Vanburn Holder later said, [...] "I played against him <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> pretty ferocious attack and he never blinked. He had plenty of courage." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2007 Rogue Traders {{released}} {{their third}} album, Better in the Dark, which spawned the hit singles [...] "Don't You Wanna Feel" [...] and [...] "I Never Liked You"—both were certified gold, and [...] "What You're On". The album debuted on the ARIA Albums Chart at numberfour and gained a platinum accreditation. For this album, Bassingthwaighte is credited as a co-composer for five of its twelve tracks, including all three singles. She worked with Ash {{and his wife}} Melinda Appleby on some tracks, [...] "e'd sit {{in a room and}} throw ideas around … It was interesting that all three of us instinctively knew <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> great idea". At the APRA Awards of 2009, [...] "Don't You Wanna Feel" [...] was nominated as Dance Work of the Year. In June 2008, Bassingthwaighte left the group to pursue her solo career. She had signed a recording contract with Sony Music Australia in 2006 to embark on a solo career. In November 2009, Rogue Traders recruited Mindi Jackson as her replacement.|$|E
