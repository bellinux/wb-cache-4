Many of them came back to Aspen after the war, helping to expand and staff the ski resort. Coincidentally, Walter Paepcke, head of the Container Corporation of America, visited Aspen with his wife Elizabeth in the late 1940s, and found it an ideal place to establish a music festival they were planning. He invested heavily in the city's redevelopment, and people began coming to Aspen again to live, <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>play.</b> While the Rio Grande's trains still ran, many new visitors and arrivals preferred to drive.|$|E

25|$|As {{part of his}} recovery, Dr. Jacobson advised Munch to only {{socialize with}} good friends and avoid {{drinking}} in public. Munch followed this advice {{and in the process}} produced several full-length portraits of high quality of friends and patrons—honest portrayals devoid of flattery. He also created landscapes and scenes of people at <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>play,</b> using a new optimistic style—broad, loose brushstrokes of vibrant color with frequent use of white space and rare use of black—with only occasional references to his morbid themes. With more income, Munch was able to buy several properties giving him new vistas for his art and he was finally able to provide for his family.|$|E
25|$|Davidson {{argues that}} as a culture, our {{attention}} blindness represents a significant challenge that we must examine and meet head on; particularly since the Internet has revolutionized virtually every aspect of how our lives function now. The Internet, Davidson suggests, has catapulted us into an immediate, collaborative, and interconnected existence that {{is characterized by the}} sudden breakdown of barriers between private and public, <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>play,</b> domestic and foreign, office and home, etc. Davidson notes that although our lives have been irrevocably altered in these fundamental ways, our most important educational, corporate, and social institutions have not substantially changed in correlation with these upheavals. She claims that those in educational and corporate spheres continue to operate in 20th century modes (founded {{to meet the challenges of}} industrialization) as though we were currently not living through momentous, epochal changes.|$|E

25|$|Clerk and {{his fellow}} Caribbean missionaries were self-motivated and adapted quickly despite the initial {{homesickness}} and learnt the indigenous languages of Akan and Ga. The missionaries composed new local language hymns, translated church hymns into Ga and Akan from English and German, built stone houses, wells and schools, set up large farms and taught the local people {{to read and write}} vastly improving literacy in the region. In 1848, thirty-seven girls, twenty-five boys and seven children of the West Indians attended the newly set-up, United Akropong School with Clerk as a founding schoolmaster. The West Indian children who were taught at the school included Andrew Hall, Rosina Miller, Robert Miller, Catherine Miller, Elizabeth Mullings, Ann Rochester and John Rochester. The girls’ school was later transferred to Aburi in 1854 to become the Girls’ Senior School, predecessor to the present-day Aburi Girls’ Secondary School. Clerk and other missionaries also trained native catechists to help them in their evangelical <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> significant roles in the Basel Mission at the then newly established Basel Mission Training College in 1848 (now Presbyterian Training College of Education) as the second oldest higher educational institution in West Africa after Fourah Bay College (founded in 1827) in Freetown, Sierra Leone.|$|E
25|$|Women’s {{participation}} on {{the home}} front was essential to the war effort. Leading into the Second World War, the ‘breadwinner model’ indicated that married women belonged in the home, with men working. Men were supposed to <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> in the public domain with the private realm supposedly being the domain of women. The outbreak of World War II forced society to rethink women’s role outside of the home. The largest contribution by the majority of Canadian women was through unpaid volunteer work, through their domestic abilities and skills; women were able to support the nation and the war effort. The government called upon women to participate in volunteer programs. Women began collecting recycled items such as paper, metal, fat, bones, rags, rubber, and glass. Clothing was also collected by Canadian women for free distribution overseas. They also prepared care packages to send to the men and women overseas. Canadian women were responsible for maintaining the morale of the nation. All over Canada, women responded to demands made upon them by not only selling war savings stamps and certificates but purchasing them as well, and collecting money to by bombers and mobile canteens. If you were a young unattached woman in 1939, the war offered unprecedented opportunities {{on the home}} front. Young women were given a chance to move away from home, go to parties and dances in the name of patriotic duty.|$|E

500|$|Ghosts of Onyx author Eric Nylund had {{previously}} written {{two of the}} three past Halo novels, [...] and , and went to Halos developer Bungie with an outline of {{what he wanted to do}} next.

However, he acknowledged the difficulty of fitting his story into the rest of the Halo universe was far greater for Ghosts of Onyx than the other novels as more of the story had been made public and was no longer able to be modified. Nylund mentioned in an interview with IGN that writing a Halo novel had both its positive aspects and drawbacks. [...] "It's better because I have all these great toys and characters to play with," [...] Nylund stated in an interview, [...] "It's not so good because I have to <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> well with other parts of the intellectual property so everything meshes." ...|$|E
500|$|Winkelman had not {{intended}} to own Wimbledon F.C. himself; his plan had been to work alongside it while the stadium was built in Denbigh and then give the ground to the club in exchange for shares and {{a place on the}} board. He had not expected it to go into administration. With the move threatened and the club facing liquidation, he made [...] "the life-defining decision", to quote Conn, [...] "of taking it on himself". He secured funds from his consortium for the administrators to pay the players' wages, keep the club operating, and pay for the necessary renovations for the National Hockey Stadium to host League football. He made clear that his group's interest was conditional on the club moving to Milton Keynes. In late July Winkelman and the club's administrators concluded a deal with the Hockey Stadium's owners to carry out conversion <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> there from October—Wimbledon F.C. would return to Selhurst Park in the meantime.

500|$|The same year, {{the comedian}} lent {{his name and}} writing talents to Dan Leno's Comic Journal. The paper was {{primarily}} aimed at young adults and featured a mythologised version of Leno– the first comic paper to take its name from, and base a central character on, a living person. [...] Published by C. Arthur Pearson, Issue No. 1 appeared on 26 February 1898, and the paper sold 350,000 copies a year. Leno wrote most of the paper's comic stories and jokes, and Tom Browne contributed many of the illustrations. The comedian retained editorial control of the paper, deciding which items to omit. The Journal was known for its slogans, including [...] "One Touch of Leno Makes the Whole World Grin" [...] and [...] "Won't wash clothes but will mangle melancholy". [...] The cover always showed a caricature of Leno and his editorial staff at <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>play.</b> Inside, the features included [...] "Daniel's Diary", [...] "Moans from the Martyr", two yarns, {{a couple of dozen}} cartoons and [...] "Leno's Latest– Fresh Jokes and Wheezes Made on the Premises".

500|$|Meredith's {{performances}} for Northwich {{gained the}} attention of several other clubs in the Football League. Bolton Wanderers full-back Di Jones, a former Chirk player, spoke with him about a possible move, but Bolton secretary J.J. Bentley felt Meredith was too inexperienced and his frame too slight. Lawrence Furniss, an official at Ardwick, had first noticed him while refereeing a Northwich match. Meredith also played in both meetings between the clubs that season. Later in 1894, Ardwick, by then known as Manchester City, vigorously pursued Meredith's signature. Two club officials travelled to Wales to meet the player. One was secretary-manager Joshua Parlby, the other either Furniss or chairman John Chapman. The pair were met with suspicion. Anecdotes by contemporary figures suggest they were initially chased away by locals, and were only allowed to speak to Meredith after they bought drinks for his mining colleagues. Meredith {{did not wish to}} abandon life in Chirk. His mother was particularly against the idea: [...] "It is all very well for you gentlemen to leave your big cities and come to our villages to steal our boys away... Our boys are happy and healthy, satisfied with their work and innocent amusements... if Billy takes my advice he will stick to his <b>work</b> <b>and</b> <b>play</b> football for his own amusement when work is finished." [...] Meredith did eventually sign for Manchester City, but as an amateur. He continued to work at the pit for at least a year, commuting back and forth for matches.|$|E

2500|$|Urban {{society is}} {{typically}} stratified. Spatially, cities are formally or informally segregated along ethnic, economic and racial lines.

While in the USA and elsewhere poverty became associated with the inner city, in France it has become associated with the banlieues, areas of urban development which surround the city proper. Meanwhile, across Europe and North America, the racially white majority is empirically the most segregated group. Suburbs in the west, and, increasingly, gated communities {{and other forms of}} [...] "privatopia" [...] around the world, allow local elites to self-segregate into secure and exclusive neighborhoods.|$|E
