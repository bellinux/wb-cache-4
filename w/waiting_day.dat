60|$|Mrs. Woodward's heart melted {{within her}} when she heard that Harry was really ill. She had gone on <b>waiting</b> <b>day</b> after day for an answer to her letter, but no answer came. No answer came, but in lieu thereof she heard that Harry was laid up at Normansgrove. She heard it, and Gertrude heard it, {{and in spite of}} the coming wedding there was very little joy at Surbiton Cottage.|$|E
60|$|It was a <b>waiting</b> <b>day</b> at Fort Chippewayan. The lonesome, far-northern Hudson's Bay Trading Post seldom saw such life. Tepees {{dotted the}} banks of the Slave River and lines of {{blanketed}} Indians paraded its shores. Near the boat landing a group of chiefs, grotesque in semi-barbaric, semicivilized splendor, but black-browed, austere-eyed, stood in savage dignity with folded arms and high-held heads. Lounging on the grassy bank were white men, traders, trappers and officials of the post.|$|E

During Mrs. Vanstone's fatal illness, you addressed {{a letter to}} me, making certain inquiries; which, while she lived, {{it was impossible for}} me to answer. Her deplorable death releases me from the restraint which I had imposed on myself, and permits--or, more properly, obliges me to speak. You shall know what serious reasons I had for <b>waiting</b> <b>day</b> and night in the hope of obtaining that interview which unhappily never took place; and in justice to Mr. Vanstone's memory, your own eyes shall inform you that he made his will." ...|$|E
6000|$|Wednesday last, Mrs. Coleridge, as she may, perhaps, herself have {{informed}} you or Lady Beaumont, {{received a}} letter from Coleridge. I happened to be at Keswick when it arrived; and she has sent it over to us to-day. I will transcribe the most material parts of it, first assuring you, to remove anxiety on your part, that the contents are, we think, upon the whole, promising. He begins thus (date, June 5. 1804, Tuesday noon; Dr. Stoddart's, Malta):--'I landed, in more than usual health, in the harbour of Valetta, about four o'clock, Friday afternoon, April 18. Since then I have been <b>waiting,</b> <b>day</b> after day, for the departure of Mr. Laing, tutor of the only child of Sir A. Ball, our civil governor.' ...|$|E
60|$|To rekindle {{the spark}} that had nearly flickered out, to nourish the little life and {{vitality}} that remained in her, was Venters's problem. But {{he had little}} resource other than the meat of the rabbits and quail; and from these he made broths and soups as best he could, and fed her with a spoon. It came {{to him that the}} human body, like the human soul, was a strange thing and capable of recovering from terrible shocks. For almost immediately she showed faint signs of gathering strength. There was one more <b>waiting</b> <b>day,</b> in which he doubted, and spent long hours by her side as she slept, and watched the gentle swell of her breast rise and fall in breathing, and the wind stir the tangled chestnut curls. On the next day he knew that she would live.|$|E

50|$|The Roar {{is now at}} the {{forefront}} of her siege attack on Coldharbour and the Protector has been revived from the ocean floor, although it was fatally wounded by The Roar and Carnac in their last battle. To defeat The Roar and her two newborns, Helen must discover The Roar's weaknesses while Jenny transforms into a weapon to defeat The Roar, with the aid of Thomas' beauty. Deep down, the Unearthers are <b>waiting</b> <b>day</b> and night for Carnac, who awaits his mother's call for him to attack. Upon surfacing, Carnac is distracted by the Unearthers' but was quickly slain by the Protector with a swipe of his enormous arm - the only part of his body that the twins' and their helpers could free. However, Milo and the Protector are severely injured by The Roar but Helen manages to find out The Roar's weaknesses. Jenny then proceeds to defeat the Roar, banishing her to the Moon. Despite Thomas' and the twins' best efforts to save the Protector, the gigantic silver being dies - though his last thought was in awe of Thomas and his beauty, which was perhaps even enough to save him if time had permitted. The children soon realize that, with the Protectors being nearly extinct, they are to serve as the new generation of defenders who will stand against and hunt beings like the Roar, saving other planets from impending doom.|$|E
40|$|Short-term {{sick leave}} can become costly for {{companies}} in Sweden {{and is a}} high debated HR problem. Since 1992 the companies in Sweden {{are responsible for the}} sick pay of the short-term sick leave, referring to the first 14 days of sickness, with day one as <b>waiting</b> <b>day.</b> Many companies have increased their interest and awareness of short-term sick leave with purpose to reduce their related costs. This thesis contains a cross sectional research with a quantitative and qualitative study of elected warehouses where permanent employed blue collar workers with logistic and sometimes heavy physical work and often shift work works. The purpose with the research is to analyze how the short-term sick leave rates differ in comparable warehouses to company A unit A 2 at the rural area and unit A 1 located at a small city within logistic area. To find out which the strategies are used to minimize short-term sick leave rate in warehouses with already low or high rate of leave? The study is from a company perspective and predominantly focuses on how the HR management and how the management handles the short-term sick leave among the elected companies. Interviews are done with HR representatives and hence all information is coming from those representatives. Therefore it is an appreciation from the HR department how they found working situation for their co-workers. Individual differences, leadership and organizational changes, creates differences and tend to influence the individual co-worker very much according to the HR representatives, hence educations and strategic procedures that increase relations between co-worker and management are encouraged. Reasonable working groups are recommended, since one manager just has the capacity {{to take care of a}} certain amount of co-workers...|$|E
