25|$|The GEAC cleared Bt brinjal for commercialization on 14 October 2009. Following {{concerns}} {{raised by}} some scientists, farmers and anti-GMO activists, {{the government of}} India officially announced on 9 February 2010 that it needed more time before releasing Bt brinjal, with Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh {{saying that there is}} no overriding urgency to introduce Bt brinjal in India. On 17 February 2010, Jairam Ramesh reiterated that the Centre had only imposed a moratorium on the release of transgenic brinjal hybrid, and not a permanent ban, saying that “until <b>we</b> <b>arrive</b> at a political, scientific and societal consensus, this moratorium will remain”. Companies with any seeds of Bt brinjal will have to register the details with the government, and the National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (NBPGR) was made responsible for storage of all the Bt brinjal seeds in India. Independent testing labs are currently being set up.|$|E

500|$|Crewmen aboard Minas Geraes began {{planning}} for a revolt years before 1910, according to João Cândido Felisberto, an experienced sailor who would later become {{the leader of the}} Revolt of the Lash. The conspirators were motivated by the treatment of enlisted men in the Brazilian Navy, extending beyond the lash to even their substandard food, which led to not-uncommon outbreaks of beriberi. Some had formed a committee and had been meeting secretly for years in Rio de Janeiro. This semi-formal organization was only expanded when they were sent to Newcastle in the United Kingdom for training—the operation of such large and complex warships required specific skills. When interviewed years after the mutiny, Felisberto said that they [...] "maintained the committees in the very hotels where we were residing, awaiting the construction of the ships. Almost two years paid by the Brazilian government, we sent messengers to sound out the situation here [...] We did this so that when <b>we</b> <b>arrive,</b> we would be prepared to act"—they were just [...] "waiting for a date and for power," [...] referring to the brand-new warships.|$|E
500|$|In 2003 Bullen made {{a journey}} to Perth's Small Screen Big Picture. On the return leg, after 12 hours of seeing nothing but the Nullarbor Plain through the train window, he began {{developing}} a short subject on infidelity at television conferences. The short, entitled Amorality Tale, which marked Bullen's directorial debut, was screened at various film festivals in 2005, and was {{a finalist for the}} first Rosemount Diamond at the Jackson Hole Film Festival. On the themes of the film, Bullen said, [...] "What has always interested me is the notion of ordinary people and how they react in ordinary situations [...] what fascinated me is the way <b>we</b> <b>arrive</b> at the choices we make. The idea of this film is to say that the choices we make might not lead to the outcomes we expect." [...] He formerly expressed interest in directing an episode of Cold Feet, but decided against it on the basis that his inexperience would make him [...] "inadequate" [...] and that the job was best left to professional directors. The short was produced by Pommie Granite Productions, a company set up by Bullen after his exclusive contract with Granada ended in September 2004. At the end of 2004, he became the seventh person to rewrite the script of the DreamWorks/Aardman Animations film Tortoise vs. Hare. He made at least three drafts.|$|E
