5|$|Solanas {{said that}} she {{regularly}} suffered sexual abuse {{at the hands of}} her father. Her parents divorced when she was young, and her mother remarried shortly afterwards. Solanas disliked her stepfather and began rebelling against her mother, becoming a truant. As a child, she wrote insults for children to use on one another, for the cost of a dime. She beat up a boy in high school who <b>was</b> <b>bothering</b> a younger girl, and also hit a nun. Because of her rebellious behavior, her mother sent her to be raised by her grandparents in 1949. Solanas said that her grandfather was a violent alcoholic who often beat her. When she was 15, she left her grandparents and became homeless. In 1953, she gave birth to a son, fathered by a married sailor. The child, named David (later David Blackwell by adoption), was taken away from Solanas and she never saw him again.|$|E
25|$|Later that evening, Crater {{went to a}} Broadway ticket agency (Supreme Tickets) {{and bought}} one seat from William Deutsch (proprietor of Supreme) for a comedy called Dancing Partner at the Belasco Theatre. He then went to Billy Haas's Chophouse at 332 West 45th Street, where he ate dinner with Ritzi and William Klein, a lawyer friend. Klein later told {{investigators}} that Crater was {{in a good mood}} that evening and gave no indication that anything <b>was</b> <b>bothering</b> him. The dinner ended a little after 9 p.m., shortly after the curtain rose on the show for which Crater had bought a ticket, and the small group went outside.|$|E
25|$|I {{wanted the}} whole country to know in detail what had {{happened}} at that factory, and to understand what had gone on there—the fruitless...lack of enforcement by the Department of Labor, the whole long lousy history of neglect, deceit and stupidity—was happening in dozens of other ways, in hundreds of other factories, to thousands of other men across the land. I wanted {{people to know that}} thousands upon thousands of their fellow citizens were being assaulted daily, and that the police—in this case, the federal government—had done nothing to remedy the situation. In short I wanted them to know that murder was being committed in the workplace, and that no one <b>was</b> <b>bothering</b> about it.|$|E

500|$|The film {{focuses on}} the effects Star Trek had {{on the lives of}} Shatner and Nimoy, with each actor {{interviewing}} the other about his fame. They talk about Star Treks origins and the death of DeForest Kelley, who had portrayed Leonard McCoy in both The Original Series and The Animated Series. Shatner and Nimoy also discuss interactions between themselves and others on the set of Star Trek, including conflicts. Both Shatner and Nimoy describe having had strained relationships with Gene Roddenberry, the creator of Star Trek, and attest to other members of the Original Series cast disliking Shatner. Only one of these cast members is referred to by name: Nichelle Nichols, who portrayed Nyota Uhura. [...] "I never fully comprehended what it was that <b>was</b> <b>bothering</b> them", says Shatner.|$|E
500|$|During the 1992 season, Ripken and the Orioles {{tried to}} work out a new contract. Several times {{throughout}} the season, Ripken endured batting slumps. He said after the season, [...] "I don't like to make excuses for the fact that I wasn't hitting, but I was distracted... I just felt like the Orioles were playing mind games with me. Whether that was right or wrong, it <b>was</b> <b>bothering</b> me." [...] On August 22, Ripken finally signed a five-year, $30.5 million contract, the largest in baseball history at the time. Ripken's slumps continued, and he was even booed by Orioles' fans late in the season. He finished the year batting [...]251 with career-lows in home runs (14) and RBI (72). The Orioles contended for the playoffs much of the year, not getting eliminated until September 27. However, he did win his second Gold Glove Award.|$|E
2500|$|Prescribing the Symptom and Amplifying a Deviation - Very typically, Erickson would {{instruct}} {{his patients}} to actively and consciously perform the symptom that <b>was</b> <b>bothering</b> them (see the nailbiting example under Resistance), usually with some minor or trivial {{deviation from the}} original symptom. In many cases, the deviation could be amplified and used as a [...] "wedge" [...] to transform the whole behaviour.|$|E

2500|$|Scientologists (especially Volunteer Ministers) {{are taught}} to {{administer}} the [...] "Touch Assist", a procedure designed by Hubbard to help heal illnesses or injuries. The Scientologist touches the person's body in a set manner, avoiding sexual areas, and asks {{the recipient of the}} process, who is lying or sitting still, to [...] "Feel my finger". This is continued until the recipient states that he feels better about what <b>was</b> <b>bothering</b> him and looks more cheerful overall. The process is claimed to help restore the spiritual being's (thetan in Scientology terminology) ability to communicate with the affected area and thereby to speed healing and reduce mental trauma.|$|E

30|$|Postoperatively, 5.5 % of our {{patients}} <b>were</b> still <b>bothered</b> by urgency, and 11 % <b>were</b> <b>bothered</b> by urge incontinence. Other studies have also reported similar improvements in urgency [14, 19 – 21]. In our study, only 7 % {{of the women who}} <b>were</b> <b>bothered</b> by stress and urge incontinence improved with medication treatment as a start while 83 % improved with surgical intervention. Nearly two thirds of the women who <b>were</b> still <b>bothered</b> by urge incontinence after the TVT operation had had a previous incontinence operation, were significantly older, and had a higher preoperative urge score.|$|R

60|$|Johnny Chuck slapped at his {{ear with}} a little black hand, for he thought a fly <b>was</b> <b>bothering</b> him, just as Peter Rabbit meant that he should. Peter tickled the other ear. Johnny Chuck {{shook his head and}} slapped at this with the other little black hand. Peter almost giggled. He sat still a few minutes, then tickled Johnny Chuck again. Johnny slapped three or four times at the {{imaginary}} fly. This time Peter clapped both hands over his mouth to keep from laughing.|$|E

60|$|Unc' Billy Possum {{was very}} sober as he {{hurried down the}} Lone Little Path to Johnny Chuck's house. He was very sober indeed, {{and that is very}} unusual for Unc' Billy Possum. It was very plain to see that {{something}} <b>was</b> <b>bothering</b> him. Johnny Chuck was sitting on his doorstep when Unc' Billy Possum came in sight, trotting down the Lone Little Path. As soon as Johnny saw him, he turned his back squarely towards Unc' Billy and pretended to be very much interested in something way off in the other direction. Unc' Billy came to a stop about two feet behind Johnny Chuck.|$|E
60|$|As for the clothes, they warn't any, any more. Every last rag of {{them was}} inside of the animals; and not agreeing with them very well, I don't reckon, for there was {{considerable}} many brass buttons on them, and there was knives in the pockets, too, and smoking tobacco, and nails and chalk and marbles and fishhooks and things. But I wasn't caring. All that <b>was</b> <b>bothering</b> me was, that all we had now was the professor's clothes, a big enough assortment, but not suitable to go into company with, if we came across any, because the britches was as long as tunnels, and the coats and things according. Still, there was everything a tailor needed, and Jim {{was a kind of}} jack legged tailor, and he allowed he could soon trim a suit or two down for us that would answer.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps {{the girl}} had a wisdom unusual in her sex. She {{knew that it was}} useless to argue with a man when his mind was made up, for it only {{increased}} his stubbornness, and she held her peace. And now on the shabby schooner, threading her way across the silent sea, among those lovely islands, was enacted a dark, tense drama of which the fat little captain remained entirely ignorant. The girl's resistance fired Bananas so that he ceased to be a man, but was simply blind desire. He did not make love to her gently or gaily, but with a black and savage ferocity. Her contempt now was changed to hatred and when he besought her she answered him with bitter, angry taunts. But the struggle went on silently, and when the captain asked her after a little while whether Bananas <b>was</b> <b>bothering</b> her, she lied.|$|E

60|$|I know a man, for example--his name is Spugg--whose {{private bank}} account was {{overdrawn}} last month twenty thousand dollars. He {{told me so}} at dinner at his club, with apologies for feeling out of sorts. He said it <b>was</b> <b>bothering</b> him. He said he thought it rather unfair of his bank to have called his attention to it. I could sympathise, {{in a sort of}} way, with his feelings. My own account was overdrawn twenty cents at the time. I knew that if the bank began calling in overdrafts it might be my turn next. Spugg said he supposed he'd have to telephone his secretary in the morning to sell some bonds and cover it. It seemed an awful thing to have to do. Poor people are never driven to this sort of thing. I have known cases of their having to sell a little furniture, perhaps, but imagine having to sell the very bonds out of one's desk. There's a bitterness about it that the poor man can never know.|$|E
6000|$|... "There was no jouking her," [...] said Corp. [...] "Do {{you mind}} how {{that used to}} bother you?" [...] a {{senseless}} remark to a man whom it <b>was</b> <b>bothering</b> still--or shall we say to a boy? For the boy came back to Tommy {{when he heard the}} Drumly singing; {{it was as if he}} had suddenly seen his mother looking young again. There had been a thunder-shower as they drew near, followed by a rush of wind that pinned them to a dike, swept the road bare, banged every door in the glen, and then sank suddenly as if it had never been, like a mole in the sand. But now the sun was out, every fence and farm-yard rope was a string of diamond drops. There was one to every blade of grass; they lurked among the wild roses; larks, drunken with song, shook them from their wings. The whole earth shone so gloriously with them that for a time Tommy ceased to care whether he was admired. We can pay nature no higher compliment.|$|E
6000|$|Because I {{felt very}} happy in going back to Pompeii after a generation, and being alive {{to do so in}} the body, I {{resolved}} to behave handsomely by the cabman who drove me from my hotel to the station. I said to myself that I would do something that would surprise him, and I gave him his fee and nearly a franc over; but it was I who was surprised, for he ran after me into the station, as I supposed, to extort more. He was holding out a franc toward me, and I asked the guide who <b>was</b> <b>bothering</b> me to take him to Pompeii (where there are swarms of guides always on the grounds) what the matter was. [...] "It is false," [...] he explained, and this proved true, though whether the franc was the one I had given the driver or whether it was one which he had thoughtfully substituted for it to make good an earlier loss I shall now never know. I put it into my pocket, wondering what I should do with it; the question what you shall do with counterfeit money in Italy is one which is apt to recur as I have hinted, and in despair of solving it at the moment I threw the false franc out of the car-window; it was the false franc I have already boasted of throwing away.|$|E
