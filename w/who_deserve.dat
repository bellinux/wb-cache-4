Those who survived were often left mutilated, suffering permanent disability, weakened bodies, and mental distress. On 19 August 1947, the doctors captured by Allied forces were put on trial in USA vs. Karl Brandt et al., commonly known as the Doctors' Trial. At the trial, several of the doctors argued in their defense that there was no international law regarding medical experimentation.|$|E

500|$|On two {{occasions}} Japanese citizens have sued their government for damages from the bombings, {{arguing that the}} government is culpable for having waged a [...] "reckless war" [...] that provoked the bombings and for requiring civilians to remain in the targeted areas. In December 2009 the Tokyo District Court dismissed one of the suits, stating that {{it was not possible to}} identify individuals <b>who</b> <b>deserve</b> compensation as almost all Japanese suffered as a result of the war. The court also ruled that any compensation should be allocated through the legislative, rather than judicial, process. In December 2011, the Osaka District Court handed down a similar ruling, adding that the government did not violate its constitution in its treatment of bombing victims. This judgement stated that there had not been [...] "unreasonable disparity" [...] in how civilians, soldiers, and atomic bomb survivors were treated, and that the government had showed [...] "no gross deviation from its discretionary right in not legislating for redress measures".|$|E

In Apatzingán, Moreno González preached to the poor and always carried a bible with him. With time, he won the loyalty of several locals, and many started to see him as a [...] "messiah" [...] for preaching {{religious}} principles and forming La Familia Michoacana, a drug cartel that posed as a vigilante group. When Carlos Rosales Mendoza was arrested in 2004, Moreno González ascended to the apex of La Familia Michoacana, a drug trafficking organization based in western Mexico, along with José de Jesús Méndez Vargas. In 2006, La Familia Michoacana broke relations with the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas, and Moreno González heralded the organization's independence when several of his gunmen tossed five human heads on a discothèque dance floor in Uruapan.

500|$|A {{writer for}} The Miami Herald was {{negative}} towards the release saying that [...] "Madonna's latest misstep is this pointless Remixed & Revisited seven-track EP {{in which she}} tries to resell five songs from her recent American Life CD to an audience <b>who</b> <b>deserve</b> far better efforts from the queen, than this." [...] Ricardo Baca from The Denver Post compared Madonna to actress Drew Barrymore {{on the cover of}} the EP, feeling that the singer looked foolish and that the tracks were weal attempts at [...] "spicing up" [...] the already non-commercial songs from American Life. Kevin C. Johnson from St. Louis Post-Dispatch said that with the remixes, Madonna [...] "put some life" [...] back into the songs of American Life, complementing [...] "Your Honesty" [...] and wondering why it was left from the Bedtime Stories sessions.

500|$|Dexters writing staff began {{meeting in}} March 2008 to {{brainstorm}} {{ideas for the}} third season's storylines. Writer Clyde Phillips said that, when the writers decided to open season 3 with the revelation of Rita's pregnancy, [...] "we were thinking about how it would affect Dexter psychologically and emotionally to create a life when he {{has spent most of}} his adult life taking lives." [...] They chose to introduce Miguel as a new character with the intention for his and Dexter's relationship to be [...] "the central arc of the season", according to Hall. Smits was the only actor who was considered for the role of Miguel. Smits was not initially interested in joining the cast, but after Phillips explained Miguel's dark side to him, Smits accepted the job offer because it was an opportunity to play a character dissimilar to any he had played before. He said, [...] "They promised upfront that this was really going to challenge me, that it would be stuff that I haven't done before, and they've really given me a shot. They've delivered the goods." [...] In regard to Dexter's abandonment of Harry's Code, Hall said that [...] "That need to rebel is a real engine for what unfolds this season." [...] Smits was hired to appear in ten of the season's twelve episodes. When asked at the beginning of the second season whether there was any possibility of Dexter killing an innocent person, show runner Daniel Cerone said that by not doing so, they were [...] "protecting the character". He thought that it was [...] "very important for the show that he does kill people <b>who</b> <b>deserve</b> it". Phillips said that [...] "We don't want him knowingly killing somebody who doesn't deserve it out of impulse or something, but we have explored the notion of his having killed someone without properly vetting that person and perhaps making a mistake." ...|$|E

2500|$|Anton LaVey, who {{has been}} {{referred}} to as [...] "The Father of Satanism", synthesized his religion through the establishment of the Church of Satan in 1966 and the publication of The Satanic Bible in 1969.

In LaVey's view, the Satanist is a carnal, physical and pragmatic being, where enjoyment of physical existence and an undiluted view of this-worldly truth are promoted as the core values of Satanism, propagating a naturalistic worldview that sees mankind as animals existing in an amoral universe.|$|E
