25|$|A small {{single-sided}} {{version of}} this boiler was also produced for launches. The first small {{version of this}} also dispensed with the wing drum, the water-wall tubes bending at right angles and passing back to the central <b>water</b> <b>drum,</b> the tubes also forming the grate to support the fire.|$|E
25|$|Yarrow's {{production}} boiler had {{a simple}} and distinctive design that remained broadly unchanged afterwards. Three drums were arranged in a triangular formation: a single large steam drum {{at the top and}} two smaller water drums below. They were linked by straight watertubes in a multi-row bank to each <b>water</b> <b>drum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Drums {{are highly}} {{influential}} in American Indian music. Different tribes have different traditions about their drums {{and how to}} play them. For larger dance or powwow type drums, the basic construction is very similar in most tribes: a wooden frame or a carved and hollowed-out log, with rawhide buckskin or elk skin stretched out across the opening by sinew thongs. Traditionally American Indian drums are large, two to three feet in diameter, and they are played communally by groups of singers who sit around them in a circle. For smaller single-sided hand drums, a thinner frame or shell is used, and a rawhide surface is strung onto only one side, with lacing across the other. Other types include two basic styles of water drums: the Iroquois type and the Yaqui type. The Iroquois <b>water</b> <b>drum</b> is a small cup-shaped wooden vessel, with water inside it, and a moistened tanned hide stretched across the top opening; the wetness and tightness of the tanned hide produce changes in pitch as the <b>water</b> <b>drum</b> is played over time. The Yaqui type of <b>water</b> <b>drum</b> is actually a half gourd, large in size, that floats in a tub of water like a bubble on the surface; the outer round surface of the gourd is struck with a drum stick, and the vibrations are amplified using the tub of water as a resonator.|$|E
25|$|<b>Water</b> <b>drums</b> {{are also}} {{sometimes}} {{treated as a}} distinct category of membranophone. Common in Native American music and the music of Africa, <b>water</b> <b>drums</b> are characterized by a unique sound caused by filling the drum with some amount of water.|$|R

25|$|The {{assumption}} was that flow through the water-tubes would be upwards, owing to their heating by the furnace, and that the counterbalancing downward flow would require external unheated downcomers. In most water-tube designs these were a few large-diameter external pipes from the steam drum to the <b>water</b> <b>drum.</b> These large-diameter pipes were thus a problem for reliability owing to their rigidity and the forces upon them.|$|E
25|$|A {{secondary}} {{effect of the}} superheater was to increase the temperature differential between inner and outer tubes of the bank, thus encouraging circulation. The two water drums were often linked by unheated downcomers, to allow this flow between the drums. This effect was later encouraged in the Admiralty boiler, where the tubes of a bank were curved apart to leave space for a superheater, whilst retaining the single <b>water</b> <b>drum.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Mumford boiler was {{a variety}} {{built by the}} {{boilermakers}} Mumford of Colchester, intended for use in smaller boats. The tube banks separated into two groups, with the short tubes slightly curved away from each other. Entry into the lower <b>water</b> <b>drum</b> was perpendicular, requiring an almost rectangular drum with the tubes entering on separate faces. The mechanical weakness of such a shape was acceptable in this small size, but limited the boiler's potential. The casing was small and only enclosed part of the upper steam drum, leading directly to a funnel. A single inverted tee-shaped downcomer linked the drums {{at the rear of}} the boiler.|$|E

25|$|The Thornycroft boiler is {{a variant}} that splits the usual central furnace into two. There are four drums: two main drums {{vertically}} in the centre – a steam and a <b>water</b> <b>drum</b> – also two wing drums {{at the outside}} edges of the furnace. The design was notable for its early use of the water-wall furnace. The outer bank of tubes was shallow, consisting of only two rows of tubes. These rows were spaced closely, so that the tubes formed a solid wall, without gasflow between them. The inner bank of tubes was similar: the two rows of tubes closest to the furnace formed a similar water wall. These tubes were splayed apart at their base, so as to provide space for gasflow between them. Within the tube bank, gas flow is mostly parallel to the tubes, similar to some early designs, but contrary to the crossflow design of later three-drum boilers. The exhaust gas emerged into the heart-shaped space below the upper central drum, exiting to the funnel through the rear wall.|$|E
25|$|Ten {{locomotives}} (numbers 92020-92029) {{were built}} in 1955 with the Franco-Crosti boiler. which incorporated a combustion gas feed water preheater that recuperated low-grade residual heat In the 9F version, this {{took the form of}} a single cylindrical <b>water</b> <b>drum</b> running along the underside of the main boiler barrel. The standard chimney on top of the smokebox was only used during lighting up. In normal working the gases went through firetubes inside the preheater drum that led to a second smokebox situated beneath the boiler from which there emerged a chimney on the right-hand side, just forward of the firebox. In the event, the experiment did not deliver the hoped-for benefits, and efficiency was not increased sufficiently to justify the cost and complexity. Moreover, conditions were unpleasant on the footplate in a cross-wind, this in spite of the later provision of a small deflector plate forward of the chimney. These problems led to the subsequent removal of the preheater drum, although the locomotives did retain the original main smokebox with its distinctive look.|$|E
25|$|The Woolnough {{design was}} used by Sentinel for their larger railway locomotives. It resembled most other three-drum designs, having almost-straight tubes. Its {{distinguishing}} feature was a firebrick wall {{two-thirds of the way}} down the furnace. The furnace grate was on the longer side of this, with the combustion gases passing out through the tube bank, along inside a steel outer casing, then back within the shorter tube bank. Coiled tube superheaters were placed in the gas flow outside the tubes. The combustion gases thus passed through the tube bank twice, once outwards and then again inwards. A single central chimney exhausted from the centre of the far end, not as usual from outside the tubes. The relative temperature difference between gas passage through the two sections of the bank led to a circulation current that was upwards through the first, hotter, part of the bank and downwards through the further, less hot, bank. Circulation was also controlled by an internal weir plate within the upper <b>water</b> <b>drum,</b> so as to keep a depth of water above the ends of the hotter tubes, thus avoiding overheating of dry tubes.|$|E

This is an O-type boiler with a single lower <b>water</b> <b>drum</b> and curved tubes, rather than the triangular arrangement with two drums used by the Admiralty. The first boiler design suffered from poor circulation and so external cold downcomers were added, making the reworked boiler 10% heavier. The boiler was well-regarded in service as it reduced the amount of potentially troublesome refractory firebrick usually used for {{the base of the}} furnace.|$|E
2500|$|From 1929, Hawthorn Leslie {{constructed}} a trial boiler with a partial water-wall {{to the rear}} of the furnace. Unlike other water-wall designs, this additional <b>water</b> <b>drum</b> spanned only the centre of the furnace, the vertical tubes were enclosed in a refractory casing and did not form a closely packed solid wall. The concern was that a full water-wall would unbalance the existing header arrangement of the three-drum boiler, which indeed showed to be the case. Excess steam production at the rear of the steam drum led to disrupted circulation and a problem with priming. The development of water-walls for this type of boiler was abandoned, although trials did continue with [...] which was trialled with a single water-wall Johnson boiler replacing one of its three three-drum boilers.|$|E
50|$|The D-type boiler has a <b>water</b> <b>drum,</b> steam drum, and {{generating}} tubes. Water {{flows into}} the steam drum, flows down the downcomers and into the <b>water</b> <b>drum.</b> Water is then sent from the <b>water</b> <b>drum</b> through the generating tubes, where the fire is located around causing water molecules to boil off into steam. Steam rises up more generating tubes and finally back into the steam drum where the dry pipe is located then into the plant. This configuration shaped the package boiler into a D-shape, hence the name D-type package boiler. These boilers are mostly used for plants that allow greater clearances.|$|E

2500|$|The boiler resembled two {{elongated}} marine Yarrow boilers, placed end to end. Both had {{the usual}} Yarrow arrangement {{of a central}} large steam drum above two separated <b>water</b> <b>drums,</b> linked by four rows of slightly curved tubes. The upper drum was shared, but the lower <b>water</b> <b>drums</b> were separate. The rearward [...] "firebox" [...] area was wide and spanned the frames, placing the <b>water</b> <b>drums</b> at {{the limits of the}} loading gauge. The forward [...] "boiler" [...] region was narrow-set, with its <b>water</b> <b>drums</b> placed between the frames. Although the outer casings were of similar width, the tube banks for the forward section were much closer. The space outboard of the tubes formed a pair of exhaust flues leading forwards. A large space outside these flue walls but inside the boiler casing was used as an air duct from the air inlet, a crude rectangular slot beneath the smokebox door, which had the effect of both pre-heating the combustion air and of cooling the outer casing to prevent overheating. Longitudinal superheater tubes were placed in the central space between the steam generating tubes. The third area forwards contained superheater headers, the regulators and the smokebox, but no deliberate heating surface. The external boiler casing remained at much the same width throughout, giving an overall triangular, but curved, appearance. The lower edge of each section stepped upwards, and was obvious externally.|$|R
