Leaving you country, in spite of its enormous magnitude, you are robbers that broke into our territory, plundering and killing us mercilessly. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> thought of doing such things to you, but you have invaded our land, astonishing us with this murderous diabolical countenance, making us stubbornly resist, not for us to lose our independence and autonomy, trying to keep our golden will and freedom in our hands.

You point Aslanduz to me out, where your „two-thousand large detachment“ supposedly defeated our „thirty-thousand large army“. Shame on you, General, to lie, you should speak the truth, without hiding the real facts of how it ended there, and you shouldn't brag about that particular victory of you over us, which was thanks to the despicable betrayal of our troops. If you forgot about this outrageous event, I shall remind you, fueling anger and hostility towards Abbas Mirza for his strict handling his soldiers wanted to take revenge on him, by raising the white flag amongst 10,500 soldiers, and voluntarily gave themselves up, laid down their weapons and hoped to receive salvation from you; but instead, you disarmed them, without conscience and compassion, and watched how your soldiers killed then thousand of them, leaving alive only 500 people as a trophy of victory. Shame and disgrace. It is a worthy lesson as traitors are oath breakers, {{but at the same time}} a good warning for the rest of the treacherous soldiers, lest they be deceived and deceived by your cunning and false promises. And after these vile barbaric executions committed by you on innocent people who voluntarily handed down themselves to you, you dare to speak of love for man. I feel sorry for your brave soldiers serving as blind tools to achieve your robbers goals: but your boss will only reward you as the commander, with decorations, medals and even large sums of money for the heroic and courageous deed of your brave soldiers, whom it will bypass.|$|E

500|$|From {{his early}} days, Auerbach was {{convinced}} that the fast break, where a team used a quick outlet pass to fast guards who run downcourt and score before the opponent had re-established position, was a potent tactical weapon. This new strategy proved lethal for the opposition. Further, Auerbach moved emphasis away from individual accolades and instilled the teamwork element into his players. He also invented the concept of the role player and of the sixth man, stating: [...] "Individual honors are nice, but no Celtic has ever gone {{out of his way to}} achieve them. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> had the league's top scorer. In fact, we won seven league championships without placing even one among the league's top 10 scorers. Our pride was never rooted in statistics." ...|$|E

However, he was insistent that combat photographs were never faked – [...] "we have strict instructions not to do – <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> done it". He had a fondness for a dramatic use of silhouette, with images composed to show soldiers walking along a ridge against the light. These images, where individual men were not easily recognisable, often were used to illustrate the [...] "anonymous heroes" [...] of the war.|$|E

Instead there are many separate heart ailments, or combinations of them. It is something like that with alcoholism. We did not wish to get in wrong with the medical profession by pronouncing alcoholism a disease entity. We always called it an illness, or a malady—a far safer term for us to use. In professional and research contexts, the term [...] "alcoholism" [...] sometimes encompasses both alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence, and sometimes is considered equivalent to alcohol dependence. Talbot (1989) observes that alcoholism in the classical disease model follows a progressive course: if a person continues to drink, their condition will worsen. This will lead to harmful consequences in their life, physically, mentally, emotionally and socially.|$|E

500|$|In December 1987, as news {{began to}} {{circulate}} about the commissioned work, local Assyrians accused Parhad of misrepresenting Ashurbanipal.

The critics thought the statue made a better portrayal of the Sumerian king Gilgamesh. One critic said: It's very simple. The statue represents Gilgamesh.... No Assyrian has a right to imagine things about our king. It's exactly like making a copy of the Statue of Liberty and saying it is George Washington.... Assyrian kings didn't wear miniskirts. They wouldn't have been holding a lion or a book. It's an insult to the Assyrians. Narsai David responded: They are entitled to their opinion.... <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> said this is a museum-quality reproduction....

He says I am going on all right, but of course I feel rather a wreck". She died the following day of a heart attack. John Unterecker believes Olivia's death shattered Yeats, who died only months later, because she added warmth to his life. Yeats wrote of her death:Olivia Shakespear has died suddenly. For more than forty years she has been the centre of my life in London and during all that time <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> had a quarrel, sadness sometimes but never a difference.

She was not more lovely than distinguished—no matter what happened she never lost her solitude... For the moment I cannot bear the thought of London. I will find her memory everywhere.|$|E
500|$|Hu's {{most notable}} {{work is the}} Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting and Calligraphy (Shizhuzhai Shuhuapu, [...] ), an {{anthology}} of around 320 prints by around thirty different artists (including Hu himself), published in 1633. It consists of eight sections, covering calligraphy, bamboo, flowers, rocks, birds and animals, plums, orchids and fruit. Some of these sections had been released previously as single volumes. As well {{as a collection of}} artworks, it was also intended as an artistic primer, with instructions on correct brush position and technique and several pictures designed for beginners to copy. Although these instructions only appear in the sections on orchids and bamboo, the book still remains the first example of a categorical and analytical approach to Chinese painting. In this book, Hu used his multiple-block printing methods to obtain gradations of colour in the images, rather than obvious outlines or overlaps. The manual is bound in the [...] "butterfly binding" [...] (hudie zhuang, [...] ) style, whereby whole-folio illustrations are folded so that each occupies a double-page spread. This binding style allows the reader to lay the book flat in order to look at a particular image. Cambridge University Library released a complete digital scan of the manual, including all writings and illustrations in August, 2015. Said Charles Aylmer, Head of the Cambridge University Chinese Department, [...] "The binding is so fragile, and the manual so delicate, that until it was digitized, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> been able to let anyone look through it or study it – despite its undoubted importance to scholars." ...|$|E
500|$|Development of {{the game}} begun {{after the release of}} Nights into Dreams... in July 1996, after Sonic Team {{received}} a lot of letters from fans asking [...] "who Sonic was". Naka and Naoto Ohshima thought it was important to introduce people to the Sonic character, which was the basis for introducing [...] "Project Sonic" [...] to the public. Until the release of Sonic Jam, the studio themselves had not worked on a Sonic title since Sonic & Knuckles in 1994, in which Naka thought that Sonic Team had a good rest period to [...] "recharge our batteries" [...] and had new ideas regarding a new game. [...] "Sonic World"—Sonic Jams 3D hub world—served as a prototype for the first fully 3D Sonic game—Sonic Adventure—which began development for the Saturn but was moved to its successor, the Dreamcast. In a retrospective interview, Naka stated that the 3D section of Sonic Jam was part of an experiment to see how a Sonic the Hedgehog game would work in full 3D. [...] "Sonic World" [...] uses the same engine as Nights; there is speculation that Naka's refusal to share the Nights engine with the Sega Technical Institute (STI) team developing Sonic X-treme—a factor in the latter's cancellation—was motivated by his preference for Sonic Team's own efforts to create an original 3D Sonic title. Naka later expressed [...] "relief" [...] that X-treme was cancelled. Naka and Ohshima reflected that the most difficult part during the development process was gathering game-specific information in [...] "Sonic World", as [...] "there are so many games <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> even heard of... Sega's a big company and before we knew it lots of different game systems had sprung up (including Game Gear, Master System and Pico)." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{heard by}} the Belgian {{commission}} on cults, philosopher Luc Nefontaine said that [...] "the establishment of a directory of cult movements (...) seems to him dangerous, because it would also give a bad image of quite honourable organizations such as (...) Antoinism". Eric Brasseur, director of Centre for information and advice on harmful cultish organizations (Centre d'information et d'avis sur les organisations sectaires nuisibles, or CIAOSN) said: [...] "This is a Belgian worship for which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>never</b> had a complaint in 12 years, a rare case to report". Similarly, in 2013, the Interministerial Mission for Monitoring and Combatting Cultic Deviances (Mission interministérielle de vigilance et de lutte contre les dérives sectaires, or MIVILUDES) made this comment: [...] "We have never received reporting from Antoinists. They heal through prayer, {{but as long as}} they do not prevent people from getting proper treatment by legal means..." [...] In addition, the Renseignements généraux stopped monitoring the religion given the absence of any problem. In 2002, the national service [...] "Pastoral, sects and new beliefs" [...] ("Pastorale, sectes et nouvelles croyances"), which analyses new religious movements from a catholic point of view, wrote about Antoinism: [...] "Although listed among the cults in the 1995 Parliamentary Report, it has no cultish feature." [...] Similarly, Dericquebourg, who deeply studied the religious group, concluded that Antoinism is not a cult: it [...] "has no totalitarian influence on its members, and do not dictate their behaviour to get in the world; it is not exclusive [...] shows no hostility towards social systems". According to Bégot, the group is a [...] "cult" [...] in the sociological language (not to be confused with the pejorative word [...] "cult"), characterized by a mystical experience, a break with the dominant religious tradition, and primacy of the individual on social issues; it has both magical and ethical dimensions.|$|E
