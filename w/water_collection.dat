The present work experimentally and theoretically investigates <b>water</b> condensation and <b>collection</b> on flat surfaces with contrasting contact angles and contact angle hysteresis (CAH) to elucidate their roles on <b>water</b> mass <b>collection</b> efficiency. The experimental results indicate that a hydrophilic surface promotes nucleation and individual droplets growth, and a surface with a low CAH tends to let a smaller droplet to slide down, but the overall <b>water</b> mass <b>collection</b> efficiency is independent of both surface contact angle and CAH. The experimental results agree well with our theoretical calculations. During water condensation, a balance has to be struck between single droplet growth and droplet density on a surface so as to maintain a constant water droplet surface coverage ratio, which renders the role of both surface wettability and hysteresis insignificant to the ultimate <b>water</b> mass <b>collection.</b> Moreover, <b>water</b> droplets {{on the edges of}} a surface grow much faster than those on the non-edge areas and thus dominate the contribution to the <b>water</b> mass <b>collection</b> by the entire surface, directly pointing out the very important role of edge effect on <b>water</b> condensation and <b>collection...</b>|$|R

METHODS: The specimens were collected in different <b>water</b> <b>collections</b> of 36 municipalities along the Estrada Real in the southeast of the State of Minas Gerais. Biomphalaria species were characterized using both morphological and molecular approaches. The research was conducted between August 2005 and September 2009 and all the sites visited were georeferenced using GPS. RESULTS: Six Biomphalaria species were found in 30 of the 36 municipalities studied: glabrata, tenagophila, straminea, peregrina, occidentalis and schrammi. The first three species of Biomphalaria, recognized as intermediate hosts of S. mansoni, were present in 33. 3 %, 47. 2 % and 8. 3 % of the municipalities studied, respectively.

A computerized building temperature regulation system, motion light sensors for indoor and outdoor lighting and open loop ground-source heat pumps further reduce energy consumption on campus. The campus has also converted nearly 20 percent of its lawn space to native plants and prairie restoration.

25|$|Foraging wasps gather nectar and prey for {{nourishment}} and water, resin, {{and wood}} pulp for the nest. Nectar {{is a crucial}} resource for any colony since it is used for feeding both immatures and adults. Foragers also acquire nectar at lower energy costs compared to that needed to capture prey. It {{seems to be more}} advantageous for P. exigua to take the prey in the crop, since their flight becomes less difficult. The number of prey captured by foraging wasps tends to increase as the colony grows. In addition, P. exigua have been reported performing trophallaxis with adults and between adults and larvae. Foraging for animal proteins is the most complex task for worker wasps. In order to successfully hunt prey, wasps require prey recognition, predation ability and the capacity to return to the nest. Foragers must make recognition flights to get an image of the surrounding landmarks that compose its environment at different distances. These flights ultimately enable wasps to use visual markers to direct them back to their colony. It is extremely important that workers carry water to the nest; <b>water</b> <b>collection</b> occurs more often in the warmer periods of the day. Water is a crucial source for nest building, and in its absence, this activity would not happen efficiently.
