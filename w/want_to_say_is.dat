500|$|In 1910, Vanderbilt's only blemish was {{fighting}} defending national champion Yale to a scoreless tie. Team captain Bill Neely, recalling the tie with Yale said: [...] "The score {{tells the story}} a good deal better than I can. All I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is</b> that I never saw a football team fight any harder at every point than Vanderbilt fought today – line, ends, and backfield. We went in to give Yale the best we had and I think we about did it." [...] The team was led by third-team Walter Camp All-American guard Will Metzger, and piloted by Morrison.|$|E
2500|$|Nick Bond of News.com.au {{described}} Dicko's {{criticism of}} Paulini's gold dress as [...] "one {{of the most}} controversial moments in Australian Idol history," [...] while Andrew Bucklow from the same publication labelled it one of the show's [...] "most infamous moments" [...] ever. During Dicko's appearance on The Celebrity Apprentice Australia in 2012, he revealed that [...] "people were virtually spitting on me" [...] after that Australian Idol episode had aired, calling it a defining moment for him because he [...] "became a national pariah" [...] overnight. In an episode of The Celebrity Apprentice and in reference to the gold dress controversy, Dicko made a statue of someone wearing a gold dress with the word [...] "sorry" [...] printed on it. Paulini appeared in the episode to see what Dicko had made and she accepted his apology. In 2014, Dicko told Woman's Day that he does not regret what he said to Paulini, saying [...] "It’s part of who I am and who Paulini is and it binds us together." [...] In July 2017, Dicko apologised again in a pre-recorded message he left for Paulini during her radio interview on Hot 91.1 FM's breakfast show, Dave, Sam & Ash. In the message, Dicko said [...] "I was trying to be nice at the time, can you believe, but I'm glad that you've gone on to do such great things." [...] After joking that his [...] "cruel little words" [...] turned them [...] "into Australian reality TV's power couple", he ended his message by telling Paulini, [...] "what I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>is,</b> I'm so proud of you girl, you go get'em." ...|$|E
