25|$|Chuck's {{philosophy}} was to convince every {{guy on the}} team that his role was important. If you came in {{as a free agent}} and were just a gunner on the punt team or the third safety, you <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> the team needed to win...It was his way of emphasizing that no one is irreplaceable. You have to coach everybody the same way. If Joe Greene goes out, Steve Furness goes in and we're not going to change anything. Chuck never panicked when someone got hurt or held out. We can still function. That made a big impression on me.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} period of {{exploration}} and development of ideas, premature conference presentations and individual seminars were given by {{various members of the}} Cambridge group in other archaeological departments in England and abroad. Individual scholars who were invited to talk to us in Cambridge in that period often felt, understandably, obliged to maintain a distinct opposition. While it is certainly the case that these presentations had occurred before our views had even begun to settle down, and that they were excessively aggressive, they {{played an important role in}} the process of enquiry and reformulation. In particular, the contrasts which were set up by us and by outside scholars allowed the views of the seminar group, and the differences of viewpoint within the group, to be clarified. The opposition highlighted our own opinion but also threw the spotlight on the blind alleys down which there was a danger of straying. Our aggression resulted from the conviction that we <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> new. This, too, was important. In the initial period there was a clear idea of what was wrong with existing approaches and there was a faith that something else could be done.|$|E

[...] Similarly, Jessica Winter of The Village Voice criticized the film for [...] "playing as a standard summer action film", despite being released in early November.

500|$|Several {{film and}} {{entertainment}} critics have noted similarities and {{parallels between the}} stories of The Lion King and William Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet, and their protagonists. [...] Allers said that these similarities were not initially intentional and {{came as a surprise}} to the filmmakers themselves; they noticed the similarities only after the story was established and they eventually decided to pursue it. [...] According to Hahn, [...] "When we first pitched the revised outline of the movie ... someone in the room announced that its themes and relationships were similar to Hamlet. [...] Everyone responded favorably to the idea that we <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> Shakespearean, so we continued {{to look for ways to}} model our film on that all-time classic." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Bangla Desh" [...] {{marked the}} first {{occasion}} that Harrison worked with Horn, who {{would go on to}} become a regular collaborator. Already a veteran of the LA music scene by 1971, Horn recalls his [...] "jaded" [...] mindset before meeting Harrison, but describes the session as a [...] "real turning point" [...] in his career, [...] "because we <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> for a cause". It was also the first time that Keltner played on a George Harrison session, the two musicians having already worked together on Lennon's Imagine album (1971). The [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] session {{was the beginning of a}} lifelong friendship, with the pair remaining [...] "as brothers", Keltner has said, until Harrison's death in 2001. Together with Clapton, Preston, Bob Dylan and the group Badfinger, all these musicians joined Harrison and Shankar on stage at Madison Square Garden.|$|E
500|$|Writer and supervising {{producer}} Brad Kern {{reflected on}} the show's cancellation, saying, [...] "Ten years later, everybody you talk to... they all love the show. I {{think that was the}} biggest disappointment about the show not coming back. We knew we <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> special." [...] Told of the show's success in the TV Guide [...] "Save Our Shows" [...] poll, Sandy Grushow said, [...] "Obviously I'm happy and not entirely surprised", but added, [...] "You can't dismiss a season's worth of ratings." [...] Kim Manners, director on {{nearly a third of the}} Brisco episodes, said working on the series gave him an opportunity to grow creatively. He told writer Joe Nazzaro, [...] "It really woke me up as a director, almost spiritually", and that directing for Brisco was a large contributing factor to his success as a regular director on The X-Files. Manners said, [...] "When they didn't give it a second year, I was devastated", adding that he wished Cuse would have made a feature film based on Brisco. Considering the show's short life, Cuse later commented, [...] "If the show could have survived into a second season, I think it could have ended up running for actually a long time. Some shows just sort of fall through the cracks in the right away and they kind of stay on the air long enough to aggregate an audience. I think if circumstances had been different, Brisco could have had a much longer life." [...] Cuse also said the Friday night time slot hurt Briscos chances of building an audience, saying, [...] "We were on at 8 p.m. on Friday night, which is sort of a death slot– I mean people do still go bowling– few shows have succeeded in that slot." ...|$|E

2500|$|Others {{compared}} {{the quality of}} the Bogdanov papers with that seen over a wider arena. [...] "The Bogdanoffs' work is significantly more incoherent than just about anything else being published", wrote Peter Woit. He continued, [...] "But the increasingly low standard of coherence in the whole field is what allowed them to think they <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> sensible and to get it published." [...] Woit later devoted a chapter of his book Not Even Wrong (2006) to the Bogdanov Affair.|$|E
2500|$|The {{authors have}} Ph.D. degrees [...] from the University of Burgundy; Grichka Bogdanov {{received}} his degree in mathematics, and Igor Bogdanov received his in theoretical physics (in 1999 and 2002 respectively). Both {{were given the}} low, unusual, but passing grade of [...] "honorable"; Igor initially failed and was required to publish three papers in peer-reviewed journals before being given a degree. When later challenges to {{the legitimacy of the}} papers submitted by the Bogdanov brothers arose, the debate spread {{to the question of whether}} the substitution of a [...] "publication requirement" [...] by university professors when they do not understand students' work is a valid means of determining the veracity of a paper. The validity of their work was supported after independent reviews by several physicists such as Jac Verbaarschot of Stony Brook, Roman Jackiw of MIT, and Robert Coquereaux. Columbia University mathematician Peter Woit has said, [...] "The Bogdanoffs' work is significantly more incoherent than just about anything else being published. But the increasingly low standard of coherence in the whole field is what allowed them to think they <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> sensible and publish it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harrison's first {{assignment}} {{under her}} new Fox contract {{was as a}} [...] "Biker Chick" [...] in Men Against Evil, a TV pilot which became the TV series Felony Squad. [...] "I had three words, [...] "Go, man, go!" [...] I was all of 20, and dressed in this really racy motorcycle outfit. Those were my first words! This was still the era of stardom and premieres. When you were put under a studio contract, every minute of your life was so exciting, because you <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> so unique and special." [...] (Three years later, Harrison co-starred as Felony Squad star Dennis Cole's love interest in the NBC TV series Bracken's World.) Harrison's next assignment was in the campy Batman TV series; she appeared briefly as one of three high school cheerleaders in the Batman episodes [...] "The Joker Goes to School" [...] and [...] "He Meets His Match, The Grisly Ghoul", which aired in early March 1966. To prepare Harrison for her few seconds onscreen, her Fox dance coach worked Harrison and her fellow cheerleaders {{early in the morning}} and on through the day. Linda, a former high school cheerleader, complained, [...] "You're going to use up all my energy, so when the shot comes, I won't have any." [...] Her coach complained that [...] "Linda Harrison gave me a hard time." [...] After the brief late afternoon shot, Harrison's overworked leg muscles failed on her way home, and Richard D. Zanuck had to carry her upstairs to their Wilshire-Westwood apartment.|$|E
