5|$|After {{his release}} from Bradford, Brandon spent {{a period of time}} {{training}} with Scottish-side Dundee United, although that <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> visiting his friend and former teammate Danny Cadamarteri and would not be offered a contract, before he was offered a trial with Port Vale in July 2010. It proved to be an unsuccessful trial, with Brandon spending time away from the game. He later held talks with Conference North side Guiseley, a non-league team from near Bradford. At the start of 2011, he signed for Thai Premier League side BEC Tero Sasana.|$|E
5|$|While Miller was a {{reluctant}} bowler, Bradman used him heavily {{because of his}} desire to have every possible spin option. Miller thus played as a middle-order batsman batting at No. 5 ahead of the wicket-keeper and the other bowlers, and an opening fast bowler, partnering Lindwall. For Victoria, Miller often batted higher at No. 3 or No. 4 and bowled less. For his state, Miller averaged more with the bat, which he felt <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able to concentrate more on his batting, as Hassett gave him a smaller workload with the ball.|$|E
25|$|The {{chairman}} of the Commission of Inquiry was Patrick Devlin, born in 1905 and made a High Court judge in 1948. He was promoted to the Court of Appeal in 1960, and in 1961 was made a Law Lord. He retired in 1964, {{at the age of}} only 58, but later denied this <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> disappointed at not being offered the more senior posts of Lord Chief Justice or Master of the Rolls. Its other three members included a former colonial governor, the head of an Oxford College and a Scottish Lord Provost.|$|E
60|$|It {{may have}} <b>been</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> just then {{cut off from}} all his fellow-creatures and even from the world itself; it may have <b>been</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> satiated with marvels and with the almost {{absolute}} control over the powers which the Demon had conferred upon him; or it may have <b>been</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born and reared a hearty, healthy American boy, with a disposition to battle openly with the world and take his chances equally with his fellows, rather than be placed in such an exclusive position {{that no one could}} hope successfully to oppose him.|$|R

25|$|Wert wrote a {{considerable}} amount of sacred music, but little of it was published during his lifetime. He published only three books of motets, one in 1566 and the other two in 1581; a few of his works, such as the Missa Dominicalis appeared in anthologies with the music of other composers. His other six masses remained in manuscript, as did the majority of the music he wrote for Santa Barbara in Mantua. Most likely this <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> commissioned to write that music, such as his cycle of 127 hymns, specifically for that institution, and his publisher was in Venice.|$|E
25|$|On December 16, 2006, the Park Police {{pulled over}} Barry for driving too slowly, which Barry later said <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{trying to figure}} out where to enter an {{elementary}} school's parking lot for a nonprofit foundation's event. After looking up Barry's record, the police officer told Barry that his license had been suspended and ticketed Barry for operating a vehicle on a suspended license, despite Barry's insistence to the contrary. Two days later, the D.C. Department of Motor Vehicles confirmed that Barry's license had not actually been suspended and said a computer glitch must have caused the error.|$|E
25|$|While in Dublin {{studying}} for the law, O'Connell was under his Uncle Maurice's instructions {{not to become}} involved in any militia activity. When Wolfe Tone's French invasion fleet entered Bantry Bay in December 1796, O'Connell found himself in a quandary. Politics was the cause of his unsettlement. Dennis Gwynn in his Daniel O'Connell: The Irish Liberator suggests that the unsettlement <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> enrolled as a volunteer in defence of Government, yet the Government was intensifying its persecution of the Catholic people—of which he was one. He desired to enter Parliament, yet every allowance that the Catholics had been led to anticipate, two years previously, was now flatly vetoed.|$|E

25|$|Though Hilfenhaus {{was bought}} by Chennai Super Kings for a price of $100,000, he did not play in the 2011 Indian Premier League (IPL) held in April due to injury. He {{recovered}} in time {{to be included in}} the AustraliaA squad to tour Zimbabwe in June. The intention was to give him the opportunity to find some form before the full Australia team toured Sri Lanka and South Africa later that year. The squad also contained Mitchell Starc, James Faulkner, and Trent Copeland, and it was hoped that Hilfenhaus' experience would benefit the younger fast bowlers, particularly as Starc and Faulkner had the ability to swing the ball. When the squad to tour Sri Lanka was announced in July, Hilfenhaus was omitted, according to selector Greg Chappell this <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not fit enough.|$|E
25|$|The entire French {{left wing}} had to squeeze through the blockage. The Russians took no {{prisoner}}s, killing every Frenchman that they caught. If a French soldier survived as a prisoner, it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> taken by Kray's Austrians. In the melee Grouchy tried to rally his men but was cut down and captured. Pérignon was also taken prisoner after suffering three wounds including a deep saber cut above his left eye. Colli {{and at least}} 2,000 other French soldiers and 21 artillery pieces were captured, mostly in the bottleneck at Pasturana. As night fell, the French army streamed away and the exhausted Allies stopped. Near midnight, some of Gardanne's men were discovered hiding out in Novi and the Russians went through the town again. Having accomplished their purpose, they began looting and Suvorov ordered his drummers to beat assembly to stop the pillage.|$|E
25|$|Gandalf {{tells the}} party that Sauron will now turn his eye to Minas Tirith. Gandalf rides on ahead, and sends the party to the ruined city of Osgiliath, to stand {{alongside}} Boromir's brother, Faramir. As they await {{the arrival of the}} army, Berethor muses that Osgiliath seems familiar to him. Éoaden remembers a Gondorian warrior who fought under Boromir during the defense of the city some time ago, but who fled the battle in fear. The party realize that Berethor is that man. He vows he will never flee again, and the party join Faramir in a fight against Gothmog. They defeat him, but he flees before they can kill him. Gandalf then summons the party back to Minas Tirith. Before they leave, however, Berethor learns the reason he fled Osgiliath <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> stabbed by a Morgul blade, the tip of which is still within him. He and Idrial face the Witch-king, but Idrial explains he cannot harm the Witch-king whilst the blade is still inside him. He cuts it out and they attack the Witch-king, driving him off. The party then head to Minas Tirith.|$|E

25|$|In 1577, some of {{the gang}} members were caught, {{including}} Niers himself. Monika Spicker-Beck, for example, notes that a Claus Strikker confessed in April that 10 years earlier, he had worked together with Niers, and helped him murder a 20-year-old woman in Gottswald. Also, an accomplice named Peter Oblath drew {{up a list of}} 14 gang members, including the name of Peter Niers. Joy Wiltenburg notes that Niers himself was arrested and tortured in Gersbach. There, he confessed to 75 acts of murder, but somehow managed to escape. Over the next few years, until his final arrest in 1581, a number of pamphlets, ballads, and stories were written and circulated detailing his cannibalism and mastery of the black arts. For example, it was said that when Niers and Sumer's gang gathered at Pfalzburg, they had a meeting with the Devil, who gave his blessing to the gang's ambitions, even providing Niers and Sumer with monthly pay along with granting supernatural powers to Niers. Even earlier than this, however, it seems that Niers learned how to become invisible from his mentor Martin Stier, and that the only reason he was finally caught <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> deprived of his bag containing the magical materials to make himself invisible. A critical component of such magical material was thought to be the remains of fetuses; during the casting of the spell the fetus hearts were eaten. Joy Wiltenburg mentions also another use of fetal black magic: To concoct the flesh and fats of infants into magic candles that, when lit, would allow them to rob houses without awaking the inhabitants.|$|E
500|$|Shankly's {{public persona}} {{was that of}} a [...] "tough guy" [...] with the swagger of his {{favourite}} film star James Cagney but privately he was very different. Joe Mercer described his [...] "heart of gold" [...] and likened him to a Border Collie who drives his sheep but could never hurt them. Liverpool's perceived failings in the late 1960s have been attributed to Shankly's reluctance to drop his long-serving players even though they were past their best. Bob Paisley said it was Shankly's [...] "one failing" [...] and it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> [...] "a softie at heart".|$|E

He {{would later}} reprise his {{role for the}} fifth season episodes [...] "Five More Short Graybles", [...] "Another Five More Short Graybles", and the sixth season episode [...] "Graybles 1000+". Every one of Philips's voice {{recording}} takes was so different that Nate Cash, one of the series' creative directors, had to piece together disparate recordings to make the final composition. The episode also contains the short song [...] "These Lumps", sung by Lumpy Space Princess. Ward himself {{had a difficult time}} singing this song <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> trying to both sing the song on pitch and retain Lumpy Space Princess's accent.|$|E

In a come-from-behind fight, Hughes {{was caught in a}} {{triangle}} choke by then-champion Carlos Newton, but he lifted Newton in the air and slammed him to the mat, causing Newton to hit his head and lose consciousness just as Hughes was himself on the verge of blacking out from the choke. After the match Carlos stated that he felt the reason Hughes fell to the mat <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> rendered unconscious from the triangle choke. This was confirmed by Hughes himself upon reviewing the tape of the match Hughes can be heard telling his corner after the fight [...] "I was out".|$|E
500|$|Richard {{admitted}} {{his initial}} {{fears of the}} portrayal because {{he felt it was}} a taboo subject. He had difficulties portraying it initially, this <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not familiar with the subject. [...] "The storyline had not been tackled in British soap opera before and Richardson felt Ste was [...] "making television history". He then explained how the storyline differs from other soap operas because [...] "Ste doesn't question his sexuality and it's not about a struggle — it's about domestic abuse in a gay relationship." [...] Richardson also stated because of the plots dark nature, he hoped viewers would be [...] "drawn into it". He branded the storyline as unpredictable because viewers never know if Brendan was going kiss or hit Ste.|$|E
500|$|Tynan {{remarked to}} Olivier, [...] "you aren't really a contemplative or {{philosophical}} actor"; Olivier {{was known for}} the strenuous physicality of his performances in some roles. He told Tynan this <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> influenced {{as a young man}} by Douglas Fairbanks, Ramon Navarro and John Barrymore in films, and Barrymore on stage as Hamlet: [...] "tremendously athletic. I admired that greatly, all of us did.... One thought of oneself, idiotically, skinny as I was, as a sort of Tarzan." [...] According to Morley, Gielgud was widely considered [...] "the best actor in the world from the neck up and Olivier from the neck down." [...] Olivier described the contrast thus: [...] "I've always thought that we were the reverses of the same coin... the top half John, all spirituality, all beauty, all abstract things; and myself as all earth, blood, humanity." ...|$|E

500|$|The breakthrough—the {{details of}} which are still classified—was {{apparently}} {{the separation of the}} fission and fusion components of the weapons, and to use the X-rays produced by the fission bomb to first compress the fusion fuel (by process known as [...] "radiation implosion") before igniting it. Ulam's idea seems to have been to use mechanical shock from the primary to encourage fusion in the secondary, while Teller quickly realized that X-rays from the primary would do the job much more symmetrically. Some members of the laboratory (J. Carson Mark in particular) later expressed the opinion that the idea to use the x-rays would have eventually occurred to anyone working on the physical processes involved, and that the obvious reason why Teller thought of it right away <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> already working on the [...] "Greenhouse" [...] tests for the spring of 1951, in which the effect of [...] x-rays from a fission bomb on a mixture of deuterium and tritium was going to be investigated.|$|E
500|$|American {{science fiction}} {{magazines}} had by the mid-1930s begun to publish some more sophisticated stories than the straightforward adventure fiction {{that was a}} staple of the earliest years of the genre. [...] Gillings decided that many British science fiction readers would not be familiar with most of the developments in American sf, and so he did not make a point of seeking innovative and original material. [...] The first issue contained [...] "The Perfect Creature", an early story by John Wyndham, under the name [...] "John Beynon", as well as [...] "The Prr-r-eet", by Eric Frank Russell. [...] The second issue included Wyndham's novel Sleepers of Mars, and William F. Temple's [...] "Lunar Lilliput", which was Temple's first science fiction sale. [...] "Stenographer's Hands", a story by David H. Keller, also appeared in the second issue, reprinted from a U.S. magazine; Gillings claimed that this was to introduce British science fiction readers to American developments in sf, but in fact it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> having trouble obtaining good quality material from British writers.|$|E
500|$|Wallace {{traveled}} to California in February 1997 {{to promote his}} upcoming album and record a music video for its lead single, [...] "Hypnotize". On March 5, 1997 he gave a radio interview with The Dog House on KYLD in San Francisco. In the interview he stated that he had hired security since he feared for his safety; this <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a celebrity figure in general, {{not because he was}} a rapper. Life After Death was scheduled for release on March 25, 1997. On January 8, 1997, Biggie Smalls and Sean [...] "Puffy" [...] Combs made a video for the song [...] "What's Beef", directed by Dave Meyers.
