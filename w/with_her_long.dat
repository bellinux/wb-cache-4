5|$|Aguilera {{announced}} via Twitter on September 12, 2012 {{that the}} album would be titled Lotus. The album artwork {{was shot by}} fashion photographer Enrique Badulescu. Aguilera unveiled the cover on October 5, where she is shown nude <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>long,</b> blonde hair covering her nipples, while her vulva is shaded by a white light; she extends her arms emerging from a lotus flower.

Lotus was released on November 13, 2012 by RCA Records, but was leaked online on November 5.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{had waited}} until her {{academic}} rank was secure before becoming pregnant. She {{had a son}} in 1923, {{the same year that}} she became a full professor. Colleagues were surprised when she had the baby, as she had not mentioned being pregnant and she hid the physical evidence of her pregnancy <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>long</b> laboratory jacket. Morgan remembered the reaction of one male colleague when she told him the news; he said if she had five children like he did, she would have hardly noticed the new baby. Morgan's mother moved in with her and cared for the baby so that Morgan could work uninterrupted.|$|E

5|$|Pairs did not {{cooperate}} in feeding, {{at least not}} in a strict sense. All such reports are based on misunderstanding of an account by ornithologist Walter Buller of a pair kept in captivity obtaining wood-boring beetle larvae. According to this misunderstanding, which has become part of ecological folklore, the male would tear at the wood and open larval tunnels, thus allowing the female to probe deeply into the tunnels <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>long,</b> pliant bill. Rather, the divergent bills represent an extreme example of niche differentiation, reducing intraspecific competition between the sexes. This allowed the species to exploit a wide range of food sources in different microhabitats.|$|E

West Indian by origin, British by education, Carmel is unmistakable <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>long</b> dreadlocks and colourful clothing. Carmel is kept extremely busy in Walford as she has all the difficult cases - Mary Smith (Linda Davidson), a prostitute, whose baby, Annie, has been removed; Sue Osman (Sandy Ratcliff), a mentally unstable mother who is obsessed with her baby, Ali's, welfare; Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler), a self-destructing heroin addict, and jobless Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher), among others.|$|E

She struggles over her father's relationship with Leesha, whom she likes at first. When Lauren is 12, her uncle Peter takes her for her haircut and she returns home <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>long</b> straight hair cut into a hipper, shoulder-length cut. Her boyfriend Victor turns out to be the son of her mother's boyfriend, David McClaren, which causes Lauren to feel awkward and disgusted.

500|$|Cosima and Blandine {{remained}} with Anna Liszt until 1850, joined eventually by Daniel. Cosima's biographer George Marek describes Anna as [...] "a simple, uneducated, unworldly but warmhearted woman ... {{for the first}} time [...] experienced what it was to be touched by love". Of the sisters, Blandine was evidently the prettier; Cosima, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>long</b> nose and wide mouth was described as an [...] "ugly duckling". Although Liszt's relations with his children were formal and distant, he provided for them liberally, and ensured that they were well educated. Both girls were sent to Madame Bernard's, an exclusive boarding school, while Daniel was prepared for the prestigious Lycée Bonaparte.|$|E
500|$|The single's cover artwork sees Aguilera [...] "nearly" [...] naked, {{wrapping}} in a [...] "sheer blush-colored" [...] {{piece of}} fabric and barely covering her breasts <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>long</b> flowing hair, while her arms are outstretched over her head. It also features Aguilera's [...] "all curves"; TJ from Neon Limelight called the cover [...] "sizzling" [...] and wrote that it features her [...] "bodacious curves on full display". Rebecca Macatee of E! Online labelled the artwork [...] "an R-rated recreation" [...] of [...] "Genie in a Bottle". MTV Buzzworthy's Byron Flitsch praised the cover, calling it [...] "a stunning cover art that has rendered us totally speechless". Fuse's Nicole James and Andrew Stout from SF Weekly compared Aguilera's {{image on the}} artwork to that of Marilyn Monroe in the photo shoot The Last Sitting.|$|E
500|$|Vocalist MayKay {{has been}} {{described}} as one of Ireland's [...] "most mesmerising front women" [...] in recent history, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>long</b> black hair and banshee wail provoking male fans to confess simultaneous feelings of terror and attraction online. She is known to vociferate lyrics such as [...] "you're like Kentucky Fried Chicken but without the taste" [...] and [...] "you're a fucking disappointment to the human race", taken from the song [...] "Jake Summers", a song inspired by former teen idol of California Dreams fame. Pockets writes most of the band's songs, plays the keyboard and provides vocals for some of the band's songs. Adrian and Tom tend to remain in the background, choosing not to be photographed. The band have never written anything fictional and their lyrics have been described by Nadine O'Regan in The Sunday Business Post as [...] "occasionally literally gynaecological in their detail and regularly relatively shocking in their honesty". MayKay and Pockets claim that most of their lyrics are shaped by one person who has broken each of their hearts.|$|E

500|$|While Monroe {{remains a}} {{cultural}} icon, critics are divided on her legacy as an actress. David Thomson called her {{body of work}} [...] "insubstantial" [...] and Pauline Kael wrote {{that she could not}} act, but rather [...] "used her lack of an actress's skills to amuse the public. She had the wit or crassness or desperation to turn cheesecake into acting – and vice versa; she did what others had the 'good taste' not to do". In contrast, according to Peter Bradshaw, Monroe was a talented comedian who [...] "understood how comedy achieved its effects", and [...] Roger Ebert wrote that [...] "Monroe's eccentricities and neuroses on sets became notorious, but studios put up <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>long</b> after any other actress would have been blackballed because what they got back on the screen was magical". Similarly, Jonathan Rosenbaum stated that [...] "she subtly subverted the sexist content of her material" [...] and that [...] "the difficulty some people have discerning Monroe's intelligence as an actress seems rooted in the ideology of a repressive era, when superfeminine women weren't supposed to be smart".|$|E

[...] Sonia Saraiya of Nerve ranked Rapunzel fourth {{in her article}} [...] "Ranked: Disney Princesses From Least To Most Feminist". Comparing the character's spirited personality to that of preceding Disney Princesses Ariel and Jasmine from Aladdin (1992), Saraiya described Rapunzel as [...] "badass," [...] {{despite the fact that}} [...] "her naivete sometimes {{gets in the way of}} her progressivism." [...] Saraiya continued, [...] " [...] also recognizes the unfairness of her plight and finds a way out of it, outwitting her 'mother,' who is in fact her kidnapper, to venture to the outside world." [...] Tala Dayrit of Female Network included Rapunzel in her article [...] "30 Fierce and Fun Female Cartoon Characters", writing that, unlike her original fairy tale counterpart, [...] "She’s not the helpless damsel locked in a tower awaiting an unknown fate, but a strong woman capable of defending herself in a fight." ...|$|E

2500|$|The New Yorker {{describes}} {{what it calls}} this [...] "strangely but tellingly misbegotten" [...] cover design thusly: [...] "The image is a photograph, taken from a French fashion shoot, of a glassy-eyed, heavily made-up little girl. Behind her sits, a mother figure, stiff and coiffed, casting an ominous shadow. The girl, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>long,</b> perfectly waved platinum-blond hair and her pink feather boa, looks like a pretty and inert doll—" [...] The article continues: [...] "And if the Stepford daughter on the cover is meant {{to remind us of}} Veruca Salt or Violet Beauregarde, she doesn't: those badly behaved squirts are bubbling over with rude life." [...] Moreover, writes Talbot, [...] "The Modern Classics cover has not a whiff of this validation of childish imagination; instead, it seems to imply a deviant adult audience." ...|$|E

He returned Tartars Prize to sea in September, where she promptly sprang a leak and started taking on 18 inches of water each hour. Forced back into port for repairs, Baillie wrote to Admiralty requesting stronger decking and timbers so that the hull would not keep opening up at the seams.|$|E
