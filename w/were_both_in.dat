5|$|Garrard was {{regarded}} as a strong chief executive who surrounded himself with knowledgeable advisors. His friend, John Edwards, and his son, William Garrard, <b>were</b> <b>both</b> <b>in</b> the state senate and kept him abreast of issues there.

Garrard then appointed Harry Toulmin, who had resigned the presidency of Transylvania Seminary in April due to opposition from the institution's more conservative trustees. Although he did not retain outgoing Attorney General John Breckinridge, who had sided with Logan in the disputed gubernatorial election, Garrard still frequently consulted with him on complex legal questions.|$|E

While a member of Oh-OK, Sweet also began collaborating with Michael Stipe as the band Community Trolls.|$|E
5|$|Romeo and Juliet {{may be the}} most-filmed play of all time. The {{most notable}} {{theatrical}} releases were George Cukor's multi-Oscar-nominated 1936 production, Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 version, and Baz Luhrmann's 1996 MTV-inspired Romeo + Juliet. The latter two <b>were</b> <b>both,</b> <b>in</b> their time, the highest-grossing Shakespeare film ever. Romeo and Juliet was first filmed in the silent era, by Georges Méliès, although his film is now lost. The play was first heard on film in The Hollywood Revue of 1929, in which John Gilbert recited the balcony scene opposite Norma Shearer.|$|E
5|$|The main {{building}} designed by Lange is in historicism and was originally built in two stories in brick. A third was {{added in the}} 1950s, some {{with some of the}} original feel being lost in the addition, since it was not stylistically true. In 1965 two annexes were built, one on each side and in two stories. The western was used for offices and the other as part of the waiting area—these <b>were</b> <b>both</b> <b>in</b> line with the historicist style. They replaced a cargo expedition and a restaurant building, respectively. In 1995 the bus station was moved from the city center at Leüthenhaven to the central station, and the eastern annex was razed in favor of a postmodernistic glass and concrete building. In addition to the bus station it features and extension of the waiting area, offices, a restaurant and a parking lot.|$|E

5|$|Norway Airlines {{applied in}} 1990 for {{permission}} to operate a charter route from Oslo to Penang, Malaysia, using a Boeing 757. The application was dismissed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications to protect SAS' route from Copenhagen to Singapore. The Penang route was necessary for Norway Airlines to procure a third aircraft, which {{according to the company}} was necessary to generate a profit, and would have created 100 new jobs. In the mean time, Tjæreborg Reiser sent their charter passengers with scheduled flights to London and onwards with British carriers to Malaysia. The dismissal was appealed to Minister of Transport and Communications, Lars Gunnar Lie of the Christian Democratic Party. The issue became a political issue within Syse's Cabinet, as the Conservative Party and the Progress Party <b>were</b> <b>both</b> <b>in</b> favor of increased deregulation of the airline industry. The issue was complicated by the common aviation policy of the three Scandinavian counties, which had largely been established to protect SAS' interest on international services. The cabinet therefore opened for discussion a further deregulation with the governments of Sweden and Denmark. The Conservative Party stated that this was in part a response to Danish and Swedish authorities allowing charter services to Phuket, Thailand, which could be seen as competing to SAS' route to Bangkok. Syse's Cabiet resigned on 3 November over issues regarding Norway and the European Union, before a reply to the application could be made.|$|E
5|$|Okafor and Alexander vied {{for a host}} {{of local}} and {{national}} player of the year awards, with each winning multiple national player of the year awards.

Despite forfeiting all wins in CPL games, Curie remained eligible to compete in the IHSA playoffs due to differences in eligibility rules. On March 4, Curie lost their opening IHSA playoff game to 11–11 DuSable High School by an 88–85 margin in overtime. It marked Curies first loss of the season on the court with Alexander in the lineup. Alexander posted 25 points, 15 rebounds, and 8 blocks despite fouling out in the final minute of regulation time. Curie trailed 13–2 early and led 47–32 midway through the third quarter. Curie starters Josh and Joseph Stamps were ineligible for IHSA play as was Malik Washington.|$|E
