5|$|Near human {{habitation}} {{the main}} predator {{of the common}} blackbird is the domestic cat, <b>with</b> <b>newly</b> fledged young especially vulnerable. Foxes and predatory birds, such as the sparrowhawk and other accipiters, also take this species when the opportunity arises.

5|$|A {{remake of}} the game, simply titled Ever 17, was {{developed}} for Xbox 360 by 5pb. in collaboration with Cyberfront. It was originally planned to be released on July 28, 2011, but was delayed to December 1, 2011. It was made available in both a standard edition and a limited edition, the latter including a 2-disc soundtrack. The remake was redone from the ground up, and includes new event graphics, re-recorded voices, new routes, and a new ending. It uses 3D models for the conversation scenes; this move from 2D to 3D was made as 3D character models were seen as easier to animate than 2D sprites, {{as they can be}} posed without the need to draw new poses manually. The setting was redesigned, <b>with</b> <b>newly</b> added facilities, and Tsugumi was given redesigned clothes.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the fire}} is quickly brought under control, Prescott is {{completely}} cut off. News of the events in Spoke City soon arrives on Tracy Island.

Lowered into the shaft in a protective cage fitted with diacetylene sprinklers, Virgil and Alan clamp the stricken lift and return to ground level, whereupon Prescott is arrested. Police Commissioner Garfield notes that classified documentation regarding criminal organisations, including the Erdman Gang, has been destroyed in the fire. Prescott's claims about the hitch-hiker are validated when the charred remnants of the bracelet are discovered.|$|E
5|$|Blomqvist joined Enköpings SK as a {{coach in}} 2008 {{and went on to}} make a playing return in the Superettan, the second tier of Swedish football. Ironically, a {{shortage}} of players at the club due to injury forced Blomqvist's playing return. The player shortage was highlighted when Blomqvist was sent off in his second game for the club. This resulted in a suspension for Blomqvist, and Enköping only having fifteen players available for the following match. On 15 September 2008, he scored his first professional goal in five years in a 1–0 win against IK Sirius. In total, he made 10 Superettan appearances, but was unable to save Enköping from relegation to Division 1 for the 2009 season. He left Enköping after the season and later signed a contract <b>with</b> <b>newly</b> relegated Hammarby IF as assistant manager to Michael Borgqvist.|$|E
