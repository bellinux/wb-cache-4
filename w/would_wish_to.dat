25|$|Souter also {{disagrees with}} the Court's {{rejection}} of Ex parte Young, noting that where Chilicky was {{a rejection of the}} extra-statutory remedy proposed, Young was merely a jurisdictional device. Souter found it implausible that Congress <b>would</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> see their statute made completely unenforceable simply because they had included a remedy for those injured by the failure of states to abide by it.|$|E
500|$|The King {{signed the}} Instrument of Abdication on 10 December 1936, in the {{presence}} of his three surviving brothers, the Duke of York (who would ascend the throne the following day as George VI), the Duke of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent. Special laws passed by the Parliaments of the Dominions finalised Edward's abdication the following day, or in Ireland's case one day later. On 11 December 1936, Edward said in a radio broadcast, [...] "I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility, and to discharge my duties as King as I <b>would</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> do, without the help and support of the woman I love." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the night}} of 11 December 1936, Edward, now reverted to the title and style of a prince, {{explained}} his decision to abdicate in a worldwide radio broadcast. He famously said, [...] "I have {{found it impossible to}} carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king as I <b>would</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> do without the help and support of the woman I love." [...] Edward departed Britain for Austria the following day; he was unable to join Simpson until her divorce became absolute, several months later. His brother, Prince Albert, Duke of York, succeeded to the throne as George VI. George VI's elder daughter, Princess Elizabeth, became heiress presumptive.|$|E
500|$|The Shakespeare Gallery, when {{it opened}} on 4 May 1789, {{contained}} 34 paintings, {{and by the end}} of its run it had between 167 and 170. [...] (The exact inventory is uncertain and most of the paintings have disappeared; only around 40 paintings can be identified with any certainty.) According to Frederick Burwick, during its sixteen-year operation, the Gallery reflected the transition from Neoclassicism to Romanticism. Works by artists such as James Northcote represent the conservative, neoclassical elements of the gallery, while those of Henry Fuseli represent the newly emerging Romantic movement. William Hazlitt praised Northcote in an essay entitled [...] "On the Old Age of Artists", writing [...] "I conceive any person would be more struck with Mr. Fuseli at first sight, but <b>would</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> visit Mr. Northcote oftener." ...|$|E
500|$|Taube {{was born}} November 30, 1915 in Neudorf, Saskatchewan as the {{youngest}} of four boys. [...] His parents were German ethnics from Ukraine which had immigrated to Saskatchewan from the Ukraine in 1911. [...] Growing up, his first language was Low German. [...] In the 1700s, Catherine the Great encouraged Central European farmers to settle in Russia. [...] As the rights afforded to these settlers by Catherine were gradually diminished, many of the settlers headed to North America, with Saskatchewan offering good farmland, and other incentives for immigrants. Taube reflected fondly on his experiences growing up in Saskatchewan, noting: [...] "Certainly, there is nothing about my first 21 years in Saskatchewan, taken {{in the context of}} those times that I <b>would</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> be changed. [...] The advantages that I enjoyed include: [...] the marvelous experience of growing up on a farm, which taught me an appreciation of nature, and taught me also to discipline myself to get necessary jobs done..." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1668, the King {{appointed}} Rupert {{to be the}} Constable of Windsor Castle. Rupert {{was already}} one of the Knights of the Garter, who had their headquarters at the castle, and was a close companion of the King, who <b>would</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> be suitably entertained at the castle. Rupert immediately began to reorder the castle's defences, sorting out the garrison's accommodation, repairing the Devil's Tower, reconstructing the real tennis court and improving the castle's hunting estate. Rupert acquired his own apartments in the castle, which were recorded as being [...] "very singular" [...] with some decorated with an [...] "extraordinary" [...] number of [...] "pikes, muskets, pistols, bandoliers, holsters, drums, back, breast, and head pieces", and his inner chambers [...] "hung with tapisserie, curious and effeminate pictures". King Charles II and Rupert spent much time together over the years hunting and playing tennis together at Windsor, and Rupert was also a close companion of James, the Duke of York. Rupert was considered by Pepys to be the fourth best tennis player in England.|$|E
500|$|While in Buffalo, McKinley had {{two days}} of events: [...] On Thursday, September 5, he was to deliver his address and then tour the fair. [...] The {{following}} day, he was to visit Niagara Falls, and, on his return to Buffalo, meet the public at the Temple of Music on the Exposition grounds. [...] Part {{of the reason for}} bringing McKinley repeatedly to the fair was to swell the gate receipts; the popular President's visit was heavily advertised. [...] The public reception at the Temple of Music was disliked by his personal secretary, George B. Cortelyou, who, concerned for the President's security, twice tried to remove it from the program. [...] McKinley each time restored it; he wished to support the fair (he agreed with its theme of hemispheric cooperation), enjoyed meeting people, and was not afraid of potential assassins. [...] When Cortelyou asked McKinley a final time to remove the event from the schedule, the President responded, [...] "Why should I? [...] No one <b>would</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> hurt me." [...] Cortelyou warned McKinley that many would be disappointed since the President would not have time to shake hands with all who would line up to meet him. McKinley responded, [...] "Well, they'll know I tried, anyhow." [...] Unable to persuade the President to alter his schedule, Cortelyou telegraphed to authorities in Buffalo, asking them to arrange extra security.|$|E
500|$|The scripts {{were written}} by Ohkawa and Fujisaku. While Ohkawa took charge of each episode's dialogue, Fujisaku handled fight sequences. Fujisaku pointedly avoided {{contributing}} too much to the dialogue as Ohkawa's writing had a very distinctive style, his alterations made only due to story inconsistencies. The series was composed {{in a way that}} gradually revealed the central mystery while pitting Saya against progressively stronger foes. The setting's intensely [...] "normal" [...] appearance was designed to make viewers feel uneasy as faults begin appearing in Saya's everyday life. According to Ohkawa, the main theme of the series was examination of the hero's role as a lonely protector of the innocent. Alongside this was the portrayal of Saya's seemingly normal life and now her role as the town's protector began intruding upon this everyday life. The final episodes were intended to evoke viewer sympathy for Saya due to the terrible ordeal she had been subjected to. The series broke from conventions of a hero-focused anime by portraying the relationships between Saya and those close to her in a very shallow way during the opening episodes. For the final few episodes, when the truth is revealed about Saya and her school life, the supporting cast were generally portrayed as [...] "hateful" [...] people that the viewers <b>would</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> see die. So as to keep the series' twist ending a secret, the entire voice cast including Mizuki and Nojima—the respective voice actors of Saya and Fumito—were told nothing about the final episode's events. A different interview revealed that each cast member were only given the scripts for three episodes at any one time to preserve secrecy. The subtitle of each episode was drawn from the Japanese poetry anthology Ogura Hyakunin Isshu. The series made regular use of bloody violence, which was exaggerated to distance viewers from the show's horrific elements. Despite this, the director said the show was not deliberately focused on bloody violence.|$|E
