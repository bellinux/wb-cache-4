6000|$|The more {{important}} part of Mr. Forster's fresh material is to come in future volumes, if now, alas! we are ever to have them. For {{some of what he}} gives us in this we can hardly thank him. One of the manuscripts he has unearthed is the original version of [...] "Baucis and Philemon" [...] as it was before it had passed under the criticism of Addison. He seems to think it in some respects better than the revised copy though in our judgment it entirely justifies the wisdom of the critic who counselled its curtailment and correction. The piece as we have hitherto had it comes as near poetry as anything Swift ever wrote except [...] "Cadenus and Vanessa," [...] though neither of them aspires above the region of cleverness and fancy. Indeed, it is misleading to talk of the poetry of one whose fatal gift was an eye that disidealized. But we are not concerned here with the discussion of Swift's claim to the title of poet. What <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> is to protest in the interests of good literature against the practice, now too common, of hunting out and printing what the author would doubtless have burned. It is unfair to the dead writer and the living reader by disturbing that unitary impression which every good piece of work aims at making, and is sure to make, only in proportion to the author's self-denial and his skill in ...|$|E
6000|$|Observe, reader, {{that we do}} {{not intend}} here to imply an invidious comparison. We have no sympathy with those who hold that England was and always is in favour of fair play, while France was bent on tyranny. On the contrary, we believe that England has in some {{instances}} been guilty of the sin which we now condemn, and that, on the other hand, many Frenchmen of the present day would disapprove of the policy of France in the time of Napoleon the First. Neither do we sympathise with the famous saying of Nelson that [...] "one Englishman is equal to three Frenchmen!" [...] The tendency to praise one's-self has always been regarded among Christian nations as a despicable, or at least a pitiable, quality, and we confess that we cannot see much difference between a boastful man and a boastful nation. Frenchmen have always displayed chivalrous courage, not a whit inferior to the British, and history proves that in war they have been eminently successful. The question whether they could beat us or we could beat them, if tested in a fair stand-up fight with equal numbers, besides being an unprofitable one, is not now before us. All that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> at present is, that in the war now under consideration the British did beat the French, and we rejoice to record the fact solely on the ground that we fought in a righteous cause.|$|E

50|$|A typical {{example is}} Bode's law, which {{provides}} a simple numerical rule for the distances of the planets {{in the solar system}} from the Sun. Once the rule has been derived, through the trial and error matching of various rules with the observed data (exploratory data analysis), there are not enough planets remaining for a rigorous and independent test of the hypothesis (confirmatory data analysis).

If <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> what Bode's law tells us about the cause system of planetary distribution then we demand confirmation that will not be available until better information about other planetary systems becomes available.|$|E
