5|$|He {{is always}} there, he knows everything. He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is {{typically}} emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He {{can take on}} any shape, but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a Hardy Boys novel begins, which is of course the only time <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> to see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons {{and put them in}} mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, yet he is always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the Boys have to drive to Canada or Florida or somewhere to retrieve it. I suppose he isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.|$|E
2500|$|Also citing McFly as {{influences}} are British pop {{rock band}} The Vamps, who supported McFly on their 2013 [...] Guitarist and vocalist James McVey stated [...] "McFly is a band {{we love to}} be compared to over other bands, simply for the fact of their good musicianship. They write very well and they're very energetic on stage, which is something we try to replicate in our own performances." [...] Drummer Tristan Evans also spoke of the band, explaining [...] "McFly were an influence on me wanting to get into music and we feel like {{the next generation of}} their take on pop," [...] while bassist Connor Ball continued [...] "They're chilled-out and we hope we can have that calm attitude if <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> that successful." [...] Frontman Brad Simpson also referred to McFly when asked about influences, stating [...] "Their debut album was a first in all of our collections". The band credited their support slot as providing an opportunity to observe the band's skills for their own development. Simpson said [...] "How to provide more energy to our performance and move around the stage was a massive one...McFly have been doing it for years and the little things we picked up have really improved our live performance." [...] McVey also referred to the band's influence on performances by the Vamps, stating [...] "Before I had seen them in concert, I would never have performed as we do now." [...] The Vamps have covered several songs by McFly in a series of YouTube videos including Love Is Easy, performed alongside Fletcher's sister Carrie Hope Fletcher, [...] "That Girl", filmed as a recreation of the music video including appearances from Poynter, and finally [...] "Five Colours in Her Hair", which featured on the digital EP for their second single [...] "Wild Heart". Their debut album, Meet the Vamps featured the song [...] "High Hopes" [...] which was co-written by Fletcher, Jones and Poynter and produced by Jones. When The Vamps were compared to Australian band 5 Seconds of Summer, Simpson said [...] "We both have a shared admiration for McFly. They've shaped the music of our generation... We find ourselves going to the same minor guitar chords like McFly would." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, so you be!" [...] Sampson cried, eyeing {{them up and}} down. [...] "I thought, when I heard you, as it {{was they}} folk from Claxton as comes 'ere for bait {{whenever}} they be short.

6000|$|... "Child, child! How in {{the world}} did <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> here so quick? And is it all real? And are we to stay here, as she says? And what does it all mean, anyhow?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But how can <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> to England in a {{small boat}} like this?" [...] asked the middy, in much anxiety, for in the hurry and {{excitement}} of the start the difficulty had not occurred to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Marco, [...] "but {{then they}} know that they can get out {{whenever}} they please. We don't know that <b>we</b> can <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> out." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Why, yes; we {{had talked}} of it for some time. We cannot remain here always. My cousins De Crécy are there, and my aunt De Coudremont. We shall be among friends, Pétronelle, if <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{shall have}} good lays, depend on it. As for yourself, Captain Gar'ner, I trust my owners will not forget {{to do what}} is right, if <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> home, and meet with luck in the market." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Stobell {{brought up}} {{in front of him and}} frowned thoughtfully. [...] "I suppose you’re right," [...] he said, slowly; [...] "but if <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> off this chicken-perch, and I run across him, let him look out, that’s all." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't suppose <b>we</b> shall <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> there," [...] Ruth said. [...] "Amuba {{said the}} other day that this country lay a great {{distance}} further than the land my people came from a long time ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, mother, {{somebody}} {{has got to}} fight the French," [...] insisted the son. [...] "If we don't fight them, and whip them, how shall <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> back to our home? I don't want to give all that up, do you?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "All things {{begin in}} some wonder, {{and in some}} wonder end," [...] said St. Augustine, wisest in his day of mortal men.

"It {{might be}} {{well for us}} if we could follow him," [...] {{returned}} the man, shaking his head despondingly, [...] "for we are getting into {{the end of a}} bay up here {{at the head of the}} lake, and it is uncertain whether <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> out of it again!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But how did <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> out of Paris? I was smothered under {{a pile of}} cabbages, with Lucienne on {{one side}} of me and Esther, unconscious, on the other. I could see nothing. I know we halted at the barrier. I thought we would be recognised, turned back! My God! how I trembled!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Madame de Lescure {{immediately}} {{jumped at}} the proposal. [...] "For heaven's sake, Arthur, do so, if it be possible," [...] said she; [...] "it will be the greatest relief. I do not think <b>we</b> should <b>ever</b> <b>get</b> across to the other boat, if we once leave this." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I fancy we {{can stand}} up under the strain and perils.

6000|$|... "She's {{as tight}} as a bottle with a sealed cork, Gar'ner," [...] cried Daggett, {{a few hours after}} his craft was at her anchor, meeting his brother-master at his own gangway, and shaking hands with him cordially.

6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Angelo, [...] "you {{understand}} it now. And {{it stands to}} reason that the arrangement couldn't be improved. I'll prove it to you.

6000|$|... "If Mr. Harvey {{knew what}} I had done he'd give over {{trying to help}} me along, in case <b>we</b> <b>ever</b> do <b>get</b> out of this scrape," [...] he said to himself. [...] "I ain't fit even to carry a message, let alone trying to help a regular detective." ...|$|R
