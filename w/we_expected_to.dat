Tanner recalls saying to Wilson, [...] "I've got the wrong sort of hair to be on stage with you fellas", to which Wilson replied: [...] "We'll give you a Prince Valiant wig." [...] The Beach Boys then requested the services of Walter Sear, who asked Bob Moog to design a ribbon controller, since the group was used to playing the fretboards of a guitar. Sears remembers marking fretboard-like lines on the ribbon [...] "so they could play the damn thing." [...] Moog began manufacturing his own models of theremins.

2500|$|Some {{argue that}} these {{reductions}} in infectious disease {{are a result of}} improved sanitation and hygiene (rather than vaccination), or that these diseases were already in decline before the introduction of specific vaccines.

A Centers for Disease Control website aimed at countering common misconceptions about vaccines argued, [...] "Are <b>we</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> believe that better sanitation caused incidence of each disease to drop, just at the time a vaccine for that disease was introduced?" ...|$|E

Dupont now had over 20,000 men idling along the Guadalquivir while the Spaniards massed and approached. But supplies were scarce and the Spanish peasants had deserted their fields, obliging Dupont's wearied men {{to bring in the}} harvest, grind the grain, and bake their own rations; 600 men fell ill during their fortnight's stay by drinking the putrid waters of the Guadalquivir.

Spatial Area comprises statistics about the area in which a user roams, its shape, size and extent. <b>We</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> distinguish users with different areal patterns, i.e. users who visit small, compact regions and those who roam in the entire country. Spatial Distance comprises statistics about the spatial path of a user, its stages and its distance covered. <b>We</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> distinguish users with mostly short trips and those with mostly long journeys. Spatial Variability comprises features relating to the variability of a user’s location in space. <b>We</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> distinguish spatially stable users, roaming between a few distinct clusters, and spatially volatile users, visiting many locations dispersed in space. Finally, Spatio-Temporal Dynamics relate to the behavior of a user in space and time. <b>We</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> distinguish users with continuous and variable movement patterns, the former moving uniformly, and the latter changing their mobility dynamics over time. The 32 features serve as a basis for dividing the individual users into distinct groups and for inferring user types.

2500|$|The {{end of the}} war and {{emancipation}} brought both jubilation and anxiety, many {{not knowing}} how to restructure their lives. At emancipation some slaveowners reacted by evicting all former slaves from their properties, others negotiated work contracts or sharecropping arrangements. Since few of these agreements were legally contracted, and the newly freed slaves had little access to the legal system, they were often victimized. Former Kanawha County slave Lizzie Grant explained- [...] "Slavery had not ended, no we just went from slaves to peons...They did free them in one sense of the word, but put them in a whole lot worse shape as they turned them loose to make their own way with nothing to make it with...e mostly had to stay with our [...] if we got anything...e were forced to stay on as servants, yes, if <b>we</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> live...hey still made us do just like they wanted to after the war." ...|$|E
2500|$|The IBM {{archives}} of Frequently Asked Questions notes an inquiry {{about whether he}} said in the 1950s that he foresaw a market potential for only five electronic computers. The document says no, but quotes his son and then IBM President Thomas J. Watson, Jr., at the annual IBM stockholders meeting, April 28, 1953, as speaking about the IBM 701 Electronic Data Processing Machine, which it identifies as [...] "the company's first production computer designed for scientific calculations". He said that [...] "IBM had developed a paper plan for such a machine and took this paper plan across the country to some 20 concerns that we thought could use such a machine. I would like {{to tell you that the}} machine rents for between $12,000 and $18,000 a month, so it was not the type of thing that could be sold from place to place. But, as a result of our trip, on which <b>we</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> get orders for five machines, we came home with orders for 18." [...] Watson, Jr., later gave a slightly different version of the story in his autobiography, where he said the initial market sampling indicated 11 firm takers and 10 more prospective orders.|$|E
2500|$|Columnist Barbara Ellen of The Observer {{ridiculed}} the pomposity {{of some of}} the unfavourable {{reviews in}} her column on Sunday 28 March 2010, in a jokey [...] "Open letter to London's famous Adelphi theatre": [...] "Dear Mr Adelphi, Regarding the performance I viewed last week of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom sequel, Love Never Dies, ridiculed as Paint Never Dries. With regret, I must demand my money back; it simply wasn't bad or boring enough. My companions and I paid our money and went along in good faith, expecting a right old disaster. Imagine our disappointment when it was good. The phantom bore an eerie resemblance to Martin Amis sulking after his tiff with Anna Ford, but, sir, this was not enough. A catastrophe we were promised and a catastrophe <b>we</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> see. One concedes that it is not all the production's fault. Negative reviews, the dark art of anti-hype, are a dangerous business. However, do fine feelings pay my babysitter? I feel that I, and several innocent coach parties, were tricked into going to Paint Never Dries, and, against our will, forced to endure an enjoyable evening. I'm sure I speak for many when I say I left your theatre wholly dissatisfied with how incredibly satisfied I felt".|$|E

2500|$|Renowned {{throughout}} his career for his capacity to provide very specific technical details about the performance of his cars and track conditions long {{before the advent of}} telemetry, this characteristic [...] led Senna's first F1 race engineer, Pat Symonds, to regard the US Grand Prix in Dallas as the initial highlight of Senna's debut season, instead of the more popular Monaco, where Senna and Toleman scored their first podium finish. This is by reference to the following recollection given by Symonds in an interview in 2014, to mark the 20th anniversary of Senna's death:The car was reasonably competitive there, so <b>we</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> have a good race but Ayrton spun early in the race. He then found his way back through the field in a quite effective way and we were looking for a pretty good finish but then he hit the wall, damaged the rear wheel and the driveshaft and retired, which was a real shame. The real significance of that was that when he came back to the pits he told me what happened and said [...] "I'm sure that the wall moved!" [...] and even though I've heard every excuse every driver has ever made, I certainly hadn't heard of that one! But Ayrton being Ayrton, with his incredible belief in himself, the absolute conviction, he then talked me into going with him, after the race, {{to have a look at}} the place where he had crashed. And he was absolutely right, which was the amazing thing! Dallas being a street circuit the track was surrounded by concrete blocks and what had happened – we could see it from the tyre marks – was that someone had hit at the far end of the concrete block and that made it swivel slightly, so that the leading edge of the block was standing out by a few millimetres. And he was driving with such precision that those few millimetres were the difference between hitting the wall and not hitting the wall. While I had been, at first, annoyed that we had retired from the race through a driver error, when I saw what had happened, when I saw how he had been driving, that increased my respect for the guy by quite a lot.|$|E
