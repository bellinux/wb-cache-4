5|$|August 6, 2015: Hurricane Guillermo {{interacted with}} a longwave trough in the {{subtropical}} jet to its northeast to spawn a rare dry-season atmospheric river, which {{went on to}} send moisture toward the San Francisco Bay Area, bringing a rare lightning storm to that area that night. Since the storm <b>was</b> <b>dry</b> and hardly brought any rain, the NWS issued a Red Flag Warning for that area.|$|E
5|$|Hygrometer: Prototype {{hygrometers}} were devised {{and developed}} in the hills during the Western Han dynasty in Ancient China to elucidate mechanisms of long-range meteorological fluctuations. The Chinese used a bar of charcoal and a lump of earth: its dry weight was taken and then compared with its damp weight after being exposed in the air. The differences in weight was used to tally the humidity level. Other techniques were applied using mass to measure humidity such as when the air <b>was</b> <b>dry,</b> the bar of charcoal would be light while the air was humid, the bar of charcoal would be heavy. By hanging a lump of earth and a bar of charcoal on the two ends of a staff separately and adding a fixated lifting string on the middle point to make the staff horizontal in dry air, an ancient hygrometer was made.|$|E

5|$|I was to {{keep the}} fish before me in a tin tray, and {{occasionally}} moisten the surface with alcohol from the jar... In ten minutes I had seen all that could be seen in that fish, and started in search of the Professor – who had, however, left the Museum; and when I returned, after lingering over some of the odd animals stored in the upper apartment, my specimen <b>was</b> <b>dry</b> all over. I dashed the fluid over the fish as if to resuscitate the beast from a fainting fit, and looked with anxiety for a return of the normal sloppy appearance. This little excitement over, nothing was done but to return to a steadfast gaze at my mute companion.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the rain-affected practice and qualifying sessions, the track <b>was</b> <b>dry</b> {{for the duration of}} the race. All of the drivers except Jenson Button, Jarno Trulli and the two Red Bull drivers started on the softer option tyre. The first lap was eventful: Alonso started better than polesitter Massa and was able to take the inside line into turn one and gain the lead. Hamilton passed Räikkönen for third into the first corner, then drove round the outside of Massa into turn two to take second place. Meanwhile, the suspension on Adrian Sutil's Spyker failed at turn four, causing it to collide with Button's Honda and retire from the race. Button continued after making an early pitstop to repair the damage. Liuzzi and Sato also collided at turn four, causing Liuzzi to pit for a new front wing. After the race the drivers blamed each other for the incident.|$|E

Upon their completion, Connecticut conducted gunnery practice off the Virginia Capes. On 23 October, Connecticut became the flagship of the Fourth Battleship Division. After the division passed in review before Secretary of the Navy George von Lengerke Meyer on the 25th, Connecticut left for Genoa, Italy, where she remained until 30 November. The battleship departed Italy for Vera Cruz and arrived on 23 December. She took refugees from Mexico to Galveston and carried officers of the Army and representative from the Red Cross back in the opposite direction.|$|E

5|$|There is {{evidence}} of human settlement at Little Thetford since the Neolithic Age. A 1996 search along the Anglian Water pipeline at Little Thetford—Cawdle Fen uncovered an important and unusually dense concentration of late Neolithic (3000–2201BC) remains. This is unusual because, although the fenland basin <b>was</b> <b>dry</b> and forested during the Mesolithic era, the area was sometimes subject to marine incursions, and at other times, fresh-water flooding. This led to marshes and open water areas {{which may have been}} difficult to settle on—except perhaps for seasonal activity. A Neolithic polished flint axe (4000–2201BC) was found in the village in 1984 at Bedwell Hey Farm. Fourteen pre-Roman flints of various finishes were also discovered in 1998 at the same site.|$|E

50|$|Foods <b>are</b> <b>dried</b> {{to inhibit}} {{microbial}} development and quality decay. However, {{the extent of}} drying depends on product end-use. Cereals and oilseeds <b>are</b> <b>dried</b> after harvest to the moisture content that allows microbial stability during storage. Vegetables <b>are</b> blanched before <b>drying</b> to avoid rapid darkening, and <b>drying</b> <b>is</b> not only carried out to inhibit microbial growth, but also to avoid browning during storage. Concerning dried fruits, the reduction of moisture acts in combination with its acid and sugar contents to provide protection against microbial growth. Products such as milk powder must <b>be</b> <b>dried</b> to very low moisture contents {{in order to ensure}} flowability and avoid caking. This moisture is lower than that required to ensure inhibition to microbial development. Other products as crackers <b>are</b> <b>dried</b> beyond the microbial growth threshold to confer a crispy texture, which is liked by consumers.|$|R
