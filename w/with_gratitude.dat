5|$|Scott (known then as Norman Josiffe) {{had first}} met Thorpe early in 1961 when the former was a 20-year-old groom working {{for one of}} Thorpe's wealthy friends. The initial meeting was brief, but nearly a year later Scott, by then in London and destitute, called at the House of Commons to ask the MP for help. Thorpe later {{acknowledged}} that a friendship had developed, but denied any physical relationship; Scott, on the other hand, claimed {{that he had been}} seduced by Thorpe on the night following the Commons meeting. Over the following years Thorpe made numerous attempts to help Scott to find accommodation and work, but instead of repaying these favours <b>with</b> <b>gratitude,</b> Scott became increasingly resentful to Thorpe, believing that he was the source of all his ills and threatening him with exposure.|$|E

25|$|Devotional Day: A day {{to honor}} the {{importance}} of God. Although DeMolay teaches no religious creed, members are encouraged to attend organized worship. Chapters usually attend a church, synagogue, or temple together as a chapter, hold a Bible study, or honor a pastor, deacon, or member of the clergy <b>with</b> <b>gratitude.</b> This day marks the second DeMolay Precept, Reverence for Sacred Things. A DeMolay learns tolerance of others' beliefs and appreciation for their own religious beliefs. Held close to March 18.|$|E
25|$|Carved on the left-side of the ashlar wall, of {{the tunnel}} {{entrance}} is an eroded inscription carved into rock, with decorated frame.

A comparable inscription is found on the right-side of the southeast ashlar wall entrance, consisting of a semi-eroded plaque , with the words: PATRIMÓNIO DO ESTADO. PRAÇA DE ARMAS (Patrimony of the State. Military Square).|$|E

25|$|At Leatherwood, Henry devoted {{himself to}} local {{affairs in the}} thinly-populated county, and was given seats on the county court (as {{prominent}} landowners were) and the parish vestry. He refused to be elected a delegate to Congress, stating that his personal business and past illness made that impossible. When Governor Jefferson sent a note to him in early 1780, Henry replied <b>with</b> <b>gratitude,</b> complaining of his isolation, and wrote of his many concerns {{about the state of}} affairs, as the war continued. The freeholders of Henry County soon thereafter sent its eponym to the House of Delegates. But within weeks, health problems recurred, causing his return to Leatherwood. While in Richmond (where the capital had been moved) Henry opposed a congressional plan to revalue Continental currency and impose certain taxes, feeling it would mostly benefit the North. He was successful in defeating it, but after he left Richmond, supporters got the legislature to pass it. Once he returned home, he was heavily involved in efforts to recruit local volunteers to suppress bands of Loyalists who were conducting raids in the frontier area. Henry rode with the troops, though he did not lead them, and they were generally successful in suppressing the resistance. The volunteers were disbanded in September 1780.|$|E
25|$|By this time, however, Hanaya {{has lost}} all his {{defiance}} and is filled only <b>with</b> <b>gratitude</b> towards the villagers. He promises to reward the village with two wagons of grain {{should he be}} released. The villagers agree and return the prisoners to the Japanese Army encampment in the nearby town. However, the Japanese Army has already made Hanaya a war hero, believing that {{he was killed in}} battle. Returning alive after being a prisoner shames the Army. The commander of the encampment, Captain Inokichi Sakatsuka (Kenya Sawada), gives Hanaya a merciless beating but feels honor-bound to fulfill the agreement between the latter and the village. Captain Sakatsuka and his men bring a great bounty of food and wine to the village and hold a feast there that evening, as Ma goes off to fetch his lover Yu'er (Jiang Hongbo) from a neighboring village. During the feast, Captain Sakatsuka demands to have the man who captured Hanaya. He also accuses Ma of sneaking off to fetch resistance fighters. Not given a satisfactory answer, he orders all villagers to be killed and the village to be burned. Ma and Yu'er return on a raft only to find the entire village in flames. Meanwhile, Hanaya is about to commit harakiri before being stopped by Captain Sakatsuka and informed that Japan has recently surrendered, and the war is over.|$|E

500|$|As {{the weeks}} passed, Heywood calmly {{occupied}} himself by resuming his {{studies of the}} Tahitian language. Meanwhile the family—Nessy in particular—busied itself on his behalf, and another plea was made to the Earl of Chatham, in heart-rending terms. Shortly afterwards came the first indication that a royal pardon was in the offing, and on 26 October, on Hector's quarterdeck, this was formally read to Heywood and Morrison by Captain Montagu. Heywood responded with a short statement that ended: [...] "I receive <b>with</b> <b>gratitude</b> my Sovereign's mercy, for which my future life will be faithfully devoted to his service." [...] According to a Dutch newspaper which reported the case, his contrition {{was accompanied by a}} [...] "flood of tears". William Muspratt, the only other of the accused to employ legal counsel, was reprieved on a legal technicality and pardoned in February 1793.|$|E
500|$|Modern-day {{historians have}} {{continued}} to characterize the battle as a wholesale massacre. Mark Grimsley, {{a history professor at}} Ohio State University, concluded in 2005, based on other modern accounts, that the Battle of Bad Axe would be better termed a massacre. Kerry A. Trask's 2007 work, Black Hawk: The Battle for the Heart of America, points to the writings of Wakefield as evidence that delusional beliefs about doing brave deeds and magnifying manliness spurred the U.S. forces to revel in and pursue massacring and exterminating the Sauk and Fox. Trask concluded that Wakefield's statement [...] "I must confess, that it filled my heart <b>with</b> <b>gratitude</b> and joy, to think that I had been instrumental, with many others, in delivering my country of those merciless savages, and restoring those people again to their peaceful homes and firesides," [...] was a viewpoint held by nearly all militia members.|$|E
500|$|On {{researching the}} history of UCL's Egyptology department, the {{historian}} Rosalind M. Janssen stated that Murray was [...] "remembered <b>with</b> <b>gratitude</b> and immense affection by all her former students. A wise and witty teacher, two generations of Egyptologists have forever been in her debt." [...] Alongside teaching them, Murray was known to socialise with her UCL students outside of class hours. The archaeologist Ralph Merrifield, who knew Murray through the Folklore Society, described her as a [...] "diminutive and kindly scholar, who radiated intelligence and strength of character into extreme old age". Davidson, who also knew Murray through the Society, noted that at their meetings [...] "she would sit near the front, a bent and seemingly guileless old lady dozing peacefully, {{and then in the}} middle of a discussion would suddenly intervene with a relevant and penetrating comment which showed that she had missed not one word of the argument". The later folklorist Juliette Wood noted that many members of the Folklore Society [...] "remember her fondly", adding that Murray had been [...] "especially keen to encourage younger researchers, even those who disagreed with her ideas".|$|E

500|$|Upon {{joining the}} cast of Tangled, Moore was {{initially}} unaware that the film was slated to be Walt Disney Animation Studios' 50th animated feature film. Since that time, she has received her ignorance <b>with</b> <b>gratitude,</b> explaining, [...] "I feel lucky because I would've probably felt a bit more pressure had I known going into the recording process." [...] Moore hardly worked with co-stars Zachary Levi and Donna Murphy, who provided the voices of Flynn Rider and Mother Gothel, respectively, never meeting Murphy and having only met Levi once to record their characters' duet [...] "I See the Light". Moore {{was surprised to learn}} that she would be isolated from her co-stars against initial expectations that [...] "we're all going to be chummy, hanging out at the studio laughing and going out to dinner together". Moore had little idea of what her character looked like because, in terms of visual aid, she was only provided with rough, incomplete sketches and storyboards, while [...] "everything else had to be explained" [...] by Howard and Greno. The majority of the images were created by Moore herself in her own mind.|$|E
500|$|Many reviewers {{took note}} of the rather overt {{religious}} symbolism in Simon's lyrics; one Irish blogger facetiously called So Beautiful or So What the year's best Christian music album, while American evangelical journalist Cathleen Falsani {{said it was the}} most significant record of spiritually reflective music in recent years. Writing for MSN Music, Robert Christgau found Simon's usual folk rock [...] "graced with global colors that sound as natural" [...] as his guitar and said his lyrics are imbued <b>with</b> <b>gratitude</b> for his wife's love and God, although he disagreed with Simon's view of God's benevolent nature. Andy Gill from The Independent was more critical and found Simon's ruminations on love, age, and mortality trivial, while Pitchfork Media critic Stephen M. Deusner said the record [...] "can be stodgy in its emotions and a bit too devoted to its motifs". At the end of 2011, So Beautiful or So What was voted the 14th best album of the year in The Village Voices Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide. Christgau, the poll's creator, ranked it 3rd on his year-end list for The Barnes & Noble Review. Rolling Stone also named it the year's 3rd best record, while Mojo ranked it 15th.|$|E
