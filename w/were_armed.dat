5|$|Connolly {{has argued}} that they <b>were</b> <b>armed</b> as a pike phalanx. This has been disputed by Head, because Plutarch states they carried spears shorter than the Roman triarii and by Daly {{because they could not}} have carried an {{unwieldy}} pike {{at the same time as}} a heavy Roman-style shield.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with Japanese carrier doctrine at the time, Admiral Nagumo had kept {{half of his}} aircraft in reserve. These comprised two squadrons each of dive bombers and torpedo bombers. The dive bombers were as yet unarmed. The torpedo bombers <b>were</b> <b>armed</b> with torpedoes should any American warships be located.|$|E
5|$|The 16th-century Spanish conquistadors <b>were</b> <b>armed</b> with one- and two-handed broadswords, lances, pikes, rapiers, halberds, crossbows, matchlocks {{and light}} artillery. Crossbows were easier to {{maintain}} than matchlocks, {{especially in the}} humid tropical climate of the Caribbean region that included much of the Yucatán Peninsula.|$|E

The Film Unit Lancaster also flew out of Bardney carrying three RAF cameramen {{as well as an}} Associated Press journalist and a radio reporter from the BBC. The Liberators departed Bardney just before the bombers, carrying McMullen, maintenance personnel and spare parts. The No. 540 Squadron Mosquito left Bardney the next day. Despite not being notified of the new plan until after all of the Lancasters were airborne, the Soviet military quickly agreed to the changed arrangements.|$|E
5|$|Each mounted {{division}} of about 3,500 troopers, {{consisted of three}} brigades, each brigade being made up of three regiments. Five of the six brigades of the 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions, most of which had recently arrived from France, consisted of one British yeomanry regiment and two British Indian Army cavalry regiments, {{one of which was}} usually lancers, including the Indian Princely States' 15th Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade of three lancer regiments. Some of the cavalry regiments <b>were</b> <b>armed</b> in addition to their Lee–Enfield rifles, bayonets and swords, with lances.

The mounted divisions were supported by machine gun squadrons, three artillery batteries from the Royal Horse Artillery or the Honourable Artillery Company, and light armoured car units—two Light Armoured Motor Batteries, and two Light Car Patrols.|$|E
5|$|For hand weapons, most Roman foot {{carried a}} thrusting-spear (hasta) and a sword (spatha). Among the Alamanni, spears were the {{universal}} weapon, swords were probably less common. Nobles (optimates) {{and the professional}} warrior-retainers of ringgivers certainly had them. For the lower ranks the position is not certain. Ammianus' report on the battle implies that many in the Alamanni ranks carried swords. Those that did not <b>were</b> <b>armed</b> with a seax (long pointed Germanic knives with some types being shortswords) {{as well as a}} spear and/or battle axe.|$|E
50|$|The tower itself <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> with a 24-pounder gun and two 24-pounder short guns. In {{front of}} the tower there was a paved redoubt that <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> with three 24-pounder guns.|$|R

The paramilitaries <b>were</b> <b>armed</b> by the Serbian police directly, or the SAO Krajina-aligned local militia under the approval of Serbian officials. By the end of April 1991, the White Eagles in Borovo Selo were joined by Dušan Silni paramilitaries, who were linked to the Serbian National Renewal party.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} Camillan system of {{organisation}} of the 3rd and 4th centuries BC, men were sorted into classes based on wealth, the principes being the wealthiest after the triarii. Principes <b>were</b> <b>armed</b> with short spears, or hastae, up to 1.8metres (6ft) long. They fought in a quincunx formation, usually carrying scuta, large rectangular shields, and bronze helmets, {{often with a}} number of feathers fixed onto the top to increase stature. They wore heavier armour types, the most common form being chainmail, which offered a good degree of protection without hindering movement.|$|E
2500|$|Ranger <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> {{with six}} 40mm quadruple mounts and forty-six 20mm mounts. She also <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> with eight /25 caliber guns, which were removed in June 1944.

5|$|In the end, {{despite all}} the efforts, most Home Army forces had {{inadequate}} weaponry. In 1944, when the Home Army was at its peak strength (200,000–600,000, according to various estimates), the Home Army had enough weaponry for only some 32,000 soldiers. On 1 August 1944, when the Warsaw Uprising began, only a sixth of Home Army fighters in Warsaw <b>were</b> <b>armed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Misch was {{transferred}} to the FBK in early May 1940. As a junior member of Hitler's permanent bodyguard, Misch travelled with Hitler throughout the war. When not serving as bodyguards, Misch and the others in the unit served as telephone operators, couriers, orderlies, valets, and waiters. When on duty, the FBK members were the only armed men Hitler allowed to be near him. They never had to surrender their weapon and were never searched when they were with Hitler. It did cause Misch some concern that they <b>were</b> <b>armed</b> only with Walther PPK 7.65 pistols.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after 8:00pm, Colonel Peters ordered three {{companies}} of 120 {{men of the}} 6th to move as commanded by the governor and General Herbert to Camden Station.

The troops returned fire, with live ammunition as they were equipped, and the frightened crowd retreated west across Fayette Street Bridge.|$|E
25|$|Type 209 {{submarines}} <b>are</b> <b>armed</b> with 8 bow 533mm torpedo {{tubes and}} 14 torpedoes.

Baris Presi is common throughout {{northern and southern}} Bali. Baris Dadap, however, was limited in range by the 1980s. Dancers are not accompanied by an orchestra, but sing songs regarding wayang during performances; this dance is generally performed during cremation ceremonies or temple festivals (dewayadnya).|$|R
5|$|The Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, {{set up by}} {{the king}} to report on the events of February and March, did not see any {{evidence}} to support the government's claim that protesters <b>were</b> <b>armed</b> or that medics had supplied them with weapons, however it stated that medics took control of the first floor of Salmaniya hospital. Eyewitnesses also denied being warned by the police, saying that if they had known of the police presence then women and children would have been evacuated.|$|E
5|$|The Bayern-class battleships <b>were</b> <b>armed</b> with a {{main battery}} of eight 38cm (15in) SK L/45 guns in four Drh LC/1913 twin gun turrets. These turrets could train 150degrees {{to either side}} of the centerline, and their guns could depress to −8degrees. As the Germans thought that {{conditions}} in the North Sea would dictate short-range actions, the guns initially could elevate only to 16degrees, which allowed a maximum range of 20,400m. The gun mountings were modified to allow elevation up to 20degrees, increasing the range to 23,200m.|$|E
5|$|The British {{correctly}} {{estimated the}} German strength as 250 aircraft. To meet the threat the Fighter Controllers at 11 Group's Uxbridge centre scrambled 13 Squadrons; No. 12 Group at Watnall passed on ordered to four more. Soon, a combined total of 47 Spitfires and 97 Hurricanes {{were in the}} air.

50|$|From the air, Soviet naval {{aviation}} had ASuW capabilities. The Tupolev Tu-16 Badger G <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> with anti-ship missiles, {{followed by}} the Tupolev Tu-22M Backfire supersonic maritime strike bomber. Even the prop-driven Tu-142, primarily designed for ASW warfare, could and <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> with antiship missiles.|$|R
50|$|The Type 093 <b>is</b> <b>armed</b> {{with six}} torpedo tubes; reports {{conflict}} on whether these are 553 mm or 650 mm tubes. The Type 093 {{has been said}} to <b>be</b> <b>armed</b> with the YJ-12 or YJ-82 anti-ship missiles. Anti-ship cruise missiles may also be future options.|$|R
50|$|San Diego County Probation firearm policy {{requires}} a OC Spray, which they provide. In 1988, San Diego County Probation {{was the first}} county to <b>be</b> <b>armed.</b> Of the 58 counties in California, {{all but a few}} of the San Francisco bay area counties <b>are</b> <b>armed.</b>|$|R
5|$|The French army {{of around}} 69,000 {{consisted}} of 48,000 infantry, 14,000 cavalry, and 7,000 artillery with 250 guns. Napoleon had used conscription {{to fill the}} ranks of the French army throughout his rule, but he did not conscript men for the 1815 campaign. His troops were mainly veterans with considerable experience and a fierce devotion to their Emperor. The cavalry in particular was both numerous and formidable, and included fourteen regiments of armoured heavy cavalry, and seven of highly versatile lancers who <b>were</b> <b>armed</b> with lances, sabres and firearms.|$|E
5|$|The Kentish {{advance on}} London {{appears to have}} been coordinated with the {{movement}} of the rebels in Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk. Their forces <b>were</b> <b>armed</b> with weapons including sticks, battle axes, old swords and bows. Along their way, they encountered Lady Joan, the King's mother, who was travelling back to the capital to avoid being caught up in the revolt; she was mocked but otherwise left unharmed. The Kentish rebels reached Blackheath, just south-east of the capital, on 12 June.|$|E
5|$|The Kolberg class {{represented}} {{the first major}} improvement in combat power for German light cruisers, both qualitatively and quantitatively. They <b>were</b> <b>armed</b> with the longer-barrel 10.5 cm SK L/45 gun, which had a higher muzzle velocity and thus greater range than the earlier L/40 weapon. In addition, they carried an extra pair of guns, which strengthened their broadside. This was on a displacement of over a thousand tons greater than the preceding Dresden class. All four ships were also powered by turbines, which granted them {{a significant increase in}} speed over the earlier vessels.|$|E
50|$|Type 209 {{submarines}} <b>are</b> <b>armed</b> with 8 bow 533 mm torpedo {{tubes and}} 14 torpedoes.
