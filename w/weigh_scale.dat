50|$|As earlier stated, flow {{instruments}} that function with the separator in an {{oil and gas}} environment include the flow indicator, flow transmitter and the flow controller. Due to maintenance (which will be discussed later) or due to high usage, these flowmeters do need to be calibrated from time to time. Calibration {{can be defined as}} the process of referencing signals of known quantity that has been predetermined to suit the range of measurements required. Calibration can also be seen from a mathematical point of view in which the flowmeters are standardized by determining the deviation from the predetermined standard so as to ascertain the proper correction factors. In determining the deviation from the predetermined standard, the actual flowrate is usually first determined {{with the use of a}} master meter which is a type of flowmeter that has been calibrated with a high degree of accuracy or by weighing the flow so as to be able to obtain a gravimetric reading of the mass flow. Another type of meter used is the transfer meter. However, according to Ting et al (1989), transfer meters have been proven to be less accurate if the operating conditions are different from its original calibrated points. According to Yoder (2000), the types of flowmeters used as master meters include turbine meters, positive displacement meters, venturi meters, and Coriolis meters. In the U.S., master meters are often calibrated at a flow lab that has been certified by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, (NIST). NIST certification of a flowmeter lab means that its methods have been approved by NIST. Normally, this includes NIST traceability, meaning that the standards used in the flowmeter calibration process have been certified by NIST or are causally linked back to standards that have been approved by NIST. However, there is a general belief in the industry that the second method which involves the gravimetric weighing of the amount of fluid (liquid or gas) that actually flows through the meter into or out of a container during the calibration procedure is the most ideal method for measuring the actual amount of flow. Apparently, the weighing scale used for this method also has to be traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as well.In ascertaining a proper correction factor, there is often no simple hardware adjustment to make the flowmeter start reading correctly. Instead, the deviation from the correct reading is recorded at a variety of flowrates. The data points are plotted, comparing the flowmeter output to the actual flowrate as determined by the standardized National Institute of Standards and Technology master meter or <b>weigh</b> <b>scale.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: The direct {{anchorage}} of lower-limb prosthesis to {{the bone}} {{has been shown to}} be an excellent alternative for amputees experiencing complications in using a conventional prosthetic socket. During rehabilitation phase, amputees are asked to apply static loading on the abutment perpendicular to a <b>weigh</b> <b>scale</b> to prepare the bone to tolerate the forces likely to be developed during walking. The <b>weigh</b> <b>scale</b> measures only the vertical force. A different loading protocol can affect the bone-implant interface stresses and the outcome of the rehabilitation. Methods: This study developed a Finite Element model to study the stresses in the bone adjacent to the implant. Three loading conditions were applied based on the experimentally measured load: (1) vertical force applied along the long axis of the limb, corresponding to the load clinically prescribed in the weight bearing exercise; (2) loads applied on the three axes, corresponding to the "true" load measured simultaneously by a tri-axial load transducer during the same exercise; and (3) loads experienced during independent walking. Findings: The model revealed that the <b>weigh</b> <b>scale</b> might in fact be applying much higher and less uniform stresses on the bone than expected. During walking, high stress occurred at various locations of the implanted region, which was different from the patterns of stress distribution during weight bearing exercises. Interpretations: The difference in stress among three loading conditions implies that tri-axial load should be monitored during the weight bearing exercises and carefully prescribed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The Yield Monitor Test Facility’s {{performance}} {{under static}} grain flow was very good. First, the grain metering system accurately meters grain at varying flow rates to the {{clean grain elevator}} over the prescribed time interval. Second, the <b>weigh</b> <b>scale</b> system appears to be very accurate in measuring the accumulated mass flow in the system. However, grain stream dynamics, tank vibration, and load cell sensitivity confounds attempts to measure instantaneous grain flow at low rates of 1 to 4 kg/s. Third, the commercially available yield monitor flow sensor demonstrated excellent accuracy across {{a wide range of}} static flow rates from 1. 3 to 21. 1 kg/s. Percent differences in accumulated mass flow for the yield monitor and the <b>weigh</b> <b>scale</b> were less than 1 % at calibration flow rates and approximately 3 % for extreme flow rates. Instantaneous mass flow rate variation was observed to be approximately 8 % at the mean calibration flow rate...|$|E

For example, student understanding that the forward rate instantaneously increases due {{to the increase in}} the concentration of reactants appears to have been fostered by interaction with the simulation. Analyses of students’ worksheet drawings after interaction with the simulation also revealed changes in patterns in how the motion, distribution, and ratio of molecules during equilibrium are perceived.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel methodology based on semistatic nondestructive testing of fish for the analytical computation of its textural characteristics via closed-form mathematical expressions. The novelty is that, unlike alternatives, explicit values for both stiffness and viscoelastic textural attributes may be computed, even if fish of different size/weight are tested. Furthermore, {{the testing procedure}} may be adapted to the specifications (sampling rate and accuracy) of the available equipment. The experimental testing involves a fish placed on the pan of a digital <b>weigh</b> <b>scale,</b> which is subsequently tested with a ramp-like load profile in a custom-made installation. The ramp slope is (to some extent) adjustable {{according to the specification}} (sampling rate and accuracy) of the equipment. The scale’s reaction to fish loading, namely, the reactive force, is collected throughout time and is shown to depend on the fish textural attributes according to a closed-form mathematical formula. The latter is subsequently used along with collected data in order to compute these attributes rapidly and effectively. Four whole raw sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) of various sizes and textures were tested. Changes in texture, related to different viscoelastic characteristics among the four fish, were correctly detected and quantified using the proposed methodology...|$|E

The gilts were housed in 12 pens, 16 gilts/pen providing a space allowance of 0. 82 m 2 /gilt. Gilts were weighed every 2 -wks for a maximum of eight scores/ gilt. Gilts were scored while on the <b>weigh</b> <b>scale</b> for activity using a whole number scale of one to five (1 = calm, minimal movement; 5 = continuous rapid movement and an escape attempt) at two different time points, T = 0 (as soon as the back gate was closed and T = 15, 15 sec after the back gate was closed. Analyses were done using Proc Mixed of SAS. The differences during round one between T = 0 and T = 15 was 1 point on the 5 point scale. By round eight this had dropped down to a difference of 0. 2. During the first round over both time points the gilts scored on average 2. 5, by round 5 this had dropped down to around 1. 5 at which point it stabilized.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of selection for reduced feed intake (RFI) on scale activity for Yorkshire gilts. A total of 192 Yorkshire gilts were used, 96 were from a line that had been selected for low residual feed intake over 5 generations (LRFI) and 96 from a randomly bred control line (CRFI). Gilts were housed in 12 pens (16 gilts/pen; 0. 82 m 2 /gilt) containing 8 gilts from each line in a conventional grow-finish unit. Gilts were weighed every 2 -wks for a maximum of eight scores per gilt. Gilts were scored while on the <b>weigh</b> <b>scale</b> for activity using a whole number scale of one to five (1 = calm, minimal movement; 5 = continuous rapid movement and an escape attempt). Analyses were done using Proc Mixed of SAS. The LRFI line began with a lower scale activity score, but did not experience as great of a drop in their score as the CRFI gilts. The CRFI gilts scored lower by the end of the rounds compared to the LRFI gilts. In conclusion, selection for lower residual feed intake in purebred Yorkshires has a related effect on scale activity score but this relationship is complicated and thus warrants further research. Therefore, scale activity may not be an easy measure to be added to the list of already described traits in pigs as a factor which relates to selection for lower RFI...|$|E

To maintain a timber dues rate system that accurately reflects the economic value of timber {{and the final}} selling price of the manufactured product. Policy Effective January 1, 1998 non-weigh scale, lumber producing operators who assess timber dues on sales volumes of their products will be permitted to apply up to 15 % of their sales volume as ‘small sawlogs’, as per 81 (3) of the Timber Management Regulation (the ‘Regulation’). Dues on this volume will be assessed at the base rate. All other dues rates under s. 81 remain available. Provisions in the Regulation establish a timber dues system that attempts to reflect the true market value of timber. Such provisions recognize where the value of timber is low or {{the costs associated with}} its ’ harvest are high- socalled ‘marginal ’ timber. This system bases the assessment of dues on an operator’s <b>weigh</b> <b>scale</b> data. Non-weigh scale operators who have timber dues assessed on the volume of their forest product sales have not, to this point, been able to apply ‘small sawlog ’ dues rates to their dues assessment. This Directive applies only to coniferous timber permits which are subject to Schedule 3 of the Regulation that are issued on a non-competitive basis, produce lumber and assess timber dues based on their product sales volume.
