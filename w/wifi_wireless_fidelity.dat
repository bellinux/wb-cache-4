40|$|Pervasive {{devices such}} as mobile phones and PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) come with {{different}} wireless communication capabilities, for example, <b>WiFi</b> (<b>Wireless</b> <b>Fidelity),</b> Bluetooth, IrDA (Infrared), etc. In order for pervasive devices to interact with each other, {{they need to have}} matching (alike) communication capabilities, otherwise such heterogeneous devices {{would not be able to}} interact with each other.

The proposed system supports adaptation of wireless communication protocols through a proxy, which sits between a client and a server, and supports adaptation of wireless communication protocols. Its functionality involves intercepting a request made by a client with a different wireless communication capability (e. g. Bluetooth) from what the server has (e. g.

Nevertheless, this daily coexistence {{does not imply that}} they will be able to fully interoperate. Thus, my research work focuses on a specific roaming scenario which is formed by heterogeneous wireless access networks managed by different operators. Our main objective is to provide a seamless (for the mobile user) roaming architecture to enable network interoperability under a heterogeneous multi-operator wireless environment, all this without major changes in current wireless architectures. In this regard, we also aim at reducing the roaming signaling exchange caused by the authentication and authorization mechanisms in the network registration and session initiation process while providing robust network security. The results obtained through computer simulation indicated that the use of our approach reduces significantly the network registration and session initiation delay, hence outperforming the traditional Roaming-SIP method. We also confirmed that the wireless delay introduced by the VN increases considerably when increasing the traffic congestion level in the Visiting Networks. Thus, from the simulations results we can state that by reducing the signaling message exchange, and maintaining acceptable congestion levels in the wireless network, hence reducing the wireless transmission delay, we can improved the overall de-lay in both network registration and session initiaition proces...|$|E

40|$|An ever {{growing demand}} for ‘location based services’ and the {{unprecedented}} growth of wireless local area networks (WLAN) has, {{in the past few}} years, attracted the focus of the research community to investigate and develop accurate indoor geolocation systems. Performance of any geolocation system is based upon the reported distance error. The accuracy required varies from application to application. For example an accurate geolocation system is required to apprehend a rogue client (illegitimate connection) inside a building in a dense wireless environment. At present this is possible only through wireless radio frequency (RF) interception of signals. The received signal strength (RSS) of a signal can be used to report the position of a client by triangulation. The hostile indoor environment presents many challenges including multipath and wall attenuation that needs to be considered for determining accurate indoor location. In this thesis a novel method to reduce the variation in RSS values is demonstrated by exploiting the frequency diversity existing across multiple channels of devices equipped with the IEEE 802. 11 a/b/g <b>wifi</b> (<b>wireless</b> <b>fidelity)</b> standards. Absorption of the RF signal due to walls is observed and identified as one of the major factors that influence location estimation. RSS from different directions and within different environments is also studied. The processed RSS values are then applied to location estimation using a novel RSS threshold algorithm based upon a RF propagation model. The algorithm is designed based on the room dimensions where location sensors are placed. The algorithm’s main feature is to correctly identify the walls existing between the sensors and client. Correct determination of walls together with a data fusion process produces accurate location results. For a set of example locations, the algorithm gives an accuracy of 3 m for 75 % of the locations and in terms of mean location error, is shown to be 2. 16 m for 100 % of the locations. The reported accuracy is superior to the most accurate existing systems. The research trend for indoor geolocation has recently focused upon a ‘finger-printing’ technique, which is environment dependant and time consuming. The results achieved and presented in this thesis revive the use of simple propagation modelling for indoor geolocation applications. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

From the physical layer to the network layer, studies on VLC have gradually explored networking issues related to the design and maintenance of VLC networks.
