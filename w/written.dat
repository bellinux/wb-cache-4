40|$|The {{tenet of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the use of <b>writing</b> strategies in reducing <b>writing</b> apprehension and uncovering its effect on EFL students` <b>writing</b> achievement. It also attempts to explore associations between foreign language apprehension, <b>writing</b> achievement and <b>writing</b> strategies. The primary aims of the study were to explore the relationship between <b>writing</b> strategies that EFL university students employ and <b>writing</b> apprehension, relationship between <b>writing</b> strategies use and students` <b>writing</b> achievement, and differences between high and low <b>writing</b> anxiety in their <b>writing</b> strategy use. Data were drawn from 198 (68 males and 130 females) EFL-major university students. The participants were asked to respond to a <b>Writing</b> Anxiety Inventory (SLWAI; Second Language <b>Writing</b> Anxiety Inventory) (Cheng, 2004) and to complete a <b>Writing</b> Strategies Inventory (Petric & Czarl, 2003). Some interviews were also conducted with some students to explore salient effective <b>writing</b> strategies that they used and the difficulties they faced during <b>writing</b> composition. Correlation, t-test, and ANOVA analyses were used to determine relationships between <b>writing</b> strategies and <b>writing</b> achievement and between students of high and low anxiety. The results of the study calls into question the common assumption that some of the Saudi undergraduates’ <b>writing</b> apprehension is pertinent to <b>writing</b> achievement. The results indicated that students with low <b>writing</b> anxiety were more users of <b>writing</b> strategies than the high anxious ones. Moreover, a significant negative correlation was found between students’ <b>writing</b> apprehension and their <b>writing</b> achievement...|$|R
40|$|<b>Writing</b> {{has been}} called the "neglected `R'" in the {{traditional}} trilogy of reading, `riting, and `rithmetic (National Commission on <b>Writing,</b> 2003). <b>Writing</b> performance continues to languish, despite societal expectations that students should be able to <b>write</b> clearly and precisely. Sociocognitive theory predicts that <b>writing</b> beliefs are related to <b>writing</b> performance. Much research has focused on <b>writing</b> self-efficacy beliefs and their link to <b>writing</b> apprehension and <b>writing</b> performance, while research exploring another type of belief, domain-specific beliefs about <b>writing</b> itself, is sparse. This study examined the relations between these beliefs about <b>writing,</b> <b>writing</b> self-efficacy, and <b>writing</b> apprehension, and their links to <b>writing</b> performance. 	This research was a three-phase study. Phases I and II involved instrument construction and validation, while Phase III examined the relations among the research variables. Two hundred eighty-seven Hispanic women students completed a test battery in class measuring demographics, beliefs about <b>writing,</b> <b>writing</b> self-efficacy, and <b>writing</b> apprehension. <b>Writing</b> performance was measured separately on an authentic <b>writing</b> task, a take-home paper, by both an overall grade and six component grades. Inter-rater agreements on these grades ranged from r =. 83 to. 91. 	Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that beliefs about <b>writing</b> independently predicted <b>writing</b> performance and that some beliefs about <b>writing</b> (e. g., Good writers adapt their message to their readers) are adaptive and associated with strong <b>writing</b> performance, while other beliefs about <b>writing</b> (e. g., Readers are impressed by big words) are maladaptive and relate to weak <b>writing</b> performance. In addition, apprehension about making grammatical and other mechanical errors had a stronger negative effect on <b>writing</b> performance than the more traditional concept of <b>writing</b> apprehension, which concerns sharing one's <b>writing</b> with others and having it critiqued. After controlling for domain-specific beliefs, <b>writing</b> self-efficacy weakly predicted <b>writing</b> performance as well. 	These results support the need for future research examining the relations among the research variables and <b>writing</b> performance in samples that are more balanced with respect to gender and ethnicity, and with other <b>writing</b> tasks. Because beliefs about <b>writing</b> demonstrated the largest beta weights in the regression equations, these beliefs may have the most promise for promoting both <b>writing</b> research and practice...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} relationships between college students’ <b>writing</b> achievement goal orientations, <b>writing</b> self-regulation, and <b>writing</b> grades. The {{study was conducted}} in a postsecondary setting at a large public university in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Using multivariate quantitative techniques (confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling), survey and <b>writing</b> sample data were gathered to address the following research questions: Do college students’ <b>writing</b> achievement goals relate to their <b>writing</b> grades; do college students’ <b>writing</b> achievement goals relate to their <b>writing</b> self-regulation; and, does <b>writing</b> self-regulation partially mediate the relationship between <b>writing</b> achievement goals and <b>writing</b> grades in college <b>writing</b> classrooms? A convenience sample of 107 participants completed both the survey and <b>writing</b> prompt portions of the study. Findings showed that all three <b>writing</b> achievement goal orientations tested (mastery, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance) were related to college students’ <b>writing</b> self-regulation. However, only <b>writing</b> performance-approach orientation was related to college students’ <b>writing</b> grades. Additionally, <b>writing</b> self-regualtion did not partially mediate the relationship between all three <b>writing</b> achievement goal orientations and <b>writing</b> grades as expected. <b>Writing</b> self-regulation did fully mediate the relationships between <b>writing</b> mastery and performance-avoidance goal orientations and <b>writing</b> grades, but failed to mediate the relationship between <b>writing</b> performance-approach goal orientation and <b>writing</b> grades. These findings contradict some of the prior literature on achievement goal orientations and self-regulation. However, these results help bridge a gap in the achievement goal orientation and self-regulation research, as prior studies have predominantly focused on PK- 12 settings and domains other than <b>writing</b> (reading, mathematics, science, etc.). The findings from this study are limited by the size and nature of the sample, and the survey items used. Future studies should attempt to gather further insight into the goals college students set for their <b>writing,</b> how those goals impact their self-regulation behaviors, and ultimately their <b>writing</b> grades...|$|R

The results indicate that more students who received Student-Centered <b>Writing</b> Instruction scored better on the post-test than those who received Teacher-Directed <b>Writing</b> Instruction.
