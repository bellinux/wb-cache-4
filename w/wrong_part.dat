5|$|Sir Tom Farmer {{took control}} of Hibs in 1991, but the club was still faced {{with the need to}} develop a stadium that would meet the {{requirements}} of the Taylor Report. Hibs entered talks with Edinburgh District Council about sharing a new stadium with Hearts, but the proposed site of Ingliston was in the <b>wrong</b> <b>part</b> of the city for Hibs. The club was more interested in the possibility of playing at Meadowbank Stadium, only a few hundred yards from Easter Road, but there were planning difficulties with adapting Meadowbank into a large football stadium. The reorganisation of the club after Farmer took control meant that there was no real pressure to move, as he also owned Easter Road. The Hibs board made an assessment, however, that the ground could not be renovated in a cost-effective fashion before the August 1994 deadline set by the Taylor Report. Hibs proposed in January 1992 to sell Easter Road and move to a site owned by Farmer in Straiton. Hibs also invited Hearts to share this stadium, as their proposal for a site in Millerhill had been rejected by planners. Those plans were scaled down in 1993 when Lothian Regional Council refused to allow the rest of the Straiton site to be used for commercial development. The Hibs board continued to back the Straiton proposal and they insisted the installation of bucket seats in the uncovered South Terrace was merely to comply with the Taylor Report deadline. This measure also reduced the capacity of Easter Road to 13,500.|$|E

High speed {{photography}} {{reveals that}} when a cat is unable to see its prey because it {{is too close to}} its mouth, its whiskers move so as to form a basket shape around its muzzle in order to precisely detect the prey's location. A cat whose whiskers have been damaged may bite the <b>wrong</b> <b>part</b> of its prey, indicating that they provide cats with detailed information about the shape and activity of its prey.|$|E

Two eggs were preserved {{just in front}} of and above the pubic boot, and several more may lie underneath them on the slab. It is unlikely that they were eaten by the animal, as they are in the <b>wrong</b> <b>part</b> of the body cavity for the egg shells to have remained intact. It is more likely that they are unlaid eggs produced by the animal itself. Each egg measured [...] long by [...] wide. The presence of two developed eggs suggests that Sinosauropteryx had dual oviducts and laid eggs in pairs, like other theropods.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the novel}} {{takes place in}} the 32nd century, the society within it is {{described}} as highly stagnant, even taking into account the spread of interstellar travel and cyborging. Often, however, the book suggests that those minor characters who repeatedly make this judgment are simply looking for symptoms of change and vitality in the <b>wrong</b> <b>parts</b> of society—a theme Nova shares with Alfred Bester's The Stars My Destination.|$|R
5000|$|One website reviews Franklin Mint {{vehicles}} {{and points out}} that though {{the lines of the}} 1:24 scale 1948 Tucker were [...] "clean and precise" [...] the model suffered from unrealistically thick hinges, window plastic 'glass' correctly detailed in some places but not in others, and a misplaced steering wheel and other problems with interior rendering (JSS Software 2012). Hemmings Motor News reported that the Franklin rendition of the Mercedes 300SL had accurate interior upholstery and nicely fitting gulling doors, but color details that were <b>wrong,</b> <b>parts</b> badly placed, and a misshapen windshield. (LaChance 2007).|$|R
500|$|This, however, meant {{there would}} be more riders packed into smaller trains, and led some {{passengers}} to miss trains because they were standing at the <b>wrong</b> <b>part</b> of the platform. In the past, there have been signs indicating where the train stops at some stations, in addition to the [...] "4" [...] and [...] "6" [...] markers next to the tracks used by train operators as stop points. Still, the overall lack of visual identifiers of train stop points on the platforms, the differing stop points during different times of day, and the location of staircases, transfer passageways and platform benches have been cited as a cause of passengers missing trains or being bunched into single cars. Beginning in 2013, additional signs were installed along G train platforms. In 2014, several improvements were implemented due to an infusion of extra funding, with G trains to be lengthened in 2019 (see below).|$|E
500|$|Villeneuve {{went into}} lap 48 {{less than a}} second behind Schumacher. Partway through the lap he {{attempted}} to overtake Schumacher at the Dry Sack corner. Braking later than Schumacher, Villeneuve held the inside line and was ahead on the track when Schumacher turned in on him resulting in a collision. ITV's then pit lane reporter James Allen has noted that onboard footage shows Schumacher twitching his steering wheel left before turning right into Villeneuve. Martin Brundle, in the commentary box alongside Murray Walker, immediately saw that Schumacher's move had been deliberate, saying, [...] "That didn't work Michael. You hit the <b>wrong</b> <b>part</b> of him, my friend". The right-front wheel of Schumacher's Ferrari hit the left radiator pod of Villeneuve's Williams—unlike the 1994 collision with Hill where Schumacher inflicted damage on Hill's suspension—and caused Schumacher to retire. Villeneuve described the incident after the race [...] "The car felt very strange. The hit was very hard. It was not a small thing." [...] He continued but the damage to his car meant he was slower than the cars behind him.|$|E

40|$|The {{shape of}} a target object could {{influence}} maximum grip aperture in human grasping movements in several different ways. Maximum grip aperture could {{be influenced by the}} required precision of digit placement, by the aim to avoid colliding with the <b>wrong</b> <b>parts</b> of the target objects, by the mass of the target objects, or by (mis) judging the width or the volume of the target objects. To examine the influence of these five factors, we asked subjects to grasp five differently shaped target objects with the same maximal width, height and depth and compared their maximum grip aperture with what one would expect for each of the five factors. The five target objects, a cube, a three-dimensional plus sign, a rectangular block, a cylinder and a sphere, were all grasped with the same final grip aperture. The experimentally observed maximum grip apertures correlated poorly with the maximum grip apertures that were expected {{on the basis of the}} required precision, the actual mass, the perceived width and the perceived volume. They correlated much better with the maximum grip apertures that were expected on the basis of avoiding unintended collisions with the target object. We propose that the influence of target object shape on maximum grip aperture might primarily be the result of the need to avoid colliding with the <b>wrong</b> <b>parts</b> of the target object...|$|R

Her husband John's leukaemia death {{serves as}} the basis for her friend's idea to {{purchase}} a sofa for hospital visitors in remembrance of him. Based on Angela Baker whose husband died from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1998, Walters was Cole's first choice to play the [...] "more quiet and sensitive" [...] role of Annie. Known for her comedic roles, Walters initially thought Cole had accidentally offered her the <b>wrong</b> <b>part,</b> and although pleased to have been cast against stereotype, she considered the role [...] "a difficult path to trap" [...] while striking a balance between Annie's grief and humorous moments. As a result, she was heavily involved in the modification of several scenes.|$|E
2500|$|After the war Poirot {{became a}} private detective and began {{undertaking}} civilian cases. He moved into what became both his home and work address, Flat 203 at 56B Whitehaven Mansions. Hastings first visits the flat when he returns to England in June 1935 from Argentina in The A.B.C. Murders, Chapter 1. The TV programmes place this in Florin Court, Charterhouse Square, in the <b>wrong</b> <b>part</b> of London. [...] According to Hastings, it was chosen by Poirot [...] "entirely on account of its strict geometrical appearance and proportion" [...] and described as the [...] "newest type of service flat". (The Florin Court building was actually built in 1936, decades after Poirot fictionally moved in.) His first case in this period was [...] "The Affair at the Victory Ball", which allowed Poirot to enter high society and begin his career as {{a private detective}}.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{receiving}} in England {{the news}} of Le Verrier's June prediction, George Airy immediately recognized the similarity of Le Verrier's and Adams' solutions. Up until that moment, Adams' work had been {{little more than a}} curiosity, but independent confirmation from Le Verrier spurred Airy to organize a secret attempt to find the planet. At a July 1846 meeting of the Board of Visitors of the Greenwich Observatory, with Challis and Sir John Herschel present, Airy suggested that Challis urgently look for the planet with the Cambridge 11.25inch equatorial telescope, [...] "in the hope of rescuing the matter from a state which is ... almost desperate". [...] The search was begun by a laborious method on 29 July. Adams continued to work on the problem, providing the British team with six solutions in 1845 and 1846 [...] which sent Challis searching the <b>wrong</b> <b>part</b> of the sky. Only after the discovery of Neptune had been announced in Paris and Berlin did it become apparent that Neptune had been observed on August 8 and August 12 but because Challis lacked an up-to-date star-map, it was not recognized as a planet.|$|E
40|$|Motivation: The {{alignment}} of biological sequences obtained from an algorithm will in general contain both correct and <b>wrong</b> <b>parts.</b> Hence, {{to allow for}} a valid interpretation of the alignment, the local trustworthiness of the alignment has to be quantied. Results: We present a novel approach that attributes a reliability index to every pair, including gapped regions, in the optimal {{alignment of}} two protein sequences. The method is based on a fuzzy recast of the dynamic programming algorithm for sequence alignment in terms of mean eld annealing. An extensive evaluation with structural reference alignments not only shows that the probability for a pair to be correctly aligned grows consistently with increasing reliability index, but moreover demonstrates that the value of the reliability index can directly be translated into an estimate of the probability for a correct alignment.

I very well knew that men are commonly more ashamed of natural imperfections than those which, in a great measure, depend on themselves; but then men are, in their own estimation at least, placed by nature at the head of creation, and in that capacity it is reasonable to suppose they will be jealous of their natural privileges. The present case was rather Leaplow than generic; and I could only account for it, by supposing that nature had placed certain nerves in the <b>wrong</b> <b>part</b> of the Leaplow anatomy.|$|E

50|$|Malcolm Klein and Cheryl Maxson {{examine the}} {{different}} patterns in characteristics of street gangs (specifically in America) and review many major gang-control programs seen around the world. In particular, {{he focuses on}} the distribution and expansion of gangs, patterns of gang crime, and how gangs are structured and organized. Going into a more individualized level, Klein and Maxson analyze risk factors and reasons why people want to join gangs (especially in the youth population) in five different realms: individual, family, peer, school, and neighborhood. He also brings in community influences to further understand how gang develops and functions inside those communities. Lastly, Klein and Maxson provide their insights on gang prevention and intervention programs in the United States. They claim that current existing gang control methods are not only ineffective, but also are confronting the <b>wrong</b> <b>parts</b> of a gang. To deal with this, they provide a list of guidelines and goals that gang prevention and intervention programs are recommended to follow {{in order to control}} gangs more successfully.|$|R
