5|$|The {{nematode}} worm Caenorhabditis elegans, like Drosophila, {{has been}} studied largely because of its importance in genetics. In the early 1970s, Sydney Brenner chose it as a model organism for studying the way that genes control development. One {{of the advantages of}} working with this worm is that the body plan is very stereotyped: the nervous system of the hermaphrodite contains exactly 302 neurons, always in the same places, making identical synaptic connections in every worm. Brenner's team sliced worms into thousands of ultrathin sections and photographed each one under an electron microscope, then visually matched fibers from section to section, to map out every neuron and synapse in the entire body. The complete neuronal <b>wiring</b> <b>diagram</b> of C.elegans – its connectome was achieved. Nothing approaching this level of detail is available for any other organism, and the information gained has enabled a multitude of studies that would otherwise have not been possible.|$|E

40|$|This {{monograph}} is {{a comprehensive}} study of the combinatorial structure of various operads of <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams</b> and undirected <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams.</b> Our first main objective is to prove a finite presentation theorem for each operad of <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams,</b> describing each one in terms {{of just a few}} operadic generators and a small number of generating relations. For example, the operad of <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams</b> has 8 generators and 28 generating relations, while the operad of undirected <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams</b> has 6 generators and 17 generating relations. Our second main objective is to prove a corresponding finite presentation theorem for algebras over each operad of <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams.</b> As applications we provide finite presentations for the propagator algebra, the algebra of discrete systems, the algebra of open dynamical systems, and the (typed) relational algebra. We also provide a partial verification of Spivak's conjecture regarding the quotient-freeness of the relational algebra. Our third main objective is to construct explicit operad maps among the several operads of <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams.</b> In particular, there is a surjective operad map from the operad of all <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams,</b> including delay nodes, to the operad of undirected <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams.</b> This monograph is intended for graduate students, mathematicians, scientists, and engineers interested in operads and <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams.</b> Assuming no prior knowledge of categories, operads, and <b>wiring</b> <b>diagrams,</b> this monograph is self-contained and {{can be used as a}} supplement in a graduate course and for independent study. There are over 100 graphical illustrations and a chapter with a list of problems. Comment: 302 pages. Substantially revised. New material includes: (i) a reading guide in the introduction of each of the three parts; (ii) a chapter summary at the end of each chapter from Ch. 2 to Ch. 13; (iii) new Ch. 15 on Further Reading; (iv) 30 new examples, 36 new pictures, and 27 new paragraphs of motivatio...|$|R

40|$|<b>Wiring</b> <b>diagrams,</b> as seen {{in digital}} circuits, can be nested hierarchically and thus have an aspect of self-similarity.
