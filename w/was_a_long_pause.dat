60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> {{during which}} the {{carriage}} rolled by rock and woodland.|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause.</b> 'She {{was very}} sorry about it,' said Charlotte gently.|$|E
60|$|Stephen {{caught his}} breath. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause</b> {{no one cared}} to start the bidding.|$|E
50|$|Sick sinus syndrome, a sinus node dysfunction, causing {{alternating}} bradycardia and tachycardia. Often there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause</b> asystole between heartbeat.|$|R
50|$|After she {{has left}} there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause.</b> The {{audience}} then hears the sound of two curtains being drawn evocative of those around a hospital bed.|$|R
60|$|There had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> during which, no doubt, Chauvelin {{satisfied}} the men {{as to his}} identity, for presently, questions and answers followed each other in quick succession.|$|R
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> {{and every}} {{man at the}} table meditated in ways unwonted and profound.|$|E
60|$|Lydia looked around, {{as if for}} a {{means of}} escape. Cashel waited anxiously. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause.</b>|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> and MacIan also {{lifted his}} large limbs off the ground--his eyes {{particularly}} dreamy.|$|E
6000|$|... "There isn't wind {{enough to}} bring her this way very fast," [...] he said after what seemed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause.</b> [...] "We've got time to start all the signals in good shape. Pick up the axes an' we'll {{see what kind of}} flares fifteen or twenty gallons of alcohol will make." ...|$|R
6000|$|CRICHTON (she {{clings to}} him, but {{though it is}} his death {{sentence}} he loosens her hold). Bill Crichton has got to play the game. (He pulls the levers. Soon through the window one of the beacons is seen flaring red. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause.</b> Shouting <b>is</b> heard. ERNEST {{is the first to}} arrive.) ...|$|R
60|$|At {{last the}} king stopped his pacing {{and faced the}} old man, though he could not meet those eagle eyes squarely, try as he would. It was his {{inability}} to do so, possibly, that added to his anger. Weak himself, he feared this strong man and envied him his strength, which, in <b>a</b> weak nature, <b>is</b> but <b>a</b> step from hatred. There evidently had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause</b> in their conversation, yet the king's next words took up the thread of their argument where it had broken.|$|R
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause.</b> Lilly {{stood at}} the window looking at the darkening market, beneath the street-lamps.|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> whilst Hermione {{looked at}} him for a long time, from under her heavy, drugged eyelids.|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> {{during which}} Mr. Mott, taking his niece gently by the arm, {{assisted}} {{her to a}} chair.|$|E
5000|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> silent <b>pause</b> and Tim {{looked at}} Gladding. He had {{suffered}} a heart attack and was dead in the studio chair. (This was {{believed to be the first}} time in the history of world radio that this had ever happened) ...|$|R
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> deep <b>pause.</b> Every {{one looked}} at the prisoner. Guy Waring stood like one stunned by the immensity of the blow. It <b>was</b> <b>an</b> awful moment. He knew he was innocent; but he knew now the English law would hang him.|$|R
6000|$|There had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> pretty <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> after <b>a</b> rather {{favourable}} {{commentary on}} the character of Barret, when the thin little old lady had wound up with the observation that the subject of their criticism <b>was</b> <b>a</b> remarkably agreeable man, with a playfully humorous and a delightfully serious turn of mind--"and so modest" [...] withal! ...|$|R
6000|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause</b> while victory {{hung in the}} balance. A white-haired old sinner, {{standing}} on one uneasy leg, piped up: ...|$|E
60|$|Here <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> the baronet evidently {{turning over}} in his mind, what he had done, and what yet {{remained}} to do.|$|E
6000|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> {{and then}} Francie emerged in fear {{from behind the}} press. Yes, it was Francie, but his curls were gone! ...|$|E
6000|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause,</b> <b>long</b> {{enough for}} this {{assurance}} to fall perfectly flat. Alice bit her lip. Then Lydia said, [...] "Do you know Mrs. Hoskyn?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What an {{excellent}} family arrangement," [...] said Lizzie. There <b>was</b> so <b>long</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> made between each statement {{that she was}} forced to make some reply.|$|R
6000|$|... "There <b>was</b> now <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause.</b> Having no commissariat train, Sir Eyre Coote {{was forced}} to make for the seashore, and, though hotly {{followed}} by Hyder, reached Cuddalore. A French fleet off the coast, however, prevented provisions being sent to him, and, even after the French had retired, the Madras government were so dilatory in forwarding supplies that the army was reduced to the verge of starvation.|$|R
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause.</b> Mrs. Radford readjusted {{the bacon}} in the Dutch oven. His heart beat fast, for fear he had {{offended}} her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'After a bit. I didn't quite {{understand}} at first {{what she was}} driving at.' There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause.</b> With an effort Harold went on: ...|$|E
6000|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause.</b> He {{listened to}} the static. Then a voice came, hard, thin, metallic. The same as the other. [...] "This is Leone." ...|$|E
6000|$|At that I {{made sure}} the man started, for I heard the blunderbuss rattle on the window-sill; and it <b>was</b> after quite <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> and with <b>a</b> curious change of voice, that the next {{question}} followed: ...|$|R
6000|$|JAYSON--[Clearing his throat.] Curt--[Before {{he starts}} what {{he intends to}} say, there {{is the sound of}} voices from the hall. ESTHER and LILY help in MRS. DAVIDSON to her former chair. The old lady's face is again {{transformed}} with joy. ESTHER joins EMILY on the couch. LILY sits in chair--front right. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> uncomfortable <b>pause</b> during which CURT paces up and down.] ...|$|R
50|$|Sick sinus {{syndrome}} {{may also}} be associated with tachycardias (fast heart rate) such as atrial tachycardia (PAT) and atrial fibrillation. Tachycardias that occur with sick sinus syndrome <b>are</b> characterized by <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause</b> after the tachycardia. Sick sinus syndrome is also associated with azygos continuation of interrupted inferior vena cava.|$|R
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause.</b> Then Aaron {{looked up}} into Lilly's face. It was dark and remote-seeming. It was like a Byzantine eikon at the moment.|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause,</b> {{during which}} there was no sound in the room except the ticking of the clock and the munching of shrimps by the ex-champion.|$|E
60|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause.</b> His {{voice had}} become hot and very sarcastic. Ursula was troubled and bewildered, {{they were both}} {{oblivious}} of everything but their own immersion.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the early}} 1960s, Mr. Sargent had an all-night radio program in Dallas that was {{sponsored}} by American Airlines. He would sign on every evening with the muted sound of an airliner's engines winding up and taking off into the night, followed by his verbal signature [...] "American Airlines greets you with 'Music [...] [...] [...]there would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause</b> [...] [...] [...] 'til Dawn". Then the theme song [...] "That's All" [...] would come on in the background while he made some introductory remarks. Frequently, and often early in the program, he would respond to a [...] "request" [...] to spin the recording of the great rendition of [...] "For You" [...] that he recorded with Glen Gray and the Casa Loma Orchestra. [...] "I would gather stars/Out of the blue/For you, for you./I'd make a string of pearls/Out of the dew/For you, for you [...] [...] [...]" [...] And that last [...] "you" [...] would rise up and seemingly go {{over the top of}} a high mountain before settling gently back down on pitch. He had a smooth, high-ranging singing voice, and a very soothing speaking voice that was easy to fall asleep listening to.|$|R
5000|$|Ironically, {{following}} {{the appearance of}} the incident in the media, the next nights performance of The Visit completely sold out. Farmer was very reluctant to return to the stage, but was encouraged by Ratcliffe, and Farmer recounted the experience of the performance in her autobiography: [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> silent <b>pause</b> as I stood there, followed by the most thunderous applause of my career. audience swept the scandal under the rug with their ovation." [...] It was [...] "my finest and final performance. I knew I would never need to act onstage again. I felt satisfied and rewarded." ...|$|R
50|$|A third degree sinoatrial block {{looks very}} similar to a sinus arrest. However, <b>a</b> sinus arrest <b>is</b> caused by <b>a</b> failure to form impulses. A third degree block is caused by failure to conduct them. The rhythm is {{irregular}} and either normal or slow. It <b>is</b> followed by <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>pause</b> that <b>is</b> not <b>a</b> multiple of the P-R interval. The pause ends with a P wave, instead of a junctional escape beat the way a sinus arrest would.|$|R
