The cast were not given the opportunity to tour the Century 21 studios in Slough until all their work was finished and therefore had no visualisation of their characters during the recording itself. This was to the regret of Liz Morgan: [...] "We all said that we wished <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> the puppets before doing the dialogue, as it would have been helpful to have something physical to base the voices on. I knew that Destiny was French and that Rhapsody had to be frightfully 'Sloaney,' but that was about it." ...|$|E

He shares, [...] "it {{was the first time}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> a dictator fall in Latin America." [...] García Márquez began writing Autumn of the Patriarch (El otoño del patriarca) in 1968 and said it was finished in 1971; however, he continued to embellish the dictator novel until 1975 when it was published in Spain. According to García Márquez, the novel is a [...] "poem on the solitude of power" [...] as it follows the life of an eternal dictator known as the General. The novel is developed through a series of anecdotes related {{to the life of the}} General, which do not appear in chronological order. Although the exact location of the story is not pin-pointed in the novel, the imaginary country is situated somewhere in the Caribbean.|$|E

Historian Edward Pelham Brenton, writing in 1825, noted however that French hostility on this occasion was justified, commenting that [...] "in the then troubled state of Europe Childers and her captain had no business to be prying into the equipments at Brest within gunshot of the forts: if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> a French vessel of war running from the Needles to St Helens, and making observations, I suspect we should, at such a crisis, have taken the liberty to bring her to action." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{effect of}} being {{shuttled}} {{into and out}} of the homes of family members led to a feeling of not being wanted, which made Washington extremely shy as a youth. The only time he recalls feeling a sense of self-worth was when his great-grandmother on his father's side had the pair for a while. [...] According to Washington, she loved the boys but was extremely strict, domineering, and at times, physically abusive. [...] After his father remarried, the children moved back in with him and his new wife. Washington felt a sense of optimism for the first time, saying [...] "I thought it was our dream come true. All our lives <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> nice families on TV. Real ones. Now we were going to be a real family." [...] However, he again felt unwanted this time by his stepmother. As a small child, Washington said that he had no recollections of ever being hugged, and only felt close to his younger brother, Chris. Washington was a poor student who hated school throughout most of his childhood. He had to retake many of his classes in summer school to raise his grades. When he entered high school he played football merely so he could be around a close friend, and have someone to walk home with at night as he was terrified of walking home alone.|$|E

[...] Button then managed his tyres much better than his teammate {{in the early stages of}} the race, building a lead which he did not relinquish, and making it a hat-trick of victories. David Tremayne described it as [...] "as good a performance as anything <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> there from the likes of Ayrton Senna or Michael Schumacher", adding that it [...] "swept away final doubts about his ability after years of floundering in mediocre machinery". In Turkey, Button qualified second behind Vettel but a first-lap error from the German allowed him to take the lead and he held off the competition to take his fourth consecutive win. This meant he had won six out of season's first seven races; an achievement matched only by Alberto Ascari, Juan Manuel Fangio, Jim Clark and Michael Schumacher, who all went on to win the world title.|$|E
2500|$|Benjamin McKenzie portrays Ryan Atwood, {{a troubled}} {{teenager}} from Chino who {{is brought into}} the privileged community of Newport Beach, California after his mother, Dawn Atwood, throws him out of their family home.

Ryan slowly finds himself a place within his new materialistic society, and makes of the most of his situation by not only completing high school, but also continuing on to university. Casting director Patrick Rush found the role of Ryan Atwood particularly hard to cast and only invited Benjamin McKenzie to an audition after Fox had made them aware of the young actor after his unsuccessful audition for a UPN sitcom. Rush said, [...] "When Benjamin [...] came in, he wasn't physically what Josh had envisioned, but he inhabited the character unlike anyone <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen.</b> I think that the character of Ryan is a kid that always seems a little lost and has a sense of mystery and danger; Benjamin has all those qualities."
