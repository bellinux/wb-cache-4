5000|$|An uninformed {{observation}} about incentives {{could lead}} one {{to the conclusion that}} a jurisdiction or local community <b>with</b> <b>a</b> weak <b>business</b> and employment base tends to offer more favorable incentives than one <b>with</b> <b>a</b> strong <b>business</b> and employment base. Although this correlation exists in certain instances, {{it is by no means}} an accurate reflection in each case of the approach public bodies take in allocating incentives to private enterprises. [...] For instance, <b>a</b> state <b>with</b> <b>a</b> strong <b>business</b> and employment base can leverage its financial position to offer incentive packages to <b>a</b> certain <b>business</b> class as <b>a</b> way to participate in <b>an</b> emerging national <b>business</b> sector. Similarly, <b>a</b> municipality <b>with</b> <b>a</b> weak <b>business</b> and employment base can be reticent to offer economic development incentives because of financial and political consequences. A municipality fitting this profile, however, could be receptive to providing incentives based on new project taxes, not otherwise available to it, generated by the recipient.|$|R
5|$|Born in Spirit Lake, Iowa, Bedell {{was educated}} in Spirit Lake public schools. He {{graduated}} from Spirit Lake High School in 1939, where he earned spending money <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> {{in the midst}} of the Great Depression. His business involved braiding dog hairs around fishhooks, the result of which could be sold as fish flies. He began tying the fly-fishing lures in his bedroom, then he moved the business into his parents' basement. In time, he got space above a grocery store to continue the business full-time.|$|E
5|$|In February 1869 Smetana had {{the text}} {{translated}} into French, {{and sent the}} libretto and score to the Paris Opera <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> proposal for dividing the profits. The management of the Paris Opera did not respond. The opera was first performed outside its native land on 11 January 1871, when Eduard Nápravník, conductor of the Russian Imperial Opera, gave a performance at the Mariinsky Theatre in St Petersburg. The work attracted mediocre notices from the critics, one of whom compared the work unfavourably to the Offenbach genre. Smetana was hurt by this remark, which he felt downgraded his opera to operetta status, and was convinced that press hostility had been generated by a former adversary, the Russian composer Mily Balakirev. The pair had clashed some years earlier, over the Provisional Theatre's stagings of Glinka's A Life for the Tsar and Ruslan and Lyudmila. Smetana believed that Balakirev had used the Russian premiere of The Bartered Bride {{as a means of}} exacting revenge.|$|E

25|$|Gaskell {{was born}} in Latchford, a suburb of Warrington, the eldest of six children. The Gaskell family were {{prominent}} Dissenters. His father, also William, was a sailcloth manufacturer <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> on Buttermarket Street and also a Unitarian theology teacher; according to one source, his mother, Margaret Jackson, was a housemaid. He was tutored by a local minister, Joseph Saul. Barred as a non-conformist from attending Oxford or Cambridge, Gaskell studied at Glasgow University (1820–25), taking his BA and MA in 1825. He then trained for the Unitarian ministry at Manchester New College (1825–28), at that time located in York, where his tutors included Charles Wellbeloved and James Turner.|$|E
25|$|In October 1946, Stanley {{approached}} fur-dealer Cyril Ross, {{the common}} acquaintance from the Manchester train, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> proposition.

Stanley agreed to pursue the matter and also to get permission for floatation as a public company from the Capital Issues Committee. Stanley, somewhat prematurely, offered a directorship in J.Jones to Gibson who, owing to his position, turned it down. Ross had originally intended that Stanley would be remunerated by equity in the new company but he ultimately lost trust, largely because of the extortionate expenses that Stanley regularly claimed, and agreed only to a fee for the work.|$|E

Sim senior was a Justice of the Peace and a successful tailor <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> on Lothian Road; his wife had moved to Edinburgh as a teenager from Eigg, one of the Small Isles in the Hebrides, and at first spoke only Gaelic. Sim was educated at Bruntsfield Primary, James Gillespie's High School and George Heriot's School. He worked – probably part-time – in his father's shop and then for the men's outfitters Gieve's, displaying no talent for the retail trade. In 1918 he {{was admitted to the}} University of Edinburgh to study analytical chemistry, but was called up for army training.|$|E
25|$|Business routes are {{assigned}} to many old alignments of Interstate Highways, U.S. Highways, state highways and farm to market roads that have been bypassed. In addition to the numerical designation, a unique lettered suffix is assigned to each business route along the highway—for instance, Business Interstate Highway 40-D and Business Farm to Market Road 1960-A. (Not all routes start from A, and letters are sometimes skipped.) These letters are included on the sign in small print below the number. The sign specifications for business Interstate highways {{do not include the}} letter, but it has been added to many signs. Prior to 1991, business routes were assigned loop or spur numbers, but signed as business routes (<b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>BUSINESS</b> plate above the shield for the main route). In 1991, all the business routes were assigned official designations, and their former loop and spur numbers were eliminated.|$|E
25|$|Following World War II, Sonic founder Troy N. Smith Sr. {{returned}} to his hometown of Seminole, Oklahoma, where he became employed as a milkman. He decided to work delivering bread because bread was not as heavy as milk. Soon afterwards, Smith purchased the Cottage Cafe, a little diner in Shawnee, Oklahoma. Before long, he sold it and opened a fast food restaurant, Troy's Pan Full of Chicken, {{on the edge of}} town. In 1953, Smith went in <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>business</b> partner to purchase a five-acre parcel of land that had a log house and a walk-up root beer stand, already named the Top Hat. The two men continued with the operation of the root beer stand and converted the log house into a steak restaurant. After realizing that the stand was averaging $700 a week in the sale of root beer, hamburgers, and hot dogs, Smith decided to focus on the more-profitable root beer stand. He also bought out his business partner.|$|E
