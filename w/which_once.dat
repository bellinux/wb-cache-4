5|$|Jetman's only usable {{weapon in}} his laser. Weapon {{upgrades}} may also spawn around a map, <b>which</b> <b>once</b> picked up will give Jetman various upgrades to his weapon. Upgrades include as a wider fire spread, faster projectiles or higher damage. The player starts {{the game with}} three nuclear devices, <b>which</b> <b>once</b> used will eliminate all enemies from the screen. Jetman also {{has the ability to}} boost, which will temporarily make him move at a much faster speed, although boosts will need to recharge once they are depleted.|$|E
5|$|A few {{groups of}} {{unicellular}} eukaryotes have only vestigial mitochondria or derived structures: the microsporidians, metamonads, and archamoebae. These groups appear {{as the most}} primitive eukaryotes on phylogenetic trees constructed using rRNA information, <b>which</b> <b>once</b> suggested that they appeared before the origin of mitochondria. However, this is now known to be an artifact of long-branch attraction—they are derived groups and retain genes or organelles derived from mitochondria (e.g., mitosomes and hydrogenosomes).|$|E

5|$|Objects {{connected}} with death, in particular sarcophagi and cinerary urns, {{form the basis}} of much of current knowledge of the ancient Etruscan civilization and its art, <b>which</b> <b>once</b> competed with the culture of ancient Rome, but was eventually absorbed into it. The sarcophagi and the lids of the urns often incorporate a reclining image of the deceased. The reclining figures in some Etruscan funerary art are shown using the mano cornuta to protect the grave.|$|E

The Crown and Angel public house on the Berkshire bank depicted {{in many of the}} contemporary drawings of the bridge was demolished {{at the same time as}} the bridge; a Victorian estate cottage now stands its place.|$|E
5|$|As a song full of {{gospel and}} soulful influences, it allowed Mariah to really tear loose and show {{what she could}} do – which in reality was {{far more than the}} vocal {{gymnastics}} that seemed to comprise her reputation so far. From a deep rumble to a high wail, she covered five octaves wonderfully, as the power of the tune built. The backing vocals – <b>which</b> <b>once</b> again had those churchy harmonies – filled out the spare melody, as did the stately horns, which entered towards the end. The song was truly a vocal showcase for Mariah.|$|E

5|$|Following Burges's death, further {{areas of}} the castle were {{developed}} along the lines he had set by, amongst others, William Frame. This included extensive reconstruction of {{the walls of the}} original Roman fort. The Animal Wall, completed in the 1920s by the 4th Marquess, originally stood between the castle moat and the city and has nine sculptures by Thomas Nicholls, with a further six sculpted by Alexander Carrick in the 1930s. The Swiss bridge, <b>which</b> <b>once</b> crossed the moat to the pre-Raphaelite garden encompassed by the Animal Wall, was removed in the 1930s. The stables, which lie to the north, on the edge of Bute Park, were designed by Burges in 1868–69.|$|E
5|$|Former {{mines in}} Italy, the United States and Mexico, <b>which</b> <b>once</b> {{produced}} {{a large proportion}} of the world supply, have now been completely mined out or, in the case of Slovenia (Idrija) and Spain (Almadén), shut down due to the fall of the price of mercury. Nevada's McDermitt Mine, the last mercury mine in the United States, closed in 1992. The price of mercury has been highly volatile over the years and in 2006 was $650 per 76-pound (34.46kg) flask.|$|E
5|$|Honório Hermeto Carneiro Leão {{was born}} on 11 January 1801, in the freguesia (civil parish) of São Carlos do Jacuí, Minas Gerais, then a {{captaincy}} (later province) of the Portuguese colony of Brazil. Named after Saint Honorata, Honório Hermeto {{was the son of}} Antônio Neto Carneiro Leão and Joana Severina Augusta de Lemos. On his father's side, he was descended from Portugal's powerful Carneiro Leão clan, which had settled in Brazil in the 17th century. Antônio Neto, however, was much less prosperous than his relatives. An impoverished military officer in 1801, he held the rank of furriel (third sergeant). Advancement of his career was thwarted by his character flaws. Antônio Neto was hotheaded and had a strong personality <b>which</b> <b>once</b> led to his arrest for insubordination.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, {{redevelopment}} began {{over most}} of the area above the platforms. The new buildings were named Embankment Place, a postmodern office and shopping complex designed by Terry Farrell and Partners. This development led to the replacement of almost the whole of the 1906 roof. The rear two spans of this structure – immediately adjacent to the existing concourse roof – were retained as part of an enlarged waiting area. In addition the original retaining side walls of the station <b>which</b> <b>once</b> supported it remain in near complete condition. The works were completed in November 1990. Most of the Embankment Place complex is office space, with a selection of restaurants on the ground floor.|$|E

Various places have been {{suggested}} for the exact spot where Buraq was tethered, but for several centuries the preferred location has been the al-Buraq mosque, which is just inside the wall {{at the south end of}} the present Western Wall plaza. The mosque is located above an ancient passageway, <b>which</b> <b>once</b> came out through the long-sealed Barclay's Gate whose huge lintel is still visible directly below the Maghrebi gate.|$|E
