5|$|Upon Janet's {{formation}} {{east of the}} <b>Windward</b> Islands, the Weather Bureau {{office in}} San Juan, Puerto Rico advised small craft to remain in port and vessels {{in the path of}} the developing storm to exercise caution. After a reconnaissance flight reported much stronger winds than initially suggested, hurricane warnings were issued at 1600UTC on September22 for the entirety of the Lesser Antilles from Saint Lucia to Grenada, including Barbados. Storm warnings were issued for all islands in the <b>Windward</b> Islands from Saint Lucia south to Tobago, excluding St. Vincent and the Grenadines. All warnings in the <b>Windward</b> Antilles remained in effect until 1000UTC on September22. Shortly after warnings were lowered in the <b>Windward</b> Islands, storm warnings were issued for the ABC islands and the Paraguaná Peninsula of Venezuela at 0200UTC on September23. After Janet passed north of the islands, all storm warnings were lifted on the morning of September25. The Weather Bureau later warned interests in Jamaica, but did not issue any hurricane-related warnings for the island.|$|E
5|$|Bouyon is {{a fusion}} of Jing ping, Cadence-lypso and {{traditional}} dances namely bèlè, Quadrille, chanté mas and lapo kabwit, Mazurka, Zouk and other styles of Caribbean music, developed by a band called <b>Windward</b> Caribbean Kulture (later WCK).|$|E
5|$|On the <b>windward</b> {{side of the}} mountain, {{stream erosion}} driven by trade winds has {{accelerated}} erosion {{in a manner similar}} to that on older Kohala.|$|E
5|$|Orographic {{precipitation}} {{occurs on}} the <b>windward</b> side of mountains and {{is caused by}} the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the trade winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the <b>windward</b> side of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air (see katabatic wind) on the descending and generally warming, leeward side where a rain shadow is observed.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} tropical wave {{with very}} little deep convection left Africa on July 22. It crossed the Atlantic, with convection associated with its southern part passing over the <b>Windward</b> Islands on July 28 and crossing Central America on July 31.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} depression formed {{from a low}} level circulation on July 11, well {{to the east of}} the <b>Windward</b> Islands. It attained a maximum strength of 30mph (45km/h), with a pressure of , though vertical wind shear from a subtropical ridge to the north caused it to dissipate on July 12.|$|E
5|$|As {{a strong}} {{tropical}} wave, Chantal {{passed through the}} <b>Windward</b> Islands. The island of Martinique reported sustained winds of 39miles per hour (63km/h) with gusts to 56miles per hour (91km/h). On August16, lightning from the system killed two brothers in southern Trinidad. Also on the island, heavy rainfall caused flooding and road washouts.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Anna {{impacted}} Central America and the <b>Windward</b> Islands in July1961. The first {{tropical cyclone}} and first hurricane {{of the hurricane}} season, Anna developed on July20 from an easterly wave located in the Intertropical Convergence Zone(ITCZ) over the <b>Windward</b> Islands. Initially a tropical storm, it moved westward across the Caribbean Sea. Favorable environmental conditions allowed Anna to reach hurricane intensity late on July20. Early on the following day, the storm strengthened into a Category2 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Intensification continued, and later on July21, Anna became a major hurricane, upon reaching Category3 intensity. After attaining peak intensity on July22, the hurricane slightly weakened while brushing the northern coast of Honduras. Further weakening occurred; when Anna made landfall in landfall in Belize (then known as British Honduras) on July24, winds decreased to 80mph (130km/h). Anna rapidly weakened over land and dissipated later that day.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>Windward</b> Islands, {{lightning}} caused two indirect {{deaths in}} Trinidad. Chantal dropped light to moderate rainfall across its path, most significantly in Quintana Roo in Mexico where it caused widespread mudslides. Damage in Belize totaled $4million (2001USD; $ USD), {{due to the}} combined impact of high waves, moderate winds, and rainfall. Overall damage was minor.|$|E
5|$|Russell had {{not broken}} the French line and her {{opponent}} Témeraire {{got the better}} of her, knocking away a topmast and escaping to <b>windward</b> with Trajan and Eole. Russell then fired on several passing French ships before joining Leviathan in attacking the centre of the French line. Russell's boats also took the surrender of America, her crew boarding the vessel to make her a prize (although later replaced by men from Royal Sovereign). Royal Sovereign lost Admiral Graves to a serious wound and lost her opponent as well, as Terrible fell out of the line to <b>windward</b> and joined a growing collection of French ships forming a new line {{on the far side of}} the action. Villaret was leading this line in his flagship Montagne, which had escaped from Queen Charlotte, and it was Montagne which Royal Sovereign engaged next, pursuing her close to the new French line accompanied by Valiant, and beginning a long-range action.|$|E
5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm watch for Barbados, St. Vincent, and Saint Lucia on August15. The following day the watches were changed to warnings, since forecasters predicted that the system would reach tropical storm status. Additional watches and warnings were also issued {{for the rest of}} <b>Windward</b> Islands.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm {{watches and}} later {{warnings}} were issued for the <b>Windward</b> Islands {{as far north}} as Martinique on October 13. They were dropped over the subsequent two days as Joan passed through. Along the coast of South America, additional warnings were raised and later dropped as Joan paralleled the coast.|$|E
5|$|A {{second meeting}} {{occurred}} on 8 May, when Virginia came out while Monitor {{and four other}} Federal ships bombarded Confederate batteries at Sewell's Point. The Federal ships retired slowly to Fort Monroe, hoping to lure Virginia into the Roads. She did not follow, however, and after firing a gun to <b>windward</b> {{as a sign of}} contempt, anchored off Sewell's Point. Later when Confederate forces abandoned Norfolk on 11 May 1862, they were forced to destroy Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Agamemnon {{was part}} of Vice-Admiral Robert Calder's fleet {{cruising}} off Cape Finisterre on 22 July 1805, when the combined Franco-Spanish fleet from the West Indies was sighted to <b>windward.</b> The British ships formed into line of battle, with Agamemnon fifth in the line, and engaged Admiral Villeneuve's fleet in hazy conditions with light winds. Agamemnon had three men wounded in the Battle of Cape Finisterre, and lost her mizzen topmast and the foresail yard. By nightfall, Calder's fleet had become scattered, and he signalled for the action to be discontinued.|$|E
5|$|Bouyon (Boo-Yon) {{is a form}} {{of popular}} music of Dominica, also known as jump up music in Guadeloupe and Martinique. The best-known band in the genre is <b>Windward</b> Caribbean Kulture (WCK), who {{originated}} the style in 1988 by experimenting elements of kadans (or cadence-lypso), lapo kabwit drumming, the folk style jing-ping, and a quick-paced electronic drum pattern. From a language perspective, Bouyon draws on English and Dominican Creole French. More recently, deejays with raggamuffin-style vocals (bouyon-muffin) have moved to the fore, updating the sound for the New Generation.|$|E
5|$|Cora was {{an unusual}} cyclone, {{maintaining}} an unusually low latitude for the Atlantic in August at high speeds, similar to the tracks of Tropical Storm Alma in 1974 and Tropical Storm Fran in 1990. The hurricane was also upgraded into a hurricane based solely on satellite photography, {{the second time this}} occurred. Although it passed through the <b>Windward</b> Islands and the Lesser Antilles, only minor effects were reported. Cora was also responsible for altering weather conditions allowing for a takeoff of the historical flight of the Double Eagle II hot air balloon.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Emily brought {{heavy rains}} and strong winds in the <b>Windward</b> Islands on September21, leaving {{numerous}} homes damaged and severe {{losses in the}} banana industry. Losses throughout the islands amounted to $291,000. In the Dominican Republic, despite the storm's high intensity, relatively moderate damage occurred. Three people {{were killed by the}} storm and damages amounted to $30million. Unexpected intensification of the storm led to severe impact in Bermuda. The storm caused $50million in damages and injured 16 people.|$|E
5|$|Incoming recruit Darius Morris and two Division I recruit {{teammates}} led <b>Windward</b> High School to the California Division V state title. Darius Morris received MVP of Olympic League, CIF Division 5A Southern Section Player of Year, and CIF Division 5A State Player of Year. Also Darius {{was awarded}} a John Wooden High School Player of the Year Award, received by Jrue Holiday the year before and the likes of Jason Kapono and Tayshaun Prince in the past.|$|E
5|$|Jerry caused minimal damage as {{it moved}} through the <b>Windward</b> Islands and Lesser Antilles. A station at Martinique {{reported}} sustained one-minute winds of 44mph (72km/h) on October 8. The outer bands of Jerry delivered light rainfall to Grenada on October 8, but no damage was reported. Some downpours and high winds were reported. No ships reported tropical storm-force winds, though Barbados reported a minimum pressure of 1007 mb.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in {{domestic}} cricket, the Beaumont Cup had been renamed the Texaco Cup, and both {{it and the}} Shell Shield continued to feature at the Queen's Park Oval. The first one-day cricket matches had begun in the West Indies, and the Queen's Park Oval hosted its inaugural Gillette Cup match between Trinidad and Tobago and the <b>Windward</b> Islands in February 1976. Several of these games would be hosted at the ground each season.|$|E
5|$|The 1905 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season featured five known tropical cyclones, {{two of which}} made landfall in the United States. The first system was initially observed near the <b>Windward</b> Islands on September6. The last system to dissipate, the fourth storm, transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October11, while located well southeast of Newfoundland. These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. Between October5 and October10, {{the fourth and fifth}} system existed simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|The 1917 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season featured nine known tropical cyclones, four of which made landfall. The first system appeared on July6 {{east of the}} <b>Windward</b> Islands. After crossing the islands and traversing the Caribbean Sea, the storm struck Honduras, Belize, and Mexico, before dissipating on July14. After {{more than three weeks}} without tropical cyclogenesis, another tropical storm developed west of Bermuda. As the storm brushed eastern New England, four ships sank near Nantucket, causing 41fatalities. The same cyclone brought damaging winds to Nova Scotia before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on August10.|$|E
5|$|The cook {{let go of}} the line. We rowed {{around to}} see if we could not get a line from the chief engineer, and all this time, mind you, there were no shrieks, no groans, but silence, silence and silence, and then the Commodore sank. She lurched to <b>windward,</b> then swung afar back, righted and dove into the sea, and the rafts were {{suddenly}} swallowed by this frightful maw of the ocean. And then by the men on the ten-foot dingy were words said that were still not words—something far beyond words.|$|E
5|$|The final {{tropical}} cyclone of the 2010 season developed from a tropical wave that moved off Africa on October24. The wave pushed west, organizing into a tropical depression by 06:00UTC on October29 and into Tropical Storm Tomas six hours later while located {{a few hundred}} miles east of Barbados. The cyclone turned northwest after formation while continuing to intensify, moving over Barbados by 09:00UTC on October30 with winds of 70mph (110km/h); as such, Tomas became the latest storm in a calendar year to strike the <b>Windward</b> Islands. The system reached hurricane intensity three hours later, and by 20:00UTC, attained its peak winds of 100mph (160km/h) while moving across St. Lucia. After moving into the Caribbean, a sharp increase in wind shear and dry air entrainment caused Tomas to dramatically weaken, and the storm fell to a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on November3. Fluctuating atmospheric conditions allowed Tomas to strengthen and oscillate between a tropical storm and hurricane as it curved through the <b>Windward</b> Passage and into the Atlantic. By 00:00UTC on November8, the cyclone succumbed to an increasingly unfavorable regime and became an extra{{tropical cyclone}}. The storm rotated around a broader low in the western Atlantic before being absorbed by a larger extratropical low south of Newfoundland early on November11.|$|E
5|$|The wind enables this moderating effect. The <b>windward</b> {{side of a}} {{land mass}} {{experiences}} more moderation than the leeward side. In the Northern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is west-to-east, and western coasts tend to be milder than eastern coasts. This is seen in Eastern North America and Western Europe, where rough continental climates appear {{on the east coast}} on parallels with mild climates {{on the other side of}} the ocean. In the Southern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is east-to-west, and the eastern coasts are milder.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Eleven formed just {{southeast}} of Barbados on October 4. It traveled across the <b>Windward</b> Islands, {{and was named}} Tropical Storm Iris while south of Puerto Rico on October 5. Iris continued {{to the west and}} intensified. After passing just south of Jamaica, Iris reached Category4 hurricane strength, and made landfall near Monkey River Town, Belize on October 9 at Category4 strength, but weakened rapidly. It dissipated later that day.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Chantal {{developed}} from a tropical wave on August14 {{in the tropical}} Atlantic Ocean. It tracked rapidly westward for much of its duration, and after degenerating into a tropical wave it passed through the <b>Windward</b> Islands. Chantal reformed and reached a peak intensity of 70mph (110km/h) twice in the Caribbean Sea, and each time, wind shear and later land interaction prevented strengthening to hurricane status. On August21 Chantal moved ashore near the border of Mexico and Belize, and it dissipated the next day.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Jerry {{formed as}} a {{tropical}} depression from a tropical wave on October 6 near Barbados. The storm intensified into a tropical storm early the following day on October 7 while initially located under an environment of weak vertical wind shear. After reaching its peak of 50mph (80km/h), Jerry passed just south of Barbados late on October 7 and through the <b>Windward</b> Islands on October 8. Deterioration in organization occurred, and Jerry dissipated while moving rapidly westward well south of Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|Vanilla {{is grown}} on small patches of land {{both as a}} single crop {{as well as an}} inter crop. As it needs lot of water for growth, it is largely grown on the rainier <b>windward</b> side of the island. Initially, vanilla is planted next to small trees until its vines grow to some height, at which point it is cut down closer to the soil so that it spreads across the ground. It starts to flower when about three years old; the {{flowering}} period is from July to August.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} west coast of Africa near Dakar, Senegal on September7. Moving westward across the Atlantic Ocean, the wave spawned an area of convection three days later, which gradually organized. On September13, the wave moved through the <b>Windward</b> Islands, producing wind gusts of 50mph (85km/h) on Barbados. Later that day, it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression about 75mi (120km) west-northwest of Trinidad, based on ship and land reports. Though located in a climatologically unfavorable area, the depression intensified and continued to develop. A Hurricane Hunters flight on September14 indicated that the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Greta {{to the north of the}} Netherlands Antilles.|$|E
