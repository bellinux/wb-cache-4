25|$|Wolfgang was {{complaining}} of his eyes. I noticed {{his head was}} warm, that his cheeks were hot and very red, but that his hands were cold as ice. Moreover, his pulse was not right. So <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> some black powder and put him to bed. During the night he was rather restless {{and in the morning}} he still had the dry fever.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, Townsend lent {{his voice}} to {{characters}} in several episodes of the Adult Swim cartoon Metalocalypse (see Musician cameos in Metalocalypse for more). The original character design for Pickles the Drummer, one of the series' main characters, bore {{a striking resemblance to}} Townsend. The series' co-creator Brendon Small acknowledged the similarity, and altered the design before the series began. [...] "We made sure he didn't look like Devin Townsend. <b>We</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> the goatee and the dreadover so he wouldn't look like that." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{believe that}} we are doing a noble work," [...] said Northover warmly. [...] "It has {{continually}} struck us that there is no element in modern life that is more lamentable than the fact that the modern man has to seek all artistic existence in a sedentary state. If he wishes to float into fairyland, he reads a book; if he wishes to dash into the thick of battle, he reads a book; if he wishes to soar into heaven, he reads a book; if he wishes to slide down the banisters, he reads a book. <b>We</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> these visions, but <b>we</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> exercise at the same time, the necessity of leaping from wall to wall, of fighting strange gentlemen, of running down long streets from pursuers--all healthy and pleasant exercises. <b>We</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a glimpse of that great morning world of Robin Hood or the Knights Errant, when one great game was played under the splendid sky. <b>We</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> back his childhood, that godlike time when we can act stories, be our own heroes, and at the same instant dance and dream." ...|$|R
500|$|The group re-recorded {{the song}} for the Rio album {{a few months later}} at London's AIR Studios with {{producer}} Colin Thurston, who also recorded the hits [...] "Too Shy" [...] for Kajagoogoo, and [...] "I Want Candy" [...] for Bow Wow Wow. Andy Taylor remembers: [...] "He was a great organizer and arranger, <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> far more ideas and music than the track actually needed, and he was important in the process of whittling them down to the essential elements." [...] Thurston and the band decided to keep the demo's original electronic backing track and just re-record the other instruments and vocals.|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 2008–09 season, James finished second in NBA Defensive Player of the Year voting and made his first NBA All-Defensive Team, posting 23 chase-down blocks and a career-high 93 total blocks. He also became only the fourth postmerger player to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks in a single season. Behind his play and the acquisition of All-Star guard Mo Williams, Cleveland went a franchise record 66–16 and fell just one game short of matching the best home record in league history. With final averages of 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.2 blocks per game, James became the first Cavalier to win the MVP Award. Reflecting on James' performance for ESPN, John Hollinger later wrote, [...] "He's having what is arguably the greatest individual season in history, and it's time <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> his due for it." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 11, 2011, Down {{announced}} on their Facebook page that they [...] "demoed {{a brand new}} tune." [...] Down played at Download Festival on Saturday 11 June 2011. They played alongside System of a Down, Avenged Sevenfold and Alice Cooper. Rex did not tour with Down during their spring 2011 shows. Crowbar bassist Pat Bruders filled in for Rex during those shows. [...] "Rex is not gonna be with us," [...] said Keenan. [...] "He's got things he needs to deal with, and <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> an ultimatum and he's trying to work things out. We've got Pat (Bruders) from Crowbar playing bass, and he's ass-kickin' in the same way. He plays with his fingers—which is really cool; he's got the whole Geezer Butler thing going on." [...] When asked whether or not Brown was still considered {{a part of the}} band, Keenan was hopeful but hesitant: [...] "I don't know what to really say on that; he's not out of the band, but he's not playing with us live." [...] On June 22, 2011, Jimmy Bower announced that Rex Brown would not be returning to Down, and that Pat Bruders is his replacement.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2008 {{commentary}} on the INM plc AGM Shane Ross referred to O'Brien as [...] "an ordinary, likeable bloke... from a solid middle-class background" [...] but a [...] "little businessman" [...] and [...] "no star", and mocked his Malta residency, although not only was Chairman Tony O'Reilly a resident in an offshore tax haven (Bahamas) but 70% of CEO Gavin O'Reilly's remuneration was paid into an-off shore Jersey entity. [...] "Whatever {{the source of the}} obvious personal resentment which the man from Malta feels for Sir Anthony O'Reilly, this weekend let us show him some gratitude. He gave us shareholders a clear choice. In return <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> an unambiguous verdict. Vacate the pitch." [...] After Ross wrote the article the share price collapsed and the company was restructured, without attracting additional comment from Ross's column.|$|E
2500|$|During late-September, President Kennedy {{dispatched}} the McNamara Taylor {{mission to}} investigate the political and military situation in South Vietnam. This included investigating an ARVN coup. Minh {{expressed an interest in}} meeting McNamara and Taylor, so a game of doubles tennis was organized. McNamara watched on as Taylor played with Minh, giving [...] "broad hints of our interest in other subjects which <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> during breaks in the game". Minh revealed nothing of his thoughts about a possible coup, leaving his guests bewildered. Minh later messaged Taylor with a complaint about a perceived lack of support from Washington for a coup. Diệm became very unpopular during the Buddhist crisis of 1963; the U.S. informed the Vietnamese generals (through the CIA) that it would not object if Diệm were to be overthrown. Minh was the second highest ranking general at the time, and he led the coup to overthrow Diệm on 1 November 1963.|$|E
2500|$|The mission took a {{diversion}} into investigating a possible coup by ARVN officers when General Dương Văn Minh {{expressed an interest}} in meeting McNamara and Taylor, either alone or together. After an extensive series of discretionary arrangements were made, Taylor joined Minh in a game of doubles on the tennis court of the Saigon Officers Club. McNamara watched on as Taylor played with Minh, waiting anxiously for any signals from Minh to [...] "broad hints of our interest in other subjects which <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> during breaks in the game". Minh revealed nothing of his thoughts about a possible coup, leaving his guest bewildered to his intentions in inviting them. McNamara later grumbled to Kennedy that [...] "I sat on a sideline two feet from Big Minh for over an hour and I couldn't get a damn thing out of him." [...] Taylor got one of the tennis players, Colonel Raymond Jones, to contact Minh about the situation, to which Minh replied with a complaint about a perceived lack of support from Washington for a coup. Minh claimed that he thought McNamara and Taylor were seeking nothing but a match of tennis and offered to discuss military affairs at any time.|$|E

2500|$|Isaac is {{mentioned}} fifteen times by {{name in the}} Qur'an, often {{with his father and}} his son, Yaʿqūb (Jacob). The Qur'an states that Abraham received [...] "good tidings of Isaac, a prophet, of the righteous", and that God blessed them both (37: 12). [...] "And <b>We</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> glad tidings of Isaac, a prophet from among the righteous. And We blessed him and Isaac. And among their progeny are the virtuous and those who clearly wrong themselves" [...] In a fuller description, when angels came to Ibrahim to tell him of the future punishment to be imposed on Sodom and Gomorrah, his wife, Sarah, [...] "laughed, and We gave her good tidings of Isaac, and after Isaac of (a grandson) Jacob" [...] (11: 71-74); and it is further explained that this event will take place despite Abraham and Sarah's old age. Several verses speak of Isaac as a [...] "gift" [...] to Abraham (6: 84; 19: 49-50), and 29: 26-27 adds that God made [...] "prophethood and the Book to be among his offspring", which has been interpreted to refer to Abraham's two prophetic sons, his prophetic grandson Jacob, and his prophetic great-grandson Joseph. In the Qur'an, it later narrates that Abraham also praised God for giving him Ishmael and Isaac in his old age (XIV: 39-41).|$|E

And he was weak, most weak, like a little child, so that <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> a place by the fire, and warm furs to lie upon, and <b>we</b> <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> food as little children are given food.|$|E
