The special then premiered on Netflix on April 25, 2014 and the CD/DVD dropped on iTunes on Tuesday April 29, 2014. The brothers uniquely framed their special {{as if it}} were an NFL playoff game with Rich Eisen leading a roundtable discussion of {{the brothers}}' comedy on an NFL Network set, along with future Hall of Fame Defensive Lineman Dwight Freeney, NY Giant Defensive Back Terrell Thomas, and actor and former Georgia Bulldog football player Omar Dorsey. In addition the ubiquitous sideline reporter Bonnie Bernstein makes a cameo, interviewing the brothers pre- and post-show. The stand up special features a pre-game breakdown by this crew, a halftime report, and a post game wrap up. The stand up special titled <b>What</b> <b>Are</b> <b>We</b> <b>Talking</b> About will be available on Netflix instant streaming for three years after the April 25, 2014 premiere.|$|E

50|$|The {{brothers}} have done three stand up specials in their career. The first two stand-up specials were Comedy Central Presents half-hour stand-up specials that aired on Comedy Central in 2001 and in 2009. In April 2014, the brothers premiered <b>What</b> <b>Are</b> <b>We</b> <b>Talking</b> About, their first 1-hour stand up special on Netflix. The material was a culmination of {{material from the}} past couple of years, the 2011 album Hendersons and Daughters, and material written as close to 2 weeks before the special was recorded in Madison, Wisconsin at the Majestic Theater. In the Netflix special, the brothers employ a unique framing device where they treat their stand up special {{as if it were an}} NFL playoff game that gets broken down by NFL Network Anchor, Rich Eisen and current NFL players, Dwight Freeney and Terrell Thomas, along with actor, Omar Dorsey (who played football for the University of Georgia). Sideline reporter for the NFL, Bonnie Bernstein makes a cameo, interviewing the brothers pre- and post-show as well, lending a level of authenticity to the running sketch.|$|E
5000|$|Team America: World Police has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from critics. Based on 194 reviews, the film received a 77% approval rating at review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes. The consensus states, [...] "Team America will either offend you or leave you in stitches. It'll probably do both." [...] The film also holds {{a rating of}} 64 out of 100 at Metacritic based on 38 critics, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Thunderbirds creator Gerry Anderson {{was supposed to have}} met Parker before production, but they cancelled the meeting, acknowledging he would not like the film's expletives. Anderson saw the completed film and felt [...] "there are good, fun parts the film but the language wasn't to my liking." [...] National Review Online has named the film #24 in its list of [...] "The Best Conservative Movies". Brian C. Anderson wrote, [...] "the film's utter disgust with air-headed, left-wing celebrity activism remains unmatched in popular culture." [...] However, political and social commentator Andrew Sullivan considers the film brilliant in its skewering of both the left and right's approach on terrorism. Sullivan (a fan of Stone and Parker's other work, as well) popularized the term [...] "South Park Republican" [...] to describe himself and other like-minded fiscal conservatives/social libertarians. Parker himself is a registered Libertarian. In August, Internet news aggregator Matt Drudge blasted Paramount and the filmmakers for trying to [...] "mock the terror war." [...] A week later, the conservative group Move America Forward criticized the film, saying it was [...] "inconceivable" [...] that filmmakers would have spoofed the Nazis during World War II. In reality, many films mocking the Nazis were produced during the war, including Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator, which was nominated for five Academy Awards. Before Team America was released, statements were released by a [...] "senior Bush administration official" [...] condemning the film. Upon receiving the news, the duo called and found it was instead a [...] "junior staffer," [...] causing Stone to quip [...] "What is it - junior or senior? <b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>talking</b> about here? Who knows? It might have been the janitor." [...] The two eventually decided it was free publicity, with which they were fine. Some media outlets interpreted the film's release on October 15 to be in theaters before the November elections. In reality, the release date {{had nothing to do with}} the elections; in fact, the film was intended to be released earlier, but production fell behind. Director Quentin Tarantino counted Team America: World Police in his list of top 20 films released since 1992, when his career as a filmmaker began.|$|E

40|$|Bernard Lahire, Linguistics, Writing, Pedagogy : Pertinent Fields and Illegal Transferts For a long time, "writing" will {{be thought}} of by {{philosophers}} and linguists as being secondary in relation to "discourse". The paradox {{lies in the fact}} that the maligned "writing" is at the foundation of linguistic methods and theories. Saussurian linguistics, to take one of the most pure theories of language signs, always discusses a totality of written and graphic practices, and especially scholastic writing practices, without being aware of this fact Mikhaïl Bakhtine, who has developed the point rejects this theory too rapidly. If the pertinent field of Saussurian linguistics lies in the totality of scholastic writing practices, then this is not a false theory. Bakhtine is wrong to not see why Saussure is partially right. In this particular case, we can elucidate questions such as : <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>talking</b> about ? what is its pertinent field ? does it not speak of a particular category of social phenomena while it claims to speak of social phenomena in general ?Lahire Bernard.

40|$|Water being {{essential}} to human survival, a political economy directed to satisfying human basic needs, should be especially {{concerned with the}} issue of water availability and distribution. Why is there such inequality in its distribution? This inequality represents a serious violation of a human right, as it will be developed in the paper and therefore should not be tolerated. The issue this paper wishes to address concerns the role played by economics in the unequal assertion of every people’s human right to clean water. First of all, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>talking</b> about when we talk about economics? A rapid overview can identify at least twenty schools of economic thought, from neoclassic to evolutionary, from Marxist to post-Keynesian. If one had to be accurate, a paper on the impact of economics on the human right to water human rights would then have to be divided in at least twenty chapters.

40|$|<b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>talking</b> {{about when}} we merge knowledge, {{organizations}} and passion together? Although this may seem a somewhat eccentric question, it in fact highlights a very simple and everyday relation. We {{are talking about the}} importance of the expressive relation and attachment to the world and the limit of a purely instrumental and economic view of human activity: the idea that people do what they do for the love of what they do and not for the money. This relation requires brief historical contextualization. The oppositional and hierarchical relationship between emotion and rationality, with the latter term predominating over the former, is a relatively recent phenomenon. As noted by Elias (1994), the individual control and the public regulation of emotions are a central part of the process of modernization. The removal or deferral of emotions and passions from the public and organizational sphere can thus be fully identifi ed as one of the main features of the project of modernity. Things, however, used to be different. Many of the 17 th-century writers were concerned with the passions as a source of self-knowledge, self-control, and power over others; and they were moving away from the treatment of passions embedded in discussion of vice and virtue. Most of these works are not well-known today, even if they contributed to an early philosophy of mind (James, 1997). The 17 th century was marked by a growing spirit of inquiry ‘that moved from experience to generalization...|$|E
