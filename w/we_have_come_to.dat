25|$|Some {{view the}} three-age system as over-simple; that is, it neglects vital detail and forces complex {{circumstances}} into a mold {{they do not}} fit. Rowlands argues that the division of human societies into epochs based on the presumption of a single set of related changes is not realistic:But as a more rigorous sociological approach has begun to show that changes at the economic, political and ideological levels are not 'all of apiece' <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> realise that time may be segmented in as many ways as convenient to the researcher concerned.|$|E

This translation of the Dhammapada... is offered as a small contribution to world understanding. The central thesis of the book, that human conduct, righteous behaviour, reflection, and meditation are more important than vain speculations about the transcendent - has an appeal to the modern mind.... Books so rich in significance... require to be understood by each generation in relation to its own problems.|$|E
25|$|Oh, praised be {{the beauty}} of this earth; the beauty, and the bloom, and the mirthfulness thereof. We lived before, and shall live again; and as we hope for a fairer world than this to come; so we came from one less fine. From each {{successive}} world, the demon Principle is more and more dislodged; he is the accursed clog from chaos, and thither, by every new translation, we drive him further and further back again. Hosannahs to this world! so beautiful itself, and the vestibule to more.

The Partisan [...] was called upon to [...] "kill the political commissars and join our ranks right away," [...] like the [...] "hundreds and hundreds who are surrendering every day, conscious {{that they have been}} betrayed and swindled by the Communist Jews." ...|$|E
500|$|Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] {{was a great}} {{showcase}} for not only each of the characters, but the setting of Pawnee as well, and that the episode [...] "illustrated each part of Pawnee that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> know and love so much". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix had the [...] "both the scope and the out-of-control but not frantic style" [...] of [...] "The Harvest Festival". He also enjoyed the scene with Leslie and Ben, and said he believed the show could get great [...] "comic mileage" [...] out of their continued secret relationship together. Paste magazine writer Garrett Martin called the episode a [...] "tour de force that expertly wrapped up an excellent season". Garrett said the show's characters were [...] "so vivid and instantly memorable" [...] that the death of Li'l Sebastian really felt like a major event, {{even though he had}} only previously appeared in one other episode. Matt Fowler of IGN said [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] was hilarious and demonstrated [...] "how marvelously great this series is at creating a truly lovable ensemble". He also enjoyed seeing Tom succeed with his concert, and claimed the Li'l Sebastian funeral scene was surprisingly powerful.|$|E
500|$|Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two called the entry [...] "an {{exercise}} in futility [...] at best" [...] and argued that, because Duchovny had left the series, the sense of excitement {{that he might have}} made an appearance in the episode was completely gone. Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson heavily criticized Mulder and Scully's characterization, calling Mulder a character the audience [...] "can't recognize any more" [...] and Scully a [...] "gullible patsy". M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, was also critical of the script's treatment of the characters, arguing that Mulder and Scully in this episode [...] "sound nothing like the characters <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> know". He also lamented that the episode did not examine the central theme of electronic surveillance in greater detail. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, wrote a largely negative review of the episode. He derided the series for making it appear that Mulder abandoned the woman he loved and his own child. He noted, [...] "Just because it walks, talks, and sometimes acts like The X-Files, doesn't make it The X-Files." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode's humour {{was praised}} by the {{majority}} of commentators. Julia Raeside, writing for The Guardian, said the writers [...] "managed to pull together a loving tribute to [...] cult horror source material with an all-out gag rate that most sitcoms would fail to keep up with", claiming that [...] "they get the look and tone just right and then inject it with the kind of comedy that is perfectly tailored to puncture the fictional world without deflating it". Similarly, Debnath felt that the jokes, including [...] "anachronistic references" [...] and [...] "dark punnery", were [...] "bang on". By contrast, Hawksley claimed that the episode had several [...] "inspired moments", including a [...] "perfectly pitched" [...] joke about selfies, but that the writers had failed to properly exploit the 17th-century setting. Overall, though finding it [...] "occasionally funny", Hawksley thought the episode [...] "fell some way short of what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> expect from Pemberton and Shearsmith". For the comedy critic Bruce Dessau, the episode was [...] "all the more hauntingly funny because it is played pretty straight", but he noted that the character of Sir Andrew Pike allowed [...] "some offbeat humour". Chater called the episode [...] "very, very funny", and Philip Cunnington, of the Lancashire Evening Post, called it [...] "one of the funniest half-hours of TV so far this year" [...] after the conclusion of the series.|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said Boyle's [...] "electric" [...] {{direction}} [...] "temperamentally complements Sorkin's highly theatrical three-act study" [...] {{and praised}} Fassbender in the role, who [...] "doesn't closely physically resemble the man, [...] he fully delivers {{the essentials of}} how <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> perceive the man." [...] Justin Chang of Variety extolled the film as [...] "a wildly creative fantasia...a brilliant, maddening, ingeniously designed and monstrously self-aggrandizing movie." [...] Sasha Stone, writing for TheWrap, stated that Fassbender gives [...] "a stunning knockout" [...] performance as Jobs in a film that is [...] "a kind of talk opera", which to some {{might seem to be}} [...] "Sorkin overkill but {{the same could be said}} for the best of them: David Mamet, Edward Albee, Paddy Chayefsky and even William Shakespeare. Sorkin is not trying to do anything but write in his own style, thus this film and its exceptional dialogue leaves its mark as profoundly as Jobs himself left his." [...] Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film a [...] "B+", stating that [...] "the cast vanishes into their parts...buried under makeup and a distinctive Polish accent, Winslet's chameleonesque transformation is bested only by Fassbender, whose vivid expressions and constant movement turn him into a physical marvel." [...] He also noted that Boyle [...] "drops his usual whirlwind editing style and instead develops an engrossing chamber piece." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The World Is Not Enough" [...] {{received}} mainly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Kerrang! magazine noted that [...] "Nothing takes a band into the truly immortal like a Bond theme, and Garbage's ever-burgeoning celebrity {{will be done}} no harm whatsoever by this appropriately lush and orchestral anthem." [...] A Radio Times reviewer wrote that the song [...] "sounds like Shirley Bassey revisited", while AllMusic's Steve Thomas Erlewine wrote that Garbage [...] "expertly modernized the classic Bond sound, while turning in a strong melodic tune. A first class theme song". PopMatters called the song a [...] "top-notch Bond theme", following the Shirley Bassey template. In a Billboard review, Chuck Taylor wrote that Garbage was an inspired choice and the song [...] "rings of international intrigue, with the slinky gait, noir-ish guitar line and grand chorus <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> expect... the song's darkly sexy, electronic ambience is wholly in keeping with Garbage's distinctive soundprint. [...] not only the best 007 theme in eons, {{it is a great}} Garbage track that should thrill fans of band and Bond alike". IGN ranked [...] "The World Is Not Enough" [...] ninth on its list of top 10 James Bond songs: [...] "Shirley Manson's warbling croon is a perfect fit for an opening sequence and her bandmates gel well with Arnold's sweeping symphonics." ...|$|E
