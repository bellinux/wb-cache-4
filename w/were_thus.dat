60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> in sundry of {{the cases}} we have quoted as at {{variance}} with M. Comte's doctrine. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> with the application of Huyghens's optical discovery to astronomical observation by Galileo. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> with {{the application of the}} isochronism of the pendulum to the making of instruments for measuring intervals, astronomical and other. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> when the discovery that the refraction and dispersion of light did not follow the same law of variation, affected both astronomy and physiology by giving us achromatic telescopes and microscopes. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> when Bradley's discovery of the aberration of light enabled him to make the first step towards ascertaining the motions of the stars. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> when Cavendish's torsion-balance experiment determined the specific gravity of the earth, and so gave a datum for calculating the specific gravities of the sun and planets. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> when tables of atmospheric refraction enabled observers to write down the real places of the heavenly bodies instead of their apparent places. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> when the discovery of the different expansibilities of metals by heat, gave us the means of correcting our chronometrical measurements of astronomical periods. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> when the lines of the prismatic spectrum were used to distinguish the heavenly bodies that are of like nature with the sun from those which are not. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> when, as recently, an electro-telegraphic instrument was invented for the more accurate registration of meridional transits. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> when the difference in the rates of a clock at the equator, and nearer the poles, gave data for calculating the oblateness of the earth, and accounting for the precession of the equinoxes. It was thus--but it is needless to continue.|$|R
3000|$|... <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> {{determined}} by the propagation and not by the emitted source signals. The amplitude vector a is constant between realizations up to a multiplying factor. The P arrival amplitudes <b>are</b> <b>thus</b> fully correlated.|$|R

5|$|In the July 1932 election, the Nazis won 230 {{seats to}} become {{far and away}} the largest party in the Reichstag. By longstanding tradition, the Nazis <b>were</b> <b>thus</b> {{entitled}} to select the President of the Reichstag, and were able to elect Göring for the post.|$|E
5|$|Molotov and {{her sister}} Maxim Gorky had heavier armor and were {{slightly}} improved from the first two Kirov-class cruisers of Project 26, and <b>were</b> <b>thus</b> designated Project 26bis.|$|E
5|$|No {{surviving}} Greek texts written {{after the}} year 100 can be securely {{identified as having}} a Jewish author. After this time, Jewish writings in Greek became irrelevant to Christians, who <b>were</b> <b>thus</b> unlikely to preserve them. The manuscription tradition of medieval Jewish culture has preserved only writings in Hebrew and Aramaic.|$|E

5000|$|Chow mein {{was brought}} to Brazil by Japanese {{immigrants}} and <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> referred as yakisoba ( [...] or [...] ). It fits Brazilian tastes rather than Japanese ones though, and <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> more similar to the North American versions of chow mein.|$|R
5|$|A {{combination}} of favorable geographical features {{contributed to the}} success of ancient Egyptian culture, the most important of which was the rich fertile soil resulting from annual inundations of the Nile River. The ancient Egyptians <b>were</b> <b>thus</b> able to produce an abundance of food, allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural, technological, and artistic pursuits. Land management was crucial in ancient Egypt because taxes were assessed based on the amount of land a person owned.|$|E
5|$|According to Confucian teachings, upper-class men honored their {{ancestors}} through rituals carried {{out over the}} course of their lives. These rituals were passed down through generations from father to son. Official family lists were inscribed, with women only acknowledged on that of their marital families. Women who did not produce sons were not inscribed and <b>were</b> <b>thus</b> forgotten from family memory.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, {{after the}} loss of the battle Xerxes {{attempted}} to build a causeway across the channel to attack the Athenian evacuees on Salamis, but this project was soon abandoned. With the Persians' naval superiority removed, Xerxes feared that the Allies might sail to the Hellespont and destroy the pontoon bridges. His general Mardonius volunteered to remain in Greece and complete the conquest with a hand-picked group of troops, while Xerxes retreated to Asia with the bulk of the army. Mardonius over-wintered in Boeotia and Thessaly; the Athenians <b>were</b> <b>thus</b> able to return to their burnt-out city for the winter.|$|E

5|$|As the {{incipient}} ocean widened in the Late Proterozoic and Early Paleozoic, {{it broke}} the continental crust {{in two and}} a true ocean basin developed to the west. All the earlier formations <b>were</b> <b>thus</b> dissected along a steep front on {{the two halves of}} the previous continent. A wedge of clastic sediment then started to accumulate {{at the base of the}} two underwater precipices, starting the formation of opposing continental shelves.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on 25 March, while {{crossing}} the Tyrrhenian Sea, the French squadron was spotted, having {{been reduced to}} ten ships by a storm the previous night. Ganteaume turned his ships to the south-east and Warren gave chase. Gibraltar and Athenienne began to lag behind, and Warren, fearing his force would become fragmented, ordered his faster ships to slow down. The French <b>were</b> <b>thus</b> able to escape into the night, the British continuing on a south-east course while they quietly turned north, back to Toulon.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the program, after the Korean War, the CHA had little means to operate. Go Sangnyeol (고상렬), the administrator of CHA between 1961 and 1968 set out to search for intangible cultural properties {{on the basis of a}} series of articles written by Yae Yonghae (예용해) for Hankook Ilbo, as the reporter spent years in exploring the country and interviewing old masters of handicraft. The first items to be inscribed on the intangible heritage list <b>were</b> <b>thus</b> taken from Yae's articles. Others were added based on the opinions of researchers and also included winners of the annual folk tradition competitions. The recommendation of local administrations was also sought.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "State Shinto" [...] term <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> used to categorize, and abolish, Imperial Japanese {{practices}} that relied on Shinto to support nationalistic ideology. By refusing to ban Shinto practices outright, Japan's post-war constitution <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> able to preserve full Freedom of Religion.|$|R
60|$|It <b>is</b> <b>thus,</b> thou {{great family}} of Sidonia--it <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> that we Gentiles treat thee, when, in our extremest need, thou and thine have aided us with {{mountains}} of gold {{as big as}} lions--and occasionally with wine-warrants and orders for dozens of dressing-cases.|$|R
5|$|Bates {{put forward}} the {{hypothesis}} that the close resemblance between unrelated species was an antipredator adaptation. He noted that some species showed very striking coloration, and flew in a leisurely manner, almost as if taunting predators to eat them. He reasoned that these butterflies were unpalatable to birds and other insectivores, and <b>were</b> <b>thus</b> avoided by them. He extended this logic to forms that closely resembled such protected species, mimicking their warning coloration but not their toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Both commanders were {{a product}} of the {{environment}} of European warfare, which generally took place in open fields with relatively easy mobility, and <b>were</b> <b>thus</b> uncomfortable with woodland warfare. Neither liked the irregular warfare practiced by the Indians and British counterparts like Rogers' Rangers, but saw them as a necessary evil, given the operating environment. Although the French depended on Indian support to increase their comparatively small numbers throughout the war, Indian forces were quite low in this battle, and Montcalm generally disliked them and their practices.|$|E
5|$|Celtic {{qualified}} for the Europa League group stages in 2011–12 in bizarre circumstances. Swiss side Sion defeated Celtic 3–1 on aggregate in the qualifying tie. Sion, however, were {{thrown out of the}} tournament by UEFA due to them fielding ineligible players in the two games against Celtic. Celtic <b>were</b> <b>thus</b> reinstated, eventually finishing third in Group I, behind Atlético Madrid and Udinese and ahead of Rennes.|$|E
30|$|A {{random forest}} <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> {{composed}} of trees having sufficient diversity (thanks to bagging and random subset of attributes) {{each of them}} having low bias (thanks to unpruning). Random forests are known to produce highly accurate classifier and <b>are</b> <b>thus</b> very popular [20].|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{organisation}} <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> still predominantly {{committed to}} orthodox/communist [...] "anti-fascism", which argues that right-wing extremism is inherently linked to market economy systems and that state institutions in western democracies <b>are</b> <b>thus</b> {{more likely to}} support right-wing extremist activity than fight it." ...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "State Shinto" [...] term <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> used to categorize, and abolish, Imperial Japanese {{practices}} that relied on Shinto to support nationalistic ideology.

5|$|Cody {{signed a}} four-year, $3.385 million maximum value {{contract}} with the Ravens on July 26, 2010. In training camp at McDaniel College, Cody—along with veteran cornerback Walt Harris—failed their conditioning test for the Ravens, and <b>were</b> <b>thus</b> placed on the physically unable to perform (PUP) list. He eventually passed the conditioning test on his third try, allowing {{him to go to}} training camp for the Ravens.|$|E
5|$|During heavy rains, it {{was much}} more {{difficult}} to track insurgents by air, negating Portugal's air superiority, and Portuguese troops and vehicles found movement during rain storms difficult. In contrast, the insurgent troops, with lighter equipment, were able to flee into the bush (the mato) amongst an ethnically similar populace into which they could melt away. Furthermore, the FRELIMO forces were able to forage food from the surroundings and local villages, and <b>were</b> <b>thus</b> not hampered by long supply lines.|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{that the}} Greeks might attack the bridges across the Hellespont and trap his army in Europe, Xerxes {{resolved}} to do this, taking {{the greater part}} of the army with him. Mardonius handpicked the troops who were to remain with him in Greece, taking the elite infantry units and cavalry, to complete the conquest of Greece. All of the Persian forces abandoned Attica, however, with Mardonius over-wintering in Boeotia and Thessaly; the Athenians <b>were</b> <b>thus</b> able to return to their burnt city for the winter.|$|E
