5|$|In 1894, the Devon and Somerset Badger Club {{was founded}} by Arthur Blake Heinemann who created the first breed {{standard}} {{for this type of}} terrier. The club was formed with the aim of promoting badger digging, rather than fox hunting. By the turn of the 20th century, the name of John Russell had become associated <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> terrier. The Devon and Somerset Badger Club would go on to be renamed the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club and continued until just before World War II when the club folded.|$|E
5|$|W4 {{is found}} in Camarillo White Horses, a breed {{characterized}} by a white coat, beginning with a spontaneous white stallion born in 1912 named Sultan. Like W1 and W3, horses <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> dominant white may be pure white or near-white, with pigmented areas along the topline that fade with time. This mutation is also an SNP (c.1805C>T), a missense mutation on Exon12.|$|E
25|$|Since, {{hemimegalencephaly}} {{is associated}} with severe seizures, hemiparesis and mental retardation, {{the result is a}} poor prognosis. In most cases, those diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> megalencephaly usually do not survive through adulthood.|$|E
50|$|It has a {{subtropical}} aspect, due to {{the presence}} of the tropical creeper named Periploca graeca. This is a Mediterranean plant which finds its most northern refuge in the Danube Delta. Along <b>with</b> <b>this,</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> liana and other climbing plants are woven on the branches of the trees, such as the wild vine, the hop plant and the ivy.|$|R

25|$|With {{the success}} of new Korean bogies {{underneath}} Northerner carriages, the Southerner cars were also fitted <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> bogie. Work on car underframes was less substantial than that carried out on the Northerner.|$|E

25|$|About 80% {{of cases}} of Ludwig's angina, or {{cellulitis}} of the submandibular space, are caused by dental infections. Mixed infections, due to both aerobes and anaerobes, are commonly associated <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> cellulitis. Typically, this includes alpha-hemolytic streptococci, staphylococci, and bacteroides groups.|$|E
25|$|Microcap fraud {{has been}} a major source of income for {{organized}} crime. Mob figures from each of the Five Families of the New York mafia, as well as the New Jersey mob, have become involved in stock scams.

25|$|Despite {{the small}} {{magnitude}} of effect, {{interpretations of the}} data are politically controversial because of the ease <b>with</b> which <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> research {{can be used for}} political advocacy.

25|$|Rape by males against males {{has been}} heavily stigmatized. According to {{psychologist}} Dr. Sarah Crome, fewer than 1 in 10 male-male rapes are reported. As a group, male rape victims reported {{a lack of}} services and support, and legal systems are often ill-equipped to deal <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> crime.|$|E
25|$|Also, females exhibit mate choice copying. When virgin {{females are}} shown other females copulating {{with a certain}} type of male, they tend to copulate more <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> male {{afterwards}} than naive females (which have not observed the copulation of others). This behavior is sensitive to environmental conditions, and females copy less in bad weather conditions.|$|E
25|$|A {{treatise}} On Sense Perception (Περὶ αἰσθήσεων) and its objects {{is important}} for {{a knowledge of the}} doctrines of the more ancient Greek philosophers regarding the subject.

25|$|Black Creek has a humid {{continental}} climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb),. Like other cities <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> climate, {{there are four}} distinct seasons, often with severe or extreme variation between {{them in terms of}} temperature and precipitation. The village experiences warm, humid, frequently hot summers and long, cold and snowy winters. The variance in temperature and precipitation between months is severe and often extreme.|$|E
25|$|Transfusion-associated graft versus host disease {{frequently}} {{occurs in}} immunodeficient patients where recipient's body failed to eliminate donor's T cells. Instead, donor's T cells attack the recipient's cells. It occurs {{one week after}} transfusion. Fever, rash, diarrhoea are often associated <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> transfusion reaction. Mortality rate is high, with 89.7% of the patients died after 24 days. Immunosuppressive treatment {{is the most common}} way of treatment. Irradiation and leukoreduction of blood products is necessary for high risk patients for prevent T cells from attacking recipient cells.|$|E
25|$|This {{is a rare}} form of synesthesia where {{individuals}} {{feel the}} same sensation that another person feels (such as touch). For instance, when such a synesthete observes someone being tapped on their shoulder, the synesthete involuntarily feels a tap on their own shoulder as well. People <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> synesthesia {{have been shown to}} have higher empathy levels compared to the general population. This {{may be related to the}} so-called mirror neurons present in the motor areas of the brain, which have also been linked to empathy.|$|E
50|$|The paper {{warehouse}} {{can store}} up to 5,000 tons of finished paper and fifteen railroad cars, ten for loading paper and five for unloading kraft, can be “spotted” inside the building.

50|$|In economics, an {{input-output}} {{model is}} a quantitative economic technique that represents the interdependencies between different branches of a national economy or different regional economies. Wassily Leontief (1906-1999) is credited <b>with</b> developing <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> analysis and earned the Nobel Prize in Economics for his development of this model.|$|R
25|$|Green Bay has a humid {{continental}} climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb), with some moderation {{due to the}} city's proximity to Lake Michigan. Like other cities <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> climate, there are four distinct seasons, often with severe or extreme variation between {{them in terms of}} temperature and precipitation. Green Bay experiences warm, humid, frequently hot summers and long, cold and snowy winters. The variance in temperature and precipitation between months is severe and often extreme. Tornadoes are rare in the Green Bay area, with the strongest being an F3 tornado that hit the community of Pittsfield on June 26, 1969.|$|E
25|$|Transfusion-associated acute lung injury (TRALI) is a {{syndrome}} that {{is similar}} to Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which develops within 6 hours during a plasma-product containing blood products transfusion. Fever, hypotension, shortness of breath, and tachycardia often occurs in this type of reaction. It occurs in 15% of the transfused patient with mortality rate of 5 to 10%. Recipient risk factors includes: end-stage liver disease, sepsis, haematological malignancies, sepsis, and ventilated patients. Human Neutrophil Antigen (HNA) has been associated <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> transfusion reaction. Donor's antibodies would interact with recipient's neutrophils and monocytes, releasing inflammatory cytokines and causes pulmonary capillary leakage. The treatment is supportive.|$|E
25|$|With professionalism {{far from}} {{foremost}} concern, The Aquabats' earliest band line-ups changed with almost every concert, occasionally featuring {{as many as}} twelve to fourteen musicians at a time onstage, with the majority typically playing brass instruments. As they gradually developed a steady following and began playing shows with more regularity, the band settled into a tighter and more manageable unit consisting of around eight to nine musicians, filled out by a horn section, two guitarists and a keyboardist. It was <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> line-up that The Aquabats began recording, independently producing the demo tapes The Revenge of the Midget Punchers in 1994 and Bat Boy in 1995.|$|E

50|$|In {{a region}} of {{anomalous}} dispersion, where low-frequency components have faster group velocities than high-frequency ones, {{the opposite of the}} above situation occurs: the onset of the precursor is characterized by a long period, and the period of the signal decreases <b>with</b> time. <b>This</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> precursor is called a low-frequency Sommerfeld precursor.|$|R
5000|$|An {{advantage}} <b>with</b> using <b>this</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> capo {{is that it}} {{does not}} change the intonation in a way that makes the instrument difficult to tune, as it [...] "mimics the grip of a human hand." [...] A disadvantage is that the rubber sleeve may wear, and may need to be replaced.|$|R
