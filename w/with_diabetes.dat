40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze glycemic {{variability}} and insulin resistance of different types of diabetes, emphasizing mainly pancreatic diabetes, using Continuous Glucose Monitoring System（ CGMS）. The study involved a total of 59 patients receiving care at our department: 11 <b>with</b> pancreatic <b>diabetes,</b> 37 <b>with</b> type 2 <b>diabetes,</b> and 11 <b>with</b> type 1 <b>diabetes.</b> The CGMS data and several markers of insulin resistance were compared among the 3 groups and correlations were analyzed statistically. Standard deviation （SDCGMS） measured with CGMS and high molecular weight （HMW） adiponectin （Ad） as parameters of insulin resistance were identified as factors strongly affecting glycemic variability and insulin resistance. The magnitude of glycemic variability in patients <b>with</b> pancreatic <b>diabetes</b> was as large as that in patients <b>with</b> type 1 <b>diabetes.</b> Insulin resistance in patients <b>with</b> pancreatic <b>diabetes</b> was comparable to that in patients <b>with</b> type 1 <b>diabetes.</b> Our results suggest that CGMS data allow evaluation of both glycemic variability and insulin resistance in patients <b>with</b> pancreatic <b>diabetes.</b> HMW-Ad also appears to be a useful parameter of insulin resistance in patients <b>with</b> pancreatic <b>diabetes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Serum {{cholesterol}} and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations were measured in 192 diabetics (94 with juvenile-onset and 98 <b>with</b> maturity-onset <b>diabetes)</b> and 177 non-diabetic controls.

40|$|Abstract Background Patients <b>with</b> type 2 <b>diabetes</b> {{mellitus}} {{and heart}} failure have adverse clinical outcomes, but the characteristics and prognosis of those <b>with</b> undiagnosed <b>diabetes</b> {{in this setting}} has not been established. Methods In total, 400 patients admitted consecutively with acute heart failure were grouped in three glycaemic categories: no diabetes, clinical diabetes (previously reported or with hypoglycaemic treatment) and undiagnosed diabetes. The latter was defined {{by the presence of}} at least two measurements of fasting plasma glycaemia ≥ 7 mmol/L before or after the acute episode. Group differences were tested by proportional hazards models in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality during a 7 -year follow-up. Results There were 188 (47 %) patients without diabetes, 149 (37 %) <b>with</b> clinical <b>diabetes</b> and 63 (16 %) <b>with</b> undiagnosed <b>diabetes.</b> Patients <b>with</b> undiagnosed <b>diabetes</b> had a lower prevalence of hypertension, dyslipidaemia, peripheral vascular disease and previous myocardial infarction than those <b>with</b> clinical <b>diabetes</b> and similar to that of those without diabetes. The adjusted hazards ratios for 7 -year total and cardiovascular mortality compared with the group of subjects without diabetes were 1. 69 (95 % CI: 1. 17 - 2. 46) and 2. 45 (95 % CI: 1. 58 - 3. 81) for those <b>with</b> undiagnosed <b>diabetes,</b> and 1. 48 (95 % CI: 1. 10 - 1. 99) and 2. 01 (95 % CI: 1. 40 - 2. 89) for those <b>with</b> clinical <b>diabetes.</b> Conclusions Undiagnosed diabetes is common in patients requiring hospitalization for acute heart failure. Patients <b>with</b> undiagnosed <b>diabetes,</b> despite having a lower cardiovascular risk profile than those <b>with</b> clinical <b>diabetes,</b> show a similar increased mortality. </p...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} serum {{concentration of}} C-reactive protein (CRP) {{and measures of}} adi-posity in patients <b>with</b> type <b>diabetes</b> mellitus (male, female) and age and sex-matched apparently healthy subjects. CRP concentration was determined by laser nephelometry (BN II Analyzer) and Car-dioPhase high-sensitivity CRP (DADE BEHRING) was used as reagent which consists of polystyrene particles coated with mouse monoclonal antibodies to CRP. Results have shown that serum CRP concentration in patients <b>with</b> type <b>diabetes</b> mel-litus was statistically signifi cantly higher compared to control group of healthy subjects (p<,). Body mass index (BMI) correlated signifi cantly with serum concentration of CRP in patients <b>with</b> type <b>diabetes</b> mellitus (r=,; p<,). Statistically signifi cant positive correlation was also found between waist to hip ratio and serum CRP concentra-tion in patients <b>with</b> type <b>diabetes</b> mellitus (r=,; p<,). Elevated serum CRP concentration in patients <b>with</b> type <b>diabetes</b> mellitus is probably caused {{by the presence of}} chronic low-grade infl ammation in these patients. It is pos-sible that determined increase of CRP concentration refl ects activation of innate immune system components in patients <b>with</b> type <b>diabetes</b> mellitus.

40|$|Several {{studies suggest}} that the {{response}} to various stressors differs between the sexes. We aimed to study serum HSP 70 and levels of oxidized-LDL (ox-LDL) as markers of oxidative stress in men and women <b>with</b> type 2 <b>diabetes.</b> We quantified serum HSP 70 and levels of ox-LDL in three cohorts; patients <b>with</b> newly diagnosed <b>diabetes,</b> patients <b>with</b> long-standing <b>diabetes</b> and normal controls. The cohort of patients <b>with</b> newly diagnosed <b>diabetes</b> was followed up for 3  months under glucose-lowering therapy with metformin. Our findings showed that serum HSP 70 level was increased in women <b>with</b> long-standing <b>diabetes</b> in comparison <b>with</b> men. HSP 70 did not decrease after glucose lowering therapy in women <b>with</b> newly diagnosed <b>diabetes,</b> but it did decrease in men. There was no significant difference on ox-LDL between men and women in any of the studied cohorts. It decreased significantly in the cohort of patients <b>with</b> newly diagnosed <b>diabetes</b> after treatment, regardless of sex. There was no significant correlation between HSP 70 and ox-LDL in any of the studied cohorts except among normal women. We suggest that diabetes induces an immune response and impairs cellular defense mechanisms against oxidative stress more commonly in women <b>with</b> type 2 <b>diabetes</b> than in men...|$|R

40|$|Background: More {{women are}} {{entering}} pregnancy <b>with</b> pre-existing <b>diabetes.</b> Disease severity, glycaemic control, and predictors of pregnancy complications may differ by race/ethnicity or educational attainment, leading {{to differences in}} adverse pregnancy outcomes. Methods: We used linked New York City hospital record and birth certificate data for 6291 singleton births among women <b>with</b> pre-existing <b>diabetes</b> between 1995 and 2003. We defined maternal race/ethnicity as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, South Asian, and East Asian, and education level as 12 years. Our outcomes were pre-eclampsia, preterm birth (PTB) (< 37 weeks gestation and categorised as spontaneous or medically indicated), as well as small-for-gestational age (SGA) and large-for-gestational age (LGA). Using multivariable binomial regression, we estimated the risk ratios for pre-eclampsia, SGA, and LGA. We used multivariable multinomial regression to estimate odds ratios (OR) for PTB. Results: Compared with non-Hispanic white women <b>with</b> pre-existing <b>diabetes,</b> non-Hispanic black and Hispanic women <b>with</b> pre-existing <b>diabetes</b> had a 1. 50 -fold increased risk of pre-eclampsia compared with non-Hispanic whites <b>with</b> pre-existing <b>diabetes,</b> after full adjustment.

40|$|The {{degree of}} fasting {{hyperglycemia}} in patients <b>with</b> non-insulin-dependent <b>diabetes</b> mellitus {{is dependent on}} the rate of hepatic glucose production. The basal rate of hepatic glucose production is increased in patients <b>with</b> non-insulin-dependent <b>diabetes</b> mellitus, and there is a positive correlation between hepatic glucose production and fasting glucose levels. Diminished secretion of insulin, impaired hepatic sensitivity to insulin's effects, or a combination of these factors could contribute to the elevated hepatic glucose production in patients <b>with</b> non-insulin-dependent <b>diabetes</b> mellitus. The relationship between insulin secretion and hepatic glucose production is regulated by a closed feedback loop operating between glucose levels and pancreatic beta cells. Although fasting insulin levels are usually comparable between patients <b>with</b> non-insulin-dependent <b>diabetes</b> mellitus and normal subjects, insulin secretion is markedly impaired in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in relation to the degree of hyperglycemia present. In fact, the degree of fasting hyperglycemia in a given patient <b>with</b> non-insulin-dependent <b>diabetes</b> mellitus is closely related to the degree of impaired pancreatic beta-cell responsiveness to glucose. Such findings suggest that impaired insulin secretion leads to increased hepatic glucose production, which raises the plasma glucose level. The resulting hyperglycemia helps to maintain relatively normal basal insulin output. Chronic sulfonylurea drug therapy of patients <b>with</b> non-insulin-dependent <b>diabetes</b> mellitus enhances pancreatic islet sensitivity to glucose, leading to increased insulin secretion, suppression of hepatic glucose production, and a decline in the steady-state fasting glucose level...|$|R

Overall the lifetime risk of stroke in women exceeds that in men. The risk of cardiovascular disease amongst those <b>with</b> <b>diabetes</b> and amongst smokers is also higher in women than in men.

Methods: A sample of South Australian adults (n= 481) aged 33 - 88 years <b>with</b> type 2 <b>diabetes,</b> including 55 people with peripheral neuropathy, completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Levels of self-reported physical activity were compared between those with and without peripheral neuropathy. Results: People <b>with</b> type 2 <b>diabetes</b> and peripheral neuropathy (Mdn = 1433, IQR = 495 – 3390 MET. min/wk) were less physically active than those without peripheral neuropathy (Mdn = 2106, IQR = 876 – 4380 MET. min/wk) (p = 0. 04). A total of 49 % of people <b>with</b> type 2 <b>diabetes</b> and peripheral neuropathy met physical activity recommendations of 150 minutes of at least moderate activity per week, compared to 57 % of people <b>with</b> type 2 <b>diabetes</b> alone. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that people <b>with</b> type 2 <b>diabetes</b> and peripheral neuropathy reported being significantly less active than people <b>with</b> type 2 <b>diabetes</b> alone. People <b>with</b> type 2 <b>diabetes</b> and peripheral neuropathy need to be encouraged to perform higher levels of physical activity for biological, physical and psychological benefits.
