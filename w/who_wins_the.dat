5|$|Previously, the EIHL champions {{were invited}} {{to play in the}} Continental Cup, Europe's 2nd level club competition. For the 2009–10 tournament, the EIHLs {{entrants}} entered the tournament in the penultimate (3rd) group stage. However, with the introduction of the Champions Hockey League, this has changed. From the 2015–16 season, the top 2 teams in the EIHL will participate in the CHL, with either the team <b>who</b> <b>wins</b> <b>the</b> post-season playoffs, or the team finishing third if the playoffs winner {{is one of the top}} two, entering the Continental Cup.|$|E
5|$|Elections for {{president}} occur {{every five years}} by a national vote. Candidates, {{as soon as they}} are deemed eligible under Article 80 of the Constitution, are tasked with collecting signatures from eligible voters. After 100,000 signatures are collected and certified, the candidate is declared to be official by the Central Elections Committee. In the voting, the secret ballots are collected directly from eligible voters. During the first round of voting, if a candidate earns fifty percent plus one of the votes, they are declared the President-elect. If no one has achieved that number during the first round, then a run-off election will occur between two candidates who won the most votes. The person <b>who</b> <b>wins</b> <b>the</b> most votes in the run-off is declared the President-elect.|$|E
5|$|Proposed in {{the form}} of an interstate compact, the {{agreement}} would go into effect among the participating states in the compact only after they collectively represent an absolute majority of votes (currently at least 270) in the Electoral College. In the next presidential election after adoption by the requisite number of states, the participating states would award all of their electoral votes to presidential electors associated with the candidate <b>who</b> <b>wins</b> <b>the</b> overall popular vote in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. As a result, the winner of the national popular vote would always win the presidency by always securing a majority of votes in the Electoral College. Until the compact's conditions are met, all states award electoral votes in their current manner.|$|E
50|$|During his {{breeding}} life, Tanino has sired many foals. A {{couple of}} notable ones are, Vodka, <b>who</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> Tokyo Yushun, Hagino Hybrid, <b>who</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> Kyoto Shimban Hai, and Midsummer Fair <b>who</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> Sankai Sports Sho Flora Stakes.|$|R
50|$|The stable bred {{and raced}} Azra <b>who</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> 1892 Derby and Sir Huon <b>who</b> <b>won</b> it in 1906. Under Long's name, he raced homebred Hindus <b>who</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> 1900 Preakness Stakes. As well, George Long bred Manuel <b>who</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> 1899 Derby for Alfred & Dave Morris.|$|R
5000|$|The event {{had many}} past champions involved. Alberta was skipped by Tim Krassman, <b>who</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> event with Dean Ross in 2008. Nova Scotia was skipped by Paul Flemming, <b>who</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> event in 1999 and 2003. PEI was skipped by Robert Campbell, <b>who</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> event in 1989.|$|R
5|$|The tournament has {{a number}} of traditions. Since 1949, a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, {{although}} it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer <b>who</b> <b>wins</b> <b>the</b> event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket). The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by Ben Hogan in 1952, is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in 1963, legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot {{on the morning of the}} first round to commence play. These have included Fred McLeod, Jock Hutchinson, Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, and Gary Player. Since 1960, a semi-social contest at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.|$|E
25|$|For {{the mixed}} doubles, in every game, {{the first team}} to score four points, wins the game. In other words, should a deuce happen in a game, the team <b>who</b> <b>wins</b> <b>the</b> next point wins the game.|$|E
25|$|FIDE rules {{provide for}} a single fast decisive game. Black gets five minutes on the clock whereas White gets six minutes but must win (i.e. a draw counts as a win for Black). The player <b>who</b> <b>wins</b> <b>the</b> draw of lots may choose which color he wants.|$|E

25|$|Under WIGT the 50 E>A>C>D votes again 'skip' {{candidate}} A {{and transfer}} to C <b>who</b> <b>wins</b> <b>the</b> second seat. All C's votes (both the E>A>C>D votes and the C>B votes) then transfer at reduced value. As {{a result of this}} transfer candidate B wins the third seat. The WIGT winners are A, C and B.|$|E
25|$|In both {{codes of}} rugby, rugby league and rugby union, the player <b>who</b> <b>wins</b> <b>the</b> award {{is usually the}} person who has {{performed}} consistently well throughout the game. In televised or sponsored matches, the commentator or company sponsoring the event usually decides who gets the award, and it is presented to the winner after the match.|$|E
25|$|The quota is 100 and A {{is elected}} at stage 1. E {{is the first}} {{candidate}} to be eliminated. Under SGT the 50 E>A>C>D votes ‘skip’ candidate A and transfer to candidate C; who is then elected. These votes then transfer again to candidate D <b>who</b> <b>wins</b> <b>the</b> final seat. The SGT winners are A, C and D.|$|E

25|$|The captain <b>who</b> <b>wins</b> <b>the</b> toss {{must choose}} whether to bat or field. The {{decision}} {{is of great}} tactical importance, and the captain will have considered many variables before arriving at his decision. Because of the different natures of the games, it is considerably more common to choose to bat second in one-day cricket {{than it is in}} Test cricket.|$|E
25|$|In cricket the toss {{is often}} significant, as the {{decision}} whether to bat or bowl first {{can influence the}} outcome of the game. Similarly, in tennis a coin toss is used in professional matches to determine which player serves first. The player <b>who</b> <b>wins</b> <b>the</b> toss decides whether to serve first or return, while the loser of the toss decides which end of the court each player plays on first.|$|E
25|$|The {{play-off}} {{system has}} been criticized because more points per match can be earned in the play-off stage than in the regular competition. This way the team <b>who</b> <b>wins</b> <b>the</b> most matches isn't automatically the national champion. The biggest upside {{in favor of the}} play-off system is the higher number of matches (40 instead of 34 compared to the previous season) and more top matches. The extra matches also generate higher revenues for the teams.|$|E
50|$|Quiz's best {{offspring}} {{was probably}} Tigris, <b>who</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> 2000 Guineas in 1815. He also sired Tigris' full brother Euphrates who {{finished third in}} <b>the</b> Derby and <b>won</b> <b>the</b> Doncaster Cup and Roller, <b>who</b> <b>won</b> <b>the</b> Craven Stakes.|$|R
5000|$|Writing for The New York Times in 2015, Stephen Burt {{described}} Cave Canem as [...] "a major incubator for {{the current}} renaissance in black poetry, which includes the poets Tracy K.

25|$|In 2004-05, Italy's {{professional}} league {{introduced a}} promotion playoff to its second tier of football, Serie B. It operates almost identically {{to the system}} currently used in England. The top two clubs in Serie B earn automatic promotion to Serie A with the next four clubs entering a playoff to determine <b>who</b> <b>wins</b> <b>the</b> third promotion place, as long as fewer than 10 points separate the third and fourth-placed teams (which often occurs).|$|E
25|$|Test cricket {{is played}} in innings (the word denotes both the {{singular}} and the plural). In each innings, one team bats {{and the other}} bowls (or fields). Ordinarily four innings are played in a Test match, and each team bats twice and bowls twice. Before the start of play on the first day, the two team captains and the match referee toss a coin; the captain <b>who</b> <b>wins</b> <b>the</b> toss decides whether his team will bat or bowl first.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} version of pinochle involves a partial deal of twelve cards to both players in sets of four, leaving a stock of 24 cards. A player can score one meld after each trick won {{of the first}} 12 tricks. Melded cards can even be used to win tricks. After each trick, players draw one card from the stock into their hand starting with the trick-winning player. For the last 12 tricks, melds are taken into each player's hand and are no longer announced by the player <b>who</b> <b>wins</b> <b>the</b> trick. The traditional trick-taking rules apply only for these last 12 tricks.|$|E

25|$|Since 1969, two of Maine's four {{electoral votes}} have been awarded {{based on the}} winner of the statewide election; the other two go to the highest vote-getter in each of the state's two congressional districts. Every other state except Nebraska gives all its electoral votes to the {{candidate}} <b>who</b> <b>wins</b> <b>the</b> popular vote in the state at large, without regard to performance within districts. Maine split its electoral vote {{for the first time in}} 2016, with Donald Trump's strong showing in central and northern Maine allowing him to capture one of the state's four votes in the Electoral College.|$|E
25|$|Since 1997, the {{two teams}} have played each other {{as part of the}} regular season, with the {{exception}} of 2002. The Ohio Cup was reintroduced in 2008 and is presented to the team <b>who</b> <b>wins</b> <b>the</b> most games in the series that season. Initially, the teams only played one three-game series per season, meeting in Cleveland in 1997 and Cincinnati the following year. Since 1999, the teams have played two series per season against each other, one series at each ballpark. A four-game home-and-home format was introduced in 2013 where the teams play a four-game series with two games in each city back-to-back. This format was also used in 2014 and again in 2016 and 2017, while the 2015 meetings again featured two separate three-game series. Through the 2017 meetings, the Indians lead the series 56–47.|$|E
25|$|When Pat {{gets home}} {{and tries to}} tell Sara {{about the fact that}} the honeymoon is {{cancelled}} because the new boss has cancelled all bonuses, his son Julian (voiced by Sandra Teles) shows Pat a TV talent show, You're the One, hosted by Simon Cowbell (voiced by Robin Atkin Downes in typical Simon Cowell voice), which states the next auditions are coming to Greendale. Cowbell also confirms that the person <b>who</b> <b>wins</b> <b>the</b> contest will be awarded a holiday to Italy and a recording contract. Pat decides to take part in the contest and his unexpected singing voice (played by Ronan Keating) wins the contest. Pat is to sing again in the finale, in a head-to-head contest with the winner of another heat, Josh (voiced by Rupert Grint). His manager, Wilf (voiced by David Tennant), however, is very keen to make sure it is his client who wins at all costs.|$|E
