5|$|After the {{municipal}} merger between Oslo and Aker in 1948, Akersbanerne was merged into Oslo Sporveier, although Holmenkolbanen remained a partially owned subsidiary. In 1973, Oslo Sporveier bought the remaining shares, {{and two years}} later the operations were transferred to Oslo Sporveier, with Holmenkolbanen remaining a pure real estate company. The municipal take-over resulted in an upgrade to both the track and the rolling stock. New overhead wires and new and heavier track were laid. From 1978, the T1300 trains <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> use. With the take-over, the lines were numbered, and the Sognsvann Line designated 81, although this was quickly changed to 13.|$|E

5|$|Constantine XI died without {{producing}} an heir, and had Constantinople not fallen {{he might have}} been succeeded by the sons of his deceased elder brother, who <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> the palace service of Mehmed II after the fall of Constantinople. The oldest boy, re-christened as Has Murad, became a personal favorite of Mehmed and served as Beylerbey (Governor-General) of the Balkans. The younger son, renamed Mesih Pasha, became Admiral of the Ottoman fleet and Sancak Beg (Governor) of the Province of Gallipoli. He eventually served twice as Grand Vizier under Mehmed's son, Bayezid II.|$|E
5|$|Since Humphrey (VI) {{was only}} {{sixteen years old}} at the time of his father's death, the Braose lands <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> the king's custody until 1270. Part of this inheritance, the Marcher lordship of Brecon, was in the {{meanwhile}} given to the custody of Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Hertford. Humphrey technically regained his lordship from Clare in 1270, but by this time these lands had effectively been taken over by the Welsh prince Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, who had taken advantage of the previous decade's political chaos in England to extend his territory into the Marches.|$|E
5|$|The abbey {{relatively}} quickly {{fell into}} disuse and eventual disrepair after its dissolution at the Reformation, the {{lead from the}} roof rumoured to {{have been used in}} the 16th century civil wars and the stonework plundered for housebuilding throughout the town.

For the rest of the month, the brigade was involved in several smaller operations. In Operation Pigeon on 30January, they searched the Shapira district of Tel Aviv.|$|E

The last terrorist was identified by Sim Harris and led away by the SAS.|$|E
5|$|Troll Airfield {{was opened}} on 11 February 2005 by Queen Sonja of Norway {{and the new}} {{research}} station the following day. At first, Antonov An-2, DHC-6/300 Twin Otters, Dorniers 228 and smaller aircraft {{were used for the}} services. Later, two Basler BT-67, operated by Antarctic Logistics Centre International, <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> use. The cooperation has resulted in the availability of larger aircraft more suited for research, through coordinated search and rescue operations between the participating countries. On 19 January 2008, the airfield was visited by Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg.|$|E

5|$|Tuatara {{were removed}} from Stanley, Red Mercury and Cuvier Islands in 1990 and 1991, and {{maintained}} in captivity to allow Polynesian rats to be eradicated on those islands. All three populations bred in captivity, and after successful eradication of the rats, all individuals, including the new juveniles, were returned to their islands of origin. In the 1991–92 season, Little Barrier Island was found to hold only eight tuatara, which <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> in situ captivity, where females produced 42eggs, which were incubated at Victoria University. The resulting offspring were subsequently held in an enclosure on the island, then released into the wild in 2006 after rats were eradicated there.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the first}} year of opening, it became {{apparent}} to the management and investors that the estimated passenger numbers for the CCE and the other UERL lines had been over-optimistic. Despite improved integration and cooperation with the other tube railways, and the later extensions, the CCE struggled financially. In 1933 the CCE {{and the rest of the}} UERL <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> public ownership. Today, the CCE's tunnels and stations form the Northern line's Charing Cross branch from Kennington to Camden Town, the Edgware branch from Camden Town to Edgware, and the High Barnet branch from Camden Town to Archway.|$|E
5|$|After Colonel Brigg's {{death in}} 1900, the castle {{passed into the}} hands of the Wearmouth Coal Company about 1908, and from there to the National Coal Board. Due to the {{expansion}} of Sunderland in the 1940s, the castle became surrounded by housing estates including those of Castletown and Hylton Castle. The castle was vandalised and had the lead from its roof stolen. In 1950, due to local pressure and the threat of demolition, the castle and chapel <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> the care of the Ministry of Works. Due to the advanced decay of the 19th-century alterations, the ministry removed all internal partitions and consolidated the shell to reveal the remaining medieval masonry. The ministry also appointed a full-time custodian and replaced the missing lead roof with roofing felt to make the site waterproof.|$|E

5|$|After knifing {{another man}} during a fight, {{in an attack}} he claimed was {{triggered}} by the abuse he had suffered since the trial, Smith was sentenced {{to three years in}} prison in 1969. That same year his children <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> the care of the local authority. His wife Maureen moved from Underwood Court to a single-bedroom property, and found work in a department store. Subjected to whispering campaigns and petitions to remove her from the estate where she lived, she received no support from her family—her mother had supported Myra during the trial. On his release from prison, David Smith moved in with the girl who became his second wife and won custody of his three sons. Maureen managed to repair the relationship with her mother, and moved into a council property in Gorton. She divorced Smith in 1973, and married a lorry driver, Bill Scott, with whom she had a daughter.|$|E
5|$|After {{the line}} had {{been relegated to}} a branch line, traffic fell considerably. Another factor was car traffic, which {{did not exist in}} Flekkefjord until 1918, but {{thereafter}} became widespread. After the war, Class 20 steam locomotives were used on the line. During the 1940, several railcars of Class 87 <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> use, and soon all passenger trains were operated using such units. From 1956 to 1966, also Class 86 units were used on the line, but the narrow profile of the tunnels made operations problematic. Class 87 remained in service until 1981, when used Class 89 units were bought from Sweden. At first, two Y7 units were brought to Norway on 23 January and taken into service on 24 February. After they proved to work well, NSB bought them for 95,000 Swedish kronor plus freight. Two more units were bought in 1986.|$|E
5|$|All three {{captured}} ships <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> the Royal Navy. The name of Alexandre {{reverted to}} the former Alexander, and although James suggests that the ship was never again fit for frontline service, this claim is refuted by Alexanders presence in {{the line at the}} Battle of the Nile in 1798 under Captain Alexander Ball. Tigre retained her French name, while Formidable, as there was already a ship of that name in the Royal Navy, became HMS Belleisle, apparently due to confusion between the islands of Groix and Belle Île {{in the aftermath of the}} battle. Belleisle had a long and successful career, fighting at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 under Captain William Hargood.|$|E

5|$|Boeing 737-700s <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> use {{starting}} in 1998, {{and the company}} rebranded from Braathens SAFE to Braathens. That year also saw the opening of Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which increased Braathens number of slots and allowed them {{to start a new}} route to Haugesund. Braathens started a costly price war with its competitors Color Air and SAS; after Color Air went bankrupt in 1999, Braathens started terminating routes, and the Swedish division was merged into the subsidiary Malmö Aviation. Málaga and Alicante were introduced as destinations in 2000. The next year, Braathens was bought by the SAS Group, and in 2002, the routes were split between SAS and Braathens. The latter kept only four international routes, but was granted new services to Northern Norway: Alta, Bardufoss, Kirkenes and Lakselv. Braathens was merged with SAS to create SAS Braathens in 2004.|$|E
5|$|During 1997, {{there were}} five {{incidents}} where NSB's Nordic Mobile Telephone equipment interfered with the locomotive's electronics, causing the emergency brakes to activate. This caused a temporary halt until the motorman had unlocked the brakes. The problem was fixed by moving NSB's mobile senders. The units <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> use on the Bergen Line from 5 January 1997. Later they entered into use on the Dovre and Sørland Lines, and then on regional trains around Oslo, such as the Vestfold Line. In August 1998, NSB stated that El 18 used more power {{than some of the}} substation transformers along the line could handle, particularly along the Vestfold Line. Part of the problem was caused by a mechanism in the locomotives whereby the motor was turned off if the wheels spin. The result was that the full power output of the El 18 along parts of the railway network could not be utilized.|$|E
5|$|During the fighting, {{out of a}} {{total of}} 976 men deployed, the {{battalion}} lost 137 men killed in action and 106 wounded, while a further 24 suffered from shell shock. A total of 808 men <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>into</b> captivity, including most of the wounded. Four men managed to escape to Australia but of the remaining men, 263 died while prisoners of war. Following their capture, the men from the 2/4th in Singapore were concentrated in Changi prison, before being split up and sent to various prison camps around the Pacific, including Borneo, Burma, Thailand, Java, Sumatra, Japan and Formosa. There they were used as slave labour on the Burma–Thai Railway, in coal mines and on wharves, during which they were subjected to harsh treatment, starvation, disease and extreme brutality, which took a heavy toll. Many soldiers from the 2/4th were also killed while being taken to Japan, when the ships were sunk by Allied submarines.|$|E
