500|$|Some reviewers {{have placed}} parts the novel in the mystery genre. Edinger found {{that despite the}} broad genres, the novel is mainly [...] "a thrilling puzzle". She relates the pieces slowly; clues {{are found in the}} story itself, on the map, in words and chapter titles. At {{the end of the book}} {{everything}} is tied together and makes sense. Ann Crewdson of School Library Journal found that each note Miranda receives foreshadows the next event. Each note is [...] "skillfully" [...] integrated into the novel, along with subsequent clues, until the climax is reached and all the clues come together. Stead's editor Lamb agreed with the mystery genre, in that [...] "there's plenty to wonder about after you finish the book. Just as we wonder <b>why</b> <b>our</b> feelings change so suddenly, or why someone like the laughing man appears on the corner one day." [...] Gurdon of The Wall Street Journal concurred with Lamb, adding that although the novel is clearly a mystery, the mystery itself is not revealed until the end where the last note comes and where everything ties together.|$|E

500|$|The 2003-04 {{comic book}} miniseries Wanted, by Mark Millar and J. G. Jones, {{came to the}} {{attention}} of [...] Universal Pictures through executive Jeff Kirschenbaum, a comic book fan who sought a film adaptation that would be considered a [...] "hard-R" [...] and encouraged the studio to pick up the rights to the miniseries. By 2004, producer Marc Platt had gotten the film rights, and lobbied the studio to get Russian-Kazakh director Timur Bekmambetov, as Platt considered that the visual style and sensibility Bekmambetov showed in Night Watch and Day Watch [...] fit Wanted as “the comic is dark and edgy but it also has an ironic, comedic tone beneath its violent action”. In December 2005, Bekmambetov was hired to helm the project, his first English-language film, and writers Derek Haas and Michael Brandt were assigned the script. Bekmambetov described the original comic as [...] "risky and very provocative", with [...] "a twist and good characters", and declared that the thing that attracted him the most in Wanted was how it went through various film genres in its plot: [...] "It’s a comedy, a tragedy, a drama, a melodrama. Every scene, we change genres and that’s <b>why</b> <b>our</b> movie is different.” ...|$|E

Ivașcu was especially enthusiastic about Călinescu's plan to transform Iași into a Romanian cultural capital: this, he noted, was [...] "the very reason <b>why</b> <b>our</b> paper exists." [...] Upon Ivănescu's return to Iași, Ivașcu lost his university position, and taught Romanian Literature {{at a high school}} in Iași. In January 1939, he became editorial secretary at Călinescu's Jurnalul Literar. Ivașcu greatly admired Călinescu's antifascism and rationalism; however, the Siguranța reported of his debates with Călinescu, with the latter refusing to allow more communists at Jurnalul Literar. According to such sources, Călinescu feared that a left-turn would expose the magazine to attacks from the far-right. Still, Călinescu paid homage to Ivașcu as an [...] "excellent" [...] journalist and man of letters, with [...] "a great devotion to a certain idea." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Harry Potter {{series of}} fantasy novels by J. K. Rowling have become {{some of the}} most widely read works of children's {{literature}} in history, with readers of all ages and in many countries. In April 2011 worldwide sales of Harry Potter books were estimated to be about 450 million copies,. Oddly enough, it has been difficult to accurately determine with any degree of certainty exactly how many languages Harry Potter has been translated into. As best as can be determined (as of 2017), The Philosopher's Stone has been officially translated from the original English into 73 other languages. A 74th language, Scots, was announced on 2017-06-28 and it is expected to be available in October, 2017. Both Bloomsbury's and J.K. Rowling's sites have recently stated that the books have been translated into 79 languages (80 with the 2017-06-28 announcement of Scots); however, {{it has been argued that}} number actually represents the number of authorized translations (of The Philosopher's Stone) plus the original English. The number of authorized translations is not equal to the number of languages because there have been multiple authorized translations into the same language. Specifically, there have been two separate translations into each of: Mandarin Chinese, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian and Turkish (5 languages). English is often included in the list of translations even though technically it should not be (indeed, it is <b>why</b> <b>our</b> list here counts up to 74). Thus: 79 [...] English [...] 5 double-translations = 73. It is also worthwhile to emphasize that not all seven books are have been translated into these 73 languages.|$|E
2500|$|... "By sunset on March 9 {{thousands}} of men, women, children started to gather outside {{the walls of}} the Summer Palace." [...] On March 10, 1959, the crowd surrounded the summer palace in response to a rumor that the Chinese communists were planning to arrest the Dalai Lama at a cultural performance in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) camp. The people were determined not to allow the Dalai Lama to leave Norbulingka palace. Some members of the crowd directed aggression at Tibetan officials that were thought to be Chinese collaborators. Tenpa Soepa, who was staying at a house on the night of March 10th near Norbulingka said, [...] "When I arrived at the gate I found Kalon Sampho lying on the ground unconscious." [...] Sampho, [...] "...had arrived at Norbulinka [...] in a car with his Chinese bodyguard. They got out of their car and when the crowd saw the Chinese guard they began throwing stones." [...] "Phakpalha Khenchung ...had been killed by the protestors. He was a government official, and it was rumored that he had a very close relationship with the Chinese." [...] PLA General Tan considered the Dalai Lama to be in danger and offered him refuge if he could make it to the Chinese camp. He declined the offer. A week into the fighting, the general ordered two mortar rounds shot toward the palace. At that point, the Dalai Lama decided {{the time had come to}} slip out over the mountains, with a very small party, arriving a few days later at the Indian border. He was granted asylum by the Nehru government with the stipulation that he would not engage in politics on Indian soil. Meanwhile, Enlai dissolved the Tibetan government and appointed the Preparatory Committee for the Founding of the Tibet Autonomous Region to take its place. In 1959, Tenpa Soepa and other prisoners of war near Toema in Amdo said, [...] "Along the road we could see <b>why</b> <b>our</b> guards were so jumpy. We saw many burnt-out guardposts and even some tanks that were destroyed by Tibetan guerillas. This was Amdo, where the guerrilla war had gone on for years." ...|$|E
