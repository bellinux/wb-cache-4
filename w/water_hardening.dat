To elucidate {{the effects of}} hormones on embryonic development, steelhead trout eggs, Oncorhynchus mykiss, were immersed in either cortisol, testosterone, or thyroxine at two different stages of development. Elevated concentrations of cortisol were detectable in the trout eggs or embryos after immersion. Eggs exposed to cortisol during <b>water</b> <b>hardening</b> hatched faster than eggs exposed at the eyed stage. Eggs that hatched faster had elevated cortisol and cortisol glucuronide concentrations at hatch compared to groups immersed at eyed or control groups.

Eggs exposed to cortisol at the earlier developmental stage {{did not appear to}} clear or convert cortisol as efficiently as those exposed at a later stage.

The optimal pH for raw and modified pumices were found to be 6. 0, leading to the removal of 79 and 96 % of calcium and 51 and 93 % of magnesium by 10 g/L of raw and modified pumice adsorbents, respectively. Maximum adsorption capacities were 57. 27 and 62. 34 mg/g for Ca 2 + and 44. 53 and 56. 11 mg/g for Mg 2 + on the raw and modified pumices, respectively.

40|$|The {{acute and}} chronic effects of secondary-treated {{effluent}} from a New Zealand {{pulp and paper}} mill were assessed using both long-term adult and early life stage (ELS) laboratory exposures of rainbow trout. The relative impact of maternal exposure versus ELS exposure was assessed by a comparison of directly exposed eggs and larvae with the eggs and larvae of exposed adult trout that were reared in reference water. Rainbow trout were exposed to a secondary-treated mixed thermomechanical/bleached kraft mill effluent at a concentration of 15 % or to reference water from the egg through to 320 -d-old juveniles. The 2 adult rainbow trout exposures were undertaken with nominal concentrations of 10 % and 12 % treated effluent, respectively. There was no marked effect of <b>water</b> <b>hardening</b> with 15 % effluent on fertility or survival of eggs to 16 d. In a subsequent exposure (with hardening in reference water), no significant effects were found on mortality to hatch, time to hatch, length at hatch, mortality to swim-up, mortality to 320 d, or deformity rate at hatch. At experimental termination (320 d), direct-exposed juveniles had smaller livers and reduced condition factor, likely {{due to differences in}} food consumption. In 2 subsequent consecutive experiments, exposure of adult trout to 10 % and 12 % effluent for 2 mo, followed by incubation of the fertilized eggs in reference water, produced no impact on fertility, survival to hatch, survival to swim-up, or length and weight of fry at swim-up. Exposure of adult trout to 12 % treated effluent for 8 mo prior to egg fertilization also did not result in differing rates of fertility, mortality to hatch or mortality to swim-up. However, the 8 -mo maternal exposure did result in swim-up fry that were significantly shorter and weighed less than the reference swim-up fry. This difference was directly attributable to smaller eggs in the 8 -mo-exposed female trout. These results demonstrate that this pulp and paper mill effluent is more likely to elicit indirect impacts on progeny size through chronic exposure of adults to effluent during gonadal recrudescence rather than through direct exposure of early life stages to effluent.

40|$|This thesis {{examined}} {{novel and}} previously utilised parameters of egg quality to determine and define reproductive success in farmed and wild salmonids. The effect of holding environment and inter-female variation on salmonid egg quality was also examined. Furthermore, two nutritional feed trials were undertaken {{to investigate whether}} organic Se, supplemented into salmonids broodstock diets, was vertically transferred to their eggs and what affect this dietary supplementation had on egg quality. Finally, the possibility that morphological and biochemical adaptations are present on the chorion of eggs from European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) was investigated in a resident Scottish population. Chapter 2 examined methods to determine egg quality using eggs from a single population of brown trout (Salmo trutta). Egg survival, provided a biologically relevant definition for egg quality, which was used throughout this study to assess the importance of selected egg quality parameters. Based on {{a review of the}} literature and the relationship between parameters of egg quality and egg survival rates, three determinants of egg quality were chosen for further examination. These were chorion breaking strength, elemental concentrations within the egg and the protein profile of the chorion. Brown trout broodstock from a single population were separated prior to spawning and exposed to two different holding units, ‘Ae system’ or ‘S. C. E. N. E. system’ at two sites. Eggs were stripped from females and 13 determinants of egg quality collected, analysed individually, combined by principle components analysis into an integrated egg quality score which was validated against egg survival. The multivariate egg quality score differed significantly between fish held in the Ae and S. C. E. N. E. systems. Egg survival, chorion breaking strength and Se chorion concentrations were higher in eggs produced by broodstock held in the S. C. E. N. E. system compared to those in the Ae system. Alternatively, chorion concentrations of P and K were higher in eggs from fish held in the raceway system. This data highlights the complex interactions between the holding environment and pre-ovulating fish and resultant egg quality. The variation in egg survival in individual Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) reared in the same environment was assessed and used to examine the suitability of chorion measurements as parameters of egg quality. There was a significant difference in the egg survival rates between individual salmon. Results also show that there was also variation in egg survival, chorion breaking strength, chorion elemental concentrations and chorion protein concentrations and profiles between individual Atlantic salmon. Subsequent analysis of the data showed that there was no difference in these egg quality parameters between high and low egg survival rates. Furthermore, there was no correlation between egg survival and the chorion quality parameters recorded during this study. The results show that individual variation between fish is an important factor affecting egg quality. Broodstock Atlantic salmon were fed a standard commercial diet, with or without the addition of a supplemented nutritional mix, which included 0. 5 mg/kg of Sel-plex (organic Se). The Se content of the eggs and livers of each fish were assessed as was egg survival rates and proteomic analysis of the egg chorion. Concentrations of Se in the eggs of the individuals fed the supplemented diet were significantly higher than those fed the non-supplemented diet. However, the egg survival rate was also significantly lower in the supplemented group of fish. The assessment of the chorion protein profile and its proteomic structure was inconclusive. These results support the hypothesis that dietary selenium is vertically transferred to immature eggs during oocyte development. The lack of a linear relationship between Se egg concentrations and egg survival suggests that the lower survival rates of eggs from broodstock fed the supplemented diet in this trial was due to another nutritional component of the diet rather than the Se. Selenium enriched eggs from Atlantic salmon fed a supplemented diet and eggs from conspecifics fed a non-supplemented diet were tested for their ability to resist infection by Saprolegnia under incubation conditions similar to those used by the aquaculture industry. There was no significant difference in the presence/absence of infection, infection rate or survival between eggs produced by Atlantic salmon fed the supplemented and non-supplemented diet. Therefore, it was concluded that supplementation of broodstock diet does not alter the resistance of eggs to Saprolegnia. The presence of adhesive mechanisms on the surface of European whitefish eggs was examined from a population found within Loch Eck, Scotland. European whitefish eggs remain non-adhesive in a solution chemically similar to ovarian fluid, but become adhesive seconds after contact with water. Examination of the ultrastructure of the chorion showed that the morphology altered significantly after contact with water with nodule-like protuberances attached to connective filaments on the surface, present in <b>water</b> <b>hardened</b> but not non-water hardened eggs. Biochemical analysis also showed the presence of Chain A, RNase ZF- 3 e in the chorion of <b>water</b> <b>hardened</b> but not non <b>water</b> <b>hardened</b> eggs.
