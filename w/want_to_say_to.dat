I ask forgiveness for the fact that I didn't justify some of the hopes of those people who believed that with one stroke, one burst, one sign we could jump from the grey, stagnant, totalitarian past to a bright, rich, civilized future. I myself believed this. One burst was not enough... but I want you to know – I've never said this, today it's important for me to tell you: the pain of every one of you, I feel in myself, in my heart... in saying farewell, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> every one of you: be happy. You deserve happiness. You deserve happiness, and peace.|$|E
