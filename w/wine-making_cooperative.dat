2500|$|The German wine {{industry}} consists of many small vineyard owners. The 1999 viticultural survey counted 68 598 vineyard owners, down from 76 683 in Western Germany in 1989/90, {{for an average}} size of 1.5 ha. Most of the 40 625 operators of less than 0.5 ha should likely be classified as hobby winemakers. Many smaller vineyard owners do not pursue viticulture as a full-time occupation, {{but rather as a}} supplement to other agriculture or to hospitality. It is not uncommon for a visitor to a German wine region to find that a small family-owned Gasthaus has its own wine. Smaller grape-growers who do not wish to, or are unable to, commercialise their own wine have several options available: sell the grapes (either on the market each harvest year, or on long-term contract with larger wineries looking to supplement their own production), deliver the grapes to a <b>wine-making</b> <b>cooperative</b> (called Winzergenossenschaft in Germany), or sell the wine in bulk to winemaking firms that use them in [...] "bulk brands" [...] or as a base wine for Sekt. Those who own vineyards in truly good locations also have the option of renting them out to larger producers to operate.|$|E

The {{following}} generations supplied the majority of the grape harvest to neighbouring <b>wine-making</b> <b>cooperatives.</b> The traditional single-varietal Baron Longo wines were produced exclusively for their own consumption from the 1950s up until 2015.|$|R
