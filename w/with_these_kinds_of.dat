[...] As it deals <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> themes, the film was labeled as [...] "violent". In response, Assis said that he [...] "films life as it is". Jose Solis of PopMatters declared that [...] "despite its sorrowful appearance, the film is a celebration of life". Assis tried to contrast the violence depicted by the Hollywood action films with the [...] "small violences" [...] which people face everyday, making it [...] "poetic and violent at the same time". Bloch's character shooting corpses represents [...] "a harmless, symbolic addiction" [...] {{in the same way}} other aspects of the film [...] "come from it, this violence within us".|$|E

Although Entertainment Weekly writer Clark Collis drew parallels to a serial killer, Kirkman suggested this was an initiative to give more screen time to the character. He avouched that Carl was [...] "one of the most fun characters to tell stories about in this world." [...] He continued: [...] "It's true of the comic and it's true of the show. Over time, we’re {{going to start to}} see more and more of this kid. What's awesome about that is, think about {{what it would be like}} to grow up in this world. It's one thing to have everything you know taken away from you and have to deal with this s—y world you now have to live in. But to have barely even really recognized what the world is and how it works and what to expect and then to be thrust into this apocalyptic threat and to grow up and mature <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> situations. It's going to make him grow up weird, is what I like to say." ...|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN gave [...] "Now is Not the End" [...] a {{score of}} 8 out of 10, {{indicating}} a [...] "Great" [...] episode, and praised the titular character, who he thought was [...] "expertly played" [...] by Atwell, {{as well as her}} dynamic with D'Arcy's Jarvis. Goldman felt that the period setting was used well, despite the episode feeling [...] "like a TV show compared to the Marvel movies (being a TV show and all)", and was happy that series was attempting to [...] "entertain on its own merits", rather than try [...] "to add some huge important element to [...] giant overarching storyline". Goldman did feel that Carter needed a more specific villain to fight, but stated that [...] "With only eight episodes, that hopefully will change quickly". Alan Sepinwall at HitFix found that the series had learned from the mistakes of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and stood as its own entity. He praised Atwell's performance, the visual/period style, and D'Arcy as Jarvis, but he felt that Carter's sexist colleagues were cartoonish, saying [...] "not that sexism didn't exist in the era, but that it's a tough thing to dramatize from a modern perspective without feeling winky and smug. It's a dance many period dramas have to do, not always successfully, and while it would be foolish to pretend a woman like Peggy wouldn't have had to deal <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> idiots all the time, Agent Carter is at its liveliest when the three stooges are nowhere to be seen".|$|E

The network confirmed that the series would be [...] "its first venture into the Marvel Cinematic Universe", and described the show as a [...] "superhero love story", a premise that Variety called [...] "a seamless fit for Freeform" [...] given the network's target audience of [...] "Becomers" [...] (the 14-34 age demographic). This younger-skewing content was continued with the comedy series Marvel's New Warriors ordered in April 2017, with Freeform executive Karey Burke saying, Marvel [...] "started to see our strength with young adults and together we could create a pipeline for content that was specific to our audience that felt younger than what they're doing at the other channels... It was important {{to both of us}} to find the right characters that felt like they would speak directly to Freeform's audience. The Avengers wouldn't work here but the about-to-be-Avengers works here." [...] Loeb noted that it was [...] "exciting" [...] to Marvel [...] "to be able to explore the world of the hero and how it affects someone who {{is trying to figure out}} who they are as opposed to already knows who they are and now their whole life has to take a left. That's the journey we're going on <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> characters" [...] in Cloak & Dagger, New Warriors and Hulu's Runaways.

She {{was not allowed to}} mix with other players off the court, was required to exercise in a separate gym, and was under strict guard on her way from the hotel to the court. To add to the pressure, the tournament took place at the time when Dubai authorities were investigating the killing of Hamas military commander Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, which the UAE blamed on Israeli agents, some posing as European tennis fans. Pe'er was widely praised by her fellow competitors for her composure under pressure during the tournament.

Therefore, a combination of variant channel conditions together <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> traffic patterns could cause a performance degradation since the OLLA {{may not be able to}} update its offset fast enough to follow the channel variations.|$|R

Specifically, the skill-acquisition and locking-in effects are especially pronounced <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> measures. <b>These</b> financial transfers, {{especially if they are}} permanent, may create disincentives for unskilled workers to move to a better job and/or enhance their human capital 108. Any resulting payoff in wages from better jobs or training is lower since workers will lose entitlement to (part of) the financial transfers 109. Thus, these measures effectively decrease wage differentials between low-wage work and high-skilled work. Not only will this effect increase the relative number of unskilled workers, who are associated with higher unemployment rates, but it will have significant longer-run effects.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{seismic hazard}} {{assessment}} (SHA) for {{nuclear power plants}} (NPP) contains the so called seismic hazard curve and uniform hazard spectra for mean return periods of earthquakes of up to 10 6 years.
