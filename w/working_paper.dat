25|$|According to a European Commission <b>working</b> <b>paper,</b> {{empirical}} {{studies show that}} the UK stamp duty influences the share prices negatively. More frequently traded shares are stronger affected than low-turnover shares. Therefore, the tax revenue capitalizes at least to some extent in lower current share prices. For firms which rely on equity as marginal source of finance this may increase capital costs since the issue price of new shares would be lower than without the tax.|$|E

25|$|Many {{investment}} funds use leverage, {{the practice}} of borrowing money, trading on margin, or using derivatives to obtain market exposure in excess of that provided by investors' capital. Although leverage can increase potential returns, the opportunity for larger gains is weighed against the possibility of greater losses. Hedge funds employing leverage are {{likely to engage in}} extensive risk management practices. In comparison with investment banks, hedge fund leverage is relatively low; according to a National Bureau of Economic Research <b>working</b> <b>paper,</b> the average leverage for investment banks is 14.2, compared to between 1.5 and 2.5 for hedge funds.|$|E
