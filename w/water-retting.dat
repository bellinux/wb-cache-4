40|$|Abstract. Two pectinase-producing strains, HDYM- 01 and HDYM- 02, {{were added}} into retting tanks to {{accelerate}} the <b>water-retting</b> of flax after they were amplified in liquid medium. The {{results show that the}} yields of fiber flax retted with bacteria addition are higher than the control, and the difference is significant with F test. When reusing the retting water to the next tank to perform the <b>water-retting</b> with bacteria addition, the yields of fiber flax are also higher and the difference is significant with F test. The retting time would be shortened for 24 hr and the flax strength is raised for 20 - 30 Newton (N) with bacteria addition method and reusing retting water method...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{study the}} effect of {{selected}} bacterial strains on hemp <b>water-retting</b> and properties of retted fibre. Methods and Results: The trials were performed in laboratory tanks. The traditional <b>water-retting</b> process, without inoculum addition, was compared to a process modified by inoculating water tanks with two selected pectinolytic bacteria: the anaerobic strain Clostridium sp. L 1 / 6 and the aerobic strain Bacillus sp. ROO 40 B. Six different incubation times were compared. Half the fibre obtained from each tank was combed. Micromorphological analyses were performed by scanning electron microscopy on uncombed and combed fibres. Moreover, organoleptic and chemical analyses of uncombed fibres were performed. Conclusions: The inoculum, besides speeding up the process, significantly improved the fibre quality. The fibre was not damaged by mechanical hackling, thanks to the good retting level obtained {{by the addition of}} selected strains, differently to what happened with the traditionally retted fibre. The best fibre quality was obtained after 3 - 4 days of retting with the addition of the bacterial inoculum. Significance and Impact of the Study: Retting is the major limitation to an efficient production of high-quality hemp fibres. The <b>water-retting</b> process and fibre quality were substantially improved by simultaneously inoculating water tanks with two selected pectinolytic strains...|$|E
40|$|International audienceNatural fibres such as hemp are {{extensively}} used in new composite materials. This article {{deals with}} biological and mechanical aspects of hemp phloem fibres. The effects of different cultural parameters on some characteristics of hemp fibres were studied: variety, soil drought during plant cultivation and <b>water-retting</b> process. Results {{showed that there}} was no significant influence on studied properties of the hemp variety and of <b>water-retting.</b> Under water-limited conditions, results showed that plant growth was reduced and the maturation of phloem fibres was delayed. Secondary cell wall was synthesised later in comparison with water-controlled conditions and cell protoplast remains longer. These biological aspects can be related to the higher Young's modulus and maximal stress values measured on fibre strands from plants grown under water-stressed conditions. These results are promising, by considering the extent and degree of drought conditions in the world...|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally the hemp stalks {{would be}} <b>water-retted</b> first before the fibers were beaten off the inner hurd by hand; {{a process known}} as scutching. As {{mechanical}} technology evolved, separating the fiber from the core was accomplished by crushing rollers and brush rollers that would produce a nearly clean fiber. After the Marijuana Tax Act was implemented in 1938, the technology for separating the fibers from the core remained [...] "frozen in time".|$|R
50|$|This is {{a common}} method in areas with limited water resources. It is most {{effective}} in climates with heavy night time dews and warm daytime temperatures. The harvested plant stalks are spread evenly in grassy fields, where the combined action of bacteria, sun, air, and dew produces fermentation, dissolving much of the stem material surrounding the fibre bundles. Within two to three weeks, depending upon climatic conditions, the fibre can be separated. Dew-retted fibre is generally darker in color and of poorer quality than <b>water-retted</b> fibre.|$|R
40|$|In some late years {{a number}} of fibre flax {{varieties}} and new breeding lines have been created and investigated at the Upytė Research Station of Lithuanian Institute of Agriculture (LIA). The fibre quality parameters of the new varieties of fibre flax are studied and {{compared with those of}} standard flax varieties. Flax was pulled at the stage of early yellow ripeness, warm <b>water-retted,</b> threshed, scutched and hackled. Long fibre content was calculated from the dry mass of unretted straw. Fibre quality’s parameters of some flax varieties (“Belinka ” (standard), “Baltučiai”, “Ariane”) and new breeding lines (No. 01057 - 12, No. 1698 - 13 a, No. 1864 - 24, No. 1963 - 3) grown in 2001 – 2003 are investigated. The main properties of flax fibre as fineness, flexibility, and tensile strength are measured, and the data obtained by common methods and some new modern methods are compared. The flax varieties producing the fibre of higher qualities are revealed...|$|R
40|$|Environmental changes {{discussed}} {{in an earlier}} work using pollen, sedimentology, ostracods and charcoal proxies were evaluated with new non-pollen palynomorph data. The limits of non-pollen palynomorph biozones {{are consistent with the}} main environmental changes reported earlier in the Pre-Pyrenean Lake Estanya. The non-pollen palynomorph diagram from Lake Estanya Gran shows that changes in human activity during the last 2000  years are reflected in lake responses. Palaeoecological data from non-pollen palynomorphs have helped to determine the causes of these environmental changes, e. g. the lake use for hemp <b>water-retting</b> and its limnological impacts. The main change in the non-pollen palynomorph diagram is the expansion of Desmidiaceae, indicating more acid water conditions between 1220 AD and 1760 AD. The onset of Desmidiaceae in 1220 AD may be attributed to the development of farming and probably to the construction of water channels. Desmidiaceae undergo a considerable decline after 1760 AD, coinciding with the fall in hemp production in the XVIIIth century. Consequently, the lake water recovered the oligotrophic status that had prevailed before 1220 AD. The perturbation caused by the introduction of hemp retting practices in Lake Estanya led to changes in all the proxies such as sedimentology, non-pollen palynomorphs, pollen and faunal communities. © 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{authors have}} {{investigated}} a new utilizationof rice-hull from a viewpoint of the recycling. The rice-hull carbon-material (RHS carbon) is manufactured by mixing the rice-hull particles with a phenol resin, pressure forming, drying, and then carbonizing in the temperature range from 1173 K to 1773 K. Since {{the most of}} the inorganic component is Siin the rice hull, {{the most of the}} produced inorganic component in the RHS carbon is SiO 2, which is stable under wet or <b>water-ret</b> conditions. Therefore, the RHS carbon {{is expected to be a}} high water-resistant material. In this study, the authors measure the compressive strength of the RHS carbon after water immersing and hygroscopic expansion in a deionized water. The compressive strength did not decrease after the water immersing. Moreover, the hygroscopic expansion of the RHS carbon was considerably low. These results clearly showed the advantage of the RHS carbon, comparing to the similar porous carbon materials made from rice bran...|$|R
40|$|Fibers from flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) are {{stiff and}} strong and can be blended with other short staple fibers, such as cotton (Gossypium barbadense L. or Gossypium hirsutum L.), {{processed}} into a yarn and then manufactured into a fabric. Manufacturing yarns with natural flax fibers has traditionally been constructed using dew- or <b>water-retted</b> fibers. Enzyme-retting is a new, experimental method that decomposes the pectinaceous and matrix substances to separate cellulose fibers from shives using pectinase-rich enzymes and chelators. Modifications of the natural hydrophilic fibers cause changes in the fiber and yarn strength depending upon the enzyme treatment. Spinning tests {{were used to determine}} how well fibers were assembled to form yarn and provided an indirect measurement of fiber properties. Fibers were evaluated for physical properties while yarns created with flax and cotton fibers were tested for strength and evenness. Properties of yarns vary considerably but these properties and spinning efficiency remain the top indicators to determine the best enzyme formulation for yarn production. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate miniature spinning using 50 / 50 blends of cotton and enzyme-retted flax since enzyme modifications and chelators impact the fiber and yar...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} an investigation on the compressive strength properties of kenaf fiber composite mortar. <b>Water–retted</b> kenaf fibers were used as reinforcement in cement mortar. Fiber contents of 1 %, 2 % and 3 % (by weight of cement) with varying lengths of 10 mm, 20 mm and 30 mm were used to produce 50 mm mortar cubes. The Composite mortars were cured in water for 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. A total of 150 mortar cubes {{were used for the}} study. Density, water absorption and compressive strength tests were conducted on the composite mortar. Regression analysis was carried out on the compressive strength results using Minitab 15. The results showed that water absorption and density of the composite mortar increased as the volume of fiber and length increased. Compressive strength decreased with increasing fiber volume and length. However, there was increase in compressive strength of between 0. 21 %- 22. 3 % for composite mortar containing 1 - 3 % volume of fiber with 10 mm fiber length. The fitted regression model showed a perfect relationship (R 2 = 84. 5 %) between compressive strength, fiber volume, fiber length and curing age. Therefore, fiber volume, fiber length and curing are useful predictors of the selected model. Model adequacy test reveals that the fitted regression model is highly adequate. There was no statistically significant difference in the compressive strength of the control samples and those containing 1 - 3 % fiber volumes with fiber length of 10 mm...|$|R
