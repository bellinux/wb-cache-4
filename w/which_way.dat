5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Blatty worked {{as the public}} {{relations}} director at Loyola University of Los Angeles and as a publicity director at the University of Southern California. He published his first book, <b>Which</b> <b>Way</b> to Mecca, Jack? in 1960, a humorous look at both his early life, and {{his work at the}} United States Information Agency in Lebanon. In 1961, while still working in public relations, Blatty appeared as a contestant on the Groucho Marx quiz show You Bet Your Life, winning $10,000, enough money to quit his job and to write full-time. Thereafter, he never held a regular job.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to Simonsohn's critical analyses of their earlier methods, Pelham and Carvallo published {{a new study}} in 2015, describing how they now controlled for gender, ethnicity, and education confounds. In one study they looked at census data and concluded that men disproportionately worked in eleven occupations that matched their surnames, for example, Baker, Carpenter, and Farmer, something theNew Scientisthas coinednominative determinism. Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami investigated <b>which</b> <b>way</b> the arrow of causality points {{when it comes to}} names influencing choice of occupation.

5|$|Initial {{writing for}} the first season was split between the Wachowskis and Straczynski. The Wachowskis wrote episodes one, two, three, seven and eight while Straczynski wrote episodes four, five, six, nine and ten. Then the Wachowskis rewrote Straczynski's scripts and vice versa. Straczynski said {{a good portion of}} the writing was done by just Lana and himself. Straczynski {{believes}} writing with the Wachowskis helped mask each other's weaknesses and also allowed each party to learn from the other. He recognizes action and plot as their biggest strengths but structure as their weakness. On the other hand, he views himself as really good on structure but weak on action. Straczynski said the way he works is by first developing the entire script in his head, from the first sentence to the last, before sitting down to write it, while the Wachowskis begin by writing the scenes they have already developed, leaving the others they haven't figured out yet for later, while they constantly move the pieces around to see in <b>which</b> <b>way</b> they work best.|$|E
5|$|Meena takes Rahul to {{her father}} and {{introduces}} him as her lover. Tangaballi challenges Rahul to a duel that Rahul unknowingly accepts, due to his lack of knowledge in Tamil. On {{the night of the}} duel, Rahul escapes {{with the help of a}} local policeman, Shamsher (Mukesh Tiwari), but he ends up on a ship with Sri Lankan terrorists and smugglers. A gun battle ensues between the police force and the terrorists. When the police officers investigate and take Rahul into custody, he tells his story and ends up back in Komban. Terrified and once again surrounded by Azhagusundaram's sickle-wielding henchmen, Rahul pretends to take Meena hostage and escapes with her in her father's car, battling Azhagasundaram's men. When the car breaks down, Rahul and Meena quarrel and part ways. Rahul, not knowing <b>which</b> <b>way</b> to go, returns to Meena, who takes him to the Vidhamba village. Meena tells the villagers that they are a married couple who needs protection and rest, to which the villagers agree.|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of the thesis is to provide new data about trans identity formation and trans sex work in Hawai i, while simultaneously critically discussing everyday performances of heteronormative gender identity through exploring their subjective experiences. Thus, the thesis intends to contribute both empirically and analytically to the research field of gender and sexuality, trans and sex work research in particular, considering the following questions: 	How do trans stories and story telling work to reproduce and problematize heteronormativity, and influence subject formation? In <b>which</b> <b>ways</b> do they invoke a temporality of a present and a future? What do the stories tell us about which bodies matter? 	In <b>which</b> <b>ways</b> do Hawaiian trans sex work reproduce and problematize stereotypes of sex work and sex workers? How does the sex worker identity interact with the trans identity, and how do other types of work come into play? How are non- normative bodies like the trans sex worker body sanctioned by society and state institutions? 	How do Hawaiian trans sex workers navigate the complications inherent in passing? How does the discourse of heteronormativity affect self-perception and produce particular notions of gender amongst trans sex workers? In <b>which</b> <b>ways</b> do gender norms regulate the trans body {{into the role of}} the freak? In <b>which</b> <b>ways</b> is passing, i. e., the quest for womanhood, both a threat to the well being of trans sex workers, and concomitantly an indispensible necessity for their survival...|$|R

5|$|The normal {{reaction}} of a prey animal to an attacking predator is to flee by any available means, whether flying, gliding, falling, swimming, running, jumping, burrowing or rolling, {{according to the}} animal's capabilities. Escape paths are often erratic, {{making it difficult for}} the predator to predict <b>which</b> <b>way</b> the prey will go next: for example, birds such as snipe, ptarmigan and black-headed gulls evade fast raptors such as peregrine falcons with zigzagging or jinking flight. In the tropical rain forests of Southeast Asia in particular, many vertebrates escape predators by falling and gliding. Among the insects, many moths turn sharply, fall, or perform a powered dive in response to the sonar clicks of bats. Among fish, the stickleback follows a zigzagging path, often doubling back erratically, when chased by a fish-eating merganser duck.|$|E
5|$|In 1829, {{at the age}} of 15, Colt {{began working}} in his father's textile plant in Ware, Massachusetts, where he had access to tools, materials, and the factory workers' expertise. Following the encyclopedia, Samuel built a {{homemade}} galvanic cell and advertised as a Fourth of July event in that year that he would blow up a raft on Ware Pond using underwater explosives; although the raft was missed, the explosion was still impressive. Sent to boarding school, he amused his classmates with pyrotechnics. In 1830, a July 4 accident caused a fire that ended his schooling, and his father sent him off to learn the seaman's trade. On a voyage to Calcutta on board the brig Corvo, he noticed that regardless of <b>which</b> <b>way</b> the ship's wheel was spun, each spoke always came in direct line with a clutch that could be set to hold it. He later said that this gave him the idea for the revolver. On the Corvo, Colt made a wooden model of a pepperbox revolver out of scrap wood. It differed from other pepperbox revolvers at the time in that it would allow the shooter to rotate the cylinder by the action of cocking the hammer with an attached pawl turning the cylinder which is then locked firmly in alignment with one of the barrels by a bolt, a great improvement over the pepperbox designs which required rotating the barrels by hand and hoping for proper indexing and alignment.|$|E
