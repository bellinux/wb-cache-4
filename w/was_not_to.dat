5|$|According to Ovid, Myrrha was the {{daughter}} of King Cinyras and Queen Cenchreis of Cyprus. It is stated that Cupid <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> blame for Myrrha's incestuous love for her father, Cinyras. Ovid further comments that hating one's father is a crime, but Myrrha's love was a greater crime. Ovid therefore blamed it on the Furies.|$|E
5|$|At the {{completion}} of his contract following the 2016–17 season, Schroeder as a restricted free agent <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be tendered a new contract with the Wild. Approaching his free agent status, Schroeder was traded by the Wild to the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for Dante Salituro on June 23, 2017. He was later signed by the Blue Jackets to avoid free agency with a two-year contract on June 27, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Bletchley {{had fought}} {{to be the}} centre of the {{proposed}} new city, but it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be. The 1971 Plan for Milton Keynes placed Central Milton Keynes on a completely new hill-top site four miles further north, half way to Wolverton. Bletchley was relegated to the status of suburb.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} of Chalcedon, {{it was agreed that}} monasteries <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> erected without the leave of the bishop; monks were to receive due honour, but <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> mix {{themselves}} up with the affairs of Church or State. They were to be subject to the bishop, etc. (can.iv). Clerics and monks <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> serve in war or embrace a secular life (can.vii).

5|$|Brudenell's first {{action on}} leaving Oxford <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> take his {{parliamentary}} seat but, as was traditional for wealthy {{young men of}} the time, to take the Grand Tour. His itinerary, with Russia and Sweden included, was more extensive than the traditional destinations of France and Italy. The trip allowed Brudenell to enjoy the full pleasures of both cultural and social opportunities afforded by the countries he visited.|$|E
5|$|During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Kursura {{operated}} in the Arabian Sea. She {{was given the}} patrol duties at two designated areas before the war started, but was ordered to operate under two restrictions: she <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> cross demarcated shipping corridors and she could attack a target only after positive identification. The aims of her patrol were to sink any Pakistani naval warships, to sink merchant shipping when specifically ordered, and to conduct general patrol and surveillance.|$|E
5|$|In addition, this marriage, {{which was}} {{endorsed}} by Emperor Justinian himself, marked Germanus out as the heir to both the East Roman and the Gothic realms. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be, however: only {{two days before the}} army was to set out, in the early autumn of 550, he fell ill and died. His demise dashed any hopes for the reconciliation of Goth and Roman in Italy, and led to further years of bloodshed, until the peninsula was definitively conquered by the Byzantines.|$|E

60|$|Law {{is either}} archic[107] (of direction), meristic (of division), or critic (of judgment).

Meristic law is that of balance and distribution: it defines what <b>is</b> and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> possessed. Critic law is that of discernment and award: it defines what <b>is</b> and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> suffered.|$|R
5|$|In his {{monograph}} Project Apollo: The Tough Decisions, Deputy Administrator Seamans {{wrote that}} NASA's single worst mistake in engineering judgment <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> run a fire test on the Command Module before the plugs-out test. In {{the first episode}} of the 2009 BBC documentary series NASA: Triumph and Tragedy, Jim McDivitt said that NASA {{had no idea how}} a 100% oxygen atmosphere would influence burning. Similar remarks by other astronauts were expressed in the 2007 documentary film In the Shadow of the Moon.|$|E

5|$|In short, the Wrights {{discovered}} the true {{purpose of the}} movable vertical rudder. Its role <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> change the direction of flight (as a rudder does in sailing), but rather, to aim or align the aircraft correctly during banking turns and when leveling off from turns and wind disturbances. The actual turn—the change in direction—was done with roll control using wing-warping. The principles remained the same when ailerons superseded wing-warping.|$|E

5|$|Jayakumar {{said that}} while the Government {{recognized}} that the subjective test enhanced the potential for abuse of executive discretion under the ISA, the best safeguard against such abuse of power <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> give the courts powers of judicial review because an unscrupulous government could still tamper with the composition of the courts to impair this judicial check. Instead, the crucial safeguard was for the electorate to make wise voting choices to put an honest and incorruptible government into power.|$|E

On 18 September 1947 he was consecrated a bishop in his family's parish church in Tourcoing by Achille Liénart (who had previously ordained him a priest); acting as co-consecrators were Bishop Jean-Baptiste Fauret, C.S.Sp. and Bishop Alfred-Jean-Félix Ancel.|$|E

Once the enemy strength was judged to have been reduced sufficiently, the fleets closed in, the ships grappled each other, and the marines and upper bank oarsmen boarded the enemy vessel and engaged in hand-to-hand combat.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days later}} Lord Kenmare (who {{had not been}} in Dublin at the time) denied that he had given the least {{authority}} to any person to make any such statement in his name.
