5|$|As omnivores, Campbell's dwarf hamsters eat {{a variety}} of {{different}} foods. A balanced diet for a hamster consists of 16-24% protein, 60-65% carbohydrates, and 5–7% fat, with constant access to fresh water. In their natural habitats, dwarf hamsters feed almost exclusively on plant materials. In captivity, Campbell's dwarf hamsters can get the required nutrition from commercially available food designed specifically for hamsters, <b>which</b> <b>typically</b> contain a mix of dry grains, nuts, and seeds that may be fortified with vitamins and minerals. An excess of any one particular seed or nut can lead to digestive problems, obesity, and forms nutritional deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2004 college {{football}} season, the Atlantic Coast Conference determined its champion via round-robin play {{during the course}} of the regular season and there was no conference championship game. In 2004, the Atlantic Coast conference added two teams—Virginia Tech and Miami—expanding the league to 11 teams. At the time, {{college football}} teams were limited by the NCAA to 11regular-season games, three or four of <b>which</b> <b>typically</b> featured teams outside the home team's conference. Following the 2004season, the league added a 12th team—Boston College—and became eligible to hold a championship game at the conclusion of the 2005 season.|$|E

For just {{the first nine months of}} 2001, Enron reported $138.7 billion in revenues, which placed the company at the sixth position on the Fortune Global 500.|$|E

5|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} {{at the age}} of six to seven years, while males become sexually mature at about 10 years old. The {{gestation}} period is around 15–16 months. The calf, <b>which</b> <b>typically</b> weighs , is weaned after about 15 months and stays with its mother for the first two to three years of its life. In the wild, the birth interval for this species is estimated to be four to five years; its natural offspring-rearing behavior is unstudied.|$|E
5|$|In animals, {{amino acids}} are {{obtained}} through {{the consumption of}} foods containing protein. Ingested proteins are then broken down into amino acids through digestion, <b>which</b> <b>typically</b> involves denaturation of the protein through exposure to acid and hydrolysis by enzymes called proteases. Some ingested amino acids are used for protein biosynthesis, while others are converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis, or fed into the citric acid cycle. This use of protein as a fuel is particularly important under starvation conditions as it allows the body's own proteins {{to be used to}} support life, particularly those found in muscle.|$|E
5|$|Located at the {{southern}} periphery of a subtropical ridge, Iniki continued westward and strengthened over the unusually favorable central Pacific; it reached hurricane status on September 9 while 470miles (760km) south-southeast of Hilo. The subtropical ridge, <b>which</b> <b>typically</b> keeps hurricanes {{well away from the}} Hawaiian Islands, weakened due to an approaching upper level-trough and allowed Iniki to turn to the northwest. With very favorable upper-level outflow and warm water temperatures, Iniki steadily intensified, and attained major hurricane status on September 10 while south-southwest of the island chain.|$|E

A one-year General Management program is offered through virtual classroom. As a combined initiative with the Ministry of Defence, a six-month General Management Programme is conducted for Defence officers to assist their career transition to the corporate sector.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the points}} of {{interest}} of the English cathedrals {{is the way in}} which much of the history of medieval architecture can be demonstrated within a single building, <b>which</b> <b>typically</b> has important parts constructed in several different centuries with no attempt whatever to make the later work match or follow through on an earlier plan. For this reason a comprehensive architectural chronology must jump backwards and forwards from one building to another. Only at one building, Salisbury Cathedral, is stylistic unity demonstrated.|$|E
5|$|Some brewers add {{one or more}} {{clarifying}} {{agents to}} beer, <b>which</b> <b>typically</b> precipitate (collect as a solid) out of the beer along with protein solids and are found only in trace amounts in the finished product.

5|$|The phase-amplitude {{converter}} {{creates the}} sample-domain waveform from the truncated phase output word {{received from the}} PA. The PAC can be a simple read only memory containing 2M contiguous samples of the desired output waveform <b>which</b> <b>typically</b> is a sinusoid. Often though, various tricks are employed {{to reduce the amount}} of memory required. This include various trigonometric expansions, trigonometric approximations and methods which take advantage of the quadrature symmetry exhibited by sinusoids. Alternatively, the PAC may consist of random access memory which can be filled as desired to create an arbitrary waveform generator.|$|E
5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} dependence {{occurs in}} {{about one-third of}} individuals who are treated with benzodiazepines for longer than 4 weeks, <b>which</b> <b>typically</b> results in tolerance and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome when the dose is reduced too rapidly. Midazolam infusions may induce tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome {{in a matter of}} days. The risk factors for dependence include dependent personality, use of a benzodiazepine that is short-acting, high potency and long-term use of benzodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms from midazolam can range from insomnia and anxiety to seizures and psychosis. Withdrawal symptoms can sometimes resemble a person’s underlying condition. Gradual reduction of midazolam after regular use can minimise withdrawal and rebound effects. Tolerance and the resultant withdrawal syndrome may be due to receptor down-regulation and GABAA receptor alterations in gene expression, which causes long-term changes in the function of the GABAergic neuronal system.|$|E

5|$|About {{twelve hours}} after {{reaching}} typhoon status, Oliwa began to undergo unexpected explosive deepening. In a 24‑hour period, the JTWC assessed the typhoon as nearly doubling in intensity, from 85 to 160mph (140 to 260km/h 1-min winds), while the pressure dropped 69mbar {{to a minimum}} of 898mbar; based on the estimated intensity, the JTWC classified Oliwa as a super typhoon. The JMA, which is the official agency of the western Pacific, assessed Oliwa as reaching a peak of 115mph (185km/h 10-min winds), with a pressure of 915mbar. Around that time, satellite imagery indicated a possible eyewall mesovorticy, which is a small scale rotational feature found in the eyewall of an intense tropical cyclone.

Thüringen {{and the rest of the}} fleet then fell into a pattern of individual ship, squadron, and full fleet exercises over the next two years.
