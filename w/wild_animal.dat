5|$|Level Mountain can be ecologically {{divided into}} three sections: an alpine climate at its summit, a largely {{destroyed}} Abies lasiocarpa forest on its flanks and a Picea glauca forest at its base.

An outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1999 was traced back to pigs becoming ill after contact with fruit-eating flying foxes, their faeces and urine. The pigs in turn passed the infection to humans. Avian flu H5N1 is present in wild bird populations and can be carried large distances by migrating birds. This virus is easily transmissible to domestic poultry, and to humans living in close proximity with them. Other infectious diseases affecting wild animals, farm animals and humans include rabies, leptospirosis, brucellosis, tuberculosis and trichinosis.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with the}} album Blood Fire Death, {{one of the}} first {{definitive}} Viking metal releases, Bathory incorporated a diverse range of musical elements. While retaining the noise and chaos of previous recordings, the band took a more sorrowful and melodic approach, working in ballads based on Germanic and Norse folklore, shanty-like melodies and folk music elements such as bourdon sounds, Jew's harps, and fifes. Bathory added natural found sounds, such as ocean waves, thunder, and <b>wild</b> <b>animal</b> noises, in a style similar to that of musique concrète. Instruments were sometimes used to create onomatopoeic effects such as drum sounds imitating thunder or a sledgehammer. The songs typically featured multi-sectional formal structures, following a pattern of three instrumental sections– introduction, bridge, and finale– and two vocal sections– stanza and refrain.|$|E
5|$|The Maryland herd, {{often called}} the Assateague herd, is owned and managed by the National Park Service. The Maryland herd is one of very few free-ranging wild horse populations left in the United States.

40|$|A {{combination}} of animal welfare law and nature conservation law establishes {{a hierarchy of}} protection for <b>wild</b> <b>animals,</b> with rare, threatened or endangered native animals receiving {{the highest levels of}} protection, plentiful native animals lying in the middle - sometimes wellprotected, sometimes not - and introduced <b>wild</b> <b>animals</b> at the bottom. In reading beyond the accounts of contemporary law, especially in sociology and environmental history, a plausible argument can be made for the proposition that this prevailing general schema of protection refl ects an early 20 th century assertion of a distinctive Australian identity, combined with the emergence of a conservation ethic and the decline of attempts to acclimatise British <b>wild</b> <b>animals</b> in Australia. Prior to federation the legal protection of <b>wild</b> <b>animals</b> was quite different, with native animals receiving little protection until the late 19 th century.

5|$|In the European Union, animal {{sources are}} governed by Council Directive 86/609/EEC, which {{requires}} lab animals to be specially bred, unless the animal has been lawfully imported {{and is not a}} <b>wild</b> <b>animal</b> or a stray.

The United States also allows the use of wild-caught primates; between 1995 and 1999, 1,580 wild baboons were imported into the U.S. Over half the primates imported between 1995 and 2000 were handled by Charles River Laboratories, or by Covance, which is the single largest importer of primates into the U.S.|$|E

Konkani plays, {{especially}} religious ones, were written and staged in Mangalore in the 20th century by prominent playwrights such as Pedru John D'Souza, Pascal Sequeira and Bonaventure Tauro. The Ghumat was a popular musical instrument played especially during weddings. The instrument has {{the form of an}} earthen pot but is open at both sides. One end is covered with the skin of some <b>wild</b> <b>animal,</b> and the other is left open. The traditional theatre form is called Gumat, and is performed {{on the eve of the}} marriage or in connection with the marriage celebrations in the decorated pandal (stage). The play is conducted by males belonging to both the brides' and bridegrooms' parties, and usually takes place for two or three nights. The plays performed are usually those of Biblical stories, and their morals are presented with the purpose of educating the bride and bridegroom. This tradition has almost completely died out among the present generation.|$|E

40|$|Domestication {{is known}} to have {{increased}} <b>animal</b> morbidity. <b>Wild</b> <b>animals,</b> however, should not be looked upon romantically like Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s “noble sauvage”, untainted by civilisation. Rare pathological lesions found on the bones of <b>wild</b> <b>animals</b> in archaeozoological assemblages, they offer valuable information both from a zoological and a archaeological point of view.

A simple classification, specifically developed for <b>wild</b> <b>animals,</b> is presented that helps better understand these conditions.

5|$|Some {{versions}} of the myth provide Set's motive for killing Osiris. According to a spell in the Pyramid Texts, Set is taking revenge for a kick Osiris gave him, whereas in a Late Period text, Set's grievance is that Osiris had sex with Nephthys, who is Set's consort and the fourth child of Geb and Nut. The murder itself is frequently alluded to, but never clearly described. The Egyptians believed that written words {{had the power to}} affect reality, so they avoided writing directly about profoundly negative events such as Osiris's death. Sometimes they denied his death altogether, even though the bulk of the traditions about him make it clear that he has been murdered. In some cases the texts suggest that Set {{takes the form of a}} <b>wild</b> <b>animal,</b> such as a crocodile or bull, to slay Osiris; in others they imply that Osiris's corpse is thrown in the water or that he is drowned. This latter tradition is the origin of the Egyptian belief that people who had drowned in the Nile were sacred. Even the identity of the victim is changeable in texts, as it is sometimes the god Haroeris, an elder form of Horus, who is murdered by Set and then avenged by another form of Horus, who is Haroeris's son by Isis.|$|E
5|$|Thus, Palmer {{argues that}} humans are not {{normally}} required to aid wild animals in need. The philosopher Joel MacClellan, a critic of intervention, challenges Palmer on three grounds: first, {{he says that the}} difference between our obligations to domestic and wild animals in Palmer's thought experiments could be justified on scientific, rather than moral, grounds; second, he challenges Palmer's characterisation of wildness as a relationship, rather than a capacity, arguing that a description of an animal as wild likely conveys that the animal has certain capacities lacked by domestic animals; and, third, he suggests that just as a utilitarian approach to <b>wild</b> <b>animal</b> suffering may demand too much, Palmer's contextual approach may permit too much, by allowing the policing of nature. The affinities between utilitarian and contextualist approaches, MacClellan argues, come from their shared idea of what is and is not valuable. The pro-intervention philosopher Catia Faria criticises Palmer's argument from the other direction. Faria challenges Palmer's account by pointing to the counter-intuitive conclusions it would reach, Faria claims, in cases of assisting humans with whom an individual does not have significant relationships. Unless Palmer is willing to deny that humans have obligations to help suffering distant humans, Faria argues, the account cannot justify not aiding animals.|$|E
5|$|Wild tigers {{that have}} had no prior contact with humans {{actively}} avoid interactions with humans. However, tigers cause more human deaths through direct attack than any other wild mammal. Attacks are occasionally provoked, as tigers lash out after being injured while they themselves are hunted. Attacks can be provoked accidentally, as when a human surprises a tiger or inadvertently comes between {{a mother and her}} young, or as in a case in rural India when a postman startled a tiger, used to seeing him on foot, by riding a bicycle. Occasionally tigers come to view people as prey. Such attacks are most common in areas where population growth, logging, and farming have put pressure on tiger habitats and reduced their wild prey. Most man-eating tigers are old, missing teeth, and unable to capture their preferred prey. For example, the Champawat Tiger, a tigress found in Nepal and then India, had two broken canines. She was responsible for an estimated 430 human deaths, the most attacks known to be perpetrated by a single <b>wild</b> <b>animal,</b> {{by the time she was}} shot in 1907 by Jim Corbett. According to Corbett, tiger attacks on humans are normally in daytime, when people are working outdoors and are not keeping watch. Early writings tend to describe man-eating tigers as cowardly because of their ambush tactics.|$|E
