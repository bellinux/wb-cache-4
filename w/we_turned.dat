500|$|England had wins against Southern Hemisphere {{teams in}} the 1970s; with {{victories}} over South Africa in 1972, New Zealand in 1973 and Australia in 1973 and 1976. The 1972 Five Nations Championship was not completed due to the Troubles in Northern Ireland when Scotland and Wales refused to play their Five Nations away fixtures in Ireland. England played in Dublin in 1973 and were given a standing ovation lasting five minutes. After losing 18–9 at Lansdowne Road, the England captain, John Pullin famously stated, [...] "We might not be very good but at least <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> up." ...|$|E
500|$|... "We {{came up with}} a {{narrative}} device to really explore Walter's feelings. We had largely all the elements of the episode in place and Fox called and said, 'Hey, how would you guys feel about if we asked you to have some musical element in the show? Anything, like just feature a song playing.' They didn't ask us to do Glee. And we instantly, before we got off the phone, said, 'Well, this is what we're thinking for the episode and here's an idea how that could work for us.' <b>We</b> <b>turned</b> their request into what felt like a positive for us and really deepened and sort of blew the episode out even further in the direction we were already taking it".|$|E
500|$|..... <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> off {{the dusty}} French road, through a gateway {{and into a}} meadow beside the {{buildings}} of a farm. I saw {{with one of the}} nastiest feelings I have ever had in my life two heavy machine guns inside the meadow ... pointing at the head of our column. The guns began to spit fire ... for a few seconds the cries and shrieks of our stricken men drowned the crackling of the guns. Men fell like grass before a scythe ... I felt a searing pain and pitched forward ... my scream of pain mingled with the cries of my mates, but even before I fell into the heap of dying men, the thought stabbed my brain 'If I ever get out of here, the swine that did this will pay for it.' ...|$|E

500|$|Beatrice {{left home}} when Mills {{was nine years}} old, which left her, her older brother Shane, and her younger sister, Fiona, {{in the care of}} their father. Mills said that her father once threw her brother against a window for making a mess on the carpet with crayons. The window broke and her brother had to be taken to hospital, where their father {{explained}} that the boy had fallen on some glass in the garden. Fiona said: [...] "Our family were always short of money and our father demanded that we find food and clothes so <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> to shoplifting, learnt to hide from the bailiffs and became experts at domestic duties. I'm not ashamed to say that we were forced to steal because when you are a young child, you'd rather do that than face a beating from your father". (Their father disputed his daughters' allegations that he was violent towards them, later releasing home movies of family holidays in Wales, showing Mills playing happily.) ...|$|E
500|$|Filming {{involving}} the reptiles frequently {{proved to be}} hazardous. During a promotional shoot with Supermarionation puppets, one of the crocodiles suddenly grabbed the Lady Penelope marionette (which {{does not appear in}} the episode) and, to the upset of Glanville, ripped apart one the legs. During the filming of a scene in which an alligator swims after a boat, Meddings was using a rope to guide the crocodile forwards when it was discovered that the animal had slipped out of its harness; in his book, 21st–Century Visions, Meddings wrote of the incident: [...] "My crew never saw me move as fast as I did {{to get out of the}} tank when I pulled the rope and realised the creature was free." [...] Of the largest crocodile, which was wetted with damp strips at the back of the stage while un-used, Wingrove recalls: [...] "You would forget that it was there, then one day someone shouted 'Look out!' and <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> round to see this big crocodile walking across the stage – which cleared of people very quickly!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{responsible}} for the naming of the musical subgenre raga rock, when journalist Sally Kempton, in her review of the single for The Village Voice, used the term to describe the record's experimental fusion of eastern and western music. [...] However, although Kempton {{was the first person to}} use the term raga rock in print, she had actually borrowed the phrase from the promotional material that the Byrds' press office had supplied to accompany the [...] "Eight Miles High" [...] single release. [...] In a 1968 interview for the Pop Chronicles radio documentary, McGuinn denied that the song was in fact an example of raga rock, while Crosby, speaking in 1998, dismissed the term entirely, stating [...] "they kept trying to label us; every time <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> around, they came up with a new one ... it's a bunch of bullshit." [...] Nonetheless, the experimental nature of the song placed the Byrds firmly at the forefront of the burgeoning psychedelic movement, along with the Yardbirds, the Beatles, Donovan and the Rolling Stones, who were all exploring similar musical territory concurrently.|$|E

500|$|To {{direct the}} play, the duo engaged Harold Clurman, noted {{for his work}} in drama and {{one of the founders of}} the Group Theatre. Jo Mielziner, veteran of several Rodgers and Hammerstein productions, was the stage designer. In {{contrast}} to the complex staging of Me and Juliet, Mielziner's sets were uncomplicated, a system of house-frame outlines in front of backdrops representing Monterey. Boris Runanin was the choreographer, Robert Russell Bennett provided orchestrations, and Salvatore Dell'Isola conducted. The two producers had hoped to hire the prestigious Majestic Theatre, where South Pacific had run, but the writing process took too long, and the Majestic was lost to Fanny. Instead, they booked the Shubert Theatre, in the top rank of Broadway theatres, but not as prestigious as the Majestic. Uniquely for their joint work, they solicited no backers, but underwrote the entire cost themselves. Feuer later said of the bargain he and Martin had made with Rodgers and Hammerstein, [...] "And the deal was pretty good: 50percent of the producers' end. And we thought, We're rich! And <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> it over to them and they destroyed it." ...|$|E
2500|$|While McGraw pitched {{sparingly}} in the 1969 post season, {{he remembered}} the year quite fondly, saying, [...] "Everything changed for me in 1969, the year <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> out to be goddamned amazing, all right." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{several days}} of routine duties, on 4 August 1944 the crew found German human torpedo with a damaged rudder and pilot dead. [...] Ted Guzda recalled, [...] "The Germans used to have these one-man subs and we caught one but didn’t take it aboard, <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> it over to an English ship." ...|$|E
2500|$|The river {{took many}} turns, {{so that it}} was a burden the continual turning about.... West, east, and north <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> on that same meadow and progressed none, so that I, rising in the boat, saw the river flowing just across a bit of grass, in a place where I knew we had passed through nigh an hour before. [...] "Moore," [...] said Miles then to me, [...] "the river is like its Master, our good King Charles, of sainted memory, it {{promises}} overmuch, but gets you nowhere." ...|$|E

2500|$|Souter {{disagreed}} with the majority's reading of Bowen, saying in that case [...] "we already had found the statute valid on its face before <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> to the taxpayers' as-applied challenge...so the case cannot be read to hold that taxpayers have standing only to claim that congressional action, but not its implementation, violates the Establishment Clause." [...] Therefore after Bowen, the majority opinion's [...] "distinction between a 'congressional mandate' {{on the one hand}} and 'executive discretion' on the other...is at once arbitrary and hard to manage: if the statute itself is constitutional, all complaints must be about the exercise of 'executive discretion,' so there is no line to be drawn between Bowen and the case before us today." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Jim Doyle, {{the creator}} of Freddy's claw, asked Craven what he wanted, Craven responded, [...] "It's kind of like really long fingernails, I want the glove to look like {{something}} that someone could make who has the skills of a boilermaker." [...] Doyle explained, [...] "Then we hunted around for knives. We picked out this bizarre-looking steak knife, we thought that this looked really cool, {{we thought it would}} look even cooler if <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> it over and used it upside down. We had to remove the back edge and put another edge on it, because we were actually using the knife upside down." [...] Later Doyle had three duplicates of the glove made, two of which were used as stunt gloves in long shots.|$|E
2500|$|... "When I {{was twenty}} years old, {{we went to}} the Crows and stole a lot of horses. [...] The Crows {{discovered}} us and followed us all night. [...] When daylight came we saw them behind us. [...] I was the leader. [...] <b>We</b> <b>turned</b> back to fight the Crows. [...] I killed one and took his scalp and a field glass and a Crow necklace from him. [...] We chased the others back a long way and then caught up with our own men again and went on. [...] It was a very cold winter. [...] There were twenty of us and each had four horses. [...] We got them home all right and it was a good trip that time. [...] We had a scalp dance when we got back." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 9 March 2007, former Collingwood and Fitzroy defender Gary Pert was {{appointed}} the Magpies' CEO, seven weeks after Greg Swann departed for Carlton. In accepting the key Magpie post, Pert quit as a club director and as {{managing director of}} Channel 9 in Melbourne. In a press conference, it was stated that Collingwood has budgeted to turn over about $50million this year. McGuire hopes the new administration will soon double that figure. [...] "A finance administration review {{has come up with}} how we are going to turn Collingwood in to its next phase of its life", McGuire said. [...] "What do we do to make ourselves go from a $45million a year turnover business to a $100million turnover business? [...] "They sound like big figures but in 1999 <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> over $13million, so that is where we are heading as a football club." ...|$|E
2500|$|Maloney {{assembled}} {{the rest of}} his production team and engaged Roger Murray-Leach, with whom he had worked on the Doctor Who serials Planet of Evil, The Deadly Assassin and The Talons of Weng-Chiang, as production designer. To ensure uniformity of concept, Maloney asked Murray-Leach to design both the interior and exterior of the Liberator spacecraft. Murray-Leach [...] "...turned the ship around, so it was drawn to look as if it were going one way but flew the other way. In fact, if you take the line of flow, the angles go with it {{to get a sense of}} speed, and <b>we</b> <b>turned</b> that around so the 'wings' all canted forwards, not backwards". Murray-Leach's role as designer of the ship proved to be contentious with the series' special effects designer, Ian Scoones. Scoones found Murray-Leach's design for the Liberator awkward to mount and film for the scenes of the ship in flight.|$|E

[...] "Lima was killed {{because he did not}} uphold or couldn’t uphold, the commitments he had made in Palermo (…) The verdict of the Supreme Court was disaster. After the Supreme Court verdict we felt we were lost. That verdict was like a dose of poison for the mafiosi, who felt like wounded animals. That’s why they carried out the massacres. Something had to happen. I was surprised when people who had eight years of a prison sentence still to serve started giving themselves up. Then they killed Lima and I understood." [...] According to Mutolo, [...] "Lima was killed because he was the greatest symbol of that part of the political world which, after doing favours for Cosa Nostra in exchange for its votes, was no longer able to protect the interests of the organisation {{at the time of its}} most important trial." ...|$|E
