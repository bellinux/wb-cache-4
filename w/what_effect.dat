5|$|The viper dogfish has no {{economic}} value. It is very infrequently caught in commercial purse seines and bottom trawls targeting other species, though <b>what</b> <b>effect,</b> if any, fishing has on its population is unknown. As a result, the IUCN has listed it under Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|The adult jaguar is an apex predator, {{meaning it}} exists {{at the top}} of its food chain and is not preyed on in the wild. The jaguar has also been termed a {{keystone}} species, as it is assumed, through controlling the population levels of prey such as herbivorous and granivorous mammals, apex felids maintain the structural integrity of forest systems. However, accurately determining <b>what</b> <b>effect</b> species like the jaguar have on ecosystems is difficult, because data must be compared from regions where the species is absent as well as its current habitats, while controlling for the effects of human activity. It is accepted that mid-sized prey species undergo population increases {{in the absence of the}} keystone predators, and this has been hypothesized to have cascading negative effects. However, field work has shown this may be natural variability and the population increases may not be sustained. Thus, the keystone predator hypothesis is not accepted by all scientists.|$|E

25|$|McGovern {{had failed}} to act quickly when he learned of the mental health {{problems}} (though not their severe extent) because his own daughter was seriously depressed and he wondered <b>what</b> <b>effect</b> dumping Eagleton because of his depression would have on her. Ultimately, Eagleton threatened that if McGovern tried to force him off the ticket, he would fight the move. Eagleton conditioned his resignation on McGovern's releasing a statement, written by Eagleton, that Eagleton's health was fine and that McGovern had no issues with Eagleton's mental status.|$|E
25|$|Studies of the {{benefits}} of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D are conflicting, possibly because most studies did not have people with low dietary intakes. A 2013 review by the USPSTF found insufficient evidence to determine if supplementation with calcium and vitamin D results in greater harm or benefit in men and premenopausal women. The USPSTF did not recommend low dose supplementation (less than 1g of calcium and 400IU of vitamin D) in postmenopausal women as there {{does not appear to be}} a difference in fracture risk. It is unknown <b>what</b> <b>effect</b> higher doses have. A 2015 review found little data that supplementation of calcium decreases the risk of fractures.|$|E

25|$|In 1992, {{the minimum}} wage in New Jersey {{increased}} from $4.25 to $5.05 per hour (an 18.8% increase), while in the adjacent state of Pennsylvania it remained at $4.25. David Card and Alan Krueger gathered information on fast food restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania {{in an attempt to}} see <b>what</b> <b>effect</b> this increase had on employment within New Jersey. A basic supply and demand model predicts that relative employment should have decreased in New Jersey. Card and Krueger surveyed employers before the April 1992 New Jersey increase, and again in November–December 1992, asking managers for data on the full-time equivalent staff level of their restaurants both times. Based on data from the employers' responses, the authors concluded that the increase in {{the minimum wage}} slightly increased employment in the New Jersey restaurants.|$|E
25|$|When the United States {{entered the}} war, {{it was already}} mobilizing {{resources}} from academic, industry and military sectors {{for research and development}} into poison gas. A Subcommittee on Noxious Gases was created by the National Research Committee, a major research center was established at Camp American University, and the 1st Gas Regiment was recruited. The 1st Gas Regiment eventually served in France, where it used phosgene gas in a number of attacks. The Artillery used Mustard gas with significant effect during the Meuse Argonne Offensive on at least three occasions. The United States began large-scale production of an improved vesicant gas known as Lewisite, for use in an offensive planned for early 1919. By the time of the armistice on 11 November, a plant near Willoughby, Ohio was producing 10 tons per day of the substance, for a total of about 150 tons. It is uncertain <b>what</b> <b>effect</b> this new chemical would have had on the battlefield, however, as it degrades in moist conditions.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} studies of the economic impact of immigration to Canada is Morton Beiser's Strangers at the Gate. This study looked at the arrival of the Vietnamese boat people who began to arrive in Canada in 1979 to much controversy. The total number of refugees was 60,000, the largest single group of refugees to ever arrive in Canada. Beiser first studied the boat people upon their arrival, finding that few spoke English or French, that most were farmers with few skills useful in Canada, and that they had arrived with no assets with which to establish themselves. Beiser then followed the progress of the boat people to see <b>what</b> <b>effect</b> they would have on Canada. Within ten years of arrival the boat people had an unemployment rate 2.3% lower than the Canadian average. One in five had started a business, 99% had successfully applied to become Canadian citizens, and they were considerably less likely than average to receive some form of social assistance.|$|E
40|$|Using the {{principles}} of systems analysis as a guide, this study compared two class schedule formats used by Behavior Management and Parenting Services (BMAPS) {{in order to address}} the following research questions: 1) <b>What</b> <b>effects</b> do 2 different class formats have on student attrition and appointment keeping? 2) <b>What</b> <b>effects</b> do 2 different class formats have on student outcomes on a pre and posttest assessment? 3) <b>What</b> <b>effects</b> do 2 different class formats have on staff procedures? BMAPS provides parent education to individuals referred by Child Protective Services. The current research included approximately 200 referred clients with an appointment or class scheduled with BMAPS between January 1, 2006 and September 22, 2007. Data was collected by reviewing client files for class attendance and performance records. Results of this study allow BMAPS to enlist the class format that is correlated with better attrition rates and client outcomes...|$|R
