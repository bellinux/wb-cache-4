5|$|On November 22, 1977, Shakur {{pleaded not}} guilty to an {{attempted}} armed robbery indictment stemming from the 1971 incident at the Statler Hilton Hotel. Shakur was accused of attempting to rob a Michigan man staying at the hotel of $250 of cash and personal property. The prosecutor was C. Richard Gibbons. The charges were dismissed <b>without</b> <b>trial.</b>|$|E
5|$|Opposition {{political}} parties in Singapore have called for the ISA to be abolished. In its manifesto for the 2011 general election, the Workers' Party said that specific anti-terrorism and anti-espionage laws, which allow arrests and detention <b>without</b> <b>trial</b> only under strict conditions, should be enacted to replace the ISA. The National Solidarity Party took a similar stance in February 2013.|$|E

5|$|Samora Machel became Mozambique's first president. The Reverend Uria Simango, his wife, {{and other}} FRELIMO dissidents {{were arrested in}} 1975 and {{detained}} <b>without</b> <b>trial.</b> Within about two years, fighting resumed with the Mozambican Civil War against RENAMO insurgents plied with Rhodesian and South African military support. Industrial and social recession, Marxist-style totalitarianism, corruption, poverty, inequality and failed central planning eroded the initial revolutionary fervour. Peace returned only in 1992, when the nation achieved relative stability {{for the first time}} in several decades.|$|E
5|$|After {{being held}} {{eighteen}} months <b>without</b> <b>trial,</b> Amir is released {{and returned to}} Batavia. He is unable to find Tati, leaving him to wander the streets. Omi spots him, and again she asks him to play with her troupe. Amir agrees, and soon newspapers are filled with advertisements touting his name. Spotting one, Tati and Abdul Sidik go to a performance, only to learn that Amir {{was the victim of}} a car accident.

50|$|Alarmed by the developments, {{the radical}} {{elements}} in Warsaw reached for power. As the Jacobins demanded forceful {{action from the}} Supreme Council, the mob broke into the prisons; suspected traitors were hanged <b>without</b> <b>trials</b> and the King was threatened. Kościuszko's reaction was negative; {{the leaders of the}} riot were dealt with severely and the attempt by the left ended up with an inconclusive outcome.|$|R
50|$|There were {{repeated}} {{calls for the}} rule to be repealed, even midseason, {{and there has been}} much criticism of the AFL for introducing the rule into the regular season <b>without</b> <b>trialling</b> it first in the NAB Cup. The AFL has stated that the rule would remain beyond 2007, and fans' angst decreased as the season progressed, and as players became used to working within the interpretation.|$|R
50|$|While other dictatorships {{killed more}} people, Brazil's {{specialty}} was torture which they learned from Americans, but later learned interrogation techniques from the British. To extinguish its left-wing opponents, the dictatorship used arbitrary arrests, imprisonment <b>without</b> <b>trials,</b> kidnapping, {{and most of}} all, torture, which included rape and castration. The book Torture in Brazil provides accounts of {{only a fraction of}} the atrocities committed by the government.|$|R
5|$|Between 1973 and 1977, in New York and New Jersey, Shakur {{was indicted}} ten times, {{resulting}} in seven different criminal trials. Shakur {{was charged with}} two bank robberies, the kidnapping of a Brooklyn heroin dealer, the attempted murder of two Queens police officers stemming from a January 23, 1973 failed ambush, and eight other felonies related to the Turnpike shootout. Of these trials, three resulted in acquittals, one in a hung jury, one in a change of venue, one in a mistrial due to pregnancy, and one in a conviction; three indictments were dismissed <b>without</b> <b>trial.</b>|$|E
5|$|Born in Derby, England, Hickling served from 1941 until 1946 in the British Royal Navy during World War II, {{and then}} joined the Colonial Legal Service. In 1955, Hickling was posted to Malaya (now Malaysia), where he gained {{prominence}} as a lawmaker. He drafted the Constitution of Malaysia, and as Commissioner of Law Revision wrote the Internal Security Act (ISA) of 1960, which {{provided for the}} detention of persons <b>without</b> <b>trial.</b> The ISA was later used to oppress political opponents or those dedicated to non-violent activities, which Hickling later said was not his intention.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker was {{appointed}} to the House Committee on the Defence of Canada Regulations, an all-party committee which examined the wartime rules which allowed arrest and detention <b>without</b> <b>trial.</b> On June 13, 1940, Diefenbaker made his maiden speech as an MP, supporting the regulations, and emphatically stating that most Canadians of German descent were loyal. When the Mackenzie King government sought to force Canadians of Japanese descent from the Pacific Coast, Diefenbaker fought against the government's actions. However, his efforts were unsuccessful, and the forced relocation and internment of many Japanese-Canadians proceeded.|$|E

5|$|For {{his next}} major action, Gandhi {{decided on a}} raid of the Dharasana Salt Works in Gujarat, 25 miles south of Dandi. He wrote to Lord Irwin, again telling him of his plans. Around midnight of 4 May, as Gandhi was {{sleeping}} on a cot in a mango grove, the District Magistrate of Surat drove up with two Indian officers and thirty heavily armed constables. He was arrested under an 1827 regulation calling for the jailing of people engaged in unlawful activities, and held <b>without</b> <b>trial</b> near Poona (now Pune).|$|E
5|$|In the case, the Court {{examined}} {{whether it}} could review the executive's discretionary power under sections 8 and 10 of the Internal Security Act ("ISA"). Section 8 empowers the Minister for Home Affairs {{to make an}} order directing that a person be detained <b>without</b> <b>trial</b> if the President is satisfied that detention is necessary to prevent the person from endangering, among other things, the security or public order of Singapore, while section 10 allows the Minister to suspend detention orders and to revoke suspensions {{as he or she}} thinks fit.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{judicial}} system and legal codes of the Weimar Republic remained in use {{during and after the}} Nazi era to deal with non-political crimes. The courts issued and carried out far more death sentences than before the Nazis took power. People who were convicted of three or more offences—even petty ones—could be deemed habitual offenders and jailed indefinitely. People such as prostitutes and pickpockets were judged to be inherently criminal and a threat to the racial community. Thousands were arrested and confined indefinitely <b>without</b> <b>trial.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Ulsan Bodo League {{massacre}} {{was committed}} by the South Korean police against suspicious left-leaning civilians, most of them illiterate and uneducated peasants, who were misinformed when they registered themselves as Bodo League members. In the southeastern city of Ulsan, hundreds of people were massacred by South Korean police during {{the early months of}} the Korean War. In July and August 1950 alone, 407 civilians were summarily executed <b>without</b> <b>trials.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{procedure}} for the deportations {{was approved by}} Ivan Serov in the so-called Serov Instructions. People were deported <b>without</b> <b>trials</b> in whole families. Men were generally imprisoned {{and most of them}} died in Siberian prison camps (see Gulag); women and children were resettled in forced settlements in Omsk and Novosibirsk Oblasts, Krasnoyarsk and Altai Krais, and Kazakhstan. The mortality rate among the Estonian deportees was estimated at 60%.|$|R

5|$|On 12 July 1936, in Madrid, {{a member}} of the Falange named Jorge Bardina murdered Lieutenant José Castillo of the Assault Guards police force. Castillo was {{a member of}} the Socialist party. The next day, members of the Assault Guards arrested José Calvo Sotelo, a leading Spanish monarchist and a {{prominent}} parliamentary conservative; the original target was Gil Robles but he could not be found. Calvo Sotelo had protested against agricultural reforms, expropriations, and restrictions on the authority of the Catholic Church, which he considered Bolshevist and anarchist. He instead advocated the creation of a corporative state. Calvo Sotelo was shot by the Guards <b>without</b> <b>trial.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Nazis took {{advantage}} of the fire to advance their own political aims. The Reichstag Fire Decree, passed the next day on Hitler's urging, suspended basic rights and allowed detention <b>without</b> <b>trial.</b> Activities of the German Communist Party were suppressed, and some 4,000 communist party members were arrested. Göring demanded that the detainees should be shot, but Rudolf Diels, head of the Prussian political police, ignored the order. Some researchers, including William L. Shirer and Alan Bullock, are of the opinion that the NSDAP itself was responsible for starting the fire.|$|E

The murder of Kenneth Bigley led the BBC to cease publicising the final episode {{prior to its}} airing. It was broadcast again over three days in January 2005, with the third part updated to note the Law Lords ruling from the previous December that detaining foreign terrorist suspects <b>without</b> <b>trial</b> was illegal.|$|E

5|$|As chancellor, Hitler {{worked against}} {{attempts}} by the NSDAP's opponents to build a majority government. Because of the political stalemate, he asked Hindenburg to again dissolve the Reichstag, and elections were scheduled for early March. On 27 February 1933, the Reichstag building was set on fire. Göring blamed a communist plot, because Dutch communist Marinus van der Lubbe was found in incriminating circumstances inside the burning building. According to Kershaw, the consensus of nearly all historians is that van der Lubbe actually set the fire. Others, including William L. Shirer and Alan Bullock, are {{of the opinion that}} the NSDAP itself was responsible. At Hitler's urging, Hindenburg responded with the Reichstag Fire Decree of 28 February, which suspended basic rights and allowed detention <b>without</b> <b>trial.</b> The decree was permitted under Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution, which gave the president the power to take emergency measures to protect public safety and order. Activities of the German Communist Party (KPD) were suppressed, and some 4,000 KPD members were arrested.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in April 1934, and at Hitler's request, Heydrich and Himmler began {{building}} a dossier on Sturmabteilung (SA) leader Ernst Röhm {{in an effort}} to remove him as a rival for party leadership. At this point, the SS was still part of the SA, the early Nazi paramilitary organisation which now numbered over 3 million men. At Hitler's direction, Heydrich, Himmler, Göring, and Viktor Lutze drew up lists of those who should be liquidated, starting with seven top SA officials and including many more. On 30 June 1934 the SS and Gestapo acted in coordinated mass arrests that continued for two days. Röhm was shot <b>without</b> <b>trial,</b> along with the leadership of the SA. The purge became known as the Night of the Long Knives. Up to 200 people were killed in the action. Lutze was appointed SA's new head and it was converted into a sports and training organisation.|$|E
5|$|For {{refusing to}} {{contribute}} to the forced loan, over 70 gentlemen were arbitrarily jailed, <b>without</b> <b>trial</b> or charges brought against them. Five of them, Sir Thomas Darnell, Sir John Corbet, Sir Walter Erle, Sir John Heveningham and Sir Edmund Hampden, attempted to gain their freedom, petitioning the Court of King's Bench for a writ of habeas corpus. These were awarded on 3 November 1627, with the court ordering the bailiffs to present these prisoners to the King's Bench for examination by 8 November. None of the prisoners were presented, because the bailiffs were unable to determine what they were charged with; in an attempt to get a test case to decide on the legality of the forced loans, the Attorney General Sir Robert Heath secured a writ for Darnell. This led to the Five Knights' Case, known as Darnell's Case. Darnell, unnerved by the situation, ceased pursuing his freedom, and the other four secured writs instead, represented by John Bramston, Henry Calthorp and John Selden.|$|E
