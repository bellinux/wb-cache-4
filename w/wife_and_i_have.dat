[...] On 9 October 2010, {{which would have been}} Lennon's 70th birthday, the Liverpool Singing Choir performed [...] "Imagine" [...] along with other Lennon songs at the unveiling of the John Lennon Peace Monument in Chavasse Park, Liverpool, England. Beatles producer George Martin praised Lennon's solo work, singling out the composition: [...] "My favourite song of all was 'Imagine'". Music critic Paul Du Noyer described [...] "Imagine" [...] as Lennon's [...] "most revered" [...] post-Beatles song. Urish and Bielen called it [...] "the most subversive pop song recorded to achieve classic status". Fricke commented: [...] "'Imagine' is a subtly contentious song, Lennon's greatest combined achievement as a balladeer and agitator." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{contrast}} to his largely comedy-based acting career, Koechner starred in the 2016 drama Priceless, a film about human trafficking. He said of the role, [...] "My <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> five kids — {{three of them are}} daughters. So, just to imagine the horror of any young lady having to go through this. This film is based on true events. It’s happening right now. It’s happening in Chicago. It’s happening here in Los Angeles. It’s happening globally. So, to be a participant in a film like this — to bring awareness to such a horror — makes me happy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{people who}} worked with Genie, {{including}} Curtiss and James Kent, harshly criticized Rymer's works. A late April 1993 New York Times review of Rymer's book from scientific reporter Natalie Angier, which took an extremely negative view of the research team, prompted David Rigler to write his first public account of his involvement in Genie's case. In his letter to the Times, published in mid-June 1993, Rigler wrote that Genie was doing well in a small, private facility where her mother regularly visited her. He also stated that he and Marilyn were in contact with Genie's mother and had recently reestablished contact with Genie, writing that Genie was happy and that on their first visit she immediately greeted him and Marilyn by name, and said that, [...] "my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> resumed our (now infrequent) visits with Genie and her mother." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{film was}} shot in Old Saybrook, Connecticut in August of 1970. The village of Chester was used, as was the Chester-Hadlyme Ferry {{crossing}} the Connecticut River. Producer Badalato had suggested the location: [...] "My <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a weekend house in Chester, Connecticut. We loved the area and shared our feelings with John Hancock and the Mosses. After a preliminary scout {{we all agree that}} this was where Jessica should be filmed." ...|$|R
2500|$|By 1977, both Molland and Evans {{were out}} of the music business. Molland later {{described}} his dire economic circumstances: [...] "Thank God I had guitars and I was able to sell some of that stuff. We were flat broke, and that's happened to me three times, where my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had to sell off everything and go and stay with her parents or do whatever. I installed carpeting for a while in Los Angeles and stuff like that. You do what you've got to do to survive." [...] In London, Evans briefly had jobs insulating pipes, and driving a taxi. Collins was having trouble paying the lease on the group's two-room rehearsal studio at No. 6 Denmark Street, London. After advertising for new occupants, he was contacted by Malcolm McLaren, manager of the Sex Pistols, who gave Collins £650 (...) and a Fender Rhodes piano as down payment.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} {{shall not}} tell you a lie. Mr. Dalrymple has asked me to be his <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> made him no answer. If he asks me again I shall accept him." ...|$|E

50|$|After {{years of}} gestation, {{the idea for}} the Toonerville Trolley was born one day up in Westchester County when my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> left New York City to visit Charlie Voight, the cartoonist, in the Pelhams. At the station, we saw a rattletrap of a streetcar, which had as its crew and skipper a wistful old codger with an Airedale beard. He showed as much concern in the {{performance}} of his job as you might expect from Captain Hartley when docking the Leviathan.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{think they}} wanted more time, {{but it was}} {{impossible}} with my family commitments and my other activities," [...] Foster said. [...] "And I told them I wasn't able to move to Orange County. With my work in Europe, that would have been impossible. But my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> gotten so excited about the possibility that we were considering moving back to the United States in a couple of years, to New York, so we could be midway between Southern California and Europe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you {{interfere}} between us," [...] the man said, [...] "it will go hardly with you. This lady is my <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a {{right to}} be here. I have the right also to throw you out." ...|$|E
60|$|DEAR MRS. McQUISTON,--I {{have never}} had an {{experience}} which moved me to believe the living can communicate with the dead, but my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> experimented in the matter when opportunity offered and shall continue to do so.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know nothing}} of his displeasure, and care less. He has agreed that Isabel shall be your <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> passed my word to the engagement; and if, sir, you wish to be {{considered}} as my son, you will prepare to comply." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No;--it is not morning. You shall sleep again presently. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{thought of}} it, and you shall be Brooke's <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will <b>have</b> it here, {{and we will}} all be friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|Again, when I {{heard of}} the arrest of my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> {{children}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> cried out in rage: [...] "God sleeps! God sleeps! There cannot be a God!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense! Who {{talks of}} starving, when {{provision}} is as plenty as blackberries? I tell you I understand this matter, {{and know how}} little a man can get along with. I've tried it myself. When I first set out in life, my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not a pair of andirons or a shovel and tongs {{for two or three}} years, and we never thought of complaining. The times are hard. We are all losing, and must get along as we can; and Mr. Stanton must bear some rubs as well as the rest of us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My misery {{has brought}} me here,' replied the old man; 'I have no child, {{and all our}} lives my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> longed for one. So I left my home, and {{went out into the}} world, hoping that somewhere I might find what I was seeking.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know that,' {{said the}} man; 'your real father was sold at Hamburg last Michaelmas, and your real mother died while calving in spring; but my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> adopted you as our own, {{and you are}} our only heir, so you must call me [...] "Father."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe," [...] Mr. Sabin said, [...] "that I {{have that}} privilege. I see, however, that I am {{interrupting}} your game. Let me beg you to continue. With your permission, Duchess, I {{will remain a}} spectator. There are many things which my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> to say to one another." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{drove around}} the harbor that {{day with a}} lighter heart than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> hoped ever to possess again. When I reached Spruce Cove the first person I met was old Abel Blair. I asked him if any child were missing from the Cove or along shore. He looked at me in surprise, shook his head, {{and said he had}} not heard of any. I told him as much of the tale as was necessary, leaving him to think that my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> found the dory and its small {{passenger}} during an ordinary walk along the shore.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank God," [...] exclaimed Mr. Brinsmade, fervently. [...] "If {{you will}} excuse me, madam, I shall hurry {{to tell my}} <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> daughter. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{been able to find}} no one who saw him." ...|$|R
60|$|Whilst he was {{speaking}} the cat was continuing her frantic efforts to get up the wall. She would take a run back and then charge up, sometimes reaching an incredible height. She {{did not seem to}} mind the heavy fall which she get each time but started with renewed vigour; and at every tumble her appearance became more horrible. Hutcheson was a kind-hearted man--my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> both noticed little acts of kindness to animals as well as to persons--and he seemed concerned at the state of fury to which the cat had wrought herself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Therefore," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Easterfield, [...] "I {{will simply}} state that my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{very good reason}} to believe that your niece is about to engage herself in marriage; and I will only add that we are very sorry, indeed, that this should have occurred under our roof." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Linda Tressel is my true and lawful <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> come to {{take her}} away with me. She went with me once, and now she will go again. Where is she? You're not going to keep her locked up. It's {{against the law to}} make a young woman a prisoner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is a matter," [...] said I, [...] "which I {{can easily}} prove {{to you by}} actual demonstration. If you can wait a short time, until my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> had {{something}} to eat--for I am nearly famished, and I am sure she must be--I will set your mind at rest upon that point." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would you, Kreta?" [...] Ronald asked, eagerly. [...] "But no, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{no right}} to take you into such danger as that. You <b>have</b> a <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> child; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no one to depend upon me." ...|$|R
60|$|ATTEN. Well, {{but before}} we leave Mr. Badman's <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> children, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a mind, if you please, to inquire a little more after one thing, the which I am sure you can satisfy me in.|$|R
40|$|I {{confess that}} I {{did not intend}} to take an {{inventory}} of the modest wealth my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> accumulated in nine years of married life. But a pair of birds got stuck in the attic, tried to find their way out the rear window, and made a mess of things. It was not as psycho as a Hitchcock movie, but it forced my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> me to look hard at our belongings. We found our daughter Rebecca’s baby clothes, several pieces of luggage, and many used electronic gadgets, specifically, two stereos, several old PCs, a very old TV, a college dorm refrigerator, our first video camera, several phones...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{brought you}} {{more money to}} invest, Mr Wilkins," [...] said John Jack, sitting down after wiping his forehead, and {{producing}} a fat pocketbook; [...] "I thought of doin' it in the old way, but my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been thinkin' that perhaps it might be wise {{to put some of}} the eggs in another basket." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Courtledge," [...] he said, [...] "I {{think that}} you will allow me to ask you {{something}} without thinking me impertinent. You know that my <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> taken some interest in Prince Albert. It is on his account, is it not, that you look so gloomy to-night, as though you had an execution in front of you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{been talking}} the matter over, Mr. Brook," [...] the {{schoolmaster}} said, [...] "and we deplore these feasts, {{which are the}} bane of the place. They demoralize the village; all sorts of good resolutions give way under temptation, and then those who have given way are ashamed to rejoin their better companions. It cannot be put down, I suppose?" ...|$|E
5000|$|On the October 4, 2008 {{episode of}} Saturday Night Live the show lampooned the Wachovia {{takeover}} of Golden West Financial {{as part of}} a segment on the financial bailout. Darrell Hammond, as Herb Sandler, states that [...] "My <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a company which aggressively marketed subprime mortgages, and then bundled them as securities to sell to banks such as Wachovia. Today, our portfolio's worth almost nothing, though, at one point, it was worth close to $19 billion." [...] In response to the show, the real Herb Sandler said that he's been [...] "listening to this crap for two years" [...] and [...] "we are being unfairly tarred." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But this is senseless, milor," [...] {{she said}} impatiently. [...] "You seem {{to forget that}} <b>I</b> am your <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a right to your protection, and to a fitting home if I am to leave Versailles." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{seen so many}} of {{such things}} that I {{was not so much}} shocked as you might suppose. After all a fine hare like myself could always get another <b>wife,</b> <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> <b>have</b> told you she was very self-willed.|$|R
