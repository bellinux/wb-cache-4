It would have been impossible to have done otherwise....As to the 'extra' indemnities, we had to provide them for the widows and orphans left penniless and homeless, and who had lost no property to be paid for because they had none. We collected an extra one-third with the consent of the authorities, and distributed it among these people....It was considered perfectly just and fair by everyone there. Then, too, we had to provide for these people, and so we went to the abandoned grain shops and took <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> find. If we had not done so the Chinese would have. We promised to pay for everything we took. We also sold off all the furniture and goods in the place and used the money to support our Christians. I have been surprised to hear that this was criticised.|$|E
500|$|In July 2010, Feargus Urquhart, {{replying}} to {{an interview}} question about what franchises {{he would like to}} work on, said that [...] "if [...] could come across everything that [...] played", he would choose a Chrono Trigger game. At the time, Urquhart's company Obsidian Entertainment was making Dungeon Siege III for Square Enix. Urquhart said: [...] "You make RPGs, we make RPGs, {{it would be great to}} see <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do together. And they really wanted to start getting into Western RPGs. And, so it kind of all ended up fitting together." [...] Yoshinori Kitase revealed in 2011 that he used the time travel mechanics of Chrono Trigger as a starting point for that of Final Fantasy XIII-2.|$|E

After his work for Flapjack, McHale moved on to co-develop Adventure Time, where he served as creative director, and subsequently as a writer. The network later {{asked him if he}} had interest in developing a pilot, which led to him returning to Tome of the Unknown, polishing it and pitching it again to the network. After creating a pilot episode, , McHale and the network settled upon the miniseries format for the ensuing series, as McHale felt that it would lead to [...] "something that felt higher quality than <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do with a regular series". McHale abandoned the original idea centered around chapters of a mystical tome and the series' title became Over the Garden Wall.|$|E

500|$|... …And Justice for All is a musically {{progressive}} album featuring {{long and}} complex songs, fast tempos and few verse-chorus structures. Metallica decided to broaden its sonic range, writing songs with multiple sections, heavy guitar arpeggios and unusual time signatures. Hetfield later explained: [...] "Songwriting-wise, [...] was just us really showing off {{and trying to}} show <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do. 'We've jammed six riffs into one song? Let's make it eight. Let's go crazy with it.'" [...] Music critic Simon Reynolds noted the riff changes and experimentation with timing on the album's epically constructed songs: [...] "The tempo shifts, gear changes, lapses, decelerations and abrupt halts". BBC Music's Eamonn Stack wrote that …And Justice for All sounds different from the band's previous albums, with longer songs, sparser arrangements, and harsher vocals by Hetfield. According to journalist Martin Popoff, the album was less melodic than its predecessors because of its frequent tempo changes, unusual song structures and layered guitars. He argued that the album {{is more of a}} progressive metal record because of its intricately performed music and bleak sound. Music writer Joel McIver called the album's music aggressive enough for Metallica to maintain its place with bands [...] "at the mellower end of extreme metal". According to writer Christopher Knowles, Metallica took [...] "the thrash concept to its logical conclusion" [...] on the album.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of {{repeated}} racial bigotry, Russell refused to respond to fan acclaim or friendship from his neighbors, thinking it was insincere and hypocritical. This attitude contributed to his legendarily bad rapport with fans and journalists. He alienated Celtics fans by saying, [...] "You owe the public the same it owes you, nothing! I refuse to smile and be nice to the kiddies." [...] This supported the opinion of many white fans that Russell (who was by then the highest-paid Celtic) was egotistical, paranoid and hypocritical. The already hostile atmosphere between Russell and Boston hit its apex when vandals broke into his house, covered the walls with racist graffiti, damaged his trophies and defecated in the beds. In response, Russell described Boston as a [...] "flea market of racism". In King Of The Court by Aram Goudsouzian, he was quoted saying, [...] "From my very first year I {{thought of myself as}} playing for the Celtics, not for Boston. The fans could do or think whatever they wanted." [...] Referring to a time when the Celtics could not sell out the Boston Garden despite hockey’s popularity in the same stadium, Russell recalled “We [...] did a survey about <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do to improve attendance. Over 50 percent of responses said 'There’s too many black players.'” In retirement, Russell described the Boston press as corrupt and racist; in response, Boston sports journalist Larry Claflin claimed that Russell himself was the real racist.|$|E

Director Yoshirou Kimura started work on the project as he helped his colleagues at Love-de-Lic finish that company's final game, [...] Production of Chulip began in the earliest days of the PS2, making it a challenge for the development team who only had experience with the original PlayStation. Kimura valued his team members' opinions and ideas while working on it. [...] "It was challenging and interesting at the same time to program a game for a new console," [...] he stated. [...] "We were definitely eager to see <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do with it." [...] The original idea for Chulip came when Kimura visited Western countries and saw couples kissing in public, a custom not often performed among Japanese people. Kimura came up with game's title after attending a party in Tokyo. As the intoxicated partygoers talked about video games, they began to humorously say [...] "chu-shite" [...] (lit. [...] "kiss me"). The title Chulip is a play on words: a cross between chu (the Japanese onomatopoeia for the sound of a kiss) and the English word lip, as well as the Japanese rendering of the word tulip.|$|E

500|$|In late 1977, {{while in}} {{rehearsal}} {{for their next}} album, and {{just days before the}} band was set to enter the studio, Osbourne abruptly quit the band. Iommi called vocalist Dave Walker, a longtime friend of the band, who had previously been a member of Fleetwood Mac and Savoy Brown, and informed him that Osbourne had left the band. Walker, who was at that time fronting a band called Mistress, flew to Birmingham from California in late 1977 to write material and rehearse with Black Sabbath. On 8 January 1978, Black Sabbath made their only live performance with Walker on vocals, playing an early version of the song [...] "Junior's Eyes" [...] on the BBC Television programme [...] "Look! Hear!" [...] Walker later recalled that while in Birmingham he had bumped into Osbourne in a pub and {{came to the conclusion that}} Osbourne was not fully committed to leaving Black Sabbath. [...] "The last Sabbath albums were just very depressing for me", Osbourne said. [...] "I was doing it for the sake of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> get out of the record company, just to get fat on beer and put a record out." [...] Walker has said that he wrote a lot of lyrics during his brief time in the band but none of them were ever used. If any recordings of this version of the band other than the [...] "Look! Hear!" [...] footage still exist, Walker says that he is not aware of them.|$|E
500|$|According to Hubbard, the team's [...] "greatest asset was [...] {{the list}} of {{mistakes}} we made during Shogo. We started this project with a pretty sober view of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> achieve. As a result, every major feature we outlined {{made it into the}} game, as well as a few additional items we came up with during the project." [...] However, there were still things that the team didn't have enough time to implement. For example, No One Lives Forevers team-based multiplayer portion was originally going to be a story-driven cooperative gameplay mode (similar to the [...] "Assault" [...] game type in the 1999 first-person shooter Unreal Tournament), including objectives and obstacles for the two teams. Like the single-player story in the game, this gameplay mode was also going to incorporate humor; for example, in one map, a goal of each team was to find a special watermelon for a mayor in a Moroccan marketplace. While this mode was publicly discussed even in July 2000, it is not present as such in the final product (which went gold on October 20). The different objectives were changed to a general goal for both teams in all maps: photographing the other team's intelligence item. However, a number of remnants stemming from the earlier gameplay design can be seen in some of the released maps, such as the office of the aforementioned mayor seen in the Morocco map. Fully realized co-operative multiplayer was, however, a feature of No One Lives Forever 2.|$|E
