The brush size, {{which is}} a number between 0 (small space between teeth) and 8 (large space), indicates the passage hole diameter.

25|$|Constant-voltage speaker {{systems are}} {{analogous}} to electrical power transmission methods employed by power companies to transmit electrical power over long distances. Typically, a power company will {{step up the}} voltage of the power being transmitted, which correspondingly reduces the current and therefore also reduces the power loss during transmission. The voltage is stepped back down at the destination. Similarly, in a constant-voltage speaker system the amplifier uses a transformer to step up the voltage of the audio signal to reduce power loss over the speaker cable, allowing more power to be transmitted over a given <b>wire</b> <b>diameter.</b> Each speaker in the system has a step-down transformer to convert the voltage back to a usable level.|$|E

2500|$|Gas flow {{proportional}} counters {{are used}} mainly for detection of longer wavelengths. Gas flows through it continuously. Where {{there are multiple}} detectors, the gas is passed through them in series, then led to waste. The gas is usually 90% argon, 10% methane ("P10"), although the argon may be replaced with neon or helium where very long wavelengths (over 5nm) are to be detected. The argon is ionised by incoming X-ray photons, and the electric field multiplies this charge into a measurable pulse. The methane suppresses the formation of fluorescent photons caused by recombination of the argon ions with stray electrons. The anode wire is typically tungsten or nichrome of 20–60 μm diameter. Since the pulse strength obtained is essentially proportional to {{the ratio of the}} detector chamber diameter to the <b>wire</b> <b>diameter,</b> a fine wire is needed, but it must also be strong enough to be maintained under tension so that it remains precisely straight and concentric with the detector. The window needs to be conductive, thin enough to transmit the X-rays effectively, but thick and strong enough to minimize diffusion of the detector gas into the high vacuum of the monochromator chamber. Materials often used are beryllium metal, aluminised PET film and aluminised polypropylene. Ultra-thin windows (down to 1 μm) for use with low-penetration long wavelengths are very expensive. The pulses are sorted electronically by [...] "pulse height selection" [...] in order to isolate those pulses deriving from the secondary X-ray photons being counted.|$|E
