500|$|After {{the first}} five songs, The Revival {{features}} songs at a calmer tempo and more conventional style, with ballads that are more relaxed and low-key. [...] "It Never Rains (In Southern California)" [...] was titled after an oft-repeated phrase from one of Tony! Toni! Toné!'s attorneys, who used it {{in response to the}} group wearing heavy coats after returning from visits on the East Coast. Group drummer Timothy Christian played most of the song's instruments, and bassist Raphael Wiggins wrote its lyrics about a man longing for a woman who was in southern California. The ballads are followed by [...] "Those Were the Days", which features jouncing banjo, trumpet, and wistful lyrics reminiscing about simpler times [...] "when a dollar was worth a dollar, and you didn't have to carry a gun <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>left</b> your house." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{was natural}} {{you should expect}} me, mademoiselle. I was sorry {{afterwards}} that I did not tell <b>you</b> <b>when</b> I <b>left</b> <b>you</b> that I should {{not be able to}} come in the evening, but indeed I did not think of it at the time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{enjoyed the}} fun, too. It {{meant so much}} to me. I began to live, then, and found life very sweet. But <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{suddenly}} <b>left</b> me and went abroad--ah, that was indeed serious." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take {{care that}} you don't walk over a precipice some day <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>left</b> all the fences behind. But I've kept {{you from your}} meditations, and I had better see if Mrs. Nairn is coming." ...|$|R

5000|$|... cohort modelThis {{model was}} {{proposed}} by Marslen-Wilson and was {{designed specifically to}} account for auditory word recognition. It works by breaking the word down and states that when a word is heard all words that begin with the first sound of the target word are activated. This set of words is considered the cohort. Once the first cohort has been activated, the other information, or sounds in the word narrow down the choices. The person recognizes the word <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are <b>left</b> with a single choice; this is considered the [...] "recognition point".|$|R
