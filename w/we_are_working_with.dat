We're always looking to re-position to be reflective of today's audience." [...] Gail Simone, who will be writing the series, stated: [...] "For many years, I got to write the character as Oracle, and there is to this day, no character who means more to me. This is classic Barbara as she was originally conceived, with a few big surprises. It’s {{a bit of a}} shock, to be sure, but we’re {{doing everything we can to}} be respectful to this character’s amazing legacy, while presenting something thrilling that a generation of comics readers will be experiencing for the first time... Barbara Gordon leaping, fighting, and swinging over Gotham. Now, when citizens of that city look up, they are going to see BATGIRL. And that is absolutely thrilling." ...|$|E

"By {{determining}} {{that the need}} or desire for power was the motivating force behind battering, we created a conceptual framework that, in fact, did not fit the lived experience {{of many of the}} men and women <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>working</b> <b>with.</b> The DAIP staff ... remained undaunted by the difference in our theory and the actual experiences of those <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> ... It <b>was</b> the cases themselves that created the chink in each of our theoretical suits of armor. Speaking for myself, I found that many of the men I interviewed did not seem to articulate a desire for power over their partner. Although I relentlessly took every opportunity to point out to men in the groups that they were so motivated and merely in denial, the fact that few men ever articulated such a desire went unnoticed by me and many of my coworkers.

[...] "You've got to remember, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> humans here and we are prone to human error. We do the best we can, and we learn from our mistakes."

2500|$|In January 2015, a {{customer}} named Ricardo Brown received a bill from Comcast {{with his name}} changed to [...] "Asshole Brown". Brown's wife, Lisa, believed a Comcast employee changed the name {{in response to the}} Browns' request to cancel their cable service, an incident in which she was refused a cancellation unless she paid a $60 fee and instead was routed to a retention specialist. Comcast refused to correct the name on their bill after bringing it to the attention of numerous customer service outlets for the company by explaining that Ricardo is the legal name of the customer, so the Browns turned to consumer advocate Christopher Elliott. Elliott posted the facts of the incident, along with a copy of the bill, on his blog. Shortly thereafter, Elliott contacted Comcast and Comcast offered the Browns an apology, a $60 refund, and a promise to track down and fire the responsible employee. The Browns instead requested a full refund for their negative experience and Comcast agreed to refund the family {{the last two years of}} service and provide the next two years of service at no charge. Comcast released a statement explaining: [...] "We have spoken with our customer and apologized for this completely unacceptable and inappropriate name change. We have zero tolerance for this type of disrespectful behavior and are conducting a thorough investigation to determine what happened. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> our customer to make this right and will take appropriate steps to prevent this from happening again." ...|$|E

He was able to raise $13 million in pledges, lobbied the state legislature, and by the time then-FAU President, Anthony Catanese, asked him to find a coach in 1999, Schnellenberger selected himself.
