Twyford had showrooms for <b>water</b> <b>closets</b> in Berlin, Germany; Sydney, Australia; and Cape Town, South Africa. The Public Health Act 1875 set down stringent guidelines relating to sewers, drains, water supply and toilets and lent tacit government endorsement to the prominent water closet manufacturers of the day.|$|E
25|$|Court 15 {{may have}} {{originally}} had a {{water pump in}} the courtyard, though this is not known for certain. By the 1880s, a single tap had been installed. The brick paved yard contains an open drain running {{in front of the}} three back houses. In the 1930s, the two washhouses and <b>water</b> <b>closets</b> (outdoor flush toilets) were constructed {{on the site of the}} workshops and outbuildings in the courtyard.|$|E
25|$|Prolific {{inventor}} Joseph Bramah {{began his}} professional career installing <b>water</b> <b>closets</b> (toilets) that {{were based on}} Alexander Cumming's patented design of 1775. He found that the current model being installed in London houses {{had a tendency to}} freeze in cold weather. In collaboration with a Mr Allen, he improved the design by replacing the usual slide valve with a hinged flap that sealed the bottom of the bowl.|$|E
2500|$|By the 1880s, the {{free-standing}} <b>water</b> <b>closet</b> {{was sold}} and quickly gained popularity; the free-standing <b>water</b> <b>closet</b> {{was able to}} be cleaned more easily and was therefore a more hygienic <b>water</b> <b>closet.</b> Twyford's [...] "Unitas" [...] model was free standing and made completely of earthenware. Throughout the 1880s he submitted further patents for improvements to the flushing rim and the outlet. Finally in 1888, he applied for a patent protection for his [...] "after flush" [...] chamber; the device allowed for the basin to be refilled by a lower quantity of clean water in reserve after the <b>water</b> <b>closet</b> was flushed. The modern pedestal [...] "flush-down" [...] toilet was demonstrated by Frederick Humpherson of the Beaufort Works, Chelsea, England in 1885.|$|R

25|$|The station {{received}} a face-lift in the 1930s, {{at which time}} the restaurant was moved from the southern to the northern wing. It was moved back after renovations in 1954, which also saw the main entrance moved to the road side and the offices and ticket booths renovated. <b>Water</b> <b>closets</b> were installed. To shorten {{the distance to the}} ferry quay, a pedestrian path was built in the 1950s. Following the 1962 opening of the Brevik Bridge the railway saw a sharp decline in patronage as the bus service was rerouted, capturing more of the traffic. Thus NSB decided to terminate the commuter trains to Skien from 1 February 1964. The express trains followed suit and since 26 May 1968 there has only been freight trains on the line. Brevik Station remained in use until 1 February 1982.|$|E
25|$|Despite the opposition, Manchester's first proper {{council was}} elected in 1838, {{although}} its area of jurisdiction was quite small, and there were independent areas within the city, such as Chorlton-on-Medlock, which had their own committees to manage local functions. The new council began the task of constructing a brick-built sewerage network within the city. In 1847, John Francis the Borough Surveyor suggested using egg-shaped clay pipes instead, and using these proved to be much quicker. However, the period also saw {{the introduction of the}} water closet, the forerunner of the modern flush toilet, and this resulted in much larger volumes of effluent entering the system. The council tried to limit their use to public buildings and the homes of the rich, as the waste was discharged in an untreated state into the rivers, which were becoming grossly polluted. This policy was not successful, and by the early 1890s, around 90 per cent of the housing in Manchester had <b>water</b> <b>closets.</b>|$|E
500|$|Following {{the successes}} seen in various {{northern}} towns, about 7,000 pail closets {{were introduced in}} 1871 in Leicester, where the implementation of <b>water</b> <b>closets</b> had been hindered by the refusal of the water company to provide adequate supplies. [...] The use of pail closets reduced the demand placed upon the area's inadequate sewerage system, but the town suffered with difficulties in the collection and treatment of the night soil. [...] Initially, night soil was collected by contractors, but after 1873 the local authority became responsible. [...] The authority found dealing with the night soil an expensive and difficult business and, following legal proceedings against the corporation in 1878, transport of night soil was transferred from the railway system to canal barges. [...] This, however, led to complaints that the canal was being polluted. [...] In 1886, the authority found that the River Soar was badly polluted by sewage and so they built a sewage farm at Beaumont Leys. [...] By {{the end of the}} 19th century, this and {{the construction of a new}} sewer system enabled all pail closets to be phased out and replaced by <b>water</b> <b>closets.</b> [...] In Manchester, faced with phenomenal population growth, the council attempted to retain the pail closet system, but following the exposure of the dumping of [...] of human faeces into the Medlock and Irwell rivers at their Holt Town sewage works, the council was forced to change their plans. [...] Originally they had intended to build incinerators, but public objections to the dumping of waste into rivers forced the council instead to purchase Carrington Moss in 1886, and Chat Moss in 1895, which were both developed as refuse disposal sites. [...] But by the 1930s neither site was still receiving night soil, the water closet having replaced dry conservancy in Manchester.|$|E

50|$|From 1924 forward, Haas focused almost {{exclusively}} on improving the internal workings of the <b>water</b> <b>closet</b> for toilets in homes and light commercial settings. His first endeavors in this regard dealt with inlet valve mechanisms. However, his efforts soon led him to design and perfect an entire system, leading to at least six patents. The last of these, number 1,660,922, issued posthumously. Modern toilets incorporate many elements of Haasâ€™ <b>water</b> <b>closet</b> designs.|$|R

2500|$|The area of Strood around Knight's Place and Temple Street, was {{referred}} to as the Swamp. On the floods Smetham wrote in 1899 in that woebegone spot the foul contents of <b>water</b> <b>closets</b> were washed into poor peoples homes, and an indescribable filth permeated the fetid spot for months. [...] In 1912 there was a typhoid outbreak here, 56 people contracted it, and five died.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the growth}} of {{population}} {{in the late nineteenth}} century, and the proliferation of <b>water</b> <b>closets,</b> the rivers around Manchester were becoming grossly polluted, and the City of Manchester decided to build two deep level sewers to intercept existing sewers. When the first one reached Davyhulme, further extension was blocked by the Manchester Ship Canal, and so a treatment works was built there. The works used precipitation tanks, and a [...] gauge tramway was built, to facilitate the movement of materials around the site. The first steam locomotive was acquired in 1897, and a further fourteen steam and two diesel locomotives operated on the system before its closure in 1958.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{pioneering}} manufacturer was Thomas William Twyford, {{who invented}} the single piece, ceramic flush toilet. The 1870s {{proved to be a}} defining period for the sanitary industry and the water closet; the debate between the simple water closet trap basin made entirely of earthenware and the very elaborate, complicated and expensive mechanical water closet would fall under public scrutiny and expert opinion. In 1875, the [...] "wash-out" [...] trap water closet was first sold and was found as the public's preference for basin type <b>water</b> <b>closets.</b> By 1879, Twyford had devised his own type of the [...] "wash out" [...] trap water closet, he titled it the [...] "National", and became the most popular wash-out water closet.|$|E

2500|$|George Jennings {{established}} a business manufacturing <b>water</b> <b>closets,</b> salt-glaze drainage, sanitary pipes and sanitaryware at Parkstone Pottery in the 1840s, where he popularized the flush toilet to middle class. At The Great Exhibition at Hyde Park held from 1 May to 15 October 1851, George Jennings installed his Monkey Closets in the Retiring Rooms of The Crystal Palace. These {{were the first}} public pay toilets (free ones did not appear until later), and they caused great excitement. During the exhibition, 827,280 visitors paid one penny to use them; for the penny they got a clean seat, a towel, a comb, and a shoe shine. [...] "To spend a penny" [...] became a euphemism (now archaic) for going to the toilet.|$|E

2500|$|William Matthew Scott {{was born}} at 128 Camp Road (now Oatland Lane) in Little London, Leeds, Yorkshire on 30 September 1893. Camp Road was {{demolished}} in the 1960s. His place of birth was next to the poor Jewish immigrant area of tailors and shoemakers, called the Leylands, in the All Souls district of Leeds. At least until 1911 Scott lived in the working-class areas of Little London and Woodhouse, next to Meanwood Beck. The area {{has a history of}} poverty, and within living memory were the Woodhouse cholera epidemic of the 1840s, and the typhoid epidemic in nearby Headingley of 1889. When Scott was born, the middens and ashpits which had nurtured the diseases were being replaced by communal <b>water</b> <b>closets.</b> That meant that inhabitants of the back-to-backs had to walk {{to the end of the}} row to use the lavatory or empty a chamber pot but they would not catch cholera; communal outside lavatories and cobbled streets with washing lines overhead persisted while Scott lived there. However it should be remembered that street communities were strong, public transport was efficient and good quality education and libraries were available for working people. All the addresses at which Scott lived in his youth were demolished in the early 1960s slum clearances to make way for new council estates, but it should be remembered that many of these buildings were known to be repairable, so that [...] "slum" [...] was often a misnomer.|$|E
