500|$|In January 1977, {{four years}} prior to {{becoming}} president, Ronald Reagan bluntly stated, {{in a conversation with}} Richard V. Allen, his basic expectation in relation to the Cold War. [...] "My idea of American policy toward the Soviet Union is simple, and some would say simplistic," [...] he said. [...] "It is this: We win and they lose. <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that?" [...] In 1980, Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, vowing to increase military spending and confront the Soviets everywhere. Both Reagan and new British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher denounced the Soviet Union and its ideology. Reagan labeled the Soviet Union an [...] "evil empire" [...] and predicted that Communism would be left on the [...] "ash heap of history," [...] while Thatcher inculpated the Soviets as [...] "bent on world dominance." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} 1898 Dresser {{reported}} that nearly one million copies of sheet music would soon be sold, making [...] "Wabash" [...] a [...] "sensation", the [...] "great hit of the day." [...] In a newspaper interview Dresser said, [...] "I can’t tell you just how much I have cleared off of the song, but the $50,000 estimate I have seen in some papers is very modest. You see I am a publisher {{as well as a}} composer and have a big printing house of my own in New York. I also write the words for all my songs, dictate the circumstances and stage settings for their public introductions, write my own ads, and sometimes sing my own songs. Now <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that for a monopoly. Eh?" [...] Dresser earned a substantial income from the song, including royalties through the sale of sheet music.|$|E

500|$|Among {{the most}} popular of Henson's {{commercials}} was a series for the local Wilkins Coffee company in Washington, D.C., in which his Muppets were able to get away with a greater level of slapstick violence than might have been acceptable with human actors and would later find its way into many acts on The Muppet Show. In the first Wilkins ad, a Muppet named Wilkins is poised behind a cannon seen in profile. Another Muppet named Wontkins is in front of its barrel. Wilkins asks, [...] "What do you think of Wilkins Coffee?" [...] and Wontkins responds gruffly, [...] "Never tasted it!" [...] Wilkins fires the cannon and blows Wontkins away, then turns the cannon directly toward the viewer and ends the ad with, [...] "Now, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Wilkins?" [...] Henson later explained, [...] "Till then, advertising agencies believed that the hard sell {{was the only way to}} get their message over on television. We took a very different approach. We tried to sell things by making people laugh." [...] The first seven-second commercial for Wilkins was an immediate hit and was syndicated and re-shot by Henson for local coffee companies across the United States; he ultimately produced more than 300 coffee ads. The same setup was used to pitch Kraml Milk in the Chicago area, Red Diamond coffee, several bread products, and even Faygo.|$|E

2500|$|The Reagan Doctrine was {{especially}} significant because it represented a substantial {{shift in the}} post–World War II foreign policy of the United States. Prior to the Reagan Doctrine, U.S. {{foreign policy in the}} Cold War was rooted in [...] "containment", as originally defined by George F. Kennan, John Foster Dulles, and other post–World War II U.S. foreign policy experts. In January 1977, four years prior to becoming president, Reagan bluntly stated, in a conversation with Richard V. Allen, his basic expectation in relation to the Cold War. [...] "My idea of American policy toward the Soviet Union is simple, and some would say simplistic," [...] he said.

2500|$|The {{somewhat}} convoluted plot of Simon Boccanegra {{is hard to}} follow. Budden notes: [...] "All {{the characters}} define themselves against an ingeniously shifting pattern of intrigue such as can be highly effective in a play but well-nigh impossible to follow in an opera". [...] Verdi had {{gone so far as}} to actually write out the scenario in prose, which he then submitted to Piave in August; all that he expected from his librettist was that it would be turned into poetry, so Verdi balked somewhat when the censors demanded a complete poetic version: [...] "what does it matter for the moment it's in prose or verse?" [...] He pushed harder, stating that [...] "I plan to compose music for a prose libretto! [...] <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> that?" [...] In the end, there was a poetic version and all was well: it was accepted by the opera house and the censors.|$|E

2500|$|Taking {{advantage}} of a wind again turned to the east, resupplied and re-equipped with new horses, the invasion fleet departed again on 1/11November and sailed north {{in the direction of}} Harwich where Bentinck had a landing site prepared. The fleet changed course to the south however when the wind turned more to the north; {{it has been suggested that}} the initial move to the north was a feint and indeed James diverted some of his forces in that direction. Thus they passed twice in sight of the English fleet, which was unable to intercept because of the adverse wind and an unfavourable tide. On 3/13 November the invasion fleet entered the English Channel through the Strait of Dover in an enormous square formation, 25ships deep, the right and left of the fleet saluting Dover and Calais simultaneously, to show off its size. The troops were lined up on deck, firing musket volleys, with full colours flying and the military bands playing. Rapin de Thoyras, who was on board one of the ships, described it as the most magnificent and affecting spectacle that was ever seen by human eyes. William intended to land at Torbay but due to fog the fleet sailed past it by mistake. The wind made a return impossible and Plymouth was unsuitable as it had a garrison. At this point, with the English fleet in pursuit, Russell told Burnet: [...] "You may go to prayers, Doctor. All is over". At that moment however the wind changed and the fog lifted, enabling the fleet to sail into Torbay, near Brixham, Devon. William came ashore on 5/15November. When Burnet was ashore he hastened to William and eagerly enquired what William now intended to do. William regarded the interference in military matters by non-military personnel with disgust but he was in good humour at this moment and responded with a delicate reproof: [...] "Well, Doctor, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> predestination now?" [...] The English squadron under Lord Dartmouth was forced by the same change in wind to shelter in Portsmouth harbour. During the next two days William's army disembarked in calm weather.|$|E
