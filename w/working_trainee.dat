40|$|AbstractWith {{the shift}} towards interprofessional {{education}} to promote collaborative practice, clinical preceptors are increasingly <b>working</b> with <b>trainees</b> from various professions to provide patient care. It {{is unclear whether}} and how preceptors modify their existing precepting approach when <b>working</b> with <b>trainees</b> from other professions. There is little information on strategies {{for this type of}} precepting, and how preceptors may foster or impede interprofessional collaboration. The purpose of this qualitative description pilot study was to identify current methods preceptors use to teach trainees from other professions in the clinical setting, particularly advanced practice nursing and medical trainees, and to identify factors that support or impede this type of precepting. Data collected through observations and interviews were analyzed by the research team using thematic analysis procedures. Three major themes were identified: 1) a variety of teaching approaches and levels of engagement with trainees of different professions, 2) preceptor knowledge gaps related to curricula, goals, and scope of practice of trainees from other professions, and 3) administrative, structural and logistical elements that impact the success of precepting trainees from different professions in the clinical setting. This study has implications for faculty development and evaluation of current precepting practices in clinical settings...|$|R

40|$|A {{main goal}} in {{technical}} training is the transfer from learning situations to working situations. In {{order to gain}} more insight into the effects of maintenance training, we developed an evaluation method based on the theory of transfer. In this method, data are gathered before, during and after a course (concerning the <b>working</b> situation, <b>trainee</b> and instructor characteristics, the curriculum, learning results and work behaviour after the course). With the help of this method we evaluated a course for maintenance engineers. The research outcomes enabled us to determine the course's strong and weak points. Concerning the weak points {{we were able to}} formulate recommendations for improvement. One major finding was that course developers, instructors, trainees and their superiors should be aware of their responsibility for enhancing transfer of training...|$|R

40|$|The paper you {{are about}} to read is based on the {{following}} statements: Dealing with conflicts in the work place is a necessary part of the training of VET teachers. These processes are essential to acquire the problem solving competences that are essential when <b>working</b> with <b>trainees</b> later on. One of the fundamental prerequisites for this is one’s ability to reflect one’s very own ways of dealing with conflicts in the workplace. This can be supported e. g. through analysing a simulation of a set con-flict. A case study used this approach with students of a teaching course. This paper presents the conception that underpins this case study as wells as its results. The study is not representative due to its limited scale; yet the results clearly highlight the knowledge and strategies the students draw upon when solving conflicts. 1...|$|R
