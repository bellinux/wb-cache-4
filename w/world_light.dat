5|$|The NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Championship (Campeonato Mundial Historico de Peso Semicompleto de la NWA in Spanish) is a {{professional}} wrestling championship promoted by Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). CMLL had held the NWA <b>World</b> <b>Light</b> Heavyweight Championship for over 48 years, when {{the relationship between the}} promotion and National Wrestling Alliance broke down in March 2010. Blue Demon Jr., the president of NWA Mexico, sent letters to CMLL, telling them to stop promoting the NWA-branded championships since they were no longer part of the NWA. On August 12, 2010, CMLL debuted the new NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Championship belt and named El Texano Jr., the final CMLL-recognized NWA <b>World</b> <b>Light</b> Heavyweight Champion, as the inaugural champion.|$|E
5|$|Working as Shocker he is {{one half}} of the current CMLL World Tag Team Championship duo along with Negro Casas, a {{championship}} he has held twice before, with Mr. Niebla and L.A. Park. He is also a former holder of the CMLL <b>World</b> <b>Light</b> Heavyweight Championship, the NWA <b>World</b> <b>Light</b> Heavyweight Championship (twice) and the NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Championship. He has won the Gran Alternativa tournament in 1995, the Copa de Arena México in 2001, La Copa Junior in 2005 and CMLL Copa Revolución Mexicana in 2011.|$|E
5|$|CMLL held a 16-trios team tournament from October 25, 1991 to November 22, 1991 to {{determine}} the first ever CMLL World Trios Championship team. This was the third CMLL-branded world championship created by CMLL after the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship in May and the CMLL <b>World</b> <b>Light</b> Heavyweight Championship in September 1991. In the finals, Los Infernales (El Satánico, MS-1 and Pirata Morgan) defeated Los Brazos (El Brazo, Brazo de Oro and Brazo de Plata) to win the championship.|$|E

5|$|CMLL held {{a tournament}} to {{determine}} the next CMLL <b>World</b> <b>Light</b> Heavyweight Champion starting on January 22, 2013, and the finals were held the following week. The {{first round of the}} tournament was a 16-man torneo cibernetico elimination match, with the last two men in the match qualifying for the finals the following week on January 29. The torneo featured two teams of eight wrestling against each other; Team A consisted of Delta, El Felino, La Máscara, Mephisto, Mr. Águila, Rey Escorpión, Stuka Jr. and Volador Jr. and Team B consisted of Atlantis, Blue Panther, Diamante, Euforia, Maximo, Morphosis, Psicosis and Sagrado. The match came down to Team A's Rey Escorpión and Volado Jr. versus Team B's Euforia. Escorpión pulled off Volador Jr.'s mask and threw it to rival Euforia, causing Euforia to be disqualified, which meant that Escorpión and Volador Jr. qualified for the finals the following week. On January 29, Rey Escorpión defeated Volador Jr. in the finals to become the 13th overall CMLL <b>World</b> <b>Light</b> Heavyweight champion.|$|E
5|$|He is {{a former}} four time holder of the CMLL World Tag Team Championship, has held the NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Championship twice and the CMLL <b>World</b> <b>Light</b> Heavyweight Championship and CMLL World Trios Championship one one occasion. He has also won CMLL's CMLL Torneo Gran Alternativa and Leyenda de Azul tournaments.|$|E
5|$|In May 2011 CMLL {{declared}} the NWA <b>World</b> <b>Light</b> Heavyweight Championship vacant when the then reigning champion Shocker had to undergo knee surgery after suffering an injury and thus {{would be unable}} to defend the championship for an undetermined amount of time. CMLL decided to hold a tournament to determine the next champion, splitting the 16 man group of competitors into two groups, each of which would compete in a torneo cibernetico elimination match to find a finalist. After the two torneo cibernetico matches the two winners would face off the following week in a one-on-one best two-out-of-three falls match. Block A of the tournament took place on June 7, 2011, and saw El Hijo del Fantasma win, while Block B took place a week later on June 14 and had Rey Bucanero as the victor. The following week, on June 21, Rey Bucanero defeated El Hijo del Fantasma to become the third ever NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Champion. Bucanero became the first champion to have not also held the previous NWA <b>World</b> <b>Light</b> Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

5|$|On February 15, 1992, CMLL held a one-night, four-man tournament to crown {{the first}} ever CMLL World Welterweight Champion. The welterweight {{championship}} was the fifth CMLL branded world championship created after the CMLL World Heavyweight, CMLL <b>World</b> <b>Light</b> Heavyweight, CMLL World Trios and CMLL World Middleweight Championship. In the tournament finals Fuerza Guerrera defeated El Khalifa to win the championship.|$|E
5|$|On July 14, he {{defeated}} Guerrero for his CMLL <b>World</b> <b>Light</b> Heavyweight Championship, ending Guerrero's {{three and}} a half year title reign. He later feuded with Kenzo Suzuki and Último Guerrero. In 2008 Bucanero participated in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's World X Cup as a part of Team Mexico, who ended up winning the whole tournament. By early 2010 Bucanero returned to Los Guerreros del Atlantida.|$|E
5|$|On January 15, 2013, then-reigning {{champion}} Rush voluntarily {{gave up the}} CMLL <b>World</b> <b>Light</b> Heavyweight Championship {{as part of his}} ongoing storyline {{feud with}} then-CMLL World Heavyweight Champion El Terrible. As part of the storyline, El Terrible stated that he would not defend against someone who represented a lower weight class, so Rush moved into the Heavyweight division for a title match. CMLL held a 16-man torneo cibernetico elimination match to determine which two wrestlers should compete in the finals for the vacant title. On January 29, 2013, Rey Escorpión defeated Volador Jr. in the tournament finals to become the 13th overall champion.|$|E

5|$|CMLL has {{declared}} the championship vacant on two separate occasions, {{which meant that}} there was no champion for a period of time. Sometimes, a championship is vacated due to an injury to the reigning champion, or when a champion stoped working for the promotion, {{but in the case of}} the CMLL <b>World</b> <b>Light</b> Heavyweight Championship, there was a storyline reason behind it being declared vacant the first time. In late 2013 the light heavyweight champion Rush was working a long-running storyline rivalry with El Terrible. When El Terrible won the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship, CMLL decided to enhance the rivalry by having Rush voluntarily give up the light heavyweight championship in order to receive a CMLL World Heavyweight Championship match against El Terrible. This allowed CMLL to advance the storyline as well as move the championship off Rush without having Rush lose a match, allowing Rey Escorpión to become the next champion. The second vacancy started on May 22, 2017 when CMLL fired the then-champion Máscara.|$|E
5|$|During the summer, La Máscara {{formed a}} trio named Los Ingobernables ("The Ungovernables") with Rush and La Sombra {{with the three}} {{essentially}} wrestling as rudos and being {{referred to as the}} most hated wrestlers in the past decade. On April 8, 2016, La Máscara defeated Ángel de Oro to win the CMLL <b>World</b> <b>Light</b> Heavyweight Championship, becoming the 15th light heavyweigt champion {{in the history of the}} championship. After the match he got into an altercation with Ángel de Oro's corner man Dragon Lee. On May 13, the partnership between La Máscara and Rush came to an end, when Rush and Pierroth turned on their Los Ingobernables stablemate. Following the turn, La Máscara declared war on the entire Muñoz family, which included Rush, Pierroth, Dragon Lee and Místico. La Máscara won the 2016 Leyenda de Plata tournament when he defeated Negro Casas in the finals, held on July 22. On August 5, La Máscara accepted a challenge from Dragon Lee for a Mask vs. Mask Lucha de Apuestas between the two. On September 2 in the main event of the 83rd Anniversary Show, La Máscara was defeated by Dragon Lee and was forced to unmask and reveal his birthname. Afterwards, La Máscara reconciled with Rush.|$|E
5|$|In either late-1938 or early-1939 Lutteroth and EMLL {{declared}} that Gus Kallio, due to holding the National Wrestling Association World Middleweight Championship was also {{recognized as the}} World Middleweight Champion in Mexico. On February 19, 1939 Kallio lost the championship to EMLL wrestler Octavio Gaona, to create EMLL's main championship for the middleweight division. In 1952 EMLL joined the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and the middleweight championship was rebranded as the NWA World Middleweight Championship from that point forward. In 1989 EMLL left the NWA because the promoters {{did not want to}} deal with the internal politics of the NWA at the time. While they left the NWA they kept promoting the NWA World Middleweight Championship as well as the NWA <b>World</b> <b>Light</b> Heavyweight Championship and the NWA World Welterweight Championship that they had controlled for years.|$|E

5|$|On July 8, 2007, Dos Caras Jr. {{became the}} fourteenth overall champion. His reign lasted 533 days, but only saw him defend the title {{a few times}} times, {{defeating}} Lizmark Jr. and Último Guerrero. On December 22, 2008, Último Guerrero won the championship from Dos Caras Jr., who shortly afterwards left CMLL to work for WWE. On April 2, 2009, Último Guerrero successfully defended the title against Rey Mendoza Jr. on an independent wrestling promotion show in Gomez Palacio, marking {{the first time the}} CMLL World Heavyweight Championship was defended on a non-CMLL promoted show. After a 963-day reign and 17 successful defenses, Guerrero lost the title to Héctor Garza on August 12, 2011. The championship was vacated on November 11, 2011, after Garza left CMLL for Perros del Mal Producciones, a group of former CMLL wrestlers who broke away from the promotion in late 2011. On January 1, 2012, El Terrible became the new champion when he defeated CMLL <b>World</b> <b>Light</b> Heavyweight Champion Rush in a decision match. The two had won a torneo cibernetico match a week earlier to earn spots in the match.|$|E
5|$|Shocker jumped {{ship from}} AAA back to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre again in 2007. That same year, he teamed with Perro Aguayo Jr. and Héctor Garza in a failed bid {{to win the}} vacant CMLL World Trios Championship from Último Guerrero, Tarzan Boy and Atlantis in Mexico City on September 29, 2006. In early 2007, he entered a {{championship}} tournament for the vacant NWA International Junior Heavyweight Championship and lost to Hirooki Goto at the tournament finals in Mexico City on March 4. He and Dr. Wagner Jr. lost to Perro Aguayo Jr. and Héctor Garza in a match for the vacant WWA World Tag Team Championship in Tijuana on January 31, 2008. Shocker has defeated a number of wrestlers in Luchas de Apuestas (bet matches), including Máscara Año 2000, Tarzan Boy, Vampiro Canadiense, Halloween, Kenzo Suzuki, Marco Corleone, Emilio Charles Jr., Bestia Salvaje, Mazada, Nosawa, Sangre Chicana, Rey Bucanero, and Black Warrior. On December 14, 2010, Shocker defeated El Texano Jr. to win the NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Championship, which predecessor, the NWA <b>World</b> <b>Light</b> Heavyweight Championship, he had already held twice before. However, just five days later he suffered a patellar tendon rupture and a meniscal tear in his knee that required surgery and would sideline him for 12 to 16 weeks. On May 26, 2011, Shocker was stripped of the NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Championship. He would finally make his CMLL in-ring return on July 24. On November 16, Shocker formed a new group with Metro and CMLL newcomers Titán and Tritón. The group dissolved soon after being announced as Shocker was injured and Metro adopted a new ring persona, Diamante Azul.|$|E
5|$|On June 20, 2012, Volador Jr. {{formed the}} Los Depredadores del Aire ("The Predators of the Air") group {{alongside}} Black Warrior and Mr. Águila. Two days later, Los Depredadores del Aire defeated Los Reyes de la Atlantida (Atlantis, Delta and Guerrero Maya, Jr.) {{to win the}} Mexican National Trios Championship. For July 29, Volador Jr. traveled to Tokyo, Japan, {{in an attempt to}} regain the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship from Prince Devitt, but would eventually fail in his title challenge. The following month, Volador Jr. started a rivalry with Mr. Niebla, for which he was positioned as a tecnico even though still being a part of rudo stable Los Invasores. On October 30, Los Depredadores del Aire lost the Mexican National Trios Championship back to Los Reyes de la Atlantida. On January 22, 2013, Volador Jr. survived a torneo cibernetico to advance to a final match for the vacant CMLL <b>World</b> <b>Light</b> Heavyweight Championship against the other survivor, Rey Escorpión. On January 29, Volador Jr. was defeated in the finals of the tournament by Escorpión. Following their clash over the Reyes del Aire trophy, Volador Jr. and La Sombra were teamed up for the 2013 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles tournament, the same tournament that in 2010 was the impetus for Volador Jr.'s rudo turn. The rivals put their issues aside for the tournament defeating the teams of Guerrero Maya, Jr. and Negro Casas, La Máscara and Averno and finally Shocker and Mr. Niebla to qualify for the finals of the tournament. On March 15, 2013, at the 2013 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show, Volador Jr. and La Sombra defeated Altantis and Último Guerrero to win the Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles. The truce between La Sombra and Volador Jr. that allowed them to win the tag team tournament only lasted until the next time the two rivals were in the same ring. On Sunday, February 17, 2013, La Sombra teamed up with Marco Corleone and Místico La Nueva Era against Volador Jr., Euforia and Último Guerrero. During the match Volador Jr. attacked both La Sombra and the referee, causing a disqualification before leaving the ring and his confused partners behind. On September 13 at CMLL's 80th Anniversary Show, Volador Jr. and La Sombra defeated Atlantis and Último Guerrero in a Relevos Suicidas match and thus advanced to a Mask vs. Mask Lucha de Apuestas against each other. In the end, Volador Jr. was defeated and forced to unmask and reveal his real name.|$|E
