(Bengal cats originate from hybridization of leopard cats and domestic cats. Most Bengal cats used in Serengeti breeding programs are many generations removed from these origins and possess few genetic contributions of the wild forebears except alleles affecting coat color.)Serengetis are spotted cats, with long legs and very large, round tipped ears. They have a long neck which blends with the base of the skull without tapering. Males are generally slightly larger and heavier than females and can weigh between 10 and 15 lbs; females generally weigh between 8 and 12 lbs. Because the Bengal stock is a hybrid cat, the Serengeti is also classified as a hybrid.|$|E

This <b>wild,</b> <b>hybrid</b> Frida, a mixture of tragic bohemian, Virgin of Guadalupe, revolutionary heroine and Salma Hayek, has taken such great hold on the public imagination that it tends to obscure the historically retrievable Kahlo." [...] —Art historian Oriana Baddeley on Kahlo The Tate Modern considers Kahlo [...] "one {{of the most significant}} artists of the twentieth century", while according to art historian Elizabeth Bakewell, she is [...] "one of Mexico's most important twentieth-century figures". Kahlo's reputation as an artist developed late in her life, and even further posthumously, as during her lifetime she was primarily known as the wife of Diego Rivera and as an eccentric personality among the international cultural elite. She gradually gained more recognition in the late 1970s, when feminist scholars began to question the exclusion of female and non-Western artists from the art historical canon, and the Chicano Movement lifted her as one of their icons. The first two books about Kahlo were published in Mexico by Teresa del Conde and Raquel Tibol in 1976 and 1977, respectively, and in 1977, The Tree of Hope Stands Firm (1944) became the first Kahlo painting to be sold in an auction, netting $19,000 at Sotheby's. These milestones were followed by the first two retrospectives ever staged on Kahlo's oeuvre in 1978, one at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City and another at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago.|$|E

[...] Allan Kozinn of The New York Times lauded Wolfe's mixture of musical styles and wrote: The score draws heavily on classic Minimalist moves. Ms. Wolfe's opening movement, [...] "Some Say," [...] breaks down the phrase [...] "Some say he’s from," [...] in ways that recall Steve Reich's early tape pieces [...] "It's Gonna Rain" [...] and [...] "Come Out." [...] But where those works are based on plain speech, Ms. Wolfe turns the repeating words and phrases into sweetly harmonized vocal lines.

The third movement, [...] "Destiny," [...] is couched in dark dissonances that veer on cacophony.

The data obtained so far show that the environmental impacts of GMOs ares similar to a non transgenic crops and are related to the incorrect management of culture than the use of a transgenic cultivar. Meanwhile, the concerns are relevant and should continue to be discussed in international forums and studied in researchers institutions to elucidate the controversial results.

40|$|Hybridization between {{wild species}} and their {{domestic}} congeners often threatens {{the gene pool}} of the wild species. The last wild Bactrian camel (Camelus ferus) populations in Mongolia and China are examples of populations facing such a hybridization threat. To address this key issue in the conservation of wild camels, we analysed <b>wild,</b> <b>hybrid</b> and domestic Bactrian camels (Camelus bactrianus) originating from Mongolia, China and Austria.

40|$|Species {{integrity}} can be challenged, {{and even}} eroded, if {{closely related species}} can hybridize and produce fertile offspring of comparable fitness to that of par- ental species. The maintenance of newly diverged or closely related species therefore hinges on the establishment and effectiveness of pre- and/or post- zygotic reproductive barriers. Ecological selection, including predation, is often presumed to contribute to reduced hybrid fitness, but field evidence for a predation cost to hybridization remains elusive. Here we provide proof-of- concept for predation on hybrids being a postzygotic barrier to gene flow in the wild. Cyprinid fishes commonly produce fertile, viable hybrid offspring and therefore make excellent study organisms to investigate ecological costs to hybrids. We electronically tagged two freshwater cyprinid fish species (roach Rutilus rutilus and bream Abramis brama) and their hybrids in 2005. Tagged fish were returned to their lake of origin, exposing them to natural predation risk from apex avian predators (great cormorant, Phalacrocorax carbo). Scanning for regurgitated tags under cormorant roosts 3 – 4 years later ident- ified cormorant-killed individual fish and allowed us to directly test for a predation cost to hybrids in the <b>wild.</b> <b>Hybrid</b> individuals were found significantly more susceptible to cormorant predation than individuals from either parental species. Such ecological selection against hybrids contributes to species integrity, and can enhance species diversification. <img src="file:///page 1 image 34232 " /...|$|E

GR 9 / 1782 A – Genomic analysis of <b>wild</b> <b>hybrid</b> derivatives of Senecio squalidus x S. vulgaris using in situ hybridization. Background: It has been reported that some plants of the self-compatible species, Senecio vulgaris, produce capitula containing long-styled florets which fail to set seed when left to self-pollinate, although readily set seed when self-pollinated by hand. Aims: To determine if production of long-styled florets is associated with higher outcrossing rate in S. vulgaris, and whether long-styles occur in non-pollinated florets, whereas short-styles are present in self-pollinated florets. Methods: The frequency of long-styled florets was compared in the radiate and non-radiate variants of S. vulgaris, known to exhibit higher and lower outcrossing rates, respectively. In addition, style length was compared in emasculated florets that were either self-pollinated or left non-pollinated. Results: Long-styled florets were more frequent in the higher outcrossing radiate variant. Following emasculation, long styles occurred in non-pollinated florets, while short styles were present in self-pollinated florets. The two variants did not differ in style length within the non-pollinated or within the self-pollinated floret categories. Conclusions: A high frequency of long-styled florets is associated with higher outcrossing rate in S. vulgaris and results from delayed self-pollination and pollen germination on stigmas.

40|$|Abstract Background Hybrid zones {{represent}} valuable {{opportunities to}} observe evolution in {{systems that are}} unusually dynamic and where {{the potential for the}} origin of novelty and rapid adaptation co-occur with the potential for dysfunction. Recently initiated hybrid zones are particularly exciting evolutionary experiments because ongoing natural selection on novel genetic combinations can be studied in ecological time. Moreover, when hybrid zones involve native and introduced species, complex genetic patterns present important challenges for conservation policy. To assess variation of admixture dynamics, we scored a large panel of markers in five <b>wild</b> <b>hybrid</b> populations formed when Barred Tiger Salamanders were introduced into the range of California Tiger Salamanders. Results At three of 64 markers, introduced alleles have largely displaced native alleles within the hybrid populations. Another marker (GNAT 1) showed consistent heterozygote deficits in the wild, and this marker was associated with embryonic mortality in laboratory F 2 's. Other deviations from equilibrium expectations were idiosyncratic among breeding ponds, consistent with highly stochastic demographic effects. Conclusion While most markers retain native and introduced alleles in expected proportions, strong selection appears to be eliminating native alleles at a smaller set of loci. Such rapid fixation of alleles is detectable only in recently formed hybrid zones, though it might be representative of dynamics that frequently occur in nature. These results underscore the variable and mosaic nature of hybrid genomes and illustrate the potency of recombination and selection in promoting variable, and often unpredictable genetic outcomes. Introgression of a few, strongly selected introduced alleles should not necessarily affect the conservation status of California Tiger Salamanders, but suggests that genetically pure populations of this endangered species will be difficult to maintain. </p...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} traits linked with the successful domestication of animals is reducing their sensitivity to environmental stressors in the human controlled environment. In order to examine whether domestication selection in Atlantic salmon Salmo salar L., over approximately ten generations, has inadvertently selected for reduced responsiveness to stress, we compared the growth reaction norms of 29 <b>wild,</b> <b>hybrid</b> and domesticated families reared together under standard hatchery conditions (control) and {{in the presence of a}} stressor (reduced water level twice daily). The experiment was conducted for a 14 week period. Farmed salmon outgrew wild salmon 1 : 2. 93 in the control tanks, and no overlap in mean weight was displayed between families representing the three groups. Thus, the elevation of the reaction norms differed among the groups. Overall, growth was approximately 25 % lower in the stressed tanksl; however, farmed salmon outgrew wild salmon 1 : 3. 42 under these conditions. That farmed salmon maintained a relatively higher growth rate than the wild salmon in the stressed tanks demonstrates a lower responsiveness to stress in the farmed salmon. Thus, flatter reaction norm slopes were displayed in the farmed salmon, demonstrating reduced plasticity for this trait under these specific experimental conditions. For all growth measurements, hybrid salmon displayed intermediate values. Wild salmon displayed higher heritability estimates for body weight than the hybrid and farmed salmon in both environments. This suggests reduced genetic variation for body weight in the farmed contra wild salmon studied here. While these results may be linked to the specific families and stocks investigated, and verification in other stocks and traits is needed, these data are consistent with the theoretical predictions of domestication...|$|E

European wild swine with 36 chromosomes crossed with 38 chromosome domestic swine have produced fertile 37 chromosome offspring (UT-AEC, 1967 unpublished data). McConnell et at., (1963) and Ruddle (1965) have quantitatively analyzed the somatic chromosomes from a small number of cells of the domestic swine (2 n= 38).
