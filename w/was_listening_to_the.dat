Although this was done by contemporary merchants, it is not recommended that this method be used on ancient coin since the coin could be damaged, especially since over time silver coins can become brittle, if the silver begins to recrystallize.|$|E

It {{reminded}} me of growing up {{and listening to the}} radio and that feeling the song gave me seemed to go with the melody and basic idea I had for [...] "Fantasy." [...] I initially told Dave about the idea, and we did it. We called up the Tom Tom Club and they were really into it.|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from being}} aficionados by the 1980s thrash metal, the band has {{expressed}} {{their love of}} skateboarding, comic books, and cartoons (most notably the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles).

Initially, Bonded by Blood played the song in live performances, but after receiving positive feedback from the audience the band decided to record it.

When I called my producer about it he asked who I wanted to sing it with me and I said Kelly Clarkson, but I didn’t think we’d be able to get her. I’ve always been a big fan of hers. I love her voice and I love her style. Long story short, we got her a copy of the song and she loved it. As soon as she started singing, it became obvious {{it was going to be}} great." ...|$|E
500|$|Noel Gallagher {{began working}} on [...] "Live Forever" [...] in 1991, while working for a {{building}} company {{in his hometown of}} Manchester. After his foot was crushed by a pipe in an accident, he was given a less-strenuous job working in the storeroom, allowing him more time to write songs. One night, he <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Rolling Stones' album Exile on Main St.; while playing one of his own chord progressions, Gallagher noted that it sounded good against one of the vocal melodies from the album: [...] "It was the bit from [...] "Shine a Light" [...] that goes , [...] "May the good Lord shine a light on you"", Gallagher recalled. Gallagher incorporated the melody, changing the line to [...] "Maybe I don't really want to know". For a period afterwards, that was {{the only part of the}} song Gallagher had completed.|$|E
500|$|The other {{material}} on Eat a Peach comes from live recordings. Dowd later said, [...] "When we recorded At Fillmore East, {{we ended up}} with almost a whole other album's worth of good material, and we used [...] tracks on Eat a Peach. Again, there was no overdubbing". Dowd started the mixing process for Eat a Peach but had run overtime and was called to commitments with Crosby, Stills and Nash; longtime Allman friend and colleague Johnny Sandlin took over for the remaining mixes. Sandlin later said of the mixing process, [...] "As I mixed songs like [...] "Blue Sky," [...] I knew, of course, that I <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> last things that Duane ever played and there was just such a mix of beauty and sadness, knowing there's {{not going to be any}} more from him". He was particularly proud of his mixing work on the album, but was angry because he did not receive credit, only a [...] "special thanks." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Us Weekly, Makeba Riddick, who assisted with the song's vocal production, spoke about {{the inspiration for the}} song. Riddick explained that Ester Dean had come up with a concept for the song, and had been working with Stargate to develop it. Upon hearing it, Riddick and Rihanna expressed interest in the song but thought that some changes were needed, and sent it to Riddick for completion. Riddick also explained where the idea for some of the sexually provocative lyrics came from: [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> words and me and [...] and we were just laughing and talking about so many situations that have happened in the past and that happen to women everywhere. By the time we were done of course, we were laughing and giggling about the lyrics [...] surprisingly everybody went nuts over the song." [...] Dean explained the development of [...] "Rude Boy" [...] in {{an interview}} with The Boom Box, and said that she wanted to channel Rihanna's alter ego and use it as inspiration for the song's lyrics. Dean praised Rihanna's ability to take risks with her music, saying [...] "I think Rihanna is sexy and will say things that other chicks won't say. Even if she says let's go kiss some girls, who really cares...that's Rihanna. Music is about fantasy. This is what people want to do, but are afraid to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Pierre has {{in retrospect}} labeled {{half of the}} album's writing as being {{completed}} while inebriated {{and the other half}} while getting sober. For example, he penned the lyrics to [...] "Attractive Today" [...] and [...] "Time Turned Fragile" [...] while drunk in his apartment, in a [...] "sad and lonely place." [...] In this approach, words mostly [...] "just came out," [...] and were not substantially revised. In addition, he <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 2003 album Reconstruction Site by the Weakerthans, and found himself inspired by the songwriting of frontman John K. Samson. Pierre would often take lyrics from other bands songs for song titles; [...] "Time Turned Fragile" [...] is lifted from a lyric in Limbeck's [...] "Julia", while [...] "Together We'll Ring in the New Year" [...] was pulled from the Tom Waits song [...] "Please Wake Me Up". [...] "L.G. FUAD"—which stands for [...] "Let's Get Fucked Up and Die"—grew out of a night on Motion City Soundtrack's 2003 UK tour with The All-American Rejects, in which the latter band's merchandise manager was severely inebriated. He stood on the merchandise stand and shouted what became the song's refrain. All involved found great humor in the [...] "mantra", which went on to be printed on business cards as a joke. [...] "Hold Me Down" [...] was inspired by a former roommate of Pierre's. After she had moved out, Pierre found a portion of her math homework in a couch cushion, leading to him imagining a scenario of finding a letter from a departed lover.|$|E
2500|$|Allen's {{influence}} in the Scottsboro case was particularly important, with Yale University historian Glenda Elizabeth Gilmore contending that [...] "we might never {{have heard of the}} Scottsboro case if Sol Auerbach, using his Party name, James S. Allen, had not arrived in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in mid-July 1930." [...] Allen <b>was</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> radio in his Chattanooga apartment in March 1931 when he heard that police in Paint Rock, Alabama, had removed nine young black men from a freight train and charged them with rape. Auerbach promptly alerted the party's International Labor Defense, of the situation, which quickly became involved in the defense.|$|E
