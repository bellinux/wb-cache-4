He commissioned Gore to write the script, originally titled Hot Lunch, before selling it to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). After he was hired to direct the film, Parker rewrote the script <b>with</b> <b>Gore,</b> aiming for a darker and dramatic tone. The script's subject matter received criticism by the New York Board of Education, which prevented the production from filming in the actual High School of Performing Arts. The film was shot on location in New York City, with principal photography beginning in July 1979 and concluding after 91 days.

[...] Former Opposition Leader Kim Beazley joined Gore for a viewing and other MPs attended a special screening at Parliament House earlier in the week.

[...] Duralde believed that Mitra's character would have qualified as a [...] "memorable fierce chick" [...] if the film was not so silly. David Hiltbrand of The Philadelphia Inquirer rated Doomsday at 2.5 out of 4 stars and thought that the film was better paced than most fantasy-action films, patiently building up its action scenes to the major [...] "fireworks" [...] where other films would normally be exhausted early on.|$|E

[...] They {{had a lot of}} fun with its easy-to-learn controls, skill customization, and most of all, the varied brutal depictions of Conan's kills. [...] TeamXbox said that the combat system [...] "blossoms into a complex string of commands that will reward the user (<b>with</b> <b>gore)</b> for pressing the right buttons at the right time". The pounding, militaristic orchestra tunes accompanying the action further enhanced the critics' experience with the game.|$|E

When the Kikuyu controversy erupted in 1913 Henson once again found himself at odds <b>with</b> <b>Gore.</b> The question was whether two colonial bishops had committed heresy by taking part in an ecumenical service. Gore and his ally Bishop Weston of Zanzibar led the charge, and appear in Henson's journal as [...] "devoted, unselfish, indefatigable, eminently gifted, but ... also fanatical in temper, bigoted in their beliefs, and reckless in their methods." [...] Together with Bishop Moule, Dean Wace of Canterbury and other leaders, Henson strongly, and successfully, supported the accused bishops: [...] "The Church owes a deep debt of gratitude to the Bishops of Uganda and Mombasa." ...|$|E
