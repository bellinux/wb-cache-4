40|$|Abstract This study {{provides}} {{a detailed analysis}} of the mid-Holocene to present-day precipitation change in the Asian monsoon region. We compare for the first time results of high resolution climate model simulations with a standardised set of mid-Holocene moisture reconstructions. Changes in the simulated summer monsoon characteristics (onset, <b>withdrawal,</b> <b>length</b> and associated rainfall) and the mechanisms causing the Holocene precipitation changes are investigated. According to the model, most parts of the Indian subcontinent received more precipitation (up to 5 mm/day) at mid-Holocene than at present-day. This is related to a stronger Indian summer monsoon accompanied by an intensified vertically integrated moisture flux con-vergence. The East Asian monsoon region exhibits local inhomogeneities in the simulated annual precipitation sig-nal. The sign of this signal depends on the balance of decreased pre-monsoon and increased monsoon precipita-tion at mid-Holocene compared to present-day. Hence, rainfall changes in the East Asian monsoon domain are not solely associated with modifications in the summer monsoon circulation but also depend on changes in the mid-latitudinal westerly wind system that dominates the circulation during the pre-monsoon season. The proxy-based climate reconstructions confirm the regional dis-similarities in the annual precipitation signal and agree well with the model results. Our results highlight the importance of including the pre-monsoon season in climate studies of the Asian monsoon system and point out the complex response of this system to the Holocene insolation forcing. The comparison with a coarse climate model simulation reveals that this complex response can only be resolved in high resolution simulations...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{we propose}} an {{analytical}} model {{to determine the}} <b>withdrawal</b> cycle <b>length,</b> kanban sizes and number of kanbans simultaneously in a multi-item, multi-stage, multi-period, capacitated periodic review kanban system. Traditionally, research in kanban systems has been separated into 'design level' research, and 'shop floor level' research. In both veins of research, especially for the design level, various algorithms have been developed. However, {{it is important to}} state that there is a significant relationship between the design parameters and the operational issues, such as kanban schedules and actual lead times. Therefore, we analytically consider the interdependencies between the design and operational decisions, and evaluate their impact on each other...|$|R
30|$|In this study, a fine-grid radial {{simulation}} model was constructed and calibrated. Once the benchmarked radial {{simulation model}} was achieved, sensitivity studies {{were performed to}} investigate the effects of depletion scheme and reservoir property parameters on the ultimate recoveries. The investigated factors were gas <b>withdrawal</b> rate, completion <b>length,</b> aquifer size, reservoir horizontal permeability, and permeability anisotropy. From {{the results of the}} sensitivity studies, an optimum production scheme was recommended to maximize ultimate recoveries while reducing total water production.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{relative}} performance of different investment strategies for {{different structures of}} the payout phase. In particular, it looks at whether the specific glide-path of life-cycle investment strategies {{and the introduction of}} dynamic features in the design of default investment strategies affect significantly retirement income outcomes. The analysis concludes that there is no “one-size-fits-all” default investment option. Life-cycle and dynamic investment strategies deliver comparable replacement rates adjusted by risk. However, life-cycle strategies that maintain a constant exposure to equities during most of the accumulation period, switching swiftly to bonds in the last decade before retirement, seem to produce better results and are easier to explain. Dynamic management strategies can provide somewhat higher replacement rates for a given level of risk than the more deterministic strategies, at least in the case of pay-outs in the form of variable <b>withdrawals.</b> The <b>length</b> of the contribution period also affects the ranking of the different investment strategies with life-cycle strategies having a stronger positive impact the shorter is the contribution period. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of milk withdrawal, stable routines and separation from dam on suckling behaviour of beef calves was tested in an 8 x 8 Latin square experiment. Length {{of the meal}} and length of the longest bout were measured to describe the meal as a whole. Length of pre-stimulation, increasing ejection, declining ejection, and afterstimulation were measured to describe the structure of meal. Eagerness of suckling was described as relative suckling time and non-suckling. Milk <b>withdrawal</b> increased <b>length</b> of meal and longest bout, but did not influence structure of meal. Milk withdrawal resulted in cistern-milk being available already before ejection and thereby in longer bouts during pre-stimulation. Milk withdrawal had no influence on eagerness of suckling. Stable routines had no influence on meal as a whole, but increased pre- and decreased after-stimulation and tended to result in somewhat longer bouts during pre-stimulation. There was no {{influence of}} stable routines on eagerness of suckling. Separation from dam had no influence on meal as a whole or structure of meal, but increased eagerness of suckling for the whole meal and for almost all periods. The experimental results partially sustained results from a field study...|$|R
40|$|This work {{reports a}} temperature-assisted {{dip-coating}} method for self-assembly of silica (SiO 2) micro-/nano-spheres (SPs) as monolayers over large areas (~cm 2). The area over which self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are formed {{can be controlled}} by tuning the suspension temperature (Ts), which allows precise control over meniscus shape. Furthermore, the formation of periodic stripes of SAM, with excellent dimensional control (stripe width and stripe-to-stripe spacing), is demonstrated using a suitable set of dip-coating parameters. These findings establish the role of Ts, and other parameters such as withdrawal speed (Vw), withdrawal angle (θw) and <b>withdrawal</b> step <b>length</b> (Lw). For Ts ranged between 25 - 80 oC, the morphological analysis of dip-coatings shows layered structures comprising of defective layers (25 - 60 oC), single layers (70 oC), and multi-layer (> 70 oC) owing to the variation of SPs flux at the meniscus/substrate assembling interface. At Ts= 70 oC, there is an optimum Vw, approximately equal to the downshift speed of the meniscus (Vm = 1. 3 μm/s), which allows the SAM formation over areas (2. 25 cm 2) roughly 10 times larger than reported in literature using nanospheres. Finally, the large-area SAM is used to demonstrate the enhanced performance of anti-reflective coatings for photovoltaic cells, and to create metal nano-mesh for Si nanowire synthesis...|$|R

If immediate treatment for withdrawal is not required major symptoms do not subsequently occur with great frequency. Late withdrawal signs were not seen in this study...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to identify, review, and {{critically}} appraise the quality of reviews and trials in the international research literature on drug misuse concerning the (cost-) effectiveness of inte rventions, and the demographic and programme factors that influence treatment outcomes. A systematic search of databases, journals, and the grey literature was carried out from 1990 to 2002. Studies were included if they had enrolled clients who were aged 18 years or over, were dependent on opiates, and were involved in a community maintenance, community detoxification or residential rehabilitation treatment programme. The methodological quality of effectiveness studies was assessed using Cochrane Collaboration and CASP guidelines. The methodological quality of reviews of effectiveness studies was examined in terms of search strategy, in/exclusion criteria, design and quality assessment of primary studies, number and dates of primary studies, method of combining effectiveness estimates, and scope for bias. The primary outcome measures studied were abstinence from opiate use, reduction in illicit opiate use, <b>withdrawal</b> severity, <b>length</b> of stay, and retention in treatment. The cost-effectiveness literature was expected to be small and, hence, a very general search was conducted to avoid the possibility of missing relevant articles. A systematic search of electronic databases was undertaken from 1990 to 2002 to identify any study that included some form of economic evaluation even if this was not complete. Studies where a passing reference to costs or costeffectiveness was given without any supporting data were excluded. Economic evaluations were assessed against a checklist. This considered, inter alia, the choice of comparator, the scope of the costs and benefits included, the sources of data on costs and outcomes, the detail with which cost data were reported, the use of discounting and sensitivity analysis, where appropriate, and the relevance of results to the U.

40|$|To {{understand}} the role of Mycobacterium smegmatis ftsZ (ftsZ smeg) in the cell division process, the ftsZ gene was characterized at the genetic level. This study shows that ftsZ smeg is an essential gene in that {{it can only be}} disrupted in a merodiploid background carrying another functional copy. Expression of ftsZ smeg in M. smegmatis from a constitutively active mycobacterial promoter resulted in lethality whereas that from a chemically inducible acetamidase (ami) promoter led to FtsZ accumulation, filamentation and cell lysis. To further {{understand the}} roles of ftsZ in cell division a conditionally complementing ftsZ smeg mutant strain was constructed in which ftsZ expression is controlled by acetamide. Growth in the presence of 0 ? 2 % acetamide increased FtsZ levels approximately 1 ? 4 -fold, but did not decrease viability or change cell <b>length.</b> <b>Withdrawal</b> of acetamide reduced FtsZ levels, decreased viability, increased cell length and eventually lysed the cells. Finally, it is shown that ftsZsmeg function in M. smegmatis can be replaced with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis counterpart, indicating that heterologous FtsZtb can independently initiate the formation of Z-rings and catalyse the septation process. It is concluded that optimal levels of M. smegmatis FtsZ are required to sustain cell division and that the cell division initiation mechanisms are similar in mycobacteria...|$|R
40|$|Boron (B) {{deficiency}} limits reproductive growth {{more than}} vegetative growth in cereals such as wheat. The {{purpose of the}} present study was to identify the critical stages of anther development of wheat (‘Wilgoyne’) during which B deficiency causes a significant and irreversible decrease of floret fertility in order to formulate timely measures for correcting or preventing this problem. Withdrawing B from the rooting medium for 3 d between premeiotic interphase through meiosis to late tetrad, limited anther elongation and resulted in the loss of pollen viability. The negative effects of B <b>withdrawal</b> on anther <b>length</b> suggest that the role of B in reproductive cell walls is similar to that in vegetative ones. The results indicated that as more florets reached meiosis within the period of B withdrawal, the lower was floret fertility and the number of grains set in a whole ear. For the whole ear, the critical period during which B deficiency causes maximal and irreversible damage to floret fertility was about 7 d, extending from the early emergence of the flag leaf to 2 – 3 d after its full emergence. The results suggest that there are two phases of pollen development sensitive to boron deficiency: the period from premeiotic interphase through meiosis to late tetrad was the most sensitive stage of microsporogenesis in wheat while the period from mitosis-I to II during which starch accumulation occurred in pollen grains was less sensitive...|$|R
40|$|Customer-side {{influences}} on insurance {{have been relatively}} ignored in the literature. Using the household as the unit of analysis, {{this article focuses on}} the behavior of households having multiple policies of different types with the same insurance company, and who cancel their first policy. How long after the household's cancellation of the first policy does the insurer have to retain the customer and avoid customer defection on all policies to the competition? And, what customer characteristics are associated with customer loyalty? Using logistic regression and survival analysis techniques, an assessment is made of the probability of total customer <b>withdrawal,</b> and the <b>length</b> of time between first cancellation and subsequent customer withdrawal. Using a European database spanning 54 months of household multiple policyholder behavior, the results show that cancellation of one policy is a very strong indicator that other household policies will be canceled. Further, the insurer can have time to react to retain the customer after the first cancellation, however, this time is significantly dependent on the method used to contact the company, household demographics, {{and the nature of the}} household's insurance policy portfolio. Surprisingly, core customers having three or more policies in addition to the canceled policy are more vulnerable to total defection on all policies than noncore customers. Further, the potential customer repelling effects of premium increases seem to wear out after 12 months. Strategic implications of the results are presented.
