5000|$|Before {{and during}} 1937, two paint companies, Kay & Ess and Chadeloid Chemical Co., were in patent {{litigation}} with each other. Each company claimed that it controlled the basic patents on <b>wrinkle</b> <b>finish,</b> and each company {{contended that the}} patents of the other {{could not be used}} without infringing its own patents. In November 1937 they decided to settle the litigation by forming a new, jointly-owned company, New Wrinkle, to which they assigned their patents. They agreed that they would license the wrinkle-finish industry to make and sell at fixed prices. Kay & Ess and Chadeloid then worked together to induce all manufacturers of <b>wrinkle</b> <b>finish</b> products to accept the price-fixing patent licenses from New Wrinkle. The prospective licensees were assured that the other manufacturers were being dealt with on the same basis [...] "in order to establish minimum prices throughout the industry." [...] By September 1938 the leading manufacturing companies and some 200 other manufacturers—substantially all manufacturers of <b>wrinkle</b> <b>finishes</b> in the United States—held nearly identical ten-year extendable license agreements from New Wrinkle, fixing prices. These license agreements required that a licensee observe in all sales of products covered by the licensed patents a schedule of minimum prices, discounts, and selling terms. Unlike its organizers, Kay & Ess and Chadeloid, New Wrinkle does not manufacture and sell the patented products. It just owns and licenses the patents.|$|R

50|$|The Impressionists' {{progress}} toward a brighter style of painting was gradual. During the 1860s, Monet and Renoir sometimes painted on canvases prepared with the traditional red-brown or grey ground. By the 1870s, Monet, Renoir, and Pissarro usually chose to paint on grounds of a lighter grey or beige colour, which functioned as a middle tone in the <b>finished</b> <b>painting.</b> By the 1880s, some of the Impressionists had come to prefer white or slightly off-white grounds, and no longer allowed the ground colour {{a significant role in}} the <b>finished</b> <b>painting.</b>|$|R

The sketch is currently displayed at the Tate Gallery, London, while the <b>finished</b> <b>painting</b> now hangs in the Yale Center for British Art at New Haven, United States. Constable's painting, [...] "one of his most monumental works" [...] according to art historians Tammis Groft and Mary Mackay, shows Hadleigh Castle as a decaying man-made structure, succumbing to the elemental power of nature.|$|R

40|$|AbstractBy {{utilizing}} the self-designed test platform {{to carry out}} tests on the edge ignition time and center ignition time of wooden panels coated with <b>finishing</b> fire-retardant <b>paints</b> to different fire-retardant degrees and analyzing the factors affecting the edge ignition time and center ignition time, this paper proposes the indicators {{for the assessment of}} fire-retardant properties of wooden panels coated with <b>finishing</b> fire-retardant <b>paints,</b> i. e. the edge ignition time and the center ignition time. It is indicated by research results that the paint quality, coating process and fire-retardant properties of wooden panels coated with <b>finishing</b> fire-retardant <b>paints</b> can be comprehensively assessed in terms of these two indicators; the edge ignition time can be used for auxiliary assessment of the quality situation of <b>finishing</b> fire-retardant <b>paints,</b> and the center ignition time can be used for assessment of the coating process of <b>finishing</b> fire-retardant <b>paints...</b>|$|R
