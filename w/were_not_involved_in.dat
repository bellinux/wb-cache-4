5|$|Because of {{regulations}} {{imposed by the}} Writers Guild of America, only those employed as writers for Saturday Night Live were allowed to write sketches for the program. Henson and his puppeteers merely performed the scripts for the segments—they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the writing process. Saturday Night Live cast members did not enjoy working with The Land of Gorch segments. Writing assignments for The Land of Gorch sketches were given to Saturday Night Live staff as a penalty for being the least-liked among the production team. Writers generally regarded the routines as childish.|$|E

The Nine Network <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the follow-up series. The series premiered on Nick Jr. on 4 November 2013, and ran until 2016.|$|E
5|$|In April 1925 the United States Post Office issued three stamps {{commemorating the}} 150th {{anniversary of the}} Battles at Lexington and Concord. The Lexington—Concord {{commemorative}} stamps were {{the first of many}} commemoratives issued to honor the 150th anniversaries of events that surrounded America's War of Independence. The three stamps were first placed on sale in Washington, D.C. and in five Massachusetts cities and towns that played major roles in the Lexington and Concord story: Lexington, Concord, Boston, Cambridge, and Concord Junction (as West Concord was then known). This {{is not to say that}} other locations <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the battles.|$|E

A case of poisoning that may have been caused by S.thiersii has been reported from the state of Puebla, Mexico. The outcome of this case is unknown.

5|$|In late August, the 7th Battalion, with a {{frontage}} {{equal to}} just over half its authorised strength, was transferred to Ypres, in Belgium, where they manned trenches near the Ypres–Commines canal. During this time they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> any major attacks, however, each night they sent patrols out into no man's land and established listening posts to gather intelligence. On 30 September, the 7th Battalion, along with its sister battalion, the 8th Battalion, mounted a raid on the German line at Hollebeke with a force roughly equivalent to two platoons. The raid was a great success, with the Australians overwhelming the defenders and capturing {{a section of the}} German line and killing up to 13 Germans, before withdrawing.|$|E
5|$|The VRS {{leadership}} {{estimated the}} total {{strength of the}} opposing forces at 25,500 troops. In their estimate they included the 110th and 111th Brigades of the HVO from Usora and Žepče, as well as three brigades of the ARBiH from Gradačac, Maglaj and Tešanj. Although these units <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the fighting in Posavina, they tied {{a part of the}} VRS forces on their own positions. Besides manpower, the VRS also held an advantage in armaments. While the Croat forces had 47 combat vehicles, 35 of which were tanks (9 T-34s, 22 T-55s and 4 M-84s), the VRS had 163 combat vehicles, including three PT-76s, 18 T-34s, 71 T-55s and 24 M-84s. The VRS held an advantage in artillery pieces as well.|$|E

5|$|The gun gallery was {{situated}} in the Recreation Yard and mounted {{on one of the}} dining hall's exterior walls. There was a metal detector outside of the dining hall for security purposes. The dining hall had tear-gas canisters attached to the rafters of the ceiling which could be activated by remote control, should prisoners riot or attempt to escape. The first warden, James A. Johnston, always entered the dining hall alone and unarmed, due to heavy guarding around him. Several riots did break out in the dining hall during Alcatraz's history. Those prisoners who <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the fighting hid under the dining hall tables to escape possible gunfire.|$|E
5|$|Between 2:00 pm and 5:00 pm {{approximately}} 800 prisoners had surrendered, and {{arrangements were}} made {{for them to be}} transferred to other prisons. At 8:00 pm Governor O'Friel agreed that prison officers should enter E wing, and at 8:05 pm approximately ten Control & Restraint (C) units each consisting of twelve prison officers entered the wing. By 8:10 pm all four landings of E wing had been secured, and one C unit progressed to the Centre where they fought with rioting prisoners. This was reported to Governor O'Friel, who instructed the officers not to move beyond E wing. Scaffolding poles and other missiles were thrown at the C teams from the roof area above the fourth landing in E wing, and when prisoners broke onto the wing the C teams withdrew at 0:22 am on 2 April, leaving prisoners in control of the wing. Up to 1,100 of the 1,647 prisoners were involved in the rioting, {{and by the end of}} the first day 700 had surrendered and been transferred to other prisons along with 400 prisoners who <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the rioting. Between 200 and 350 prisoners occupied the rooftop of the main prison during the night.|$|E
5|$|Ganino and Stillwell {{completed}} their new combined story {{in about a}} week. The writers spent hours each day at Stillwell's apartment working over every detail; they felt pressured {{to write a story}} Piller would find acceptable, as they wanted {{to have the opportunity to}} write the teleplay. The story treatment was turned in on October 10. Piller immediately decided to purchase the story and distributed the treatment to the writing staff while he discussed changes. Piller felt that Data's romantic feelings for TashaYar were over the top, and that an alien probe which served as a central part of the story was a cheat in terms of resolving Picard's dilemma. The writer wanted Ganino and Stillwell to enhance Guinan's role and to find another character arc for TashaYar. A revised treatment was submitted on October 29, incorporating Piller's changes. The writers <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> development of the teleplay. They were each paid the Writers Guild minimum of $2400.|$|E

5|$|Japan's bomb-damaged {{cities were}} rebuilt after the war. War damage {{and the need}} to rehouse {{soldiers}} and civilians returning from overseas resulted in a shortage of 4.2million units of housing which, combined with food shortages, led to many civilians being forced to live in harsh conditions. In September 1945 the Japanese government offered to provide material for 300,000 small temporary houses to evacuees, but the emphasis of its policies in this year and 1946 was to stop people returning to the damaged cities. The reconstruction of 115 cities began in 1946, and this work was conducted in line with guidelines developed by the Japanese government. The Allied occupation authorities <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the urban rebuilding effort, but allowed this work to go ahead despite criticizing it as inappropriate to Japan's status as a defeated country. Requisitions of land and buildings for use by the occupation force and a requirement that the Japanese government prioritize the construction of housing for the Allied troops interfered with reconstruction, however. In many cities rebuilding was accompanied by a process of land readjustment which sought to improve the urban layout, though the success of both such readjustment and rebuilding programs varied between locations. Overall, most of the new buildings constructed were of poor quality, and it was not until well after the war that major urban improvement projects were undertaken.|$|E
5|$|The race ended early when {{a second}} red flag was waved on lap 46, and its results {{were taken from}} the running order at the end of lap 44. This gave Hamilton the victory, with {{teammate}} Rosberg in second. Vettel took third, ahead of his Red Bull teammate Ricciardo. Button finished fifth, ahead of Massa and Bottas in sixth and seventh. Hülkenberg, Vergne and Pérez rounded out the points-scoring positions. Kvyat, Räikkönen and Gutiérrez filled the next three positions (one lap behind the race winner), with Magnussen, Grosjean, Maldonado, Ericcson, Chilton and Kobayashi the last of the classified finishers who <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> any incident. Bianchi and Sutil were classified in 20th and 21st, despite their accidents. There were three lead changes in the race; two drivers reached the front of the field. Rosberg's total of 26 laps led was the highest of any competitor. Hamilton led two different times, for a total of 18 laps. Hamilton's victory was his eighth of the season, his first at Suzuka, and the 30th of his Formula One career.|$|E
