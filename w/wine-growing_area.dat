25|$|The <b>wine-growing</b> <b>area</b> {{was first}} {{mentioned}} {{by the name}} Tokaj in 1067. The town itself was first mentioned in documents in 1353. Its first castle was a motte, which was destroyed during the Mongol invasion of Hungary. By the 14th century the town already had a stone castle, belonging to the Diósgyőr estate.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} processes attracted many craftsman, {{merchants and}} artists with such talented ones among them as Kracker János Lukács, Anton Maulberts, Franz Sigrist, Josef Gerl, Jakab Fellner and Henrik Fasola. The town population grew suddenly. While in 1688 {{it was only}} 1200, in 1787 more than 17,000 people lived here. At this time, Eger was the 6th largest town of Hungary (based {{on the number of}} its inhabitants). Viticulture also reached its brightest period in these days. The <b>wine-growing</b> <b>area</b> was twelve times larger than it had been earlier.|$|E
25|$|According to the {{conclusions}} of two studies published in the United States (one of which was conducted by the Colmar branch of l'INRA (Institut National de Recherche Agronomique or French National Institute for Agricultural Research) on the consequences of global warming for wine-growing, the Loire Valley <b>wine-growing</b> <b>area</b> {{should be one of}} the prime beneficiaries of the gradual increase in temperatures. Basing their calculations on Sotheby's auction statistics, these studies suggest that {{in the last ten years}} the optimum temperature for producing quality wine has already been reached in most French wine-growing areas, but that there is a margin for potential improvement of about 0.8°C along the banks of the Loire. If these conclusions are right, the wines of this region could, in fact, reach their peak without the need for any changes in the grape varieties grown.|$|E

25|$|The wide {{valley of}} the Loire {{is made up of}} a mixture of sand and silt that is carried along by the river. The slopes on either side are made up of a mixture of clays and other {{elements}} that have come down from the plateau areas. The <b>wine-growing</b> <b>area</b> is mainly located on the two halves of the plateau and, occasionally, on the upper slopes to either side of the valley. The plateau areas are covered in a thin layer of clay-sand silt that has been deposited there by the wind. Beneath this silt lies a polygenetic puddingstone dating from the Upper Eocene Age, mixed with varicoloured clays and small pebbles of rolled silex, Jurassic cherts and quartz grains. The soils of this wine-growing terroir can be carbonate, overlying tuffeau stone on the higher slopes, or, more frequently, silicate and fairly heavy, overlying sands and clay gravels.|$|E

The commune of Saint-Règle (on the left bank) was added to the appellation by the decree of 2 August 2005. In 1967 the Commanderie des Grands Vins d'Amboise (the Order of the Great Wines of Amboise) was established to ensure that the wines were well promoted.|$|E
2500|$|The tiny {{hamlet of}} Wyhl, located {{just outside the}} Kaiserstuhl <b>wine-growing</b> <b>area</b> in the southwestern corner of Germany, was first {{mentioned}} in 1971 as a possible site for a nuclear power station. In the years that followed, local opposition steadily mounted, but this had little impact on politicians and planners. Official permission for the plant was granted and earthworks began on 17 February 1975. On 18 February, local people spontaneously occupied the site and police removed them forcibly two days later. [...] Television coverage of police dragging away farmers and their wives through the mud helped to turn nuclear power into a major national issue. The rough treatment was widely condemned and made the wine-growers, clergy, and others all the more determined. Some local police refused {{to take part in}} the action.|$|E

[...] Nevertheless the wine-growers' unions have succeeded at many levels in keeping production at full capacity. [...] In the Touraine area, however, {{there is no such}} flurry of activity. [...] In his report to the General Council of the department of Indre-et-Loire, the Prefet (official in charge of a French department) does not even mention the situation.

2500|$|The {{writer of}} {{regional}} literature, Robert Morin (1893–1925) {{was the author}} of Mélie Buttelière (Mélie the Basket Carrier), which was published posthumously in 1926. In the 1920s Morin lived in the Ménard manor house at Pocé-sur-Cisse. His heroine, Mélie, lived half way up a hillside in a cave-dwelling between the hamlets of Fourchette and Moncé in Limeray, right {{in the heart of the}} present AOC <b>wine-growing</b> <b>area.</b> Her job was to carry the soil washed down the hillsides by the rain back up the slopes again, earthing up the base of each vine. The small basket she used was known locally as a [...] "buttelet", and is the root of the word [...] "buttelière" [...] (basket carrier), Mélie's job title. [...] By depicting a few brief scenes from her existence, the author painted a vivid picture of the lives and characterful speech of the local wine-growing community in the early 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} century AD the geographer, Pliny the Elder (23-79 AD), [...] {{described}} wine-growing in Gaul as well-developed, but made no specific mention of wines produced {{along the banks of}} the Loire. [...] Whereas the Nantes <b>wine-growing</b> <b>area</b> dates back to the Roman occupation, popular tradition links the start of vine cultivation in the province of Touraine (in the middle section of the Loire's course) to the founding of Marmoutier Abbey by St Martin in 372 AD. The fall of the Roman empire, and the turbulent centuries of the early Middle Ages that followed, interrupted the development of wine production, and the use of wine was restricted to religious practices and medical applications, in both cases dispensed by monasteries. This was documented by Sulpicius Severus, writing about meals at Marmoutier Abbey at the end of the 4th century: [...] "Everyone gathered to break the fast and eat together; there was no wine provided except when illness demanded it". Several legends about the effects of drinking wine or pruning vines are linked to St Martin of Tours.|$|E
