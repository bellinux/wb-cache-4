25|$|In 1914 the Australian {{economy was}} small but very nearly the most propserous {{in the world}} per capita; it {{depended}} on the export of wool and mutton. London provided assurances that it would underwrite {{a large amount of}} the war risk insurance for shipping in order to allow trade amongst the Commonwealth nations to continue. London imposed controls so that no exports would <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> German hands.

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{armistice}} (25 June 1940) France {{had been allowed}} to retain the French Navy, the Marine Nationale, under strict conditions. The Pétain government pledged that the fleet would never fall into German hands, but refused to send the fleet beyond Germany's reach, either to Britain, or even to far away territories of the French Empire, such as the West Indies. This was not enough security for Winston Churchill, who feared that the French fleet could <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> German hands and be used against British ships, which were vital to maintaining worldwide shipping and communications.|$|E

25|$|The 1977–78 season {{represents}} {{the most significant}} in Centennials history as the team would experience achievements yet to be matched. Buoyed {{by the addition of}} players like Ken Stroud, Rob Polman-Tuin, and Kelly Ferner, and the development of returnees like Beers and Sirkia, the Cents rocketed {{to the top of the}} BCJHL standings, finishing the season with a record of 50–15–1 for a franchise record 101 points. That total stands as the fourth most ever points accumulated by one team in a season in BCHL history. The Cents racked up an astonishing 489 goals that season, led by six different players with 90 points or more. Stroud, Ferner, Beers, and Sirkia would all <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the BCJHL's top 15 in scoring, each with more than 111 points while Pat Rabbitt and Blake Stephen chipped in with 93 points each. Merritt also had four 50-plus goal scorers in Stroud, Ferner, Beers, and Rabbitt. Stroud's 86 assists that season still stands as a team record.|$|E

He manipulates her with gifts of money and clothing in return for sexual favors. Paranoid and jealous, Humbert controls Dolores's movements carefully and forbids her from associating with other teenagers. After a year of touring the United States, Humbert takes Dolores to settle in the fictional New England town of Beardsley, and enrolls her in a girls' school {{at the start of}} the school year where Humbert reluctantly grants Dolores permission to join the school play which, unbeknownst to Humbert, was written by Quilty.

500|$|Mills portrayed Abby from 1980–1989. Prior {{to being}} cast in Knots Landing, Mills was {{primarily}} known {{for playing the}} [...] "damsel in distress" [...] archetype in both film and television media. The actress became somewhat famous for playing these roles, often leading to unwanted typecasting. In an interview with Jerry Buck for the Toledo Blade, Mills said: [...] "I got tired of playing the victim. It's a more active role. Abby keeps things stirred up, and I like that." [...] According to Jacobs, Abby was not planned when the show began. He knew that he wanted a female J.R. Ewing-esque character. However, he had a different sense of the character and who would <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the role. With Mills' reputation of playing the victim, he initially didn't choose her for the part.|$|E
500|$|By November 1936, 16,170 pieces {{had been}} sold. Only about 2,000 more {{were sold in}} the next four months; Hoffecker's {{statement}} for March 1937 shows 18,790 sold with an additional 330 on consignment to the First National Bank of Elgin. Rovelstad had received $8,680.00 and Hoffecker $6,576.50. [...] At this point, discussion turned to {{what to do with the}} remaining pieces, some 5,620 (a few hundred pieces were given away or otherwise disposed of). [...] Rovelstad agreed to allow the coin dealer to purchase 250 pieces at $1 each; he was still selling them in 1948. [...] Other dealers were uninterested in large purchases as the direct sale to collectors meant that few who wanted and could afford the Elgin coin lacked it. With demand at a standstill, Hoffecker feared that the remaining pieces would <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the hands of speculators. [...] Five thousand pieces were returned to the Mint for melting.|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{his more}} stridently [...] "non-interventionist" [...] father, Paul concedes {{a role for}} American armed forces abroad, {{including}} permanent foreign military bases. He {{has said that he}} blames supporters of the Iraq War and not President Obama for the growth in violence that occurred in 2014, and that the Iraq War [...] "emboldened" [...] Iran. Dick Cheney, John McCain and Rick Perry have responded by calling Paul an isolationist, but Paul has pointed to opinion polls of likely GOP primary voters as support for his position. Paul stated: [...] "I personally believe that this group [...] would not be in Iraq and would not be as powerful had we not been supplying their allies in the war [...]" [...] Paul then supported airstrikes against ISIS, but questioned the constitutionality of Obama's unilateral actions without a clear congressional mandate. Paul has stated concerns about arms sent to Syrian rebels that <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> unfriendly hands. In 2015, Paul called for a defense budget of $697 billion in 2016. In 2011, shortly after being elected, he proposed a budget which specified $542 billion in defense spending.|$|E

500|$|The Marble Index [...] "failed to {{challenge}} the supremacy of Nashville Skyline, From Elvis in Memphis, Abbey Road and Diana Ross & the Supremes Join the Temptations on the album charts of 1969". Although Holzman {{was pleased with the}} album, Nico's longevity with the label was unlikely; he was increasingly concerned with her heroin use and she had a difficult, irresponsible attitude. Nico left the United States before she was officially released from Elektra, after a violent incident in a New York City bar. Biographers refer to her leaving the U.S. as an exile; Nico said, [...] "When you live in a dangerous place, you also become increasingly dangerous. You might just <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> jail." [...] In London she recorded two more albums with Cale in the same vein: Desertshore (1970) and The End... (1974), now considered parts of a trilogy. The album was reissued as a CD in 1991 with two bonus tracks. Songs off The Marble Index have been included in Nico compilations, including The Classic Years (1998), Femme Fatale (2002), and The Frozen Borderline – 1968–1970 (2007). To celebrate Elektra's 60th anniversary, [...] "Frozen Warnings" [...] was released as a single on October 25, 2010, with [...] "No One Is There" [...] as its B-side.|$|E
