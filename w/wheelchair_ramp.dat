5|$|Later in the decade, Portland {{upgraded}} City Hall {{by adding}} fire sprinklers and smoke detectors. In 1973, the sandstone exterior was cleaned and sealed to prevent moisture from eroding the fragile stone.

25|$|In 1982, SEPTA ordered buses from Neoplan USA, a {{purchase}} {{that was both}} the largest for Neoplan {{at the time and}} SEPTA's largest to date.

The Neoplan AK's (numbered 8285–8410), which was SEPTA's first Neoplan order, had longitudinal seating: all of the seats face towards the aisle. However, their suburban counterparts (8411–8434) had longitudinal seating only {{in the rear of the}} bus. The back door has a <b>wheelchair</b> <b>ramp,</b> which forced SEPTA officials to limit its use and specify wheelchair lifts in their next order. These buses had a nine-liter 6v92 engine and Allison HT-747 transmission.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the plays, beginning in 1951 a free outdoor [...] "Green Show" [...] drawing audiences of 600 to 1200, often including non-playgoers, has preceded the evening plays from June through October from a modular steel stage with a sprung floor for the dancers, a removable <b>wheelchair</b> <b>ramp</b> for handicapped performers, and built-in storage facilities that eliminate carting equipment from and to distant storage facilities six days a week. Originally, it offered Elizabethan music and dancers. From 1966 till 2007, it consisted of three Renaissance-themed shows in rotation inspired by the plays showing in the Allen Elizabethan Theatre. [...] Live music was supplied by the Terra Nova Consort and other guest musicians and modern dance was performed by Dance Kaleidoscope. In 2008, the Green Show was revamped. The nightly shows now vary widely with performers such as a dance group from Mexico or India one night, clowns doing ballet on stilts the next, and a classical music quartet on another.

2500|$|Galehead Hut (...) lies nearly [...] {{above sea}} level on rugged Garfield Ridge. Construction on the {{original}} structure there began in 1931, using wood from the surrounding trees. It was completed in 1932, along with Zealand Falls Hut, its closest northern neighbor. A small space under the front porch was used to store perishable foods. In 1938, Galehead gained a temporary 360degree view when the Great New England Hurricane blew over all the surrounding trees. It was replaced in June 2000 with a new Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant hut, complete with a <b>wheelchair</b> <b>ramp</b> {{even though it is}} [...] of rough trail from the nearest trailhead. Given its altitude and remoteness, {{the vast majority of the}} new structure's materials had to be carried in; thus mainly lightweight materials were utilized. New features include composting toilets (already in use at Mizpah Spring Hut, Carter Notch Hut, and Lonesome Lake Hut), both solar panels and a wind vane for producing power, and a foundation fastened to the granite bedrock with grouted rebar, giving the hut the ability to withstand winds up to [...] The hut is [...] from the summit of South Twin Mountain and [...] from the summit of Galehead Mountain.
