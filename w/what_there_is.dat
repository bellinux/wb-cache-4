Geraldton tides follow a diurnal pattern, with maximum tidal ranges of around 1-metre (3ft).|$|E
25|$|The boat {{is first}} {{directly}} addressed in chapter 43; there Gangleri asks that, if Skíðblaðnir {{is the best}} of ships, <b>what</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> to know about it, and asks if there is no other ship as good or as large as it. High responds that while Skíðblaðnir is the finest ship and the most ingeniously created, the biggest ship is in fact Naglfar, which is owned by Muspell. The Sons of Ivaldi, who High adds are dwarfs, crafted the ship and gave it to Freyr. High continues that the ship is big enough for all of the gods to travel aboard it with wargear and weapons in tow, and that, as soon as its sail is hoisted, the ship finds good wind, and goes wherever it need be. It is made up of so many parts and with such craftsmanship that, when it is not needed at sea, it may be folded up like cloth and placed into one's pocket. Gangleri comments that Skíðblaðnir sounds like a great ship, and that it must have taken a lot of magic to create something like it.|$|E

Though Aden later gives Belle a second chance when she recovers. With this Lasance later reaffirmed his belief that [...] "no matter <b>what</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> always a deep-rooted connection that can't be broken" [...] between Aden and Belle.

[...] Aden gives up the chance of attending university to stay with Belle and takes up a [...] "job of convenience" [...] working on the prawn trawler.|$|E
500|$|In chapter 42, Sleipnir's origins are described. Gangleri (described {{earlier in}} the book as King Gylfi in disguise) asks High who the horse Sleipnir belongs to and <b>what</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> to tell about it. High expresses {{surprise}} in Gangleri's {{lack of knowledge about}} Sleipnir and its origin. High tells a story set [...] "right {{at the beginning of the}} gods' settlement, when the gods established Midgard and built Val-Hall" [...] about an unnamed builder who has offered to build a fortification for the gods in three seasons that will keep out invaders in exchange for the goddess Freyja, the sun, and the moon. After some debate, the gods agree to this, but place a number of restrictions on the builder, including that he must complete the work within three seasons with the help of no man. The builder makes a single request; that he may have help from his stallion Svaðilfari, and due to Loki's influence, this is allowed. The stallion Svaðilfari performs twice the deeds of strength as the builder, and hauls enormous rocks to the surprise of the gods. The builder, with Svaðilfari, makes fast progress on the wall, and three days before the deadline of summer, the builder was nearly at the entrance to the fortification. The gods convene, and figured out who was responsible, resulting in a unanimous agreement that, along with most trouble, Loki was to blame.|$|E

500|$|In the past, numismatic {{writers have}} {{described}} the Association and its activities harshly. Bowers states that the Oregon Trail coins [...] "are beautiful, but circumstances surrounding their issuance leave much to be desired". Slabaugh noted that [...] "Artistically, {{this is my favorite}} commemorative coin. [...] But from an ethical standpoint, it is not." [...] Swiatek and Breen wrote that the Association's [...] "activities in exploiting coin collectors and the general public eventually led to the unpopularity of commemoratives in Congress and ultimately to adamant Treasury Department opposition to any further commemorative issues, no matter how worthy the cause to be memorialized, no matter who represented the sponsoring commissions". [...] According to Bowers, [...] "as far as I know, the financial benefits which provided the reason for issuing the half dollars, 'to rescue the various important points along the old trail from oblivion,' to erect 'suitable monuments, memorial and otherwise,' etc., never came to pass, at least not from money provided by the sale of the coins." [...] These, however, did not have the benefit of examining OTMA records. [...] Following the opening of Driggs's papers for research at Southern Utah University, an October 2013 article in The Numismatist concluded that though many documents, such as the arrangements with Scott's, are missing from his records, <b>what</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> [...] "seems consistent with Driggs wanting to use the coins to finance the marking of the Oregon Trail, not to line his own pockets".|$|E
500|$|Kitty Kelly of The Chicago Tribune wrote, [...] "Two more {{attractive}} artists never collaborated {{in a single}} production than this star baby and this star dog. Of them {{it is impossible to}} say which is the more so, though one demonstrates the maximum of naturalness while the other is an exponent of the maximum of training. ... As a general thing, I disapprove of the agonies of film mortality and its frequent projection of cemetery scenes, but {{this is one of the}} situations that must be handed the label 'exception'. ... The picture is a miniature masterpiece." [...] Contained within her review Kelly, also mentioned that baby Helen was placed in front of the camera so that even as she lay [...] "dying" [...] that she was still shown to be breathing. Kelly stated that no person would wish for a person to stop breathing for the sake of the film, but noted that it was not the best point of vision, but noted that the scene was well-managed. In Britain, The Bioscope reviewer agreed with other reviewers in finding the film to be, [...] "...a perfectly delightful little film. Although it is true that its plot, <b>what</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> of it, contains nothing very new, it is not merely a conventional dog and child picture of the ordinary type. It is, rather, an exquisite pictorial fancy, charmingly conceived for the most part and charmingly executed throughout. ... The picture is perfectly done, and not even in the ghost scenes toward the end is there anything banal or insincere in it. A film so full of tender sentiments and natural beauty should meet with the warmest of welcomes everywhere." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{newspaper}} {{also turned}} against Cherie Blair, the former Prime Minister's wife, when the Blairs' lawyers prevented {{the publication of}} a former nanny's memoirs; official regulations prevent press revelations regarding the children of public figures. The Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday also came into direct conflict with No. 10 in 2002 for their pursuit of Cherie Blair's connection to the conman Peter Foster, although Dacre denied any [...] "agenda apart from good journalism". He was reportedly horrified when he saw Cherie Blair breastfeeding in public. Tony Blair targeted the Mail titles directly, denouncing [...] "parts of the media that will take <b>what</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> that is true and then turn it round into something that is a total distortion of the real truth". Motivated by the Daily Express disallowing the Daily Mail to serialise a biography of Alastair Campbell by then Express employee Peter Oborne, the Mails spoiling exercise led to Campbell contacting Dacre because a Mail article had falsely declared Campbell's father to be dead when, in fact, he was still alive. Dacre had previously told Campbell, that he had not supervised that day's issue. A donation followed to the school of one of Campbell's children.|$|E

Tim is a perfectionist, and rightly so. Because his melodies make so much sense of everything, it would be ridiculous to put out these recordings, as exciting as they are, without the melodies. We have talked about people who Tim would approve of adding vocals, under his direction. I think Tim just wants to be well enough to really be producing it. I think his big drive at the moment is to finish off things that were started. There are a lot of loose ends that need tying up.|$|E
2500|$|Yggdrasil is {{mentioned}} in two {{books in the}} Prose Edda; Gylfaginning and Skáldskaparmál. In Gylfaginning, Yggdrasil is introduced in chapter 15. In chapter 15, Gangleri (described as king Gylfi in disguise) asks where is the chief or holiest place of the gods. High replies [...] "It is the ash Yggdrasil. There the gods must hold their courts each day". Gangleri asks <b>what</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> to tell about Yggdrasil. Just-As-High says that Yggdrasil is the biggest {{and best of all}} trees, that its branches extend out over all of the world and reach out over the sky. Three of the roots of the tree support it, and these three roots also extend extremely far: one [...] "is among the Æsir, the second among the frost jötnar, and the third over Niflheim. The root over Niflheim is gnawed at by the wyrm Níðhöggr, and beneath this root is the spring Hvergelmir. Beneath the root that reaches the frost jötnar is the well Mímisbrunnr, [...] "which has wisdom and intelligence contained in it, and the master of the well is called Mimir". Just-As-High provides details regarding Mímisbrunnr and then describes that the third root of the well [...] "extends to heaven" [...] and that beneath the root is the [...] "very holy" [...] well Urðarbrunnr. At Urðarbrunnr the gods hold their court, and every day the Æsir ride to Urðarbrunnr up over the bridge Bifröst. Later in the chapter, a stanza from Grímnismál mentioning Yggdrasil is quoted in support.|$|E
