5|$|In the United States, the 1920s was {{a decade}} of social experimentation, {{particularly}} <b>with</b> <b>sex.</b> This was heavily influenced by the writings of Sigmund Freud, who theorized that sexual desire would be sated unconsciously, despite an individual's wish to ignore it. Freud's theories were much more pervasive in the U.S. than in Europe. With the well-publicized notion that sexual acts {{were a part of}} lesbianism and their relationships, sexual experimentation was widespread. Large cities that provided a nightlife were immensely popular, and women began to seek out sexual adventure. Bisexuality became chic, particularly in America's first gay neighborhoods.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} done to compare risk factors for HIV/STDs in women who {{reported}} having had <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> {{both men and women}} and women who reported having had <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only. METHODS: Female participants in a multisite, randomized HIV/STD prevention study in the Seattle area reported both having had <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> a man in the 3 months before and having at least 1 risk factor for HIV/STDs during the year before the study. Of these women, 38 % who reported ever having had <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> a woman were compared with those who reported having had <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only. RESULTS: Women who had had <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> both men and women were more likely than women who had had <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only to report drug use in the 3 months before the study, a greater lifetime number of male partners, a sex partner who had had <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> a prostitute, an earlier age at sexual debut, and forced sexual contact (P <. 01 for all comparisons). Women who had had <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> both men and women had a mean of 3. 2 of these 5 risk factors, vs 2. 1 among women who had had <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only (P <. 001). CONCLUSION: Women who had had <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> both men and women were more likely than women who had had <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only to engage in multiple risk behaviors. Health workers should be aware of bisexual experience among women, since this may be a marker for multiple risk behaviors for HIV/STDs...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{estimate}} {{the number of}} men who have <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> {{men and women who are}} HIV-positive in the United States, and to compare HIV prevalence rates between men who have <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men and women, men who have <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only, and men who have <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> women exclusively. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of reports referencing HIV prevalence and men who have <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men and women. We searched PubMed and Ovid PsycINFO for peer-reviewed, U. S. -based articles reporting on HIV prevalence among men who have <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men and women. We conducted event rate, effect size, moderation and sensitivity analyses. Results: We estimate that 1. 0 % of U. S. males are bisexually-behaving, and that 121, 800 bisexually-behaving men are HIV-positive. Men who have <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men and women are less than half as likely to be HIV-positive as men who have <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only (16. 9 % vs. 33. 3 %; OR = 0. 41, 95 % CI: 0. 31, 0. 54), but more than five times as likely to be HIV-positive as men who have <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> women exclusively (18. 3 % vs. 3. 5 %; OR = 5. 71, 95 % CI: 3. 47, 9. 39). They are less likely to engage in unprotected receptive anal intercourse than men who have <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only (15. 9 % vs. 35. 0 %; OR = 0. 36, 95 % CI: 0. 28, 0. 46). Men who have <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men and women in samples with high racial/ethnic minority proportions had significantly higher HIV prevalence than their counterparts in low racial/ethnic minority samples. Conclusions: This represents the first meta-analysis of HIV prevalence in the U. S. between men who have <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men and women and men who have <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men only. Data collection, research, and HIV prevention and care delivery specifically tailored to men who have <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> men and women are necessary to better quantify and ameliorate this population's HIV burden. © 2014 Friedman et al...|$|R

25|$|Erotic {{fiction is}} the name given to fiction that deals <b>with</b> <b>sex</b> or sexual themes, {{generally}} in a more literary or serious way than the fiction seen in pornographic magazines and sometimes including elements of satire or social criticism.

It should be noted, however, that apparently non-fictional works dealing <b>with</b> <b>sex</b> or sexual themes may contain fictional elements; calling an erotic book 'a memoir' is a literary device that is common in this genre. For reasons {{similar to those that}} make pseudonyms both commonplace and often deviously set up, the boundary between fiction and non-fiction is often very diffuse.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{risk of the}} HIV {{epidemic}} spreading from {{high-risk groups}} {{to the general population}} in Vietnam depends on sexual risk and bridging behaviors between highand low-risk individuals. A cross-sectional study was used to describe sexual activities of youth aged 18 – 29 years. Nearly half (41. 4 %) were sexually active. Premarital sex was reported by 43. 3 % of them; 78. 3 % of sexually active males and 13. 5 % of sexually active females. Multiple sex partners were reported by 31. 0 %; 56. 7 % of males and 9. 2 % of females. Almost 27 % of males and 5 % of females engaged in sexual bridging behaviors. Being unmarried was significantly associated <b>with</b> having <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> non-regular partners. Being unmarried and early age at first intercourse were associated <b>with</b> having <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> a <b>sex</b> worker. Consistent condom use was high <b>with</b> commercial <b>sex</b> workers but low with regular partners. Education to delay early sexual debut, increased employment, and strategies to inform young sexually active people to adopt safer behaviors are urgently needed...|$|R

Objective: This study aims {{to explore}} the {{association}} between using smartphone dating applications (apps) and having unprotected <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> a casual <b>sex</b> partner. Study design: This is a cross-sectional study. Students were recruited from four university campuses in Hong Kong by convenience sampling. Main outcome measures: Subjects completed a structured questionnaire asking {{about the use of}} dating apps, sexual history and socio-demographic information. Multiple logistic regressions were used {{to explore the}} association between using dating apps and having unprotected <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> a casual <b>sex</b> partner. Results: Six hundred and sixty-six subjects were included in the analysis. Users of dating apps {{were more likely to have}} had unprotected <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> a casual <b>sex</b> partner the last time they engaged in sexual intercourse (aOR: 10. 06). Using dating apps for more than 12 months was associated with having a casual sex partner in the last sexual intercourse (aOR: 3. 21), as well as having unprotected <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> that casual partner (aOR: 13. 56). Conclusion: We found a robust association between using dating apps and having unprotected <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> a casual <b>sex</b> partner, implying that using dating apps is an emerging sexual risk factor.
