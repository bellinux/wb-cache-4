5|$|Ministers in the Madras {{government}} and ruling party members supported the strike. On 29 August 1921, the police opened fire and killed {{six of the}} <b>workers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spot. Top Justice Party leaders like O. Thanikachalam Chetti severely censured the police for the measures they adopted.

Another probable reason was that the striking workers had the caste sympathies of the Justice Party government whose ministers and chief whips were caste Hindus like themselves.|$|E
5|$|Of the 240 {{people killed}} during the storm, 135 were <b>workers</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Florida East Coast Railway.

As a result, several lawsuits were filed, although they were denied after the path of this storm was revealed to have been similar to the 1906 hurricane.|$|E
