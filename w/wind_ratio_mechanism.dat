However, there have only been a very limited number of studies on the effects of residential area building layout on the winter wind environments, which led to a lack of quantitative guidance for residential area planning in severely cold regions. This study aims to reveal the relationship between (1) the residential areas' building density, floor area <b>ratio,</b> <b>wind</b> projection angle, average building height, and relative position of high-rise buildings, and; (2) the mean <b>wind</b> velocity <b>ratio</b> at pedestrian level in severe cold regions.

40|$|The {{abundance}} of 3 He {{in the present}} day local interstellar cloud (LIC) and in the sun {{has important implications for}} the study of galactic evolution and for estimating the production of light nuclei in the early universe. Data from the Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer (SWICS) on Ulysses is used to measure the isotopic ratio of helium (3 He/ 4 He = Γ) both in the solar wind and the local interstellar cloud. For the solar wind, the unique high-latitude orbit of Ulysses allows us to study this ratio in the slow and highly dynamic wind in the ecliptic plane as well as the steady high-latitude wind of the polar coronal holes. The 3 He+/ 4 He+ ratio in the local cloud is derived from the isotopic ratio of pickup helium measured in the high-speed solar wind. In the LIC the ratio is found to be (2. 48 - 0. 62 + 0. 68) × 10 - 4 with the 1 -σ uncertainty resulting almost entirely from statistical error.

40|$|In a {{high-speed}} {{signal transmission system}} that uses transformer coupling, {{there is a need}} to provide increased transmitted signal strength without adding active components. This invention uses additional transformers to achieve the needed gain. The prior art uses stronger drivers (which require an IC redesign and a higher power supply voltage), or the addition of another active component (which can decrease reliability, increase power consumption, reduce the beneficial effect of serializer/deserializer preemphasis or deemphasis, and/or interfere with fault containment mechanisms), or uses a different transformer <b>winding</b> <b>ratio</b> (which requires redesign of the transformer and may not be feasible with high-speed signals that require a 1 : 1 <b>winding</b> <b>ratio).</b> This invention achieves the required gain by connecting the secondaries of multiple transformers in series. The primaries of these transformers are currently either connected in parallel or are connected to multiple drivers. There is also a need to split a receive signal to multiple destinations with minimal signal loss. Additional transformers can achieve the split. The prior art uses impedance-matching series resistors that cause a loss of signal. Instead of causing a loss, most instantiations of this invention would actually provide gain. Multiple transformers are used instead of multiple windings on a single transformer because multiple windings on the same transformer would require a redesign of the transformer, and may not be feasible with high-speed transformers that usually require a bifilar winding with a 1 : 1 ratio. This invention creates the split by connecting the primaries of multiple transformers in series. The secondary of each transformer is connected to one of the intended destinations without the use of impedance-matching series resistors...|$|R

The control algorithm proposed by Huang et al. (Phys. Rev. A 74, 053408 (2006)) is used to obtain an analytic expression for the control field.

However, in the case when the field frequency is tuned close to a two-photon resonance the local barriers are not effective in suppressing the dissociation. We establish that in the on-resonant case quantum dissociation primarily occurs via resonance-assisted tunneling and controlling the quantum dynamics requires a local perturbation of the specific nonlinear resonance in the underlying phase space.

40|$|D. Ing. The {{technique}} {{of using a}} live power cable to simultaneously transport a communication signal, has been practiced since the early 1900 ’s. In most cases, power-line communications has been implemented as a retrofit technology, with its main benefit being the utilization of a ‘free’ existing network. This driving force of power-line communications is typical for high-, medium-, and low-voltage distribution networks, as well as intra-building networks currently targeted for home automation and home networking. Researchers have thus focused on the optimum use of these existing power-line channels, often accepting the inherent drawbacks of this hostile communication channel. Apart from unpredictable noise sources, two main disadvantages of the low-voltage powerline network as a communication channel, are i) the unknown power cable characteristics and topology and ii) time-dependent fluctuation of the power-line impedance level as loads are unpredictable switched into, {{and out of the}} network. These two factors have obscured the requirements for proper coupling and impedance adaptation to the degree that most researchers and manufacturers have merely accepted this typical ≈ 20 -dB coupling loss as one of the inherited disadvantages of the power-line channel. Most researchers and manufacturers have thus defaulted to a guessed power-line impedance level, and have used one fixed coupler <b>winding</b> <b>ratio</b> under all circumstances, regardless of power-line conditions. This study has shown that proper coupling and impedance adaptation can yield significant transmission gains even with limited (qualitative) knowledge of a power-line channel and its topology. After formulating design steps for an impedance-adapting coupler that facilitates bidirectional transmission, the impact of the fluctuating power-line impedance on coupler bandwidth was investigated. Next, impedance adaptation strategies were considered and the tradeoff between series cable requirements and parallel load requirements was explored. A model of sufficient simplicity was developed to facilitate qualitative description and classification of power outlets – functioning as communication nodes. Very interesting simulation results were obtained and these were verified using a laboratory setup of characterized power cables and calibrated loads. Next, these simulation results were employed to improve power-line transmission over a live, uncharacterized 220 -V residential network by means of i) classifying typical residential rooms qualitatively in order to choose proper coupler <b>winding</b> <b>ratios</b> and ii) using an innovative dual coupler for dedicated on-off switching with harsh loads, thereby mitigating the fluctuating impact of said loads on low-voltage power-line communications...|$|R
