5|$|Abandoning {{their usual}} {{strategy}} {{of trying to}} make major inroads in Liberal-dominated Quebec, the Tories focused on winning seats in the other provinces. They were successful; though they gained few seats in Quebec, they won 112seats overall to the Liberals' 105. With the remaining seats won by other parties, the PC party only had a plurality in the House of Commons, but the margin <b>was</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>to</b> make John Diefenbaker Canada's first Tory Prime Minister since 1935.|$|E

5|$|Because the liquid-to-gas {{expansion}} ratio of nitrogen is 1:694 at 20°C, {{a tremendous amount}} of force can be generated if liquid nitrogen is rapidly vaporised in an enclosed space. In an incident on January 12, 2006 at Texas A University, the pressure-relief devices of a tank of liquid nitrogen were malfunctioning and later sealed. As a result of the subsequent pressure buildup, the tank failed catastrophically. The force of the explosion <b>was</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>to</b> propel the tank through the ceiling immediately above it, shatter a reinforced concrete beam immediately below it, and blow the walls of the laboratory 0.1–0.2m off their foundations.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, Marquis {{enrolled}} at University Medical College, Kansas City. A year of study <b>was</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>to</b> {{allow him to}} practice medicine {{under the supervision of}} his father at Bosworth, Missouri, where the pair set up a practice and opened a drugstore. The practice was not very successful, so Marquis and his wife moved to Coloma where he worked under the supervision of another doctor. Marquis completed his studies with financial help from his wife's family and summer work as a printer in Anaconda. He graduated March23, 1898, and returned to Montana. His daughter, Minnie-Ellen, was born soon after in Anaconda.|$|E
5|$|In 1971 a Boeing 747, {{operating}} as Pan Am 845 struck approach light structures for the reciprocal runway as it lifted off the runway at San Francisco Airport. Major {{damage to the}} belly and landing gear resulted, which caused the loss of hydraulic fluid from three of its four flight control systems.

On 25 March 1859 Richmond Bridge became toll-free. A large procession made its way to the bridge, where a team of labourers symbolically removed toll gates from their hinges. The toll houses were demolished, replaced by seating in 1868; investment income from the revenue accumulated during the 83years the tolls had been charged <b>was</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>to</b> pay for the bridge's maintenance.|$|E

The latter gave concerts in various towns and cities and raised money for church restoration. He wrote some madrigals himself, which were published by Novello, a company with which he was to do much future business. He also wrote an oratorio, Gideon, as the exercise for his doctorate and it was performed in November 1865.

ORNL scientific computing chief Jeff Nichols noted that Titan cost approximately $60 million upfront, of which the NOAA contribution was less than $10 million, but precise figures were covered by non-disclosure agreements. The full term of the contract with Cray included $97 million, excluding potential upgrades.|$|E

The ACB concluded that, since Waugh and Warne had previously accused Pakistani cricket captain Saleem Malik of attempting to bribe them to lose matches, their credibility as witnesses would be damaged if their own involvement with John was publicised. The ACB reported the matter to the International Cricket Council, and there the matter ended.|$|E
5|$|Although Captain Edward Edwards {{discovered}} the atoll in 1791, Ducie {{was not considered}} a British possession. In 1867 Ducie was claimed by the United States under the Guano Islands Act, which established that an uninhabited territory with guano deposits could be claimed as a US possession, {{so long as it}} was unclaimed by any other country. Despite claims on several other territories, based on various documents such as the Guano Islands Act, neither the United States nor the United Kingdom recognised the sovereignty claimed by each other. Neither of the two considered that the mere discovery of an island <b>was</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>to</b> claim sovereignty over it, and often a formal act of possession was considered the proper procedure to claim rights over a territory. Ultimately, the United States did not assert its sovereignty over most of its claimed territories.|$|E

Both ships had suffered heavy damage and {{casualties in the}} unequal engagement and could not hope to continue their resistance {{with the rest of}} the British squadron rapidly approaching. To the north, Infatigable had failed to outrun Mars and Captain Lukin forced the frigate to surrender after a brief cannonade. With three ships lost and the other three long disappeared to the south, Soleil determined to flee westwards, hoping the damage he had inflicted on Centaurs sails <b>was</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>to</b> prevent her pursuit. However, Gloire had also been damaged and could not distance herself from the British flagship sufficiently before support arrived in the form of Mars. With his ship undamaged, Lukin was able to easily catch the fleeing frigate and opened fire at 14:30, combat continuing for half an hour before Soleil surrendered, his frigate badly damaged. To the south, Windsor Castle had proven far too slow to catch the smaller French ships, which had easily outrun the second rate and escaped.|$|E

Hardstaff had scored a duck and 43 in the First Test, while Barnett managed only eight and six.

Bradman was not convinced of Lindwall's fitness, but the bowler's protestations <b>was</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>to</b> convince his captain to gamble on his inclusion.
