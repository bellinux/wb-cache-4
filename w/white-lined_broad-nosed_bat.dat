50|$|The <b>white-lined</b> <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bat,</b> Platyrrhinus lineatus, is a bat {{species from}} South America. It {{is found in}} {{southern}} and eastern Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, northern Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, French Guyana and Suriname.|$|E
50|$|This {{species was}} first {{encountered}} in 1984 in Colombia. Its species name chocoensis {{is derived from}} the region where it was found, the Chocó Department. A morphological study suggested that it may be the most basal (earliest offshoot) of its genus, however, another study using DNA suggested that the Platyrrhinus of the Chocó region diverged from Platyrrhinus of the Amazonian Craton, and that the <b>white-lined</b> <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bat</b> was more basal.|$|E
5000|$|The little <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bat</b> (Scotorepens greyii) is {{a species}} of vesper bat. It is found only in Australia, where it is {{widespread}} over the northern Western Australia, the Northern Territory and most of Queensland and New South Wales.Little <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> roost together in colonies of 2-20 bats. They roost in hollows in old,unused buildings and inside hollow fence posts. They have even been found roosting underneath the metal caps on top of telegraph posts.Little <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> feed on flying insects, such as mosquitoes. They hunt for insects by flying {{along the edges of}} creeks and over waterholes, catching their prey in flight. They drink by skimming over the surface of the water.In southern Australia little <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> mate before winter, with the females giving birth to twins in summer.Like many <b>bats</b> little <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> are vulnerable to loss of roost sites and feeding grounds by forestry activities, and when land is cleared for agriculture and housing.Like most native Australian animals, little <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> are protected.|$|R

50|$|The inland <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bat</b> (Scotorepens balstoni), {{also known}} as the western <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bat,</b> is a species of vesper bat. It is endemic to Australia and is {{widespread}} throughout the inland, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. This insectivorous microbat, measuring 12 cm in length, roosts in tree hollows during the day and forages over woodland and water at night.|$|R
50|$|Heller's <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bat,</b> Platyrrhinus helleri, is a bat {{species from}} South and Central America.|$|R
50|$|Rüppell's <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bat</b> (Scoteanax rueppellii) is {{a species}} of vesper bat found in Australia.|$|R
50|$|The inland <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bat</b> is a moderate-sized {{species of}} microbat. It {{features}} a characteristic broad square-shaped muzzle {{when viewed from}} above that is formed by swollen, glandular pads (Reardon & Flavel 1991, p. 72). The fur colour of the species can vary from dark brown to a pale sand colour, with light grey-brown {{on the back and}} pale brown on the belly being most common (Churchill 2008, p. 155). This species along with other <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> have short slender ears, small eyes, a tail enclosed in the uropatagium membrane and only one upper incisor on each side (Parnaby 1999). Unique to male inland <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> are the numerous spines on the glans penis, with up to 22 spines on the head in two long rows (Churchill 2008, p. 155). Body measurements, especially forearm length, along with distribution are useful in identifying the species (Churchill 2008 p. 110). The species can also be identified by its short tragus of 4 mm (Parnaby 2008, p. 553). Male inland <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> tend to be slightly smaller than females (Reardon & Flavel 1991, p. 72).|$|R

50|$|Inland <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> are {{distributed}} widely throughout inland Australia, including arid and semi-arid regions. They {{are generally not}} distributed east of the Great Dividing Range (Churchill 2008, p. 155).|$|R

5000|$|Previously {{considered}} [...] "Vulnerable", the Recife <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bat</b> was re-classified as of [...] "Least Concern" [...] by the IUCN in 2008. However, it {{is considered}} an endangered species in Brazil, where it is threatened with habitat loss. It has no recognised subspecies.|$|R
50|$|Also on {{the list}} {{contained}} in the act are seven mammals. They are the; brushed tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicullata), yellow-bellied glider (Petaurus australis), spotted-tailed quoll (Dasyurus maculates), long-nosed potoroo (Potoous trudactylus), eastern bent-wing bat (Miniopterus schreidersii), smoky mouse (Pseudomys fumeus), greater <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bat</b> (Scoteanax rueppellii).|$|R
50|$|The Recife <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bat</b> is {{of average}} size for its subfamily, {{with a total}} body length of 58 to 93 mm, and a weight of 14 to 19 g. Individuals from the {{northern}} part of the range are generally somewhat smaller than those from the south.|$|R
50|$|Mammals {{reported}} in the sanctuary include: the montane guinea pig, the mountain tapir, the spectacled bear, the puma, the white-tailed deer, the grey-bellied shrew opossum, Taczanowski's Oldfield mouse, the hairy yellow-shouldered <b>bat,</b> Thomas's <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bat,</b> the Venezuelan red howler, the lowland paca, the nine-banded armadillo, etc.|$|R
50|$|Foraging {{locations}} in the drier distribution areas appear to depend on nearness to water points and roosting sites (Williams & Dickman 2004, p. 213). In arid areas inland <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> possibly obtain water from the insects eaten and further conserve water by producing concentrated urine in specialized kidneys (Williams & Dickman 2004, p. 205). In semi-arid areas foraging is concentrated around water sources with drinking occurring during flight (Reardon & Flavel 1991, p. 72). Similar to other arid zone mammals it is likely, especially in southern distribution areas, that the inland <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bat</b> is able to enter into prolonged periods of torpor, reducing energy and water requirements (Geiser 2004, p. 130). Another arid and semi-arid adaption {{is the ability to}} tolerate high body temperatures (Bondarenco, Körtner & Geiser 2014, p. 684).|$|R
50|$|<b>Broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> {{breed in}} the rainy season, giving birth between June and July in the {{northern}} parts of their range, {{and later in the}} year further south. They give birth to a single hairless young, weighing about 3 g, which first opens its eyes within a few hours of birth.|$|R
50|$|One {{group of}} birds that is present {{all year round}} are the parrots. Many breed in the Parklands' trees are found, such as rainbow lorikeets, rosellas, red-rumped parrots, galahs and cockatoos. Threatened species in the park include, Meridolum corneovirens, Grey-headed flying fox, little eagle, Eastern false pipistrelle, Varied sittella, East-coast free-tailed bat, Common bent-wing <b>bat,</b> Rüppell's <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bat</b> and Turquoise parrot.|$|R
5000|$|The Choco <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bat</b> (Platyrrhinus chocoensis) is {{a species}} of bat in the family Phyllostomidae. It is native to Colombia, Panama, and Ecuador, where it {{is found in the}} Choco region lowlands. [...] It is {{threatened}} by habitat loss. In 2013, Bat Conservation International listed this species as one of the 35 species of its worldwide priority list of conservation.|$|R
50|$|Research {{evidence}} indicates that Scotorepens balstoni may be a ‘composite of several distinct species’ creating {{the need for a}} ‘comprehensive taxonomic assessment’ of the species (Parnaby 2008, p. 552). Due to similarities in appearance Scotorepens balstoni is most likely {{to be confused with the}} other species of small <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> (Scotorepens): S. greyii, S. orion, S. sanborni and S. sp. (Parnaby 1999, p. 4; Richards & Hall 2012, p. 169).|$|R
50|$|Inland <b>broad-nosed</b> <b>bats</b> {{prefer to}} roost in tree hollows, {{in groups of}} up to 45 {{individuals}} (Churchill 2008, p. 155). Roosting also occurs in the roofs of buildings, under metal caps of power poles and in water pipes (Churchill 2008, p. 155). They often roost horizontally (Parnaby 2008, p. 552). The species {{has been known to}} share roosts with colonies of south-eastern freetail bats (Mormopterus sp.) (Australian Museum 2009; Churchill 2008, p. 155).|$|R
50|$|Many microbat and megabat species {{inhabit the}} park, {{several of these}} species are threatened.
