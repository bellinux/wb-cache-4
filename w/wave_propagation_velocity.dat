50|$|The last {{technique}} {{can be used}} {{to measure}} the seismic anisotropy is related to the sonic logging information of a deviated well. In a deviated well, the <b>wave</b> <b>propagation</b> <b>velocity</b> is higher than the <b>wave</b> <b>propagation</b> <b>velocity</b> in a vertical well at the same depth. This difference in velocity between deviated well and vertical well reflects the anisotropy parameters of the rocks near the borehole.

5000|$|Conventional FTCD has {{limitations}} {{for the study}} of cerebral lateralization. For example, it may not differentiate the lateralising effects due to stimulus characteristics from those due to light responsiveness, and does not distinguish between flow signals emanating from cortical and subcortical branches of the cerebral arteries of the circle of Willis. Each basal cerebral artery of the circle of Willis gives origin to two different systems of secondary vessels. The shorter of these two is called the ganglionic system, and the vessels belonging to it supply the thalami and corpora striata; the longer is the cortical system, and its vessels ramify in the pia mater and supply the cortex and subjacent brain substance. Furthermore, the cortical branches are divisible into two classes: long and short. The long or medullary arteries pass through the grey substance and penetrate the subjacent white substance to the depth of 3-4 cm. The short vessels are confined to the cortex. Both cortical and ganglionic systems do not communicate at any point in their peripheral distribution, but are entirely independent of each other, having between the parts supplied by the two systems, a borderline of diminished nutritive activity. While, the vessels of the ganglionic system are terminal vessels, the vessels of the cortical arterial system are not so strictly [...] "terminal". Blood flow in these two systems in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory supplies 80% of both hemispheres, including most neural substrates implicated in facial processing, language processing and intelligence processing at cortical and subcortical structures. The measurements of mean blood flow velocity (MFV) in the MCA main stem could potentially provide information about downstream changes at cortical and subcortical sites within the MCA territory. Each distal arm of the MCA vascular system could be separated into [...] "near" [...] and [...] "far" [...] distal reflection sites for the cortical and ganglionic (subcortical) systems, respectively. To accomplish this objective, one method is to apply Fourier analysis to the periodic time series of MFV acquired during cognitive stimulations. Fourier analysis would yield peaksrepresenting pulsatile energy from reflection sites at various harmonics, which are multiples of the fundamental frequency. McDonald in 1974 showed that the first five harmonics usually contain 90% of the entire pulsatile energy within the system of pressure/flow oscillations in the peripheral circulation. It could be presumed that each arm of the vascular system represents a single viscoelastic tube terminated by impedance, creating a single reflection site. Psychophysiologic stimulation induced vasomotor activity at each terminal site sets up a standing sinusoidal wave oscillation, comprising a summation of waves due to effects of incident, reflected, and re-reflected waves from distal to proximal point of measurement. fTCDS studies are performed with the participant placed in a supine posture with their head up at about 30 degrees. The probe holder headgear (e.g. LAM-RAK, DWL, Sipplingen, Germany) are used with a base support on two earplugs and on the nasal ridge. Two 2-MHz probes are affixed in the probe holder and insonation performed to determine the optimal position for continuous monitoring of both MCA main stems at 50 mm depth {{from the surface of the}} probe. A serial recording of MFV for each stimulus is acquired and latter used for Fourier analysis. Fourier transform algorithm uses standard software (for example, Time series and forecasting module, STATISTICA, StatSoft, Inc.). The most efficient standard Fourier algorithm requires that the length of the input series is equal to a power of 2. If this is not the case, additional computations have to be performed. To derive the required time series, the data were averaged in 10-second segments for 1-minute duration or each stimulus, yielding 6 data points for each participant and a total of 48 data points for all eight men and women, respectively. Smoothing the periodogram values was accomplished using a weighted moving average transformation. Hamming window was applied as a smoother. The spectral density estimates, derived from single series Fourier analysis, were plotted, and the frequency regions with the highest estimates were marked as peaks. The origins of the peaks are of interest in order to determine the reliability of the present technique. The fundamental (F), cortical (C) or memory (M), and subcortical (S) peaks occurred at regular frequency intervals of 0.125, 0.25, and 0.375, respectively. These frequencies could be converted to Hz, assuming that the fundamental frequency of cardiac oscillation was the mean heart rate. The fundamental frequency (F) of the first harmonic could be determined from the mean heart rate per second. For example, a heart rate of 74 bpm, suggests 74 cycles/60 or 1.23 Hz. In other words, the F-, C-, and S-peaks occurred at multiples of the first harmonic, at second and third harmonics, respectively. The distance of the reflection site for F-peak could be presumed to emanate from a site at D1 = wavelength/4 = cf/4 = 6.15 (m/s)/(4×1.23 Hz) = 125 cm, where c is the assumed <b>wave</b> <b>propagation</b> <b>velocity</b> of the peripheral arterial tree according to McDonald, 1974.Given the vascular tortuosity, the estimated distance approximates that from the measurement site in the MCA main stem, to an imaginary site of summed reflections from the upper extremities, close to the finger tips when stretchedsideways. The C-peak occurred at the secondharmonic, such that the estimated arterial length (using common carotidc = 5.5 m/s) was given by D2 = wavelength/8 = cf2/8 = 28 cm, and a frequency f of 2.46 Hz. The distance approximates the visible arterial length from the main stem of the MCA, through vascular tortuosity and around the cerebral convexity, to the end vessels at distal cortical sites such as the occipito-temporal junction oncarotid angiograms of adults. The S-peak occurred at the third harmonic, and may have arisen from an estimated site at D3= wavelength/16 = cf3/16 = 9.3 cm and a frequency f3 of 3.69 Hz. The latter approximates the visible arterial length of the lenticulostriate vessels from the main stem of the MCA on carotid angiograms. Although not displayed, the fourth harmonic would be expected to arise from the MCA bifurcation in closest proximity tothe measurement site in the main stem of the MCA. The pre-bifurcationlength from the measurement point would be given by D4 = wavelength/32 = cf4/32 = 3.5 cm and a frequency f4 of 4.92 Hz. The calculated distance approximates that of the segment of MCA main stem just after the carotid bifurcation, where probably the ultrasound sample volume was placed, to the MCA bifurcation. Thus, these estimates approximate actual lengths. However, it has been suggested that the estimated distances may not correlate exactly with known morphometric dimensions of the arterial tree according to Campbell et al., 1989. The method was first described by Philip Njemanze in 2007, and was referred to as functional transcranial Doppler spectroscopy (fTCDS). fTCDS examines spectral density estimates of periodic processes induced during mental tasks, and hence offers a much more comprehensive picture of changes related to effects of a given mental stimulus. The spectral density estimates would be least affected by artefacts that lack periodicity, and filtering would reduce the effect of noise. The changes at the C-peak may show cortical long-term potential (CLTP) or cortical long-term depression (CLTD), which has been proposed to be suggest equivalents of cortical activity during learning [...] and cognitive processes. The flow velocity tracings are monitored during paradigm 1 comprising a checkerboard square as object perception are compared to whole face (paradigm 2) and facial element sorting task (paradigm 3). Fast Fourier transform calculations are used to obtain the spectral density and cross amplitude plots in the left and right middle cerebral arteries. The C-peak also called memory (M-peak) cortical peak could be seen arising during paradigm 3, a facial element sorting task requiring iterative memory recall as a subject constantly spatially fits the puzzle by matching each facial element in paradigm 3 to that stored in memory (Paradigm 2) before proceeding to form the picture of the whole face.|$|E

30|$|In this article, {{we report}} on an {{estimation}} method for Young’s modulus that entails measuring only the stress <b>wave</b> <b>propagation</b> <b>velocity</b> of timber built into structures such as wooden buildings. Methods of estimating Young’s modulus that use the stress <b>wave</b> <b>propagation</b> <b>velocity</b> and characteristic frequency of timber in conjunction with timber density have long been used.

40|$|The {{changes in}} {{physical}} properties of sandstones with burial depth {{are a result}} of mechanical and chemical compaction processes.

Data from 30 wells have been used to investigate and compare the changes in porosity, bulk density, elastic moduli and <b>wave</b> <b>propagation</b> <b>velocities</b> between the mid-Jurassic sandstones of the Etive Fm. in the North Sea and the Garn Fm. in the Norwegian Sea. At shallow burial depths (less than 2 km) the changes of the physical properties are governed by effective stress. A mechanical compaction model is used to describe the porosity loss and the bulk density increase with depth, whereas the friable-sand theory is used to explain the changes in elastic moduli and <b>wave</b> <b>propagation</b> <b>velocities.</b> For both formations, the under predictions by the models in the porosity, bulk moduli and P-wave velocity values from the data suggest high depositional porosities (0. 40) and small amounts of quartz cement at depths of 1. 6 - 2. 0 km. At greater burial depths and temperatures (greater than 2 km, and greater than 75 °C) quartz cementation is the main controlling factor in the changes of the physical properties. The porosity loss and the bulk density increase with depth are explained by means of a quartz cement precipitation model, and the contact-cement theory is used to describe the changes in elastic moduli and <b>wave</b> <b>propagation</b> <b>velocities.</b> High porosities (greater than 0. 15) at great burial depths (greater than 4 km) suggest the presence of higher amounts of clay coatings in both formations, and they may also be a result of high overpressures.
