5|$|Before her stasis {{aboard the}} Spear of Adun, Rohana was a driven protoss {{who was not}} afraid to seek out tasks others thought impossible. She {{displayed}} strict adherence to tradition, yet was creative {{when faced with the}} issues. After she was awakened, Rohana held on to the old ways of the Protoss Empire, openly speaking out against her Nerazim crew, Artanis' Terran allies, and the reawakening of the Purifiers. She served as a reminder of the past, clinging to old traditions and ways, and refusing to cut her connection from the Khala even as Amon continued to possess her, stating knowledge and history <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> brought unity to the protoss. Though Artanis valued her memories and her ability to see into Amon's thoughts, he began to grow weary of her adherence to the old ways and her objections to his choices, becoming more of a critic than a councilor. Eventually, she came to terms with the Daelaam, and cut herself from the Khala, stating that perhaps history {{did not need to be}} recorded with perfect clarity.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Mary Dennett focused {{her efforts}} on the peace movement, but she {{returned}} to the birth control movement in 1918. She continued to lead the NBCL, and collaborated with Sanger's NYWPC. In 1919, Dennett published a widely distributed educational pamphlet, The Sex Side of Life, which treated sex as a natural and enjoyable act. However, in the same year, frustrated with the NBCL's chronic lack of funding, Dennett broke away and formed the Voluntary Parenthood League (VPL). Both Dennett and Sanger proposed legislative changes that would legalize birth control, but they took different approaches: Sanger endorsed contraception but only under a physician's supervision; Dennett pushed for unrestricted access to contraception.Engelman, pp. 113–115. Sanger, a proponent of diaphragms, was concerned that unrestricted access would result in ill-fitting diaphragms and would lead to medical quackery.McCann (1994), pp. 71–72 gives examples that show Sanger's fears were justified. Dennett was concerned that requiring women to get prescriptions from physicians would prevent poor women from receiving contraception, and she was concerned about a shortage of physicians trained in birth control. Both legislative initiatives failed, partly because some legislators felt that fear of pregnancy <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> kept women chaste. In the early 1920s, Sanger's leadership position in the movement solidified because she gave frequent public lectures, and because she took steps to exclude Dennett from meetings and events.|$|E

Then, when his nanny, Oriana, gave him the first record of Franco Corelli, Bocelli began to show {{interest}} in pursuing the career of a tenor. By seven, {{he was able to}} recognize the famous voices of the time and tried to emulate the great interpreters.|$|E

Using the scarab's powers, Jaime was able to reveal the satellite to Batman's group, enabling them to defeat it. Once Brother Eye was sent plummeting Earthward, Jaime disappeared from the ship, teleported away by the scarab, which sought to escape the Green Lanterns on board.|$|E
25|$|While {{scouting}} sixteen {{miles from}} Camp Wright on the Selvies River, near present-day Burns, Captain Loren L. Williams and {{a party of}} twenty Oregon infantrymen from Company H were ambushed by a band of hostile Indians. Williams and his troops fought a harrowing retreat back to Camp Wright, defending themselves for about fifteen hours before they reached safety. All along the way Indians fired from concealed positions. At one point, they even set a brush fire in the soldiers path {{to prevent them from}} escaping. Despite their continuous attacks, the Indians only wounded two soldiers. In his report, Williams stated that his long-range rifles killed fifteen Indians. He also stated that his superior weaponry <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> prevented his party from being overrun.|$|E

He was born with achondroplasia, a common form of dwarfism. Dinklage grew up as the only dwarf in his family in Brookside, New Jersey, with his parents and older brother, Jonathan. He is of German and Irish descent. As a child, Dinklage and his brother performed puppet musicals for people in their neighborhood. Dinklage has described his brother, who is a violinist, as being the [...] "real performer of the family", saying that his brother's passion for the violin <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> kept him from pursuing acting.|$|E
500|$|With John Winchester {{making a}} demonic pact {{in the second}} season première, it was decided early on that the season would also end with another demonic pact. This {{required}} the writers to kill Sam—they felt it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> could motivate Dean to sell his soul—with the pact {{becoming one of the}} driving forces behind the third season. At the same time, it opened up another new storyline by questioning if what returned was [...] "one hundred percent pure Sam". Additionally, the [...] "war of demons against humanity"—hinted at throughout the first two seasons—finally started with the release of demons through the Devil's Gate {{at the end of the}} second episode. This plotline continues throughout the rest of the series, with the Winchesters attempting to hunt down the demons in the third season.|$|E
500|$|Nixon {{celebrated the}} anniversary of the speech each year. The future {{president}} disliked the fact that the address soon became popularly known as the [...] "Checkers speech."

[...] Nixon preferred to call the address [...] "the Fund speech," [...] and made it required reading for his speechwriters. As time passed, the Checkers speech became denigrated, and Nixon biographer Earl Mazo suggested that much of the attitude of [...] "I don't like Nixon, but I don't know why," [...] which contributed to the failure of his 1960 presidential run, {{can be traced to the}} Checkers speech. Other commentators suggested that had he not made the Checkers speech, Nixon might have won in 1960. Nixon retorted that without the Checkers speech, he would not have been around to run in 1960.|$|E

500|$|... "Hair" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Gaga and RedOne, {{and the name}} of the song was revealed through an interview with Vogue magazine in February 2011. On The Graham Norton Show, Gaga explained the origin of the song, which involves the analogy of her hair with freedom, and how that is the only part of her body she can change without anyone judging her. According to a press listening in February, [...] "Hair" [...] draws inspiration from Pat Benatar's '80s classic [...] "We Belong", while thematically focusing on empowering lyrics similar to those of [...] "Born This Way". Gaga elaborated on the song's inspiration further with a video posted on her Twitter account: [...] "When I was a kid, I used to always come down the stairs of my parents' house, and they would say, 'Go back upstairs and brush your hair, change your clothes, you can't go out wearing that', and I felt like it was stifling my identity...

Although the bill did not pass the Senate, White and the NAACP secured widespread {{public support for the}} cause. By 1938, a Gallup poll found that 72% of Americans and 57% of Southerners favored an anti-lynching bill. White also contributed to creating alliances among civil rights activists, many of whom went on to lead in the movement from the 1950s.|$|E

On 13 December they sighted land on the north-west coast of the South Island, New Zealand, becoming the first Europeans to do so.

[...] "The examination [...] does not uncover anything useful (i.e., anything that tempts us to alter the meaning we deduce from the text anyway), but that is the usual consequence of these inquiries (and a good thing, too)." [...] Ultimately, though, Justice Scalia found the effort futile. [...] "I can discern no reason for devoting 10 pages of today's opinion to legislative history, except to show that we have given this case close and careful consideration. We must find some better way of demonstrating our conscientiousness." ...|$|E
