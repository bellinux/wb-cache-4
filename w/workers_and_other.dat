The ants are both diurnal and nocturnal and forage on trees, in low {{vegetation}} and into human homes, where they are regarded as pests. These ants eat a variety of foods, including fruits, insects, sucrose, nectar and bird feces. They visit various flowers and attend {{to a variety of}} butterfly larvae. The thorny devil, an Australian lizard, predominantly feeds on Ochetellus <b>workers,</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> ant species also prey on them.|$|E

25|$|Yehuda Blum, in {{a speech}} to the United Nations Security Council {{following}} the attack, claimed that the operation was launched on a Sunday afternoon under the assumption that workers present on the site, including foreign experts employed at the reactor, would have left.

25|$|Conditions {{improved}} somewhat {{with the}} advent of the New Deal and the Roosevelt administration's creation of the Works Progress Administration, a public works project that employed thousands of iron <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> construction workers. The union was also spurred to organize, particularly in the inside fabricating shops, by the threat of competition from the newly created Congress of Industrial Organizations. The union's membership grew slowly, reaching 40,000 by 1940.|$|E

After strangling them, he would dump their bodies in forested and overgrown areas in King County, often returning to the dead bodies to have sexual intercourse with them.|$|E
25|$|Within the AFL, the ACWA {{was one of}} {{the strongest}} advocates for {{organizing}} the mass production industries, such as automobile manufacture and steel, where unions had almost no presence, as well as the textile industry, which was only partially organized. Hillman {{was one of the}} original founders in 1935 of the Committee for Industrial Organizing, an effort led by John L. Lewis, and the ACWA followed the Mine <b>Workers</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> unions out of the AFL in 1937 to establish the CIO as a separate union confederation.|$|E
25|$|The union also {{returned}} to its radical political traditions, {{as members of the}} Communist Party USA came to hold the presidency of the union in the late 1940s. That, however, sparked further disagreements over leadership and expenditures and, as the postwar red scare picked up momentum, prompted raids by the United Steelworkers of America, the United Auto <b>Workers</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> unions, particularly in mining in the South, where the CIO encouraged predominantly white miners' locals to defect. The CIO formally expelled the union in 1950 after it refused to remove its communist leaders.|$|E

25|$|Following his {{re-election}} as president in 1961, Hoffa worked {{to expand the}} union. In 1964, he succeeded in bringing virtually all over-the-road truck drivers in North America under a single National Master Freight Agreement, in {{what may have been}} his finest achievement in a lifetime of union activity. He then tried to bring the airline <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> transport employees into the union, with limited success. During this period, he was facing immense personal strain as he was under investigation, on trial, launching appeals of convictions, or imprisoned for virtually all of the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|The union {{also found}} itself {{challenged}} by {{a change in}} the business climate in the 1970s, as non-union contractors invaded markets that had been solidly union for years {{with the support of the}} Business Roundtable, made up of the heads of General Motors, General Electric, Exxon, U.S. Steel, DuPont and others. The Roundtable also attempted to weaken the Davis-Bacon Act and other legislation that protected construction workers. The Iron <b>Workers</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> building trades, caught off guard and used to organizing from the top down, lost large amounts of work to non-union contractors in the decades that followed.|$|E
25|$|Another of Ybor’s {{modifications}} to the company town model was that his community was not a one-(or even two-) company town. To {{increase the number of}} jobs (and thus the pool of available workers), Ybor encouraged other cigar manufacturers to move to his new colony by offering cheap land and a free factory building if they agreed to meet certain job-creation quotas. Even with these inducements, cigar <b>workers</b> <b>and</b> <b>other</b> cigar manufacturers were slow in coming to what was still a primitive settlement - few were willing to take the risk of moving to and buying a home in a new place that might not last.|$|E

A Polish journalist Marcin Suder was captured in July 2013 but escaped four months later. The unit executed American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and released beheading videos. Eight of the other journalists were released for ransom: Danish journalist Daniel Rye Ottosen, French journalists Didier François, Edouard Elias, Nicolas Hénin, and Pierre Torres, and Spanish journalists Marc Marginedas, Javier Espinosa, and Ricardo García Vilanova. The unit continues to hold hostage British journalist John Cantlie and a female aid worker.|$|E
