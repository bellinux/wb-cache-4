5|$|In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell {{was awarded}} the first U.S. patent for the telephone. Thomas Edison's {{research}} laboratory, {{one of the first}} of its kind, developed the phonograph, the first long-lasting light bulb, and the first viable movie camera. The latter lead to emergence of the worldwide entertainment industry. In the early 20th century, the automobile companies of Ransom E. Olds and Henry Ford popularized the assembly line. The <b>Wright</b> <b>brothers,</b> in 1903, made the first sustained and controlled heavier-than-air powered flight.|$|E
5|$|The {{milestones}} in the Civil Air Patrol Cadet Program are the <b>Wright</b> <b>brothers</b> Award, the General Billy Mitchell Award, the Amelia Earhart Award, the General Ira C.

5|$|Verville {{was born}} in Atlantic Mine, {{a small town in}} Michigan's Upper Peninsula, on November 16, 1890, as the son of Victor Verville and Fabianna Miron. As a child, his mother bought him a Conyne-style box kite from Sears Roebuck, which {{captured}} his imagination and started his interest in flight and aviation. Verville also began reading stories about the <b>Wright</b> <b>Brothers</b> in newspapers and magazines with great interest. Later he even wrote to the Wrights and Glenn Curtiss and received responses.|$|E

Since her official retirement, she has remained active on several faculty projects at Harvey Mudd College, in addition to working as a lecturer, consultant, and curator of the Aeronautical Library Special Collections at the university's Sprague Library. She {{has been a member of}} the Ninety-Nines, an organization dedicated to the support of women pilots, since 1952.|$|E
5|$|Five {{years after}} the {{pioneering}} flight of the <b>Wright</b> <b>brothers</b> on 17 December 1903, Thomas Selfridge became the first fatality of powered flight while flying as a passenger with Orville Wright during {{a demonstration of the}} Wright Model A at Fort Myer, Virginia, on 17 September 1908. Eugène Lefebvre was the first pilot killed in a power airplane in 1909, while the first fatal mid-air collision occurred on 19 June 1912, near Douai, France, killing the pilot of each aircraft. Since the deaths of these early aviation pioneers, the scale of fatal aircraft accidents has increased in proportion to the size and capacity of airplanes.|$|E
5|$|Following the flight, President Lyndon B. Johnson asked Armstrong and {{his wife}} {{to take part in}} a 24-day {{goodwill}} tour of South America. Also on the tour, which took in 11 countries and 14 major cities, were Dick Gordon, George Low, their wives, and other government officials. In Paraguay, Armstrong impressed dignitaries by greeting them in their local language, Guarani; in Brazil he talked about the exploits of the Brazilian-born Alberto Santos-Dumont, who was regarded as having beaten the <b>Wright</b> <b>brothers</b> with the first flying machine with his 14-bis.|$|E

5000|$|Headway was a five piece British Britpop revival {{band from}} Hucknall, Nottinghamshire. In early 2003, {{childhood}} friends singer/guitarist, David Wright, and guitarist, Joe Watts, recruited two more members. These were Dave Astbury on bass and Johnny Dakers on drums (later replaced by David <b>Wright's</b> <b>brother</b> Jay). The keyboardist Tom Harrison was added and Headway had fully formed.|$|R
5|$|He {{ranks as}} an early pioneer of aviation, having built and flown his own inventions at a time roughly {{contemporaneous}} with the <b>Wright</b> <b>brothers</b> during the heady, pre-World War I era of aeroplane vogue. He was accepted into the exclusive pioneers' club of Early Birds of Aviation soon after its 1928 foundation, and he was formally added to the Kansas Aviation Museum's Hall of Fame in 1997. A single example of Longren's aircraft – the 1914 pusher biplane that he crashed in Abilene – remains on permanent exhibit at the Kansas Museum of History.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Wright</b> <b>brothers,</b> Orville (August 19, 1871– January 30, 1948) and Wilbur (April 16, 1867– May 30, 1912), {{were two}} American aviators, engineers, inventors, and {{aviation}} pioneers who are generally credited after receiving {{information from the}} government meteorologist stationed there. Kitty Hawk, although remote, was closer to Dayton than other places Chanute had suggested, including California and Florida. The spot also gave them privacy from reporters, who had turned the 1896 Chanute experiments at Lake Michigan into something of a circus. Chanute visited them in camp each season from 1901 to 1903 and saw gliding experiments, but not the powered flights.|$|E
5|$|The {{lawsuits}} {{damaged the}} public {{image of the}} <b>Wright</b> <b>brothers,</b> who were generally regarded before this as heroes. Critics said the brothers were greedy and unfair and compared their actions unfavorably to European inventors, who worked more openly. Supporters said the brothers were protecting their interests and were justified in expecting fair compensation for the years of work leading to their successful invention. Their 10-year friendship with Octave Chanute, already strained by tension over how much credit, if any, he might deserve for their success, collapsed after he publicly criticized their actions.|$|E
50|$|The Howard Wright 1910 {{monoplane}} {{was one of}} {{a series}} of similar aircraft designed by W.O. Manning for Howard T Wright during 1909 and 1910.

5|$|Dayton {{has been}} the home for many patents and inventions since the 1870s. According to the National Park Service, citing {{information}} from the U.S. Patent Office, Dayton had granted more patents per capita than any other U.S. city in 1890 and ranked fifth in the nation as early as 1870. The <b>Wright</b> <b>brothers,</b> inventors of the airplane, and Charles F. Kettering, world-renowned for his numerous inventions, hailed from Dayton. The city was also home to James Ritty's Incorruptible Cashier, the first mechanical cash register, and Arthur E. Morgan's hydraulic jump, a flood prevention mechanism that helped pioneer hydraulic engineering. Paul Laurence Dunbar, an African-American poet and novelist, penned his most famous works in the late 19th century and became {{an integral part of}} the city's history.|$|E
5|$|Krusty, {{refusing to}} submit to Bob's demands, takes refuge in a civil defense shack in the desert, which he uses to {{transmit}} a heavily improvised show. Bart and Lisa {{find their way into}} the cockpit of the Duff Blimp, where Bob, having lost his patience thanks to Krusty, tries to detonate the bomb, which {{turns out to be a}} dud. Lisa alerts the police to Bob's location, but Bob deflates the blimp and kidnaps Bart, before stealing the original <b>Wright</b> <b>Brothers</b> aircraft, which had been an exhibit at the air show. Bob attempts to carry out a kamikaze attack against the civil defense shack where Krusty is hiding, but the slow-moving plane ends up merely bouncing harmlessly off the shack. The authorities quickly arrest Bob and take him into custody while Bart is reunited with his family.|$|E
5|$|The Wrights {{were glad}} {{to be free from}} the {{distraction}} of reporters. The absence of newsmen also reduced the chance of competitors learning their methods. After the Kitty Hawk powered flights, the Wrights made a decision to begin withdrawing from the bicycle business so they could concentrate on creating and marketing a practical airplane. This was financially risky, since they were neither wealthy nor government-funded (unlike other experimenters such as Ader, Maxim, Langley and Alberto Santos-Dumont). The <b>Wright</b> <b>brothers</b> did not have the luxury of being able to give away their invention; it was to be their livelihood. Thus, their secrecy intensified, encouraged by advice from their patent attorney, Henry Toulmin, not to reveal details of their machine.|$|E
50|$|Before European {{settlers}} arrived, native {{inhabitants of}} the region included the Adena culture of Ohio and nearby states, and the subsequent Hopewell culture known from Illinois to Ohio and renowned for their geometric earthworks. Several surviving examples of earthen mounds made by Mound builders still exist at the <b>Wright</b> <b>Brother's</b> Memorial atop the bluff overlooking Huffman Prairie, and another lies {{on the grounds of}} the base.|$|R
50|$|Myron B. <b>Wright</b> (<b>brother</b> of Charles Frederick Wright) {{was born}} at Forest Lake, Pennsylvania. He {{attended}} the common schools and pursued an academic course. He taught school {{and worked as a}} clerk in the First National Bank of Susquehanna in 1865 and 1866. He was elected assistant cashier of the bank in 1867 and cashier in 1869. He was interested in several financial, business, and manufacturing enterprises.|$|R
5000|$|An early {{development}} of an experimental tramway in Toronto, Ontario was built in 1883, having been developed by John Joseph <b>Wright,</b> <b>brother</b> of swindler Whitaker Wright. While Wright may have assisted in the installation of electric railways at the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), and may even have used a pole system, {{there is no evidence}} about this. Likewise, Wright never filed or was issued a patent.|$|R
5|$|After {{their return}} to the U.S., the {{brothers}} and Katharine were invited to the White House where President Taft bestowed awards upon them. Dayton followed up with a lavish two-day homecoming celebration. In July 1909 Orville, with Wilbur assisting, completed the proving flights for the U.S. Army, meeting the requirements of a two-seater able to fly with a passenger for an hour {{at an average of}} speed of 40 miles an hour (64km/h) and land undamaged. They sold the airplane to the Army's Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps for $30,000 (which included a $5,000 bonus for exceeding the speed specification). Wilbur climaxed an extraordinary year in early October when he flew at New York City's Hudson-Fulton celebrations, circling the Statue of Liberty and making a 33-minute flight up and down the Hudson River alongside Manhattan in view of up to one million New Yorkers. These flights solidly established the fame of the <b>Wright</b> <b>brothers</b> in America.|$|E
5|$|Just {{past the}} Capital Beltway, the route {{heads into the}} heart of the city of Greenbelt, having an {{interchange}} with MD193 (Greenbelt Road). The headquarters of the U.S. Park Police, which patrol this portion of the parkway, is located off this exit along MD193. MD193 provides access to College Park, which is home to the College Park Airport, a 1909 airport where the <b>Wright</b> <b>Brothers</b> taught the U.S. Army how to fly an airplane, and the University of Maryland, College Park, a public educational institution established in 1862. At the northern edge of the town, the route has employee-only access to the Goddard Space Flight Center, the first NASA space flight center opened in 1958 that contributed majorly to many space missions; from here, the route then enters the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, the largest agricultural research center in the world owned by the United States Department of Agriculture. The parkway's only interchange within the center is at Powder Mill Road, south of Capitol College.|$|E
5|$|Late on Monday 4November, Catesby, John Wright and Bates {{left for}} the Midlands, ready for the planned uprising. That night Fawkes was {{discovered}} guarding the gunpowder in the undercroft beneath the House of Lords. As news of his arrest spread, the next day most of the conspirators still in London fled. Catesby's party, ignorant {{of what was happening}} in London, paused at Dunstable when his horse lost a shoe. When Rookwood caught them up and broke to them the news of Fawkes's arrest, the group, which now included Rookwood, Catesby, Bates, the <b>Wright</b> <b>brothers</b> and Percy, rode toward Dunchurch. At about 6:00pm that evening they reached Catesby's family home at Ashby St Ledgers, where his mother and Robert Wintour were staying. To keep his mother ignorant of their situation, Catesby sent a message asking Wintour to meet him {{at the edge of the}} town. The group continued to Dunchurch, where they met Digby and his hunting party and informed them that the king and Salisbury were dead, thus persuading them to continue with the plan.|$|E
