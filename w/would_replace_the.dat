5|$|In 1942, Mayor Benjamin F. Barnes of Yonkers {{proposed}} that the Getty Square Branch of the New York Central's Putnam Division be acquired for {{an extension of the}} IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line from Van Cortlandt Park. This service <b>would</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> service operated by the New York Central, which was slated to be discontinued by the New York Central.|$|E
5|$|In March 2005, Intel {{announced}} that it was working on a new Itanium processor, codenamed Tukwila, to be released in 2007. Tukwila would have four processor cores and <b>would</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> Itanium bus with a new Common System Interface, which would also be used by a new Xeon processor.|$|E
5|$|On April 14, 2017, Representative Earl Blumenauer {{introduced}} the Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity Act. This bill <b>would</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> Cabinet {{as the body}} that, together with the Vice President, determines whether Section 4 should be invoked. Under the bill, an eleven-member commission would conduct {{an examination of the}} President when directed to do so by a concurrent resolution of the Congress.|$|E
5000|$|A {{formerly}} planned {{variant of}} Cygnus <b>would</b> have <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> PCM with the Unpressurized Cargo Module (UCM), based on NASA's ExPRESS Logistics Carrier, {{and would have}} been used to transport unpressurized cargo, such as ISS Orbital Replacement Units. Another proposed variant <b>would</b> have <b>replaced</b> <b>the</b> PCM with the Return Cargo Module (RCM), which would have allowed Cygnus to return cargo to Earth.|$|R

5|$|The {{title was}} retired on April 3, 2016, at WrestleMania 32, after WWE Hall of Famer Lita {{revealed}} the new WWE Women's Championship <b>would</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> Divas Championship. Reigning champion Charlotte defeated Becky Lynch and Sasha Banks in a triple threat match {{at the event}} to become the new Women's Champion and therefore the final Divas Champion.|$|E
5|$|In May 1921 {{the policy}} of the Canadian {{government}} towards Arctic expeditions changed with the advent of a new Prime Minister, Arthur Meighen, who withdrew support from Shackleton's proposal. Shackleton was required to rethink his plans, and decided to sail for the Antarctic instead. A varied programme of exploration, coastal mapping, mineral prospecting and oceanographic research in southern waters <b>would</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> abandond Beaufort Sea venture.|$|E
5|$|The {{museum is}} {{scheduled}} for remodeling {{as part of the}} $2 billion Smithsonian South Mall project. Plans from the Danish architects, Bjarke Ingels Group, <b>would</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> above-ground pavilion with new mall-facing entrances. The renovation is supported by private and federal investment, and was expected to begin in 2016 and finish in 10 to 20 years. Yinka Shonibare's Wind Sculpture VII was put on permanent display outside the museum in late 2016.|$|E

5|$|During 1999, {{domestic}} air {{ticket prices}} increased 9.2%, and another 17% the following year. By 2001, the domestic capacity was {{below the level}} before Gardermoen opened. Braathens and SAS started cooperating to set the full-price tickets on routes to eleven cities. This meant that the prices were identical on all the routes where both airlines flew, although they {{were not allowed to}} make such cooperation with discounted tickets. During the crisis, Braathens had sold several aircraft and started leasing them back to gain liquidity. The company announced in 2000 that they were considering purchasing a smaller type of aircraft, that <b>would</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> 737s on some routes, and that would allow Braathens to start operating the Norwegian Air Shuttle services themselves.|$|E
5|$|However, {{no further}} tram lines were closed. In 1969, {{the site of}} the turning loop at Sinsen needed to be moved to allow the {{construction}} of the Sinsen Interchange. Instead of closing the line, Oslo Sporveier chose to build a new loop at Muselunden at Sinsen. The Ekeberg Line was scheduled to close in 1972, because a new line needed to be built to allow passage during the construction of Oslo Central Station, which <b>would</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> Østbanen. After heavy protests from Ekeberg residents, Oslo Sporveier chose to build a loop in Vognmannsgata in the city centre.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, The New York Times {{reported}} that Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration had been considering an extension to Hoboken and to Secaucus Junction in New Jersey, {{where it would}} connect with most New Jersey Transit commuter lines. It would offer New Jersey commuters a direct route to Grand Central Terminal on the East Side of Manhattan and connections to most other New York City subway routes. If opened, the extension would take the New York City Subway outside the state's borders for the first time. The plan <b>would</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> Access to the Region's Core (ARC) tunnel, which was canceled by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in October 2010.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, NSB {{decided that they}} <b>would</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> {{intercity}} trains with the Class 73 tilting multiple unit, and the locomotives for loco-hauled trains with the Swiss-designed El 18 (also with electric equipment from ABB, former BBC). In 1997, no. 2226 was put aside, and scrapped the following year. From 1998, the second series of El 17 was put into service on the Flåm Line, a steep tourist line that connects to the Bergen Line. The units were painted green and connected {{at each end of}} a train of six B3 passenger cars. From 2003, the first series was taken out of regular service, and units 2222, 2224 and 2225 were put into shunting service at Lodalen. Unit 2223 was transferred to the Norwegian Railway Museum, where it was put on display.|$|E
5|$|Plans to {{construct}} a road from Brawley to Glamis date from 1953; the road would provide improved access to two newer state parks. The ceding of the Chocolate Mountains to the U.S. Navy had closed a north–south road traversing Imperial County, and the government needed to restore a corridor for local residents to use, as the road was closed during the day for five days a week. However, in August, the Riverside Chamber of Commerce opposed the construction, even though it <b>would</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> Niland–Blythe road. The chamber reversed its stance in December, as the road would mostly be constructed in Imperial County.|$|E
5|$|The A-10A single-seat variant was {{the only}} version produced, though one {{pre-production}} airframe was modified into the YA-10B twin-seat prototype to test an all-weather night capable version. In 2005, a program was started to upgrade remaining A-10A aircraft to the A-10C configuration, with modern avionics for use with precision weaponry. The U.S. Air Force had stated the F-35 <b>would</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> A-10 as it entered service, but this remains highly contentious within the Air Force and in political circles. With a variety of upgrades and wing replacements, the A-10's service life may be extended to 2040; the Air Force has no planned retirement date as of June 2017.|$|E

50|$|The Soviets soon {{developed}} the 7.62×39mm M43 cartridge, the semi-automatic SKS carbine and the RPD light machine gun. Shortly after World War II, the Soviets {{developed the}} AK-47 assault rifle, which <b>would</b> quickly <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> SKS in Soviet service. In the 1960s, the Soviets introduced the RPK light machine gun, an AK-47 type weapon with a stronger receiver, a longer heavy barrel, and a bipod, that <b>would</b> eventually <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> RPD light machine gun.|$|R

5|$|This year, {{the first}} ever EA Sports Jersey Creator Contest was held to design the jerseys for both the rookie and the sophomore team. The contest called for the {{participants}} {{to come up with}} a computer-generated jersey design that <b>would</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> individual team jerseys worn by the players during the Rookie Challenge. Of 12,000 participants, 18-year-old Tim Ahmed, a freshman at Baruch College, won the contest. Ahmed won a free trip to Phoenix and a chance to meet players. This marks the first time that a fan-designed uniform has ever been worn during an NBA game or NBA event. The Sophomores wore fan-designed white jerseys and the Rookies wore fan-designed purple jerseys in the game.|$|E
5|$|A second Legislative Council {{election}} {{was held in}} 1951 {{with the number of}} elected seats increased to nine. This {{election was}} again dominated by the SPP which won six seats. While this contributed to the formation of a distinct local government of Singapore, the colonial administration was still dominant. In 1953, with the communists in Malaya suppressed and the worst of the Emergency over, a British Commission, headed by Sir George Rendel, proposed a limited form of self-government for Singapore. A new Legislative Assembly with twenty-five out of thirty-two seats chosen by popular election <b>would</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> Legislative Council, from which a Chief Minister as head of government and Council of Ministers as a cabinet would be picked under a parliamentary system. The British would retain control over areas such as internal security and foreign affairs, as well as veto power over legislation.|$|E
5|$|At 02:45 on 10 May, in {{conjunction}} with the ground assault on the Ngok Tavak outpost, elements of the VPA 2nd Division subjected Khâm Đức to a heavy barrage of mortar fire. The North Vietnamese 21st Regiment, later reinforced by the VC 1st Regiment, were in position to attack the U.S.-led Detachment A-105. At 08:30, the Americal Division activated Operation Golden Valley to reinforce the beleaguered Khâm Đức Special Forces Camp, and at 8:45am the division requested permission from III MAF to change the reaction force so the 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment, 196th Light Infantry Brigade (2–1st Inf) <b>would</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> 1st Battalion, 46th Infantry Regiment, 198th Light Infantry Brigade (1–46th Inf). In the meantime, however, Company A of 1–46th Inf provide the needed reinforcement, until the 2–1st Inf was in position. At around 10:50 Company A of 1–46th Infantry – led by Lieutenant Bobby Thompson – arrived in Khâm Đức along with some supporting artillery and ammunition, and they were immediately assigned to their task.|$|E

5|$|By 1966, Braathens SAFE {{had sold}} all its DC-4s, and had {{purchased}} eight F-27s. The DC-6s were used exclusively for charter, with all domestic flights being flown with the F-27s. The same year, the booking system was centralized {{and moved to}} offices in Oslo. The company established sales offices in Bodø and Tromsø on 1 March 1967. A new cargo department was opened at Oslo Airport on 29 September. Braathens SAFE applied in {{a joint venture with}} the Norwegian America Line to start a cargo flight to the United States and the Far East, but this was declined by the ministry. From 1967, also DC-6s were used on domestic routes. In August, it was announced that Braathens SAFE <b>would</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> F-27s with six new Fokker F-28, and that the F-27s would be sold to the manufacturer. Later, the number of orders of 737s was reduced to two, and of F-28s to five. The Fellowships cost NOK40 million each.|$|E
5|$|The Port Authority {{voted to}} proceed with the {{scaled-down}} system in 1996. A final environmental impact statement (FEIS) for the JFK people mover, conducted by the Port Authority and released in 1997, examined eight possible transport improvements that could be constructed in order to provide this direct connection. Ultimately, a light rail with the qualities of a people mover, tentatively called the JFK Light Rail System, was selected as the most feasible mode of transportation for the new system. It <b>would</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> shuttle buses that traveled between the terminals as well as to and from Howard Beach. The FEIS determined that an automated system with frequent headways was the most optimal design. The light rail would run from the airport terminals to either Jamaica or Howard Beach. It had been almost 30 years between the first JFK rail link proposal and the approval of the light rail system; within that time period, there had been 21 proposals for direct rail links to New York-area airports, which were all canceled.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{determined that}} it did not need to go ahead with an immediate replacement for the Canberra and preferred Hancock's original choice of the TFX as a long-term solution, leading to the Menzies government's announcement on 24 October that it was ordering 24 F-111s for US$125 million, enough for two squadrons. The announcement came during the campaigning for the 1963 general election. Calwell's Labor party had on 22 October reiterated its pre-campaign promise that it <b>would</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> Canberras as soon as it formed a government. The government's announcement, and the consequent improvement of its chances against Labor, likely also benefited the United States; the purchase helped rebut American critics of the TFX, and the Kennedy administration preferred Menzies' defence policies to the opposition's. The contract was signed the following year through the U.S. Department of Defense. The British government's cancellation of the TSR-2 in April 1965 showed that Australia's decision to not order it was correct.|$|E
