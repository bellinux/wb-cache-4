30|$|The {{recognition}} {{problem for}} a class of graphs {{is equivalent to the}} particular graph sandwich problem where E 1 =E 2, that is, the optional edge set is empty. Graph sandwich problems have attracted much attention lately because of many applications and {{by the fact that they}} naturally generalize recognition problems [2]-[6]. Note that Π-SP is clearly at least as hard as the problem of recognizing graphs with property Π, since given a polynomial-time algorithm for Π-SP, it is possible to use this algorithm with E 1 =E 2 =E to recognize if a graph G=(V,E) satisfies property Π. Thus, in such cases, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>problems</b> in P that cannot be easier when regarded as sandwich problems.|$|E
