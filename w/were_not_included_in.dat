5|$|During the Middle Ages, Capetian Kings of France {{chose to}} have their heirs {{apparent}} crowned during their own lifetime {{in order to avoid}} succession disputes. This practice was later adopted by Angevin Kings of England, Kings of Hungary and other European monarchs. From the moment of their coronation, the heirs were regarded as junior kings (rex iunior), but they exercised little power and historically <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> the numbering of monarchs if they predeceased their fathers. The nobility disliked this custom, as it reduced their chances to benefit from a possible succession dispute.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{preliminary}} peace in 1712, the Treaty of Utrecht ended {{the war in}} 1713.

The Lost Coast level was originally created for Half-Life 2, but was ultimately removed from the game. As a result, it has several minor story details that <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> Half-Life 2. The level received a generally positive reception, and there was consensus among reviewers that the new features included in Lost Coast should be integrated into future games released by Valve.|$|E

5|$|During the 1996 season, the Orange Bowl was {{a member}} of the Bowl Alliance, a {{precursor}} to the modern Bowl Championship Series. The Bowl Alliance was formed prior to the 1995 college football season in an effort to match the No. 1 and No. 2 teams at the conclusion of the regular season while also ensuring other high-ranking teams were allowed to participate in high-profile bowl games. The Alliance included the Southeastern Conference, Big 12 Conference, Atlantic Coast Conference, and Big East Conference. As agreed, the champions of each conference would play in one of three Bowl Alliance games: the Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, and Fiesta Bowl. The Big Ten and Pac-10 conferences, which had a separate agreement with the Rose Bowl, <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> the Bowl Alliance until 1998, when the Alliance became the Bowl Championship Series.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{assessed}} both Coquerel's giant {{mouse lemur}} {{and the northern}} giant mouse lemur as endangered. Prior to that, both species had been listed as vulnerable. Populations of both species are in decline due to habitat destruction, primarily for slash-and-burn agriculture and charcoal production. Also, they are both hunted for bushmeat. The population announced by the WWF in 2010 was found outside the limits of a nearby protected area, PK32-Ranobe, which was granted temporary protection status in December 2008 and is co-managed by the WWF.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, the Ottomans {{inspected}} the fleet and found that almost all of the vessels, including both Asar-i Şevket-class ships, to be completely unfit for combat against the Greek Navy. Following {{the end of the war}} with Greece, the government decided to begin a naval reconstruction program. Asar-i Şevket and Necm-i Şevket proved to be in too poor a condition to merit rebuilding, and they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> the program. The former was decommissioned in 1903 and sold for scrap in 1909. Necm-i Şevket lingered on in service as a barracks ship until the outbreak of the First Balkan War in 1912. Bulgarian forces threatened to capture Constantinople, and so the Navy pressed the ship back into service to provide gunfire support to the Ottoman defenders. After the threat passed, she returned to barracks ship duties, a role she filled until 1929, when she was decommissioned after nearly sixty years in service.|$|E
5|$|Isobel (known as Iso) Rae (18 August 1860– 16 March 1940) was an Australian impressionist painter. After {{training}} at Melbourne's National Gallery of Victoria Art School, where she studied alongside Frederick McCubbin and Jane Sutherland, Rae travelled to France in 1887 with her family, and {{spent most of}} the rest of her life there. A longstanding member of the Étaples art colony, Rae lived in or near the village of Étaples from the 1890s until the 1930s. During that period, Rae exhibited her paintings at the Royal Society of British Artists, the Society of Oil Painters, and the Paris Salon. During World War I, she was a member of the Voluntary Aid Detachment and worked throughout the war in Étaples Army Base Camp. She and Jessie Traill were the only Australian women to live and paint in France during the war, however they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> their country's first group of official war artists. Following Hitler's rise to power, Rae moved to south-eastern England, where she died in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Max Mosley {{was born}} on 3 April 1940 in London, {{in the early years}} of the Second World War. His father, Sir Oswald Mosley, had been a Labour minister, and a Member of Parliament for both the Conservative and Labour parties in the 1920s before leaving {{mainstream}} politics and becoming leader of the British Union of Fascists (BUF) in the 1930s. The month after Max's birth, Sir Oswald, who had campaigned for a negotiated peace between the United Kingdom and Nazi Germany, was interned by the British Authorities under Defence Regulation 18B, along with other active fascists in Britain. Max's mother, Lady Diana Mosley, was imprisoned a month later. Max and his older brother Alexander <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> their parents' internment and as a result were separated from them for the first few years of their lives. In December 1940, then-prime minister Winston Churchill, asked Home Secretary Herbert Morrison to ensure Lady Mosley was able to see Max regularly.|$|E

5|$|Seventy {{minutes of}} footage, mostly {{dealing with the}} origin, <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> the final cut. Much of this back-story was unscripted and the filmmakers were never sure of {{including}} it into the final cut, and had considered releasing some of these clips on the internet. Editor Kyle Cooper, creator of the Marvel logo (with the flipping pages) and the montage detailing Iron Man's biography in that film, edited together much of this footage into the opening credits. Leterrier explained a negative test screening, where flashbacks were placed across the film that the audience found too similar to Hulk, had resulted in compressing these to the film's start. This replaced the original opening, where Banner comes to the Arctic to commit suicide. When the scene ends, in an instant the frozen body of Captain America is partially seen in the ice. Leterrier {{said he did not}} want this scene to be lost amid the opening montage.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{version of the}} bill, introduced in the House of Representatives on February 16, 1925 by Pennsylvania Congressman George P. Darrow and in the Senate by that state's George W. Pepper, called for a $1.50 gold coin for the 150th anniversary, for commemorative half dollars, and for a $1 bill honoring the Declaration of Independence. A hearing was held before the House Committee on Industrial Arts and Expositions two days later, at which Congressman Darrow predicted that the $1.50 gold pieces would not be opposed by either the Treasury or the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, but he was incorrect; Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon would not support them. The Commission also hoped to have commemoratives depicting the enlargement of the country through acquisitions such as the Louisiana Purchase and the Annexation of Texas, but these <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> {{the final version of}} the bill. Nevertheless, the Commission continued to pursue congressional approval of the $1.50 piece and the other proposed commemoratives at least through August 1925.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} the raid are {{difficult}} to judge given the confusion over loss records. It is likely more aircraft were destroyed than listed. The Americans failed to keep a proper record of their losses and it appears the U.S. 8th Air Force losses <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> loss totals. When these estimates and figures {{are added to the}} losses listed in the table below, {{it is likely that the}} correct figures are 232 destroyed (143 single-engine, 74 twin-engine and 15 four-engine) and 156 damaged (139 single-engine, 12 twin-engine and five four-engine). Researching individual squadron records confirms the destruction of even more USAAF aircraft. This suggests at least a further 16 B-17s, 14 B-24s, eight P-51s, and at least two P-47s were destroyed on top of that total. A total of 290 destroyed and 180 damaged seems a more realistic summation than the conservative figures given by the USAAF, RAF, and RCAF. Including the 15 Allied aircraft shot down and 10 damaged in aerial combat, 305 destroyed and 190 damaged is the sum total of the attack.|$|E
