2500|$|Some Class 24s were {{withdrawn}} in 1973 {{with the}} closure of the Waverley route, which linked [...] and Edinburgh, but most of these were put into storage and subsequently re-entered traffic to fill gaps left by the movement of Class 25s to cover the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Class</b> 22s on the Western Region. Thus Class 24 withdrawals only started in earnest with completion of the Glasgow electrification in 1974, and re-allocation of Class 26 and Class 27 locos saw the Class 24s concentrated around various Lancashire depots and at Carlisle. On 27 November 1976 there were just ten Class 24s still in operational service, all allocated to Crewe Diesel Depot (depot code CD). However, with the reinstatement of 24082 and 24073 this number climbed to 12 by February 1977.|$|E
50|$|A major {{accident}} occurred at Betriebswerk Hof on 2 September 2001. The ICE-TD unit, number 605 009, {{fell from the}} lifting platform (Hebebühne) and was badly damaged. The vehicle was initially kept for spare parts but, after the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Class</b> 605, it was taken away to Chemnitz for scrapping {{on the night of}} 18/19 April 2004 on a low loader.|$|E

50|$|<b>Withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>class</b> {{took place}} between February 1961 and April 1963 and were all scrapped. None have survived to preservation.|$|R
50|$|All 60 <b>of</b> the <b>class</b> were {{originally}} built with Westinghouse air brakes. Forty-two were fitted with vacuum ejectors in a programme during 1929 and 1930. However, <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>class</b> {{had begun in}} 1928 and 18 <b>of</b> the <b>class</b> never received vacuum ejectors.|$|R
5000|$|Most British Rail Class 415 {{units were}} {{withdrawn}} in the mid-1980s, owing to their partial replacement by newer stock {{such as the}} British Rail Class 455 units {{and the fact that}} many units contained asbestos. However, a significant number of the units were [...] "facelifted". The asbestos was removed and the units' interiors were improved. This resulted in some re-numbering of stock, so that the earlier units built {{in the style of the}} Southern Railway became the 54xx series whilst the British Railways style units became the 56xx series. Some of the 56xx series units received express gear ratios to allow them to work services between London and Kent Coast destinations. Although all the non-refurbished BR Class 415/2s were withdrawn, three Class 415/1s of Southern Railway outline survived until the final <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Class</b> 415 stock in 1995. These units included 5001, the first unit constructed, and 5176. Both of these units were repainted into liveries previously carried by the class, 5001 receiving British Railways green livery with yellow warning panels and 5176 receiving British Rail blue livery with full yellow ends.|$|E
50|$|After the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Class</b> 411 Ceps, {{services}} from August 1998 to December 2006 were {{operated by the}} Class 508. From the December 2006 timetable change, the two coach Class 466 are used.|$|R
2500|$|Initially {{services}} {{were provided by}} Class 303 and Class 314 units. The latter were built specifically for this service. Following the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Class</b> 303 units, the service was provided by Class 318 and Class 334 [...] "Juniper" [...] units.|$|R

5000|$|To {{mark the}} {{impending}} <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>class,</b> {{the first two}} locomotives (26007 and 26001) were repainted into 1960s style BR green with small yellow warning panels in 1992, at which point 26001 became {{the first and only}} Class 26 to be named (Eastfield, to commemorate the closure of that depot).|$|R
50|$|After the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Class</b> 15 locomotives, three British Rail Class 20 were {{allocated}} to Stratford for station pilot duties at Liverpool Street station. These were later replaced by Class 08 locomotives but {{the tradition of}} a clean smart engine was maintained {{until the end of}} station pilot duties in the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|While it was {{acquired}} specifically for service on light rail in South West Africa, the Class 32-200s also {{ended up being}} employed in South Africa at times. From 1972 to 1974, between the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Class</b> GO 4-8-2+2-8-4 Garratt locomotives and the arrival <b>of</b> the <b>Class</b> 35-000 diesel-electrics on the line between Amabele and Umtata in Transkei, some of them performed temporary service on that line.|$|R
5000|$|After withdrawal, {{the entire}} class was lined up {{together}} with the two 113 Class locomotives to form a sound barrier around Inchicore Works. Official <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>class</b> came in April 1984, and the majority were scrapped between December 1986 and March 1987. However, No. 103 survived and has been preserved by the Irish Traction Group at Carrick-on-Suir[...]|$|R
5000|$|<b>Withdrawals</b> <b>of</b> the <b>class</b> {{began in}} 1982 and {{modernisation}} {{of the units}} began in 1983, when 10 DMBSO from withdrawn units were converted for use on the Gatwick Express service in conjunction with converted loco-hauled Open First (FO) and Open Second (SO) vehicles and class 73 locomotives. These vehicles were classified as 489 with [...] "units" [...] numbered 9101-9110 and individual carriage numbers 68500-68509.|$|R
5000|$|Nicknamed [...] "Wilson" [...] (in honour of US {{president}} Woodrow Wilson) {{throughout their}} career, the Class 735 locomotives proved very successful; {{they were considered}} by engineers to be somewhat {{more powerful than the}} 740 Class, although their consumes were accordingly higher. Pulling mainly freight trains but often also passenger trains, they operated until the 1960s, when mass <b>withdrawals</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Class</b> began, until the last one was retired in 1971.|$|R
50|$|<b>Withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Class</b> 40s {{started in}} 1976, when three {{locomotives}} (40 005, 40 039 and 40 102) {{were taken out}} of service. At over 130 tons the Class were by then considered underpowered. In addition, some {{were found to be}} suffering from fractures of the plate-frame bogies (due mainly to inappropriate use on wagon-load freight and the associated running into tightly curved yards), and spares were also needed to keep other locomotives running.|$|R
50|$|The SP42 is in {{fact the}} same {{locomotive}} as SM42, but modified for passenger transport. The modification was carried out by adding a heating system for passenger cars on the locomotive. <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> this <b>class</b> started in '90s, some of them was rebuilt into SU42 class (electrical heating instead <b>of</b> steam). SP42 <b>class</b> were totally withdrawn from PKP's service in year 2008. The last one (number 007 from depot Skarżysko Kamienna) made its special run with Bhp class double deckers from Skarżysko to Tomaszów Mazowiecki.|$|R
5|$|Several <b>of</b> the <b>class</b> were loaned to the Great Western Railway between 1942 and 1944 {{to assist}} in bolstering freight power, of which there was an acute {{shortage}} on that railway during the Second World War. The class saw use after nationalisation in 1948, though with increasing numbers of Bulleid Pacifics able to take over their duties, the Remembrance class began to be withdrawn from service during the mid-1950s, starting with Hackworth in 1955, and finally Beattie in 1957. The early <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>class</b> ensured that none were preserved.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of initial {{electric}} services in 1987, Class 318s with occasional Class 303s operated the service. Upon <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Class</b> 303s, introduction <b>of</b> the <b>Class</b> 334s and the redeployment of the Strathclyde electric fleet, the major class on the route became the Class 334, {{with support from the}} Class 318. In 2011, a new fleet of [...] units was being introduced to the line. By June 2011, the former classes became rare, with Class 380 having sole responsibility for the line by the end of 2011.|$|R
50|$|The O4 locos served widely {{throughout}} the LNER system, many being modified to help extend their useful working life on heavy freight trains. Fifty-eight <b>of</b> the <b>class</b> were rebuilt into LNER Thompson Class O1s in 1944-49. 329 LNER O4 locomotives passed to British Railways ownership in 1948. Five locomotives {{were sold to}} the Government in 1952 for use in Egypt, and routine <b>withdrawals</b> <b>of</b> BR's <b>class</b> O4s commenced in December 1958. The last examples <b>of</b> the <b>class</b> were withdrawn from operations in the Doncaster area in April 1966, not long before the abandonment of steam altogether.|$|R
50|$|During its {{working life}} the class {{could be found}} all over the NER system working on {{suburban}} lines and country branch lines. During their life with the LNER they were mostly kept around Tyneside, Teesside, Hull and Leeds where they handled lightweight traffic. <b>Withdrawals</b> <b>of</b> the <b>class</b> began in 1928 and finished in 1938. The last loco was No. 420, working at Tyne Dock. It was condemned on the 22nd of April 1938 and the class slipped into history with none being preserved.|$|R
50|$|The {{units were}} also used on various other routes, {{including}} Coventry to Wolverhampton, and Birmingham to Walsall (Chase Line) suburban services, as well as longer distance Birmingham to Liverpool Lime Street services. On these services, they were used alongside the existing fleets <b>of</b> <b>Class</b> 310/1 and Class 312 slam-door units. The introduction of the new trains also allowed the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the elderly <b>Class</b> 304 units, and the cascading <b>of</b> <b>Class</b> 308 units to operate suburban services around Leeds.|$|R
50|$|In December 2013 VR {{announced}} {{an order for}} 80 new electric locomotives to replace the Sr1 Class. The new locomotives, of the Siemens Vectron design, will be built in Germany by Siemens.http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/traction-rolling-stock/single-view/view/vr-orders-siemens-vectron-locomotives.html The new locomotives {{are scheduled to be}} delivered between 2017 and 2026, resulting in the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the Sr1 <b>class.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{station is}} fully {{operational}} {{today as the}} terminal station on the Glasgow Central - Neilston line. The railway was electrified in May 1962 (using overhead wires supplying 25kV A.C) and Class 303 [...] "Blue Train" [...] electric multiple units provided almost all trains services for many years thereafter, being joined by the similar Class 311 from 1967. Following <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Class</b> 303 and 311, Class 314 have been the mainstay of the service with occasional services operated by Class 318 and Class 334.|$|R
50|$|Essentially a more {{advanced}} version <b>of</b> 1898's WB <b>class,</b> the eighteen members <b>of</b> the WD <b>class</b> were ordered in 1901 and most entered service that year, though three were not introduced until the start of 1902. Based in locations all around the country, from Auckland in the north to Dunedin in the south, the WD class were suitable {{for a variety of}} trains from freight to suburban passenger services. <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>class</b> began with WD 356 in January 1933, with the final three, 327, 359, and 360, written off in March 1936. A number were not actually scrapped or dumped, but were sold to work on private industrial lines.|$|R
25|$|The late 1950s {{to the end}} of the 1960s saw first a reduction, {{then the}} final <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> Britain's fleet of steam locomotives. Mass <b>withdrawals</b> <b>of</b> older <b>classes</b> started towards the end of the 1950s, with many of the pre-grouping companies' engines being scrapped. BR built its last steam engine, {{appropriately}} named Evening Star at Swindon in 1960, by early 1966 the Western Region was the first to have no steam locomotives at all and the last pocket of steam traction was withdrawn in the North-West of England in 1968. The short narrow-gauge Vale of Rheidol Railway at Aberystwyth in Wales was the only exception: it was still steam-operated on its sale by BR in 1989.|$|R
50|$|All 201 <b>of</b> the <b>class</b> {{passed into}} the London and North Eastern Railway {{ownership}} in 1923, and they were classified J21 but without any sub-classes to reflect the different backgrounds or dimensions. The class retained their original North Eastern Railway numbers under the 1924 renumbering scheme. <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>class</b> began in 1929, but proceeded relatively slowly and there were still substantial numbers in service in 1943 when the survivors were renumbered between 5025 and 5123' (with gaps). Eighty-two surviving examples passed into British Railways (BR) ownership in 1948, and renumbered by adding 60000 to their exiting numbers. These were gradually withdrawn from service over the next fourteen years.|$|R
25|$|In the 1960s {{there was}} a mass <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> steam {{locomotive}} <b>classes.</b> Older types were withdrawn in preference to the Standard 4s, which class remained intact until 1964. The final nine were withdrawn from the Southern Region on 9 July 1967. One Scottish Region example, 80002, remained in Glasgow past the end of steam haulage until 1969 as a static carriage heating boiler.|$|R
50|$|<b>Withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the F <b>class</b> {{locomotives}} {{began in}} October 1979 with the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> F214. The remaining locomotives with withdrawn between November 1979 and July 1987, {{when the last}} three locomotives, F202, F208, and F216, were taken out <b>of</b> service. Following <b>withdrawal,</b> the locomotives {{appear to have been}} placed in storage although most were later scrapped. Only one locomotive was broken up in the same year it was withdrawn; F215 was withdrawn in April 1983 and scrapped later that year.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{the ban on}} {{privately owned}} diesel {{locomotives}} operating on BR tracks, railway enthusiasts {{did not have to}} wait that long after the final <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>class</b> to see a Deltic back on the mainline. Following participation in the hastily arranged 'Farewell to the Deltics' open day at British Rail Engineering Limited's Doncaster Works on 27 February 1982, 55 002 left Doncaster under its own power and ran back up the ECML to the National Railway Museum light engine; it was to be some years before a Deltic was officially allowed to run again on the mainline.|$|R
25|$|Despite these design features, no N class {{locomotive}} ever ran {{on standard}} gauge. By {{the time the}} standard gauge Albury to Melbourne mainline opened alongside the existing broad gauge line in 1962, steam locomotives were rapidly being withdrawn from service. Large scale standardisation of Australia's broad gauge rail network did not get underway until 1995, nearly thirty years after the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> the N <b>class.</b>|$|R
50|$|The final duties <b>of</b> the AB <b>class</b> were on branchline workings, {{where they}} found their niche after being {{displaced}} from most mainline duties by larger locomotives. These in turn displaced the A and Q class 4-6-2 locomotives from their duties, resulting in the <b>withdrawal</b> <b>of</b> all Q <b>class</b> locomotives by 1957 {{and a reduction in}} the number <b>of</b> A <b>class</b> locomotives. The locomotives also worked some lesser mainline duties, and others, such as those at Gisborne, were used as bankers to assist trains heading south to Napier.|$|R
