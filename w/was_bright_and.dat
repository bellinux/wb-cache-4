5|$|While sailing {{in these}} latitudes on one very dark night, the sea {{presented}} a wonderful and most beautiful spectacle. There was a fresh breeze, and {{every part of}} the surface, which during the day is seen as foam, now glowed with a pale light. The vessel drove before her bows two billows of liquid phosphorus, and in her wake she was followed by a milky train. As far as the eye reached, the crest of every wave <b>was</b> <b>bright,</b> <b>and</b> the sky above the horizon, from the reflected glare of these livid flames, was not so utterly obscure, as over the rest of the heavens.|$|E
25|$|The Contradanza is a {{communal}} sequence dance, with the dance figures conforming {{to a set}} pattern.

The tempo and style of the music <b>was</b> <b>bright</b> <b>and</b> fairly fast.|$|E
500|$|Symphony No. 5 is an {{abstract}} segment created by Pixote Hunt with story development by Kelvin Yasuda. In December 1997, after rejecting pitches from four other animators, Disney and Ernst asked Hunt for his ideas. Hunt first {{thought of the}} story on a morning walk in Pasadena, California, one depicting a battle of [...] "good" [...] multi-colored shapes against [...] "evil" [...] dark ones and how the conflict resolves itself. It took Hunt approximately two years, from start to finish, to complete the segment. Disney and Ernst decided to go with Hunt's idea; Hunt avoided producing an entirely abstract work because [...] "you can get something abstract on every computer screen" [...] with ease. Hunt divided the segment into 31 mini-scenes, noting down points {{in which he would}} employ vivid color when the music <b>was</b> <b>bright</b> <b>and</b> fluid, and then switch to darker hues when the music felt darker and denser. To gain inspiration in how the shapes would move, Hunt and his associates visited San Diego Zoo, a butterfly farm, and observed slow motion footage of bats. The segment combines hand drawn backgrounds using pastels and paint that were scanned into the Computer Animation Production System (CAPS), and computer-generated imagery (CGI) of abstract shapes and effects, which were layered on top. Hunt explained that scanning each drawing [...] "was a one-shot deal" [...] as the platen that pressed onto it would alter the pastel once it had been scanned. At one point during production, Hunt and Yasuda completed 68 pastel drawings in eight days. The segment was produced using Houdini animation software.|$|E

2500|$|Quiet Giant {{was owned}} by Edward P. [...] "Ned" [...] Evans during {{the early part of}} her racing career. Following Evans' death in 2010, she {{finished}} her racing career under the ownership of his estate and was bought by Besilu Stables as a broodmare prospect at the Keeneland November sale in 2011 for $3 million. Quiet Giant was officially retired from racing and was bred to Candy Ride in 2012, resulting in the birth of Gun Runner at WinStar Farm on March 8, 2013. [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>bright</b> <b>and</b> inquisitive as a young horse, never much trouble and never sick or injured," [...] according to Chris Baker, who was then the general manager of WinStar Farm. Donnie Preston, another WinStar employee, noted that the young Gun Runner had [...] "a little bit of fire to him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Los Gatos {{historian}} William A. Wulf describes Forbes as [...] "a suede-shoe man [...] He <b>was</b> <b>bright,</b> <b>and</b> {{better educated}} than most men in California {{when he first}} arrived. But he was basically a bad guy who ended up losing control of circumstances." [...] When the Jesuits arrived from Oregon to Mission Santa Clara, they asked him {{to move out of}} the mission, which he did, but not before getting $11,000 from them. He then used this money to build a mansion right behind the mission. Later, he sold this to a group of nuns, neglecting to tell them there was a $20,000 lien on the house. Also, according to the Hernandez family, Forbes never paid $8,000 he owed for the Los Gatos rancho. With regards to his marriage, he is described as having treated his wife as a servant, often not allowing her to converse with dinner guests; instead she was made to help the other servants.|$|E
2500|$|Monday 25 September, <b>was</b> <b>bright</b> <b>and</b> cloudless, with {{a ground}} haze but reports from {{observers}} in contact patrol aircraft were notably accurate, as the infantry advanced to their objectives on the Fourth Army front, from Morval to Gueudecourt and around Flers. Observers in reconnaissance aircraft located [...] artillery batteries; [...] engaged and [...] by zone calls. At [...] observers watched the {{advance to the}} final objective and after twenty-one minutes, {{almost all of it}} was reported captured. A map compiled from air reports was later shown to be more accurate than infantry progress reports. The ground not taken near Morval fell in the evening, completing the capture of the ground on the main ridge, making Combles untenable, although British balloon observers were able to see that the French advance from the south had been delayed. There was extensive German air activity during the day but most aircraft flew above , which few British aircraft could reach.|$|E

2500|$|On 28 September, the 53rd Brigade formed {{up for the}} attack, on tapes facing north-west from [...] Trench, the {{left-hand}} battalion to capture the redoubt.

By [...] all of the south face had been captured and the troops were ordered to dig in. The capture of the south face of [...] Redoubt was observed by the crews of RFC contact patrols and artillery observation aircraft directed artillery-fire, which destroyed 16 gun pits, damaged fifteen and destroyed nine ammunition pits. Poor weather restricted flying on 29 September but the next day <b>was</b> <b>bright</b> <b>and</b> low-flying sorties discovered that most of the [...] Redoubt had been captured.|$|E
2500|$|Epiphany {{is known}} in Latvia as Trijkungu diena (Three Kings Day) by Catholics or Zvaigznes diena (Star Day) by Lutherans after the custom of star singing, and the Star of Bethlehem which led the Magi to the Christ Child. In the past bright stars of fabric were sewn onto the {{background}} of dark colored quilts, representing the night sky. Epiphany was a day of enjoyment, spent in horse-drawn open sleighs, and these quilts would then be taken along to cover the laps of the merry riders. If Epiphany Day <b>was</b> <b>bright</b> <b>and</b> mild and the sun [...] "warmed the horses’ backs" [...] {{it was said that}} the coming year would bring only peace. If the night before Epiphany saw clear starry skies, it meant Latvia could expect a fine harvest in the coming Summer. Weaving and wood-cutting were [...] "bad luck", giving both men and women a proper holiday, and if a dog was heard barking on Epiphany one ought to look for his or her future spouse in that same direction. Special three corner apple cakes are eaten on this day, and as in other countries, star singing, visiting and house blessings have long been popular.|$|E
2500|$|The weather on {{the morning}} of 29 June <b>was</b> <b>bright</b> <b>and</b> clear and Allied {{aircraft}} conducted many ground attack sorties and reconnaissance flights, which found that many German reinforcements were heading for the Odon area. The German counter-offensive by the , took place south of the 49th Division, either side of the Odon river between Queudeville and Évrecy, against the VIII Corps salient. XXX Corps provided artillery support to VIII Corps and prepared to defend the ground around Rauray. The 1st Tyneside Scottish found that any movement attracted massed mortar fire from [...] and a tank periodically harassed the company dug in north of the village. The company was withdrawn to avoid an artillery barrage, preparatory to an attack on the village by the 11th DLI {{but as soon as the}} move was spotted, a [...] bombardment began and caused many casualties. The battalion was relieved at [...] on 30 June, by the 4th Battalion The Lincolnshire Regiment (4th Lincolns). [...] and artillery fire fell on the 10th DLI and 4/7th Dragoon Guards south of Rauray during the day, where several tanks were lost while reconnoitring the forward slope. On 30 June, the two Durham battalions were relieved at Rauray by the Tyneside Scottish, which sent patrols forward in the evening.|$|E

2500|$|There {{was only}} time for two overs before stumps and Brian Statham made the ball lift outside the off-stump, {{which might have}} {{produced}} a wicket given another quarter of an hour, but Colin McDonald and Jim Burke survived the day on 8/0. The first day had produced only 142 runs and although the Saturday <b>was</b> <b>bright</b> <b>and</b> clear and good for batting, only 148 runs were made as an excellent England bowling attack regained the initiative and the Australian batsmen eked out the runs. Burke edged a catch to gully, but Trevor Bailey was too deep to catch it and after a slow start—and much to everybody's surprise—he peeled off a couple of cover-drives off Peter Loader. Loader was repeatedly no-balled {{and was replaced by}} Bailey and the openers took their partnership past fifty when the sightsreen was laboriously moved and Loader returned round the wicket to have Burke caught behind for 20. The teams went off for lunch at the fall of the wicket and returned on 55/1 with Neil Harvey coming in instead of Ken Mackay as announced by the scoreboard, indicating that Benaud wanted the runs to flow. Bailey had McDonald caught in slip for 42 in two hours and Norm O'Neill (who had not broken his finger as first thought) came in with the hopes of Australia hanging on his shoulders. May set a defensive field to limit his runmaking, but he hit his first ball for four before the runs dried up and he was outpaced by [...] "Slasher" [...] Mackay. Loader (4/56 with 19 no balls) caught Harvey l.b.w. after he had spent an hour making 14. Bailey (3/35) accounted for the out of form Peter Burge and had O'Neill was caught by a spectacular diving catch by Tom Graveney for 34 in 151 minutes, Jim Laker (2/15) had Mackay (16) caught behind, much to his displeasure and Australia ended the day on 156/6, 22 runs ahead. After the rest day Australia did not long survive the fall of Benaud (16) on the Monday morning, l.b.w. to Loader and the tail collapsed to 186 all out despite the best efforts of Alan Davidson (25), last man out to Laker.|$|E
