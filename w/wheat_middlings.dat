This study looks at the use of okara, a waste product from the production of tofu and soymilk, as a protein supplement for lactating ewes. In a replicated four-by-four Latin square trial, eight ewes and their twin lambs were fed four different diets. The four diets were: Diet A, a <b>wheat</b> <b>middling</b> and corn concentrate fed with a mixed grass hay; Diet B, an okara and corn concentrate fed with mixed grass hay; Diet C, a soybean meal and <b>wheat</b> <b>middling</b> concentrate fed with haylage; and Diet D an okara and corn concentrate fed with haylage. Ewe weights, lamb weights and daily feed intakes were recorded and milk samples were taken to determine the effect of the diets on the growth and feed intake of the animals and milk composition. The diets had no statistically significant impact on ewe or lamb growth, overall dry matter intake or growth efficiency, but there was significant difference in the amount of different diet forage and concentrate consumed. There was also no effect on milk composition, though there were some trends observed.

The second objective was to study the effects of Aspergillus oryzae (AFE) inclusion on nutrient utilization. Three ruminal fistulated dry dairy cows were used for rumen fluid and fifteen conventional forages used in dairy cattle were collected around this island. The degradability of these feedstuffs with and without AFE (Amaferm(R)) treatment was measured using the Daisy(R) in vitro method. The roughage energy values, including TDN and NEL, were calculated according to Robinson (2000). Results from the 30 h in vitro neutral detergent fiber (NDF) degradability and predicted energy evaluations showed that alfalfa (among the forages) contained the highest degradability and energy values, Bermuda straw having the lowest. Peanut vines and corn silage contained higher energy values and the lowest value found in Pangola and Napier grasses among the locally produced forages. Pangola and Napier grasses had lower values than most imported forages except Bermuda straw. Among the by-products, <b>wheat</b> <b>middling</b> contained the highest NDF degradability, while rice bran contained the richest energy value due to its high oil content.

40|$|Seis novilhos &frac 12; sangue Holandês-Zebu castrados, fistulados no rúmen e no abomaso, foram distribuídos em dois quadrados latinos 3 x 3 (três animais, três níveis de oferta - 1, 5; 2, 0 e 2, 5 % PV e três períodos) para determinar os consumos e as digestibilidades totais e parciais dos carboidratos totais (CHO), da fibra em detergente neutro (FDN) e dos carboidratos não-fibrosos (CNF). As digestibilidades foram determinadas com óxido crômico. Os consumos de CHO, FDN, CNF e NDT (kg/dia) e de CHO, FDN e CNF (% do peso vivo - PV) aumentaram linearmente com os níveis de oferta. O teste de identidade de modelos, realizado para as equações de regressão para as digestibilidades total, ruminal e intestinais dos CHO, em função dos níveis de oferta, indicou não existir diferenças entre as metodologias de coleta. As digestibilidades total, ruminal e intestinais dos CHO não foram influenciadas pelos tratamentos. A digestibilidade total da FDN diminuiu linearmente com o aumento dos níveis de oferta, enquanto as digestões ruminal e intestinais da FDN não foram influenciadas pelos tratamentos. Não foi observado efeito dos níveis de oferta para as digestibilidades totais dos CNF. Utilizando a metodologia de coleta de digesta no omaso, foi observado aumento linear da digestibilidade ruminal dos CNF. Quando foi usada a coleta no abomaso, não houve efeito do aumento do consumo sobre a digestão ruminal dos CNF. A coleta de digesta abomasal pode ser substituída pela coleta de digesta omasal, via fístula ruminal. A coleta de digesta omasal é vantajosa, tornando o estudo de digestão parcial um processo menos invasivo. Six half-bred &frac 12; Holstein-Zebu steers, fistulated in the rumen and abomasum, were {{randomly}} assigned to two 3 x 3 Latin squares (animal, ingestion regime - 1. 5, 2. 0 and 2. 5 % LW and period) to determine the intake and total and partial digestibility of total carbohydrates (CHO), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and non fiber carbohydrates (NFC). Chromic oxide was used as a marker to determine the digestibilities. Animals were fed diet with 60 % Tifton- 85 bermudagrass (Cynodon spp.) hay and 40 % concentrate mixture (corn starch, <b>wheat</b> <b>middling,</b> soybean meal, urea and minerals), were used. Intakes CHO, NDF, NFC and TDN (kg/day, %LW) linearly increased with the ingestion regimes. The identity model test, used to estimate the regression equations for the total, ruminal and intestinal digestibilities of CHO, in function of the ingestion regime, showed no differences among collection methods. Total, ruminal and intestinal carbohydrates digestibilities were not affected by the treatments. Neutral detergent fiber total digestibility linearly decreased as the ingestion regime increased, while NDF ruminal and intestinal digestibilities were not affected by the treatments. No effect of ingestion regime was observed for the NFC total digestibilities. A linear increase of NFC ruminal digestibility was observed by using the omasal method of digesta collection. When the abomasal method of digesta collection was used, no effect of increased intake on the NFC ruminal digestibility was observed. Abomasal method of digesta collection could be replaced by omasal method of digesta collection, by ruminal fistula. Omasal method of Digesta collection is an efficient method, becoming the study of partial digestion a less invasive process...|$|R

Effect of dietary level of maize silage Felicia Masucci 1, Carmela Maria Assunta Barone 1, Fabio Napolitano 2, Maria Luisa Varricchio 1, Antonio Zullo 1, Antonio Di Francia 1 1 Dipartimento di Scienze del Suolo, della Pianta, dell’Ambiente e delle Produzioni Animali Università di Napoli Federico II, Italy 2 Dipartimento di Scienze delle Produzioni Animali, Università della Basilicata, Potenza, Italy Corresponding author: felicia. masucci@unina. it Aim {{of this study}} was to evaluate growth {{performance and}} meat quality of buffalo bulls fed two diets with different maize silage contents. Compositions (kg/head/d) of low (LS) and high silage diets (HS) were the following: maize silage 3. 0 vs 10. 5; alfalfa hay 0 vs 2. 0; barley 0. 25 vs 0. 75; <b>wheat</b> flour <b>middlings</b> 1. 0 vs 1. 0; wheat straw 3. 0 vs 0; commercial concentrate for lactating buffalo cows 0 vs 2. 5; commercial concentrate for young buffalo bulls 4. 5 vs 0. The diets were approximately isoenergetic [0. 92 vs 0. 91 Milk FU/kg dry matter (DM) ] and isonitrogenous (14. 7 vs 14. 7 CP% DM). Fourteen young buffalo bulls (316 ± 70 days of age and 436 ± 67 kglive weight) were assigned into the two dietary groups. Average daily gain (ADG) was calculated every 2 weeks, along with DM intake (DMI), calculated on pen basis. On a subgroup of 4 individuals per groups, carcass traits were recorded at slaughter. Meat quality (hardness, cohesion, chewiness, WB shear force) and meat colour (L*, a*, b*) were evaluated on 7 -day aged muscles (Longissimus dorsi, Semitendinosus, Semimembranosus). DMI and carcass traits were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. ADG and meat quality parameters were analyzed by a linear mixed model for repeated measures. No differences were observed for diet DMI (8. 41 vs 8. 64 kg DM/day for LS and HS diets, respectively; SE 0. 44), as a consequence ADG did not differ between the groups (0. 92 vs 0. 89 kg/day; SE 0. 04). All carcasses had the same carcass conformation (O) and fatness (4) scores. No differences were observed for carcass traits (carcass weight 250 vs 249 kg; SE 8. 13; dressing percentages 52. 1 vs 50. 6 %; SE 1. 1) and any meat quality parameters. Therefore, maize silage can be either used as the primary source of roughage or in combination with other forages without affecting growth performance and meat quality...|$|R

Pens of pigs were randomly allotted by initial weight and gender (4 barrows and 4 gilts per pen) to 1 of 6 dietary treatments with 6 replications per treatment. Treatments were arranged in a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement with the main effects of added <b>wheat</b> <b>middlings</b> (0 or 20 %) and CWG (0, 2. 5, or 5 %). Dietary treatments were corn-soybean meal-based diets with 15 % dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) and fed in 4 phases. There were no CWG x <b>wheat</b> <b>middlings</b> interactions (P ≥ 0. 12) for any of the criteria evaluated. Overall, (d 0 to 87) adding 20 % dietary <b>wheat</b> <b>middlings</b> decreased (P < 0. 001) ADG and worsened (P < 0. 001) F/G. Pigs fed diets with increased dietary CWG had increased (quadratic, P < 0. 03) ADG and improved (linear, P < 0. 01) F/G. Pigs fed diets containing 20 % <b>wheat</b> <b>middlings</b> had decreased (P < 0. 01) final BW; while there was a numerical increase in final BW (P < 0. 09) as dietary fat was increased. For carcass traits, pigs fed <b>wheat</b> <b>middlings</b> had decreased percentage yield (P < 0. 04), HCW (P < 0. 003), backfat depth (P < 0. 04), and loin depth (P < 0. 001), while jowl iodine value increased (P < 0. 001). Additionally, pigs fed added fat had a tendency for increased backfat depth (linear; P < 0. 06) and had a linear increase (P < 0. 01) in jowl iodine value. For economics, adding 20 % <b>wheat</b> <b>middlings</b> to the diet decreased (P < 0. 001) feed cost per pig and feed cost per lb gain; however, total revenue was also reduced (P < 0. 003), resulting in a numeric decrease (P = 0. 13) in income over feed cost (IOFC). Adding CWG increased (linear; P < 0. 001) feed cost per pig and feed cost per lb gain, but only numerically increased (P = 0. 12) total revenue, leading to a tendency for decreased IOFC (linear; P < 0. 09), with increasing amounts of CWG. Therefore, <b>wheat</b> <b>middlings</b> can be used as an alternative ingredient in swine diets to decrease feed cost and feed cost per lb of gain, but in this study the reduced performance resulted in less revenue and lower profitability...|$|E
40|$|Swine Industry Day, 2014 {{is known}} as Swine Day, 2014 A total of 288 pigs (PIC 327 × 1050, {{initially}} 107. 0 lb BW) were used in an 87 -d trial {{to determine the effects}} of diet form and corn oil on growth performance, carcass yield, and iodine value (IV) of growing-finishing pigs. Treatments were arranged in a 2 × 3 factorial with the main effects of diet form and oil source. The 2 diet forms were meal or pellet. The 3 dietary formulations were: (1) corn-soybean meal–based control, (2) control with 30 % dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) and 19 % <b>wheat</b> <b>middlings,</b> and (3) control with 3 % corn oil. No diet form × diet formulation interactions were observed for growth performance, HCW, or carcass yield. Overall (d 0 to 87), pigs fed pelleted diets had increased (P < 0. 05) ADG, decreased (P < 0. 05) ADFI, and improved (P < 0. 05) F/G compared with pigs fed meal diets. Diet form did not influence HCW or carcass yield. Pigs fed diets containing DDGS and <b>wheat</b> <b>middlings</b> had decreased (P < 0. 05) ADG compared with pigs fed the control or corn oil diets. Feeding the corn oil diet resulted in decreased (P < 0. 05) ADFI compared with pigs fed the diet with DDGS and <b>wheat</b> <b>middlings,</b> with pigs fed the control diet intermediate. Feed efficiency followed dietary energy, with pigs fed the corn oil diet having the best (P < 0. 05) F/G, pigs fed DDGS and <b>wheat</b> <b>middlings</b> diet having the worst, and pigs fed the control intermediate. Pigs fed the diet with DDGS and <b>wheat</b> <b>middlings</b> had decreased (P < 0. 05) HCW and carcass yield compared with pigs fed the control or corn oil treatments. No interaction was detected between diet form and oil source for belly fat IV. Pigs fed pelleted diets had increased (P < 0. 05) belly fat IV compared with those fed meal diets, regardless of diet formulation. Belly fat IV was greatest (P < 0. 05) for pigs fed DDGS and <b>wheat</b> <b>middlings,</b> lowest for pigs fed the control, and intermediate for pigs fed the corn oil diets. An interactive effect between diet form and oil source was detected (P < 0. 05) for shoulder fat IV, caused by an increase in shoulder fat IV from feeding pelleted diets for the control or corn oil treatments. Thus, with the exception of the lack of increase in IV in pigs fed the pelleted DDGS and <b>wheat</b> <b>middlings</b> diet, feeding pelleted diets increased carcass fat IV. Furthermore, we found no evidence that the source of fat (endogenous vs. supplemental) in pelleted diets affected the IV response to pelleting...|$|E
40|$|MIXED grain rations {{including}} wheat, oat {{and corn}} products have been {{popular in the}} Mid-West for some time. However when certain of these feeds are included in large quantity in chick rations a reduced growth rate has often resulted. Heuser et al. (1945) have shown a reduced, growth rate and decreased efficiency from the feeding of high fiber rations. Some of these rations contained bran and middlings. Mishler et al. (1946) found that when 10 percent each of wheat bran and standard <b>wheat</b> <b>middlings</b> re-placed corn in a simplified corn and soy-bean oil meal ration, growth was retarded and more feed was required per unit of gain. Carrick and Roberts (1947) noted that when 10 percent each of wheat bran and <b>wheat</b> <b>middlings</b> replaced 20 percent ground yellow corn in a ration known to give rapid growth, feed efficiency and rate of growth decreased.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify a suitable alternative to the current practice of complementing the feeding of milk by-products with straw. The influence of 5 different types of solid feeds on health and performance of Swiss veal calves was investigated in 2 production cycles of 200 veal calves each with a mean initial age of 40 days (d). The calves were housed in groups of 40 in stalls with outside pen. Liquid feeding consisted of a milk by-product combined with an additional skim milk powder ad libitum. Groups were assigned to 1 of the 5 following experimental solid feeds provided ad libitum: mix (composition: soy flakes, corn, barley, <b>wheat,</b> oat, barley <b>middling,</b> plant oil, molasses), whole plant corn pellets, corn silage, hay, and wheat straw as control. Daily dry matter intake per calf averaged 2. 25 kg of the liquid food, 0. 16 kg of straw, 0. 33 kg of mix, 0. 47 kg of corn silage, 0. 38 kg of corn pellets, and 0. 39 kg of hay. No significant differences (P > 0. 05) among groups were found in calf losses that amounted to 4. 8 % (68 % because of gastrointestinal disorders). Four percent of the calves were slaughtered prematurely. Daily doses of antibiotics were higher in the mix (36. 9 d, P 0. 1). The duration of the fattening period averaged 114 d, slaughter age 157 d, and carcass weight 122 kg. The average daily weight gain (ADG) was highest in the control group straw (1. 35 kg), and lowest in the hay group (1. 22 kg, P 0. 1) : 73 % of the carcasses were assessed as pale (267 / 364), 18 % as pink (66 / 364), and 9 % (31 / 364) as red. The results reveal that whole-plant corn pellets are most consistent with an optimal result combining the calves' health and fattening performance. Therefore, it can be recommended as an additional solid feed for veal calves under Swiss conditions...|$|R
