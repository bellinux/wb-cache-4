Berryman also added, [...] "It becomes its own thing, kind of like points of inspiration that kind of lead you down certain paths. <b>Whenever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to write a song like someone else, it ultimately ends up sounding like something different anyway." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bands {{like the}} Grateful Dead, Big Brother and the Holding Company (with Janis Joplin), and Jefferson Airplane {{continued}} {{to live in the}} Haight, {{but by the end of}} the summer, the incessant media coverage led the Diggers to declare the [...] "death" [...] of the hippie with a parade. [...] According to the late poet Stormi Chambless, the hippies buried an effigy of a hippie in the Panhandle to demonstrate the end of his/her reign. [...] Regarding this period of history, the July 7, 1967, TIME magazine featured a cover story entitled, [...] "The Hippies: The Philosophy of a Subculture." [...] The article described the guidelines of the hippie code: [...] "Do your own thing, wherever you have to do it and <b>whenever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want.</b> [...] Drop out. [...] Leave society as you have known it. [...] Leave it utterly. [...] Blow the mind of every straight person you can reach. [...] Turn them on, if not to drugs, then to beauty, love, honesty, fun." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 1967, Herb Caen was {{approached}} by [...] "a distinguished magazine" [...] to write about why hippies were attracted to San Francisco. He declined the assignment but interviewed hippies in the Haight for his own newspaper column in the San Francisco Chronicle. Caen determined that, [...] "Except in their music, they couldn't care less about {{the approval of the}} straight world." [...] Caen himself felt that the city of San Francisco was so straight that it provided a visible contrast with hippie culture. On July 7, Time magazine featured a cover story entitled, [...] "The Hippies: The Philosophy of a Subculture." [...] The article described the guidelines of the hippie code: [...] "Do your own thing, wherever {{you have to do it}} and <b>whenever</b> <b>you</b> <b>want.</b> Drop out. Leave society as you have known it. Leave it utterly. Blow the mind of every straight person you can reach. Turn them on, if not to drugs, then to beauty, love, honesty, fun." [...] It is estimated that around 100,000 people traveled to San Francisco in the summer of 1967. The media was right behind them, casting a spotlight on the Haight-Ashbury district and popularizing the [...] "hippie" [...] label. With this increased attention, hippies found support for their ideals of love and peace but were also criticized for their anti-work, pro-drug, and permissive ethos.|$|E

6000|$|We {{have had}} great fun over a clock that an unknown admirer sent papa last Thursday. It {{arrived in a}} wooden box from London, {{carriage}} paid, and papa feels {{it must have been}} sent by some one who had read his remarkable sermon, 'Is Licence Liberty?' for {{on the top of the}} clock was a figure of a woman, with what papa said was the cap of Liberty on her head. I didn't think it very becoming myself, but papa said it was historical, so I suppose it is all right. Parker unpacked it, and papa put it on the mantelpiece in the library, and we were all sitting there on Friday morning, when just as the clock struck twelve, we heard a whirring noise, a little puff of smoke came from the pedestal of the figure, and the goddess of Liberty fell off, and broke her nose on the fender! Maria was quite alarmed, but it looked so ridiculous, that James and I went off into fits of laughter, and even papa was amused. When we examined it, we found it was a sort of alarum clock, and that, if you set it to a particular hour, and put some gunpowder and a cap under a little hammer, it went off <b>whenever</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted.</b> Papa said it must not remain in the library, as it made a noise, so Reggie carried it away to the schoolroom, and does nothing but have small explosions all day long. Do you think Arthur would like one for a wedding present? I suppose they are quite fashionable in London. Papa says they should do a great deal of good, as they show that Liberty can't last, but must fall down. Papa says Liberty was invented at the time of the French Revolution. How awful it seems! ...|$|R

6000|$|Imagine {{the artistic}} nursery {{five minutes after}} the real child had been let loose in it. I know a lady who once spent {{hundreds}} of pounds on an artistic nursery. She showed it to her friends with pride. The children were allowed in there on Sunday afternoons. I did an equally silly thing myself not long ago. Lured by a furniture catalogue, I started Robina in a boudoir. I {{gave it to her}} as a birthday-present. We have both regretted it ever since. Robina reckons she could have had a bicycle, a diamond bracelet, and a mandoline, and I should have saved money. I did the thing well. I told the furniture people I wanted it just as it stood in the picture: [...] "Design for bedroom and boudoir combined, suitable for young girl, in teak, with sparrow blue hangings." [...] We had everything: the antique fire arrangements that a vestal virgin might possibly have understood; the candlesticks, that were pictures in themselves, until we tried to put candles in them; the book-case and writing-desk combined, that wasn't big enough to write on, and out of which it was impossible to get a book until you had abandoned the idea of writing and had closed the cover; the enclosed washstand, that shut down and looked like an old bureau, with the inevitable bowl of flowers upon it that had to be taken off and put on the floor <b>whenever</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> to use the thing as a washstand; the toilet-table, with its cunning little glass, just big enough to see your nose in; the bedstead, hidden away behind the [...] "thinking corner," [...] where the girl couldn't get at it to make it. A prettier room you could not have imagined, till Robina started sleeping in it. I think she tried. Girl friends of hers, to whom she had bragged about it, would drop in and ask to be allowed to see it. Robina would say, [...] "Wait a minute," [...] and would run up and slam the door; and we would hear her for the next half-hour or so rushing round opening and shutting drawers and dragging things about. By the time it was a boudoir again she was exhausted and irritable. She wants now to give it up to Veronica, but Veronica objects to the position, which is between the bathroom and my study. Her idea is a room more removed, where {{she would be able to}} shut herself in and do her work, as she explains, without fear of interruption.|$|R
