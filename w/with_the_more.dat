5|$|Although {{none were}} ever built, several {{derivatives}} of Black Arrow were also proposed, as ways of increasing its payload capacity. One proposal added eight Raven solid rocket motors from the Skylark programme {{to the first}} stage as booster rockets.

This result has been recovered by the phylogenies of Benson et al., who have also noted a number of morphological traits which ally Brancasaurus <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> general Leptocleidia.|$|E
5|$|Cheap {{gasoline}} encouraged automobile ownership, {{which provided}} a substantial revenue source to the government, {{leading to the}} rapid expansion of highway development.

Melting in an electric arc furnace can be used to produce small ingots of the metal without the need for a crucible.|$|E

5|$|The British {{educational}} policies segregating {{the different}} races — providing minimal public education for Malays, and leaving non-Malays {{to their own}} devices — did not help matters. The Malays, predominantly rural-dwellers, were not encouraged to socialise <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> urban non-Malays. The economic impoverishment of the Malays which set them apart from the better-off Chinese also fanned racial sentiments.|$|E

5|$|The {{design for}} Stars was likely {{influenced}} by Escher's own interest in both geometry and astronomy, {{by a long}} history of using geometric forms to model the heavens, and by a drawing style used by Leonardo da Vinci.
