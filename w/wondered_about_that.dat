50|$|I've <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> This {{is going}} to sound bizarre to most people, but ALL {{inspiration}} comes from something similar to the way a radio works. If you imagine that everything ever known or will be known exists between the lowest and the highest frequencies, we simply either stumble upon a brilliant song accidentally, or we spend our lives searching for great songs and find them where we may. Invention works like that. I think Tesla said something to that effect: We are simply filters for Divine Knowledge.|$|E
5000|$|Kierkegaard [...] "felt {{inclined}} to doubt a little the correctness {{of the familiar}} philosophic maxim that the external is the internal and the internal the external and was always heretically-minded on this point in philosophy." [...] The external would be experience and the internal revelation. [...] This developed into the discussions about the primacy of Revelation or of Reason in religious matters. At this time a new medium for knowledge was coming of age, newspapers. Kierkegaard wrote about them on November 28, 1835. These newspapers came {{to be regarded as}} another form of knowledge. But is this knowledge given by the newspapers an external or an internal form of knowledge or of revelation? Kierkegaard <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E

[...] On the aired clip, Haraldsen cannot refrain from smiling as Oddo starts swearing at and threatening the film crew. One of the film crew's cameras continues recording the incident, as Oddo, in a profanity-laced tirade, furiously tells them to get [...] "the fuck" [...] out of his office. Oddo later apologized, stating the tirade was [...] "inappropriate" [...] but that the sentiment beneath it was entirely appropriate.|$|E

40|$|The stage {{presents}} {{things that}} are make-believe; presumably real life presents {{things that are}} real and sometimes not well-rehearsed’ (Goffman, E. 1959, preface). As a student nurse, one quickly learns two strategies when caring for individuals with severe dementia. At moments when the disease creates a sense of confusion and subsequent distress, one choice is to attempt re-orientation, to facilitate the person’s reconnection with their present place and time. Another strategy is {{to engage in the}} world experienced only by that individual in that moment, to become their sister, their childhood friend, their mother, choosing to characterise a person seen only by the individual living with dementia. I have often <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> choice, to agree to play a part in a reality withheld from me, a reality only accessible to and accessed by the person in my care. How, instinctively, did I grow to recognise when to re-orientate and when to become the other character in the ‘scene’ and why did that decision, often taken in the spur of the moment, prevent distress, agitation and, at times, aggression? As a theatre scholar, I now question the decision to perform in a different light and in relation to current trends in the care of individuals with dementia that formally adopt a level of performance. As a case study, I will explore Hogewey, a residential care home in Holland that embraces a unique practice, creating an entire world for its residents, remote from the rest of society, in an attempt to, as some nursing scholars suggest, minimise disability and maximise ‘wellbeing by providing a physical and social environment congruent with people’s lifestyles’ (Jenkins C and Smythe, A. 2013, p. 14). I introduce Hogewey not to highlight its uniqueness, but to explore the potentiality of a conscious decision to avoid reorientation in favor of the alternative, to engage with rather than deny the many alternative realities produced {{in the mind of the}} individual with dementia.

I <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> {{it as much as}} I regret it. Still, it is true that Hitler betrayed me. I had an audience with him, {{as a representative of the}} Protestant Church, shortly before he became Chancellor, in 1932. Hitler promised me on his word of honor, to protect the Church, and not to issue any anti-Church laws. He also agreed not to allow pogroms against the Jews, assuring me as follows: [...] "There will be restrictions against the Jews, but there will be no ghettos, no pogroms, in Germany." [...] I really believed, given the widespread anti-Semitism in Germany, at that time—that Jews should avoid aspiring to Government positions or seats in the Reichstag. There were many Jews, especially among the Zionists, who took a similar stand. Hitler's assurance satisfied me at the time. On the other hand, I hated the growing atheistic movement, which was fostered and promoted by the Social Democrats and the Communists. Their hostility toward the Church made me pin my hopes on Hitler for a while. [...] I am paying for that mistake now; and not me alone, but thousands of other persons like me.|$|R

40|$|Last week I {{went to a}} talk {{where the}} speaker, a {{well-known}} software technologist, made the assertion that Software Engineering is still an immature discipline. I started to <b>wonder</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> as I {{looked around the room}} and saw a bunch of typical compu-geeks with funny looking hair, dirty jeans and sloppy T-shirts. Maybe, I thought, it is not Software Engineering that is immature, but Software Engineers! Now that’s a thought that might bear some examination. Suppose we think about other sorts of engineering: electrical, civil and so forth. These engineers build concrete products using well-defined disciplines, and following well-known building or electrical regulations. But software engineers don’t build anything very concrete. How many programmers does it take to screw in a light bulb? None! That’s a hardware problem. Engineers have disciplines. They wear white shirts, work regular daytime hours and are rewarded for designing and constructing real things. Programmers (whom I assume are the same thing as software engineers) make it a point to keep weird hours, play loud music and wear nontraditional garb whenever they can. Bridges, buildings, circuit boards and chips work mostly as designed. But software doesn’t work very well. It frequently presents a quirky, idiosyncrati...|$|R

40|$|Reading these essays {{has shown}} {{me a great}} deal, both about the {{substantive}} issues I have dealt with and {{about how to do}} philosophy. On the former front, they show that I have missed some points and overstated others, and sometimes just been unable to penetrate the fog. On the latter front, they show {{how hard it is to}} write philosophy that works [...] and this is the point that stands out for me as I reflect on these rich and varied essays. Philosophical books and articles routinely fail to achieve their manifest goal of persuading their intended audiences of their main points. Does this make philosophy any worse off than other writing endeavors? Most published novels are failures of one sort or another, and the press has reported a recent study (whose methodology I <b>wonder</b> <b>about)</b> <b>that</b> concludes that the median number of readers of any paper published in a psychology journal is zero. But it seems to me that philosophy displays a particularly feckless record, with such a huge gap between authorial pretense and effect achieved that it is perhaps more comic than pathetic. In one weak moment I found myself thinking that perhaps some of our French colleagues have the right idea: deliberate obscurantism and the striking of stylized poses [...] since the goal of persuading by clear, precise analysis and argument is so manifestly beyond us. But that worldly weariness passed, I'm happy to say, and my cock-eyed American optimism returned. My ambition continues to be to change people's minds, and not just to win people over to my way of doing philosophy, as Bo Dahlbom suggests. But I admit that it is harder than I had thought. It's hard enough to get a good idea, but sometimes it's even harder, apparently, to get others to see what the idea is, and why it's good...|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the discoverer of Antioch <b>wondered</b> <b>about</b> the sanctuary <b>that</b> Strabo mentions in his Geography, and Ramsay's team found a sacred prosessional road with votive steles on either side leading up to the sanctuary.

50|$|It is very {{difficult}} to accurately detect, verify, or track the data that would be needed to test these hypotheses. Short of any outright auditing (which has no legally justifiable basis), firms have a fair amount of plausible deniability.

40|$|During {{the latter}} half of the 1990 s, {{productivity}} grew at almost twice the pace of the preceding ten years.

Productivity growth slowed sharply in the early 1970 s (and stayed low for several decades), while unemployment increased noticeably.

60|$|It {{is a most}} {{successful}} method of fishing, while its nature is more that of an outing festival, rather than of a prosaic, food-getting task. Such fishing parties take place {{about once a month}} at Bora Bora, and it is a custom that has descended from old time. The man who originated it is not remembered. They always did this thing. But one cannot help <b>wondering</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> forgotten savage of the long ago, into whose mind first flashed this scheme of easy fishing, of catching huge quantities of fish without hook, or net, or spear. One thing about him we can know: he was a radical. And we can be sure that he was considered feather-brained and anarchistic by his conservative tribesmen. His difficulty was much greater than that of the modern inventor, who has to convince in advance only one or two capitalists. That early inventor had to convince his whole tribe in advance, for without the co-operation of the whole tribe the device could not be tested. One can well imagine the nightly pow-wow-ings in that primitive island world, when he called his comrades antiquated moss-backs, and they called him a fool, a freak, and a crank, and charged him with having come from Kansas. Heaven alone knows at what cost of grey hairs and expletives he must finally have succeeded in winning over a sufficient number to give his idea a trial. At any rate, the experiment succeeded. It stood the test of truth--it worked! And thereafter, we can be confident, there was no man to be found who did not know all along {{that it was going to}} work.|$|R
