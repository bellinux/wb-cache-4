5|$|In 1895 Bain first played {{competitive}} {{ice hockey}} when he answered a classified ad {{placed in a}} newspaper by the Winnipeg Victorias, who were looking for new players. Though he played with a broken stick held together by wire, Bain made the team only five minutes into the tryout. Bain quickly became a star centre and leader for the Victorias. This was proven during a February 14, 1896 game against the Montreal Victorias for the Stanley Cup, the trophy for the national hockey championship in Canada. It was a 2–0 victory for Winnipeg that gave them the Cup. This victory {{marked the first time}} a team outside of Quebec had won the trophy. The team was greeted by a huge crowd at the Canadian Pacific Railway station when their train, decorated with hockey sticks and the Union Jack, returned to Winnipeg. They <b>were</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> a feast in their honour in a parade of open sleighs, where fans gathered to celebrate the championship.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Sarah and Casey {{learn that}} Ned is {{unmarried}} and had earlier called Mauser {{rather than his}} wife, as the hostages <b>were</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> believe. They follow the ambulance containing Chuck and Mauser and shoot its tires, sending the vehicle into a Christmas tree lot and allowing Chuck to escape. After a brief fight, Mauser surrenders, confident that Fulcrum will rescue him. To protect Chuck, Sarah executes Mauser. Unknown to Sarah, Chuck watches the entire confrontation in horror from afar. She lies to Chuck and tells him that Mauser has been arrested. At the Buy More, Ellie and Morgan's girlfriend Anna Wu (Julia Ling) praise Lester for his act of bravery. Morgan watches as Lester grabs Anna and kisses her, turning away before Anna pulls away from Lester in disgust. The episode closes with both Morgan and Chuck heartbroken, Morgan believing Anna to be unfaithful, and Chuck believing Sarah to be a murderer.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} Venizelists {{during the}} battle has been {{intensely}} contested by witnesses and historians. Vice admiral Louis Dartige du Fournet wrote that Venizelists supported the Allies and attacked passing Greek royalist army units. Venizelists participation was allegedly so extensive, that lead Admiral du Fourne wrote in his report {{that he had been}} involved in a civil war. The Venizelists continued fighting after the evacuation of the Allied marines until the next day, when they capitulated. The royalists claimed that large caches of weapons and ammunition were found in their strongholds packed in French military containers. Venizelists <b>were</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> prison surrounded by a furious mob and supposedly only the royal army escorts saved them from being murdered by the angry citizens. Other historians deny that the Venizelists collaborated with the Allied forces: Pavlos Karolidis, a contemporary royalist historian, argues that no Venizelist attacked their fellow citizens and the only weapons found during the raids on prominent Venizelists' houses were knives.|$|E

5|$|When Mauser enters, Chuck flashes on his watch, {{identifying}} {{him as a}} Fulcrum agent. Mauser tells Chuck that {{he knows}} that Casey and Sarah are CIA {{and that they are}} protecting an unknown asset. He reveals that Ned is a Fulcrum agent who caused the disturbance so Mauser could infiltrate the Buy More. At this point, it is revealed that Ned is far more competent than the hostages <b>were</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> believe, having intentionally shot Casey in the foot and separated Chuck from his handlers. Mauser threatens to shoot the hostages if Chuck does not reveal where Bryce Larkin and the government database the Intersect are. Chuck reveals to Mauser that the Intersect has been uploaded to his brain.|$|E
5|$|In mid-April, Armbrust rockets {{were fired}} from Croatian {{positions}} outside Borovo Selo into the village. According to {{one version of}} the event, several rounds were fired at agricultural machinery that served as barricades in the outskirts of Borovo Selo. According to a second version, three rockets were fired on the village with the specific aim of inflaming ethnic tensions. One of the rockets hit a house and another landed in a field, failing to explode. There were no casualties, but the already tense situation was made worse when the unexploded rocket was shown on Serbian Television as evidence of Croatian aggression against Serbs. The rockets were fired {{by a group of}} men that <b>were</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> the site by Osijek police chief Josip Reihl-Kir, who was later murdered by Croat irregulars. Croatia's interior minister Josip Boljkovac said the group included Deputy Defence Minister Gojko Šušak, Branimir Glavaš and Vice Vukojević. Šušak claimed {{he had nothing to do}} with the incident but had been in the area at the time. Nikola Jaman, at the time a commander of the local Police Reserve unit, said that he led the action and denied that Šušak, Glavaš and Vukojević were in the group. Jaman noted that the action was planned together with Reihl-Kir.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{enjoyed a}} run of success {{over the next several}} years. Led by league MVP quarterback Charlie Conerly, who passed for 1,706yards, 14 touchdowns, and four interceptions, they {{finished}} 9–3 in 1959 and faced the Colts in a championship game rematch. They lost again, this time in a far less dramatic game, 31–16. Conerly struggled with age and injuries in 1960, and was replaced by George Shaw. Gifford was concussed in a vicious hit by Chuck Bednarik during a November game versus the Philadelphia Eagles, and missed the rest of the season, and the following season, as a result. The hit was so devastating, that after being taken to the locker room, Gifford was given his last rites. The team still finished with a winning record at 6–4–2, but <b>were</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> acquire former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Y. A. Tittle in the offseason. Led by Tittle and new head coach Allie Sherman, New York won three consecutive Eastern Division titles from 1961 to 1963. In 1961, they were beaten by the Packers, 37–0 in the championship game. In 1962, they went into the championship game with a 12–2 record, and a nine-game winning streak; but lost to the Packers again, 16–7. Nonetheless, the Giants had captivated New York by this time, even though the sold out game was played in single-digit weather with 35mph winds, only 299 of the 65,000+ fans who bought tickets stayed home. Before the 1962 season, Gifford came out of his injury-forced retirement, saying he missed the game too much. He changed positions from halfback to flanker. During the season, Tittle and wide receiver Del Shofner set still-standing team records when Tittle threw for seven touchdowns and Shofner amassed 269 receiving yards in the same game on October 28. After the season, the team traded two-time Pro Bowl defensive lineman Roosevelt Grier to the Los Angeles Rams at his request; Grier wanted to move to LA to start his singing career.|$|E

5|$|With {{production}} terminated in October due to {{the evacuation}} of the factory, the number of available Pe-3s could not sustain as many units and many began to convert to other aircraft or roles. The 40th Fast Bomber Aviation Regiment was re-designated as the 40th Separate Long-range Reconnaissance Aviation Regiment on 15 December and mustered five Pe-3s on 1 May 1942 and eleven Pe-3s on 1 January 1943. The 9th Bomber Aviation Regiment was directly assigned to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force {{at the end of}} November 1941 and received the additional task of leading groups of fighters and attack aircraft to their targets because their pilots could not navigate on their own. Over 2000 aircraft <b>were</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> their targets in this manner before the regiment was converted to other roles. The 54th Bomber Aviation Regiment appears to have been disbanded on or after 20 May 1942. The 208th Short-Range Bomber Regiment lost ten aircraft before it transferred its surviving pilots and aircraft to the 95th Fighter Aviation Regiment in mid-January 1942 and reformed on the Ilyushin Il-2. On 5 February 1942 the 511th Bomber Aviation Regiment was based at Tula and lost three of its eight Pe-3s on strength to a German air raid. It was disbanded in late March 1942 for lack of aircraft. The 95th Fighter Aviation Regiment was transferred on 1 March 1942 to the Air Force of the Northern Fleet where it performed convoy escort, ground attack and reconnaissance missions in support of the Fleet. It operated Pe-3s as late as the end of 1942 when some of its crews, which had just picked up new aircraft, were diverted to participate in the Battle of Stalingrad, although most of the 1942 production aircraft were given to the 2nd, 4th, and 40th Separate Long-Range Reconnaissance Regiments.|$|E
