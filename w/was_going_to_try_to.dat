500|$|That evening, {{the patrol}} was {{attacked}} {{by a group of}} at least 60 insurgents, who had established two positions on a wooded ridge about 50 yards above the patrol and attempted to outflank Monti and his team. The Americans took cover and returned fire, and Monti radioed for artillery and close air support. [...] Enemy fire killed Staff Sergeant Patrick Lybert. Another Soldier, Specialist Brian J. Bradbury, was severely wounded and left lying in the open between the enemy and the team's position. Staff Sergeant Chris Cunningham, leader of the patrol's sniper team, called out that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> rescue Bradbury. Monti replied, [...] "That’s my guy. I am going to get him." ...|$|E
500|$|Davis {{received}} a tweet on June 30 from Michael Tran in Michigan asking {{him if he}} had ever used steroids. He responded [...] "No", that same day. Davis said later in an interview, [...] "I have not ever taken any PEDs. I'm not sure fans realize, we have the strictest drug testing in all of sports, even more than the Olympics. If anybody <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> cheat in our game, they couldn't. It's impossible to try to beat the system. Anyway, I've never taken PEDs, no. I wouldn't. Half the stuff on the list I can't even pronounce." [...] Later, Davis would say that he believed Roger Maris's 61 home run season was the true single-season home run record, due to the steroid scandal surrounding Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, and Mark McGwire.|$|E
500|$|In a 2010 Oprah interview, Presley {{admitted}} that they spent {{four years after the}} divorce [...] "getting back together and breaking up", until she felt she [...] "had to push it away." [...] She described the parallels between the lives of Jackson and her father Elvis, and said Jackson constantly asked her about the details of Elvis' death because he felt that he was [...] "going to end up the same way." [...] She had described such a conversation in a blog post the day after Jackson died, wherein she shared her feelings about his death. According to Presley, the last [...] "coherently good conversation" [...] she had with Jackson was in 2005. She said Jackson told her she had been right about certain people around him, whom she called [...] "vampires." [...] She replied that she was indifferent when he asked if she still loved him. [...] But Presley also said his death made her realize he loved her. She acknowledged his efforts in the relationship, saying, [...] "He honestly tried so hard and went through so much with me", but [...] "I didn’t appreciate it then and I wish I did." [...] At the end of the conversation, he reportedly told her [...] "he felt that someone <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> kill him {{to get a hold of}} his catalog and his estate" [...] and named some names she didn't want to say in the interview.|$|E

2500|$|And, I {{know the}} sense of {{helplessness}} that people feel. I know the urge to arm yourself, because that's what I did. I was trained in firearms. I'd walk to the hospital when my husband was sick. I carried a concealed weapon.

Before the fight with St-Pierre, Penn made a controversial comment that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> kill St-Pierre in the ring, but he later explained that he was speaking figuratively.|$|E

60|$|Although he was {{not willing}} to admit it to the others, Dave was greatly worried over the news brought by Tad Rason. Coupling it with what he had heard from Link Merwell and Nat Poole, he could reach but one conclusion, which was that in some way Ward Porton <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> prove that the boy from the Crumville poorhouse was not the real Dave Porter.|$|E

60|$|There was {{no doubt}} that Bob Atwood knew Reddy <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> induce Toby to help start a circus, and Bob knew, also, that Reddy and Toby would visit him, {{although}} he appeared very much surprised when he saw them coming up the hill towards his house. He was at home, evidently waiting for something, at an hour when all the other boys were out playing; and that, in itself, would have made Toby suspicious if he had {{paid much attention to}} the matter.|$|E

60|$|One thing Mr. Locker {{was firmly}} {{determined}} upon. He <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> see Olive {{as soon as}} it was possible before luncheon, and impress upon her the ardent nature of his feelings toward her; he did not believe he had done this yet. He looked about him. The party, excepting himself and Mr. Du Brant, were on the front lawn; he would join them and satirize the gloomy Austrian. If Olive could be made to laugh at him it would be like preparing a garden-bed with spade and rake before sowing his seeds.|$|E

She just slid {{into the middle of}} his remarks as a duck slides into the water, and then she began an oration. I really believe she did not know that any one else was talking." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{may have}} been rather to the credit of Mr. Schwirtz--it {{may have been}} a remnant of the clean pride which the boy Eddie Schwirtz must once have had, that, {{whenever}} she hinted that she would like to go back to work--he raged: [...] "So you think I can't support you, eh? My God!
