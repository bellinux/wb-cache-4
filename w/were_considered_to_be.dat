5|$|The British bands Seventh Angel and Detritus {{introduced}} Christian thrash metal to Europe. Seventh Angel <b>were</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thrash metal pioneers, {{and their}} albums achieved mainstream distribution through the Music for Nations label.

In the 1990s, New Mexico based Ultimatum and Oklahoman group called Eternal Decision gained some attention, the latter with its thrash and groove metal style. The 1997 album Eternal Decision hit the record stores in the U.S. and 16 other countries, achieving considerable acclaim and providing the band with even more notice.|$|E

5|$|Stelae <b>were</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{invested}} with holiness and, perhaps, even {{to contain a}} divine soul-like essence that almost made them living beings. Some were apparently given individual names in hieroglyphic texts and <b>were</b> <b>considered</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> participants in rituals conducted at their location. Such rituals in the Classic Period appear to have included a k'altun binding ritual, in which the stela was wrapped in bands of tied cloth. This ritual was {{closely tied to the}} k'atun-ending calendrical ceremony. A k'altun ritual is depicted carved onto a peccary skull deposited as a funerary offering at Copán, the scene shows two nobles flanking a stela-altar pair where the stela seems to have been bound with cloth. The act of wrapping or binding a sacred object was of considerable religious importance across Mesoamerica, and is well attested among the Maya right up to the present day. The precise meaning of the act is not clear, but may be to protect the bound object or to contain its sacred essence. The binding of stelae may be linked to the modern K'iche' Maya practice of wrapping small divinatory stones in a bundle.|$|E

5|$|The {{taking of}} black swans to Europe in the 18th and early 19th centuries brought the birds {{into contact with}} another aspect of European mythology: the {{attribution}} of sinister relationships between the devil and black-coloured animals, such as a black cat.

This may explain why black swans have never established a sizeable presence as feral animals in Europe or North America.|$|E
