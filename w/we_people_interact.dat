Previous research has examined the visual attention devoted to the 10 organic search results, and we extend this by also examining how gaze is distributed across other components of contemporary search engines, such as ads and related searches. This provides insights about searcher’s interactions with the “whole page”, and not just individual components. In addition, we used clustering techniques to identify groups of individuals, with distinct gaze patterns. The groups varied in how exhaustively they examined the search results and in what regions of the search result page they paid most attention to (organic results vs. ads). These results further {{our understanding of how}} attention is distributed across increasingly complex search result pages, and how individuals exhibit distinct patterns of attention and interaction.

40|$|Geography {{and social}} {{relationships}} are inextricably intertwined; the <b>people</b> <b>we</b> <b>interact</b> {{with on a}} daily basis almost always live near us. As people spend more time online, data regarding these two dimensions – geography and social relationships – are becoming increasingly precise, allowing us to build reliable models to describe their interaction. These models have important implications in the design of location-based services, security intrusion detection, and social media supporting local communities. Using user-supplied address data and the network of associations between members of the Facebook social network, we can directly observe and measure the relationship between geography and friendship. Using these measurements, we introduce an algorithm that predicts the location of an individual from a sparse set of located users with performance that exceeds IP-based geolocation. This algorithm is efficient and scalable, and could be run on hundreds of millions of users. Categories and Subject Descriptor...|$|R

Whenever possible, each of us takes full credit for everything good in this paper and blames the other for all errors and omissions. 1 Cooperation is difficult. Even {{if people want to}} treat each other fairly, collective dilemmas abound. Standard rationales for cooperation, such as small-group dynamics (Olson 1965), repeat play (Axelrod 1984), reciprocity (Boyd et al. 2003), do not apply to the kind of everyday cooperation <b>we</b> see where <b>people</b> <b>interact,</b> generally without conflict, with others whom they do not know and have no reason to expect to see again. As long as some people are willing to deviate from whatever behaviors are perceived as cooperative—that is, to cheat—cooperation cannot survive absent some enforcement mechanism. Cheaters are not necessarily “bad and ever ready to display their vicious nature, ” as Machiavelli (1940 [1531]) characterized people nearly 500 years ago, but they nonetheless take advantage of others who might prefer cooperation over competition and conflict. People can and clearly do cooperate, however; but how does cooperation survive in the face of pervasive self-interest and the concomitant ubiquity of collective dilemmas? One solution is government—centralized enforcement of generall...|$|R
40|$|The present article {{advances}} a joystick-based {{methodology for}} recording and studying time-dependent patterns as continuous phenomena. It is particularly useful for capturing moment-to-moment changes {{with regard to}} a state space defined by two orthogonal axes, as in studies involving the interpersonal circumplex or the mood circumplex. A joystick monitoring program (free, down-loadable, executable software available at www. wlu. ca/science/psadler) is used. While watching a recorded interaction displayed on the computer screen, an observer moves the joystick to indicate a target person’s moment-to-moment behavior, and the X–Y coordinates are written frequently (e. g., twice per second) to a data file. The authors describe the software {{and the nature of}} the data obtained. The authors also suggest possible applications, such as studying subtle patterns of inter-personal behavior during interactions and studying individual differences in the perception of moment-to-moment variations in a target person’s affect. Keywords momentary assessment, continuous assessment, continuous dynamics, real-time processing, com-puter software In psychology, many processes unfold over time, yielding variables with important time-dependent patterns.

40|$|<b>We</b> {{investigate}} how <b>people</b> <b>interact</b> with Web search engine result pages using eye-tracking. While {{previous research has}} focused on the visual attention devoted to the 10 organic search results, this paper examines other components of contemporary search engines, such as ads and related searches. We systematically varied the type of task (informational or navigational), the quality of the ads (relevant or irrelevant to the query), and the sequence in which ads of different quality were presented. We measured the effects of these variables on the distribution of visual attention and on task performance. Our results show significant effects of each variable. The amount of visual attention that people devote to organic results depends on both task type and ad quality. The amount of visual attention that people devote to ads depends on their quality, but not the type of task. Interestingly, the sequence and predictability of ad quality is also an important factor in determining how much people attend to ads. When the quality of ads varied randomly from task to task, people paid little attention to the ads, even when they were good. These results further our understanding of how attention devoted to search results is influenced by other page elements, and how previous search experiences influence how people attend to the current page...|$|R

40|$|Every week—on {{projects}} {{large and}} small—project managers analyze many situations and make tens, even hundreds, of decisions. Rarely, however, do they {{stop to think}} about how they think. No manager’s head contains a business, a project, people, resources, soft-ware, or hardware. All human decisions are based on models, usually mental models—of project roles and relationships, cost-schedule trade-offs, organi-zational structures, and so on—created out of each person’s prior experiences, training, and instruction (Hunt, 1989). These are the deeply ingrained assump-tions, generalizations, and even pictures and images we form of ourselves, others, the environment, and the things with which <b>we</b> <b>interact.</b> <b>People</b> base their models on whatever knowledge they have, real or imaginary, naïve or sophisticated (Norman, 1988, p. 38).

For example, Wallen {{emphasized the}} role of the receiver when communicating rather than just the sender, counter to most models of communication. As part of the model Wallen identified four key skills (Behavioral Specifics, Feeling Description, Perception Check and Paraphrase) that became the cornerstone of the T-group based experiential training developed by Wallen colleague Robert P. Crosby. According to Wallen’s Interpersonal Gap paper, “The most basic and recurring problems in social life stem from what you intend and the actual effect of your actions on others.” As described in the self-improvement book Fight, Flight, Freeze, “Wallen’s theory is that each of us has intentions in every interaction (we intend a certain impact), we translate (or encode) our intentions into words and actions, the <b>people</b> <b>we</b> are <b>interacting</b> with translate (decode) our words and actions, and the decoding determines the initial emotional impact on them,” as illustrated in the following graph: ...|$|R

40|$|Every day <b>we</b> {{encounter}} new <b>people,</b> <b>interact</b> with them, {{and form}} person impressions based on quick and automatic inferences from minimal contextual information. Previous studies have identified an extensive network of brain areas involved in familiar face recognition, {{but there is}} little evidence to date concerning the neural bases of negative vs. positive person impressions. In the present study, participants were repeatedly exposed to 16 unfamiliar face identities within a pseudo-interactive game context to generate a perception of either "friends" or "foes". Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was then performed during an old/new memory task to assess any difference in brain responses to these now familiar face identities, relative to unfamiliar faces. Importantly, whereas facial expressions were always emotional (either smiling or angry) during the encoding phase, they were always neutral during the memory task. Our results reveal that several brain regions involved in familiar face recognition, including fusiform cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, and amygdala, plus additional areas involved in motivational control such as caudate and anterior cingulate cortex, were differentially modulated as a function of a previous encounter, and generally more activated when faces were perceived as "foes" rather than "friends". These findings underscore that a key dimension of social judgments, based on past impressions of who may be supportive or hostile, may lead to long-lasting effects on memory for faces and thus influence affective reactions to people during a subsequent encounter even in a different (neutral) context...|$|R
