5|$|After the Second Punic War, {{there was}} a great {{increase}} in income inequality. While the middle class was drafted to serve in increasingly long campaigns, their farms and homesteads fell into bankruptcy. And with Rome's great military victories, vast numbers of slaves were imported into Italy. In the middle of the second century BC, the tribunate of Tiberius Gracchus led to a breakup of the long-standing norms of the republican constitution. Graccus' legislation effectively established a parallel administration challenging the socio-political power of the old aristocracy and establishing a precedent that the popular assemblies could vote themselves <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted.</b> His younger brother, Gaius Gracchus, further challenged the Senate's political preeminence, by threatening it with new judicial procedures. The Senate's violent reaction against both the Gracchi, which led to their deaths, also served to legitimise the use of violence for political ends.|$|E

25|$|Scorsese {{initially}} {{named the}} film Wise Guy and postponed making it; later, he and Pileggi {{changed the name}} to Goodfellas. To prepare for their roles in the film, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta often spoke with Pileggi, who shared research material left over from writing the book. According to Pesci, improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals wherein Scorsese gave the actors freedom to do <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted.</b> The director made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines he liked best, {{and put them into}} a revised script, which the cast worked from during principal photography.|$|E
25|$|While at Naco, Villa {{requested}} that several hundred of his wounded be trasported by rail through the United States to Juarez, Chiahuahua, as Carranza {{had been allowed}} to transport troops and supplies; that request was denied. After resting his troops at Naco, Villa gathered up the remainder of his forces and attacked the town of Hermosillo, Sonora, on November 21, 1915. In order to try to restore the morale of his troops, he promised them that after they took the city, they could do <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> with the town and its inhabitants. This actually ended up causing the attack to fail, as his men almost immediately turned to looting and rape rather than fighting, which allowed the defending forces to reorganize and drive the Villistas out.|$|E

500|$|Commencing {{with the}} [...] "Outside Broadcast" [...] leg, clips from the tour's [...] "video confessional booth" [...] were {{displayed}} on the set's screens between the main set and the encore. Concertgoers were encouraged to visit the booth prior to the concert and say <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted.</b> These [...] "confessions" [...] varied from a woman flashing her breasts to a man revealing he had killed his friend in a car accident. Once the encore began, Bono would return as a different alter ego—Mirror Ball Man in 1992, and MacPhisto in 1993. Performances of [...] "Desire" [...] were accompanied by images of Richard Nixon, Margaret Thatcher, Paul Gascoigne, and Jimmy Swaggart, and were meant as a criticism of greed; cash rained the stage and Bono portrayed Mirror Ball Man as {{an interpretation of the}} greedy preacher described in the song's lyrics. Bono often made a crank call from the stage as his persona of the time. Such calls included dialing a phone sex line, calling a taxi cab, ordering 10,000 pizzas (the Detroit pizza parlor delivered 100 pizzas during the show), or calling a local politician. Bono regularly called the White House in an attempt to contact President Bush. Though Bono never reached the President, Bush did acknowledge the calls during a press conference.|$|E
500|$|Madonna's first {{performance}} of [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] was on The MDNA Tour (2012) as the concert's opening track. The performance was choreographed by Jason Young and Alison Faulk, along with dancer Derrell Bullock, who assisted as supervisor. According to Faulk, Madonna asked Bullock {{to experiment with}} the concept of [...] "girl gone wild", {{and come up with a}} routine and style of his own. He wanted to find a story with the dancing and presented his moves to Madonna the next day. The singer also wanted to experiment {{with the concept of}} Catholic church, along with monks and gargoyles. Her message behind it was that of freedom, [...] "people getting to do <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to". Four dancers from Brooklyn, adept at bone breaking dance, were enlisted as backup crew for the performance. Young recalled that they could [...] "create these abstract, very animalistic shapes. What they can do with their arms is unbelievable. Anything that most people can do in front of their bodies, they do it behind their bodies." [...] The dancing required the boys to put on heels like Kazaky in the music video. Most of them refused to abide by it, resulting in Madonna giving them a choice to put the heels and dance or leave the show. The dancers complied and learned the choreography.|$|E
500|$|Although they {{initially}} {{worked well}} together, Simon and Groening's relationship became [...] "very contentious" [...] according to Groening. Simon never expected {{the show to}} be a success, often proclaiming to fellow staff members [...] "We're thirteen and out"—meaning that the show would be canceled after the thirteen episodes of the first season. Therefore, he also told the staff that they had creative freedom to do <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to make The Simpsons as good a show as possible, regardless of network or public opinion, {{because he thought it}} inevitably would not be renewed; he elaborated in 2009 that [...] "really I was saying that to take the pressure off of everyone. I was just saying let's just go out and make 13 episodes that are really good and really funny." [...] However, Groening interpreted it as meaning Simon was uncommitted and did not care whether the show was a success or not, as Simon's career would survive, whereas his own would not. In 2001, Groening described Simon as [...] "brilliantly funny and one of the smartest writers I've ever worked with, although unpleasant and mentally unbalanced." [...] According to John Ortved's book , when the show became successful Simon resented the media attention Groening received, particularly the praise for the show's writing; Simon felt that Groening's involvement was limited, and that he should have been the one receiving credit for the show. Simon later spoke well of Groening's influence, particularly on the show's positive tone.|$|E

500|$|When {{the episodes}} aired, Silas was angered by Rae's attitude– {{her desire to}} use men for casual flings– and {{realised}} he could frame Brendan for her murder. He then beat Rae and strangled her to death in an alleyway. [...] Barlow said that because Hollyoaks Later is broadcast late at night, there were no limits to the storyline, allowing the producers to [...] "do <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> with it." [...] She described Rae's death scene as [...] "absolutely incredible" [...] and loved {{the chance to work}} with accredited actor Rawle. She explained that Rae's death had been kept secret in order to shock viewers in the same way the death of Sarah Barnes (Loui Batley) had previously done. Barlow said she was happy and grateful with the nature of her exit storyline, as the opportunity to [...] "go out with a bang" [...] was better than Rae leaving quietly in a taxi. She hoped that Rae's murder would [...] "go down in Hollyoaks history" [...] {{as one of the best}} exits. In the aftermath, Brendan was arrested for Rae's murder after Silas planted evidence on him. Barlow stated that other characters blamed Brendan because he had caused Rae to fear for her life, and that Ste believed he was culpable because [...] "fter all the ups and downs, Ste knows exactly what the relationship between Rae and Brendan has been like and all the problems they've had." ...|$|E
500|$|Hack (1982) was {{developed}} by Jay Fenlason with help from Kenny Woodland, Mike Thome, and Jonathan Payne, students at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School at the time, while participating in the school's computer lab overseen by Brian Harvey. Harvey {{had been able to}} acquire a PDP-11/7 minicomputer for the school and instituted a course curriculum that allowed students to do <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> on the computers, including playing games, as long as they had completed assignments by the end of each semester. Fenlason, Woodland, Thome, and Payne met through these courses and became a close-group of friends and competent programmers. Harvey had invited the group to the computer labs at UC Berkeley where they had the opportunity to use the mainframe systems there, and were introduced to Rogue, inspiring them to create their own version as their class project. Fenlason had created a list of features they wanted to improve upon in Rogue such as having a level's layout saved once the player moved off that level. [...] They approached Toy and Arnold at a local USENIX conference for the source code to Rogue, but were refused, forcing them to develop the routines from scratch. The resulting program, Hack, stayed true to the original Dungeons and Dragons influences, and derived its name from being both a [...] "hack and slash" [...] game as well as a programming hack to recreate Rogue without having access to its source code. Fenlason was not able to include all the desired features, and his involvement in Hacks development concluded after the students had left the school. Fenlason had provided the source code to Hack to the USENIX conferences to be distributed on their digital tapes, from which it was later discovered and built upon through USENET newsgroups, porting it to various systems. Like Angband, the maintainership of the Hack code passed through several hands, and some variants were created by different forks.|$|E

2500|$|According to Pesci, {{improvisation}} and ad-libbing {{came out}} of rehearsals wherein Scorsese let the actors do <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted.</b> He made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines the actors {{came up with that}} he liked best, and put them into a revised script that the cast worked from during principal photography. For example, the scene where Tommy tells a story and Henry is responding to him — the [...] "Funny how? Do I amuse you?" [...] scene — is based on an actual event that happened to Pesci. It was worked on in rehearsals where he and Liotta improvised, and Scorsese recorded four to five takes, rewrote their dialogue, and inserted it into the script. The dinner scene with Tommy's mother was largely improvised. Her painting of the bearded man with the dogs was based on a photograph from National Geographic magazine. The cast did not meet Henry Hill during the film's shoot until a few weeks before it premiered. Liotta met him in an undisclosed city; Hill had seen the film and told the actor that he loved it.|$|E

When Ashley presented a bill to establish a temporary government in 1864 for a new territory to be carved out of Idaho, he again chose Montana Territory. This time Rep. Samuel Cox, also of Ohio, objected to the name. Cox complained that the name was a misnomer given most of the territory was not mountainous and that a Native American name would be more appropriate than a Spanish one.
