500|$|According to {{academic}} Robin Ellen Visel, Rosa {{is a complicated}} person, with roles thrust on her by her parents, which suppresses her own goals and desires. Gordimer explained how she constructed the book's narrative structure to convey this struggle and explain Rosa: [...] "he idea came to me of Rosa questioning herself as others see her and whether what they see is <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> is. And that developed into another stylistic question—if you're {{going to tell the}} book in the first person, to whom are you talking?" [...] This led to Gordimer creating Conrad and Katya for Rosa to use as sounding boards to question and explain herself.|$|E
500|$|Gordon {{pointed out}} that Martha was not stripping, just pole dancing. Gordon took pole dancing lessons {{for a period of}} a few weeks funded by Channel Seven, and found the {{experience}} embarrassing and physically challenging. She found it hard dancing in front of her fellow cast members, commenting that [...] "There's even one scene when all of the boys turn up at the club and they're looking at me – it's like having your mates seeing you half naked. It's not very nice, a bit intimidating but it's always exciting to have a challenging story line like that. It's worth while in the end knowing that you've put everything into it." [...] Gordon believed that the storyline was a turning point in Martha's development, as she has to hit rock bottom to realise who she is and <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> wants from life.|$|E
2500|$|Ormes {{started in}} journalism as a {{proofreader}} for the Pittsburgh Courier'. She also {{worked as an}} editor and as a freelance writer, writing on police beats, court cases and human interests topics. While she enjoyed [...] "a great career running around town, looking into everything the law would allow, and writing about it", <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> {{wanted to do was}} draw.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{should have}} been bored and bothered into being {{regularly}} good- for-nothing. You don't know <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> <b>really</b> like. <b>She's</b> nicer than anyone—-as jolly as any fellow, and yet a lady all over." ...|$|R
6000|$|Isabel {{instantly}} protested {{against this}} misrepresentation of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had <b>really</b> said, [...] "Oh, Mr. Hardyman, you quite mistake me!" ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{one chance}} of finding courage to crush him with the dreadful revelation of who <b>she</b> <b>really</b> was, of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had <b>really</b> done, was to plunge headlong into the {{disclosure}} without giving herself time to think. The shame of it would overpower her if she gave herself time to think.|$|R
2500|$|Along with Stein's {{widely known}} [...] "A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose" [...] quotation, [...] "there is no there there" [...] {{is also one}} of her most famous. It appears in Gertrude Stein, Everybody's Autobiography (Random House 1937, p 289) and is often applied to the city of her childhood, Oakland, California. Defenders and critics of Oakland have debated <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> meant when she said this in 1933, after coming to San Francisco on a book tour. She took a ferry to Oakland to visit the farm she grew up on, and the house she lived in near what is now 13th Avenue and E. 25th Street in Oakland. The house had been razed, and the {{farmland}} had been developed with new housing in the three decades since her father had sold the property and moved closer to the commercial hub of the neighborhood on Washington Street (now 12th Avenue). She wrote: ...|$|E
2500|$|Lemmy Kilmister of Motörhead {{intended}} {{to record a}} version of [...] "Black Cat" [...] with Jackson, but was prohibited. Lemmy stated, [...] "I {{wanted to do a}} version of 'Black Cat' with her, but Sony wouldn't let me. You could tell from the video that she was having a good time, that this loud rock music is <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> wanted to be doing. I love that fuckin' song.. Great fuckin' song that but the record company wouldn't let it be possible." [...] Lemmy later revealed Jackson as his most desired collaboration and planned to record a new version with her for his unreleased solo album Lemmy & Friends, saying [...] "I want to get Janet Jackson to do this great lost single called 'Black Cat'." [...] Dave Navarro recorded an additional opening and riffs throughout the version performed on Jackson's Rock Witchu Tour, appearing on screens during the rendition. Navarro previously collaborated with Jackson when remixing [...] "What'll I Do" [...] with the Red Hot Chili Peppers.|$|E
2500|$|Prior {{winning and}} {{at the time of her}} {{crowning}} she dated a French University Chemistry student named Philippe Duke. She stated in a press conference in 1971 that she approved of pre-marital sex stating [...] "we must have lots of experience" [...] and that [...] "marriage is not a simple thing". Rizk would later claim that her comments were misquoted and <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> meant was she approved of pre-marital sex but only with someone you loved or planned to marry. She then got married to Ali Hassan Salameh, a Palestinian who was chief of operations for Black September and founder of Force 17. The couple spent their honeymoon in Hawaii, and then stayed at Disneyland. When Rizk got pregnant, she returned to Beirut. Salameh was killed in 1979 by the Mossad. Salameh had been identified as a key participant in the Munich massacre, and was killed as part of Operation Wrath of God. After a couple of years, the Miss Universe got married to the renowned Lebanese singer Walid Toufic in 1990, and has two children with him. She is a judge for the Miss Lebanon competitions.|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, Watson, {{the fair}} sex is your department," [...] said Holmes, with a smile, when the dwindling frou-frou of skirts had {{ended in the}} slam of the front door. [...] "What was the fair lady's game? <b>What</b> did <b>she</b> <b>really</b> want?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Nancy and Darren marry. Fox {{explained}} that [...] "getting married {{is important to}} Nancy. For all her wanting to be alternative and different, she really just wants to be loved". Dawson said that Darren is relieved that the wedding goes ahead as he worries that Nancy is [...] "too good for him". On how marriage will affect the couple Dawson said: [...] "the only way it will change them is by giving a bit of solidity to their relationship. It proves {{to both of them}} how much they mean to each other, so if anything, I think it will make them stronger". Commenting on the couple's future Dawson said that children are [...] "definitely something that they both want, as everything's going well [...] Now that they're married, having children is something that they'll look at in the future". Fox said that Nancy's life is going well and she has a [...] "got this big family that care about her, having had no-one for so long". She added that her character [...] "loves Darren to pieces" [...] and she wanted to get married and then [...] "have babies and be happy. I think that's <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> wants". She teased that Nancy may not immediately want children but she may not have a choice in the matter.|$|E
2500|$|Nikita [...] "Nikki" [...] Singh {{is played}} by Anannya Kolvankar, and is the title {{character}} and the second-youngest Singh child. She is generally portrayed as being happy. It sometimes takes a few tries {{to get her to}} do the right thing. Many of the Singh family's adventures revolve around Nikki. Both her older brothers, Rohan and Sunny, are often seen using Nikki for their own benefit, although Rohan shows that he cares about her deeply. Sunny seems to dislike Nikki the most although, in some episodes, he is seen being quite fond of her. Himani thinks of Nikki as the perfect baby. It was revealed in [...] "Nikki is 1!" [...] that it was Dolly's idea to nickname her Nikki. Nikki speaks more often in later episodes of seasons two and three. Bobby was born on her birthday; she responded to this by [...] "I like this present." [...] In season three, her personality begins to develop, as she is seen as sneaky and mischievous, such as pretending to like a doll Himani bought for her to like Bobby, then throwing it away when she was not looking, and also telling Himani's [...] "friends" [...] <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> thinks of them, causing her to lose them all. Also, she is shown as not liking Bobby as in the episode [...] "The Extravagant Couch", when she asks Avatar if Bobby is going to stay at the hotel and he says no and Nikki asks if they can talk about it. In Good Luck Charlie, Nikki is the equivalent of Charlie Duncan who {{is played by}} Mia Talerico.|$|E

6000|$|... 'That I should! I have {{longed to}} give her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would <b>really</b> care for. <b>She</b> has been so very kind--and her {{kindness}} is so very sweet in its graciousness! I shall always be the happier for the very thinking of it.' ...|$|R

He and the other protesters likes the idea of it, but Jess is against it for a reason. When {{she tried to get}} Robin to make Becky leave by pointing out <b>what</b> <b>she's</b> <b>really</b> like on the inside, he ignores Jess and insisted she stay there. He tells her that the environmental meeting is no place to take out personal family issues. Robin also tells Jess that Becky has good ideas that he finds helpful and refreshing over her own monotone, tactical opinions.|$|R

6000|$|... "Is that <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> said, Mr. Bathurst?" [...] Isobel asked quietly, {{for he had}} {{hesitated a}} little in {{changing}} its wording.|$|E
60|$|She reddened {{a little}} after speaking, knowing {{that she had been}} {{slightly}} disingenuous. Fan understood from her face more than from her words <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> wished.|$|E

Shiodome develops a crush on her but she politely rejects him.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Tenbruggen's {{method of}} keeping Miss Jillgall in ignorance of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was <b>really</b> about, and Miss Jillgall's admirable {{confidence}} in the integrity of Mrs. Tenbruggen, being now set forth on the best authority, an exact presentation {{of the state of}} affairs will be completed if I add a word more, relating to the positions actually occupied toward Mrs. Tenbruggen's enterprise, by my correspondent and myself.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not till}} some time later, {{going over the}} {{incident}} again in his mind, he realized how very lightly Ruth had treated <b>what,</b> if <b>she</b> <b>really</b> adhered to Mrs. Porter's views on hygiene, should have been to her a dreadful discovery. The reflection was pleasant {{to him for a}} moment; it seemed to draw Ruth and himself closer together; then he saw the reverse side of it.|$|R
60|$|Ellen did not at {{that moment}} need any rouge, nor any {{artificial}} means of lending brightness to her eyes. <b>What</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> seemed to need was something to keep her still.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What kind of insect?' Alice inquired {{a little}} anxiously. <b>What</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> {{wanted to know}} was, whether it could sting or not, but she thought this wouldn't be quite a civil {{question}} to ask.|$|E
60|$|Confused by his {{ready and}} gracious {{disclaimer}} {{of what she}} had NOT intended to say, there was nothing left for her but to rush upon <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> intended to say, with what she felt was shameful precipitation.|$|E

There is an obstacle still left--the everlasting obstacle of Frank. Help me to sweep him off. Take the elder sister along with you and the lawyer, and leave me here to have {{it out with the}} younger. I want to see <b>what</b> metal <b>she's</b> <b>really</b> made of." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} I wrote to Helena, asking her <b>what</b> <b>she</b> had <b>really</b> {{said to the}} Staveleys about her age and mine, and telling her what I had said. I found it too great a trial of my {{patience}} to wait till <b>she</b> could see <b>what</b> I had written about the dispute in my journal. The days, since then, have passed, and I have been too lazy and stupid to keep my diary.|$|R
5000|$|In Philadelphia, Bowers {{was noted}} for her eccentricity. [...] Near a spring, she built a small home that the locals called [...] "Bathsheba's Bower" [...] or [...] "Bathsheba's folly" [...] and lived as a recluse. She {{cultivated}} her garden and adopted {{the principles of}} vegetarian Thomas Tryon. [...] She professed Quakerism but had a deep argumentative and independent streak. According to Bolton, Bowers was [...] "so Wild in her Notions {{it was hard to}} find out <b>what</b> religion <b>she</b> <b>really</b> was of".|$|R
6000|$|Isabel {{was briefly}} silent. [...] "I call Henrietta a very {{brilliant}} woman, but I don't {{think it will}} go far. They would never really know each other. He has not the least idea <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> is, and she has no just comprehension of Mr. Bantling." ...|$|E
6000|$|His resentment grew with {{repetition}} of his fancied grievance, {{and at last}} he made threats.

6000|$|... "Don't {{you suppose}} I {{know what the}} toll is?" [...] said {{the woman in the}} carriage. [...] "I'm sure I've {{traveled}} over this road often enough to know that.

6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Fred, sulkily, {{taking up}} {{his hat and}} whip. His {{complexion}} showed patches of pale pink and dead white. Like many a plucked idle young gentleman, he was thoroughly in love, and with a plain girl, who had no money! But having Mr. Featherstone's land in the background, and a persuasion that, let Mary say <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would, <b>she</b> <b>really</b> did care for him, Fred was not utterly in despair.|$|R
60|$|When {{these things}} were all arranged, Selina told her cousin that Adolphus was coming home, and that {{a house full of}} company had been asked to meet him. She was afraid that Fanny would be annoyed and {{offended}} at being forced to go into company so soon after her brother's death, but such was not the case. She felt, herself, that her poor brother was not the cause of the grief that was near her heart; and she would not pretend <b>what</b> <b>she</b> didn't <b>really</b> feel.|$|R
50|$|Ai Amano (Amano Ai) Beautiful, full of {{boundless}} energy. Hard to say <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is <b>really</b> like, versus <b>what</b> <b>she</b> {{was intended}} to be. Video girls are generally supposed to be comforting, nubile, excellent cooks and socially graceful, but the malfunction of Yota's VCR has made her tomboyish, at times rude, prone to violence, a terrible cook (actually, she learns to cook all by herself), but full of heart and able to feel human emotion. Her chest endowment has also shrunk considerably due to said VCR malfunction. Voiced by: Megumi Hayashibara (OAV), Minami Takayama (CD-drama), and by Maggie Blue O'Hara in the English dub. Played by: Kaori Sakagami.|$|R
