5|$|On February 20, 1997, {{which was}} the 35th anniversary of his Friendship 7 flight, Glenn {{announced}} that his retirement from the Senate <b>would</b> <b>occur</b> {{at the end of}} his term in December 1998.|$|E
5|$|Imperial's {{refinery}} in Louisiana {{was shut}} down by the company six weeks after the Port Wentworth disaster, over fears a similar explosion <b>would</b> <b>occur</b> there. It was kept from operating {{for more than a}} week. OSHA fined Imperial 36,000 over safety legislation violations at that plant.|$|E
5|$|In November 2014, the Ministry of Civil Aviation {{resolved}} {{that the}} domestic terminal of RGIA would be named after N. T. Rama Rao, resulting in protests {{from members of}} the Rajya Sabha. Airport officials remained unsure as to how the naming <b>would</b> <b>occur.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 1957 Indian {{vice presidential}} {{election}} {{was held on}} in 1957 to elect Vice-President of India. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was reelected unopposed. Should the election contested {{by more than one}} candidate, the poll <b>would</b> <b>occurred</b> on 11 May 1957.|$|R

50|$|The 1952 Indian {{vice presidential}} {{election}} {{was held in}} 1952 to elect Vice-President of India. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was elected unopposed as the first VP. Should the election contested {{by more than one}} candidate, the poll <b>would</b> <b>occurred</b> on 12 May 1952.|$|R
5|$|On 12 December 1997, the World Motorsport Council {{ruled that}} the mayor of Jerez, Pedro Pacheco, {{disrupted}} the podium ceremony. Originally, the verdict was that no further Formula One races <b>would</b> <b>occur</b> at the track. However, when Mr Pacheco appeared before the WMSC, this ruling was rescinded.|$|E
5|$|Although Parker {{had promised}} to hold auditions for {{students}} attending the Performing Arts, the school was initially advised by the Board of Education to prevent the students from working on the film, fearing it would affect their studies. It was later announced that filming <b>would</b> <b>occur</b> during the summer when the students were not attending school. Parker distributed casting call advertisements at the Performing Arts school and the High School of Music & Art.|$|E
5|$|Both Giovanni Borelli and Cassini made careful {{tables of}} {{the motions of}} Jupiter's moons, {{allowing}} predictions of the times when the moons would pass before or behind the planet. By the 1670s, {{it was observed that}} when Jupiter was {{on the opposite side of}} the Sun from Earth, these events <b>would</b> <b>occur</b> about 17minutes later than expected. Ole Rømer deduced that light does not travel instantaneously (a conclusion that Cassini had earlier rejected), and this timing discrepancy was used to estimate the speed of light.|$|E
50|$|An event E causally {{depends on}} C if, and only if, (i) if C had <b>occurred,</b> then E <b>would</b> have <b>occurred,</b> and (ii) if C had not <b>occurred,</b> then E <b>would</b> not have <b>occurred.</b>|$|R
50|$|The probabilities that hypercalcemia <b>would</b> have <b>occurred</b> in {{the first}} place by other {{candidate}} conditions can be calculated in a similar manner. However, for simplicity, let’s say that the probability that any of these <b>would</b> have <b>occurred</b> {{in the first}} place is calculated at 0.0005 in this example.|$|R
25|$|Using {{the same}} probabilities that the hypercalcemia <b>would</b> have <b>occurred</b> {{in the first}} place by the other canditate conditions, the {{probability}} that hypercalcemia <b>would</b> have <b>occurred</b> {{in the first place}} is 0.00335, and given the fact that hypercalcemia has occurred gives adjusted probabilities of 37.3%, 6.0%, 14.9% and 41.8%, respectively, for primary hyperparathyroidism, cancer, other conditions and no disease.|$|R
5|$|By {{the early}} {{afternoon}} hours, forecasters at both the SPC and the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Norman, Oklahoma, realized that a major event was likely to take place based solely on observational data from radar and weather satellite imagery and balloon soundings, as the computer models remained uncooperative in helping meteorologists determine where the greatest threat of severe storms <b>would</b> <b>occur.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the battle, however, North Korean {{troops were}} able to {{surprise}} US troops on Hill 303 and capture them. Late in the battle, these troops were machine gunned in the Hill 303 massacre. Despite these setbacks, the UN forces were successful in driving most of the North Koreans off, but the decisive battle to secure the city <b>would</b> <b>occur</b> during the Battle of the Bowling Alley.|$|E
5|$|Eta Carinae {{is a close}} binary {{and this}} complicates the {{evolution}} of both stars. Compact massive companions can strip mass from larger primary stars {{much more quickly than}} <b>would</b> <b>occur</b> in a single star, so the properties at core collapse can be very different. In some scenarios, the secondary can accrue significant mass, accelerating its evolution, and in turn be stripped by the now compact Wolf–Rayet primary. In the case of Eta Carinae, the secondary is clearly causing additional instability in the primary, making it difficult to predict future developments.|$|E
50|$|Although questioned, it {{is often}} presumed that even public {{improvements}} trigger gains in taxes above what <b>occurs,</b> or <b>would</b> have <b>occurred</b> in the district without the investment. In many jurisdictions yearly property tax increases are restricted and cannot exceed what <b>would</b> otherwise have <b>occurred.</b>|$|R

5|$|Following these events, Bourassa {{proclaimed that}} a {{referendum}} <b>would</b> <b>occur</b> in 1992, with either sovereignty {{or a new}} Constitutional agreement as the subject. This prompted a national referendum on the Charlottetown Accord of 1992, a series of amendments that included the proposals of Meech Lake as well as concerns of the broader Canadian federation. The Accord failed in Quebec and English Canada.|$|E
5|$|If magma were to rise {{towards the}} surface of Nazko, new {{earthquake}} swarms <b>would</b> <b>occur,</b> with {{a significant increase in}} the size and number of earthquakes. An eruption in the Nazko area would probably create a small cinder cone, similar to what formed Nazko Cone 7,200years ago. Immediate hazards related to cinder cone eruptions in the Nazko area would probably be forest fires and, if an eruption column were produced, redirection of nearby air traffic.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the actual formation, a phantom 76th Infantry Division was formed for deception. The phantom division {{was part of the}} notional British Fourth Army, to be used for the fictitious Operation Trolleycar. This operation aimed to deceive the Germans into believing that an Allied landing <b>would</b> <b>occur</b> along the northern German coast. While the deception effort was not a complete success, it managed to divert German attention to the northern flank {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|It was at {{this time}} that Giáp began his countermoves. He had {{expected}} an attack, but could not foresee when or where it <b>would</b> <b>occur.</b> Giáp realized that, if pressed, the French would abandon Lai Châu Province and fight a pitched battle at Điện Biên Phủ. On 24 November, Giáp ordered the 148th Infantry Regiment and the 316th Division to attack Lai Chau, while the 308th, 312th, and 351st divisions assault Điện Biên Phủ from Việt Bắc.|$|E
5|$|One of the surprises of {{the impacts}} was {{the small amount}} of water {{revealed}} compared to prior predictions. Before the impact, models of Jupiter's atmosphere had indicated that the break-up of the largest fragments <b>would</b> <b>occur</b> at atmospheric pressures of anywhere from 30 kilopascals to a few tens of megapascals (from 0.3 to a few hundred bar), with some predictions that the comet would penetrate a layer of water and create a bluish shroud over that region of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|SIM Lite {{would have}} {{operated}} in an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit, drifting away from Earth {{at the rate}} of 0.1 AU per year ultimately reaching a distance of 82million km from Earth. This would have taken approximately years. The Sun would have continuously shone on the spacecraft, allowing it to avoid the occultations of target stars and eclipses of the Sun that <b>would</b> <b>occur</b> in an Earth orbit.|$|E

5|$|The 2012 {{phenomenon}} was a {{range of}} eschatological beliefs that cataclysmic or otherwise transformative events <b>would</b> <b>occur</b> on or around 21 December 2012. This date was regarded as the end-date of a 5,126-year-long cycle in the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, and as such, festivities to commemorate the date took place on 21 December 2012 in the countries {{that were part of}} the Maya civilization (Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador), with main events at Chichén Itzá in Mexico, and Tikal in Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{considered}} Zeppelin to {{have achieved}} its main objective of tying down German {{forces in the}} region until after the invasion of Normandy, although it {{did not appear to}} convince German high command that major Allied landings <b>would</b> <b>occur</b> in the Mediterranean. Instead, Zeppelin helped the Allies achieve their objective by convincing the Germans of the threat of small invasions, stopping them from removing the defensive forces. According to Jacob Field, the operation successfully detained 25 divisions in defensive positions in the region.|$|E
