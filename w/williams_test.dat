5|$|After the Hungarian Grand Prix on 13 August, {{five teams}} {{conducted}} mid-season testing at the Silverstone Circuit on 15–17 August. McLaren test driver Olivier Panis was fastest {{on the first}} day, ahead of Frentzen. <b>Williams</b> <b>test</b> driver Bruno Junqueira's car had a water leak, resulting in repairs which limited his team's testing time. Panis remained the fastest on the second day. Jos Verstappen's Arrows car had a sensor failure, limiting his team's testing time; the car's floor {{had to be removed}} to install a new sensor. Panis was again fastest {{on the final day of}} testing. Ferrari opted to test the suspension and tyres of Michael Schumacher's car at the Fiorano Circuit. Schumacher later moved to the Mugello Circuit, with Barrichello conducting engine and setup tests, and Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer remained at Fiorano for development work on new car components. Prost opted to test at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza on 17–18 August with driver Jean Alesi. Benetton conducted a five-day, one-car test at the Danielson Circuit, with test driver Mark Webber on aerodynamic development for the first four days and Alexander Wurz concentrating on practice starts the last day.|$|E
25|$|At a test {{held at the}} Autodromo Nazionale Monza, Schumacher {{suffered}} a high-speed accident where he sustained a concussion. He was taken for a precautionary check at the circuit's medical centre before he was transferred to San Rafaele hospital. Although he {{had participated in the}} event's first qualifying session, Schumacher decided to withdraw and his place was taken by <b>Williams</b> <b>test</b> driver Marc Gené. He returned for the United States Grand Prix where he retired having {{suffered a}}n accident resulting from his car sliding on a wet track surface. At the season finale in Japan, Schumacher finished 12th despite spinning his car three times. He finished the season 5th in the Drivers' Championship, with 58 points, and helped Williams clinch 2nd in the Constructors' Championship.|$|E
500|$|Webber {{picked up}} two more 11th-place finishes, {{but was unable}} to score points for the {{remainder}} of the year, his next best result coming in France, where he finished 8th. In the , Webber lost two kilograms in weight over the length of the race as he was forced to drive without a drink after his water bottle broke. Webber was able to outqualify Yoong (and Anthony Davidson, who replaced Yoong for the Hungarian and Belgian Grands Prix) in every race, and his two points in Australia were the only points that Minardi scored all season, helping them to 9th in the Constructors' Championship, ahead of Toyota and Arrows. Webber's results earned him the [...] "Rookie of the Year" [...] award in F1 Racing magazine's annual Man of the Year awards (receiving 53.70% of public votes), the Autosport.com [...] "Rookie of the Year" [...] award and [...] "F1 Newcomer of the Year" [...] at the annual Grand Prix Party [...] "Bernie" [...] Awards. In light of his season, notable Formula One journalist Peter Windsor related Webber to [...] World Champion Nigel Mansell, saying they had similar amounts of [...] "raw talent".

2500|$|There {{were two}} driver changes {{going into the}} event: McLaren driver Nigel Mansell was {{replaced}} by the team's test driver, Mark Blundell, and Sauber driver Karl Wendlinger was replaced by <b>Williams</b> <b>test</b> driver and reigning International Formula 3000 champion Jean-Christophe Boullion. Mansell's departure was the main talking point prior {{to the beginning of the}} race meeting, as it brought the [...] World Champion's troubled relationship with McLaren to an end after just two races with the team. Mansell had made a part-time return to Formula One in [...] as a replacement for the late Ayrton Senna at Williams, but was passed over in favour of Coulthard for 1995 and opted to sign for McLaren instead. When he tested the MP4-10 chassis for the first time, it became apparent that it had a major handling imbalance, and, more seriously, that he did not fit comfortably in the cockpit. Mansell was thus forced to miss the opening two races of the season whilst the team built a wider monocoque to accommodate him. He competed in the San Marino and Spanish Grands Prix in the wider MP4-10B, but struggled to match the pace of teammate Mika Häkkinen and retired his otherwise healthy car from the latter race with handling problems. Mansell and team principal Ron Dennis subsequently agreed a mutual termination of their contract, and Blundell was restored to the seat that he had already occupied in the first two races. Blundell was employed on a race-by-race basis. The split marked the end of Mansell's Formula One career. His presence was still strong at Monaco, however, as the official tickets and publicity material featured a prominent image of his McLaren.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Memory is what creates {{perseverance}} {{and continuity}} in human and everyone's idea about himself {{depends on the}} memory. Among different psychological ideas, cognitive psychology is only one which investigated and recognized the memory. It seems mental and spiritual statuses have effects on memory and lead to memory orientation toward specific systems. According to research findings, there are spatial distortions in schizophrenics patients which are equal with main signs of schizophrenia i. e. disorders in the thoughts of these patients. Orientation has basic role to create and process the data same as thoughts in schizophrenics and normal people. Assessing such memory orientation in selecting the direction against pleasant, unpleasant and neutral stimulants {{is the purpose of}} current research Methods:   Used data in current study is related to patients and normal people reactions against pleasant, unpleasant and neutral materials of <b>William’s</b> <b>test.</b> After gathering the data, mean, variance and standard deviation were firstly, estimated and were analyzed statistically by independent T test. Results: Findings showed that there was a meaningful relationship between two mean of patients and normal people in reaction against pleasant, unpleasant and neutral stimulants of <b>William’s</b> <b>test.</b> It meaned normal people selected more pleasant stimulants than schizophrenics. Indeed, normal people selected neutral stimulants with slightly more different than schizophrenics. There was not any meaningful difference between normal people and schizophrenics only in unpleasant stimulants. Conclusion: Ability and intellectual coherence lead to mental appropriate performance and will result those people remind all memories particularly unpleasant ones with more details. Therefore it seems that memory orientation process leads to psychological status controlled the individual...|$|R
50|$|The first multi-team test session {{started in}} Jerez on 14 January 2008. Ferrari, McLaren and Toyota all tested their 2008 cars. <b>Williams</b> <b>tested</b> a {{modified}} version of the FW29 whilst Renault and Red Bull tested their 2007 entries. Honda, Toro Rosso, Super Aguri and Force India also attended. BMW Sauber was not in attendance as they were launching the F1.08. Testing then moved to Valencia on 22 January. Renault and Williams were the only teams on the track for the first day of testing. They were both testing their 2008 challengers. They were joined by every other team except Super Aguri for the next three days. 1 February saw testing move to Barcelona. Again, all teams but Super Aguri were in action. The first day of testing saw Kazuki Nakajima crash his FW30. It also saw racist abuse directed at Lewis Hamilton. <b>Williams</b> withdrew from <b>testing</b> on day three to try to fix the problem that caused Nakajima's crash. Meanwhile, on 4 February, Ferrari and Toyota moved to Bahrain to continue testing the F2008 and TF108.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2006, McArthur and Expedition 13 flight officer Jeffrey <b>Williams</b> <b>tested</b> a {{new method}} of {{preparing}} for spacewalks by [...] "camping out" [...] or spending {{the night in the}} Quest airlock, the decompression capsule through which astronauts enter and exit space. In the chamber the pressure was reduced from the normal 14.7 pounds per square inch (psi) to 10.2 psi. The more commonly used method {{of preparing for}} spacewalks involves breathing pure oxygen for several hours to purge the body of nitrogen and avoid the bends. The [...] "campout" [...] method was intended to shorten that lengthy preparation time. Four hours into their sleep an error tone prompted mission controllers to cut short the activity, though it was still deemed a success.|$|R
