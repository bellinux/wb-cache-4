50|$|Born in Carluke, Scotland, Steele was a wing half {{who started}} his {{football}} {{career as a}} part-timer first with Armadale then St Mirren while {{he worked as a}} miner before the First World War. After the war he moved to Scottish junior club Douglas <b>Water</b> <b>Thistle.</b>|$|E

Due to the disruptive effect that World War II had on football, Jarvie played a number of unofficial wartime games for Rangers, Hibernian, Falkirk and Third Lanark. During the 1950s he was player-manager of Crawley Town.|$|E

50|$|The club {{were finally}} {{admitted}} to the Central League in 1941-42. Their first season was a relatively successful one, winning their league section only to lose to Clydebank in the championship play-off. Latterly, Harp enjoyed moderate success, although they reached {{the final of the}} West of Scotland Cup in 1954-55, losing in a replay to Douglas <b>Water</b> <b>Thistle.</b> The end for the club was signalled in January 1967 when Glasgow Corporation compulsory purchased Kelvinvale Park for new housing. Harp played their final match on 7 June 1967 against Greenock Juniors losing 1-0. Although the area of the ground has been completely redeveloped, Kelvinvale was located around present day Kilmun Street.|$|E
40|$|Since the {{industrial}} revolution, {{the burning of}} fossil fuel has produced carbon dioxide at an increasing rate. Present atmospheric concentration is about ~ 1. 5 times the preindustrial level and is rising. Because carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, its increased concentration in the atmosphere {{is thought to be}} a cause of global warming. If so, the rate of global warming could be slowed if industrial carbon dioxide were not released into the atmosphere. One suggestion has been to sequester it in the deep ocean, but theory predicts that deep-sea species will be intolerant of the increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and the increased acidity it would cause. The aim of our research was to test for consequences of carbon dioxide sequestration on deep-sea, sediment-dwelling meiofauna. Recent technical advances allowed us to test for effects in situ at depths proposed for sequestration. The basic experimental unit was an open-topped container into which we pumped ~ 20 L of liquid carbon dioxide. The liquid carbon dioxide mixed with near-bottom sea water, which produced carbon dioxide-rich sea water that flowed out over the near-by seabed. We did 30 -day experiments at several locations and with different numbers of carbon dioxide-filled containers. Harpacticoid copepods (Crustacea) were our test taxon. In an experiment we did during a previous grant period, we found that large numbers of individuals exposed to carbon dioxide-rich sea water had been killed (Thistle et al. 2004). During the present grant period, we analyzed the species-level data in greater detail and discovered that, although individuals of many species had been killed by exposure to carbon dioxide-rich sea water, individuals of some species had not (Thistle et al. 2005). This result suggests that seabed sequestration of carbon dioxide will not just reduce the abundance of the meiofauna but will change the composition of the community. In another experiment, we found that some harpacticoid species swim away from an advancing front of carbon dioxide-rich sea <b>water</b> (<b>Thistle</b> et al. 2007). This result demonstrates a second way that deep-sea meiofauna react negatively to carbon dioxide-rich sea water. In summary, we used in situ experiments to show that carbon dioxide-rich sea water triggers an escape response in some harpacticoid species. It kills most individuals of most harpacticoid species that do not flee, but a few species seem to be unaffected. Proposals to reduce global warming by sequestering industrial carbon dioxide in the deep ocean should take note of these environmental consequences when pros and cons are weighed...|$|E

At Pelyn is a 17th-century house which was formerly the seat of the family of Kendall. It was originally E-shaped but only one side survives and the centre was completely redone in the early Victorian period.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1993 Experiments were {{conducted}} to determine if allelopathy is a mechanism by which buckwheat interferes with a) the growth of Canada thistle and/or b) mycorrhizae colonization in Canada thistle roots. In a competition experiment, buckwheat plant biomass was only affected by the intraspecific competition from other buckwheat plants and not by the interspecific competition from Canada thistle plants. Canada thistle plant biomass was only affected by the interspecific competition from buckwheat and not the intraspecific competition from other Canada thistle plants. Since one of the interspecific competition components was missing (Canada thistle did not affect buckwheat), the value for niche differentiation is greater than unity, indicating that buckwheat and Canada thistle are not exploiting the same resources. A niche differentiation value less than unity would have indicated that not all available resources were being used. Allelopathy is one mechanism that prevents use of all available resources. In root-shoot isolation experiments, Canada thistle biomass was significantly affected by buckwheat when growing only {{in the presence of}} buckwheat roots (shoots trained away). When growing under buckwheat's canopy, Canada thistle biomass was greater when Canada thistle roots were isolated from the buckwheat roots than when roots were not isolated. In both cases, plants were irrigated with water containing a soluble 20 - 20 - 20 (nitrogen (N) -phosphorous-potassium) fertilizer at an N concentration of 100 parts/million (wt/vol) to reduce or eliminate competition for nutrients and <b>water.</b> Canada <b>thistle</b> biomass, when both Canada thistle roots and shoots were separated from buckwheat roots and shoots, was reduced when exposed to leachates from buckwheat's root system.
