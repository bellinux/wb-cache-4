50|$|The main complex was a {{collection}} of seven cottages, in a heavily wooded compound beyond the castle's main entrance. Although each building was designed as an air raid bunker with 3 ft thick concrete walls, each had {{the appearance of a}} traditional locally built Fachwerk (half-timbered) style wooden cottage, complete with second storey dormer windows and flower baskets under a sloped tiled roof. Internally, each was furnished in traditional German style with oak floors, pine wall paneling, utilitarian leather upholstered furniture, and decorated with fringed shade <b>wall</b> <b>lamps,</b> <b>wall</b> hangings depicting hunting scenes or Teutonic battles, and a set of deer antlers.|$|R
50|$|The large {{meeting or}} {{deliberation}} {{room on the}} third floor was by the interior designer T. Nieuwenhuis. Its interior fittings are made of dark tropical woods such as mahogany, ebony and coromandel. During a renovation in 1972 the stained-glass windows were shortened, original wall coverings were redone in a lighter shade and the original <b>wall</b> <b>lamps,</b> ceiling and chandelier removed. The original chandelier, executed in openwork brass, was replaced in 1974.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, I {{wanted to}} design a lamp in {{collaboration}} with the lighting company Örsjö Belysning AB, that would contribute to stress-reduction and calmness both through visual and functional aspects. My focus in the study and the design process was on the lamps shape and light, where my primary inspiration was taken from the qualities of water. My lamp also had to fit into Örsjö Belysnings current assortment. My research showed that rounded shapes and adjustable light are two important factors for producing calmness and well-being for the user. The result of my work was a lamp with the name Harmoni. A LED floor lamp made of brass metal and acrylic plastic, with focus on rounded shapes, lightness, flexibility and symmetry. The lamp has a unique and adjustable light emission, that gives two different kinds of light from the same source. It functions both as a floor and a <b>wall</b> <b>lamp</b> in one...|$|E

The three visible entrances have highly decorated porticos with overdoor panels where a sculpture of two nude tots stand holding onto a seal.

50|$|Mostly {{known for}} his paintings, Vigeland also {{produced}} frescos, stained glass and sculptures. Noteworthy sculptures include The Virgin and the Unicorn, installed in Nygårdsparken in Bergen. Many of his designs are inspired by Christianity, and he decorated {{the interior of a}} number of churches principally in Norway. Noteworthy were the design of the interiors, from the pulpit and altar to light fixtures and other decor, in Bryn Church in Bærum, (1911-14) and the mosaics and stained glass at Gjerpen Church at Skien (1919-21). Other notable example would include the chandeliers and <b>wall</b> <b>lamps</b> in the choir and the ship in the Stavanger Cathedral, the stained glass in the Århus Cathedral, the stained glass in Lund Cathedral and stained glass of Fredrikstad Cathedral in the Diocese of Borg.|$|R
50|$|The {{renovation}} of the ground floor took five months to complete. The addition of several interior designs and furniture were actually recycled from a pile of old wood and broken furniture stocked in the refectory’s ground floor. Instead of buying new materials, the committee made use of these debris, some were restored and some were converted into brackets of the <b>wall</b> <b>lamps</b> on every post, {{the base of the}} chandeliers, the doors of the façade of the museum’s entrance, the architrave of the arched windows and even a couple of utilitarian tables which are now located at the secretary’s office.

5000|$|In the 19th century new {{processing}} {{technology was}} also introduced, {{allowing for the}} production of custom-made, unique pieces, as well as the combination of alabaster with other materials. Apart from the newly developed craft, artistic work became again possible, chiefly by Volterran sculptor Albino Funaioli. After a short slump, the industry was revived again by the sale of mass-produced mannerist Expressionist sculptures, and was further enhanced in the 1920s by a new branch creating ceiling and <b>wall</b> <b>lamps</b> in the Art Deco style and culminating in the participation at the 1925 International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts from Paris. Important names from the evolution of alabaster use after World War II are Volterran Umberto Borgna, the [...] "first alabaster designer", and later on the architect and industrial designer Angelo Mangiarotti.|$|R

40|$|The {{operating}} performance of fluorescent lamps is {{very sensitive to}} ambient temperature. Lamps operating under unfavorable conditions can have their light output and efficacy greatly reduced. To assess the temperature effect on the {{operating performance}} of fluorescent lamps, thermocouples can {{be attached to the}} lamp surface for the measurement of <b>lamp</b> <b>wall</b> temperatures. However, it is sometimes impossible or inconvenient to fix thermocouples onto the lamp surface due to difficult-to-reach lamp mounting position, etc. We believe that an infrared camera can provide a more convenient way to measure <b>lamp</b> <b>wall</b> temperatures in order to assess fluorescent lamp operating performance. This study investigates the possibility of using an infrared camera in conducting remote, non-contact measurement of <b>lamp</b> <b>wall</b> temperatures. The results of this investigation will form a basis {{for the development of a}} methodology for assessing the performance of fluorescent lighting installations during commissioning, at different stages during the operating life of fluorescent lamps and in maintenance checks.

40|$|Figure 1 : Adding an {{artificial}} object to an existing video usually requires high-end tools and intensive user interaction. Our system allows to inlay {{any number of}} objects, a balcony and the <b>wall</b> <b>lamps</b> on the right, into any video via a simple user interface and minimal user interaction. This is achieved by representing the video structure and texture as a mosaic (center).

25|$|The Foundation’s current {{collection}} of furniture only includes {{a small part}} of the Villa’s original furniture, given that many of these items were sold at auctions and thus dispersed, prior to acquisition of the property by the Portuguese State. The main exceptions are: the dining-room furniture (repurchased by the Foundation) and the interior architecture equipment (doors, embedded cupboards, doorknobs, bathroom furniture, etc.). During the restoration process of the Villa, overseen by the architect Álvaro Siza, the latter items were preserved with great care. Part of the Villa’s furniture was acquired from leading interior decorators of the period. Several items were brought from the Count’s residence in Biarritz. He also added antiques, which he inherited from the family, thus creating an overall eclectic style. Ruhlmann and Leleu design several items of furniture and Silva Bruhns designed the carpets. Edgar Brandt designed a wrought iron gate of the hall and several <b>wall</b> <b>lamps.</b> Jean Perzel designed the lamps. Other refined aspects of the Villa’s interior decoration include the blue limestone and exotic hardwood floors; the marble-lined bathrooms, with stone-carved bathtubs; the geometric patterns of the plasterwork; and the curved form of the library staircase.|$|R
