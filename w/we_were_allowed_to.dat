25|$|In the {{tried and}} true way of all major labels at the time, {{they really wanted to}} sign Dave but got a {{troublesome}} band instead. It was probably Island's insistence that Alsy and Marty weren't up to it that caused the Craig Leon sessions to be the unmitigated disaster that they were. Now I could be wrong here, maybe Craig wanted them out, maybe both. We were pretty much forced to let a couple of session guys stand in – no names because it wasn't their fault – and we could tell straight away that this was applying a straightener to the normally unruly quiff that was the band. It was also sucking the essence of the band out. Anyway, it's a sorry little interlude that I should draw the curtain on. The sessions were scrapped and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> be The Triffids again.|$|E
500|$|Milena Markovna Kunis {{was born}} on August 14, 1983 in Chernivtsi, Ukraine in the Soviet Union. Her mother, Elvira, is a physics teacher who runs a pharmacy, and her father, Mark Kunis, is a {{mechanical}} engineer {{who works as a}} cab driver. Kunis has an elder brother named Michael. Her mother tongue and the common language within her family is Russian. She stated in 2011 that her parents had [...] "amazing jobs", and that she [...] "was very lucky" [...] and the family was [...] "not poor"; they had decided to leave the USSR because they saw [...] "no future" [...] there for Mila and her brother. In 1991, when she was seven years old, her family moved to Los Angeles, California, with $250. [...] "That was all <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> take with us. My parents had given up good jobs and degrees, which were not transferable. We arrived in New York on a Wednesday and by Friday morning my brother and I were at school in LA." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{accidental}} {{death of her}} only brother, Michael (1911–1932), made Carte the heir to her father's hotel and theatre interests. [...] As a child, however, she had been reluctant to assume the family legacy. [...] She later told The Gramophone magazine: [...] "At home, you know, we weren't allowed to hum Gilbert and Sullivan; in fact we were fined for it, because it annoyed my father. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> sing it properly, but my brother and I couldn't – in my family the fact that I wasn't Mozart at about three years old was thought of as rather disappointing. So I went through a phase when I was very anti-Gilbert and Sullivan; I became rather a highbrow, and my father thought I {{was a bit of}} a snake-in-the-grass because of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1994 Steć, Pazik, Major Donny MacNeil of Canada and Colonel Clayton Yaache of Ghana {{along with}} four Tunisian UNAMIR peacekeepers {{attempted}} unsuccessfully an evacuation {{of some of}} those trapped in the Hotel des Mille Collines with MacNeil and Steć reading the names of those to be evacuated in the crowded hotel lobby. [...] "I had a 'Schindler's List' of the people <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> save. The conditions were: they did need a visa guarantee and a financial guarantee that they would be received outside Rwanda (...). Although approved by the Rwandan Chief of Staff, the convoy was halted by military and militia and following a very dangerous stand off they managed to return the refuges safely to the Hotel des Milles Collines. A few blocks away from the Mille Collines, there was a church, l' Eglise St. Famille, with more than 5000 refugees. Every night militia were killing people there. We did nothing to evacuate them and I guess it was because they didn't have visas".|$|E
