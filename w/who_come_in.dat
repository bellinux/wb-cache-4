5|$|The serial {{continues}} the loose chronology of the Quatermass adventures. Workmen excavating {{a site in}} Knightsbridge, London, discover a strange skull and what at first {{appears to be an}} unexploded bomb. Quatermass and his newly appointed military superior at the British Experimental Rocket Group, Colonel Breen, become involved in the investigation when it becomes apparent that the object is an alien spacecraft. The ship and its contents have a powerful and malign influence over many of those <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> contact with it, including Quatermass. It becomes obvious to him that the aliens, probably from Mars, had been abducting pre-humans and modifying them to give them psychic abilities much like their own before returning them to Earth, a genetic legacy responsible for much of the war and strife in the world.|$|E
5|$|Players build a {{space station}} on a flat plane using tetromino-shaped floors that {{represent}} rooms. Rectangular workers generate the resources to build more spaces by working in these rooms. The workers occasionally must defend the base against attackers, <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> waves of increasing difficulty. The player can have the workers research four TMA-1-style monoliths for additional shield, speed, and generator upgrades. Rooms are used for special purposes: mineral mining (extractors), growing food (gardens), cooking it (kitchens), making workers (quarters), and creating power (reactors). The goal is to flourish and protect the station's inhabitants, but there are three concrete objectives: research all four monoliths, survive 28 waves, and research all monoliths in under 45 minutes. The game ends if all workers are killed. There is a tutorial, but no story. The player is not specifically told about the endgame goals.|$|E
25|$|As of 2016 {{there is}} no {{specific}} vaccine or treatment for the disease. However, a number of antiviral medications are currently being studied. The World Health Organization recommends that those <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> contact with camels wash their hands frequently and do not touch sick camels. They also recommend that camel products be appropriately cooked. Among those who are infected treatments that help with the symptoms may be given.|$|E

25|$|Drilling has {{increased}} {{two out of}} six “criteria” pollutants (particulate matter and ozone) that the EPA regulates due to their negative impacts. People <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> contact with these air pollutants can have severe health problems such as respiratory issues, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. A study has found that people within {{half a mile from}} a gas well site {{were more likely to have}} health problems from air pollution than people living farther.|$|E
25|$|Complications of postsurgical wounds can {{be reduced}} before, during and after surgery. Before surgery, clinicians can treat the patient to reduce {{hemoglobin}} A1c levels to less than 7%. Those anticipating surgery can reduce their risk of complications by stopping smoking thirty days prior to surgery. The patient's skin can be evaluated {{for the presence of}} Staphylococcus areus prior to surgery since this bacterium causes wound infections in postoperative wounds. Treating any other infections prior to surgery also reduces the risks of a postoperative wound infection. Examples of these pre-existing infections are urinary tract infection or lower reproductive system infection. Removing the hair where the skin will be cut helps {{to reduce the risk of}} complications, though shaving is not considered to be appropriate and instead depilatories are used. Those <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> contact with the person who is receiving the surgery clean and disinfect their own skin surfaces. The patient's skin is also cleaned, scrubbed and treated with antiseptics. Patients undergoing surgery often receive antibiotics before surgery.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{made several}} other changes going from season one to season two, {{including}} making the scripts more focused around the entire cast {{rather than just}} Leslie. They also tried to make Leslie appear more intelligent in the second season after receiving audience feedback that she appeared [...] "ditzy", which Michael Schur said was never their intention. Schur said, [...] "In the end, we just felt that Amy is an enormously likable presence on screen, so as the season went on we just tried to create situations where that would shine through." [...] During the episode [...] "Kaboom", a major subplot was resolved when the large construction pit that Leslie had long sought {{to turn into a}} park was filled with dirt and turned into a lot. The pit was first established in the premiere episode and had been a focal point of the series since the show began. Schur said while the pit project was originally conceived as a device to bring all the characters together working toward a common goal, and it was expected to only become a park during the series finale. However, Schur said he felt the early episodes were too focused on the pit and had led viewers to believe the entire show was about filling the pit, which was not the writers' intention, so they accelerated the resolution of that story arc. The idea of Ben and Chris, two state auditors <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> from outside Pawnee to help the town deal with budget problems, was conceived from news reports at the time of a number of states considering shutting down schools, parks and other services due to the global recession.|$|E

This is most important for patients whose intimate partners are pregnant or those who are parents of young children as both of these groups are more vulnerable to the masculinizing effects of androgens. [...] of significant virilization of young children after exposure to topical androgen preparations (both prescription and 'supplement' products) used by their caregivers demonstrates this very real risk.|$|E
2500|$|What is {{distinctive}} about Leigh Hunt, {{according to}} Hazlitt, and compensates for his faults as an author, is his captivating personality. [...] "Indeed, the very faults of his style are virtues in the individual. His natural gaiety and spriteliness of manner, his high animal spirits, and the vinous {{quality of his}} mind, produce an immediate fascination and intoxication in those <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> contact with him ... His look, his tone are required to point many things that he says ..." [...] Even Hunt's egotism becomes excusable on better acquaintance: [...] "his frank, cordial manner reconciles you instantly to a little over-bearing, over-weening self-complacency." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chennai Port Trust {{has plans}} to build a marina along a [...] stretch in the west quay to berth a dozen yachts. The marina will provide lockers, {{separate}} berths and other facilities to these sailors, <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> small boats. The sailors can then proceed inland for sightseeing. However, the plan still remains on paper. Although the plan to build a large-scale marina is at the proposal stage, the port cannot have a marina till the coal yard is vacated. After coal handling is moved out, the port will reclaim land by constructing groynes—rigid hydraulic structures built from an ocean shore that interrupt water flow and limit the movement of sediment.|$|E

[...] For rodents, snap traps may be effective, and if needed, a professional exterminator should be called. [...] Poison baited traps should be avoided, as the rodent could die somewhere inaccessible, and provide {{a breeding ground for}} further pests. [...] Also, {{in the case of a}} rodent infestation, all access points to the room (such as cracks or holes) through which they might be entering should be located and sealed if possible.|$|E
2500|$|In 1889, Dr. George Edward Reed {{assumed the}} {{position}} of President of Dickinson College and continued the close relationship between the Indian School and Dickinson College through Pratt's departure in 1904.

[...] In June 1911, Reed addressed the one hundred and twenty-eighth commencement of Dickinson College, where he presented an Honorary Degree of Master of Arts to Pratt's successor, Superintendent Moses Friedman, for his work at the Carlisle Indian School.|$|E

2500|$|Brad Neely {{provides}} the voices for Steve Smith, Frank Smith, and Mark [...] "Baby" [...] Cakes; Weidenfeld states that Neely does [...] "the heavy lifting with the voices ... every episode, he's probably at least 40% of the lines." [...] According to him, {{it allows for}} production to run more seamlessly: [...] "Rather than hav to wait for somebody else's schedule, we just go next door and do it." [...] Neely also records temporary [...] "scratch" [...] lines for other actors to speed up production. Neely stated that in voicing [...] "a full episode's work of somebody, we start the day as an actor." [...] For voice-over work, the crew works on {{two or three hours}} of dialogue for a certain character, followed by storyboard meetings, dailies, and rough cuts, with Neely directing other actors <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> after him.|$|E
2500|$|To master {{all of the}} Ring's capabilities, a Ring wielder {{would need}} a disciplined and well-trained mind, a strong will, and great native power. Those with weaker minds, such as Hobbits and lesser Men, would gain little benefit from the Ring, let alone realize its full potential. Even for someone with the {{necessary}} strength, {{it would have taken}} time to master the Ring's power {{to the point where he}} was strong enough to overthrow Sauron. The prospect of mastery is the main appeal that the Ring holds for those <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> contact with it. The Ring appears as a symbol of hope, offering the power to defeat Sauron and bring peace to the world. [...] Yet in the end, its inherent malevolence would twist its bearer into another Dark Lord as evil as Sauron, regardless of one's intentions at the outset.|$|E

2500|$|The {{series was}} {{originally}} {{conceived as a}} web series on Adult Swim's defunct comedy website, Super Deluxe, in 2008. Neely, who had done Baby Cakes and The Professor Brothers shorts for Super Deluxe in 2006, envisioned the characters in each series to coexist in the same universe. With the relationship in mind, he produced a four-part internet series entitled China, IL, which was published on Super Deluxe in 2008. An 11-minute television special combining the shorts, titled [...] "China, IL: The Funeral", aired on Adult Swim on May 25, 2008. Neely stated that a major inspiration behind {{the premise of the}} series derives from his lack of college experiences and his Arkansan upbringing. Episodes are written among a writing staff of six to eight people; for voice-over work, the crew works on two or three hours of dialogue for a certain character, followed by storyboard meetings, dailies, and rough cuts, with Neely directing other actors <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> after him.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the third}} annual High School Hoops magazine, the players {{weighed in on}} the subject of the new rules {{regarding}} draft eligibility. Many of them felt that it was unfair. Kansas State freshman Bill Walker, said (as a junior in high school), [...] "I'm against it. I don't see why you have to be 19 to play a game of basketball when you can be 18 and go to war for our country and die. It's ridiculous." [...] Jerryd Bayless said [...] "It's not fair at all. If a tennis player can go pro at 13, I don't understand why a basketball player can't go pro at 18." [...] A possible number one pick out of high school, had the rule not been put in place, was Greg Oden (though he was still picked first in 2007). When asked about the agreement he said [...] "It's unfair, but it's over with now, so there's no reason to complain." [...] In spite of the claims that the rule is unfair, Wayne Ellington of North Carolina, said that [...] "…I also think it's going to help the league a little bit. Some guys <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> like from this year's draft, it will help." [...] Brandan Wright said that [...] "It may hurt guys who need money, but it will help people grow and develop." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many beliefs {{regarding}} women’s {{bodies and}} their {{health in the}} Islamic context {{can be found in}} the religious literature known as [...] "medicine of the prophet." [...] These texts suggested that men stay away from women during their menstrual periods, “for this blood is corrupt blood,” and could actually harm those <b>who</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> contact with it. [...] Much advice was given with respect to the proper diet to encourage female health and in particular fertility. [...] For example: quince makes a woman’s heart tender and better; incense will result in the woman giving birth to a male; the consumption of water melons while pregnant will increase the chance the child is of good character and countenance; dates should be eaten both before childbirth to encourage the bearing of sons and afterwards to aid the woman’s recovery; parsley and the fruit of the palm tree stimulates sexual intercourse; asparagus eases the pain of labor; and eating the udder of an animal increases lactation in women. [...] In addition to being viewed as a religiously significant activity, sexual activity was considered healthy in moderation for both men and women. [...] However, the pain and medical risk associated with childbirth was so respected that women who died while giving birth could be viewed as martyrs. [...] The use of invocations to God, and prayers were also a part of religious belief surrounding women's health, the most notable being Muhammad's encounter with a slave-girl whose scabbed body he saw as evidence of her possession by the Evil Eye. [...] He recommended that the girl and others possessed by the Eye use a specific invocation to God in order to rid themselves of its debilitating effects on their spiritual and physical health.|$|E
