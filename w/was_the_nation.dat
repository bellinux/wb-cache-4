2500|$|The Church of the Nazarene is {{an evangelical}} Christian {{denomination}} {{that emerged from}} the 19th-century Holiness movement in North America. With its members commonly referred to as Nazarenes, it is the largest Wesleyan-holiness denomination in the world. At the end of September 2016 the Church of the Nazarene had 2,471,553 members in 30,574 churches in 162 different [...] "world areas". The Church of the Nazarene uses [...] "world area" [...] to describe countries and areas that are a part of a country, but may be known by a different name. More than 20 of the denomination's 162 world areas fall into this category, such as Guam, a U.S. territory on the Asia-Pacific Region. With 626,811 members at the end of 2016, the United States <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> with the greatest number of Nazarenes. Other nations with large Nazarene populations include Mozambique (202,118), Brazil (153,002), India (136,079), Haiti (134,236), Bangladesh (123,192), Guatemala (90,101), Mexico (70,700), Peru (67,394), Benin (56,036), and Ethiopia (50,361). In 2016, the Church of the Nazarene had the highest percentage presence in the nations of Barbados (where its members constitute 2.84% of the population), Cape Verde (1.54% of the population), Swaziland (1.42% of the population), Haiti (1.34% of the population) Mozambique (0.82% of the population), and Samoa (0.66% of the population).|$|E
2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of World War I, Arsuzi began studying at Institut Laïc in Lebanon. It was here that Arsuzi was introduced to philosophy. Also, during his stay, Arsuzi was able to perfect his French. During Arsuzi's studying at Institut Laïc his atheism became notorious, and he was often caught saying [...] "Sons of Earth are more capable of directing their affairs than sons of heaven." [...] After finishing his studies, Arsuzi {{got a job as}} a mathematics teacher in a local secondary school in Antioch. However, he later received the job of heading the school district of Arsuz – a job he held from 1924–26. In 1927 Arsuzi received a scholarship from the French High Commission to study at the Sorbonne University in France. He studied there from 1927 to 1930, but never obtained a degree from the Sorbonne. During his stay at the Sorbonne, Arsuzi befriended former French colonial administrator Jean Gaulmier. At the Sorbonne, Arsuzi developed an interest in 19th-century European philosophy; he became attracted to the thoughts of Georges Dumas, Emile Brehier, Leon Brunschvig (his philosophy professor), Henri Bergson and Johann Gottlieb Fichte among others. The books which influenced Arsuzi most at the time were Bergson's L'Evolution créatrice and Fichte's Reden an die deutsche Nation; of these, Fichte is the philosopher Arsuzi identified most with. Both Fichte and Bergson wrote of the importance of education and in the core there <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation.</b>|$|E

60|$|In their lifelong {{devotion to}} a single purpose the two chief poets of the Victorian Age are much alike; in most other respects they are men of contrasts. Tennyson looked like a poet, Browning like a {{business}} man. Tennyson was a solitary singer, never in better company than when alone; Browning was a city man, who must have the excitement of society. Tennyson's field <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation,</b> its traditions, heroes, problems, ideals; but Browning seldom went beyond the individual man, and his purpose was to play Columbus to some obscure human soul. Tennyson was at times rather narrowly British; Browning was a cosmopolitan who dealt broadly with humanity. Tennyson was the poet of youth, {{and will always be}} read by the young in heart; Browning was the philosopher, the psychologist, the poet of mature years and of a few cultivated readers.|$|E
60|$|Indeed, a fine {{country in}} the western part of Mardi, in this very manner, became a sovereign--nay, a republican state. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> to which Mohi had {{previously}} alluded--Vivenza. But in the flush and pride of having recently attained their national majority, the men of Vivenza were perhaps too much inclined to carry a vauntful crest. And because intrenched in their fastnesses, after much protracted fighting, they had eventually succeeded in repelling the warriors dispatched by Bello to crush their insurrection, they were unanimous in the opinion, that the hump-backed king had never before been so signally chastised. Whereas, they had not so much vanquished Bello, as defended their shores; even as a young lion will protect its den against legions of unicorns, though, away from home, he might be torn to pieces. In truth, Braid-Beard declared, that at the time of this war, Dominora couched ten long spears for every short javelin Vivenza could dart; though the javelins were stoutly hurled as the spears.|$|E

And for all this, the thanks they got were cuffs and contempt; and so poor-spirited were they that they took even this sort of attention as an honor.|$|E

They were an ugly, small, but active race, and used to cut their children's faces that the scars might make them look more terrible to their enemies. Just at this time a great spirit of conquest had come upon them, and they had, as said before, driven the Goths over the Danube fifty years ago, and seized the lands we still call Hungary. A most mighty and warlike chief called Attila had become their head, and wherever he went his track was marked by blood and flame, so that he was called [...] "The Scourge of God." [...] His home was {{on the banks of the}} Theiss, in a camp enclosed with trunks of trees, for he did not care to dwell in cities or establish a kingdom, though the wild tribes of Huns from the furthest parts of Asia followed his standard--a sword fastened to a pole, which was said to be also his idol.|$|E

60|$|Such was his terrible demand {{upon the}} country for its own salvation. But such, as we have seen, was not war as Principal Souza {{and some of his}} adherents {{understood}} it. They had not the foresight to perceive the inevitable result of this strategic plan if effectively and thoroughly executed. They did not even realise that the devastation had better be effected by the British in this defensive--and in its results at the same time overwhelmingly offensive--manner than by the French {{in the course of a}} conquering onslaught. They did not realise these things partly because they did not enjoy Wellington's full confidence, and in a greater measure because they were blinded by self-interest, because, as O'Moy told Forjas, they placed private considerations above public duty. The northern nobles whose lands must suffer opposed the measure violently; they even opposed the withdrawal of labour from those lands which the Militia Act had rendered necessary. And Antonio de Souza made himself their champion until he was broken by Wellington's ultimatum to the Council. For broken he <b>was.</b> <b>The</b> <b>nation</b> had come to a parting of the ways.

6000|$|When, in 1876, {{the eastern}} {{question}} was forced {{forward by the}} [...] disturbances in the Turkish empire, and especially by the cruel [...] outrages in Bulgaria, I shrank naturally but perhaps unduly from [...] recognising the claim they made upon me individually. I hoped that [...] the ministers would recognise the moral obligations to the subject [...] races of the east, which we had in honour contracted as parties to [...] the Crimean war and to the peace of Paris in 1856. I was slow to [...] observe the real leanings of the prime minister, his strong [...] sympathy with the Turk, and his mastery in his own cabinet. I [...] suffered others, Forster in particular, to go far ahead of me. At [...] {{the close of the}} session [1876] a debate was raised upon the [...] subject, and I had at length been compelled to perceive that the [...] old idol was still to be worshipped at Constantinople, and that, [...] as the only person surviving in the House of Commons who had been [...] responsible for the Crimean war and the breaking of the bulwark [...] raised by the treaty of Kainardji on behalf of the eastern [...] Christians, I could no longer remain indifferent. Consequently in [...] that debate Mr. Disraeli had to describe my speech as the only one [...] that had exhibited a real hostility to the policy of the [...] government. It was, however, at that time an opposition without [...] hope. I went into the country, and had mentally postponed all [...] further action to the opening of the next session, when I learned [...] from the announcement of a popular meeting to be held in Hyde Park [...] that the question was alive.(339) So I at once wrote and published [...] on the Bulgarian case. From that time forward, till the final [...] consummation in 1879-80, I made the eastern question the main [...] business of my life. I acted under a strong sense of individual [...] duty without a thought of leadership; nevertheless it made me [...] again leader whether I would or no. The nation nobly responded to [...] the call of justice, and recognised the brotherhood of man. But it [...] <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation,</b> not the classes. When, {{at the close of the}} session [...] of 1876, there was the usual dispersion in pursuit of recreation, [...] I thought the occasion was bad. It was good, for the nation did [...] not disperse and the human heart was beating. When the clubs [...] refilled in October, the Turkish cause began again to make head. [...] Then came a chequered period, and I do not recollect to have [...] received much assistance from the “front bench.” Even Granville [...] had been a little startled at my proceedings, and wished me to [...] leave out the “bag and baggage” from my pamphlet.|$|E
60|$|It {{may not be}} {{improper}} {{to pause}} here for a few moments, and to consider a little more minutely the causes which had produced the grand revolution in favor of liberty by which this reign was distinguished, and to draw all the circumstances which led to this remarkable event into a single point of view. Since the death of Edward the Confessor only two princes succeeded to the crown upon undisputed titles. William the Conqueror established his by force of arms. His successors were obliged to court the people by yielding many of the possessions {{and many of the}} prerogatives of the crown; but they supported a dubious title by a vigorous administration, and recovered by their policy, {{in the course of their}} reign, what the necessity of their affairs obliged them to relinquish for the establishment of their power. Thus <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> kept continually fluctuating between freedom and servitude. But the principles of freedom were predominant, though the thing itself was not yet fully formed. The continual struggle of the clergy for the ecclesiastical liberties laid open at the same time the natural claims of the people; and the clergy were obliged to show some respect for those claims, in order to add strength to their own party. The concessions which Henry the Second made to the ecclesiastics on the death of Becket, which were afterwards confirmed by Richard the First, gave a grievous blow to the authority of the crown; as thereby an order of so much power and influence triumphed over it in many essential points. The latter of these princes brought it very low by the whole tenor of his conduct. Always abroad, the royal authority was felt in its full vigor, without being supported by the dignity or softened by the graciousness of the royal presence. Always in war, he considered his dominions only as a resource for his armies. The demesnes of the crown were squandered. Every office in the state was made vile by being sold. Excessive grants, followed by violent and arbitrary resumptions, tore to pieces the whole contexture of the government. The civil tumults which arose in that king's absence showed that the king's lieutenants at least might be disobeyed with impunity. Then came John to the crown. The arbitrary taxes which he imposed very early in his reign, which, offended even more by the improper use made of them than their irregularity, irritated the people extremely, and joined with all the preceding causes to make his government contemptible. Henry the Second, during his contests with the Church, had the address to preserve the barons in his interests. Afterwards, when the barons had joined in the rebellion of his children, this wise prince found means to secure the bishops and ecclesiastics. But John drew upon himself at once the hatred of all orders of his subjects. His struggle with the Pope weakened him; his submission to the Pope weakened him yet more. The loss of his foreign territories, besides what he lost along with them in reputation, made him entirely dependent upon England: whereas his predecessors made one part of their territories subservient to the preservation of their authority in another, where it was endangered. Add to all these causes the personal character of the king, in which there was nothing uniform or sincere, and which introduced the like unsteadiness into all his government. He was indolent, yet restless, in his disposition; fond of working by violent methods, without any vigor; boastful, but continually betraying his fears; showing on all occasions such a desire of peace as hindered him from ever enjoying it. Having no spirit of order, he never looked forward,--content by any temporary expedient to extricate himself from a present difficulty. Rash, arrogant, perfidious, irreligious, unquiet, he made a tolerable head of a party, but a bad king, and had talents fit to disturb another's government, not to support his own.|$|E
