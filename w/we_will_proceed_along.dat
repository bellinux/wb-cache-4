40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to re-examine the support for the 'oil hinders democracy' {{hypothesis}}. Following Michael Ross' seminal article 'Does oil hinder democracy?' (2001), the hypothesis has been supported by a number of cross-national empirical tests. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>proceed</b> <b>along</b> two routes, one conceptual and one temporal/contextual. Using time-series cross-section data from 132 countries between 1977 - 2006 we find that Ross' theory does not stand the test of time, and that a broader conceptual take on the notion of democracy has left the theory more inconclusive than in previous studies. The jury appears to be out concerning the generality of the 'oil hinders democracy' hypothesis. ...|$|E
