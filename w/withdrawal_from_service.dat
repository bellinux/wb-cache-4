5|$|In May 1982, three Phantoms from 29 Squadron were forward {{deployed}} to RAF Wideawake on Ascension Island to provide air {{cover for the}} RAF's operations during the Falklands War, replacing Harriers of 1 Squadron, which were transiting to the war zone. In August 1982, {{following the end of}} the conflict and the reconstruction of the runway, 29 Squadron detached a number of its aircraft to RAF Stanley to provide air defence for the Falkland Islands. Late the following year, 23 Squadron took up the role, remaining stationed there until October 1988, when they were replaced by 1435 Flight. To make up for the loss of an entire squadron from the UK Air Defence Region, the RAF procured 15 second-hand F-4J Phantoms that had previously been used by the US Navy. These aircraft were operated by 74 Squadron from 1984 until 1991, when they were replaced by FGR.2 Phantoms that had been released by other squadrons following their conversion to the Tornado. Initially, it was intended that Phantoms and Tornados serve alongside each other. A total of 152 Tornado F.3s were ordered for the RAF, enough to convert four squadrons of Phantoms and two of Lightnings, but insufficient to completely convert every air defence squadron. Both 23 and 29 Squadrons converted from the Phantom FGR.2 to the Tornado between 1987 and 1988, alongside the conversion of the final two remaining Lightning squadrons. The intention was to retain a pair of UK based Phantom squadrons at RAF Wattisham, alongside a pair of Tornado units at RAF Coningsby to provide air defence cover for the southern half of the UK Air Defence Region. Another two squadrons stationed in Germany would also be retained. The end of the Cold War however led to a more rapid withdrawal of Phantom units than had originally been planned; under the Options for Change defence review the Phantom was to be withdrawn from service, with the two Germany based units disbanded as part of the gradual run down of the RAF's presence, and a {{reduction in the number of}} air defence squadrons leading to the two UK based units being disbanded in late 1992. However, just prior to the final withdrawal of the Phantom, it was recalled operationally as a result of Operation Granby, the UK's participation in the First Gulf War, when a total of six aircraft from 19 and 92 Squadrons were forward {{deployed to}} provide air defence cover at RAF Akrotiri; this was to replace the Tornados that had been originally deployed there on exercise, and were subsequently sent to the Gulf region. Following their final <b>withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> <b>service,</b> with a few exceptions, the bulk of the RAF's FGR.2 fleet was scrapped. Over its service life, 37 FGR.2s were lost to crashes.|$|E

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Special education students receive specialized instruction, yet they are dropping out twice as often as their nondisabled peers (Smink & Cash, 2006). Dropping out is not a sudden, impulsive decision. <b>Withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> school happens as a gradual process of disengagement or alienation that occurs over time. Dropping out is not a spur-of-the-moment decision; it is {{the end of a long}} process of disengagement (Rumberger, 2004). Young people who prematurely withdraw from school face a difficult future and may experience exclusion from education, training, employment, and society (Smink & Cash). Missouri public special education students are withdrawing or dropping out of school (Balfanz & Legters, 2004) and further investigation is needed. Currently in Missouri there is a lack of knowledge due to a lack of information as to the reasons for <b>withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> <b>services</b> in association with special education disability conditions and district size. Therefore, investigation was needed to discover why students with disabilities in Missouri were withdrawing <b>from</b> <b>services</b> and/or school before graduation. Explorations were needed to determine dropout factors and discover if size of school and disabling condition are compounding variables. The purpose of this study was to investigate public school special education student data sets collected by the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE). Missouri DESE, DSE provided archival data from the academic year 2005 to inform this study. Quantitative analysis and descriptive statistics were utilized to describe, analyze, and summarize Missouri's special education <b>withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> <b>services</b> data. A factorial non-experimental research design was utilized to answer the research questions. The factors studied were: special education dropout, free and reduced lunch rate (9 - 12), size of district, high school, 14 - 21 child count, dropout rate by labeling condition, age, gender, ethnicity, and district reported reason for the special education student <b>withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> <b>services.</b> Best practices literature for dropout prevention was additionally researched and reported. This study will inform Missouri DESE Division of Special Education (DSE) of the findings with regard to policy analysis and decision making concerning special education students <b>withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> special education <b>services...</b>|$|R
25|$|After the American {{entry into}} World War I in early 1917, many guns {{were removed from}} coast {{defenses}} for potential service on the Western Front. Most of these weapons were not sent overseas or did not see action; however, most of the heavy guns in the Baltimore area were dismounted in 1917–18 and not returned to the forts. Battery McFarland's three 8-inch guns were removed in 1917 for potential use as railway artillery, while Battery Winchester's 12-inch gun was sent to Fort Wadsworth, Staten Island, New York to replace a gun sent to the railway artillery program. With the war over, in 1920 Fort Armistead's service came to a close; Battery Mudge's 3-inch guns were scrapped {{as part of a}} general <b>withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> <b>service</b> of the 3-inch M1898 gun type.|$|E
25|$|K 177: Hamilton, Victoria. Following <b>withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> <b>service,</b> this {{locomotive}} {{was sold}} to the Langhi Morgala Museum in Ararat and placed on display. It was subsequently acquired by the Mornington Railway Preservation Society and transferred to Moorooduc. Further inspection revealed a number of parts beyond restoration, so a complex deal was worked out with other organisations over the late 1990s. The end result was that the frame of K 177 was placed at Hamilton, Victoria, along with its own coupled wheels, motion gear and smoke deflectors. K 159 donated the tender body, frame and bogies, and K 174 provided the boiler, smokebox, funnel and pony truck. The engine is currently un-numbered, but during the transition process it was alternately known as the Hamilton Exchange Locomotive or K 193.|$|E
25|$|After the 1904 speed record, 3440 {{continued}} in everyday service {{until it was}} rendered obsolete in 1931, being withdrawn from service in March that year. The historical significance of City of Truro led to the locomotive's survival after <b>withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> <b>service,</b> with the GWR's Chief Mechanical Engineer Charles Collett asking that the engine be preserved at the London and North Eastern Railway's Railway Museum at York when she was withdrawn in 1931, after {{the directors of the}} GWR had refused to preserve the engine at the company's expense. It was donated to the LNER, being sent from Swindon on 20 March 1931, and was subsequently displayed at the new museum in York. During World War 2 York was considered to be a likely bombing target so the locomotive was evacuated to the small engine shed at Sprouston station (near Kelso) on the Tweedmouth to St Boswells line in the Scottish Borders.|$|E
25|$|After <b>withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> Aeroflot <b>service</b> on 27 August 1972, 25 An-10A {{aircraft}} {{which were}} in good condition were transferred to the VVS (Soviet Air Force) and other MAP (Ministry of Aircraft Production) units. These remaining An-10As were retired by 1974.|$|R

500|$|The Australian Government and RAAF were {{embarrassed by}} the rapid <b>withdrawal</b> <b>from</b> <b>service</b> of {{aircraft}} that had been acquired at considerable cost.
