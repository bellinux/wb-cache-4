5|$|The marshall's moans of pain get worse, {{disturbing}} the other survivors. Eventually he asks to see Kate alone, {{and when she}} enters the tent, the marshal asks what Kate <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him before he was knocked unconscious during the crash. Kate tells him {{she wants to make}} sure Ray gets his reward. The marshal laughs, telling Kate that she is one of a kind, and then asks if he is going to die. Kate nods, and he asks if she is going to do it. As Kate leaves, Sawyer enters with the gun, and a gunshot is heard. Jack becomes angry but Sawyer claims that the marshal asked to be killed. Muffled coughs are then heard, and it is revealed that Sawyer's shot missed the marshal's heart and pierced his lung, causing him more pain. Jack then euthanizes the marshal, presumably by suffocating him.|$|E

After two hours of asking him questions through his lawyer, James Dempsey, Mrs. Gaffney gave up. She was still unconvinced that Albert Fish was her son's killer.|$|E
25|$|Commander John Schenck {{was serving}} with the East India Squadron in June 1861 just before setting sail east {{to join the}} West Gulf Blockading Squadron. His last mission in the Far East was {{to proceed with the}} paddle steamer sloop USS Saginaw to Qui Nhon. A boat filled with sailors from the American {{merchant}} ship Myrtle was reported missing so Flag Officer Frederick K. Engle ordered Schenck to search the area. The Saginaw was armed with one 50-pounder (23kg), one 32-pounder (15kg) and two 24-pound rifled guns. She had a complement of fifty officers and enlisted men. Commander Schenck arrived off Qui Nhon of July 30 and prepared to enter the harbor the following day at 1:00 am. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the Vietnamese if they had seen the missing sailors. When the Saginaw was entering the harbor of Qui Nhon on July 31, the nearby fort to the north, mounting a few guns, opened fire at a range of 600 yards.|$|E

500|$|Gandingans {{were also}} used by {{a young man and}} woman who were having strong {{feelings}} for one another and if the feelings were just right, the couple would elope with one another. For instance, if the young man <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the young women “to come here,” the man would play on the gandingan, “Singkaden Ka Singkaden.” Another common message couples would play is, “Pagngapan ko seka,” literally meaning, “I am waiting for you.” ...|$|E

500|$|Manor Marussia's Alexander Rossi {{was delighted}} with his result in twelfth, {{feeling that it}} could be [...] "the start of great things", after he had equalled the team's best result of the season. Daniel Ricciardo called for the FIA to clear up the {{regulations}} of the virtual safety car, following him being overtaken easily at the first restart by Nico Rosberg, saying that he had not gotten a warning {{about the end of the}} period. Kimi Räikkönen was equally displeased, complaining about the rules concerning driving standards. Following his on-track battle with Max Verstappen, he demanded clarification on whether Verstappen's aggressive driving style was legal, saying: [...] "I just <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> if it's OK when you are next to another car, at some point on the exit of the corner are you allowed to always push the other car up on the kerbs [...] Apparently it's fine. As long as everybody has the same rules that's OK." [...] Concerning the collision between Nico Hülkenberg and Ricciardo, Force India revealed that damage to Hülkenberg's front wing had caused him to lose downforce and slide into the Red Bull. Following the turn one collision between their two drivers, Sauber's team principal Monisha Kaltenborn announced that she intended to [...] "have a word" [...] with her drivers, saying: [...] "The bottom line of this is that these kind of things simply must not happen. It is OK if you have decent and healthy competition which they do – both drivers are respectful to each other. [...] I'm upset. These mistakes shouldn't happen. We are much better than this." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1994, Joe Little {{was due to}} co-present an {{edition of}} the {{programme}} from the RTÉ studio in Castlebar, County Mayo, during the European Parliament election of that year, when it was realised belatedly {{that it could not}} be heard in Dublin. Disaster was prevented by mere minutes. When the IRA announced its cease-fire that same year, Joe Little was in the Belfast studio beginning an interview with the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, when the sound broke down live on air on a temporary basis. During one edition, the entire programme did malfunction, and, with interviews suspended and a commercial break impossible, Hanly intervened to prevent a complete disaster for several minutes by commenting to the show's previous guest: [...] "There was one other question I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you [...] ". Joe Little interviewed Lady Valerie Goulding to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of The Blitz of London by Germany.|$|E
2500|$|In 1903, Bradford invited tenders for the {{construction}} of Angram Reservoir, and the project was awarded to John Best in October–November, at a contract price of £365,492. Meanwhile, the Corporation had reached provisional agreement with the Nidd Valley Light Railway Company to purchase the powers awarded to them to build the light railway. There was some debate about the gauge of the railway. Bradford <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the Light Railway Commissioners for permission to increase it to , probably influenced by Best, who knew that there were supplies of suitable contractors stock available for such a railway. They also wanted to ensure that they bought enough land to allow a standard gauge railway to be constructed [...] "at any future time." [...] The North Eastern Railway, owners of the Nidd Valley Railway, argued that it should be standard gauge from the outset, since they were running excursions to Pateley Bridge twice a week, and these could continue over the Nidd Valley Light Railway. It would also remove the necessity of transshipping goods.|$|E

2500|$|In November 1962, Olivia died of measles {{encephalitis}} at age seven. Her death left Dahl [...] "limp with despair", {{and gave}} him a feeling of guilt that he could not do anything for her. Dahl subsequently became a proponent of immunisation and dedicated his 1982 book The BFG to his daughter. After Olivia's death, Dahl lost faith in God and viewed religion as a sham. While mourning her loss he had sought spiritual guidance from the former Archbishop of Canterbury Geoffrey Fisher, but became dismayed when Fisher told him that although Olivia was in Paradise, her beloved dog Rowley would never join her there, with Dahl recalling: [...] "I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him how he could be so absolutely sure that other creatures did not get the same special treatment as us.

2500|$|A {{few years}} later her friend Mary Hanford Ford related some of what took place meeting `Abdu'l-Bahá as a second hand account. A few facts are {{detailed}} - Farmer had met `Abdu'l-Bahá and accepted the religion on one occasion, and on another <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him {{a series of questions}} {{in the context of a}} review of her whole life - but when she wrote it all down she left the notebook in the hurry of being called to come to him in the early morning. She reported he answered the questions spontaneously and in the right order starting in such a way that the translator was confused because no question had been asked. At the end of that interview she cried [...] "…strange tears of ecstatic happiness, and went to her room to recover the composure which had been shaken by these surprising and illuminating events." [...] This list of questions is referred to in another briefer recollection. Anise Rideout had a similar record of the incident. Rideout reports that `Abdu'l-Bahá wrote an inscription in Farmer's Bible dated March 26. For Maria Wilson's part she also joined the religion and was the first Bahá'í to move to Boston.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 April 1932, the Lytton Commission {{arrived in}} Manchuria to begin its {{investigation}} to establish if Japan had committed aggression or not. Puyi {{was interviewed by}} Lord Lytton, and recalled thinking {{that at the time}} that he desperately <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Lytton for political asylum in Britain, but as General Itagaki was sitting right next to him at the meeting, he told Lytton that [...] "the masses of the people had begged me to come, that my stay here was absolutely voluntary and free". After the interview, Itagaki told Puyi: [...] "Your Excellency's manner was perfect; you spoke beautifully". The diplomat Wellington Koo, who was attached to the Lytton Commission as its Chinese assessor received a secret message saying that [...] "...a representative of the imperial household in Changchun wanted to see me and had a confidential message for me". The representative, posing as an antique dealer, who [...] "...told me he was sent by the Empress: She wanted me to help her escape from Changchun. He said she found life miserable there because she was surrounded in her house by Japanese maids. Every movement of hers was watched and reported". Koo said he was [...] "touched", but he could do nothing to help Wanrong escape, which her brother Rong Qi said was the [...] "final blow" [...] to her, leading her into a downward spiral. Right from the start, the Japanese occupation had sparked much resistance by guerrillas, whom the Kwantung Army called [...] "bandits". General Doihara was able for in exchange for a multi-million bribe to get one of the more prominent guerrilla leaders, the Hui Muslim general Ma Zhanshan to accept Japanese rule, and had Puyi appoint him Defense Minister. Much to the intense chagrin of Puyi and his Japanese masters, Ma's defection turned to be ruse, and only months after Puyi appointed him Defense Minister, Ma took his troops over the border to the Soviet Union to continue the struggle against the Japanese.|$|E

2500|$|Jobs and Apple {{became more}} successful, and his {{relationship}} with Brennan grew more complex. In 1977, the success of Apple was now {{a part of their}} relationship, [...] and Brennan, Daniel Kottke, and Jobs moved into a house near the Apple office in Cupertino. Brennan eventually took a position in the shipping department at Apple [...] Brennan's relationship with Jobs was deteriorating as his position with Apple grew, and she began to consider ending the relationship through small changes. In October 1977, Brennan was approached by Rod Holt, who asked her to take [...] "a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the Apples." [...] Both Holt and Jobs felt {{that it would be a}} good position for her, given her artistic abilities. Holt was particularly eager that she take the position and puzzled by her ambivalence toward it. Brennan's decision, however, was overshadowed by the fact that she realized she was pregnant and that Jobs was the father. It took her a few days to tell Jobs, whose face, according to Brennan [...] "turned ugly" [...] at the news. At the same time, according to Brennan, at the beginning of her third trimester, Jobs said to her: [...] "I never <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> that you get an abortion. I just didn't want to do that." [...] He also refused to discuss the pregnancy with her. Brennan herself felt confused about what to do. She was estranged from her mother and afraid to discuss the matter with her father. She also did not feel comfortable with the idea of having an abortion. She chose instead to discuss the matter with Kobun, who encouraged her to have and keep the baby, and pledged his support. Meanwhile, Holt was waiting for her decision on the internship. Brennan states that Jobs continued to encourage her to take the internship, stating she could [...] "be pregnant and work at Apple, you can take the job. I don't get what the problem is." [...] Brennan however notes that she [...] "felt so ashamed: the thought of my growing belly in the professional environment at Apple, with the child being his, while he was unpredictable, in turn being punishing and sentimentally ridiculous.
