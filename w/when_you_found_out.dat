500|$|Lawrence Taylor was {{the second}} of three sons born to Clarence and Iris Taylor in Williamsburg, Virginia. His father worked as a {{dispatcher}} at the Newport News shipyards, while {{his mother was a}} schoolteacher. Referred to as Lonnie by his family, Taylor was a mischievous youth. His mother said that [...] "e was a challenging child. Where the other two boys would ask for permission to do stuff, Lonnie...would just do it, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> about it, he would give you a big story." [...] Taylor concentrated on baseball as a youth, in which he played the position of catcher, and only began playing football at the advanced age of fifteen. He did not play organized high school football until the following year (eleventh grade), and was not heavily recruited coming out of high school.|$|E
6000|$|... "They tell me that,--that {{you did not}} behave wisely about it. Why {{could you}} not let her alone <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> how matters were going?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet you tore up my cheque {{and flung}} {{yourself}} away <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that my standard of morals {{was not quite}} what you had expected," [...] she murmured. [...] "Haven't you got over that quixoticism a little, Leonard?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see I've got to talk," [...] said Lister. [...] "Shillito was a cheat, but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> him <b>out</b> <b>you</b> {{tried to}} jump off the train. You let me help because I think you trusted me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here is {{a dollar}} for yourself," [...] Vincent said, [...] "and another {{to give to}} any of the men who can give <b>you</b> the news. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> have <b>found</b> <b>out</b> come and tell me. Here is my card and address." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All this, and I {{not knowing}} it!" [...] murmured Thomasin in an awestruck tone. [...] "Terrible! What {{could have made}} her--O, Eustacia! And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> it <b>out</b> <b>you</b> went in hot haste to her? Were you too cruel?--or is she really so wicked as she seems?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rabbits, ribbons, sweetmeats, goldfish, {{rolls of}} {{coloured}} paper," [...] said the reverend gentleman with rapidity. [...] "Didn't {{you see it}} all <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> the faked ropes? It's just {{the same with the}} sword. Mr Todhunter hasn't got a scratch on him, as you say; but he's got a scratch in him, if you follow me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mrs. Barker, [...] "and I {{hope your}} friend Stacy remembered that but for ME, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> {{that you were}} not rich, you'd have given up the claim, but that I really deceived my own father to make you keep it. I've often worried over that, George," [...] she said pensively, turning a diamond {{bracelet}} around her pretty wrist, [...] "although I never said anything about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{used to be}} {{perfectly}} crazy about his plays. Don't you think 'Hamlet' is splendid? We had ever so much about Shakespeare. Weren't you perfectly astonished <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> how many other plays of his there were? I always thought {{there was nothing but}} 'Hamlet' and 'Romeo and Juliet' and 'Macbeth' and 'Richard III.' and 'King Lear,' and that one that Robeson and Crane have--oh yes! 'Comedy of Errors.'" ...|$|E
60|$|HECTOR. Oh, don't explain. We understand. You have {{a couple}} of {{thousand}} pounds in exchequer bills, 50,000 shares worth tenpence a dozen, and half a dozen tabloids of cyanide of potassium to poison yourself with <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are <b>found</b> <b>out.</b> That's the reality of your millions.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{trying to}} be just to you and Jim," [...] Dick resumed. [...] "I have shirked my duty; I trusted <b>you,</b> Lance, and <b>when</b> I <b>found</b> <b>you</b> <b>out</b> it hurt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very good,' said he, {{taking his}} hat from its peg, and putting {{a pair of}} {{handcuffs}} in his pocket {{as if they were}} his gloves. 'Reserve!' Reserve saluted. 'You know where to find me?' Reserve again saluted. 'Riderhood, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>found</b> <b>out</b> concerning his coming home, come round to the window of Cosy, tap twice at it, and wait for me. Now, gentlemen.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hello, Father, you see I didn't {{waste any}} time," [...] he cried; {{grasping}} his father's {{hand in a}} grip that made Mr. Worthington wince. [...] "Well, you are a trump, after all. We're both a little hot-headed, I guess, and do things we're sorry for,--but that's all over now, isn't it? I'm sorry. I might have known you'd come round <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> for yourself {{what kind of a}} girl Cynthia was. Did you ever see anybody like her?" ...|$|E
60|$|VIOLET. [flushing with indignation] Oh! You think me {{a wicked}} woman, like the rest. You think I {{have not only}} been vile, but that I share your abominable opinions. Miss Ramsden: I have borne your hard words because I knew you would be sorry for them <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> the truth. But I won't bear such a horrible insult as to be complimented by Jack on {{being one of the}} wretches of whom he approves. I have kept my {{marriage}} a secret for my husband's sake. But now I claim my right as a married woman not to be insulted.|$|E
6000|$|Her eyes bravely searched his. [...] "Was {{that why}} you {{did not come to}} say good-bye to us?" [...] His glance fell in a wish that she had been less cruelly direct. She went on: [...] "You needn't answer. I'm used to being treated that way. I knew {{somebody}} had told you I was a medium. You despised me <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> about me--everybody does, except those who want to use me. All the people I really want to know go by on the other side as if I were a leper. It was so in Boston; {{it is going to be}} the same here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do, Tom. You hit {{the truth}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> said they <b>found</b> <b>out</b> they couldn't do {{anything}} at the farm, and couldn't reach Mrs. Stanhope and Mrs. Laning. The only things left were {{to try to}} reach us or the girls." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you {{remember}} what you said, after she had followed you to Browndown? I mean, after she had declared {{that you would have}} fallen in love with my brother if you had met him first--and after Nugent (at her instigation no doubt) had taken advantage of your blindness to make you believe that you were speaking to me. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> were smarting under the insult, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> had <b>found</b> <b>out</b> the trick, what did you say? ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{referred}} to the confession. Two passages in it were underlined: [...] "The wickedness in me, on which Mrs. Gallilee calculated, may be in me still." [...] And, again: [...] "Even now, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>found</b> me <b>out,</b> I love him. Don't trust me." ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{this moment}} the word [...] "Asaph" [...] {{came from the}} house in tones shriller and sharper and higher than any {{in which he had}} ever heard it {{pronounced}} before. He sprang to his feet and went to the house. His sister took him into the parlor and shut the door. Her eyes were red and her face was pale. [...] "Asaph," [...] said she, [...] "Mr. Rooper has told me the whole of your infamous conduct. Now I know what you meant when you said that you were making arrangements to get clothes. You were going to sell me for them. And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that I was likely to marry Doctor Wicker, you put up your price and wanted a dictionary and a pipe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not exactly that, Mr. Rushbrook," [...] she said, fixing her {{beautiful}} {{eyes on him}} in bright and trustful confidence, [...] "but I {{happen to have a}} fuller knowledge of this business than he has, and yet, as it is not altogether my own secret, I was not permitted to divulge it to him. Nor would I tell it to you, only I cannot bear that you should think that I {{had anything to do with}} this wretched inquisition into Mr. Somers's prospects. Knowing as well as you do how perfectly independent I am, you would think it strange, wouldn't you? But you would think it still more surprising <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that I and my uncle already know how liberally and generously you had provided for Mr. Somers in the future." ...|$|E
5000|$|On June 13, 2016, Cox {{spoke at}} a vigil in Salt Lake City honoring those {{who died in the}} Orlando nightclub {{shooting}} the day before. He surprised many when he apologized for mistreating schoolmates and his lack of support for the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender community. He aimed part of his speech at the [...] "straight community": How did you feel when you heard that 49 people had been gunned down by a self-proclaimed terrorist? Thatâ€™s the easy question. Here is the hard one: Did that feeling change <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> the shooting was at a gay bar at 2 a.m. in the morning? If that feeling changed, then we are doing something wrong.|$|E
6000|$|Uncle Ben nodded. [...] "And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> hev <b>found</b> <b>out</b> and you're {{settled in}} your mind that you kin make my mind easy about this yer Lou Price, ez we'll call her, bein' {{divorced}} squarely, and bein', so to speak, in the way o' gettin' married agin, ye might let me know ez a friend. I reckon I won't trouble you any more to-night--onless you and me takes another sociable drink together in the bar. No? Well, then, good-night." [...] He moved slowly towards the door. With his hand on the lock he added: [...] "Ef yer writin' to her agin, you might say ez how <b>you</b> <b>found</b> ME lookin' well and comf'able, and hopin' she's enjyin' the same blessin'. 'So long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good!" [...] {{the general}} said, {{when he had}} finished. [...] "Your {{calculations}} were all well founded; but, of course, you could not calculate on Soult's night march across the Catalena hills, and, as you knew nothing of the whereabouts of Beresford and Silveira, you {{had good reason to}} suppose that Soult would continue his march up the valley of the Tamega to Chaves. That was the only mistake you committed, and an older soldier might well have fallen into the same error. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> had <b>found</b> <b>out</b> your mistake, <b>you</b> acted promptly, and could not have done better than to proceed to Salamende. You did well to destroy both bridges, and to place half your force to defend the passage here, for you naturally supposed, as I supposed myself, that Soult would follow this road down to Chaves.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pray, madam," [...] said my lord, {{interrupting}} me, [...] "I do {{not find}} that you kept up to your resolutions <b>when</b> <b>you</b> got there; you were so far from doing your duty as a parent, that you even neglected the civility of acquaintances, for they would have asked after them, but your whole scheme has been to conceal yourself as much as possible, and even <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were <b>found</b> <b>out,</b> denied yourself, as witness the case of your daughter here. As {{to the character of}} Lady Roxana, which you so nicely managed," [...] said he, [...] "did that become a woman that had five children, whose necessity had obliged you to leave them, to live in a continual scene of pageantry and riot, I could almost say debauchery? Look into your conduct, and see if you deserve to have the title or the estate you now so happily enjoy." ...|$|R
5000|$|During {{her time}} at Fox Sports, another {{controversy}} occurred on Sunday, October 26, 2008. While {{working as a}} sideline reporter, Sargent was conducting a taped, pre-game interview with the new {{head coach of the}} San Francisco 49ers, Mike Singletary, and said, [...] "I heard that your mentor, Bill Walsh, {{was one of the first}} phone calls that you made <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that you had the job. What does it mean to you to be the head coach of the 49ers?" [...] The interview was abruptly halted when the reporter was informed by her producers that Walsh had died on July 30, 2007. The unauthorized video was never aired on the game broadcast, but did air on Mike Francesaâ€™s WNBC-TV/Channel 4 program, Mikeâ€™d Up.|$|E

40|$|What was {{the first}} thing you did <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>found</b> <b>out</b> that you were HIV positive? I was in a {{combination}} of shock and denial. If it weren't for the mixed emotions, I would have probably cried. I believe that I did cry eventually. I had been sitting in this nurse's office waiting for a while, thinking that it shouldn't be taking this long. Then, I realized that I already knew that I was HIV positive. The nurse who took my blood two weeks before came into the small office, said hello without looking at me and sat at the desk. He put my file on the desk, sat in the swivel chair and turned to face me. He smiled; I smiled. I could tell from the way he was acting that he wasn't going to tell me anything that I didn't already know. Finally, after listening to his well-rehearsed lines about sex, safer sex, my limited treatment options (in November of 1990) and whether or not I had any questions, I was in a daze. So, the first thing I did when I found out that I was HIV positive was walk out of the walk-in clinic...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Waddle {{had hardly}} been silenced, {{and had just}} retired with melancholy {{diligence}} amidst the records of unsatisfactory commercial transactions, before Ralph Newton again entered the shop. He shook hands with Mr. Neefit,--as was the practice with many favourite customers,--and immediately {{went to work in}} regard to his new order, as though every Christmas and every Midsummer saw an account closed on his behalf in Mr. Neefit's books. [...] "I did say just now, <b>when</b> I <b>found</b> <b>you</b> were <b>out,</b> that last year's lines would do; but it may be, you know, that I'm running a little to flesh." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'With {{the same}} sincerity, I warn {{you that the}} wickedness in me, on which Mrs. Gallilee calculated, may be in me still. The {{influence}} of your higher and better nature--helped perhaps by that other influence of which the old priest spoke in his letter--has opened my heart to tenderness and penitence of which I never believed myself capable: has brought the burning tears into my eyes which make it a hard task to write to you. All this I know, and yet I dare not believe in myself. It is useless to deny it, Carmina--I love him. Even now, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>found</b> me <b>out,</b> I love him. Don't trust me. Oh, God, what torture it is to write it--but I do write it, I will write it--don't trust me! ...|$|R
6000|$|While Mr. Pleydell {{was thus}} vaunting his {{knowledge}} of his profession, the waiter reentered with Mr. Driver, his mouth still greasy with mutton pies, and the froth of the last draught of twopenny yet unsubsided on his upper lip, with such speed had he obeyed the commands of his principal. 'Driver, you must go instantly and find out {{the woman who was}} old Mrs. Margaret Bertram's maid. Inquire for her everywhere, but if you find it necessary to have recourse to Protocol, Quid the tobacconist, or any other of these folks, you will take care not to appear yourself, but send some woman of your acquaintance; I daresay you know enough that may be so condescending as to oblige <b>you.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> have <b>found</b> her <b>out,</b> engage her to come to my chambers tomorrow at eight o'clock precisely.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, my dear girl, I {{hope you}} will prosper. One thing above all [...] others you'll have to mind, {{and it is that}} folk must {{continually}} [...] strain to advance in order to remain where they are: and you [...] particularly. But as for trying too hard, I wouldn't do it. Much [...] lies in minding this, that your best plan for lightness of heart is to [...] raise yourself a little higher than your old mates, but not so high as [...] to be quite out of their reach. All human beings enjoy themselves [...] from the outside, and so getting on a little has this good in it, you [...] still keep in your old class where your feelings are, and are [...] thoughtfully treated by this class: while by getting on too much you [...] are sneered at by your new acquaintance, who don't know the skill of [...] your rise, and you are parted from and forgot by the old ones who do. [...] Whatever happens, don't be too quick to feel. You will surely get [...] some hard blows <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are <b>found</b> <b>out,</b> for if the great can find no [...] excuse for hitting with a mind, they'll do it and say 'twas in fun.

It is such men as these that provoke the contempt we get.
