50|$|For the BMR, most of {{the energy}} <b>is</b> <b>consumed</b> in {{maintaining}} fluid levels in tissues through osmoregulation, and only about one-tenth <b>is</b> <b>consumed</b> for mechanical work, such as digestion, heartbeat, and breathing.|$|R
5|$|As the {{pressure}} was released by the cabin rupture, the convective rush of air caused the flames to spread across the cabin, beginning the second phase. The third phase began {{when most of the}} oxygen <b>was</b> <b>consumed</b> and was replaced with atmospheric air, essentially quenching the fire, but causing high concentrations of carbon monoxide and heavy smoke to fill the cabin, and large amounts of soot to be deposited on surfaces as they cooled.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{had been}} mined at Bradford {{since at least}} the early 17th century, when the area around the pits was largely rural; it became {{increasingly}} built-up and industrialised as nearby Manchester expanded during the 19th century. Coal was transported from the colliery by canal and railway, but most <b>was</b> <b>consumed</b> locally by the adjacent Bradford Ironworks. In the mid-20th century a 469-yard (420 m) underground tunnel was dug to supply coal directly to the Stuart Street Power Station.|$|E
5|$|Craig and Sophie {{thank the}} Doctor, Craig {{giving him a}} spare set of keys in case he ever needs it. Aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor directs Amy to write the note {{that led him to}} Craig's house, using a red pen in his jacket; she rummages around and finds the {{engagement}} ring from her husband-to-be, Rory, whom she had forgotten after he <b>was</b> <b>consumed</b> by the crack in space and time and erased from existence. A similar crack appears behind Craig's refrigerator, and widens.|$|E
50|$|Cheese and {{crackers}} has <b>been</b> <b>consumed</b> by various sailors such as immigrants, whalers and explorers before refrigeration existed, using hardtack crackers and cheese. It has also <b>been</b> <b>consumed</b> by various land explorers.|$|R
50|$|Ptarmigan, grouse, crow blackbirds, dove, {{ducks and}} other game fowl <b>are</b> <b>consumed</b> in the United States. In the American state of Arkansas, beaver tail stew <b>is</b> <b>consumed</b> in Cotton town. Squirrel, raccoon, possum, bear, muskrat, chipmunk, skunk, groundhog, pheasant, {{armadillo}} and rabbit <b>are</b> also <b>consumed</b> in the United States.|$|R
50|$|In certain {{regions of}} South East Asia, {{the leaves and}} young shoots <b>are</b> <b>consumed</b> as vegetables. in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, the leaves, flowers and tender stems <b>are</b> <b>consumed</b> as vegetables.|$|R
5|$|Despairing of any siege {{operation}} {{against the}} Temple's massive walls, Titus had the gates burnt down. At the ensuing council of war, {{when it was}} debated whether to destroy the entire Temple, Alexander voted with the majority who favored preservation. In the event, this made no difference; as the fighting raged on the following day, a Roman soldier hurled a burning brand into a chamber of the Temple itself. The Temple <b>was</b> <b>consumed</b> by the flames.|$|E
5|$|Egan and the {{trustees}} of St. Mary's established a singing school in 1804, {{with the goal}} of improving the quality of the choir there. The following year <b>was</b> <b>consumed</b> by another yellow fever outbreak, and Egan joined John Rossiter, the pastor of another of Philadelphia's four Catholic churches, St. Joseph's, in ministering to the sick. In 1806, they worked with the parishioners of a third church, Holy Trinity, to found an orphanage, as the problem of orphaned children had been made worse by the yellow fever deaths.|$|E
5|$|Images of the First and Second Doctors are {{displayed}} on the Doctor's mirror device and printout from the TARDIS' typewriter. The episode presents these trips as the Doctor's compensation to Amy for her fiancé Rory Williams' death in the previous episode, which Amy herself does not remember since Rory <b>was</b> <b>consumed</b> by {{a crack in the}} universe and thus erased from time. Van Gogh is able to sense Amy's sadness at Rory's death, and the Doctor later accidentally addresses Amy and Vincent as Amy and Rory, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Food that {{contains}} only pareve ingredients but {{that comes in}} contact with dairy or meat dishes in the home or that is manufactured on equipment also used to manufacture dairy or meat equipment maintains the status of pareve, and may <b>be</b> <b>consumed</b> after eating dairy or meat. However, if such contact is made, it may only <b>be</b> <b>consumed</b> on dairy or meat dishes respectively. Some commercial products that are pareve but have been manufactured on dairy equipment bear the letters DE after the hechscher to let the consumer know the product cannot <b>be</b> <b>consumed</b> together with meat. Still, such an item can <b>be</b> <b>consumed</b> after a meat meal.|$|R
50|$|Solanum macrocarpon <b>is</b> <b>consumed</b> in {{the various}} {{regions of the world}} where it is found.

25|$|Dogs <b>are</b> <b>consumed</b> in China, South Korea and Vietnam. Dogs {{are also}} {{occasionally}} eaten in the Arctic regions. Historically, dog meat has <b>been</b> <b>consumed</b> in various {{part of the}} world, such as Hawaii, Japan, Switzerland and Mexico.|$|R
5|$|Roughly {{one quarter}} of all zinc output in the United States in 2009 <b>was</b> <b>consumed</b> in zinc compounds; a variety of which are used industrially. Zinc oxide is widely used as a white pigment in paints and as a {{catalyst}} {{in the manufacture of}} rubber to disburse heat. Zinc oxide is used to protect rubber polymers and plastics from ultraviolet radiation (UV). The semiconductor properties of zinc oxide make it useful in varistors and photocopying products. The zinc zinc-oxide cycle is a two step thermochemical process based on zinc and zinc oxide for hydrogen production.|$|E
5|$|The puffball is edible {{when the}} gleba is still firm and white. They are {{reportedly}} {{consumed by the}} tribal people of Madhya Pradesh. In Mexico, a large collection <b>was</b> <b>consumed</b> by several people who confused the species with Calvatia, a puffball genus containing popular edible members. Of the five who ate the fungus, two had gastrointestinal symptoms including stomachache, flatulence, and diarrhea; the other three did not have symptoms. The large European bird great bustard (Otis tarda) has been recorded feeding on the puffball.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, {{following}} the death of his mother, Jack tracks down the now-retired Ross, and kills him in a duel. The fates of Marston's companions are later summarized: Marshal Leigh Johnson retired from Armadillo and moved away; Reyes <b>was</b> <b>consumed</b> by power and became a tyrant; Bonnie MacFarlane eventually married; Irish shot himself dead in an outhouse when his gun accidentally discharged; Seth Briars eventually found treasure and became rich; and Landon Ricketts died quietly in his sleep.|$|E

50|$|Trophic {{dynamics}} {{refers to}} process {{of energy and}} nutrient transfer between organisms. Trophic dynamics {{is an important part}} of the structure and function of ecosystems. Figure 3 shows energy transferred for an ecosystem at Silver Springs, Florida. Energy gained by primary producers (plants, P) <b>is</b> <b>consumed</b> by herbivores (H), which <b>are</b> <b>consumed</b> by carnivores (C), which <b>are</b> themselves <b>consumed</b> by “top- carnivores”(TC).|$|R
30|$|The {{different}} modes {{can meet the}} identified monitoring requirements, {{while at the same}} time taking care of the energy consumption: most energy <b>is</b> <b>consumed</b> when the container is sealed, less energy <b>is</b> <b>consumed</b> when the container is empty, and least energy can <b>be</b> <b>consumed</b> when the container is on a vessel and cannot be accessed until arrival of the vessel. Also note that at all times, when no UMTS/GPRS or GPS communication is required, the respective modules are turned off.|$|R
5|$|Cunningham was {{promoted}} to flight lieutenant on 12 March 1940. In April 1940 the squadron flew as escort for a De Havilland Flamingo carrying Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, to Paris to attend a meeting after the German invasion of Denmark and Norway. Most of the unit's time during the Phoney War <b>was</b> <b>consumed</b> engaging in intensive training over the Wash which included co-operation with searchlights and mine-laying operations. It did not last for long. On 15 May 1940, 604 relocated to RAF Manston. From the airfield Cunningham flew sorties over the English Channel and patrols over Dunkirk as the Battle for France intensified. Cunningham made no recorded contact with the enemy and France capitulated on 25 June 1940.|$|E
5|$|Foresters and ecologists {{argue that}} large {{controlled}} burns in Yellowstone {{prior to the}} fires would not have greatly reduced the area that <b>was</b> <b>consumed</b> in 1988. Controlled burns would quickly become uncontrolled if {{they were allowed to}} burn with the intensity that many tree and plant communities need for proper regeneration. Consequently, natural fires, rather than controlled burns, are the park's primary maintenance tool. Since the late 1970s, some 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn themselves out. In rare circumstances, natural fires are supplemented by controlled burns that are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood fuel is consumed.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to game, mutton <b>was</b> <b>consumed</b> {{from time to}} time. Keeping sheep provided wool to the household, and when a sheep reached an age when it was unsuitable for wool production, it could be harvested as mutton. Sheep were originally introduced to the Americas through the Spanish in Florida. In the north, the Dutch and English also introduced several varieties of sheep. The casual English practice of animal husbandry allowed sheep to roam free, consuming a variety of forage. Foragebased diets produce meat with a characteristically strong, gamey flavor and a tough consistency, which requires aging and slow cooking to tenderize.|$|E

50|$|The {{marginal}} {{propensity to}} <b>consume</b> (MPC) <b>is</b> {{the fraction of}} a change in disposable income that <b>is</b> <b>consumed.</b> For example, if disposable income rises by $100, and $65 of that $100 <b>is</b> <b>consumed,</b> the MPC <b>is</b> 65%. Restated, the marginal propensity to save is 35%.|$|R
50|$|Turkey {{does have}} {{sufficient}} water. Almost {{three quarters of}} water that <b>is</b> <b>consumed</b> <b>is</b> used for irrigation in agriculture.|$|R
5|$|In modern times, {{water is}} seen as a common choice to drink with a meal. In the Middle Ages, however, {{concerns}} over purity, medical recommendations and its low prestige value made it less favored, and alcoholic beverages were always preferred. They were seen as more nutritious and beneficial to digestion than water, with the invaluable bonus of being less prone to putrefaction due to the alcohol content. Wine <b>was</b> <b>consumed</b> on a daily basis in most of France and all over the Western Mediterranean wherever grapes were cultivated. Further north it remained the preferred drink of the bourgeoisie and the nobility who could afford it, and far less common among peasants and workers. The drink of commoners in the northern parts of the continent was primarily beer or ale.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of small installations, {{convenience}} may outweigh cost. There is {{a wide range of}} small machines designed to be used in offices that produce a few litres of drinking water from the atmosphere. However, there are circumstances where there really is no source of water other than the atmosphere. For example, in the 1930s, American designers added condenser systems to airships– in this case the air was that emitted by the exhaust of the engines, and so it contained additional water as a product of combustion. The moisture was collected and used as additional ballast to compensate for the loss of weight as fuel <b>was</b> <b>consumed.</b> By collecting ballast in this way, the airship's buoyancy could be kept relatively constant without having to release helium gas, which was both expensive and in limited supply.|$|E
5|$|Richard D'Oyly Carte's opera {{companies}} (of {{which there}} were often several playing simultaneously) usually programmed Trial by Jury as a companion piece to The Sorcerer or H.M.S. Pinafore. In the 1884–85 London production, a transformation scene was added at the end, in which the Judge and Plaintiff became the Harlequinade characters Harlequin and Columbine and the set <b>was</b> <b>consumed</b> by red fire and flames. From 1894, the year when the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company established a year-round touring company that had most of the Gilbert and Sullivan works in its repertory, Trial by Jury was always included, except for 190103, and then again from 194346, when the company played a reduced repertory during World War II. From 1919, costumes were by Percy Anderson, and a new touring set was designed by Peter Goffin in 1957.|$|E
