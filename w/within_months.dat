40|$|No {{data are}} {{currently}} {{available on the}} role of oral sirolimus in the prevention of recurrent stenosis in the periphery. We report the effects of oral sirolimus in the prevention of recurrent infrainguinal obstructions in patients with complex peripheral arterial disease. Three patients with ischemic rest pain of the lower limbs and repeated short-term need for surgical and/or endovascular revascularization: 9 times <b>within</b> 12 <b>months,</b> 7 times <b>within</b> 15 <b>months,</b> 11 times <b>within</b> 26 <b>months,</b> respectively. Oral sirolimus on a case by case basis, resulted in less frequent restenosis and longer intervention-free intervals: three re-interventions <b>within</b> 37 <b>months</b> in the first patient, one balloon angioplasty <b>within</b> 17 <b>months</b> in the second, and three re-interventions <b>within</b> 21 <b>months</b> in the third patient, respectively. Side effects, in particular dyspepsia and diarrhoea, were mild and tolerable. To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that oral sirolimus was successfully administered in patients with recurrent excessive neointimal proliferation after revascularization of peripheral arterial lesions lowering the necessity of re-intervention and hence prolonging intervention-free intervals...|$|R

5|$|AC/DC {{underwent}} several line-up changes before releasing {{their first}} album, High Voltage, in 1975.

Ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was auditioned and selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released the new album, Back in Black, which was made as a tribute to Bon Scott. The album launched them to new heights of success and became their all-time best-seller.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in the 1840s, European {{settlers}} cleared vast {{tracts of}} land for farming and grazing, further reducing kakapo habitat. They brought more dogs and other mammalian predators, including domestic cats, black rats and stoats. Europeans knew little of the kakapo until George Gray of the British Museum described it from a skin in 1845. As the Māori had done, early European explorers and their dogs ate kakapo. In the late 19th century, the kakapo became well known as a scientific curiosity, and thousands were captured or killed for zoos, museums and collectors. Most captured specimens died <b>within</b> <b>months.</b> From at least the 1870s, collectors knew the kakapo population was declining; their prime concern was to collect {{as many as possible}} before the bird became extinct.|$|E

Ramsay MacDonald became the first Labour Prime Minister, but the Labour government fell <b>within</b> <b>months,</b> necessitating another general election. By a margin of only 77 votes, Chamberlain narrowly defeated Labour candidate Oswald Mosley (who later led the British Union of Fascists). Believing he would lose if he stood again in Ladywood, Chamberlain arranged to be adopted for Birmingham Edgbaston, the district of the city {{where he was born}} and which was a much safer seat which he would hold {{for the rest of his}} life. The Unionists won the election, but Chamberlain declined to serve again as Chancellor, preferring his former position as Minister of Health.|$|E
