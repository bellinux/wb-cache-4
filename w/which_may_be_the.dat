5|$|A {{permanent}} {{exhibit of}} {{items from the}} Collections is {{on display in the}} British Library entrance area upper ground floor, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> best gallery of diverse classic stamps and philatelic material in the world. Approximately 80,000 items on 6,000 sheets may be viewed in 1,000 display frames; 2,400 sheets are from the Tapling Collection. Other material, which covers the whole world, is available to students and researchers by appointment.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, {{some enzymes}} display enzyme promiscuity, having broad {{specificity}} and {{acting on a}} range of different physiologically relevant substrates. Many enzymes possess small side activities which arose fortuitously (i.e. neutrally), <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> starting point for the evolutionary selection of a new function.|$|E
5|$|Inside {{the walls}} the tower {{included}} a crypt chapel, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> {{site of a}} previous church. The crypt chapel originally had a nave, chancel and an apsidal sanctuary. It is a typical early Norman design with solid pillars and arches. In 1074 D'Oyly and his close friend, Roger d'Ivry endowed a chapel with a college of priests. At an early stage it acquired a dedication to Saint George.|$|E

5|$|Burial customs, {{at least}} in {{southern}} Poland, included raising kurgans. The urn with the ashes {{was placed on the}} mound or on a post thrust into the ground. In that position, few such urns survived, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> reason why Slavic burial sites in Poland are rare. All dead, regardless of social status, were cremated and afforded a burial, according to Arab testimonies (one {{from the end of the}} 9th century and another one from about 930). A Slavic funeral feast practice was also mentioned earlier by Theophylact Simocatta.|$|E
5|$|D. longus is {{displayed}} the Senckenberg Museum in Frankfurt (a skeleton {{made up of}} several specimens, donated in 1907 by the American Museum of Natural History), Germany. A mounted and more complete skeleton of D. longus is at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, DC, while a mounted skeleton of D. hallorum (formerly Seismosaurus), <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> same as D. longus, {{can be found at}} the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science.|$|E
5|$|Structure 12 lies to {{the east}} of Structure11. It has also been {{excavated}} and, like Structure11, it is covered with rounded boulders held together with clay. It lies {{to the east}} of the plaza in the southern area of the Central Group. The structure is a three-tiered platform with stairways on the east and west sides. The visible remains date to the Early Classic but they overlie Late Preclassic construction. A row of sculptures lines {{the west side of the}} structure, including six monuments, a stela and an altar. Further monuments line the east side, one of <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> head of a crocodilian, the others are plain. Sculpture69 is located on the south side of the structure.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of Acrocanthosaurus in the Cloverly Formation {{was established in}} 2012 with the description of another partial skeleton, UM20796. This specimen, consisting of parts of two vertebrae, partial pubic bones, a femur, a partial fibula, and fragments, represents a juvenile animal. It came from a bonebed in the Bighorn Basin of north-central Wyoming, and was found near the shoulder blade of a Sauroposeidon. An assortment of other fragmentary theropod remains from the formation may also belong to Acrocanthosaurus, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> only large theropod in the Cloverly Formation.|$|E
5|$|Scientists have {{recognized}} {{two classes of}} geological feature on Oberon: craters and chasmata ('canyons'—deep, elongated, steep-sided depressions which would probably be described as rift valleys or escarpments if on Earth). Oberon's surface is the most heavily cratered of all the Uranian moons, with a crater density approaching saturation—when the formation of new craters is balanced by destruction of old ones. This high number of craters indicates that Oberon has the most ancient surface among Uranus's moons. The crater diameters range up to 206 kilometers for the largest known crater, Hamlet. Many large craters are surrounded by bright impact ejecta (rays) consisting of relatively fresh ice. The largest craters, Hamlet, Othello and Macbeth, have floors made of a very dark material deposited after their formation. A peak with a height of about 11km was observed in some Voyager images near the south-eastern limb of Oberon, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> central peak of a large impact basin with a diameter of about 375km. Oberon's surface is intersected by a system of canyons, which, however, are less widespread than those found on Titania. The canyons' sides are probably scarps produced by normal faults which can be either old or fresh: the latter transect the bright deposits of some large craters, indicating that they formed later. The most prominent Oberonian canyon is Mommur Chasma.|$|E

Often a hybrid algorithm will provide the best performance, due to this tradeoff changing with size.|$|E

25|$|Most mammary {{tumors in}} mice are adenocarcinomas. They {{can be caused}} by viral infection. Recurrence rates are high, and {{therefore}} there is a poor prognosis. There is frequently local tissue invasion and metastasis to the lungs. A well known tumor virus of the mouse is the mouse mammary tumor virus, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most common cause of this tumor in mice.|$|E
25|$|Born in Chelsea, Massachusetts, of Italian heritage, Marden went by {{the name}} Louis Paragallo {{while growing up in}} nearby Quincy. Marden was {{introduced}} to photography at a chemistry class while attending Quincy Senior High School. His interest was intense and lasting. In 1932, at the age of 19, he wrote a book called Color Photography with the Miniature Camera, <b>which</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first book ever published on 35mm color photography.|$|E
