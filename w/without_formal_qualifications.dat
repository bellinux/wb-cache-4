We find that differences in individual characteristics can explain a substantial proportion of the Mäorinon-Mäori differences in labour market outcomes (and, in 1981 and 1986, all of it for women). The beneficial effect of education is substantially larger for Mäori than for non-Mäori, putting an exceptionally high penalty on the majority of Mäori who are <b>without</b> <b>formal</b> <b>qualifications...</b>|$|E
30|$|Immigration {{policy is}} an {{important}} part of UK Government policy, which continues to be under close interest and scrutiny by the UK press and population. Entrepreneurship visas are seen to be means to attract individuals from countries from outside Europe, who can contribute to the social and economic development of the UK. Whilst much emphasis on immigration is on the existing qualifications and skills (Hunt, 2010), our study shows that the unique characteristics of online home-based businesses can allow individuals with drive and creativity, but <b>without</b> <b>formal</b> <b>qualifications,</b> to operate entrepreneurial businesses, suggesting policy should find ways of moving beyond the emphasis on formal qualifications for the allocation of visa. Similarly, in order to support ethnic entrepreneurs in the UK, or moving to the UK, resources should be invested in increasing the awareness of online home-businesses, providing relevant technical and business education and training, and improving national infrastructure such as broadband access.|$|E

30|$|Our {{conclusions}} therefore are as follows: Entering the German {{labour market}} <b>without</b> <b>formal</b> vocational <b>qualifications</b> is risky. Employers seem {{to rely on}} these signals when they screen potential candidates for a vacancy {{and the risk of}} unemployment or unstable employment is considerably higher <b>without</b> a <b>formal</b> vocational <b>qualification.</b> Regarding this, vocational training indeed is a safety net in case of drop out. On the other hand, we also observe that among the successful candidates only a completed higher education degree is associated with (clearly) higher status scores, whereas we do not find large differences between dropouts with and without pre-tertiary vocational qualifications and candidates who never entered higher education. At first sight, it thus does not seem to matter which route into stable employment was taken, because detours and vocational qualifications do not make a difference regarding occupational status. Still, the reasons for the non-existent labour market disadvantages of the dropouts are to be examined.|$|R

30|$|With {{respect to}} labour market {{activation}} and young people, the research highlights the drastic situation faced by unemployed youths. Thus, the findings emphasise {{the importance of}} implementing the Youth Guarantee. Nevertheless, {{the scale of the}} unemployment problem in Ireland and the associated strain on resources implies that a much more scaled down version of the Guarantee will be implemented to what was initially envisaged. Specifically, claimants under the age of 18 who leave school <b>without</b> <b>formal</b> <b>qualifications</b> will be offered a “second chance” education place outside the school system; however, this aspect of the Guarantee will not be fully operational until the end of 2015. Claimants aged between 18 and 24 will be categorised as high and low risk {{on the basis of the}} country’s profiling system. Under this system, each new claimant is asked a series of questions on making a claim for unemployment benefit, and a probability of exit to the labour market (PEX) score is calculated. Individuals with a low PEX will be deemed high risk. High risk claimants will only receive an intervention after four months on the Live Register, while the waiting time for medium- to high-risk claimants will be nine months. It is likely that such relatively low intensity interventions will have limited impact on the transition rates of young claimants to unemployment.|$|E

Befriended by King James I and his son who succeeded him, he became chancellor to Queen Henrietta and was knighted by King James I on 21 October 1623 and appointed to the Privy Council. At one time, he even spent a brief time in prison, but he later became {{a founding member of the}} Royal Society and published two major philosophical treatises as well as a popular cookbook. He designed and manufactured wine bottles with tapered necks for simpler pouring and square sides for easy stacking. He dabbled in mathematics and corresponded with Fermat of ‘Last Theorem’ fame. In 1641, he challenged a French nobleman who publicly cast a slur on the British King to a ‘digladiation’ (a sword duel) and quickly dispatched him. He was a friend and admirer of Sir Thomas Browne whose ‘Religio Medici’ he helped to publish. The Cowlishaw Library holds a 1659 5 th edition copy of this remarkable book, with Digby 2 ̆ 7 s name on the spine. Truly, Digby must qualify as a Renaissance man...|$|E
40|$|At {{the start}} of the year 2005 the Social Code II came into force in Germany. The reform {{introduced}} a unified means-tested benefit, the unemployment benefit II, for employable people who live in needy households. Prior to this reform they could have either received unemployment assistance benefit or (with little or no employment history) social benefit. A major goal of the reform is the integration of needy but employable people into the labour market. We regard two policies that aim at achieving this goal: (short-term) training programmes and the assignment to private placement services. The study relies on a large administrative data set of unemployment benefit II recipients. With probit models we investigate the individual determinants of the probability of entering from the unemployment stock at the end of January 2005 into each of these programmes in February 2005. We address the question whether people with particular problems of getting a job, like aged people or people <b>without</b> <b>formal</b> <b>qualifications,</b> are targeted by these policies. According to the new law all employable members of needy families should be activated. This includes partners of former unemployment insurance benefit recipients who did not participate in the labour market and are most likely hard-to-place. Our results do not suggest that the programmes generally target unemployed people who are particularly hard-to-place. This may be partly explained by the institutional set-up of the programmes. All programmes target young adults.

30|$|We {{therefore}} {{proposed that}} dropouts <b>without</b> <b>formal</b> vocational <b>qualifications</b> should have lower chances {{to enter a}} stable employment (Hypothesis 1 a) and achieve a lower occupational status in the first stable employment (Hypothesis 1 b) than graduates from vocational training, who have not entered higher education. We confirm Hypothesis 1 a, but surprisingly, the dropouts <b>without</b> <b>formal</b> vocational <b>qualifications</b> achieve status scores that are {{comparable to those of}} graduates from vocational training, so that we have to refute Hypothesis 1 b. Regarding the comparison of dropouts with and without vocational qualifications, we expected that the vocational credential serves as an ‘insurance’ as suggested by Büchel and Helberger (1995). We proposed that dropouts with a vocational qualification should be more likely to enter a stable employment (Hypothesis 2 a) and achieve on average a higher occupational status than dropouts without a vocational qualification (Hypothesis 2 b). Again, the overall probability of entering a stable job is higher for dropouts with pre-tertiary vocational training. This confirms Hypothesis 2 a, but against our expectation, dropouts without pre-tertiary vocational qualifications achieve on average a slightly higher occupational status. We acknowledge that this coefficient is small and not robust against alternative specifications, it hence remains debatable if this finding is in fact meaningful.|$|R
