40|$|Using {{quantum dot}} {{fluorescence}} imaging, we investigated the interference of surface plasmon beams in branched silver nanowire structures. Depending on the phases and polarizations {{of the incident}} light, interferences of plasmon beams modulate the plasmon propagation in the branched structures and the output light intensity in the distal ends. The interference visibility {{is strongly dependent on}} the incident polarization at the main <b>wire</b> <b>terminal,</b> and the mechanism is revealed by quantum dot fluorescence imaging of the near field distribution of propagating plasmons. The near field distribution pattern resulting from the beating of different plasmon modes plays a critical role in the plasmon interference. The overlap of the antinode in the near field pattern with the connection junction in the nanowire structure is required for a large interference visibility, since the overlap makes the electric field intensity difference of the two plasmon beams smaller. It is found that the plasmon interference is strongly dependent on the polarization of the excitation light at the main <b>wire</b> <b>terminal,</b> but weakly dependent on the polarization at the branch <b>wire</b> <b>terminal...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- In {{the near}} future it is {{expected}} that IPv 6 will lie at the backbone of all networks. Networks will consist of more mobile devices than <b>wired</b> <b>terminals.</b> Mobile users will demand to be always best connected and served (ABC&S). Such a dynamic system will require seamless mobility and flexible authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) scheme. Various emerging protocols may play a part in this fourth generation wireless world (4 GWW), e. g. Mobile IPv 6 (MIPv 6), hierarchical MIPv 6 (HMIPv 6), fast MIPv 6 (FMIPv 6) and the Diameter protocol. Used alone each of these protocols have their own strengths and weaknesses, however, a hybrid of all these protocols may emphasize their various strengths and eliminate their individual weaknesses. This paper proposes a new third-party AAA architectural framework, employing a hybrid signaling protocol and integrating mobility and AAA functions for 4 GWW orientated to a more consumer based business model (CBM) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{transmission}} of multimedia data over networks has increased steadily {{over the past}} few years and this increase is projected to accelerate in the future. However, virtually all current products and research for multimedia traffic over networks have concentrated solely on {{transmission of}} multimedia applications to and from <b>wired</b> <b>terminals.</b> Excluding mobile terminals from multimedia applications such as voice clearly limits the flexibility and potential of those applications. Additionally, the bandwidth allocated for wireless LANs in the IEEE 802. 11 standard is limited and overall throughput is limited, and these limitations will become a bottleneck for expanding wireless network capabilities. In this paper, we exploit another resource, i. e., space, and design a new Smart Wireless LAN (SWL) protocol to achieve throughput multiplication and flexibility for mixed traffic networks. Experimental studies and computer simulations will show the feasibility and performance benefits for using SWL with wireless LANs, particularly for multimedia applications. 1...|$|R

30|$|In this contribution, a no-reference metric for {{assessing}} the degradations introduced by transmission of an original video, encapsulated in a MPEG 2 TS, over a heterogeneous IP network is presented. Variable channel conditions may cause both isolated and clustered packet losses resulting in data and temporal integrity loss at the decoder side. This {{could lead to the}} impossibility of decoding isolated or clustered blocks, tiles, and even entire frames. Considering the continuous increase of computing power of both mobile and <b>wired</b> <b>terminals,</b> a wide spread of error concealment techniques aimed at increasing the perceived quality can be expected. The proposed system can be considered blind with respect to errors, such as delays and latencies that affected the link, and to the concealment strategies implemented at the decoders to face the potential quality loss. The proposed method is based on the evaluation of perceived quality of video delivered by a packet switched network. These networks are characterized by loss, delayed, or out-of-sequence delivery of packets. The proposed metric is therefore valid for mobile networks exploiting IP, i.e., UMTS, long-term evolution (LTE), and LTE Advanced.|$|R
