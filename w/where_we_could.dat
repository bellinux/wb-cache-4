500|$|The {{concept of}} Aquaman {{stemmed from a}} fifth season episode of Smallville, [...] "Aqua". The episode {{featured}} Arthur Curry (Alan Ritchson) coming to Smallville to stop an underwater weapons project being developed by LuthorCorp. [...] "Aqua" [...] became the highest rated episode for Smallville that season, {{but it was never}} meant to be a backdoor pilot for an Aquaman series. However, as work progressed on [...] "Aqua", the character was recognized to have potential for his own series. Miles Millar and Alfred Gough, the creators of Smallville, also considered a series featuring Lois Lane, but felt more confident about Aquaman. Millar said," [...] was the first idea where we really thought we had a franchise <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> see 100 episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{recorded}} {{material was}} slow and melodic, musically different from the aggressive rock music of Soundgarden. Cornell approached Wood's former bandmates, Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament—who were still {{figuring out how to}} continue without Mother Love Bone—with the intention of releasing the songs as a single. Ament described the collaboration as [...] "a really good thing at the time" [...] for Gossard and him that put them into a [...] "band situation <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> play and make music." [...] The band's lineup was completed by the addition of Soundgarden (and later Pearl Jam) drummer Matt Cameron and future Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McCready. They named themselves Temple of the Dog, a reference to a line in the lyrics of the Mother Love Bone song [...] "Man of Golden Words".|$|E
500|$|Director Kim Manners {{said of the}} episode: [...] "Not a great show, but a good one. It's {{a lighter}} show. There {{is a lot of}} humor in it, but I think it's a hit with fans because there is some {{wonderful}} Mulder and Scully's relationship stuff. The entire third act is {{just the two of them}} talking, which is actually kind of interesting. The scene where Mulder and Scully talk while stranded on a rock included approximately 10 pages of dialogue. Gillian Anderson said of the scene: [...] "I loved that. That was so much fun, and I think it was written really well... It was just neat to have us separated from everything and stuck on this island <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> wax philosophical and kind of tell the truth to each other in strange ways." [...] Character Dr. Paul Farraday was named after English scientist, Michael Faraday, maybe.|$|E

From the edge of the wharf <b>we</b> <b>could</b> see that Silver Spring was better worth looking at than {{anything}} we should be likely to see on shore.

60|$|The {{next day}} we walked around the walls two or three times, and found a place <b>where</b> <b>we</b> thought <b>we</b> <b>could</b> get up, {{if we had a}} rope {{fastened}} {{to the top of the}} wall. When General Oglethorpe bombarded the fort,--at the time the Spaniards held it,--he made a good many dents in the wall, and these would help us. I did climb up a few feet, but we saw that it would never do to try to get all the way up without a rope.|$|R
500|$|Development of Perfect Dark Zero {{began on}} the Nintendo GameCube with a very small team of roughly ten people. At the time, Nintendo had a 49% stake in Rare, making the company a Nintendo second-party developer. According to lead {{designer}} Chris Tilston, [...] "It was basically prototyping, finding out <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> go and how we could get there." [...] When Rare was purchased by Microsoft in 2002, the project {{was transferred to the}} Xbox console and the game's multiplayer mode was redesigned for online play. Tilston revealed that at one point they got to 50 players online simultaneously, but the graphics [...] "just couldn't handle it." [...] Since the initial version of the game pushed the original Xbox hardware [...] "pretty hard", the project was ultimately transferred to the Xbox successor, the Xbox 360. Tilston revealed that the original Xbox version was [...] "about 12 months away" [...] from completion when the shift occurred.|$|E
500|$|Curtis chose Notting Hill as {{he lived}} there {{and knew the}} area, saying [...] "Notting Hill is a melting pot and {{the perfect place to}} set a film". This left the {{producers}} to film in a heavily populated area. Kenworthy noted [...] "Early on, we {{toyed with the idea of}} building a huge exterior set. That way we would have more control, because we were worried about having Roberts and Grant on public streets <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> get thousands of onlookers." [...] In the end they decided to film in the streets. Michell was worried [...] "that Hugh and Julia were going to turn up on the first day of shooting on Portobello Road, and there would be gridlock and we would be surrounded by thousands of people and paparazzi photographers who would prevent us from shooting". The location team, and security personnel prevented this, as well as preventing problems the presence of a film crew may have caused the residents of Notting Hill, who Michell believes were [...] "genuinely excited" [...] about the film. The location manager Sue Quinn, described finding locations and getting permission to film as [...] "a mammoth task". Quinn and the rest of her team had to write to thousands of people in the area, promising to donate to each person's favourite charity, resulting in 200 charities receiving money.|$|E
500|$|Bennett had {{confirmed}} {{that he and}} Gaga would tour jazz festivals in 2015, supporting Cheek to Cheek. According to him, Gaga was tired from playing bigger venues, and wanted to have the tour visit smaller venues for at least three-four days, or for three-six weeks. Bennett also {{explained that he was}} accustomed to playing in acoustic music halls and outdoor theaters, so Gaga had been looking at such options. [...] "I'm not interested in playing to 45,000 people a night, so [...] finding places <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> work for three or four days, or three or four weeks, in one place at a time. That's how she wants to work with me.", the singer concluded. On New Year's Eve 2014, the duo started the Cheek to Cheek Tour by performing at the Cosmopolitan Casino of Las Vegas, making it their first concert in US following the album's release. They also performed at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards and its scheduled a post-Grammy concert on February 8, 2015, at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles, just after the conclusion of the ceremony. More shows were scheduled in 2015, including Hollywood Bowl on May 30; the Royal Albert Hall in London on June 8; and Radio City Music Hall in New York City on June 19. Jesse Lawrence from Forbes reported that there was high demand for the tickets, leading to additional dates being added to the itinerary. He also noted that the concerts had a much higher ticket price than the average, especially in the secondary markets.|$|E
60|$|So we {{sat there}} on that May morning, quite close together, for which there was, after all, no need, seeing that the steps were of a noble width. At our feet spread the garden away down the flight of {{terraces}} to end in the castle's grey, buttressed wall. But from <b>where</b> <b>we</b> sat <b>we</b> <b>could</b> look beyond this, our glance meeting the landscape {{a mile or so}} away with the waters of the Taro glittering in the sunshine, and the Apennines, all hazy, for an ultimate background.|$|R

It shaped our emotional attitudes, provided us with life purposes, and energized action. It consecrated suffering and integrated knowledge. We awoke in the morning and knew <b>where</b> <b>we</b> were. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> answer the questions of our children [...] [But now the old story] is no longer effective.

500|$|For Kilgrave, Maslansky used many suits {{created by}} {{designer}} Paul Smith, rather than custom-making {{them as she}} originally planned, as Smith [...] "was [...] about purple" [...] in the previous fashion season. On the suits, Maslansky added that the designers [...] "wanted {{to find a place}} <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> utilize clothing in shades of purple, but not go so over the top that it would look silly and that he would stop feeling ominous or menacing." [...] Expanding on this, Maslansky called purple a traditionally [...] "fairly friendly color, and he’s anything but friendly. So I had to find ways to make him be ominous and frightening and terrifying. I found that I needed the right proportion of shades of purple to other shades that were similar: navy, black, maroon." [...] Maslansky felt Luke Cage was also someone [...] "who wears his clothing like an armor," [...] with his wardrobe consisting of T-shirts, jeans, leather jackets or an army jacket. For a character like Trish Walker, who does not {{have the same kind of}} [...] "statement costume" [...] as Jones, Maslansky tried to create a certain character style. Maslansky said that Walker's uniform is fashion, so [...] "even when she was hanging around the house, she was wearing a pair of rag & bone jeans with a Chloé top, and this was her version of a T-shirt and jeans." [...] Maslansky added that Robin was [...] "a blast to dress" [...] because of her [...] "quirky" [...] personality, yet she was still able to [...] "put herself together aesthetically." [...] For Malcolm, as his story progressively became brighter throughout the season, so did his wardrobe, becoming [...] "a little brighter and a little more hopeful." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ament {{described}} the collaboration as [...] "a really good {{thing at the}} time" [...] for him and Gossard that put them into a [...] "band situation <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> play and make music". Gossard {{described the}} recording process as a [...] "non-pressure filled" [...] situation, as there were no expectations or pressure coming from the record company. Gossard later said it was [...] "the easiest and most beautiful record, that we've ever been involved with".|$|E
2500|$|In {{an article}} he {{published}} in 1847, Asachi defined {{himself as a}} partisan of [...] "the juste milieu" [...] on language matters, and recommended adopting words and rules of grammar with moderation, and from all sources available. According to the literary critic Garabet Ibrăileanu, [...] " [...] anybody who has ever read anything of what this writer has authored knows {{that he has a}} language of his own, a characteristic one, resembling those of many writers, without resemblig that of anyone else to the point <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> place him in any category." [...] The same commentator nonetheless noted that there were clear similarities between the way in which Asachi used Romanian and the language favored by Costache Conachi.|$|E
60|$|First {{experience}} on a bonefish shoal. This wide area of coral mud was dry at low tide. When we arrived {{the tide was}} rising. Water scarcely a foot deep, very clear. Bottom white, with patches of brown grass. We saw bonefish everywhere and expected great sport. But no matter <b>where</b> <b>we</b> stopped <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not get any bites. Schools of bonefish swam up to the boat, only to dart away. Everywhere we saw thin white tails sticking out, as they swam along, feeding with noses in the mud. When we drew in our baits we invariably found them half gone, and it was our assumption that the blue crabs did this.|$|R

The median age of the 733 satisfactory smears was 40 years. Age {{was a significant predictor}} for having an altered cytology (OR = 0. 96, 95 % CI = 0. 93 to 0. 98, p = 0. 001190). Candida albicans was the microorganism more frequently associated with non- neoplastic inflammatory changes...|$|R
2500|$|Using {{money from}} their Interscope contract, {{the band members}} {{designed}} and built their own recording studio, The Blasting Room, {{with the help of}} Egerton's father, Dan O'Reilly. [...] " [...] was the single smartest thing we probably ever did, really", said Egerton. [...] "Bill and I had thrown around {{the idea of having a}} studio forever, because by then any time we were home, we were recording Big Drill Car or Chemical People. We were always recording somebody, so we really wanted a place <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> refine our skills that way. We read some books and tried to learn what we could about how to lay the place out, and we actually built the place ourselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, Scottish {{researcher}} James Easton {{obtained the}} original witness {{statements made by}} {{those involved in the}} first night’s sightings. One of the witnesses, Ed Cabansag, said in his statement: [...] "We figured the lights were coming from past the forest since nothing was visible when we passed through the woody forest. We would see a glowing near the beacon light, but as we got closer we found it to be a lit-up farmhouse. We got to a vantage point <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> determine that what we were chasing was only a beacon light off in the distance." [...] Another participant, John Burroughs, also stated: [...] "We could see a beacon going around so we went towards it. We followed it for about two miles [...] before we could [...] it was coming from a lighthouse." ...|$|E
2500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the album began at Island Records' newly opened Basing Street Studios, London, {{at the same}} time as Jethro Tull's Aqualung in December 1970. Upon the recommendation of Fleetwood Mac, the band then moved to Headley Grange, a remote Victorian Estate house in East Hampshire, England, to conduct additional recordings. Here they used the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Jimmy Page later recalled: [...] "We needed the sort of facilities <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have a cup of tea and wander around the garden and go in and do what we had to do." [...] This relaxed, atmospheric environment at Headley Grange also provided other advantages for the band. As is explained by Dave Lewis, [...] "By moving into Headley Grange for the whole period of recording, many of the tracks [...] were made up on the spot and committed to tape almost there and then." ...|$|E

Light {{baffling}} winds continually, and we in a vessel {{as different from}} the [...] "Southern Cross" [...] as possible, absolutely guiltless, I should think, of having ever made two miles an hour to windward [...] "in a wind." [...] The one thing that stands out as having relieved its dreariness {{is the presence of}} Mr. Patteson, the visits he used to pay to us, and the exquisite pathos of his voice as, from the corner of the hold <b>where</b> <b>we</b> lay, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> hear him reading the Morning and Evening Prayers of the Church and leading the hymn. These prevented these long weary wakeful days and nights from being absolutely insupportable.' ...|$|R
2500|$|When {{asked in}} May 2012 {{about the future}} status of Army of Anyone, Luzier reiterated Patrick's {{comments}} {{that they were still}} in contact, and even stated there was music they were working on, responding, [...] "It’s possible.

2500|$|The IG report {{did find}} that some {{statements}} made by Gonzales at a March 13, 2007 press conference about his involvement were inaccurate. [...] The report however does not conclude that Gonzales deliberately provided false information. [...] He acknowledged from the outset his misstatements, accepted responsibility, and attempted {{to set the record}} straight well before congressional testimony on April 19, 2007. [...] Gonzales testified 18 months before the IG reports that statements he made at the March 13, 2007 press conference were misstatements and were overboard. [...] Further, in his written statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee, presented April 19, 2007, Gonzales wrote: [...] "I misspoke at a press conference on March 13th when I said that I [...] "was not involved in any discussions about what was going on." [...] That statement was too broad. [...] At that same press conference, I made clear that I was aware of the process; I said, [...] "I knew my Chief of Staff was involved in the process of determining who were the weak performers, where were the districts around the country <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do better for the people in that district, and that's what I knew". [...] Of course, I knew about the process because of, at a minimum, these discussions with Mr. Sampson. [...] Thus, my statement about [...] "discussions" [...] was imprecise and overboard, but it certainly was not in any way an attempt to mislead the American people." ...|$|E
2500|$|When the two steamers {{began their}} journey {{down the coast}} again, it wasn't long before they found three of the prahus. The water was shallow that the Rainbow had the Jolly Bachelor in tow and her captain, the rajah mudah, {{intended}} to release the other ship {{as soon as they}} were in a good firing position. Brooke then asked his Sarawakian followers if the three vessels in front of him were that of pirates, to be sure, and they said yes, so as soon as the Sulus realised they were under attack they began killing the captives while fleeing to dangerous waters. Father McDougall later wrote the following; [...] "So we took to our stations, loaded our guns, and prepared for action. The leading boat had already gained on the other two and was going nearly as fast as the steamer herself. I never saw fellows pull so. We put on all steam, cast off the Jolly, and tried to get in between her and the point, but she beat us, and passed inside of us into shallow water, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not follow. Then she opened her fire upon us, which we returned with interest. She, like the others, had no heavy guns, but they all carried three long brass swivels, called lelahs, and plenty of rifles and muskets." [...] The bishop went on to say that one of the captured pirates revealed to him that each of their swivels took seven men to lift and there was forty rifles and muskets aboard each boat, or more.|$|E
2500|$|Debney called Iron Man 2 [...] "odd in {{that there}} were {{not a lot of}} places where a true superhero theme could be played. Tony Stark is uber cool even as Iron Man, so, musically, we couldn’t state a {{full-blown}} superhero theme. The strains of Iron Man’s theme are heard only in a few spots by design. I’m hoping with future films, Iron Man might get his full-blown theme played aggressively." [...] For instance, Debney recorded several different versions of the score for scenes where Stark puts on the Iron Man suit, each with [...] "different portions of the theme fleshed out or left out". What was ultimately chosen [...] "was less thematic. It was sort of a groove {{with a little bit of}} French horn. Maybe that was the right choice, but it was a difficult decision. It was difficult to find the areas in the movie <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> let Tony be a superhero." [...] He continued, [...] "There were moments where I wanted to play a scene broadly or make a love scene out of it but we were never able to go there", such as for the end of the film where [...] "Tony finally kisses Pepper ... there were a couple of versions I did that were really gorgeous and lush but it just didn't fit. It's a different kind of movie because they kiss and then all of a sudden the mood is broken. It's just the nature of this character." [...] Debney felt that this process led to the score being [...] "watered down and mashed up a little bit" [...] from what he originally intended. However, Debney did not feel the same about his music for the villain, Ivan Vanko, which he described as a personal [...] "joy". He said that Favreau [...] "gave me a great opportunity to get into [...] scene and learn 's circumstances and to play sincerely sad music for him and the relationship he had with his father. Jon gave me the opportunity to morph that and turn it into something really dark and twisted. For me that was the most satisfactory part of the score and the film". For Vanko's theme, the choir sang in Russian to [...] "capture the dark Russian soul" [...] of the character.|$|E
