5|$|Fausto's {{remnants}} passed {{north of}} the Hawaiian Islands uneventfully until they interacted with a tropical upper-tropospheric trough (TUTT) on August 30. In combination <b>with</b> <b>warm</b> waters, a tropical depression with some subtropical features developed. At {{this time it was}} located around latitude 30°N. By September 1, Fausto had redeveloped into a tiny but tropical ministorm. Its rebirth was brief, however, as a mid-latitude cyclone absorbed the system early on September 3.|$|E
5|$|Salta, {{like the}} rest of the Solway plain, has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate {{classification}} Cfb), <b>with</b> <b>warm</b> summers and cool winters which generally avoid extremes of temperature. Salta has a cool climate, with average daytime highs of around 19°C during July and 7°C during December, although lows of −12°C have been recorded. It is wet all year round, with rain or drizzle expected on 16 to 19 days of most months. Snowfall is relatively uncommon.|$|E
5|$|A mid-level ridge over Mexico {{caused the}} cyclone to track {{steadily}} northwestward. <b>With</b> <b>warm</b> water temperatures and low vertical wind shear, the depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Ileana. Convection developed and organized into a central dense overcast, and with abundant low-level moisture, rapid deepening was expected. An eye {{formed in the}} center of the convection, and Ileana attained hurricane status late on August22. On August23, about 48hours after forming, Ileana reached major hurricane status and a peak intensity of 120mph (195km/h) about 60mi (100km) southeast of Socorro Island. It also attained an atmospheric pressure of 955mbar, as well as an eye diameter of 23mi (37km).|$|E

5|$|An active trough of low {{pressure}} exited the East Coast of the United States on May 12, {{and by the}} following day it passed near Bermuda. Initially the trough was located only near the surface, though as cold air from behind it advanced eastward, the trough extended into the mid- to upper-levels of the atmosphere. By May 14 a closed {{low pressure}} area developed in seclusion from the westerlies. Continued cold air from behind the trough, about 12°F (7°C) colder than usual for the time of year, extended across the low in conjunction <b>with</b> <b>warm</b> upper levels and warm sea surface temperatures, resulting in large amounts of instability. The polar trough gradually weakened as the low organized, and on May 15 it developed into a subtropical depression while located about 300miles (480km) south of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|During October 7, <b>with</b> <b>warm</b> water {{helping to}} fuel its intensification, Madeline quickly {{intensified}} into a Category 2 hurricane, and was upgraded {{to a major}} hurricane (Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale) early on October 8. Based on hurricane hunter reports, Madeline reached its peak sustained winds of 145 mph (230 km/h) and a peak pressure of 940 millibars early on the 8th. This made Madeline a moderate Category 4 hurricane. Later that morning Madeline made landfall to the northwest of Zihuatanejo as a powerful Category 4 hurricane, before it rapidly dissipated over land.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} and summer, {{conditions}} along {{the east coast of}} Australia are highly conducive for the formation of hailstorms. The variation of air temperature in the atmosphere; <b>with</b> <b>warm</b> and humid air close to the ground and colder air above it causes instability, and the cold upper atmosphere temperatures allow the precipitation to fall in solid form as hailstones.

5|$|Late on June 3, the IMD {{upgraded}} {{the storm}} to Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Gonu. <b>With</b> <b>warm</b> waters, low amounts of vertical wind shear, and favorable upper-level outflow, Gonu strengthened further to attain peak 1-min sustained winds of 270km/h (165mph) and gusts to 315km/h (195mph), about 285km (175mi) east-southeast of Masirah Island {{on the coast}} of Oman. The IMD upgraded it to Super Cyclonic Storm Gonu late on June 4, with peak 3-min sustained winds reaching 240km/h (150mph) and an estimated pressure of 920mbar. This made it the first super cyclonic storm in the Arabian Sea on record.|$|E
5|$|Scarborough's {{climate is}} {{moderate}} for Canada {{due to its}} southerly location within the country and its proximity to Lake Ontario.

5|$|The Shishugou Formation {{represents}} {{a variety of}} depositional environments, including alluvial fans and alluvial plains, streams, wetlands, and shallow lakes. During the time when Limusaurus lived, the environment would have been consistently warm and dry, judging by the abundance of coal and carbon-rich deposits. The climate was probably highly seasonal due to monsoonal influences, <b>with</b> <b>warm,</b> wet summers and dry winters. The climate enabled {{the growth of a}} richly forested environment; the forest would have been dominated by Araucaria trees, with the undergrowth being occupied by Coniopteris tree ferns, Anglopteris and Osmunda ferns, Equisetites horsetails, and Elatocladus shrubs.|$|E
5|$|The {{coastal areas}} {{bordering}} the Sea of Marmara, which connects the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea, have a transitional climate between a temperate Mediterranean climate and a temperate oceanic climate <b>with</b> <b>warm</b> to hot, moderately dry summers and cool to cold, wet winters. Snow {{falls on the}} coastal areas of the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea almost every winter, but usually melts in {{no more than a}} few days.

5|$|The {{depression}} {{moved slowly}} to the north-northwest through {{a break in the}} subtropical ridge, and as convective banding features became more prominent the system intensified into Tropical Storm Beryl. Throughout much of its duration, the storm tracked through an environment with light vertical wind shear and well-established upper-level outflow. Shortly after becoming a tropical storm, the low-level circulation of Beryl became exposed with limited deep convection, though deep convection re-developed the following morning. Outflow continued to improve, and <b>with</b> <b>warm</b> sea surface temperatures Beryl gradually intensified to attain peak winds of 60mph (95km/h) early on July 20 while located about 120miles (190km) east of Nags Head, North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Imbudo {{were from a}} disorganized area of {{convection}} near Chuuk in the open western Pacific in mid-July. With weak wind shear, the system slowly became better organized. On July15, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated that a tropical depression formed. The next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert (TCFA), noting that outflow had increased due to an upper-level low to the northeast. At 1800UTC on July16, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 09W about 665km (415mi) east of Yap. A subtropical ridge near Okinawa steered the nascent depression to the west-northwest for much of its duration. <b>With</b> <b>warm</b> waters and favorable upper-level conditions, the depression quickly organized, and the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm Imbudo on July17.|$|E
5|$|Upon first {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression was located within {{an area of}} weak steering currents. Initially it was forecast to remain offshore; <b>with</b> <b>warm</b> waters and light wind shear, the depression was forecast to intensify into a strong tropical storm, and possibly attain hurricane status. However, the circulation was difficult to locate, and as such its exact motion was uncertain. Ships in the region confirmed {{the center of the}} storm as further northeast than previously thought, but also confirmed tropical storm force winds; as a result, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Norman. Strengthening continued, and Norman attained peak winds of 50mph (85km/h), shortly prior to making landfall west of Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán, late on September20.|$|E

40|$|The {{scaling of}} {{updraught}} velocities {{over a wide}} range of surface temperatures is investigated in simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium with a cloud-system resolving model. The updraught velocities increase <b>with</b> <b>warming,</b> <b>with</b> the largest fractional increases occurring in the upper troposphere and for the highest percentile updraughts. A plume model approximately reproduces the increases in updraught velocities if the plume environment is prescribed as the mean profile in each simulation while holding the entrainment and microphysical assumptions fixed. Convective available potential energy (CAPE) also increases <b>with</b> <b>warming</b> in the simulations but at a much faster fractional rate when compared with the square of the updraught velocities. This discrepancy is investigated with a two-plume model in which a weakly entraining plume represents the most intense updraughts, and the environment is assumed to adjust so that a more strongly entraining plume has negligible buoyancy. The two-plume model suggests that updraught velocities increase <b>with</b> <b>warming</b> at a lower fractional rate than implied by the CAPE because of the influence of entrainment on both the mean stratification and the updraughts themselves.
