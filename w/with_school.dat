5|$|Although {{reluctant}} {{to comment on}} the issue, Hareide was likely single during his first tenure in national politics. He has been confronted with rumours of homosexuality by segments of the media, but these have been dismissed. In 2008 he was reported as having a relationship with Solveig Engevik from Kolbotn, which ended in 2010. In the spring of 2011 he was confirmed in a relationship <b>with</b> <b>school</b> teacher Lisa Marie Larsen.|$|E
5|$|His {{chances of}} {{obtaining a licence}} were put into further {{jeopardy}} because he had collected eight recorded misdemeanours with the police during his youth. In 1960, he received his first car, an old Volkswagen Beetle. His interest in motorsport greatly increased when he visited the 1961 German Grand Prix at the Nürburgring <b>with</b> <b>school</b> friends, including fellow future Formula One driver Helmut Marko.|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing a}} Bad Brains concert, MacKaye and Nelson began {{playing in a}} punk band, the Slinkees, <b>with</b> <b>school</b> friends Grindle and Mark Sullivan. The Slinkees played a single show before Sullivan went to college. After a failed attempt to recruit MacKaye's friend Henry Garfield (later Henry Rollins), the band added Strejcek as the vocalist. The Slinkees soon renamed {{themselves}} the Teen Idles. After touring and practicing for several months, the band recorded two demo sessions at a local studio in February and April 1980, despite the engineer and a visiting band openly laughing as they recorded. They also began playing at house parties and pizza parlors, and opened for Bad Brains at an art gallery, in a dilapidated row house in the Adams-Morgan neighborhood, called Madam's Organ.|$|E

5|$|Born in Los Angeles, Parsons {{was raised}} by a wealthy family on Orange Grove Avenue in Pasadena. Inspired by science fiction literature, he {{developed}} an interest in rocketry in his childhood and in 1928 began amateur rocket experiments <b>with</b> <b>school</b> friend Ed Forman. He dropped out of Pasadena Junior College and Stanford University due to financial difficulties during the Great Depression, and in 1934 he united with Forman and graduate student Frank Malina to form the Caltech-affiliated Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory (GALCIT) Rocket Research Group, supported by Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory chairman Theodore von Kármán. In 1939 the GALCIT Group gained funding from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to work on Jet-Assisted Take Off (JATO) for the U.S. military. Following American entry into World War II, in 1942 they founded Aerojet to develop and sell their JATO technology; the GALCIT Group became JPL in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Later in June, Fox News did {{a report}} on the {{families}} of the candidates running for President. Jim Gilmore's family was described as being busy <b>with</b> <b>school</b> and employment, limiting them from full-time campaigning. Two of the candidate's sons, Ashton and Jay were examined for the report. Ashton Gilmore worked full-time for his father's campaign headquarters, and Jay Gilmore worked in Washington and was only able to campaign as his schedule allowed. In election polling, unpromising results surfaced for the Gilmore campaign. In a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll, Gilmore failed to register half a percentage point among Republican voters. A grimmer portrait was painted for the campaign when end of the month finances revealed it was nearly broke with only $61,765 cash on hand from the $391,693 that had been raised overall.|$|E

After reviewing and examining more than 160 publications, four key issues emerged: that the concept of family and community connections <b>with</b> <b>schools</b> needs to be clarified, that outcomes of family and community connections <b>with</b> <b>schools</b> need to be measured in a consistent way, that the research base for family and community connections <b>with</b> <b>schools</b> needs to be advanced, and that critical areas for research in this field still exist.

5|$|The main {{airport for}} Roskilde is Copenhagen Airport {{which can be}} reached in about 40 minutes by train. Since April 1973, {{there has also been}} the small local Roskilde Airport, serving light {{aircraft}} for training, taxi, and flight instruction. There are plans to expand it for use by larger aircraft, possibly including discount international flights. The plans were approved, but lack of commitment from any carriers has postponed progress. The airport currently handles up to 100,000 operations (flights) per year, most of which are light aircraft operations associated <b>with</b> <b>school</b> flights.|$|E
5|$|The mission {{grew from}} {{strength}} to strength and by 1907 the congregation numbered 150, <b>with</b> <b>school</b> attendance at 60. In time plans {{were made for}} a larger, more permanent church. This {{was the brainchild of}} Father Thomas Moloney, who bought the current presbytery and acquired the land that stood at the back so that a church could be built. The foundation stone was eventually laid on Low Sunday 1931 by Archbishop Alban Goodier, an English Jesuit who had been Archbishop of Bombay between 1919 and 1926. The new church, in Oxford Road, was designed by the diocesan architect, T. H. B. Scott. It was built of brick in the Romanesque style, seating 350. The church was built quickly and opened by Cardinal Bourne on 29 September 1931. It was officially consecrated on 14 May 1936, after its debts were cleared.|$|E
5|$|The series begins while set in 1978, as Frank {{gets into}} trouble with the law. Mr. Jarvis (John Stone), {{a man from the}} {{department}} of child services, explains that Frank's father Les (Mario Kery), is a criminal and his mother, Helena (Lee Sanderson) is an alcoholic. As he grows up he aspires to emulate Les' criminal dealings. Pippa and Tom take Frank in as their first foster child. Upon moving to Summer Bay, Frank tries to get a job in Alf Stewart's (Ray Meagher) shop where he meets Roo. Frank is attracted to Roo and tells Alf that he had been helping Roo with her school work. Alf gives him the job alongside helping Roo with her studies. Frank is not good <b>with</b> <b>school</b> work so he pays his foster brother, Steven to do it for him. They begin dating, but Alf becomes angry with Frank for convincing Roo to skip school. The pair nearly sleep together, but Roo asks him to wait.|$|E

VT129 then heads to the south, paralleling the shores of the La Motte Passage (a part of Lake Champlain).

5|$|A month later, Jennifer is {{beginning}} to look pale, so she accepts a date <b>with</b> <b>school</b> goth/emo Colin, whom she brutally kills. While Needy and Chip have sex, Needy senses something dreadful has happened. She leaves in a panic and almost runs over Jennifer, who is drenched in blood. At home, she finds Jennifer in her bedroom. Jennifer kisses her, initiating a brief makeout session, and soon explains what happened after the fire: Low Shoulder took her {{into the woods and}} offered her as a virgin sacrifice to Satan in exchange for fame and fortune. Although the sacrifice and demonic exchange were a success, Jennifer was not a virgin. As a result, when lead singer Nikolai murdered her, the ritual backfired and a demonic spirit took over her body. Unbeknownst to Needy, Jennifer also encountered Indian exchange student Ahmet after the fire and, upon hearing that no one knew he had survived, took him into the woods and made him her first victim. Jennifer states that when she has eaten, she can withstand virtually any injury without pain, making her rather difficult to kill.|$|E
