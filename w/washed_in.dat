5|$|At {{the same}} time, and just {{opposite}} his own tomb, Ramesses enlarged the earlier small tomb {{of an unknown}} Eighteenth Dynasty noble (KV5) for his numerous sons. With 120 known rooms, and excavation work still underway, it is probably the largest tomb in the valley. Originally opened (and robbed) in antiquity, it is a low-lying structure that has been particularly prone to the flash floods that sometimes hit the area. Tonnes of debris and material has <b>washed</b> <b>in</b> over the centuries, ultimately concealing its vast size. It is not currently open to the public.|$|E
5|$|The Russian {{imperial}} {{family was}} a frequent target for assassins, so for safety reasons the Grand Duchess was raised at the country palace of Gatchina, about 50miles (80km) west of Saint Petersburg. Olga and her siblings, however, were not accustomed to a lavish early lifestyle. Conditions in the nursery were modest, even Spartan. They slept on hard camp beds, rose at dawn, <b>washed</b> <b>in</b> cold water, and ate a simple porridge for breakfast.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{second floor}} houses the library. It {{contains}} the scriptures of Gyetengpa, Doduipa, Mamtha, Kangyur, Tengyur and Zungdui, {{which have been}} affected due to insect attacks. The collection in the library consists of two printed books of Tengyur (in 25 volumes), which are commentaries on Buddhist teachings; three sets of Kangyur, the translated version of the canons of Buddhist teachings; and Chanjia Sangbhums in five volumes. Of the three sets of Kangyur, two are handwritten and one is printed. The printed sets are in 101 volumes. One handwritten set has 131 volumes and the other 125 volumes; the letters of these 125 books are <b>washed</b> <b>in</b> gold. The religious text, Gyentongpa, has letters <b>washed</b> <b>in</b> gold in all its pages. At some stage, some of the sacred scriptures were lost and the reason was attributed to the monks of the Tsona monastery who used to visit Tawang during winter time. In the past, these monks had demanded that the gilded image of the Buddha be gifted to them. This was not accepted by the Lamas of the Tawang Monastery and as result the Tsona Lamas refused to part {{with some of the}} sacred texts and records of the Tawang Monastery which were with them. They again took away more books in 1951.|$|E

5|$|Cannon {{recovered}} from the sea are often extensively damaged from exposure to salt water; because of this, electrolytic reduction treatment is required to forestall the process of corrosion. The cannon is then <b>washed</b> <b>in</b> deionized water to remove the electrolyte, and is treated in tannic acid, which prevents further rust and gives the metal a bluish-black colour. After this process, cannons on display may be protected from oxygen and moisture by a wax sealant. A coat of polyurethane may also be painted over the wax sealant, to prevent the wax-coated cannon from attracting dust in outdoor displays.|$|E

60|$|On {{the morning}} after the wedding, when the two girls awoke, milk was {{standing}} for the man's daughter to <b>wash</b> <b>in</b> and wine for her to drink; but for the woman's daughter, only water to <b>wash</b> <b>in</b> and only water to drink. On the second morning, water to <b>wash</b> <b>in</b> and water to drink was standing for the man's daughter as well. And on the third morning, water to <b>wash</b> <b>in</b> and water to drink was standing for the man's daughter, and milk to <b>wash</b> <b>in</b> and wine to drink for the woman's daughter; and so it continued ever after. The woman hated her stepdaughter from the bottom of her heart, and did all she could to make her life miserable. She was as jealous as she could possibly be, because the girl was so beautiful and charming, while her own daughter was both ugly and repulsive.|$|R

The Call to Action campaign incorporates six key action points, one of which calls for improved monitoring of <b>WASH</b> <b>in</b> Schools programs. National monitoring systems for <b>WASH</b> <b>in</b> schools are often weak; many countries do not have even basic data on the <b>WASH</b> situation <b>in</b> schools. This lack {{of information on the}} status of <b>WASH</b> <b>in</b> schools hampers planning and resource allocation decisions, and makes it difficult to ensure accountability and evaluate progress. This package is designed to help address the <b>WASH</b> <b>in</b> Schools monitoring deficit at the national level. It is designed as a resource for WASH and Education professionals and practitioners to strengthen national monitoring systems and {{to improve the quality of}} monitoring at the project level...|$|R

The dirty parts of a parka were immersed in a wooden urine dish and the fur kneaded down into the urine with a movement like kneading bread dough. Then the garment was shaken out and hung up to dry. Sometimes it was rinsed in clear water.|$|E

A special building for the corpse-washing existed in the cemetery in 15th century Prague, a practice which obtains in many Jewish communities today; a mikveh is provided at a number of ancient tombs. Female corpses are traditionally cleaned only by other females, and males only by other males.|$|E

25|$|Vegetable (paper) {{parchment}} is made {{by passing}} a waterleaf (an unsized paper like blotters) made of pulp fibers into sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid hydrolyses and solubilises the main natural organic polymer, cellulose, present in the pulp wood fibers. The paper web is then <b>washed</b> <b>in</b> water, which stops the hydrolysis of the cellulose and causes a kind of cellulose coating to form on the waterleaf. The final paper is dried. This coating is a natural non-porous cement, that gives to the vegetable parchment paper its resistance to grease and its semi-translucency.|$|E
25|$|In Catholicism, holy water, as well {{as water}} used during the washing of the priest's hands at mass, {{is not allowed to}} be {{disposed}} of in regular plumbing. Roman Catholic churches will usually have a special basin (a Sacrarium) that leads directly into the ground for the purpose of proper disposal. A hinged lid is kept over the holy water basin to distinguish it from a regular sink basin, which is often just beside it. Items that contained holy water are separated, drained of the holy water, and then <b>washed</b> <b>in</b> a regular manner in the adjacent sink.|$|E

Bedding and clothing used in the last three days should be <b>washed</b> <b>in</b> hot water and dried in a hot dryer. As the mite does not live for more than three days away from human skin, more washing is not needed. Symptoms may continue for two to four weeks following treatment. If after this time symptoms continue, retreatment may be needed.|$|E

Employers can reduce the risk for employees by providing education on Lyme transmission and infection risks, and about how to check themselves for ticks on the groin, armpits, and hair.

25|$|After eleven years, Cuthbert's {{successor}} Bishop Eadberht {{orders the}} reopening of Cuthbert's coffin; Cuthbert's body {{is found to}} be incorrupt, i.e. having not decayed any noticeable way (chapter fourteen). Miracles begin happening at Cuthbert's coffin, prayers and holy water from the trench Cuthbert's body had been <b>washed</b> <b>in</b> curing a boy from demonic possession (fifteen). A monk from the household of Bishop Willbrord, visiting Lindisfarne, was taken by serious illness but was cured after praying at Cuthbert's coffin (chapter sixteen). Likewise, a paralytic youth brought to Lindisfarne by another monastery for attention from Lindisfarne medics, is cured only after wearing the shoes once worn by Cuthbert (chapter seventeen). The author ends the Anonymous Life of Cuthbert declaring that he has omitted many other miracles in order to avoid overburdening his reader (chapter eighteen).|$|E
25|$|Jellyfish {{deteriorate}} rapidly at {{room temperature}} so processing starts soon after they are caught. The bell is separated from the dangling oral arms and both are <b>washed</b> <b>in</b> seawater before being scraped to remove the gonads and mucus. Dehydration is traditionally undertaken by sprinkling the jellyfish with table salt and alum, draining off the brine and repeating the process. Finally the jellyfish are heaped to drain, turned several times and left to dry. The whole process takes three to six weeks and results in a product with about 65% moisture and 20% salt. The alum reduces the pH and serves to firm the texture while the salt removes water and prevents microbial deterioration. In Malaysia and Thailand, a little sodium bicarbonate is added during processing which facilitates dehydration and increases crispness.|$|E
