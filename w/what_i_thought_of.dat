25|$|Wilson’s diary {{records that}} on 24 March he (5pm) telephoned Lloyd George {{to ask him}} to come to London, {{received}} a telephone call from Foch (“asking <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> situation & we are of one mind that someone must catch a hold or we shall be beaten. I said I would come over and see him”), then had a meeting with Lloyd George at Downing Street where they discussed “the entirely inadequate measures taken by Haig and Petain” before receiving an evening message from Haig asking him to come over. There is no evidence to confirm Haig's later claim that, on returning from a midnight meeting with Petain at 3am on 25 March, he telegraphed to Wilson and Milner to come over to France and ensure the appointment of “Foch or some other determined general who would fight” as Allied Generalissimo. Wilson reached GHQ at Montreuil at 11.30am on 25 March, having left London by special train at 6.50am then crossed to France on a destroyer. He chided Haig for having, together with Petain, blocked the plan for an Allied reserve, although in fact Petain sent a dozen divisions and it is unclear that a committee would actually have acted any faster. Travers argued that the true reason for Wilson’s visit to France was to discuss a retreat on the Channel Ports, but this view is not accepted by other scholars.|$|E
500|$|Kubizek {{describes}} {{the first time}} he heard about Hitler's obsession as follows: [...] "One evening in the spring of 1905, as we were taking our usual stroll, Adolf gripped my arm and asked me excitedly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> that slim blonde girl walking along the Landstrasse arm-in-arm with her mother. 'You must know, I'm in love with her,' he added resolutely." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{started writing}} what I felt was Bat Out of Hell part 2, {{definitely}} like The Godfather part I and part 2, that's how I saw it. I {{wanted to do}} a continuation and I {{wanted to do a}}n album that went even further and that was more extreme, if possible, which a lot of people felt wasn't possible but I just wanted to see if I could make a record that was even more heroic because that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it ... Bat Out of Hell to me was ultimately very heroic though it was funny ... and I wanted to do one that to me would be even more heroic and more epic and a little more operatic and passionate.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the Lake <b>of</b> Como <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Lugano: it {{must have}} been {{wonderful}} when the Romans came there. Now it is all villas. I think only the sunrise is still wonderful, sometimes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] she began, [...] "I {{will tell}} you <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>of.</b> It would be easy enough, {{if it was not}} for him. He's so big, and so red, and he doesn't speak German.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} help being amused, though I heard the old lady out with {{feelings}} of real concern. It was difficult to doubt her with {{the father and son}} before me. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> might have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> them without the old lady's account, or <b>what</b> <b>I</b> might have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the old lady's account without them, I cannot say. There was a fitness of things in the whole that carried conviction with it.|$|R
2500|$|In August 2010 Raffaele Cardinal Farina, {{archivist}} and librarian of the Holy Roman Church, {{said that}} Pope John Paul II declined then-Cardinal Ratzinger's request {{to spend his}} last years at the Vatican Archives. Cardinal Farina recalled when he was appointed prefect of the Vatican Library in May 1997 having a brief meeting with Cardinal Ratzinger {{in which he was}} asked his opinion of Ratzinger joining the team. Ratzinger asked the Pope if he could step down from his role when he turned 70 on 16 April 1997. [...] "He was asking me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> his idea and what being archivist and librarian of the Holy Roman Church involved", said Farina.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the third}} day, the {{controversy}} restarted. At {{the end of}} the 116th over of India's first innings, Harbhajan was batting with Tendulkar in a vital partnership for India, who had just lost a series of quick wickets. Lee was the bowler in that over and Harbhajan had just edged him over the slips for four. Harbhajan then tapped Lee on the backside with his bat, apparently saying [...] "hard luck", to which Lee did not react. Symonds says he needed to stand up for Lee so in his own words, he [...] "had a bit of a crack at Harbhajan, telling him exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> his antics". Symonds went on to claim that Harbhajan then [...] "shot back" [...] by calling him a monkey. Symonds stated in the appeal hearing that he believed that Test cricket was no place to be friendly to opposition players, so he spoke to Harbhajan. Under questioning he admitted that he had provoked the incident and used the word [...] "fuck" [...] among other language against Harbhajan, who stated that he then became [...] "very angry" [...] because of the use of this word.|$|E
2500|$|Jimmy [...] was an {{education}} for me, {{as he was}} for most people who {{came in contact with}} him. ... taught me about art and developed my taste, but I didn't begin to understand about making work until later with Yvonne Rainer. [...] From her I found out {{what it is to be}} an artist [...] a person who makes choices and stands behind them. [...] Then, from working with Trisha Brown in the Grand Union, I learned how to edit, how to boil a thing down to its essence. Jimmy's approach was much more whimsical. His way of working led you [...] or led me at any rate [...] to accept any idea as valid simply because I'd thought of it. [...] I thought of it and I kept it, and what came next was <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> next. [...] I don't believe Jimmy meant to absolve me of all responsibility for my work, but I got the impression that wild intuitive guessing was all I had to do to make art. [...] I never threw anything away. [...] I remember distinctly Jimmy's saying, [...] "If you don't like it now, you can get to like it. [...] If you can't get to like it, who says you have to like it?" [...] The point of it was to demystify art and free the artist from the limitations of his own taste. [...] There was a great sense of liberation that stemmed from John Cage's championing of this philosophy, and Jimmy, among others, was establishing alternatives to the kind of teaching that had dominated modern-dance composition up until then.|$|E
6000|$|... "Master," [...] remarked Dick, [...] "I did {{not think}} you had so much wit--that is, since you fell in love, for before then you were sharp enough. Well, you are right, and a little matter like that may turn a battle. Not but <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> it already." ...|$|R
6000|$|That little tribute {{restored}} him to {{his place}} in his wife's estimation. [...] "I may tell you now," [...] she resumed, with her gentle smile, [...] "that you only remind me <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> already. My milliner is at work for Miss Westerfield. The new dress must be your gift." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Mr. Homos knows <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{must have}} <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> his talk without my telling him," [...] I began, skilfully. [...] "But I am sorry that I am {{to lose my}} {{distinguished}} guest so soon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye, that I did! She wouldn't tell you. There'll be many a {{thing in}} life she won't tell you. I went to let her hear from my lips <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> her as a wife for you. I told her <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> a woman who plays {{the part of a}} wanton--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I couldn't {{tell her}} that night <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> her, for she had seemed more {{minutely}} commonplace than ever. She had trotted round her little well-worn circle of graces and accomplishments, even to playing her favorite selection on the piano. I equivocated. I professed it was not very easy to say <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> her, and added: ...|$|E
60|$|Attley, the well-meaning man, {{to make me}} feel at ease, asked <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the name.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{should have}} <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> sooner,' she said; 'and I did think o't, but I durst na open the door, for there's a' the bairns, poor things, sae keen {{to see their}} father.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} a man, Scudamour? Reply," [...] was <b>what</b> Alexander said. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{answering}} that we had met a man of that name {{when we were in}} Paris; but after consideration, I replied boldly: [...] "Know no one of name of Scudamour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it was terrible! And she didn't say {{a single}} word in praise of what the soldier had done for her. Now {{that seems to me}} downright ungrateful, and not at all <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Miss Armstrong." ...|$|R
60|$|Don Felipe {{turned to}} me and asked <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the Seville prison. I made some {{complimentary}} reply.|$|E
60|$|However, I {{am happy}} to say he {{remained}} where he was, and asked me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Mrs. Jellyby.|$|E
6000|$|... "Some months ago,--before these sad {{things had}} occurred,--I told you <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> you, and I asked {{you for a}} favour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{went over}} there," [...] he said, [...] "because I would not willingly omit {{anything}} that Mr. Prendergast had suggested; but I {{did not expect}} any good to come of it. You know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have always <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Owen Fitzgerald." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>what</b> <b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> before," [...] said John. [...] "You {{know we are}} {{so often}} asked whether we belong to Joseph Brownlow, that one forgets to mention it every time; but that day, when Dr. Medlicott {{took me to the}} Westminster hospital, we fell in with Dr. Ruthven, and after the usual {{disappointment}} on finding I was only the nephew and not the son, he said, 'Joseph Brownlow would have been a great man if he had lived. I owe a great deal to a hint he once gave me?'" ...|$|R
60|$|It was, of course, a {{very good}} match for her; and <b>what</b> was, <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>of</b> far more importance, I could see {{by the way she}} wrote that she really was very fond of him for his own sake. In one of her after letters to me, she laughed and said that it was terribly galling to her pride to have to take up with my {{rejected}} one; but that, as this was the only possible objection she could find to marrying him, she could not allow it to counterbalance all the advantages of her so doing.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And so you {{actually}} despatched my Lord to eat humble pie in my name. You might have {{waited to see}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> the process.' ...|$|E
60|$|Because {{he was so}} dear, so good, so admirable. I {{tried to}} tell him <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> him, but I could not {{articulate}} a word.|$|E
6000|$|... "Humph!" [...] {{said the}} old lady. [...] "She cheated {{me out of the}} {{pleasure}} of telling him <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> him, and I shall never forgive her for that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{should have}} <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> him," [...] {{answered}} Rachel, [...] "and {{we know that}} he is not brave," [...] she added with a smile. [...] "But never mind this jackal in a lion's hide; tell me your story, Noie, if you will, only speak low, for this tent is thin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Field {{has written}} to me, sending a cutting of an {{advertisement}} {{of a month}} back of a spiritualist from Abville, which he thinks may be my husband's. I am sure it is, I know the Greek idiom put into English. It decides me on <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> before. <b>I</b> shall offer my services as nurse or physician, or whatever they will let me be in that stress of need. I may find him, or if he have fled, I may, if I live, trace him. At any rate, by God's grace, I may thus endeavour {{to make a better}} use of what has never yet been used for His service.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is <b>what</b> <b>I,</b> too, have <b>thought</b> <b>of,</b> Clotilde. The {{disguise}} {{would be}} a poor one, for the roundness of your arms and the colour of your eyes would betray you at once to any one who looked closely at you. However, as I can see no better way, I will get the garments and some for myself to match, and some stuff for staining the skin and hair." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'In earnest. And I {{confess to}} the secret chamber. Don't you {{remember}} that you asked me not to declare <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> your higher qualities until you had been tried?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Blodgett {{was driving}} {{in some of}} Tyner's calves, and I caught him. I told him <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> him, and he shot at me through his pocket. That was all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Had another wrangle with Jason Sparr," [...] {{explained}} Phil, {{after the}} meal. [...] "He followed me {{to one of}} the stores, and I told him just <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> him." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{song was}} {{recorded}} {{on a night}} when Wyman had shown up to the studio {{and found that the}} session had been cancelled. Feeling frustrated that he had potentially wasted time in driving to the studio, engineer Glyn Johns asked him if he had anything that he'd like to record. [...] "...I'd been messing with this song. It was a bit... <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> was kind <b>of</b> spacy, you know... a bit kind of Satanic Majesties-like. And psychedelic in a way." ...|$|R
60|$|I, of course, was the {{principal}} object of general attention. They wanted to know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> really <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Billy Marshall as a scholar. They {{wanted to know if}} I would have some more. They wanted to know if I had had any previous experience with bears. The father asked which <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{it would be easier to}} manage, a boy or a bear. The boy Percy wanted to know how I placed my feet when I stood up in front of a runaway horse. Others asked if I intended to go back to my school at Walford, and how I liked the village, and if I were president of the literary society there, which Mrs. Larramie <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> ought to be, on account of my scholastic position.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Adam. [...] "I don't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should ha' <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> her and {{her letter}} if I'd never seen her: I daresay <b>I</b> should ha' <b>thought</b> a preaching woman hateful. But she's one as makes {{everything}} seem right she says and does, and I seemed to see her and hear her speaking when I read the letter. It's wonderful how I remember her looks and her voice. She'd make thee rare and happy, Seth; she's just the woman for thee." ...|$|R
