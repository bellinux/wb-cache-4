5|$|The School for Creative and Performing Arts {{opened in}} August 1973, {{as the only}} grade four through six school for the {{performing}} arts in the country and the first public school that combined all of the arts in a single program. The curriculum included art, instrumental music, choral music, dance and drama, and was not organized strictly by grade, but permitted students to advance as soon as their abilities allowed. Murray explained: Fourth through sixth grades will be together in classes. Teaching will often be done in teams. Art students will design scenery for plays, written by drama students. Music pupils will supply the music. They work together regardless of age. In reading classes they will read according to their own individual levels. A brilliant music student, capable of interpreting Beethoven's <b>wildest</b> <b>dreams,</b> might stumble on fifth level reading. This does not make him a dunce simply a slow reader.|$|E
5|$|Gateshead International Stadium {{has been}} used for many years as a concert venue. On 31 July 1982, The Police {{performed}} at the stadium as part of their Ghost in the Machine Tour, with U2 as a supporting act. Reports in the local press suggested that The Police seemed disappointed that the stadium was only half full and cited high ticket prices and poor weather as possible causes. On 16 June 1992 Guns N' Roses, supported by Soundgarden and Faith No More, performed at the stadium. This time the weather was hot and sunny which helped ensure that the concert, part of the Use Your Illusion Tour, was a sell-out. American rock group Bon Jovi have played twice at the stadium. The first occasion was on 27 June 1995, while supported by Skin, on their These Days Tour. The group returned to Gateshead on 22 August 2000 as part of their Crush Tour. Another artist who has performed multiple times at Gateshead International Stadium is Tina Turner. As part of her , Turner performed twice on consecutive nights (2122 July 1990) and attracted a total of 60,000 spectators. Turner performed for a third time at the stadium as part of her <b>Wildest</b> <b>Dreams</b> Tour on 12 July 1996. Other artists to have played at the stadium include Bryan Adams, Rod Stewart, Simple Minds and Simply Red.|$|E

25|$|Simultaneously Blethyn {{continued}} {{working on}} stage and in British television. Between 1990 and 1996 she starred in five different plays, including An Ideal Husband at the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester, Tales from the Vienna Woods and <b>Wildest</b> <b>Dreams</b> with the Royal Shakespeare Company and her American stage debut Absent Friends, for which eventually received a Theatre World Award for Outstanding New Talent. Besides she played character parts in the BBC adaptation of Hanif Kureishi's The Buddha of Suburbia and the ITV cricketing comedy-drama series Outside Edge, based on the play by television writer Richard Harris. Blethyn also performed {{in a variety of}} episodes of Alas Smith & Jones and Maigret.|$|E
25|$|Parson Levett {{had taken}} to his new sideline. Apparently he was a natural, so {{efficient}} that the Privy Council appointed him in 1546 to oversee the Sussex iron mines {{that had belonged to}} the attainted Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk and were confiscated by the Crown. Levett employed master gun founders Charles Garrete and Pierre Baude at his Buxted furnace, as well as five other aliens (probably Frenchmen) in 1543, and six in 1550. By 1543 Levett was the leading supplier of cast-iron muzzle-loading cannons to the English forces. The discovery of one of Levett's two-pound cannons marked with the monogram of King Henry VIII and dated 1543 – seized by the Spanish in Oudewater in the Netherlands in 1575 – proved that Levett succeeded beyond his <b>wildest</b> <b>dreams.</b>|$|E
500|$|Turner {{returned}} in 1995 with the U2 composition, [...] "GoldenEye" [...] for the James Bond {{film of the}} same name. Its huge success in Europe and modest success in her native United States led Turner to record a new album, releasing the <b>Wildest</b> <b>Dreams</b> album in 1996. Though the album itself was not as hugely successful in the United States, thanks to a world tour and a much played Hanes hosiery commercial, the album went gold in the United States. The album reached platinum success in Europe where Turner had hits with [...] "Whatever You Want", [...] "Missing You", which briefly charted in the U.S., [...] "Something Beautiful Remains", and the sensual Barry White duet, [...] "In Your Wildest Dreams." [...] Following the tour's end in 1997, Turner took another break before re-emerging again in 1999 appearing on the VH-1 special Divas Live '99.|$|E

500|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the Tower of Joy, actor Robert Aramayo was cast to play a young Eddard Stark. In an interview with Access Hollywood, Aramayo stated {{that he was a}} big fan of the series, and that [...] "it was an honor and a gift {{to be able to be}} a part of it." [...] In regards to portraying the character similar to Sean Bean, who played Eddard Stark in the first season, Aramayo noted, [...] "I didn't want to get too hung up in sounding like Sean because I think that would've sort of got in my way if I'd have just situated all my work in that place. I watched a lot of footage of him playing Ned in the first season again, repeatedly, especially one particular fight scene that he was in and I think that was the biggest help for me when creating this version of Ned – was watching what Sean did with Ned in the first season and trying to work out what a younger man's version of that is." [...] In a separate interview with The Hollywood Reporter Aramayo spoke about auditioning for the role, stating, [...] "The chance to audition to be on the show was a dream, even to audition. It was an absolute dream to me. I was very excited to audition, and landing the role was beyond my <b>wildest</b> <b>dreams.</b> Then when I found out the role was Ned, it was overwhelming." ...|$|E
500|$|Businessweek {{attributed}} the sales success of Mandatory Fun to the viral music video campaign. ABC World News elaborated that Yankovic's success {{is in part}} due to the Internet's interest in viral and humorous videos catching up with what Yankovic has been doing for his entire career. Yankovic himself was amazed with the response he got from the album and video releases, stating that [...] "I've been doing the same thing for 30 years {{and all of a sudden}} I'm having the best week of my life" [...] and that he [...] "kind of stumbled on my formula for the future". He also stated, [...] "A No. 1 album is something I never had in my <b>wildest</b> <b>dreams</b> ever thought would be a reality." [...] The total collection of videos had acquired more than 46 million views within 10 days of the album's release, and six of the eight videos reached the top position on the Billboard Twitter Real-Time Trending 140 chart during that week. In contrast, Yankovic's video for [...] "Perform This Way", the lead single off Alpocalypse, only received 16.8 million views in the three years since its release, while an individual video from Mandatory Fun, like [...] "Tacky", received 12.8 million views within the first week. His exposure on social networks jumped 3,391% between the weeks of July 7–13 and July 14–20, giving him more exposures than Beyoncé, Jay-Z, and Justin Timberlake.|$|E

2500|$|The {{selected}} {{design was}} very controversial, in particular its unconventional design, its black color and {{its lack of}} ornamentation.

Said Webb, “I never in my <b>wildest</b> <b>dreams</b> imagined such a nihilistic slab of stone.” [...] James Watt, Secretary of the Interior under President Ronald Reagan, initially refused to issue a building permit for the memorial due to the public outcry about the design.|$|E

2500|$|On June 19, 2007, Fator {{made his}} first {{national}} appearance on America's Got Talent.

So I figured I'd do three episodes like he did and end up on 'David Letterman.'" [...] After winning the show, Fator actually had to turn the Letterman gig down fourteen times before his schedule was clear so he could appear. [...] "My schedule got so packed, and it broke my heart every time I had to turn him down," [...] Fator says.|$|E

He won Het Volk and Liège–Bastogne–Liège before sinking into a doping controversy that was never satisfactorily explained (see below) - even though VDB was cleared by the courts. The team suspended him while the allegations were investigated and relations with their star rider never recovered. When he came back, he showed well in the '99 Vuelta before, remarkably, managing to finish in the front group of the world championship despite fracturing both hands en route. Contractually obliged to stay with Cofidis, VDB had a poor 2000 season. By this point, people in cycling were talking more about VDB's nights out than his riding." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{crossing}} gate struck {{the top of}} Brody's SUV before sliding down its rear and becoming stuck. Hope backed up to give her room to do the same.

[...] "She wasn't in a hurry at all, {{but she had to}} have known that a train was coming." [...] Brody looked at him, and he motioned to her to come back in his direction, although he allows that she may not have seen him due to the glare from his headlights. Brody then returned to her vehicle and, according to Hope, seemed to pause as if she was adjusting her seat belt. The train was getting closer and the situation more urgent.

Eleven of the songs were previewed at the album party but not all were completely mixed, mastered or finished. The album's first single [...] "Put It Down" [...] featuring Chris Brown has a distinctly hip-hop flavour, with Norwood taking on her [...] "rap-singing" [...] vocal performance she last used when assuming her persona of Bran'Nu on Timbaland's album Shock Value II (2009). The song is built around a [...] "mid-tempo thumping production" [...] courtesy of Bangladesh. Its co-writer and co-producer Sean Garrett revealed that [...] "Put It Down" [...] was a [...] "good segway" [...] to {{what the rest of the}} album would sound like. By contrast not all of Garrett's songs follow the same flow. The album's second single, titled [...] "Wildest Dreams", was also written by Garrett, but this time produced by The Bizzness. An introspective ballad, [...] "Wildest Dreams" [...] speaks about Norwood's losing out emotionally. Lyrics include the line [...] "Never in my <b>wildest</b> <b>dreams</b> did I think someone could care 'bout me/ Not just the way you love me, but you know I'm emotional (sometimes)."
