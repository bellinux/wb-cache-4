40|$|Abstract- Digital <b>watermarking</b> is {{referred}} to a method used for copyright protection and authentication. In this paper, we present a method of nested digital <b>watermark</b> embedding and extraction in which a nested <b>watermark</b> (a <b>watermark</b> inside another <b>watermark)</b> is embedded into the main image. This concept of nested <b>watermarking</b> is used to increase the <b>watermark</b> embedding capacity. In this method, a <b>watermark</b> is embedded into another <b>watermark</b> which is considered as the main <b>watermark</b> and then this main <b>watermark</b> is embedded into the cover image (main image). These <b>watermarks</b> are encrypted before embedding {{in order to have}} increased safety, thus to perform encryption and decryption process we used the Blowfish algorithm. Therefore, our research work is focused on increasing the embedding capacity and improving security of the <b>watermarks...</b>|$|R
5|$|Since 1922, nine Irish {{definitive}} stamp series {{have been}} released. Besides different designs, there were changes involving the watermark and eventually {{doing away with}} <b>watermarked</b> paper, changes in currency were also reflected on the stamps: decimalisation in 1971, and Euro changeover in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The first twelve stamps, the low {{values up to}} 1 shilling, {{were issued}} during 1922–1923, while the three high values, 2/6, 5/- and 10/-, did not appear until 8 September 1937. Designs included: Sword of Light, Map of Ireland, Celtic Cross, Arms of the Four Provinces and St. Patrick. Watermark and extra values were made until new designs, known as the Gerl definitives, using early Irish art motifs, were {{produced}} in 1968. These were the first new designs in 31 years for the high values and 46 years for the low values. The Gerl series was denominated initially in pre-decimal Irish pounds and later in decimal currency (both <b>watermarked</b> issues). It latterly appeared as unwatermarked stamps.|$|E
5|$|Precautions {{were taken}} to prevent secrets from the season finale being revealed; only certain staff members were {{provided}} with copies of the episode, which were given on <b>watermarked</b> DVDs and distributed to secret hiding places. The writers wanted Michael {{to have a big}} plan to get Holly back, but to realize throughout {{the course of the day}} that his relationship with Holly was something special and that he did not want to disrupt it; they felt it showed that Michael had become more mature, calm and confident about this relationship than that of Jan Levinson and others in his past. The first scene with Michael and Holly discussing their sketch possibilities in a secluded area was filmed with three cameras: one focusing on each side of the two actors, and one from the front of both of them to establish that the picnic was still going on behind them. Due to space limitations, the latter angle was filmed through a mirror (with the actors appearing to be opposite sides) and then the image was reversed and undistorted in post-production.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a digital image <b>watermarking</b> scheme using feature point detection and <b>watermark</b> template match. The digital image <b>watermarking</b> scheme, which is robust against {{a variety of}} common image processing attacks and geometric distortions. The image content is represented by important feature points obtained by our image-texture-based adaptive Harris detector. we take the original image and <b>watermark</b> image then we calculate the k- harries points (sharp points) on the original image. Now, the <b>watermark</b> image is resized because {{it is necessary that}} the <b>watermark</b> image is smaller than original image. Then the <b>watermark</b> image is divided into blocks in matrix. The <b>watermark</b> image is embedded into the original image. Then the harries points and image blocks extracted which gives the other <b>watermark</b> embedded image. The <b>watermark</b> image is compared with the embedded <b>watermark</b> image. To increase the embedding capacity the concept of <b>watermark</b> in <b>watermark</b> is used. To increase security we embed encrypted <b>watermarks</b> in the image.

5|$|Surcharges {{imposed by}} the Irish post office on mail bearing {{insufficient}} pre-paid postage had the postage due collected {{by the use of}} these labels. Since 1925 there have been six series printed, with the design remaining the same until 1980, though the colour and watermarks have changed. The Irish word pingin, for penny, is used in both £.s.d and decimal currency, but because it has the same meaning in each, the value on the label does not indicate whether the label was issued before or after decimalisation. Hence, identifying the issue of a label requires further information: if collectors knows the date of use, the existence of a watermark and if so which type, and the specific colour, identification will be easier. For example, the 3d value was blue between 1940 and 1969, and stone colour from 1971 until 1980; it changed from a <b>watermarked</b> to a non-watermark paper in 1978. Additionally, the 1, 5 and 8 pence values are seen in two different colours depending on the issue, while the d, 1d, 2d and 6d are seen with both watermark varieties. Except for the sixth issue, which has the word Éire in the design, there is no explicit country identity on any of the others. The first four series use only Irish words.|$|E
25|$|The {{information}} to be embedded in a signal is called a digital watermark, although in some contexts the phrase digital watermark means {{the difference between the}} <b>watermarked</b> signal and the cover signal. The signal where the watermark is to be embedded is called the host signal. A watermarking system is usually divided into three distinct steps, embedding, attack, and detection. In embedding, an algorithm accepts the host and the data to be embedded, and produces a <b>watermarked</b> signal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recently, {{a variety}} of digital <b>watermarking</b> schemes have been {{developed}} for copyright protection of digital images. In robust <b>watermarking,</b> which is used in copyright protection, transform-based algorithms are used to ensure resilience of the <b>watermark</b> to common signal processing attacks. The most frequently used <b>watermarking</b> algorithms for additive <b>watermark</b> embedding involve DCT, DFT, SVD and DWT domains. In this article we verify which domain is optimal for robust, the additive <b>watermark</b> embedding scheme. We demonstrate that in additive <b>watermark</b> embedding the embedding domain plays more important role than the embedding formula.

40|$|Three novel blind <b>watermarking</b> {{techniques}} are proposed to embed <b>watermarks</b> into digital images for different purposes. The <b>watermarks</b> {{are designed to}} be decoded or detected without the original images. The first one, called single <b>watermark</b> embedding (SWE), is used to embed a <b>watermark</b> bit sequence into digital images using two secret keys. The second technique, called multiple <b>watermark</b> embedding (MWE), extends SWE to embed multiple <b>watermarks</b> simultaneously in the same <b>watermark</b> space while minimizing the <b>watermark</b> (distortion) energy. The third technique, called iterative <b>watermark</b> embedding (IWE), embeds <b>watermarks</b> into JPEG-compressed images. The iterative approach of IWE can prevent the potential removal of a <b>watermark</b> in the JPEG recompression process. Experimental results show that embedded <b>watermarks</b> using the proposed techniques can give good image quality and are robust in varying degree to JPEG compression, low-pass filtering, noise contamination, and print-and-scan...|$|R

Denominations not included in this printing are the 3, 4, 5 and 6-cent stamps as there were still adequate stocks of these available. Of special interest is the first appearance of the 7-cent Washington-head, with its premier color of black, issued on April 29, 1914. An estimated 5 million 7-cent stamps were printed, a relatively low number for a definitive issue. It was available in post offices for only five months, for this denomination went through a perforation change in the next series, thus making it a new and separate issue.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Digital <b>watermarking</b> is {{a process}} of {{embedding}} unobtrusive marks or labels into digital content.

40|$|The goal of <b>watermarking</b> is to hide message (usually called cover message / CM). In public <b>watermarking</b> scheme, we couldn’t detect <b>watermarking</b> if the <b>watermarking</b> is changed. Besides that, {{in public}} <b>watermarking</b> scheme, cover message couldn’t be recovered. Whereas, in private <b>watermarking</b> scheme, to detect <b>watermarking,</b> {{we should know}} the private key. Those two schemes have {{benefits}} and weaknesses. In semi public <b>watermarking,</b> we could use private key to detect <b>watermark</b> if there are attacks on <b>watermarking</b> and private key {{could be used to}} extract cover message.

It is {{the first}} series to include the 11-cent denomination with the Franklin and Oak leaves design, colored slate-green, which appears again in the following two series of 1916 and 1917. Lower values of the series are printed from plates of 400 on single-line <b>watermarked</b> paper, while the one-dollar Franklin is printed from plates of 200 subjects and uses double-line <b>watermarked</b> paper of the appropriate size. Because of stamp separation problems in previous issues using gauge 12 perforations, particularly when attempting to tear a block of stamps from the sheet to cover postage on parcels, this series was instead issued with gauge 10. The perforations of this gauge would soon {{prove to be a}} problem also, as the coarser gauge of perforation made it more difficult to separate stamps, often resulting in torn stamps.|$|E

40|$|For most <b>watermarking</b> methods, {{preserving}} the synchronization between the <b>watermark</b> {{embedded in a}} digital data (image, audio or video) and the <b>watermark</b> detector {{is critical to the}} success of the <b>watermark</b> detection process. Many digital <b>watermarking</b> attacks exploit this fact by disturbing the synchronization of the <b>watermark</b> and the <b>watermark</b> detector, and thus disabling proper <b>watermark</b> detection without having to actually remove the <b>watermark</b> from the data. Some techniques have been proposed in the literature to deal with this problem. Most of these techniques employ methods to reverse the distortion caused by the attack and then try to detect the <b>watermark</b> from the repaired data.
