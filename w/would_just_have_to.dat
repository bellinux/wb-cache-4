500|$|After {{releasing}} the book, John Lennon, My Brother—written with Giuliano, and a foreword by McCartney—Baird travelled to New York during 1989 {{to appear at}} a Beatlefest convention, and was {{asked if she could}} prove she was really Lennon's half-sister. Baird declined, saying {{she was not going to}} produce her passport, and the audience <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take her word for it. In 2000, Baird was present at the unveiling of six road signs, erected on major routes into Liverpool, saying, [...] "Liverpool welcomes you – to the birthplace of THE BEATLES", and in October she planted a tree in Liverpool's Peace Gardens to commemorate Lennon's birthday.|$|E
500|$|Babayane and Mshete {{had arrived}} back in Bulawayo in August, {{accompanied}} by Maund, and Lobengula had immediately written again to Whitehall, reaffirming that [...] "If the Queen hears that I have given away the whole country, {{it is not}} so." [...] But this letter only reached the Colonial Office in London in late October, too late to make a difference. Meanwhile, the British appointed an official resident in Bulawayo, as Lobengula had requested; much to the king's indignation, it was Moffat. Maund counselled Lobengula that the concession was legal beyond doubt and that he <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> accept it. Lobengula rued the situation to Helm: [...] "Did you ever see a chameleon catch a fly? The chameleon gets behind the fly and remains motionless for some time, then he advances very slowly and gently, first putting forward one leg and then another. At last, when well within reach, he darts out his tongue and the fly disappears. England is the chameleon and I am that fly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though {{the bridge}} itself was {{finished}} {{in good time}} (in March 1904), {{it was to be}} the following October before the approaches were completed by the Public Works Department. [...] The delays frustrated locals {{to the extent that they}} made representations to the government over their concerns at the lack of progress. [...] The response was to the effect that there was a lack of resources – both men and money – for the government to devote to railway construction, especially considering all the other railway projects under-way at the time, and that Nelson <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wait its turn.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dearest, if a {{minister}} doesn't behave as a gentleman {{we are not}} bound to respect his coat-tails. I know I <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> loved <b>to</b> see Jimmy Perry's coat-tails burning up. It must have been fun." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye! And you <b>just</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{stand and}} see them go," [...] said Captain MacWhirr, showing a certain animation. [...] "It's a dead calm, isn't it?" ...|$|R
60|$|Bent on {{showing that}} he was not offended, he made himself as {{agreeable}} as possible, wound cotton for Meg, recited poetry to please Jo, shook down cones for Beth, and helped Amy with her ferns, proving himself a fit person to belong to the 'Busy Bee Society'. In the midst of an animated discussion on the domestic habits of turtles (one of those amiable creatures having strolled up from the river), the faint sound of a bell warned them that Hannah had put the tea 'to draw', and they <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> time <b>to</b> get home to supper.|$|R
2500|$|Stilwell appealed {{directly}} to President Roosevelt {{for help with}} his dispute with Chiang, and as a result, Roosevelt sent Chiang a message which read: [...] "I have urged time and again in recent months that you take drastic action to resist the disaster which has been moving closer to China and to you. Now, when you have not yet placed General Stilwell in command of all forces in China, {{we are faced with}} the loss of a critical area... with possible catastrophic consequences". Roosevelt ended his ultimatum to Chiang with the threat to end all American aid unless Chiang [...] "at once" [...] place Stilwell [...] "in unrestricted command of all your forces." [...] General Chennault later claimed that Stilwell had deliberately ordered Sino-American forces out of Guilin as a way of creating a crisis that would force Chiang to give up command of his armies to Stilwell. Stilwell's diary supports Chennault's claim as Stilwell wrote that if a crisis emerged that was [...] "just sufficient {{to get rid of the}} Peanut without entirely wrecking the ship, it would be worth it", going on to write that the entire Kuomintang system had to be [...] "torn to bits" [...] and Chiang <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go.|$|E
60|$|But Reddy is {{something}} of a philosopher. That fat hen was gone, and there was no use in wasting time puzzling over it. There were other fat hens where that one came from, and he <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> catch another.|$|E
6000|$|Now I {{had made}} all these reasonings before {{and found no}} very good reply to them; so I put on all the {{simplicity}} I could. [...] "In that case, sir," [...] said I, [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be hanged--would I not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Maida {{had saved}} $18 after {{eight months of}} economy; and this had bought the goods for the purple dress and paid Schlegel $4 on the making of it. On the day before Thanksgiving she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> enough <b>to</b> pay the {{remaining}} $4. And then for a holiday in a new dress--can earth offer anything more enchanting? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} help it, my dear. You would force me to admit there was some truth in the story Captain Forster told you, and I was, therefore, obliged to acquaint him with the fact or he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> cause <b>to</b> reproach me. Besides, you spoke of despising {{a man who was}} not {{physically}} brave." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kozlowski, {{commenting on}} his trial in a March 2007 {{interview}} with the CBS television newsmagazine 60 Minutes, told Morley Safer, [...] "I was a guy sitting in a courtroom making $100 million a year and I think a juror sitting there <b>just</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say, 'All that money? He {{must have done something}} wrong.' I think it's as simple as that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I am, and I'm {{the person}} most concerned. Of course I didn't use just those words: I was {{perfectly}} civil, quite as civil as she. But I told her I didn't consider {{she had a}} right to put me any such question. I said I wasn't sure that even Mona had, with the extraordinary line, you know, that Mona has taken. At any rate the whole thing, the way I put it, was between Mona and me; and between Mona and me, if she didn't mind, it <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> remain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With your father, you know. He doesn't know, but he'll have to." [...] Her [...] "have" [...] {{sounded like}} [...] "'ave." [...] She explained, with many more such sounds, {{that she was}} Mrs. Godfrey, {{that they had been}} married seven mortal months. If Godfrey was going abroad she must go with him, and the only way she could go with him would be for his father to do something. He was afraid of his father--that was clear; he was afraid even to tell him. What she had come down for was to see some other member of the family face to face--"fice to fice," [...] Mrs. Godfrey called it--and try if he couldn't be {{approached}} by another side. If no one else would act then she <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> act herself. The Colonel would have to do something--that was the only way out of it.|$|E
60|$|The natives {{traveled}} third class, and at marvelously cheap rates. They {{were packed}} and crammed into cars that held each about fifty; {{and it was}} said that often a Brahmin of the highest caste was thus brought into personal touch, and consequent defilement, with persons of the lowest castes--no doubt a very shocking thing if a body could understand it and properly appreciate it. Yes, a Brahmin who didn't own a rupee and couldn't borrow one, might have to touch elbows with a rich hereditary lord of inferior caste, inheritor of an ancient title a couple of yards long, and he <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> stand it; for if either of the two was allowed to go in the cars where the sacred white people were, it probably wouldn't be the august poor Brahmin. There was an immense string of those third-class cars, for the natives travel by hordes; and a weary hard night of it the occupants would have, no doubt.|$|E
6000|$|Penelope {{answered}} with her laugh. [...] "Yes! You've just missed the most delightful call, 'Rene. So easy and pleasant every way. Not a bit stiff! Mrs. Corey was so friendly! She didn't make one feel {{at all as}} if she'd bought me, and thought she'd given too much; and mother held up {{her head as if}} she were all wool and a yard wide, and she <b>would</b> <b>just</b> like <b>to</b> <b>have</b> anybody deny it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Bravo!' said Janet, {{clapping}} her hands. She <b>would</b> <b>just</b> then <b>have</b> pretended <b>to</b> {{like almost}} anything, in her pleasure at being appealed to by her husband, {{and she really}} did like {{to laugh at the}} Tryanites. 'We'll set about it directly, and sketch it out before you go to the office. I've got Tryan's sermons up-stairs, but I don't think there's anything in them we can use. I've only just looked into them; they're not at all what I expected--dull, stupid things--nothing of the roaring fire-and-brimstone sort that I expected.' ...|$|R
50|$|Lupe Velez (Yasmien Kurdi) is {{born into}} poverty but {{dreams of a}} better life. She cares for her {{crippled}} mother Metring (Gina Alajar) who is also her harshest critic. Poor, crippled persons normally engender feelings of pity, but Lupe's mother adds to the burden and is the metaphor that represents {{the title of the}} movie (Lupe carries her mother as she begs for alms). Lupe tries to make her mother see that there is still hope in life if she <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> the strength <b>to</b> believe in her own daughter. Lupe's childhood friend, Carding (JC De Vera), on the other hand, supports her in all of her ambitions and dreams.|$|R
60|$|Now Paddy the Beaver can see {{at night}} just as Reddy Fox and Peter Rabbit and Bobby Coon can, {{and he likes}} the night best, because he feels safest then. But he {{can see in the}} daytime too, and when he feels that he is {{perfectly}} safe and no one is watching, he works then too. Of course, {{the first thing to do}} was to build a dam across the Laughing Brook to make the pond he so much needed. He chose a low, open place deep in the Green Forest, around the edge of which grew many young aspen trees, the bark of which is his favorite food. Through the middle of this open place flowed the Laughing Brook. At the lower edge was just the place for a dam. It would not have to be very long, and when it was finished and the water was stopped in the Laughing Brook, it <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> flow over the low, open place and make a pond there. Paddy's eyes twinkled when he first saw it. It was right then that he made up his mind to stay in the Green Forest.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Quack {{stopped and}} shivered. [...] "It {{seems to me}} I have heard nothing but the noise of those terrible guns ever since we started," [...] said she. [...] "I haven't had a good square meal for days and days, nor a good rest. That is what makes me so dreadfully nervous. Sometimes, when we had been driven {{from place to place}} until we had caught up with Jack Frost, there would be nothing but ice {{excepting}} in small places in a river where the water runs too swiftly to freeze. We <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> drop into one of these to rest a little, because we had flown so far that our wings ached as if they would drop off. Then just as we would think we were safe for a little while, there would come the bang of a terrible gun. Then we would have to fly again as long as we could, and finally come back to the same place because there was no other place where we could go. Then we would have {{to do it all over}} again until night came. Sometimes I think that those men with terrible guns must hate us and want to kill every one of us. If they didn't, they would have a little bit of pity. They simply haven't any hearts at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{had only}} been for five minutes, in the wing, amid jostling and {{shuffling}} and shoving, that they held this conference. Miriam, splendid in a brocaded anachronism, a false dress {{of the beginning of}} the century, and excited and appealing, imperious, reckless and good-humoured, full of exaggerated propositions, supreme determinations and comic irrelevancies, showed as radiant a young head as the stage had ever seen. Other people quickly surrounded her, and Peter saw that though, she wanted, as she said, a fresh ear and a fresh eye she was liable to rap out to those who possessed these advantages that they didn't know what they were talking about. It was rather hard for her victims--Basil Dashwood let him into this, wonderfully painted and in a dress even more beautiful than Miriam's, that of a young dandy under Charles the Second: if you were not in the business you were one kind of donkey and if you were in the business you were another kind. Peter noted with a certain chagrin that Gabriel Nash had failed; he preferred to base his annoyance on that ground when the girl, after the remark just quoted from Dashwood, laughing and saying that at any rate the thing would do because it <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do, thrust vindictively but familiarly into the young actor's face a magnificent feather fan. [...] "Isn't he too lovely," [...] she asked, [...] "and doesn't he know how to do it?" [...] Dashwood had the sense of costume even more than Peter had inferred or supposed he minded, inasmuch as it now appeared he had gone profoundly into the question of what the leading lady was to wear. He had drawn patterns and hunted up stuffs, had helped her to try on her clothes, had bristled with ideas and pins. It would not have been quite clear, Peter's ground for resenting Nash's cynical absence; it may even be thought singular he should have missed him. At any rate he flushed a little when their young woman, of whom he inquired whether she hadn't invited her oldest and dearest friend, made answer: [...] "Oh he says he doesn't like the kitchen-fire--he only wants the pudding!" [...] It would have taken the kitchen-fire to account at that point for the red of Sherringham's cheek; and he was indeed uncomfortably heated by helping to handle, as he phrased it, the saucepans.|$|E
50|$|Middleton {{arrived at}} Tidore on 27 March, and the {{following}} day met Thomè de Torres, captain {{of one of the}} Portuguese galleon. Middleton declared that if they would not accept peaceable trade, he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> cause <b>to</b> join the Dutch in war against them. The Red Dragon traded successfully and remained at Tidore for the next three weeks, acquiring all but 80 bahars. of the cloves on the island. The remaining cloves were unavailable as they belonged to Portuguese merchants of Malacca Town.|$|R
60|$|Already she {{had sent}} him twenty pounds, and never written {{to explain to him}} why it was she had not sent it back sharply {{directly}} he returned it. She ought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> written at once and told him exactly what had happened. Now if she sent fifteen pounds the suggestion that she had spent a five-pound note in the meanwhile would be irresistible. No! That was impossible. She <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> keep the fifteen pounds until she could make it twenty. That might happen on her birthday--in August.|$|R
5000|$|Size nonwithstanding, the Javan or Bartels's wood-owl {{seems an}} {{especially}} promising candidate {{to resolve the}} ahool enigma: it has a conspicuous flat [...] "face" [...] with large dark eyes exaggerated by black rings of feathers and a beak that protrudes but little, and it appears greyish-brown when seen from below. Its call is characteristic, a single shout, given intermittently, and sounding like HOOOH!. Like most large owls, it is highly territorial in breeding season and will frighten away intruders by mock attacks from above and behind. Its flight, being an owl, is nearly completely silent, so that the victim of such sweeps usually only becomes aware of the owl when it homes in, diving with outstretched talons (held at [...] "breast" [...] height to the observer), and they <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> time <b>to</b> duck away. The Javan wood-owl is a decidedly rare and elusive bird not often observed even by ornithologists, as it hides during day. It is found in remote montane forest at altitudes of probably around 1,000-1,500 meters, and does not well tolerate human encroachment, logging and other disturbances.|$|R
50|$|In April 2017, as {{the twentieth}} anniversary {{approached}} for Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, Mike Myers claimed he {{would love to}} do another Austin Powers film, but you <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> see. Two days later, Roach stated that a fourth film would only occur if Myers creates a good story for it. On May 26, 2017, Troyer stated that Mini-Me will reveal that he can speak in the fourth movie.|$|E
5000|$|A former {{employee}} from the Manchester office of A4e reports that pressure to meet quotas made fraud commonplace: 'Forging signatures {{used to go}} on all the time. You had no choice because it was made very clear {{to you that you}} would lose your job unless you reached your targets. If you couldn’t get enough so-called [...] "job outcomes", you <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> forge one, so you would find a genuine employer’s signature on another form and hold it up to the window under a blank one. It appeared everyone did it and nobody ever questioned it.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, but I {{ought to}} warn you," [...] I began; and then bethought me that I was {{the bearer of}} the purse, and it would never do to seem too churlish.

5000|$|Although it {{has been}} rumored {{that at this point}} the project was {{repurposed}} to be a sequel to the 1985 Arnold Schwarzenegger action film Commando, scriptwriter de Souza has denied this. De Souza has said he wrote the script as if Hans Gruber were the protagonist. [...] "If he had not planned the robbery and put it together, Bruce Willis <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> gone <b>to</b> the party and reconciled or not with his wife. You should sometimes think about looking at your movie through {{the point of view of}} the villain who is really driving the narrative.” ...|$|R
5000|$|On 20 May 2012, Cardle {{announced}} on Twitter {{that he had}} parted ways with Columbia Records. In October 2012, Cardle explained he left Sony through his own choice because he wasn't a priority. [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> been left <b>to</b> {{get on with it}} while One Direction ruled the planet. Which is brilliant for them - I'm so proud of them - but I needed to be a bit selfish. I asked Sony to let me go and they said okay." [...] Later, in October 2013 he stated another reason for leaving was {{because of the lack of}} control he had with decisions such as [...] "Run For Your Life" [...] being released as his first single instead of [...] "Starlight" [...] which he'd written and preferred.|$|R
50|$|Overall, {{chargebacks}} {{intends to}} balance the inequality of power between consumers and businesses. It {{is regarded as a}} very efficient tool for consumers because the speed, accessibility and lack of charge for their clients, who <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> notify their banks or card issuers to cancel a transaction. Thus, Edwards and Wilson suggested that it would be advisable to focus on developing chargebacks and other soft ODR methods because they are very effective amongst mainstream consumers. By contrast, the existing processes are considered largely inefficient and not transparent among businesses because puts businesses in bad light since the onus of the proof rests on them.|$|E

5000|$|The early French {{plans were}} {{concerned}} with keeping Germany weak and strengthening the French economy {{at the expense of}} that of Germany (see the Monnet Plan). French foreign policy aimed at dismantling German heavy industry, placing the coal-rich Ruhr area and Rhineland under French control or at a minimum internationalize them, and also joining the coal-rich Saarland with the iron-rich province of Lorraine (which had been handed over from Germany to France again in 1944). When American diplomats reminded the French of what a devastating effect this would have on the German economy, France's response was to suggest the Germans <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> [...] "make the necessary adjustments" [...] to deal with the inevitable foreign exchange deficit.|$|E
6000|$|Among {{the letters}} {{was one in}} that dreaded hand writing marked [...] "Immediate," [...] and {{forwarded}} from his chambers. She took it up, {{and put it to}} her nose. A scent--of what? Too faint to say. Her thumb nails sought the edge of the flap on either side. She laid the letter down. Any other letter, but not that--she wanted to open it too much. Readdressing it, she took it out to put with the other letters. And instantly the thought went through her: 'What a pity! If I read it, and there was nothing!' All her restless, jealous misgivings of months past would then be set at rest! She stood, uncertain, with the letter in her hand. Ah--but if there WERE something! She would lose at one stroke her faith in him, and her faith in herself--not only his love but her own self-respect. She dropped the letter on the table. Could she not take it up to him herself? By the three o'clock slow train, she could get to him soon after five. She looked at her watch. She <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> time <b>to</b> walk down. And she ran upstairs. Little Gyp was sitting on the top stair--her favourite seat--looking at a picture-book.|$|R

50|$|Historically mausoleums {{have been}} used as a sign of a family’s wealth and a symbol of gentry and nobility in many countries. In the mid and late 19th century in North America, more and more {{families}} began to buy mausoleums. The belief was that it would be easier for a Resurrectionist or grave robber to dig up a grave rather than to topple down iron or steel doors guarding the mausoleum. A flaw {{in the design of the}} mausoleum was the stained glass or other windows within. Almost every family between the 18th and 19th century had a religious affiliation. As such, many of these families (usually with a Christian affiliation) would put stained glass within the mausoleums. The grave robbers <b>would</b> then <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> smash the glass to break in and to retrieve the body. Making it even easier, around the 1830s families began to fear burying family members. The living relatives would stand guard inside the mausoleum and would sometimes get trapped—only to be discovered upon the death of the next family member. To remedy this, families would put a spare key somewhere within the mausoleum and create doors with two way locks. In short, grave robbers could break a window, recover the body, find the key, and walk straight out the front door of the mausoleum.|$|R
