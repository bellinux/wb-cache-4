5|$|Having {{pushed the}} Crusaders out {{of most of}} Syria, the Ayyubids {{generally}} adopted a policy of peace <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> <b>The</b> war with the Crusaders did not prevent Muslims under Ayyubid governance from developing good commercial relations with European states. This led to fruitful interaction between both sides in different fields of economic activity, particularly in agriculture and trade.|$|E

5|$|A {{persistent}} folktale on Sumatra and Borneo and {{in popular}} culture, is that male orangutans display sexual attraction to human women, {{and may even}} forcibly copulate <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> <b>The</b> only serious, but anecdotal, report of such an incident taking place, is primatologist Birutė Galdikas' report that her cook was sexually assaulted by a male orangutan. This orangutan, though, was raised in captivity and may have suffered from a skewed species identity, and forced copulation is a standard mating strategy for low-ranking male orangutans.|$|E
5|$|A salvage {{attempt was}} ordered by Secretary of State William Paget only {{days after the}} sinking, and Charles Brandon, the king's brother-in-law, took charge of {{practical}} details. The operation followed the standard procedure for raising ships in shallow waters: strong cables were attached to the sunken ship and fastened to two empty ships, or hulks. At low tide, the ropes were pulled taut with capstans. When the high tide came in, the hulks rose and <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>the</b> wreck. It would then be towed into shallower water and the procedure repeated until the whole ship could be raised completely.|$|E

5|$|About 10,000years ago {{the humans}} who {{inhabited}} the lands around the Mediterranean basin began to domesticate wild animals. Pigs, cattle, goats, sheep, horses, camels, {{cats and dogs}} were all kept and bred in captivity. These animals would have brought their viruses <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> <b>The</b> transmission of viruses from animals to humans can occur, but such zoonotic infections are rare and subsequent human-to-human transmission of animal viruses is even rarer, although there are notable exceptions such as influenza. Most viruses are species-specific and would have posed no threat to humans. The rare epidemics of viral diseases originating in animals would have been short-lived because the viruses were not fully adapted to humans and the human populations were too small to maintain the chains of infection.|$|E
5|$|Amid {{a torrent}} of Japanese fire, the Australians broke contact and made for the landing craft, {{bringing}} the wounded out <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> <b>The</b> embarkation took only five minutes, but as the vessels attempted to depart two of them, overloaded with about 60 men on board, ran aground and stuck fast. In an effort to lighten the load, several men volunteered to leave the craft, which enabled one of the vessels to float free. The other, however, remained stuck. Coming under attack from the Japanese, some of whom waded out and attacked {{the men in the}} vessel with grenades, the casualties mounted, with a number of men, including Downs, being either killed or lost overboard and subsequently listed as missing, presumed killed.|$|E
5|$|Antemoro {{villages are}} {{primarily}} clustered {{in the southeastern}} coastal area near Vohipeno and Manakara. Society was traditionally divided into two broad categories: the mpanombily (or tompomenakely), who were nobles said to be descended from Arabs from Mecca, and the menakely, composed of the working and slave classes, who {{were said to have}} descended from the local Malagasy who submitted to the Arabs' rule, or alternately from slaves that the Arabs had brought <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> <b>The</b> mpanombily comprised many noble clans such as the Anakara, Onjatsy, Tsimaito, Antaiony, Antalaotra, Antaisambo, Antaimahazo and others. Particular clans within Antemoro society historically held distinct privileges and responsibilities. The butchering of certain animals for human consumption was assigned to specific clans.|$|E

5|$|As the 19th century wore on, workhouses {{increasingly}} became refuges for the elderly, infirm {{and sick}} {{rather than the}} able-bodied poor, and in 1929 legislation was passed to allow local authorities to take over workhouse infirmaries as municipal hospitals. Although workhouses were formally abolished by the same legislation in 1930, many continued under their new appellation of Public Assistance Institutions {{under the control of}} local authorities.

5|$|Devil Daggers is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} {{and published by}} indie development team Sorath. Players are tasked with surviving {{for as long as}} possible against swarms of demonic enemies on an arena shrouded in darkness. The player character can fire daggers from their fingers to eliminate foes and move about to avoid contact <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> <b>The</b> player dies upon touching an enemy, and as time passes, more threatening creatures begin to appear. Survival times are recorded on a global leaderboard where replays of playthroughs can be accessed and viewed. The deliberate use of unfiltered textures and effects like polygon jitter and texture warping make its visual style reminiscent of early 3D games released in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Distant {{regions of}} space {{are assumed to}} exist and {{to be part of}} reality as much as we are, even though we can never {{interact}} <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> <b>The</b> spatial region that we can affect and be affected by is the observable universe. The observable universe depends on the location of the observer. By traveling, an observer can come into contact with a greater region of spacetime than an observer who remains still. Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler {{will not be able to}} interact with all of space. Typically, the observable universe is taken to mean the portion of the Universe that is observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} Julio-Claudian period, many {{auxiliary}} regiments raised in frontier provinces were stationed {{in or near}} their home provinces, except during periods of major crises such as the Cantabrian Wars, when they were deployed temporarily in theatre. This carried the obvious risk if their own tribe or ethnic group rebelled against Rome (or attacked the Roman frontier from outside the Empire), auxiliary troops could be tempted to make common cause <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> <b>The</b> Romans would then be faced by an enemy that included units fully equipped and trained by themselves, thus losing their usual tactical advantages over tribal foes.|$|E
5|$|Harrington died in January 1993, {{without having}} found Planet X. Six months before, E.

5|$|In 1973, mendelevium(I) was {{reported}} to have been produced by Russian scientists, who obtained it by reducing higher oxidation states of mendelevium with samarium(II). It was found to be stable in neutral water–ethanol solution and be homologous to caesium(I). However, later experiments found no evidence for mendelevium(I) and found that mendelevium behaved like divalent elements when reduced, not like the monovalent alkali metals. Nevertheless, the Russian team conducted further studies on the thermodynamics of cocrystallizing mendelevium with alkali metal chlorides, and concluded that mendelevium(I) had formed and could form mixed crystals with divalent elements, thus cocrystallizing <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> <b>The</b> status of the +1 oxidation state is still tentative.|$|E
