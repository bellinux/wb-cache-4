25|$|Water {{was brought}} to the mill in an open ditch (zanja) from Los Robles and Kewen Canyons, and stored in a large cistern. For the mill itself, Father Zalvidea {{designed}} an unusual horizontal, direct impulse water wheel. There were three vaulted <b>water</b> <b>chambers</b> on the ground floor and a single horizontal water wheel. The water wheel was attached to a vertical shaft that went up to the second level (the current entrance room) where the grinding stones were located. One of the grinding stones was attached to the shaft, and rotated along with the water wheel. A second stone was placed above the rotating stone, with corn and grain between the stones. It is suspected that the force of the water from the cistern was not sufficient to start the wheel turning with the required force, and that a leather thong was wrapped around the shaft and pulled by Indians to start the wheel. The upper-most room, used now as an art gallery, was used for storage of the final product. After the water flowed out of the mill, it was channeled into a lake down hill from the mill. The lake has since dried up and is now the site of San Marino's Lacy Park.|$|E

The casing rose at the top to form an outlet for hot gases into a funnel. The furnace was fed with coal by stokers through firebox doors at one end, and, whereas the Normand boiler required a fire of about 18inches (460mm) depth, the Reed boiler required a shallower one of between 8and 12inches (200–300mm). Air for the furnace passed through the air gap in the boiler casing, thus providing a supply of heated air that was directed {{to the rear of the}} ashpan. This admitted air through three doors that closed automatically if a tube failed, the intention being to prevent flames, steam and debris escaping into the boiler room. A constant supply of pure water was essential for this type of boiler, as a shortage of water would rapidly result in an empty boiler liable to severe damage from the furnace, and the deposition of any contaminant, such as limescale, would result in a significant loss of efficiency and could block tubes. Each boiler had its own feedwater pump, and a feedwater regulator also of Reed's design.|$|E

50|$|The Abbeystead {{disaster}} {{occurred on}} the evening of 23 May 1984 when a methane gas explosion destroyed a waterworks' valve house at Abbeystead, Lancashire, England. A group of 44 visitors was inside the underground building at the time attending a public presentation by North West Water Authority (NWWA) to demonstrate the operations of the station. Eight were killed instantly by the explosion, and the others were severely injured. The explosion also caused the concrete roof to fall down on to the group, destroying the steel mesh floor and throwing some of the victims into the <b>water</b> <b>chambers</b> below which rapidly filled with river water. Another eight people subsequently died of their injuries in hospital. An 11-year-old boy and his mother were among the dead. The official inquiry into the disaster concluded that the methane had seeped from coal deposits 3,937 feet (1,200 m) below ground and had built up in an empty pipeline. The gas was then ejected into the valve house by the sudden pressure of water as the pumps were switched on. The cause of ignition has never been determined.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAs a new {{technical}} approach, {{wave energy}} converter by using vertical motion {{of water in the}} multiple <b>water</b> <b>chambers</b> were developed to realize actual wave power generation as eco-environmental renewable energy. And practical use of {{wave energy converter}} was actually to require the following conditions: (1) setting up of the relevant device and its application to wave power generation in case that severe wave loading is avoided; (2) workability in installation and maintenance operations; (3) high energy conversion potential; and (4) low cost. In this system, neither the wall(s) of the chambers nor the energy conversion device(s) are exposed to the impulsive load due to water wave. Also since this system is profitable when set along the jetty or along a long floating body, installation and maintenance are done without difficulty and the cost is reduced. In this paper, we describe the system which consists of a float, a shaft connected with another shaft, a rack and pinion arrangement, a ratchet mechanism, and rotary type generator(s). Then, we present the dynamics model for evaluating the output electric power, and the results of numerical calculation including the effect of the phase shift of up/down motion of the water in the array of <b>water</b> <b>chambers</b> aligned along the direction of wave propagation...|$|E

The wave induced force is calculated using the boundary element method based on the velocity potential theory. Assuming air to be an ideal gas, the air flow is calculated using an equation of state and the equations of conservation of mass and energy. Boundary integral equations are formulated to calculate the air pressure in the air chambers, the reflection coefficient and the primary conversion efficiency of each of the chambers as well as the combined efficiency. In addition, the behaviour of these physical quantities with the variation of the nozzle ratio, the relative water depth, the depth of the curtain wall and the width of the front-chamber are investigated using the calculated results...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDifferences of ionic {{concentrations}} across lipid bilayers {{are some}} of the primary energetic driving forces for cellular electrophysiology. While macroscopic models of asymmetric ionic solutions are well-developed, their connection to ion, water, and lipid interactions at the atomic scale are much more poorly understood. In this study, we used molecular dynamics to examine a system of two chambers of equal ionic strength, but differing amounts of NaCl and KCl, separated by a lipid bilayer. Our expectation was that the net electrostatic potential difference between the two chambers should be small or zero. Contrary to our expectation, a large potential difference (− 70 mV) slowly evolved across the two <b>water</b> <b>chambers</b> over the course of our 172 -ns simulation. This potential primarily originated from strong Na+ binding to the carbonyls of the phosphatidylcholine lipids. This ion adsorption also led to significant structural and mechanical changes in the lipid bilayer. We discuss this surprising result in the context of indirect experimental evidence for Na+ interaction with bilayers as well as potential caveats in current biomembrane simulation methodology, including force-field parameters and finite size effects...|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{descaling}} {{is an important}} part of the forging and heat treatment of steel and semi products of steel production. Rising of new information and study of this process can increase efficiency and improve the surface quality after descaling. This thesis is focused on the mechanisms of the high pressure hydraulic descaling qualification and study of the chemical compounds of which the scales grown. To achieve all goals of this work and to get a comprehensive view of descaling process, few experimental measurements and numerical analyses were performed. All experimental measurements were focused on obtaining data about fundamental parameters and effects of the hydraulic descaling. The data obtained from measurements were applied to numerical analyses, which aimed to discover a deeper relation and to confirm the experimental results. This thesis can be divided into two main parts. The first part is devoted to parameters of the water jet study. The main studied characteristics of the high pressure hydraulic water jet were heat transfer coefficient and impact pressure at different modes such as standard or pulsating water jet. Experimentally measured data of these parameters were applied in numerical analyses. The numerical analyses were focused on studying the impact of the water jet parameters on the stresses in the oxide scale layers. A further water jet analysis was focused on the influence of the individual parts of the hydraulic system (such as water chamber or stabilizer) on its characteristics. In this part different types of the <b>water</b> <b>chambers</b> in combination with different types of stabilizers on the impact pressure values were investigated. These measurements were supported by fluid flow analysis through the hydraulic system. The second part of this work was focused on getting mechanical properties of the oxide scales from specimens prepared from standard structural steel and specimens from silicon steel. In this thesis, the influence of various parameters and characteristics was studied on these two types of steel. Mechanical properties of oxide scale structures were carried out by the Small Punch Test method. To obtain the fundamental mechanical properties such as Young´s modulus, yield strength and ultimate strength, material parameters based on the measured data were optimized. The whole work was carried out in order to get valuable and comprehensive results about high pressure hydraulic descaling process and influencing factors as well as about oxide scales themselves...|$|E
