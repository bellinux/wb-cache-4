5|$|Horseshoe crabs convert {{nitrogenous}} <b>wastes</b> to ammonia {{and dump}} it via their gills, and excrete other <b>wastes</b> as feces via the anus. They also have nephridia ("little kidneys"), which extract other <b>wastes</b> for excretion as urine. Ammonia is so toxic {{that it must}} be diluted rapidly with large quantities of water. Most terrestrial chelicerates cannot afford to use so much water and therefore convert nitrogenous <b>wastes</b> to other chemicals, which they excrete as dry matter. Extraction is by various combinations of nephridia and Malpighian tubules. The tubules filter <b>wastes</b> out of the blood and dump them into the hindgut as solids, a system that has evolved independently in insects and several groups of arachnids.|$|E

40|$|The key {{topic of}} this paper is to explain the above average {{increase}} of local <b>waste</b> charges in Germany, in addition the special importance of local within national environmental policies. The jump of <b>waste</b> charges, especially since 1990, has originated in the changed institutional setting of <b>waste</b> management, for its part a result of increasing <b>waste</b> material. It includes an expansion of <b>waste</b> management services (for instance, <b>waste</b> treatment, <b>waste</b> disposal), higher technical demands referring to <b>waste</b> disposal (<b>waste</b> incineration, <b>waste</b> disposal sites) and excess capacity of municipal incinerators resulting from a higher percentage of <b>waste</b> recycling. In addition to financing disposal and treatment, <b>waste</b> charges shall also give financial incentives to <b>waste</b> avoidance considering the social costs of <b>waste</b> management (for instance, pollutants of <b>waste</b> incineration) ("ecological <b>waste</b> charges"). The authors recommend to apply new approaches to collect charges, that give rise to <b>waste</b> avoidance and recycling.

5|$|Like other reptiles, dinosaurs are {{primarily}} uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous <b>wastes</b> from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia via the ureters into the intestine. In most living species, uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, {{at least some}} modern birds (such as hummingbirds) can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous <b>wastes</b> as ammonia.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a comprehensive analysis of municipal and packaging <b>waste</b> generation dynamics, based on panel {{data for the}} EU 15. The evidence provides some valuable policy implications since it analyses {{the extent to which}} decoupling has occurred for the two <b>waste</b> streams and if and how effectively EU <b>waste</b> policy has influenced the <b>waste</b> generation-income relationship since 1995. We demonstrate that although absolute decoupling is far from being generally achieved for both municipal and even packaging <b>waste</b> generation – both historically heavily regulated by EU directives – there are some first positive signs of stronger relative decoupling with respect to the past. Nevertheless, the impact of <b>waste</b> policies is negligible, probably due to the biased focus on <b>waste</b> disposal and recovery rather than <b>waste</b> reduction at source. <b>Waste</b> prevention should definitely become the core objective of future <b>waste</b> regulation efforts in the EU, even assigning targets in terms of <b>waste</b> generated per capita. <b>waste</b> Kuznets curves; WKC; decoupling; EU <b>waste</b> policies; policy effectiveness; panel data; MSW; packaging waste; municipal waste; European Union; <b>waste</b> income; <b>waste</b> generation; <b>waste</b> prevention; <b>waste</b> regulation; <b>waste</b> management; municipal solid <b>waste.</b> ...|$|R
