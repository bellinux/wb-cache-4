500|$|Walter Jackson Bate {{states that}} the poem has [...] "always puzzled readers [...] But finding the poem so elusive, we return to it only after we know the others far better. If we had hope to use them as keys, we {{discover}} they do not quite fit the lock. Meanwhile they have given us a standard hard to equal. Hence <b>we</b> <b>either</b> feel a disappointment about the 'Ode to Psyche' or else, remembering the care Keats supposedly gave it, we once more put the poem aside for future consideration." [...] However, he also states that [...] "The modern, respectful attitude toward this ode is deserved. But the itch for novelty has encouraged a few critics {{to suggest that the}} poem, in some dark but fundamental way, has more to it as a whole than do the later odes." ...|$|E
500|$|Second-place {{championship}} driver Edwards said {{he expected}} the top three points leaders to remain together during the race, [...] "I'll probably be glued to Jimmie, no matter where he's at. If him and Greg and I can just stay together, and make sure <b>we</b> <b>either</b> all avoid or either all get in the same wrecks, then we'll probably be all right." [...] Earnhardt said he aimed to achieve his sixth victory at Talladega Superspeedway (where he had {{a large amount of}} fan support) in an effort to move ahead in the championship standings. Gordon, who had not won so far during 2008, felt that he could win the race, and employed a strategy where he would attempt to avoid being caught up in a multi-car collision. Johnson felt the AMP Energy 500 would be [...] "interesting" [...] and [...] "a turning point in the chase".|$|E
500|$|Traditional Chinese {{literary}} criticism emphasized {{the life of}} the author when interpreting a work, a practice which Burton Watson attributes to [...] "the close links that traditional Chinese thought posits between art and morality". Since many of Du Fu's poems feature morality and history, this practice is particularly important. Another reason, identified by the Chinese historian William Hung, is that Chinese poems are typically concise, omitting context that might be relevant, but which an informed contemporary could be assumed to know. For modern Western readers, [...] "The less accurately we know the time, the place and the circumstances in the background, the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly, and the result will be that <b>we</b> <b>either</b> misunderstand the poem or fail to understand it altogether". [...] Stephen Owen suggests a third factor particular to Du Fu, arguing that the variety of the poet's work required consideration of his whole life, rather than the [...] "reductive" [...] categorizations used for more limited poets.|$|E

500|$|Alan Sepinwall of HitFix {{praised the}} episode structure, writing [...] "The quick {{transitions}} and constant back-and-forth movement among subplots generated more energy that, {{when combined with}} several characters <b>we</b> <b>either</b> didn't know before or hadn't {{seen in a long}} time, made [...] "The Broken Man" [...] feel livelier." [...] Similarly, Ed Power of The Daily Telegraph also praised the episode, noting, [...] "Once again there was a sense Game of Thrones was steeling itself for battles - and expensive set-pieces - chugging down the track. A storm is brewing - for now, we were invited to enjoy what remains of the calm." [...] Jen Chaney of Vulture also felt the episode was more of a set up episode for storylines to be resolved in the close of the season, writing [...] "Although two bombs get dropped in this week's episode of Game of Thrones, it's an hour focused on putting the narrative chess pieces into place. [...] "The Broken Man" [...] doesn't finish off any of its major moves. Those bold turns are yet to come." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which Susan, Lynette, and Gabrielle comfort Bree at the {{hospital}} was the last scene of the season involving the four principal characters. Teri Hatcher commented: [...] "It was a heavy scene. There was a very genuine and deeply felt recognition that all four of us {{together as a team}} appreciated the ride we'd had this season and were grateful that we'd survived it together." [...] An extension of the scene, in which the women discuss Susan's discovery of Martha Huber's journal, was cut for time, though it was aired on Good Morning America on May 23, 2005, one day after the episode's broadcast, and was included on the first season DVD set. The death of one housewife's husband was confirmed prior to the episode's broadcast. Steven Culp was not surprised when his character was killed off, stating [...] "I had a sneaking suspicion someone was going to go." [...] Producer and writer Kevin Murphy explained the reasoning for killing off the Rex character: [...] "As we neared the end of season 1, our plan was that each woman would enter a new life chapter. Gabrielle would learn to function without Carlos, Susan and Mike would build their relationship, Lynette would go back to work, and Bree would become a single woman. <b>We</b> <b>either</b> had to have Rex divorce her or die." [...] Cherry named the {{scene in which}} Bree finishes her spring cleaning before mourning the death of her husband as one of his top three favorites of the season, stating: [...] "It was one of the favorite things I wrote because it was so true to her character. She had to finish the cleaning she started, and she comes in and everything’s perfect." [...] A scene between Gabrielle and John was also cut for time.|$|E

So <b>we</b> <b>either</b> do it or do a half-arsed job of it or {{you can take your}} full record advance and leave." [...] The band took the advance and used it to build a {{recording}} studio in Watford in July 2013. A friend of the band had a lease on a few rehearsal rooms. The band initially wanted the room as a storage area for their equipment, but this soon changed into a storage and rehearsal area, then into a storage, rehearsal and recording studio. Sansom spent a week looking up studio equipment on Gumtree, which the band would drive to pick up. Two items of gear the band acquired was a tape machine and a 1980s recording console.|$|E
2500|$|Shannon Larkin {{explained}} how {{the band is}} able to walk the line between staying true to their roots {{and being able to}} satisfy themselves creatively, stating, [...] "Usually the riffs decide how new songs come about, with one of us showing the others a riff, and then the rest of us just jamming along until a song starts to form. If the song sounds too far from our roots (or our sound or style) then we can tell after jamming it a few times, and <b>we</b> <b>either</b> drop it or re-work it to sound more true to our roots. Satisfying ourselves creatively is pretty easy, as we aren't trying to re-invent the wheel musically - we are a blue-collar hard rock band. That said, we do side projects in which we can experiment with different textures and styles and scratch any itches to experiment in different genres." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fromm {{believed}} that freedom was {{an aspect of}} human nature that <b>we</b> <b>either</b> embrace or escape. He observed that embracing our freedom of will was healthy, whereas escaping freedom {{through the use of}} escape mechanisms was the root of psychological conflicts. Fromm outlined three of the most common escape mechanisms: automaton conformity, authoritarianism, and destructiveness. Automaton conformity is changing one's ideal self to conform to a perception of society's preferred type of personality, losing one's true self in the process. Automaton conformity displaces the burden of choice from self to society. Authoritarianism is giving control of oneself to another. By submitting one's freedom to someone else, this act removes the freedom of choice almost entirely. Lastly, destructiveness is any process which attempts to eliminate others or the world as a whole, all to escape freedom. Fromm said that [...] "the destruction of the world is the last, almost desperate attempt to save myself from being crushed by it".|$|E
2500|$|Grote uses Droysen's {{terminology}} but {{gives him}} no credit for it. Instead he attacks Droysen's concept of Alexander planting Hellenism in eastern colonies: [...] "Plutarch states that Alexander founded more than seventy new cities in Asia. So large {{a number of}} them is neither verifiable nor probable, unless <b>we</b> <b>either</b> reckon up simple military posts or borrow from the list of foundations really established by his successors." [...] He avoids Droysen's term in favor of the traditional [...] "successor". In a long note he attacks Droysen's thesis as [...] "altogether slender and unsatisfactory." [...] Grote may have been right, but he ignores entirely Droysen's main thesis, that the concepts of [...] "successors" [...] and [...] "sons of successors" [...] were innovated and perpetuated by historians writing contemporaneously or nearly so with the period. Not enough evidence survives to prove it conclusively, but enough survives to win acceptance for Droysen as the founding father of Hellenistic history.|$|E
2500|$|Rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin {{abruptly}} {{quit the}} band on November 7, 1991, after {{a repeat of}} the St. Louis incident nearly unfolded during a concert in Germany. Stradlin cited a combination of Rose's personal behavior, his mismanagement of the band, and difficulties being around Slash, Sorum, and McKagan, due to his new-found sobriety and their continuing alcohol and substance addictions. Stradlin later commented, [...] "Once I quit drugs, I couldn't help looking around and asking myself, 'Is this all there is?' I was just tired of it; I needed to get out." [...] Slash commented on finding a replacement, saying, [...] "When Izzy left, we realized that <b>we</b> <b>either</b> had to find a new guitarist in three weeks or cancel a bunch of gigs. I had a piece of paper with about 30-odd candidates listed. Duff was looking around and Axl had his ideas, but nobody seemed right. For a while it looked like Dave Navarro from Jane's Addiction was going to join, but he couldn't get it together, so that never happened." [...] Stradlin was eventually replaced by Los Angeles-based guitarist Gilby Clarke, whom Slash credited for saving the band.|$|E

2500|$|The weaker {{form of the}} theorem can {{be proven}} from the undecidability of the halting problem as follows. Assume {{that we have a}} {{consistent}} and complete axiomatization of all true first-order logic statements about natural numbers. Then we can build an algorithm that enumerates all these statements i.e. an algorithm N that, given a natural number n, computes a true first-order logic statement about natural numbers, such that for all the true statements {{there is at least one}} n such that N(n) is equal to that statement. Now suppose we want to decide whether the algorithm with representation a halts on input i. [...] By using Kleene's T predicate, we can express the statement [...] "a halts on input i" [...] as a statement H(a, i) in the language of arithmetic. Since the axiomatization is complete it follows that either there is an n such that N(n) = [...] H(a, i) or there is an n such that N(n) = ¬ H(a, i). [...] So if we iterate over all n until <b>we</b> <b>either</b> find H(a, i) or its negation, we will always halt. This means that this gives us an algorithm to decide the halting problem. Since we know that there cannot be such an algorithm, it follows that the assumption that there is a consistent and complete axiomatization of all true first-order logic statements about natural numbers must be false.|$|E
