5|$|Book of the Dead papyri {{were often}} {{the work of}} several {{different}} scribes and artists whose work <b>was</b> <b>literally</b> pasted together. It is usually possible to identify the style {{of more than one}} scribe used on a given manuscript, even when the manuscript is a shorter one. The text and illustrations were produced by different scribes; {{there are a number of}} Books where the text was completed but the illustrations were left empty.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century, {{appreciation}} of Bashō's poems grew more fervent, and commentators such as Ishiko Sekisui and Moro Nanimaru {{went to great}} length to find references in his hokku to historical events, medieval books, and other poems. These commentators were often lavish in their praise of Bashō's obscure references, {{some of which were}} probably literary false cognates. In 1793 Bashō was deified by the Shinto bureaucracy, and for a time criticizing his poetry <b>was</b> <b>literally</b> blasphemous.|$|E

5000|$|By contrast, Salmon {{maintains}} that [...] "Sherlock Holmes exists" [...] <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> true, whereas [...] "Sherlock Holmes was a detective" [...] <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> false. According to Salmon, Sherlock Holmes is a fictional character, {{a kind of}} abstract entity, created by author Arthur Conan Doyle, and the fiction is a story, or a collection of stories, which are about that very character but <b>are</b> <b>literally</b> false. Holmes really exists, but is only depicted as a detective in the fiction. In the fiction, Holmes is a detective; in reality, Holmes is merely a fictional detective.|$|R
5|$|Over 100 auditions {{were held}} before the {{suitable}} baby {{was found to}} star in the film. Benny Chan chose Matthew Medvedev, a one-year-old infant of Chinese and Colombian descent. Medvedev, known as Baby Matthew, <b>was</b> <b>literally</b> recruited off the street when an assistant director spotted him with his parents on the MTR. Although his family was simply visiting Hong Kong, they agreed to stay and let Matthew appear in Rob-B-Hood.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission of}} the Swiss Air Force {{historically}} has been to support ground troops (erdkampf) in repelling invasions of neutral Swiss territory, with a secondary mission of defending the sovereignty of Swiss airspace. During World War II this doctrine was severely tested when Switzerland <b>was</b> <b>literally</b> {{caught in the middle}} of an air war and subjected to both attacks and intrusions by aircraft of all combatants. Its inability to prevent such violations of its neutrality led for a period to a complete cessation of air intercepts, followed by a practice of coercing small numbers of intruders to submit to internment.|$|E
5|$|With no army left {{to defend}} Tigranocerta, and a foreign populace that gleefully opened the gates to the Romans, Lucullus' army began the {{wholesale}} looting and plunder of the city. The city <b>was</b> <b>literally</b> deconstructed piece by piece. The king's treasury, {{estimated to be}} worth 8,000 talents, was looted and each soldier in the army was awarded 800 drachma. The battle also resulted in severe territorial losses: most of the lands in Tigranes' empire {{to the south of}} the Taurus fell under the sway of Rome.|$|E
5000|$|Twenty (...) {{is used as}} a {{base number}} in the French {{language}} names of numbers from 70 to 99, except in the French of Belgium, Switzerland, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, the Aosta Valley and the Channel Islands. For example, , the French word for [...] "80", literally means [...] "four-twenties"; soixante-dix, the word for [...] "70", <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> [...] "sixty-ten"; [...] ("75") <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> [...] "sixty-fifteen"; quatre-vingt-sept ("87") <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> [...] "four-twenties-seven"; quatre-vingt-dix ("90") <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> [...] "four-twenties-ten"; and quatre-vingt-seize ("96") <b>is</b> <b>literally</b> [...] "four-twenties-sixteen". However, in the French of Belgium, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, the Aosta Valley, and the Channel Islands, the numbers 70 and 90 generally have the names septante and nonante. Therefore, the year 1996 is [...] "mille neuf cent quatre-vingt-seize" [...] in Parisian French, but it is [...] "mille neuf cent nonante-six" [...] in Belgian French. In Switzerland, [...] "80" [...] can be quatre-vingts (Geneva, Neuchâtel, Jura) or huitante (Vaud, Valais, Fribourg); in the past octante was also in use.|$|R

5|$|At {{the time}} of Constantine the Great (r. 306–337), barely 10% of the Roman Empire's {{population}} were Christians, with most of them being urban population and generally found {{in the eastern part}} of the Roman Empire. The majority of people still honoured the old gods in the public Roman way of religio. As Christianity became a complete philosophical system, whose theory and apologetics were heavily indebted to the Classic word, this changed. In addition, Constantine, as Pontifex Maximus, was responsible for the correct cultus or veneratio of the deity which was in accordance with former Roman practice. The move from the old religion to the new entailed some elements of continuity as well as break with the past, though the artistic heritage of paganism <b>was</b> <b>literally</b> broken by Christian zeal.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Hastings returned, {{he had decided}} to become a barrister. There were various {{problems}} with this aim: in particular, he had no money, and the training for barristers was extremely expensive. Despite this, he refused to consider a change of career, and joined the Middle Temple as a student on 4 November 1901. It is uncertain why he chose this particular Inn of Court (his uncle J. Comyns Carr, his only connection with the Bar, {{was a member of the}} Inner Temple), but the most likely explanation was that the Middle Temple was popular with Irish barristers, and Hastings was of Irish ancestry. The examinations required to become a barrister were not particularly difficult or expensive, but once a student passed all the exams he would be expected to pay the then-enormous sum of £100 when he was called to the Bar – £100 in 1901 would be worth approximately £ in 2015 – and Hastings <b>was</b> <b>literally</b> penniless.|$|E
5|$|On-set computer-generated {{effects for}} the pilot were done by Thomas Special Effects. Certain scenes, because of time and money, had to be created digitally. The opening {{sequence}} showing {{the destruction of the}} water tower by a meteor was created on the computer. A persistent problem during production was the lack of cornfields. As realistic corn was a necessity for a show based in Kansas, this became a problem for the filmmakers. Over 10,000 stalks of corn were grown in a greenhouse {{for the pilot}}, but they only grew two feet high, which was not usable to the crew. The day the crew was filming the scene for Clark's landing there were no cornfields in the surrounding area. The cornfields had to be digitally added. Digital corn was a common substitute for the undersized corn that was grown, but for scenes where digital corn was not an option, six hundred stalks of fake corn were flown in from a manufacturer in Arizona. Other digital effects include the flattened cornfield where Lex was caught in a meteorite blast. Some scenes required physical effects, instead of computer imagery. When Lex drives his car off a bridge and hits Clark, the stunt performer, who doubled as Wolverine in the film X-Men, <b>was</b> <b>literally</b> hit by the car as it went over the bridge.|$|E

25|$|Before its {{transformation}} into buildable land by a 19th-century filling project, the Back Bay <b>was</b> <b>literally</b> a bay, {{west of the}} Shawmut Peninsula (on the far side from Boston Harbor) between Boston and Cambridge, the Charles River entering from the west. This bay was tidal: the water rose and fell several feet {{over the course of}} each day, and at low tide much of the bay's bed was exposed as a marshy flat.|$|E
25|$|For Carlo Carafa, {{choosing}} the new pope <b>was</b> <b>literally</b> {{a matter of}} life and death and so he mainly used the conclave to obtain guarantees that he and his relatives would not be punished for their abuses. He had one serious advantage – the Italian cardinals nominated by his uncle Paul remained loyal to him. He favoured Carpi and Gonzaga for pope. Although his uncle was an enemy of the Spanish, and encouraged France, Carlo decided to ally himself with the Spanish party.|$|E
25|$|This last {{sculpture}} {{ended up}} in Réunion only due to the intervention of a leading political figure, Lucien Gasparin, who <b>was</b> <b>literally</b> “the incarnation of Réunion in the National Assembly from 1906 to 1942”: it was this deputy, born in 1868, who signed the public order {{at a cost of}} thirty million francs on 11 July 1931. Soon after, in the little village centre of Salazie, a commune on the Heights of the island situated in the eponymous cirque, the statue was placed in front of the town hall.|$|E

25|$|Peter grew to be {{extremely}} tall as an adult, especially for the time period. Standing at 6ft 8in (203cm) in height, the Russian tsar <b>was</b> <b>literally</b> {{head and shoulders above}} his contemporaries both in Russia and throughout Europe. Peter, however, lacked the overall proportional heft and bulk generally found in a man that size. Both his hands and feet were small, and his shoulders were narrow for his height; likewise, his head was small for his tall body. Added to this were Peter's noticeable facial tics, and he may have suffered from petit mal, a form of epilepsy.|$|E
25|$|On 18 June 1855, the besieging British and French armies began {{what was}} {{intended}} to be the final assault that would take Sevastopol, which began with a huge bombardment. As a sapper, Gordon was in a front line trench where he was under intense fire, men fell all around him and he was forced to take cover so often that he <b>was</b> <b>literally</b> covered from head to toe with mud, blood and gore. Despite the best efforts of the Allies, the French failed to take the Malakhov fortress while the British failed to take the Redan fortress on 18 June. The casualties on the Allied side were quite high that day.|$|E
25|$|On {{a trip to}} New York City, Rogers was at Madison Square Garden when a wild steer {{broke out}} of the arena and began to climb into the viewing stands. Rogers roped the steer {{to the delight of}} the crowd. The feat got front page {{attention}} from the newspapers, giving him valuable publicity and an audience eager to see more. Willie Hammerstein saw his vaudeville act, and signed Rogers to appear on the Victoria Roof—which <b>was</b> <b>literally</b> on a rooftop—with his pony. For the next decade, Rogers estimated he worked for fifty weeks a year at the Roof and at the city's myriad vaudeville theaters.|$|E
