5|$|Parseghian's {{teams at}} Miami {{consistently}} {{did well in}} the Mid-American Conference, posting a 7–3 record in 1951 and improving to 8–1 the following year.

Coast Air introduced state-subsidized services in 1990, and continued until the contract was won by Teddy Air in 1996. From 2000 the airport was served by Guard Air, but following their bankruptcy in 2001, services were taken over by Widerøe for six months, when Arctic Air won a one-year contract. Coast Air resumed the service from 2003 to 2008, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>went</b> bankrupt. Air Norway then operated services for one year, pending DOT LT's take over in 2009.|$|E
