5000|$|From Jilava, {{they were}} {{transferred}} to the Cavnic mine labor camp, in northwest Romania, close to another, older, labor camp at Baia Sprie. Before the second world war, the Cavnic mine belonged to a Romanian-Belgian company, that closed down the facility because of low profitability. Now, the Baia Sprie Mining Plant decided to reopen it. They provided the technical and logistic guidance, while the Ministry of Internal Affairs provided the labor force, consisting of political detainees. Aside the Jilava lot, also a group of older prisoners, from the Baia Sprie camp, was assigned to start work at this new mining facility. There were also civilian miners working there. The civilian work force was concentrated at the -100 meter <b>work</b> <b>front,</b> while the labor camp force, completely isolated from the first, were concentrated at the -200 meter work front.At first, {{as part of the}} overall experiment, they were housed in brand-new huts and even overfed. They were told by the administration that the civilized behaviour towards them, detention comfort and food amount are depending on the level of the performed work quota. Coming from prisons all over the country where personal space was very restricted, while cold and famine were regular, the inmates started working hard and raising the workload on a daily basis. In time, the food quality and quantity worsened, and so did the administration's behavior towards them. They were not able to meet the high workload anymore, and this also led to conflicts with newly arrived inmates, who were accusing the old ones of Stakhanovism.Ioanid gives a detailed description of work techniques and equipment during the daily shift. However, there was always a competition between the camp administration and the prisoners. The first wanted high work output, while the latter wanted to work as little as possible, to avoid injuries and prevent overwork-related health issues. The inmates used any possible means to sabotage the work effort: intentionally damaging the equipment, reporting false - bigger - quotas or not reporting rich ore veins when discovered so that they could be slowly exploited. Working underground was difficult, depending on the exploited vein, temperatures and humidity could be very high, or freezing cold water could pour from the ceiling. Accidents were frequent and many died or were maimed. Mining related diseases were also common. Those who opposed the administration were punished with cruelty: ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{contribute}} {{to the understanding of the}} current vulnerability to variability in rainfall of small farmers in the State of Ceará in Northeast Brazil by identifying factors that affect a household’s vulnerability and its ability to prepare for, or respond to, droughts. Understanding these factors can help to identify the households most in need of assistance during a drought and provide a target for programs that build capacity to adapt. Assistance programs currently use criteria to identify eligible programs. This analysis could also help inform an assessment of whether those criteria are appropriate for assisting the most vulnerable families. While, overall, we would expect that vulnerability would be tied to poverty, for this study, I make the assumption that within comparable levels of poverty, there are factors that may increase the resilience of some households to drought. Hence, although all households surveyed for this study would be considered poor, I assume that specific factors—such as land ownership, irrigation or pension income—may make a family more resilient to drought. Both qualitative and quantitative data and methods are used in this analysis. The qualitative section describes the information acquired in interviews with Brazilian experts. These responses were used to inform the selection of variables in the quantitative portion of the analysis. The quantitative piece uses data from a survey of small farmers in two areas of Ceará. Participation in a <b>work</b> <b>front,</b> a state-run temporary employment program available only during droughts, is used as a proxy for vulnerability to drought since historically work fronts have been used only as a last resort strategy when families have lost all other alternatives of income. A probit analysis is used to identify economic and demographic variables that are linked with increased probability of participation in the <b>work</b> <b>front.</b> A factor analysis is then used to identify components that explain a significant portion of the variance in the data set and to group households into similar groups. These results are then compared with the outcome of <b>work</b> <b>front</b> participation. Overall, the combination of probit and factor analyses proved successful in identifying households that were likely to have joined the <b>work</b> <b>front</b> in the past. The similarity of results from the probit and factor analysis supported the results. Additionally, variables identified as important determinants of vulnerability to droughts in interviews and the literature proved to be significant statistically. These key variables include on-farm production, non-farm income, particularly pensions, irrigation and plot size...|$|E

In a quasi-experimental design methodology, the used technique was the observation from the capture of images in the classes. An element we paid particular attention in the analysis of the classes was the implementation of strategies that involve practical activities, since the didactic research has amply demonstrated that they are likely to generate active learning in science education, with particular emphasis in chemistry. The results revealed that the expert teachers often use practical activities in their classrooms, using group work procedures, <b>work</b> <b>front</b> and questions oral and written...|$|E
40|$|Summary. The {{analysis}} covered 50 applications filed to The Agency for Restructuring and Modernisation of Agriculture {{within the}} operation concerning modernisation of farms. For 96 % of applicants, {{the purpose of}} operation was to improve the production safety including improvement of work safety. Therefore, purchase of tractors was a prevailing objective of modernisation investments. In the researched farms, an average growth of tractors equipment of 0. 7 item is planned at the already existing equipment of 1. 5 item. In reference to arable land area the equipment rate will raise from 6. 0 item· 100 ha- 1 AL to 8. 8 item· 100 ha- 1 AL. At such low livestock and high share of grains in the sowing structure of average farms, such {{a high level of}} investment cannot be fully justified. Especially because the investments con-cern tractors of a higher class of towing power for which the <b>work</b> <b>front</b> is limited. Key words: farm, tractor, modernization, investment...|$|E
40|$|Italy has {{the lowest}} birth rates in Europe; on the <b>work</b> <b>front,</b> most women stop working when they become mothers while a {{minority}} work full time, with huge reconciliation problems. The male breadwinner family model {{has long been the}} dominant factor and the hegemonic cultural model in Italy; this has defined family members’ relationships with the employment system, the environment considered suitable for bringing up children, and the division of work within the family. Data on the allocation of time and differences in the time devoted by men and women to unpaid care and domestic work show the persistence of a gendered, unbalanced distribution of unpaid work in Italy even among younger cohorts. In this context what is the role and influence of leave legislation? The aim of this presentation is to briefly illustrate the path made in recent years by Italian leave policies and changes noticed since April 2014 (Jobs Act) in particular with Legislative Decree 15 June 2015, n. 80 “ Measures for the reconciliation of the demands of care, life and work”...|$|E

40|$|Neck pain is {{a common}} {{musculoskeletal}} complaint and a relationship with reduced work-related functional capacity is assumed. A validated instrument to test functional capacity of patients with neck pain is unavailable. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE), which is content valid for determining functional capacity in patients with work related neck disorders (WRND). A review of epidemiological review literature was conducted to identify physical risk factors for WRND. Evidence was found that physical risk factors contribute in development of WRND. Physical risk factors were related to repetitive movements, forceful movements, awkward positions and static contractions of the neck or the neck/shoulder region. An FCE was designed based on the risk factors identified. Eight tests were selected to cover all risk factors: repetitive side reaching, repetitive reaching overhead, static overhead <b>work,</b> <b>front</b> carry, forward static bend neck, overhead lift and the neck strength test. Content validity of this FCE was established by providing the rationale, specific objectives and operational definitions of the FCE.

40|$|Excerpt] In September 1963, Leave It To Beaver aired for {{the last}} time. Yet, the {{archetype}} of family life that this show idealized—the employed father and stay-at-home mother within the nuclear family—was so engrained in the collective unconscious that American Women: The Report of the President’s Commission on the Status of Women (hereafter American Women), delivered to President Kennedy in 1963, made almost no mention of it. It was just assumed that this was normal. Fifty years later perhaps the most profound change in American society is the change in family structures. In 1963, roughly two thirds of U. S. households were like the Cleavers in Leave It to Beaver. Today, married couples with children represent only about 20 % of U. S. households. The other 80 % of households reflect a myriad of families—from single parents to same sex couples to dual-income couples, {{some of whom are}} married and some of whom are not.
