60|$|We had now {{reached a}} narrow passage, which showed almost the {{appearance}} of having been cut by human strength and artifice in the solid rock. There was a wall of granite on each side, high and precipitous, especially on our right, and so smooth that a few evergreens could hardly find foothold enough to grow there. This is the entrance, or, in the direction we were going, the extremity, of the romantic defile of the Notch. Before emerging from it, the rattling of wheels approached behind us, and a stage-coach rumbled out of the mountain, with seats on top and trunks behind, and a smart driver, in a drab greatcoat, touching the wheel horses with the <b>whipstock</b> and reining in the leaders. To my mind there {{was a sort of}} poetry in such an incident, hardly inferior to what would have accompanied the painted array of an Indian war party gliding forth from the same wild chasm. All the passengers, except a very fat lady on the back seat, had alighted. One was a mineralogist, a scientific, green-spectacled figure in black, bearing a heavy hammer, with which he did great damage to the precipices, and put the fragments in his pocket. Another was a well-dressed young man, who carried an opera glass set in gold, and seemed to be making a quotation from some of Byron's rhapsodies on mountain scenery. There was also a trader, returning from Portland to the upper part of Vermont; and a fair young girl, with a very faint bloom like one of those pale and delicate flowers which sometimes occur among alpine cliffs.|$|E

40|$|Rotary {{steerable}} {{drilling tool}} systems (RSS) {{are ideal for}} tool integrating downhole automation control and drilling technology, which are used for drilling directional and complex track wells. A simply supported beam model is generally used to research bit side force for point-the-bit RSS tools. The greatest advantage is simplification {{in the analysis of}} the bit side force. However, for the side force solution on a point to the bit conditions, the existing literature ignore that this drilling tool system has an outward extended distance. Otherwise the bit in contact with the well wall will form a new support. According to the situation, a point to the bit tool has an outward extended distance; if we ignore this extended distance, and simplify it or just take it as the reaction force of the tool lower bearing support, or side force of the bit a great inaccuracy error will result. Because the beam has an outward extended distance related to the real bit side force, we need more research in this area. Using to the principle of minimum complementary energy, we can explore the mechanical properties of rotary steerable tools. The rotary steerable tool mandrel force model is based on the mandrel and the rotary steering drilling tool which has three supports; upper and lower bearing and continuous beam model bit. The coordinate system is built in accordance with axial line of orienting rotary steerable drilling tool. The conclusions from the theory analysis and project example calculation in this paper indicate: RSS technology is a powerful tool for oil exploration and development. It effectively solves technical difficulties in oil and gas exploration and development. Particularly, with regard to higher productivity and fewer drilling risks and downhole accidents with more exposed reservoirs, it delivers excellent performance. A basic theoretical study of a rotary steering tool system helps us further master the mechanical characteristics of the tool system from the angle of mechanical behavior and features of the tool. In combination with different <b>whipstocking</b> operation principles, we have established different mechanical models to solve the mechanical property parameters, then we can assess the mechanical properties of the RSS...|$|R

5000|$|Combined, these survey {{tools and}} BHA designs made {{directional}} drilling possible, {{but it was}} perceived as arcane. The next major advance was in the 1970s, when downhole drilling motors (aka mud motors, driven by the hydraulic power of drilling mud circulated down the drill string) became common. These allowed the drill bit to continue rotating at the cutting face {{at the bottom of}} the hole, while most of the drill pipe was held stationary. A piece of bent pipe (a [...] "bent sub") between the stationary drill pipe and the top of the motor allowed the direction of the wellbore to be changed without needing to pull all the drill pipe out and place another <b>whipstock.</b> Coupled with the development of measurement while drilling tools (using mud pulse telemetry, networked or wired pipe or EM telemetry, which allows tools down hole to send directional data back to the surface without disturbing drilling operations), directional drilling became easier.|$|E

He helped revolutionize the {{mining and petroleum}} industry and is recognized as {{the driving force behind}} the introduction of diamond drill bits into the petroleum exploration industry. Originally, the company manufactured diamond drill bits for the western mining industry, but the founders quickly envisioned a strong market in petroleum. By 1946, Christensen diamond bits were introduced into the Rangley field of Colorado. The bits were so successful the company decided to make petroleum drilling its primary market. His company, Christensen Diamond Products Company, became the world’s largest producer of industrial diamond products.http://www.bakerhughes.com/hcc/about/history.htmBy the 1960s, the company was expanding into international markets. Christensen also developed an erosion-resistant matrix for diamond bits and introduced the 250P-core barrel system that quickly became the industry standard. In the 1970s, downhole tools and motors formed the basis for a broader drilling package that included the Navi-Drill downhole motor. Later in the decade, Christensen Diamond Products introduced the synthetic polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit.In 1978, Christensen Diamond Products was acquired by Norton Co. of Worcester, Mass. The company’s name was changed to Norton Christensen in 1983. Norton Christensen merged with Eastman <b>Whipstock,</b> the world’s largest directional drilling company, in 1986 to form Eastman Christensen. Baker International acquired Hughes Tool Company in 1987, merging to become Baker Hughes Incorporated. Baker Hughes then went on to acquire Eastman Christensen three years later in. In 1992, Baker Hughes merged the two divisions—Eastman Christensen and Hughes Tool Company—to form Hughes Christensen.|$|E

40|$|Directional Drilling (DD) {{technology}} {{can be used in}} deep glacier boreholes to obtain additional ice cores from any depth and create supplemental boreholes for geophysical research on glacier ice properties under natural conditions. Experimental directional drilling was done using an antifreeze thermal electrical drill (ATED) in a PICO test well. A special device called a <b>whipstock</b> was used for the deflection of the ATED in previously-drilled borehole. The test demonstrated that a <b>whipstock</b> deployed in the main borehole permits directional drilling to obtain extra ice core. The experimental <b>whipstock</b> was placed 25 cm above the bottom of the 4. 5 m deep borehole. The ATED was inclined in previously-prepared cavity to an angle of up to 3 °. When the second borehole reached a depth of about 6 m from the <b>whipstock</b> it had no inclination. The distance between axes of the main and secondary boreholes was about 0. 3 m.

30|$|The Sasso- 22 {{exploration}} drilling {{well in the}} Larderello field was completed in 1980 at a final depth of 4094  m with a total loss of circulation from a depth of 608  m onwards, mainly due to numerous large and unsealable fractures and cavities. The rock formations drilled were extremely hard and nonhomogenous making drilling significantly difficult. A lack of drilling fluid returns forced the drilling team to use water with viscous plugs and implementing a less stiff drill string without stabilizers to prevent drill bit blocking during drilling operations. This phenomenon resulted in significant difficulties in keeping the well straight. The main problems occurred below 3000  m due to breakage of the steel drill pipes, possibly related to high temperatures and the highly corrosive nature of reservoir fluids. The primary cementing operation of the 9 5 / 8 ″ production casing could not be achieved with a stinger string {{and had to be}} performed through casing perforations using squeezing techniques. Due to extremely high well temperatures reaching approximately 380  °C at depth of 3970  m, measured using wire-line logging, explosives or hydraulic fishing 6 tools such as jars could not be used. Pumping cold water into the well proved to be efficient and helped to free the drill string. Side-tracking with cement plugs was attempted to continue drilling; however, cement could not be placed {{at the bottom of the}} well for centering the <b>whipstock</b> equipment. The main reason for mentioned failures can be explained by the extremely high and uncontrollable reservoir temperatures. After three side-track attempts, the 9 5 / 8 ″ production casing was in very poor condition and decision was made to abandon the well soon after drilling operations ceased (Bertini 1980). Further analysis has shown that stress corrosion of casing material was aggravated with the steam condensates from a geothermal plant as a drilling fluid (Baron and Ungemach 1980).|$|E
40|$|The {{integrated}} processing {{and interpretation of}} VSP data are developed {{to work together in}} order to enhance the final VSP interpretation. Furthermore, the interpretive processing of the VSP data within the case histories are reviewed along with the incorporation of the final VSP results (both near and far offset data) into the integrated geological/geophysical interpretations presented in the case studies. This thesis has attempted to personify the term "interpreter/processor" as first highlighted in Hardage (1985). The case histories pertain to oil and gas exploration in carbonate reef and sandstones in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). The Lanaway case history (Hinds et al., 1994 a) pertains to the exploration of the Lanaway/Garrington oil field located in central Alberta, Canada. The surface seismic interpretation over the reef crest differed dramatically from the isopach of the reef-encasing shales derived from the geological logs of a borehole drilled into the reef crest. To understand the discrepancy, a VSP survey was performed and the data were interpretatively processed. The results were integrated with the known geology of the field area to uncover possible reasons for the surface seismic anomaly. field in central Alberta, Canada, using the far offset VSP survey. Existing surface seismic was used to infer that a well drilled into the interpreted North-east corner of the Ricinus reef would be successful in penetrating oil bearing carbonate reef. The well was drilled; however, the well missed the reef and a near and far offset VSP survey was used to seismically image possible reef buildups in an area around the well. The Fort St. John Graben case history (Hinds et al., 1991 a; Hinds et al., 1993 a) highlights exploration of a gas-filled channel sandstone using near and far offset (lateral) VSP surveys. An exploration well was drilled within the study area which intersected the target zone sandstone (the basal Kiskatinaw of the Upper Carboniferous). The target sandstone had a high shale content and was not reservoir quality. A near offset and two far offset VSP surveys were run in the exploration well to image out to a distance of 350 m to the North¬west and to the East of the well. The VSP, surface seismic and geology results (from the geological logs of the exploration and surrounding wells) are integrated to infer a clearer picture of the sand/shale relationships of the basal Kiskatinaw and detailed faulting of• the Carboniferous strata around the well and within the surface seismic line area. The Simonette field case history (Hinds et al., 1991 b; Hinds et al., 1993 b) involves using VSP results to image the slope of a low-relief carbonate reef. The low-relief reef examined using the VSP data is located at the extreme end of a North-east reef spur of the Simonette Reef located in North-west Alberta, Canada. An exploration well drilled in the low-relief reef penetrated the edge of the reef. The VSP surveys were run in order to infer details of the reef slope. The interpretation of the VSP data was integrated with all other exploration data to infer the location of the crest of the low-relief reef and to assist in determining whether to <b>whipstock</b> the exploration well or not.
