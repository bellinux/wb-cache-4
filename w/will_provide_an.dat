25|$|Autumn nears, and Tyler hears {{that the}} caribou are {{migrating}} south, which <b>will</b> <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> opportunity {{for him to}} study the concept his superiors want to confirm. Ootek takes Tyler on a two-day hike to where the caribou will be. The caribou show up as predicted and Tyler observes the wolves make several unsuccessful attacks. Tyler helps drive caribou towards the pack, which soon takes one down. Tyler takes a bone and samples the marrow, discovering the dead caribou to be diseased. It confirms that the wolves are not ruthless killers but rather their predation kills off only the weaker caribou.|$|E
25|$|Activation of the {{hedgehog}} pathway {{has been}} implicated {{in the development of}} cancers in various organs, including brain, lung, mammary gland, prostate and skin. Basal cell carcinoma, {{the most common form of}} cancerous malignancy, has the closest association with hedgehog signaling. Loss-of-function mutations in Patched and activating mutations in Smoothened have been identified in patients with this disease. Abnormal activation of the pathway probably leads to development of disease through transformation of adult stem cells into cancer stem cells that give rise to the tumor. Cancer researchers hope that specific inhibitors of hedgehog signaling <b>will</b> <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> efficient therapy for a wide range of malignancies.|$|E

The evidence from the site indicates that possible influences from Mesoamerica, e.g. the ball game, are in evidence in Puerto Rico as early as 700 A.D. The presence of shell middens and refuse heaps at the site will afford an opportunity to study subsistence patterns as well as possibly some information on the paleoenvironment. The burials and associated grave goods <b>will</b> <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> insight into social, religious, ceremonial/symbolic systems of these occupants, as well as provide information on prehistoric demographic patterns, nutrition, disease and other prehistoric population characteristics.|$|E

25|$|The {{purpose of}} the Relief Line is to help reduce current and {{projected}} congestion in downtown Toronto. In 2012, it was becoming apparent to the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) and Metrolinx that even with proposed improvements, the Yonge line and Bloor–Yonge station was facing significant capacity constraints. , the Yonge line operates 11% over its capacity south of Line 2 during the morning rush hour. The new Toronto Rocket trains operating on the line, and the future implementation of Automatic Train Control will help increase {{the capacity of the}} Yonge line. Other factors are expected to reduce demand such as the extension of the University–Spadina portion of Line 1 into Vaughan, and other local transit improvements. However, after factoring in population and employment growth and the proposed extension of the Yonge line into Richmond Hill, the Yonge line is projected to be at 96% of its capacity by 2031. The Relief Line <b>will</b> <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> alternate route for commuters heading downtown by allowing them to bypass the congested Yonge line and avoid transferring at Bloor–Yonge Station.|$|E

500|$|According to Wellek and Warren, {{evaluation}} of literary {{work should be}} done based on the work's own nature, divorced from an author's practical or scientific intent. They reject evaluation based on extra-literary content, writing instead that literature– like all fine art– <b>will</b> <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> [...] "aesthetic experience" [...] which can be judged. They note various criteria used to identify [...] "good" [...] literature, rejecting Russian formalism's criterion of defamiliarization and similar understandings for one based on the diversity of materials amalgamated within a work. They reject a static hierarchy or generationalist understanding of literary greats. Instead, they suggest that every work's rank changes when a new work is introduced and that values within are [...] "really, or potentially, present in the art object". They note a dialectic relationship between evaluating and critically analyzing literature. This ties genre theory {{to the history of}} literature.|$|E
