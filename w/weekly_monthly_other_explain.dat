Whenever a certain product is advertised during the show, Don Francisco, along with the audience, would sing that product's jingle. Otherwise, he will describe the product. Most products, such as Cookie Crisp and Chex cereals (when they were produced by Ralston), would often alternate <b>weekly</b> or <b>monthly.</b> <b>Other</b> products advertised on Sabado Gigante have included AC Delco, Allstate, American Airlines (for the show's travel segment [...] "La Camara Viajera"), AutoZone, Cap'n Crunch, Coca-Cola, Colgate, Dog Chow (alternates with its Puppy Chow counterpart), Domino's Pizza, Ferrero Rocher, M&M's (alternates with its sister brands Snickers, Skittles and Starburst), Mazola, McDonald's, Miller (for the musical segments), Oreo (alternates with its sister brands Chips Ahoy!, Ritz, Nilla and Premium Saltines), Pampers, Payless ShoeSource, Pepto-Bismol, Polaroid (for the car games), Quaker Instant Oatmeal (most often for El Chacal de La Trompeta; alternates with Aunt Jemima), Secret Deodorant and Sprint.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A flow-duration curve (FDC) {{is simply}} the {{complement}} of the cu-mulative distribution function of daily, <b>weekly,</b> <b>monthly</b> (or some <b>other</b> time interval of) streamflow. Applications of FDCs include, but are not limmited to, hydropower planning, water-quality management, river and reservoir sedimentation studies, habitat suitability, and low-flow augmentation. Although FDCs have a long and rich history {{in the field of}} hydrology, they are sometimes criticized because, tra-ditionally, their interpretation depends on the particular period of record on which they are based. If one considers n individual FDCs, each corresponding to one of the individual n years of record, then one may treat those n annual FDCs {{in much the same way}} one treats a sequence of annual maximum or annual minimum streamflows. This new annual-based interpretation enables confidence intervals and recurrence intervals to be associated with FDCs in a nonparametric framework...|$|R
40|$|Certain {{pathogenic}} Escherichia coli {{known as}} Shiga toxin (Stx) -producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are commensals in cattle, and typically cause bloody diarrhea in humans once the Stx toxin is secreted in invaded intestinal epithelial cells. Infections with STEC cells {{can lead to}} hemolytic uremic syndrome, which is commonly associated with kidney failure. Several STEC serogroups have been declared adulterants in raw, non-intact ground meat, and future regulations could potentially lead to a higher number of STEC serogroup detection strategies for these pathogenic microorganisms. Microbiological research laboratories may benefit from formalin-fixed STEC cells for periodic (daily, <b>weekly,</b> <b>monthly,</b> among <b>others)</b> instrument validation/calibration by serving as a working set of known cell concentration samples and internal standard i. e. positive control. These cell concentrations may be used across laboratories in different geographical locations, within an individual laboratory, and across {{a broad range of}} detection assays (molecular as well as immuno-based). This thesis consists of three research parts: a comprehensive literature review that covers STEC incidence in foods and molecular detection techniques (chapter 1), a literature review that covers immuno-based detection strategies (chapter 2), and a research manuscript that involves the development of an internal standard and positive control with formalin-fixed STEC cells {{that can be used for}} a broad range of molecular as well immuno-based detection assays for instrument calibration and validation purposes (chapter 3) ...|$|R

50|$|The load phase loads {{the data}} {{into the end}} target, which may be a simple delimited flat file or a data warehouse. Depending on the {{requirements}} of the organization, this process varies widely. Some data warehouses may overwrite existing information with cumulative information; updating extracted data is frequently done on a daily, <b>weekly,</b> or <b>monthly</b> basis. <b>Other</b> data warehouses (or even other parts of the same data warehouse) may add new data in a historical form at regular intervals—for example, hourly. To understand this, consider a data warehouse that is required to maintain sales records of the last year. This data warehouse overwrites any data older than a year with newer data. However, the entry of data for any one year window is made in a historical manner. The timing and scope to replace or append are strategic design choices dependent on the time available and the business needs. More complex systems can maintain a history and audit trail of all changes to the data loaded in the data warehouse.|$|R
