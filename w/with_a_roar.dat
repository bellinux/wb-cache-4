Within half an hour, the lead roof was melting, and the books and papers in the crypt caught <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>roar.</b> [...] "The stones of Paul's flew like grenados," [...] reported Evelyn in his diary, [...] "the melting lead running down the streets in a stream, and the very pavements glowing with fiery redness, so as no horse, nor man, was able to tread on them." [...] The cathedral was quickly a ruin.|$|E
500|$|When {{the film}} reels {{were taken to}} Madras, {{thousands}} of people gathered at the city's central railway station and followed the reel box along Wall Tax Road to Kinema Central, throwing rose petals, breaking open coconuts, and burning incense. The posters of the film read, Tamil Telugu pesi paadu padam (...) [...] An earlier attempt at producing a Tamil sound film, a four-reel short (identified by S. Theodore Baskaran as Korathi Dance and Songs), was screened alongside Kalidas as a side attraction. It starred Rajalakshmi, and the gypsy dancer Jhansi Bai. In a 2015 interview with The Times of India, Rajalakshmi's daughter Kamala stated that during the film's release, [...] "people in Madras used to stand outside theatres for {{a distance of about}} 4-5km to witness [...] acting in her first pesum padam. She was welcomed <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>roar</b> here. Her name was announced from speakers installed on roads and autorickshaws, as a talkie was something new for the people." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{reassembled}} delegates {{had heard}} rumors that Harding was {{the choice of}} a cabal of senators. Although this was not true, delegates believed it, and sought a way out by voting for Harding. When balloting resumed on the morning of June 12, Harding gained votes on each of the next four ballots, rising to 133 as the two frontrunners saw little change. Lodge then declared a three-hour recess, to the outrage of Daugherty, who raced to the podium and confronted him, [...] "You cannot defeat this man this way! The motion was not carried! You cannot defeat this man!" [...] Lodge and others used the break to try to stop the Harding momentum and make RNC Chairman Hays the nominee, a scheme Hays refused {{to have anything to do}} with. The ninth ballot, after some initial suspense, saw delegation after delegation break for Harding, who took the lead with 374 votes to 249 for Wood and 121 for Lowden (Johnson had 83). Lowden released his delegates to Harding, and the tenth ballot, held at 6p.m., was a mere formality, with Harding finishing with 672 votes to 156 for Wood. The nomination was made unanimous. The delegates, desperate to leave town before they incurred more hotel expenses, then proceeded to the vice presidential nomination. Harding wanted Senator Irvine Lenroot of Wisconsin, who was unwilling to run, but before Lenroot's name could be withdrawn and another man decided on, an Oregon delegate proposed Governor Coolidge, which was met <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>roar</b> of approval from the delegates. Coolidge, popular for his role in breaking the Boston police strike of 1919, was nominated for vice president, receiving two and a fraction votes more than Harding had. James Morgan wrote in The Boston Globe: [...] "The delegates would not listen to remaining in Chicago over Sunday... the President makers did not have a clean shirt. On such things, Rollo, turns the destiny of nations." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 1st Division (Brigade) Arkansas State Troops, {{along with}} Brigadier-General Ben McCulloch’s Confederate brigade, marched north into Missouri, where they linked up with Major General Sterling Price’s Missouri State Guard. The {{combined}} force then moved towards Springfield, Missouri. [...] Under {{the command of}} fought at the Battle of Wilson's Creek, Missouri, on August 10, 1861. On the morning of August 10, 1861, while encamped along Wilson’s Creek, just south of Springfield, Missouri, the Southern army was attacked by a Union force under Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon. The ensuing battle {{was one of the}} largest and most desperately fought engagements in the western theater. Colonel John R. Gratiot's, 3rd Regiment, Arkansas State Troops had been held in reserve during the early part of the battle; however, a renewed Union assault on the Confederate right flank prompted calls for its immediate deployment. Forming in a long battle line, Gratiot’s regiment charged up Oak Hill toward the Union lines. [...] The regiment had reached a point about 40 yards from the enemy when the Federals unleashed a massive volley directly into the charging Arkansans. The regiment wavered momentarily, as scores of men fell dead or wounded, then charged forward <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>roar</b> and smashed into the Federals. After a vicious, face-to-face fight, using bayonets and clubbed muskets, the Southerners broke the Federal line. The unit suffered 109 casualties, including twenty-five killed, out of a force of 500 men.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the fire}} of October 9, 1848, only the four {{exterior}} walls remained standing. [...] The Icarian leader Cabet {{was fascinated by the}} temple and planned to reconstruct it, and a considerable amount of money was spent in the endeavor. [...] However, On May 27, 1850, Nauvoo was struck by a major tornado which toppled one of the walls of the temple. [...] One source claimed the storm seemed to [...] "single out the Temple", felling [...] "the walls <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>roar</b> that was heard miles away". [...] Cabet ordered the demolition of two more walls in the interests of public safety, leaving only the façade standing. The Icarians used much of the temple's stone to build a new school building on the southwest corner of the temple lot. By 1857, however, most of Cabet's followers had left Nauvoo and over time many of the original stones for the temple were used in the construction of other buildings throughout Hancock County. In February 1865 Nauvoo's City Council ordered the final demolition of the last standing portion of the templeone lone corner of the façade. Soon afterwards, all evidence of the temple disappeared, except for a hand pump over a well that supplied water to the baptismal font. [...] Three of the original sunstones are known to have survived and are on display [...] one is on loan to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' Visitor Center in Nauvoo, [...] one is in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C, and the third and only one that has not been restored is displayed, along with the only moonstone on display, at the Joseph Smith Historic Center of the Community of Christ.|$|E
