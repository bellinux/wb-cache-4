40|$|The study maps the political, economic, and {{cultural}} relations between France and the Central Eastern European countries {{ten years after}} the EU’s 2004 eastern enlargement. It shows that, although France has not officially or explicitly elevated the region to the status of a foreign policy priority, there is a real French presence in the region. As a general rule, France has been prioritizing the development of relations with the biggest Central Eastern European countries (and markets) and with the most francophone ones. The paper illustrates this by analyzing France’s recent investment in its bilateral relationship with Poland. This relationship has witnessed significant developments—first and foremost in the field of defense and security—and bears great potential.

The analysis focuses on the unprecedented mission of the <b>Weimar</b> <b>Triangle</b> foreign ministers to Ukraine in February 2014, which led to an agreement between the Ukrainian opposition and President Viktor Yanukovych.

Approved for public release; distribution is unlimitedPoland {{is arguably the}} leading example of successful democratization and Westernization within Central and Eastern Europe. This thesis explores how Poland’s participation in Western security structures has enabled it to reintegrate into Europe, emerging {{as one of the}} most politically influential and economically successful democratic nations from the former communist bloc. The steps and milestones of Poland’s accession to membership in NATO and the European Union, along with Poland’s participation in the <b>Weimar</b> <b>Triangle,</b> provide insight into Poland’s military, economic, and political transformations since 1991. This thesis analyzes Poland’s dramatic increase in participation in these Western security institutions and identifies where Poland has taken on a leadership role. In addition, this thesis explores to what extent Poland is likely to deepen its integration in each institution in the foreseeable future. This thesis concludes that one reason for Poland’s successful integration into the West is the country’s pursuit of membership in Western security institutions. Enrollment in these organizations required Poland to accomplish a drastic domestic overhaul affecting all sectors and levels of government. The result is that Poland now stands as a stable democratic nation in a region where such an outcome was not inevitable. Outstanding ThesisMajor, United States Air Forc...|$|E
40|$|The {{contracting}} defence budgets in Europe, {{the difficulties}} in developing the EU’s security policy, NATO's transformation, the reorientation of US security policy and the problems experienced by European defence industries – all together have in recent years created an increased interest in political, military and military-technological co-operation in Europe. It has manifested itself in concepts of closer co-operation within NATO and the EU (smart defence and pooling&sharing), bilateral and multilateral initiatives outside the structures of NATO and the EU (such as the Nordic Defence Co-operation or the Franco-British co-operation) and debates about the prerequisites, principles and objectives of bilateral, multilateral and regional security and defence co-operation. The present report aims to analyse the potential for security and defence co-operation among selected countries in the area between the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea, i. e. the Nordic states (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden), the Baltic states (Lithuania Latvia and Estonia), Poland's partners in the Visegrad Group (the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia) as well as Romania and Bulgaria. The authors were guided by the assumption that those states are Poland's natural partners for closer regional military co-operation. It may complement ‘the Western’ direction of Poland's security and defence policy, i. e. relations with the partners from the <b>Weimar</b> <b>Triangle</b> and the US.
