5|$|In the video, Candy {{is shown}} {{living with a}} cult on a farm {{populated}} by abused women and a tyrannical man. Candy and the other women are seen performing various chores around the house. The man demands that the women prepare dinner, and drags one of them outside by her hair. These opening sequences are accompanied by {{the sounds of a}} piano, the women's cooking knives, and the man's ax. The women seek vengeance against the man, removing all of their clothing, confronting him while he is chopping wood, and shooting him with golden rifles. Following the man's death, the women have dinner together <b>while</b> <b>wearing</b> latex clothing. The visual also includes scenes of Candy posing with a white horse <b>while</b> <b>wearing</b> oversized hats and holding decorated machine guns. During these scenes, Candy is shown only wearing a bodystocking, and in some instances a large chastity belt. To accommodate restrictions regarding censorship, Candy's nipples are airbrushed out of the shots.|$|E

Montgomery, who also iconically tattoed his chest with a maple-leaf, explained his visual promotion of the turtle, {{saying that he had}} assisted one to cross the road.

5|$|Condor bones {{have been}} found in Native American graves, as have condor feather headdresses. Cave {{paintings}} of condors have also been discovered. Some tribes ritually killed condors to make ceremonial clothing out of their feathers. Shamans then danced <b>while</b> <b>wearing</b> these to reach the upper and lower spiritual worlds. Whenever a shaman died, his clothes were said to be cursed, so new clothing had to be made for his successor. Some scientists, such as Noel Snyder, believe that this process of making ceremonial clothing contributed to the condor's decline.|$|E
5|$|Each {{district}} has fashion trends that affect gameplay. By wearing pins or clothing {{from the more}} popular brands in that district, items' effects will be improved; wearing the least fashionable items will do the opposite, and items from brands in between are not affected. However, the player can increase a brand's popularity in one district by repeatedly fighting battles in that district <b>while</b> <b>wearing</b> items of that brand. The player can enter shops to buy new pins, clothes, and food items that are gradually consumed during battles to improve the characters' basic attributes.|$|E

5|$|ILC did {{not produce}} apparel for adults until the {{introduction}} of the Living Girdle in 1940, after patenting a method of manufacturing latex girdles that would not tear at the seams if they had a small tear or hole. The Living Girdle was advertised with images of mobility and comfort, such as women playing tennis or leaping <b>while</b> <b>wearing</b> it, though the solid rubber girdle was actually very uncomfortable.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, in {{an effort}} to improve her in-ring skills, Stock {{relocated}} to Monterrey, Mexico to face the female wrestlers there. At the suggestion of a promoter, Stock began working <b>while</b> <b>wearing</b> a mask. She also took on the ring name Dark Angel, on the advice of Eddie Watts. She initially found it difficult to work with the wrestlers in Mexico, as she did not speak Spanish and could not communicate with them throughout the match. On October 17, she defeated Simply Luscious to win the Lucha Libre Femenil Juvenil Championship.|$|E

5|$|Support for {{the protests}} started to {{extend to the}} local {{community}} when Jean Gosling, a lollipop lady in Wanstead, upon learning of the tree's impending destruction, rallied the support of local children (and was later fired from her job for doing so <b>while</b> <b>wearing</b> her uniform), who in turn recruited their parents into the protests. It was then that the non-resident radicals realised that they had significant local support. When local residents gathered for a tree dressing ceremony on 6 November, they found their way barred by security fencing. With support from the protesters, they pulled it down.|$|E

5|$|The {{austerity}} and the passivity of {{the first}} character is, however, contrasted vividly with the passion and activity of the second character. Madonna in this portrayal wears a red voluminous extravagant Spanish style dress, which shows off her décolletage, with a middle parting in the skirt, <b>while</b> <b>wearing</b> red carnations in her hair. Complementing this passionate look, the second setting features a bright red room with red candles and candelabra.

5|$|The {{video is}} set at night and opens with Brown, {{dressed in a black}} suit, {{drinking}} alcohol in the streets, before hailing a futuristic hover-cab. Brown asks the cab driver {{to take him to the}} best spot in town. He then asks the driver to turn up the air conditioner because he's hot, but the driver turns up the music instead, <b>while</b> <b>wearing</b> a horse mask on his head. As the song begins, Brown exits the cab and arrives at a street party filled with people wearing animal heads. He then enters a club, where he performs the first dance sequence in the video with his male backup dancers. During the first chorus, Brown arrives inside the main room of the club filled with flashing lights and people dancing <b>while</b> <b>wearing</b> animal heads. After a hat gets tossed to him by one of his dancers in the crowd, Brown and his backup dancers perform another dance sequence as the queen of the party watches them from her perch. These party scenes are intercut with scenes of Brown dancing alone in another room surrounded by flashing lights and speakers in the background.|$|E
