5|$|A graph {{that has}} a topological {{ordering}} cannot have any cycles, because the edge into the earliest vertex of a cycle <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> oriented the wrong way. Therefore, every graph with a topological ordering is acyclic.|$|E
5|$|Although the Serbian Army {{had put up}} fierce {{resistance}} and inflicted heavy casualties on the Austro-Hungarians, Putnik became concerned that his lines were over-extended. He began contemplating another strategic withdrawal, one in which Belgrade <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> evacuated. On the night of 26–27 November, the Austro-Hungarian 6th Army attacked all along the front and pushed deeper into the Serbian interior.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{hotly contested}} status of O'Shaughnessy Dam in the {{environmental}} field, and occasional federal money set aside for studying alternatives to Hetch Hetchy – such as $7 million provided by President George W. Bush in 2007 in the National Park Service budget – local support for its removal is relatively low. In 2012, San Francisco voters struck down Proposition F, which would have ordered the city to study the removal of O'Shaughnessy Dam and draft a plan to replace Hetch Hetchy water, {{by a vote of}} 77 percent against. Proposition F would have allocated $8 million to create a feasibility study by 2016; new water delivery and filtration systems <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in place by 2025 and Hetch Hetchy Reservoir <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> drained by 2035.|$|E
5|$|Digidesign {{was working}} on {{expanding}} ProTools from a single track to multitracking and {{it was hoped that}} as many as 48 digital tracks could be synced and used to record.

5|$|For the {{remainder}} of her career, Connecticut sailed to various places in both the Atlantic and Pacific while training newer recruits to the Navy. However, {{the provisions of the}} 1922 Washington Naval Treaty stipulated that many of the older battleships, Connecticut among them, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> disposed of, so she was decommissioned on 1 March 1923 and sold for scrap on 1 November 1923.|$|E
25|$|According to Deutsche Bahn, {{the already}} built {{structures}} {{have already been}} included in the regular maintenance program in order to ensure their functionality {{at the opening of the}} line. Early operations on the section between Erfurt and Ilmenau and further modifications of the project were proposed. Deutsche Bahn rejected early operations on the line. On the one hand, such regional services had not been ordered by the State of Thuringia; on the other hand, the safety and control technology that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> installed <b>would</b> <b>have</b> become obsolete when the entire line was opened and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> replaced.

5|$|In Lillehammer's {{bids for}} the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics, Balbergbakken was the {{proposed}} site of ski jumping. Lillehammer {{was awarded the}} 1994 Olympics in 1988, but a year later the plans to use Balbergbanen were abandoned. The venue was regarded as unsuitable; for instance NOK30 million <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> spent on building a new access road. In addition, a new water and sewer system, new stands, participant facilities and a normal hill <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> built. The available space at Balbergbakken was limited, and the organizers saw it as advantageous to have the ski stadium close to the ski jumping hills.|$|E
5|$|In November 1942 the Military Policy Committee {{approved}} {{the construction of}} a 600-stage gaseous diffusion plant. On 14 December, M. W. Kellogg accepted an offer to construct the plant, which was codenamed K-25. A cost plus fixed-fee contract was negotiated, eventually totaling $2.5million. A separate corporate entity called Kellex was created for the project, headed by Percival C. Keith, one of Kellogg's vice presidents. The process faced formidable technical difficulties. The highly corrosive gas uranium hexafluoride <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used, as no substitute could be found, and the motors and pumps <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> vacuum tight and enclosed in inert gas. The biggest problem was the design of the barrier, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> strong, porous and resistant to corrosion by uranium hexafluoride. The best choice for this seemed to be nickel. Edward Adler and Edward Norris created a mesh barrier from electroplated nickel. A six-stage pilot plant was built at Columbia to test the process, but the Norris-Adler prototype proved to be too brittle. A rival barrier was developed from powdered nickel by Kellex, the Bell Telephone Laboratories and the Bakelite Corporation. In January 1944, Groves ordered the Kellex barrier into production.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the regency {{showed little}} respect for local customs. As a Roman Catholic, Otto himself {{was viewed as}} a heretic by many pious Greeks; however, his heirs <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Orthodox, {{according}} to the terms of the 1843 Constitution.|$|E
25|$|In November 2016, a {{referendum}} was held concerning a Green Party initiative that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> phased out all nuclear plants after a life-span of 45 years. The 3 oldest nuclear plants (Beznau 1 and 2, and Mühleberg) <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shut down {{as early as}} 2017, and every remaining plant by 2029. The initiative was rejected by 54.2% of voters.|$|R
50|$|Going {{into the}} last game of the 1949-50 season, Sheffield Wednesday needed a result against Tottenham Hotspur to secure second place and clinch {{promotion}} {{at the expense of}} their local rivals Sheffield United. The resulting 0-0 draw meant Wednesday won promotion by a goal average difference of just 0.008 - a 1-1 draw <b>would</b> <b>have</b> left the two level on points and goal average, and a unique play-off match <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> played.|$|R

5|$|It was {{believed}} that selective pressure, controlled by Washington, combined with diplomatic overtures, would prevail and compel Hanoi to end its aggression.

5|$|Lunar Surface Rendezvous: Two {{spacecraft}} {{would be}} launched in succession.

5|$|The Battle of Elephant Point was an {{airborne}} operation {{conducted by a}} composite Gurkha airborne battalion that took place on 1 May 1945. In March 1945, plans were made for an assault on Rangoon, the capital of Burma, as a stepping-stone {{on the way to}} recapturing Malaya and Singapore. Initial plans for the assault on the city had called for a purely land-based approach by British Fourteenth Army, but concerns about heavy Japanese resistance led to this being modified {{with the addition of a}} joint amphibious-airborne assault. This assault, led by 26th Indian Division, would sail up the Rangoon River, but before it could do so, the river <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cleared of Japanese and British mines. In order to achieve this, coastal defences along the river <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> neutralized, including a battery at Elephant Point.|$|E
5|$|The LCS also lacked {{knowledge}} of MI5's Double-Cross System and its double agents.

Thus, the underlying intrastate tensions remained, and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> addressed later.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} of what coolant to use attracted more debate. The Metallurgical laboratory's first choice was helium, {{because it could}} be both a coolant and a neutron moderator. The difficulties of its use were not overlooked. Large quantities would be required, and it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very pure, with no neutron-absorbing impurities. Special blowers {{would be required to}} circulate the gas through the reactor, and the problem of leakage of radioactive gases <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> solved. None of these problems were regarded as insurmountable. The decision to use helium was conveyed to DuPont, the company responsible for building the production reactors, and was initially accepted.|$|E
5|$|The {{review board}} {{concluded}} that the IKL/HDW Type2000 was the best design offered, the Walrus class was rated as 'fair', while Kockums' and Vickers' proposals were considered 'marginal' contenders. However, none of the tenders completely matched the desired RAN specifications, and the two proposals selected <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> redesigned during the funded study.|$|E

50|$|A working {{definition}} of ETCS only became available much later than originally planned, delaying {{the achievement of}} a speed of 200 km/h {{that had been a}} target {{since the beginning of the}} project in 1992.
