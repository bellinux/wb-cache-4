40|$|Eliminating a Major Cause of Wire Drawing Breakage in A- 15 High-Field Superconductors Phase 1 Summary Purpose of the research: The Phase 1 {{goal was}} to make a {{significant}} improvement in the wire drawing technology used for difficult to draw superconductor precursor composites. Many ductile Nb-Al and Nb-Sn precursor wire composites have experienced the onset of wire drawing breakage at about 1. 5 mm diameter. Phase 1 focused on evaluating the role that precision rigid guidance of the wire into the drawing die and the hydrostatic stress state at the die entrance played in preventing wire breakage. Research carried out: The research performed depended upon the construction of both a mechanical wire guide and a hydrostatic pressure stiffened wire guidance system. Innovare constructed the two wire guidance systems and tested them for their ability to reduce wire drawing breakage. One set of hardware provided rigid alignment of the wires to their <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>die</b> axes within 0. 35 degrees using ''hydrostatic pressure stiffening'' to enable the precision guidance strategy to be implemented for these highly flexible small diameter wires. This apparatus was compared to a guide arrangement that used short span mechanical guide alignment with a misalignment limit of about 0. 75 degrees. Four A- 15 composite wires with breakage histories were drawn to evaluate the use of these wire guiding systems to reduce and/or eliminate wire breakage. Research findings and results: In Phase 1, a breakthrough in wire drawing technology for A- 15 superconductor composites was achieved by dramatically limiting or eliminating breakage in four different A- 15 composite precursor wire designs during the drawing of these very desirable composites that previously could not be drawn to near final size. Research results showed that the proposed Phase 1 mechanical wire guides were sufficiently effective and successful in eliminating breakage when used along with other advanced wire drawing technology to justify the development of an integrated compact production type Advanced Wire Drawing Station. New insights into the formation and growth of a shear type defect that causes breakage lead to improved drawing technology and it will be the basis for further study and improvements included in a Phase 2 proposal. Potential application of the research: This new capability now justifies the development of an integrated compact production type Advanced Wire Drawing Station to replace the bulky, slower and research oriented equipment that currently uses four independent operations for each wire diameter reduction. In a Phase 2 proposal, the designs for each operation were to be optimized for their performance and so they could be used to integrate these individual operations into an Advanced Wire Drawing Station. This station will perform all the mechanical conditioning, cleaning, lubrication, guidance and drawing operations simultaneously and it will be tested to verify wire drawing performance targets. A portable Advanced Wire Drawing Station will be developed and constructed in the final stage of the proposed Phase 2 program and it will be used in an outside manufacturing facility for superconductor composite wire drawing field trials...|$|E

In all forming operations dimensions and surface finish of the products are of utmost importance. Forming basically includes three parts – forming conditions excluded – that may be changed; work material, tool and (possibly) lubricant. In the interface between work material and tool, the conditions are very aggressive with – generally or locally – high temperatures and pressures. The surfaces will be worn in various ways and this will change the conditions in the process. Consequently, the surface finish {{as well as the}} dimensions of the formed product may change and in the end, the product will not fulfil the requirements of the customer. Therefore, research and development in regard to wear, and consequently tribology, of the forming tools is of great interest. The investigations of <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>dies</b> focus on coating adhesion/cohesion, surface characteristics and material transfer onto the coated steel both in laboratory scale {{as well as in the}} <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> process. Results show that it in <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> is possible to enhance the tribological performance of <b>drawing</b> <b>dies</b> by using a lubricant together with a steel substrate coated by a polished, dual-layer coating containing both hard and friction-lowering layers.

Results show that an ideal hot work roll material should be made up of a matrix with high hardness and a large amount of complex, hard carbides evenly distributed in the microstructure. The surface failure mechanisms of work rolls are very complex involving plastic deformation, abrasive wear, adhesive wear, mechanical and thermal induced cracking, material transfer and oxidation.

40|$|<b>Wire</b> <b>drawing</b> is {{a plastic}} {{deformation}} process where a wire with circular cross-section is continuously reduced {{by making it}} flow through a conical converging die. As the material is drawn, it is plastically deformed and the mechanical properties of the material are modified. As the process is developed at room temperature {{and as a result}} of the introduced deformation, the yield stress of the processed material is increased due to the material strain hardening behaviour. Nevertheless, there exists a limitation in the reduction that can be applied in a single stage of drawing. This is related to the drawing instability and the imparted damage. The drawing instability appears when the process conditions become so hard that the drawing stress equals to the material flow stress and then the material necks in the drawing zone and the wire breaks. The damage the material undergoes is another limitation to the maximum reduction that can be made after a number of passages through different <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>dies.</b> The material can be processed but due to process conditions, cracks, wrinkles and defects can appear on the surface or inside the wire. The external defects can be detected by a visual inspection but the internal ones are more dangerous because they are more difficult to detect.

On the other hand, stress-strain curves have been measured at both low and high strain rates in the [20 - 150 °C] range, and {{used to compare the}} identified values of Wpl both with analytical estimations and numerical simulations of wire drawing; again, the thermo-mechanical model has been confirmed. This has allowed the friction stress to be measured for various metal soap lubricants. The experimental uncertainties and their impact on the identified friction stress have been analysed...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{inclusion}} size and length on copper shaped <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> were investigated. The deformations {{and the mean}} normal stress of copper shaped wires that contain an inclusion, were calculated by two-dimensional finite elemental analysis. The results, during <b>drawing</b> a <b>wire</b> containing an inclusion; necking occurred. The effects of inclusion size and length, on contact compressive stress during copper shaped <b>wire</b> <b>drawing</b> were carried out...|$|R
