40|$|The {{population}} of Astana, Kazakhstan, generates more than 1, 100 tons of {{municipal solid waste}} daily and they are deposited mostly without preliminary separation or other treatment in open dumps. Rapid growth of Astana population and ineffective waste management leads {{to the formation of}} illegal dumping. This leads to deterioration of sanitary and environmental conditions of the city. This project considers the possibility of depositing high organic content waste in engineered landfills or incineration plants for electricity and heat generation purposes. The objective of this research project is to assess and compare the landfill gas (LFG) and <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> (<b>WI)</b> solutions in terms of technical, environmental, and economic performance at a pre-feasibility level...|$|E
40|$|Protection of {{environment}} {{and human health}} is major concern for European Union. European Commission has established integrated pollution prevention and control directive and directives concerning large combustion plants (LCP) and <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> (<b>WI)</b> plants to prevent emissions from industrial installations. The LCP and WI directives set the lowest requirements such as emission limit values and monitoring requirements that the operators have to comply in EU. European Commission has also published best available technique (BAT) reference documents to help authorities determine the requirements in environmental permits for the installations. This thesis is looking into the authority requirements for continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) that are set by the competent authorities in Spain, Estonia, France, Poland, Czech and UK. Power plants have to monitor and report air emissions {{with the help of}} CEMS. It consists of measurement equipment, analysers and sample conditioning systems as well as environmental data management solution. Directives and standards set the requirements for the CEMS, but still requirements differ between the target countries. For instance, according to the study only in UK certification (MCERTS) for the analyser is required and only in Spain plant owner is not allowed to perform the compliance reporting of the plants emissions. It is the responsibility of competent authority. Also the charging and trading emissions differ between the target countries. The coming directive on industrial emissions will be possibly accepted in the end of 2010. It will unify and straiten the requirements. Emission limit values will lower and the emission monitoring requirements will be stricter. Due to the directive, the importance of the use of best available technique will be emphasized. BAT reference documents for large combustion plants and monitoring emissions are reviewed in 2010. The subject of this thesis was wide and the special requirements are presented in general level. Further studies can use this thesis as a ground for more detailed research in monitoring and reporting emissions from power plants in EU. More research should be done because monitoring of local environmental legislation of Member States is ongoing process. /Kir 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Recent bans on {{landfilling}} of combustible {{and organic}} waste in Sweden {{have resulted in}} an increase in alternative waste treatment, especially <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> with energy recovery. This thesis elucidates how the current increase in Swedish <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> affects and is affected by the two systems to which it belongs: the waste management and the energy systems. The work as a whole aims to contribute {{to the understanding of the}} future role of <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> as a <b>waste</b> treatment and energy recovery alternative. To investigate this, nine research questions are formulated. The methods used include utilisation of the energy systems models MARKAL-Nordic and HEATSPOT, various literature surveys, a questionnaire and the development of a spreadsheet model in order to estimate the net marginal cost of waste treatment methods that are alternatives to <b>waste</b> <b>incineration.</b> A general conclusion is that the role of incineration as the dominant waste treatment alternative for Swedish municipal solid waste (MSW) is likely to continue with the policy measures currently in force. From an energy systems perspective, this work suggests that the increase in <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> may have a large local effect in some district heating systems, where it affects alternative fuels and technologies. On a national scale, however, <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> covers only a small part of the demand of the energy system. It is clear that the effects of the increase in <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> vary with the local conditions of the district heating system where the <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> plants will operate, and that the methods applied vary in ability to detect the local differences. Biomass is the alternative fuel mainly affected by increased <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> on a national scale, but the environmental implications depend on the fate of the biomass saved through expanded <b>waste</b> <b>incineration.</b> This work also suggests that the type of fuel replaced when <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> increases can be one of the key factors in the environmental comparison of waste treatment methods. This thesis expects the recently introduced tax on the average fossil content of the household <b>waste</b> for <b>incineration,</b> to have an effect mainly on the alternative treatment of biological waste fractions, and even this effect is likely to be small, according to the proposed results of this work. The tax is not likely to contribute significantly to the goal of material recycling of plastic packaging waste, or to significantly affect the current driving forces for import of <b>waste</b> for <b>incineration</b> in Sweden. We expect information to be a key factor in transferring the governing force of the tax to the households as well as improving the households attitudes towards material recycling...|$|R

Various policy instruments currently introduced, for example tradable emission permits, tradable green certificates and the ban on land filling of combustible waste will have an impact on the role of heat pumps in district heating systems. In this paper, a case study of a district heating system is performed to analyze how the heat production of an existing heat pump and the possibilities to reinvest in a new heat pump if the existing is phased out is changed due to <b>waste</b> <b>incineration.</b> Results are obtained for several scenarios of policy instruments. In most scenarios used in the study, <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> will reduce the heat production from the heat pump. However, in some cases, <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> replaces an investment in combined heat and power that would have reduced the heat pump even more, thus the results indicate that the impact of <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> on heat pumps is ambiguous...|$|R
40|$|<b>Waste</b> <b>incineration</b> {{is the art}} of {{completely}} combusting waste, {{while maintaining}} or reducing emission levels below current emission standards. Where possible, objectives include the recovering of energy as well as the  combustion residues.   Successful <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> makes it possible to achieve a deep reduction in waste volume, obtain a compact and sterile residue, and eliminate a wide array of pollutants. This book places <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> within the wider context of waste management, and demonstrates that, in contrast to landfills and composting, <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> can eliminate objectionable and hazardous properties such as flammability and toxicity, result in a significant reduction in volume, and destroy gaseous and liquid waste streams leaving little or no residues beyond those linked to flue gas neutralization and treatment. Moreover, <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> sterilizes and destroys putrescible matter, and produces usable heat.   Incineration Technologies first appeared as a peer-reviewed contribution to  the Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology. It provides detailed treatment of the challenges of this technically complex process, which requires huge investment and operating costs, as well as good technical skills in maintenance and plant operation.   Particular attention is paid to technologies for ensuring the complete burn-out of flue gas and residues and for controlling the resulting pollutants...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{shows how the}} Fuzzy Autocatalytic Set (FACS) {{is transformed into a}} semigroup. Omega algebra is used as the main aspect to relate the FACS to the transformation semigroup of omega algebra of the FACS. Clinical <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> process is used as an example in supporting the developed theorems and lemmas. C++ programming is used to develop a customized program that computes the necessary data in supporting new theorems and lemmas. First, the FACS is defined in terms of omega algebra, giving the omega algebra of FACS. Next, the semigroup of omega algebra of FACS is constructed using the omega algebra of FACS. The membership value of fuzzy edge connectivity is also determined to complete the definition of the omega algebra of FACS. New definitions and terminologies are used to model the clinical <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> process in terms of omega algebra. As a result, the new model is shown to be able to comprehensively explain the catalytic relation amongst the chemical elements in the clinical <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> process. The established semigroup of omega algebra of FACS is then defined to be a transformation semigroup of omega algebra of FACS. The results show that FACS of the clinical <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> process and the structure of transformation semigroup of omega algebra of the clinical <b>waste</b> <b>incineration</b> process are “compatible”. In addition, the manifold representation of the transformation semigroup of omega algebra of FACS is proposed for further studie...|$|R
