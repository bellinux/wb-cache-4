5|$|In second {{practice}} on Thursday afternoon, Ricciardo was fastest, setting {{a time of}} 1:14.607, {{more than half a}} second clear of Hamilton in second place. Rosberg and Verstappen, in third and fourth, were the only other drivers to get within a second of Ricciardo, while the two Williams drivers Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa struggled, ending the session 14th and 16th respectively. At Ferrari, Kimi Räikkönen was fastest in seventh spot. His teammate, Vettel, had an incident-packed session that eventually ended with him setting the ninth fastest time. He spun at Mirabeau corner, damaging his rear wing, only to hit the wall in turn one after coming back to the track, albeit continuing with <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> damage. A VSC period occurred after Romain Grosjean crashed into the outside barrier at the exit of the tunnel. Two more VSC periods ensued when Rio Haryanto touched the inside barrier at the same spot and later after Kevin Magnussen crashed at the final corner.|$|E

25|$|The {{cause of}} the {{accident}} was a <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> which broke and damaged the train six kilometres south of the accident site. The <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> penetrated the carriage floor and lifted the check rail {{of a set of}} points close to Eschede station. The broken-off check rail then forced the point blades of the following set of points to change direction, and the rear cars of the trainset were diverted to a different track. They hit the pillars of a street overpass, which then collapsed onto the tracks. Only three cars and the front powerhead passed under the bridge, the rest of the 14-car train jackknifed into the collapsed bridge.|$|E

25|$|For 1964 Chevrolet {{made only}} {{evolutionary}} {{changes to the}} Corvette. Besides the coupe's backbone window, the two simulated air intakes were eliminated from the hood, though their indentations remained. Also, the decorative air-exhaust vent on the coupe's rear pillar was made functional, but only on the left side. The car's rocker-panel trim {{lost some of its}} ribs and gained black paint between those ribs that remained; wheel covers were simplified; and the fuel filler/deck emblem gained concentric circles around its crossed-flags insignia. Inside, the original color-keyed steering <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> was now done in simulated walnut.|$|E
25|$|The first {{update to}} the FG model was {{released}} {{in the second half}} of 2010. The Mk2 update adds several interior and exterior elements as standard to all vehicles. iPod Integration and Bluetooth are now standard across the range and all models except the XT receive an 8-inch colour touch screen. The popular ZF six-speed 6HP26 and 6HP21 (Ecoboost) automatic has also been made standard across the range, spelling the end of the successful four- and five-speed automatics. Other changes included an all new front bumper design, alternative <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> design, new floor mats and side step designs. All models receive curtain airbags.|$|E

25|$|A {{rim band}} brake, as {{implemented}} on the Yankee bicycle by Royce Husted in the 1990s, {{consists of a}} stainless-steel cable, wrapped in a kevlar sheath, that rides in a u-shaped channel {{on the side of}} the <b>wheel</b> <b>rim.</b> Squeezing the brake lever tightens the cable against the channel to produce braking friction. A return spring slackens the cable when the brake lever is released, no adjustment is required, and the brake becomes more forceful when wet. Husted said his inspiration was the band brake used on industrial machinery. The Yankee bicycle only included a rear brake, but that met U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission standards.|$|E
25|$|The Bennett {{fracture}} is {{an oblique}} intraarticular metacarpal fracture dislocation, {{caused by an}} axial force directed against the partially flexed metacarpal. This type of compression along the metacarpal bone is often sustained when a person punches a hard object, such as the skull or tibia of an opponent, or a wall. It can also occur {{as a result of}} a fall onto the thumb. This is a common injury sustained from bike falls, as the thumb is generally extended while around the handle bars. It is also a common injury in car crashes, especially into fixed objects, from the driver holding the steering wheel during impact. The hand moves forward, while the steering <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> hyperextends the thumb.|$|E
25|$|At {{its first}} race in Brazil, the F2002 was victorious, {{being driven by}} Michael Schumacher and {{continuing}} Ferrari's trend since 1999 for its cars to win on their debut. Michael Schumacher clinched second on the grid and after a first lap altercation with Juan Pablo Montoya, took a somewhat easy win from his brother Ralf's Williams. There was some controversy surrounding tyre allocation because the team only had one F2002 chassis at the race. Therefore, Schumacher's spare car was an F2001 chassis and because the two chassis used different <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> designs each required separate wheels and tyres. It was thus argued that Schumacher had in-effect twice the allocation of tyres as any other driver. The controversy was managed by Ferrari agreeing to aggregate their tyre usage between the two cars, ensuring that Schumacher used the same total number of tyres as all the other drivers.|$|E

25|$|The chassis {{design was}} as new as the bodies - with an all-new, {{sturdier}} perimeter frame, new chassis/body mounts, larger 8½inch rear axle, wider 6-inch <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> width, refined rear control arm bushings, increased {{front and rear}} suspension travel, new shock absorber location, and improved front suspension geometry - The left wheel was adjusted to have slightly more positive camber than the right {{which resulted in a}} more uniform and stable steering feel on high-crown road surfaces while maintaining excellent freeway cruise stability. Clearances for spring travel were also improved for a smoother ride over all types of surfaces; the coil springs at each wheel were computer-selected to match the individual car's weight. Front disc brakes were now standard on all '73 Chevelles. John Z. DeLorean, Chevrolet's dynamic general manager during the design phase of the new Chevelles, left just as they were being announced. He departed in late September 1972 to start a brief stint as vice president of General Motors's Car and Truck Group. DeLorean left the new Chevelle an important legacy, though. He and Alex Mair, then Chevrolet's chief engineer, championed great handling. Critics compared the GM Colonnade line favorably to Ford and Chrysler intermediates which had unattractive styling and less interior room.|$|E
25|$|On Sunday morning, a pre-race warm-up session {{took place}} at 11:00 local time, and lasted for 30minutes. It took place in dry weather conditions. Alesi led his {{teammate}} Berger {{at the top of}} the standings with a time of 1:24.356; both Ferrari drivers trying their race and spare cars. Schumacher was third, ahead of Häkkinen, Herbert, and Hill, who was concerned about the development of understeer in the handling of his race car, particularly in the track's slower corners. Coulthard set the 11th-fastest time, and the Williams team, worried about its cars' pace in race trim, opted to switch its planned pit strategy from one stop to two, hoping that the cars would handle better on the relatively lighter fuel load required for such tactics. Meanwhile, the Sauber mechanics had built up a new spare car for Frentzen (who was now driving the team's original spare car after the damage to his race car was found to be irreparable) and also repaired Boullion's damaged machine. Their Jordan counterparts had performed similar work on Irvine's car, whilst Barrichello's car suffered a broken <b>wheel</b> <b>rim.</b> Inoue was cleared to race, and set the slowest time of the session in the spare Footwork.|$|E

Also in 2003, Ford created a Centennial Edition Taurus to celebrate Ford's 100th anniversary. This special Taurus included many extras, such as lighter wood trim, special leather seats, headlights with black accents, special wheels, a special leather case for the owner's manual, a leather jacket that said [...] "Ford: 100 Years", a similar watch, and a letter from William Clay Ford, Jr. Production was limited to 4,000 units.|$|E
2500|$|Rial is a German {{producer}} of light alloy wheels and rims, {{and was a}} Formula One constructor competing in the [...] and [...] seasons. Founded in the 1970s as a <b>wheel</b> <b>rim</b> producer, the company was bought by Günter Schmid, ex-owner of the ATS wheels company in 1987. Schmid followed the same strategy as he had at ATS, advertising the Rial wheel brand by entering Formula One as a constructor. Rial participated in 32 Grands Prix, entering a total of 48 cars. They scored six championship points, finishing a highest of ninth in the constructors championship in 1988. After leaving Formula One {{at the end of}} the 1989 season, the Rial Racing division was closed, and the company did not race again. Rial continues to manufacture wheels and rims from its factory in Fußgönheim.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1980, Mazda {{released}} a {{limited production run}} of special North American models known as the Leathersport Models. This package was essentially an uprated GS model with added LS badges on each B-pillar, special striping, and LS-only gold anodized wheels (with polished outer face and <b>wheel</b> <b>rim).</b> All LS editions came equipped with special LS-only full brown leather upholstery, leather wrapped steering wheel, leather wrapped shift knob, removable sunroof, LS-specific four-speaker AM/FM stereo radio with power antenna (though listed as a six speaker stereo, as the two rear dual voice coil speakers were counted as four speakers in total), remote power door side mirrors, and other standard GS equipment. Two primary options were also available; a three-speed JATCO 3N71B automatic transmission and air conditioning. Other GS options such as cassette tape deck, splash guards, padded center console arm rest and others could be added by the dealer. The LS model was only ever available in three different exterior colors: Aurora White, Brilliant Black, and Solar Gold. No official production records are known to exist or to have been released. This series of RX-7 had exposed steel bumpers and a high-mounted indentation-located license plate, called by Werner Buhrer of Road & Track magazine a [...] "Baroque depression." ...|$|E
