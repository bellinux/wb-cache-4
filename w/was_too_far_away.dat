5|$|Chauvel assumed {{command of}} the newly formed Anzac Mounted Division on 16 March 1916, the day after it {{relieved}} the 1st Division on the Suez Canal defences. Chauvel was again mentioned in despatches {{for his part in}} the defence of the Canal. His division was committed to No. 3 Section of the Suez Canal Defences, {{the northern part of the}} Canal, under Major General H. A. Lawrence. Arrangements were far from ideal. The mounted troops were parcelled out so that only two brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division remained under Chauvel's command. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade had been placed under No. 2 Section by General Sir Archibald Murray GHQ Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF). Lawrence <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> to control the battle, especially once the telephone lines were cut. Murray, in Ismailia, was even further back.|$|E

At Quetzaltepeque a lengthy battle was fought between the Tzeltal Maya and the Spanish, resulting in the deaths of a number of Spanish as a result of rocks being cast down upon them from the mountaintop. The battle lasted various days, and the Spanish were supported by indigenous warriors from central Mexico.

5|$|Joan Young, who was {{the only}} {{first-hand}} witness, is challenged in both articles. She came forward in 2004, claiming {{that she had seen}} someone push something over the side of a boat on Coniston Water. This testimony is challenged, because so much time has passed and the fact that her husband saw nothing. However, he claims to have been reading his paper at the time. Also, {{it has been said that}} Young <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> to identify the person in the boat, and that it couldn't have been Carol Park's body that was being dumped, as the Youngs were positioned so that the location Carol's body was found would have been visibly blocked by an island. The article even points out that Young described a boat that appeared to be a cruiser yacht. Despite the fact that Gordon did own a large yacht in 1997, in 1976 he owned only a 505 racing dinghy, which he sold later that year.|$|E
5|$|During {{the opening}} days of 1994, Rewa moved southwards {{parallel}} to the Queensland coast; however, because it was located about 600km (370mi) to the north-east of Mackay, it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> from the coast {{for there to be}} any direct impact on Queensland. The only indirect impact was higher surf, from which several people had to be rescued from before the cyclone started to move towards New Caledonia during 4January. As Rewa affected Queensland for the second time, watches and warnings were issued for various parts of Queensland by TCWC Brisbane, who predicted a landfall near Mackay. On 18 January local disaster committees met to consider evacuating people, while people who were on vacation in national parks were alerted about Rewa by a helicopter. A military training exercise that was due to take place in Shoalwater Bay had to be cancelled, with army personal evacuated to Rockhampton to avoid being cut off by flood waters. Along the coast, several ports including Gladstone were shut with large vessels told to head to sea and small vessels told to batten down and prepare for the storm.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Andrea Doria {{participated in}} several {{operations}} intended to catch British convoys in the Mediterranean, including the Operation Excess convoys in January 1941. By {{the end of}} the year, both battleships were tasked with escorting convoys from Italy to North Africa to support the Italian and German forces fighting there. These convoys included Operation M41 on 13 December and Operation M42 on 17–19 December. During the latter, Andrea Doria and Giulio Cesare engaged British cruisers and destroyers in the First Battle of Sirte {{on the first day of}} the operation. Neither the Italians nor the British pressed their attacks and the battle ended inconclusively. Caio Duilio was assigned to distant support for the operation, and <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> to actively participate in the battle. Convoy escort work continued into early 1942, but thereafter the fleet began to suffer from a severe shortage of fuel, which kept the ships in port for the next two years. Caio Duilio sailed away from Taranto on 14 February with a pair of light cruisers and seven destroyers in order to intercept the British convoy MW 9, bounded from Alexandria to Malta, but the force could not locate the British ships, and so returned to port. After learning of Caio Duilio departure, however, British escorts scuttled the transport Rowallan Castle, previously disabled by German aircraft.|$|E

5|$|On 30 September MacLachlan flew in defence of London {{as a large}} raid {{sought to}} attack the city. The RAF fighters {{performed}} well but 73 Squadron did not encounter the enemy. As September ended the Luftwaffe began sending fighter-bombers (Jabos)—bomb carrying Bf 109s—over England. The following day MacLachlan was promoted to flight lieutenant in view of his experience. On 7 October he intercepted one such raid and engaged in air-to-air combat {{for the first time}} as a fighter pilot. At 09:50 the unit was scrambled to defend Chelmsford. Flying with No. 257 Squadron they overflew the Thames Estuary. No contact was made. At 12:30 they were scrambled again. This time MacLachlan spotted two Bf 109s at 20,000 feet. Six more attacked the squadron and MacLachlan managed to fire a burst which hit one and it dove away emitting smoke and gained a probable victory. On 12 October 1940 MacLachlan pursued a Heinkel He 111 over Castle Camps but could not catch the enemy machine which <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> at high altitude. It proved to be his last encounter with the enemy during the Battle of Britain.|$|E
5|$|The Dalmatian {{front was}} a {{separate}} theater of operations, which {{was involved in}} the early phase of the war. The conditions there were almost reverse to those in Crete: for the Ottomans, it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> <b>away</b> and relatively insignificant, while the Venetians operated near their own bases of supply and had undisputed control of the sea, being thus able to easily reinforce their coastal strongholds. In addition, and again unlike Crete, the Venetians enjoyed the support of much of the local population, particularly the Morlacchi. The Ottomans launched a large-scale attack in 1646, and made some significant gains, including the capture of the islands of Krk, Pag and Cres, and most importantly, the supposedly impregnable fortress of Novigrad, which surrendered on 4 July, after only two days of bombardment. The Ottomans were now able to threaten the two main Venetian strongholds in Dalmatia, Zadar and Split. In the next year however, the tide turned, as the Venetian commander Leonardo Foscolo seized several forts, retook Novigrad, temporarily captured the fortress of Knin and took Klis, while a month-long siege of the fortress of Šibenik by the Ottomans in August and September failed. During the next few years, military operations stalled because of an outbreak of famine and plague amongst the Venetians at Zadar, while both sides focused their resources in the Aegean area. As other fronts took priority for the Ottomans, no further operations occurred in the Dalmatian theater. Peace in 1669 found the Republic of Venice with significant gains in Dalmatia, its territory tripled, and its control of the Adriatic thus secured.|$|E
