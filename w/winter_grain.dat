[...] Humans often conduct activities {{that allow for}} the incorporation of other species, whether as a by-product or {{as a result of}} a focus on nature. [...] Traditional natural history can only inform how best to do this to a certain degree, because landscapes have been changed so dramatically. [...] However, there is much more to learn through direct study of species' ecology in human-dominated ecosystems, through what is known as focused natural history. [...] Rosenzweig [...] cites four examples: shrikes (Laniidae) thrived in altered landscapes when wooden fence post perches allowed them easy access to pouncing on prey, but inhospitable steel fence posts contributed to their decline. [...] Replacing steel fence posts with wood fence posts reverses the shrikes' decline and allows humans to determine the reasons for the distribution and abundance of shrikes. [...] Additionally, the cirl bunting (Emberiza cirlus) thrived on farms when fields alternated between harvests and hay, but declined where farmers began to plant <b>winter</b> <b>grain</b> crops, natterjack toads (Bufo calamatus) declined when reductions in sheep grazing ceased to alter ponds to their preferred shape and depth, and longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) declined in the Southeastern United States when lack of wildfires prevented its return after timbering. [...] Thus, applying focused natural history in human-dominated landscapes can contribute to conservation efforts.|$|E

5000|$|Miry usually {{practiced the}} common-field system, {{in which all}} peasants grew the same crop in the same part of the mir's arable at the same time. Thus the whole harvest on a {{particular}} area could be gathered at the same time. This was necessary because of the peasants' custom of pasturing their livestock on the stubble. To preserve soil fertility on the arable, the mir generally employed a crop-rotation with fallow. The distribution of different crops would be `cycled' around from year to year. The most widespread system in use was the three-course or triennial rotation. One-third of the land was dedicated to <b>winter</b> <b>grain</b> (rye or winter wheat), another third to spring grain (oats or spring wheat) and the remainder lay fallow. [...] Other crops (e.g. legumes, vetches) were occasionally grown with the grain and {{took part in the}} same cycle.

50|$|The first {{twelve years}} of the Weimar Republic were in the Rhineland a time of French occupation. In June 1920, a {{shooting}} range (Champ de tir de Kirn) was set up near Merxheim. Between 5 and 11 July, in the area among Merxheim, Meckenbach, Krebsweiler, Heimbach, Limbach, Kirschroth, Meddersheim and on the Nahe’s banks from Merxheim to Sobernheim, artillery exercises were conducted. Bärweiler’s municipal area bordered in the southeast on the restricted area. Bärweiler was, {{at least in the}} beginning, more heavily affected by the shooting range. In the time from 21 to 27 August 1920, the French artillery once more conducted live shooting exercises at the troop drilling ground. Part of Bärweiler’s municipal area also lay in the danger zone. Some 60 ha of it was affected. In September 1920, 12 ha of land was to be sown with <b>winter</b> <b>grain</b> and another 10 with potatoes. After an order from the French general of the Rhine Army, the live shooting exercises were restricted to Sundays, Mondays and Fridays until noon. Thus, the farmers raising the aforesaid crops could use the rest of that time to tend them. Otherwise, the Merxheim shooting range did not affect life in Bärweiler much at all. Most neighbouring villages, on the other hand, from 1919 to 1920 and in later years, {{had to put up with}} billeting of a great number of occupational troops when exercises were being conducted. In the 1920s, not only the clubs offered opportunities for communication but also as gathering places there were one or two inns. Only in 1928/1929 was the first kermis (church consecration festival, locally known as the Kerb) after the war held. Unlike what happened in the cities, the high unemployment that characterized the 1920s in Germany had no direct effects in Bärweiler. Many family members could find modest livelihoods in farming or forestry (for example in barking). Many women and girls from Bärweiler, Hundsbach, Lauschied and other villages lived “in the beggarliest circumstances”. Even the Ewald gelatine works was short of manpower.|$|E

NIRS calibrations were developed for <b>winter</b> <b>grain</b> samples collected over three years in the Western Cape region of South Africa. Winter grains used in the study include oats, barley, triticale and wheat. Calibrations were also developed for maize samples collected throughout South Africa. <b>Winter</b> <b>grain</b> samples were analysed for ash, dry matter (DM), crude protein content (CP), fat content, acid detergent fibre (ADF), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD), lysine and methionine. The digestible energy (DE) content of <b>winter</b> <b>grain</b> samples was determined by the mobile nylon bag technique on pigs. Maize samples were analysed for ash, DM, CP, IVOMD and TDN (total digestible nutrients). Standard errors of prediction (SEP) and multiple correlation coefficients (r) for the different <b>winter</b> <b>grain</b> constituents were respectively; ash (0. 22 %; 0. 87), DM (0. 67 % 0. 68), CP (0. 60 %; 0. 93); fat (0. 19 %; 0. 99), ADF (0. 88 %; 0. 98), NDF (2. 13 %; 0. 97), IVOMD (2. 06 %; 0. 97), DE (0. 76 %; 0. 91), lysine (0. 04 %; 0. 93) and methionine (0. 01 %; 0. 90).
