500|$|In the Gold Medal {{match in}} London, the team faced the Australia women's {{national}} wheelchair basketball team, who had defeated them 48–46 in Sydney {{just a few}} months before, in front of a capacity crowd of over 12,000 at the North Greenwich Arena. The German team had been undefeated up to that point, but had started off slow in its games against the United States and China, winning these games by six-point margins, and seemed to play its best basketball only in the final minutes of a game. Adermann scored 19 points, more than any other player in the match, and was a key factor in Germany winning 58-44. [...] "Most of my shots weren’t even any crazy shots or any outside shots,” Adermann said. [...] "They were the same shots I took in the others games, but I played more in this game, and I had many more easy opportunities getting into the paint." [...] "I’m always one of the shooters, but I think Australia underestimated me and didn’t defend me {{as well as some of}} the other girls. They left me open a lot and I got some big shots, so it went <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> It just worked out that I scored the most points in the final, but it wasn’t deliberate." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{executive}} producer, Price {{was responsible}} for [...] "shaping the album's sound", deciding its track listing, and mixing the songs {{in order to ensure}} that they [...] "feel like they're part of the same album". Popjustice commented that every song on the album has [...] "gone through a bit of a Stuart Price filter so that it doesn't sound like some dickhead [...] A has just aimlessly scooped a load of tracks off a shelf". Aphrodite marked the first time Minogue enlisted an executive producer; discussing the process, she said [...] "It was just the best experience, and funnily enough I think it's the most cohesive album I've had since the beginning of my career, back in the PWL days, where by its very nature made it cohesive. There's a lot to be said for working with different producers and trying different stuff which has worked really <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> in the past but I definitely wanted someone to tie this together as Stuart has done so beautifully [...] so that it existed as a real body of work". Minogue and Price subjected songs on Aphrodite to a [...] "Parton Test", as they [...] "knew a song would work if it made sense when sung in the style of Dolly Parton". Shears also contributed to the album, while two of Pallot's collaborations with Minogue were kept. Additional collaborators on the album include Scottish disc jockey Calvin Harris, Swedish disc jockey Sebastian Ingrosso and Belgian musician Pascal Gabriel.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode title}} is a {{reference}} to the television series The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and the town of Jupiter, Florida, which is where Reynolds spent most of his childhood. Sterling proclaims that his career path was largely influenced by Reynolds' film career, particularly his work in the musical film At Long Last Love (1975) and the spy cinema Operation C.I.A. (1965). Reed stated, [...] "Archer says [...] Operation C.I.A. is why [...] became a spy. And [...] like, 'Really, I thought that movie sucked.'" [...] A sequence which features Sterling strapping Reynolds onto a handtruck reflects homage to the thriller film The Silence of the Lambs (1991). The song [...] "East Bound and Down" [...] by Jerry Reed is presented in the episode, while Sterling makes several references to several American cinematic works from the 1970s. Jesse Carp of Cinema Blend wrote: [...] "I should start by saying that this episode played particularly <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> because I’m a huge fan of 1970s American cinema—the good and the bad—so all of those references that Archer soon starts throwing at Reynolds, I'm catching and loving every second of it." [...] "The Man from Jupiter" [...] contains several scenes that are reminiscent to those in the action film Gator (1976). Carp wrote that [...] "it isn't long before the Reynolds' sweet talking and charisma mesmerizes Archer and soon the pair are talking plot possibilities for the last film in the Gator trilogy." ...|$|E

500|$|His first {{appearance}} of 2007–08 {{came as a}} 75th-minute substitute in a 2–0 defeat away to Darlington on 11 August 2007 and following a 2–1 away defeat against Bradford City on 25 August he said [...] "I'm pleased with my form at the moment because I've been working hard to try {{and stay in the}} team and I'm happy that things seem to be going <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> at the moment". Mackin joined Conference Premier club Droylsden on 24 January 2008 on a one-month loan, having made seven appearances for Wrexham by that point in 2007–08. He made his debut two days later in a 1–0 home victory over Kidderminster Harriers and on 31 January 2008 the loan was extended {{until the end of the}} season after earning [...] "rave reviews" [...] for his performances. His only goal for Droylsden came in the 70th minute against Torquay United on 1 April 2008, which was their only goal in a 2–1 home defeat. He made 15 appearances and scored 1 goal for Droylsden before returning to Wrexham after being recalled from the loan in April 2008. The four appearances he made following his return were described as [...] "battling", and the last of these included his first goal for Wrexham in a 4–2 win away to Lincoln City on 3 May 2008, which was Wrexham's final match in the Football League before their relegation to the Conference Premier. He later commented [...] "I got a little touch on it and I'm not sure if the defender got the final touch but it went straight in and I'm very pleased with it!" [...] He finished the season with 11 appearances and 1 goal for Wrexham, with opportunities in the team again being rare.|$|E

But I am really happy with myself; things have been going <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I rode well in Europe last year." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} June, Tunney competed at the British Championships in Liverpool, United Kingdom. [...] This is {{the third}} and final Olympic Trial to decide the gymnasts that will {{represent}} the United Kingdom at the Olympics. [...] She won the all around competition with a score of 56.750. [...] She said, [...] "It’s totally unexpected to win. The main focus with it being the Olympic trial was to stay clean and I thought if I did that I could get maybe in the top 5 but to win is incredible. The trials have all gone really <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> so it’s now just up to the selectors to decide what works best for the Olympics. The first year as a senior couldn’t have gone better really and I’m really enjoying competed in front of big crowds. Having won the junior title last year and moved straight up to win seniors is brilliant, I’m very happy." [...] In event finals, she placed second on uneven bars scoring 14.350, fifth on balance beam scoring 13.550, and fourth on floor scoring 13.500.|$|E
2500|$|Huis {{said of his}} victory: [...] "It's very {{exciting}} to be here, racing in conjunction with pro drivers {{during one of the}} most renowned tech forward events. And to be the ultimate grand victor with Faraday Future Dragon Racing is thrilling." [...] Second-place finisher Rosenqvist stated that the simulation racing environment was new to all the professional racing drivers but was delighted with his achievement and expressed his hope of competing in future eRaces: [...] "In the end it worked out very <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> and I was up the at front in every session. Luckily, in the final I started from the front row and had a very clean race with a long first stint, without any traffic, and I was able to cruise to the podium in P2." [...] Despite his twelve-second penalty for the overuse of FanBoost, Pahkala was sanguine, feeling that the worlds of simulation and real life racing belong together and reserved praise for the development of motor racing eSport events: [...] "In the end, P3 was more than welcome for me. It’s been a blast! I made some mistakes in the practice session preparation which cost me pace later on and P3 is more than fair for everyone with what happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|I told Foster I {{should hold}} {{him for the}} money, and the old man, Van Triplett, said we acted as if we could not trust him, and gave {{some of the money}} back, and then said he would give us a chance to win it , so Foster turned the right card and [...] started to give him the money, but said, ‘Supposing you had bet that in earnest, did you have the money to put up?’ Foster said, ‘No,’ and turning to me said, ‘You have the money,’ and I said no, I did not have any money; that he took it all, but he said, ‘You have some dust,’ and wanted me to get it just to show the old man that we had the money in case the bet had been a real one. Bowers and I went to Kaufman’s store to get the money and Van Triplett and Foster {{remained}} behind. We came back with the dust and I unrolled it and showed them the sack, and the old man {{said he did not know}} if that was gold, and Bowers said, ‘Open it and show it to him, as he don’t know gold dust when he sees it,’ but I did not open it, and [...] just about to roll it up again, when Foster grabbed it and handing it to the old man, said, “Git!” and I started to grab the old man when they held me and said if I made a noise it would not be <b>well</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I pulled away from them and started after the old man, but could not see him and then went across the street and asked a party where there was an officer: that I had been robbed of $3,000 by some men over there.|$|E
