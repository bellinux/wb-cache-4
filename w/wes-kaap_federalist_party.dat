50|$|The <b>Federalist</b> <b>Party</b> {{came into}} being between 1792 and 1794 as a {{national}} coalition of bankers and businessmen in support of Alexander Hamilton's fiscal policies. These supporters developed into the organized <b>Federalist</b> <b>Party,</b> which was committed to a fiscally sound and nationalistic government. The only Federalist president was John Adams; although George Washington was broadly sympathetic to the Federalist program, he remained officially non-partisan during his entire presidency.|$|R
50|$|While the Federalist {{movement}} of the 1780s and the <b>Federalist</b> <b>Party</b> were distinct entities, they were related in {{more than just a}} common name. The Democratic-Republican Party, the opposition to the <b>Federalist</b> <b>Party,</b> emphasized the fear that a strong national government was a threat to the liberties of the people. They stressed that the national debt created by the new government would bankrupt the country, and that federal bondholders were paid from taxes paid by honest farmers and workingmen. These themes resonated with the Anti-Federalists, the opposition to the Federalist {{movement of}} the 1780s. As Norman Risjord has documented for Virginia, of the supporters of the Constitution in 1788, 69% joined the <b>Federalist</b> <b>party,</b> while nearly all (94%) of the opponents joined the Republicans. 71% of Thomas Jefferson's supporters in Virginia were former anti-federalists who continued to fear centralized government, while only 29% had been proponents of the Constitution a few years before. In short, nearly all of the opponents of the Federalist movement became opponents of the <b>Federalist</b> <b>Party.</b>|$|R
