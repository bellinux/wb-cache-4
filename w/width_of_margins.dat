40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{assess the}} effect of {{surgical}} margin width on recurrence rates after intestinal resection of Crohn's Disease (CD). BACKGROUND: The optimal <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>margins</b> when resecting DC of the small bowel is controversial. Most studies have been retrospective and have had conflicting results. METHODS: Patients undergoing ileocolic resection for CD (N = 152) {{were randomly assigned to}} two groups in which the proximal line of resection was 2 cm (limited resection) or 12 cm (extended resection) from the macroscopically involved area. Patients also were classified by whether the margin of resection was microscopically normal (category 1), contained nonspecific changes (category 2), were suggestive but not diagnostic for CD (category 3), or were diagnostic for CD (category 4). Recurrence was defined as reoperation for recurrent preanastomotic disease. RESULTS: Data were collected on 131 patients. Median follow-up time was 55. 7 months. Disease recurred in 29 patients: 25 % of patients in the limited resection group and 18 % of patients in the extended resection group. In the 90 patients in category 1 with normal tissue, recurrence occurred in 16, whereas in the 41 patients with some degree of microscopic involvement, recurrence occurred in 13. Recurrence rates were 36 % in category 2, 39 % in category 3, and 21 % in category 4. No group differences were statistically at the 0. 01 level. CONCLUSION: Recurrence of CD is unaffected by the width of the margin of resection from macroscopically involved bowel. Recurrence rates also do not increase when microscopic CD is present at the resection margins. Therefore, extensive resection margins are unnecessary...|$|E

40|$|When did the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>margins</b> in a page {{become less}} {{important}} than having {{a small number of}} pages in a book? We have been inundated by badly printed material since most publishers are now mostly interested in getting as much profit as possible, leaving the art of publishing aside. The premise of book designers should be not only to create attractive printed material but also to provide a pleasant reading experience. There are quite a few examples of designs that are now considered classics because they have proven themselves to be aesthetically incomparable. These designs include: Ternary canon: 2 : 3 page proportions where the height of the typographic box is equal to the width of the page, the left margin is half the right margin and the top margin is half the bottom margin. Gutenberg’s Göttingen Bible: same as above but in two columns with a wide column separation. Universal scaling: the page is created when the user defines a unit box and the design takes multiples of three times the unit box; the left margin is the unit’s box width, the top margin is the unit’s box height, and the right and bottom margins are twice the unit’s box width and height respectively. Diagonal and double diagonal methods: the page dimensions and the left margin are provided by the user and all the other elements are defined in terms of either a diagonal or using both diagonals. ISO 216 : the typographic box is sized either A 5 or A 6 depending on the choice of A 4 or A 5 paper size, and the left and top margins are half the right and bottom margins respectively. 2 – 3 – 4 – 6 system: page dimensions and the margin unit are defined by the user, and the typographic box is adapted to have two, three, four, and six times the margin unit as left, top, right and bottom margins respectively. This paper presents classics, the author’s new class which allows the user to typeset camera-ready books using any of the above designs. This class uses the calc and geometry packages to create the design, and crop to generate the crop marks. If classics is used with Hàn Thê ´ Thành’s micro-typographic extensions, the user will get state-of-the-art printed material. Let’s recover centuries of publishing tradition...|$|E

After the surgeon removed the lesions surrounded by 1 - 2 -cm margins, the pathologist determined margin width at the 4 cardinal points of 86 lesions (for a total <b>of</b> 344 <b>margin</b> assessments), first macroscopically and then under the microscope. A safety <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> 0. 8 cm on microscopic view was achieved in 83 % of cases (112 of 135) when the macroscopic measurement was 1 cm, in 91 % of cases (58 of 64) when it was 1. 5 cm, and 98 % of cases (105 of 107) when it was 2 cm. There was a small discrepancy between the surgeon's intent and the microscopic margin measurement, mostly related to tissue shrinkage. A 1 -cm surgical margin corresponded to a 0. 8 -cm margin in microscopic view (the "safe margin") in most cases. Copyright © 2011 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the prognostic value of postoperative concentration of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and extent <b>of</b> surgical <b>margins</b> after resection <b>of</b> liver metastases from colorectal cancer. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Teaching hospital, Switzerland. SUBJECTS: 49 patients with hepatic metastases after primary colorectal cancer. INTERVENTIONS: Resection of hepatic metastases MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Assessment of prognostic value of variables by univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Median survival was 24 months (range 5 - 86 months). Resection margins were clear (> 1 -cm) in 10, close (< 1 -cm) in 25 and invaded in 9 patients. On univariate analysis, a postoperative concentration of CEA of < 4 ng/ml {{was correlated with}} prolonged survival (p < 0. 001), but the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the resection <b>margin</b> was not <b>of</b> prognostic importance. There was no correlation between <b>width</b> <b>of</b> resection <b>margins</b> and postoperative concentration of CEA (p = 0. 5).

The mean <b>width</b> <b>of</b> peritumoral surgical <b>margin</b> was 2. 61 ± 2. 15 mm in OPN group (n = 385), significantly wider than the 2. 29 ± 2. 00 mm of RPN group (n = 317) (p = 0. 042). The multivariate analysis showed surgical methods was significant factors to narrow surgical margin less than 1 mm (p = 0. 031). After propensity score matching, the surgical margin width was significantly longer in OPN (2. 67 ± 2. 14 mm) group than RPN (2. 25 ± 2. 03 mm) group (p = 0. 016). A positive resection margin occurred in 7 (1. 8 %) patients in the OPN group and 4 (1. 3 %) in the RPN group. During the median follow-up of 48. 3 months, two patients who underwent OPN had tumor bed recurrence. RPN {{may result in a}} narrower peritumoral surgical margin than OPN. Further investigation on the potential impact of such a phenomenon should be performed in a larger-scale study...|$|R

40|$|Histological {{reporting}} of hepatic resections of colorectal liver metastases (CRLMs) {{is limited to}} confirmation of diagnosis and evaluation <b>of</b> resection <b>margins.</b> More exhaustive diagnostic reporting might be warranted. Here, we critically and systematically review the potentially important histological prognostic factors in CRLM. Histological features such as intrahepatic spread, resection margins, and tumour response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy have been defined. Intrahepatic spread (venous, lymphatic, bile duct and perineural invasion) was evaluated {{in a number of}} studies. Meta-analysis demonstrated a clear correlation between 5 -year overall survival and both portal vein invasion (RR 1. 8, 95 % CI 1. 3 - 2. 5) and lymphatic invasion (RR 1. 7, 95 % CI 1. 4 - 2. 0). The impact of hepatic vein invasion and bile duct invasion on outcome is not clear. Perineural invasion was linked to survival in one study. Resection margin is an important prognostic factor; however, the significance <b>of</b> the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> negative <b>margins</b> remains controversial. Various studies have evaluated tumour response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but different grading systems were used, and definite recommendations cannot be made. In conclusion, with the high incidence of CRLM and {{the increase in the number}} of hepatic resections, we need well-defined prognostic factors, studied in homogeneous patient populations, to optimize diagnostic work-up. This review identifies several of these factor...|$|R
40|$|A new {{classification}} method is proposed, called Support Hy- perplanes (SHs). To solve the binary classification task, SHs consider {{the set of}} all hyperplanes that do not make classification mistakes, referred to as semi-consistent hyperplanes. A test object is classified using that semi-consistent hyperplane, which is farthest away from it. In this way, a good balance between goodness-of-fit and model complexity is achieved, where model complexity is proxied by the distance between a test object and a semi-consistent hyperplane. This idea of complexity resembles the one imputed in the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the so-called <b>margin</b> between two classes, which arises {{in the context of}} Support Vector Machine learning. Class overlap can be handled via the introduction of kernels and/or slack vari- ables. The performance of SHs against standard classifiers is promising on several widely-used empirical data sets...|$|R
