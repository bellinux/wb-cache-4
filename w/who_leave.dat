25|$|Since the {{founding}} of the State of Israel, polls have shown that those leaving the country were on average more educated than the ones who remained in Israel. This phenomenon is even more extreme amongst new immigrants <b>who</b> <b>leave</b> Israel than amongst native-born Israelis <b>who</b> <b>leave</b> Israel. Therefore, the emigration from Israel has occasionally been referred to as a Brain drain. An OECD estimate put the highly educated emigrant rate at 5.3 per thousand highly educated Israelis, actually placing Israel in the lower third compared to OECD countries where the overall average was 14 per thousand highly educated emigrants. Israel, with its well developed technical and educational infrastructure and larger base of highly educated citizens, is retaining a greater percentage of its highly educated persons than developed countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands, Finland, Denmark and New Zealand.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} argued that an {{interstellar}} mission that cannot be completed within 50 years should not be started at all. Instead, assuming that a civilization is still on an increasing curve of propulsion system velocity and not yet having reached the limit, the resources should be invested in designing a better propulsion system. This is because a slow spacecraft would probably be passed by another mission sent later with more advanced propulsion (the incessant obsolescence postulate). On the other hand, Andrew Kennedy has shown that if one calculates the journey time to a given destination as the rate of travel speed derived from growth (even exponential growth) increases, there is a clear minimum in the total time to that destination from now. Voyages undertaken before the minimum will be overtaken by those <b>who</b> <b>leave</b> at the minimum, whereas those <b>who</b> <b>leave</b> after the minimum will never overtake those who left at the minimum.|$|E

25|$|Most {{children}} <b>who</b> <b>leave</b> home {{to live on}} {{the streets}} come from slums or low cost housing, both which are areas of high illiteracy, drug use, and unemployment. Children usually transfer their lives to the streets through a gradual process; they may at first only stay on the street a night or two. Gradually they will spend more time away from home until they do not return.|$|E

25|$|The law {{requires}} employers {{to ensure their}} employees against accidents at the workplace and when traveling to and from work.

However, workers <b>who</b> <b>leave</b> the workplace before it has been proven unsafe risk being fired; in such cases the worker has the right to judicial appeal, but the process can be very lengthy.|$|E
25|$|The sora's {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} marshes {{throughout much of}} North America. They nest in a well-concealed location in dense vegetation. The female usually lays 10 to 12 eggs, sometimes as many as 18, in a cup built from marsh vegetation. The eggs do not all hatch together. Both parents incubate and feed the young, <b>who</b> <b>leave</b> the nest soon after they hatch {{and are able to}} fly within a month.|$|E
25|$|Becoming {{self-employed}} {{can increase}} subjective well-being, {{given the right}} conditions.

Those who are self-employed and have employees of their own report higher life-satisfaction {{than those who are}} self-employed without employees, and women who are self-employed without employees report a higher life satisfaction than men in the same condition.|$|E

Mexico's National Population Council estimates that 600,000 natives of Zacatecas now live in the United States, a figure that is equivalent to 40 percent of the state's resident population of 1.5 million.|$|E
