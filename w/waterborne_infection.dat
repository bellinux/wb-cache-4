50|$|Infection {{with the}} {{introduced}} parasitic tapeworm Spirometra erinaceieuropaei is considered fatal for the echidna. This <b>waterborne</b> <b>infection</b> is contracted through sharing drinking areas with infected dogs, foxes, cats, and dingos, {{which do not}} die from the parasite. The infection is seen as being more dangerous in drier areas, where more animals are sharing fewer bodies of water, increasing the chance of transmission. The Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland runs an Australia-wide survey, called Echidna Watch, to monitor the species. Echidnas are also known {{to be affected by}} other tapeworms, protozoans and herpes-like viral infections, but little is known of how the infections affect the health of the animals or the populations.|$|E
50|$|The {{disease is}} endemic in North America {{and parts of}} Europe and Asia. The most common mode of {{transmission}} is via arthropod vectors. Ticks involved include Amblyomma, Dermacentor, Haemaphysalis, and Ixodes. Rodents, rabbits, and hares often serve as reservoir hosts, but <b>waterborne</b> <b>infection</b> accounts for 5 to 10% of all tularemia in the US. Tularemia can also be transmitted by biting flies, particularly the deer fly Chrysops discalis. Individual flies can remain infective for 14 days and ticks for over two years. Tularemia may also be spread by direct contact with contaminated animals or material, by ingestion of poorly cooked flesh of infected animals or contaminated water, or by inhalation.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To {{assess the}} recent {{advances}} {{in the field of}} <b>waterborne</b> nosocomial <b>infections.</b> RECENT FINDINGS: In the last year, many publications have confirmed the importance of well known nosocomial waterborne pathogens such as Legionella spp. or other Gram-negative bacteria, especially non-fermentative bacilli. There have also been numerous reports of outbreaks or pseudo-outbreaks caused by Mycobacteria spp. The most intriguing information relates to the possibility that some fungi causing nosocomial infections may originate from the hospital water distribution system. SUMMARY: Despite progress in understanding the pathogenesis of nosocomial <b>waterborne</b> <b>infections,</b> outbreaks, pseudo-outbreaks and sporadic infections still occur. Targeted quality control of hospital water, updated procedures for the appropriate use of sterile and non-sterile water, coupled with surveillance constitute the cornerstones of prevention of these infections...|$|R
40|$|Determining {{the role}} of weather in <b>waterborne</b> <b>infections</b> is a {{priority}} public health research issue as climate change is predicted to increase the frequency of extreme precipitation and temperature events. To document the current knowledge on this topic, we performed a literature review of analytical research studies that have combined epidemiological and meteorological data in order to analyze associations between extreme precipitation or temperature and waterborne disease. A search of the databases Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS and Web of Science was conducted, using search terms related to <b>waterborne</b> <b>infections</b> and precipitation or temperature. Results were limited to studies published in English between January 2001 and December 2013. Twenty-four articles were included in this review, predominantly from Asia and North-America. Four articles used waterborne outbreaks as study units, while the remaining articles used {{number of cases of}} <b>waterborne</b> <b>infections.</b> Results presented in the different articles were heterogeneous. Although most of the studies identified a positive association between increased precipitation or temperature and infection, there were several in which this association was not evidenced. A number of articles also identified an association between decreased precipitation and infections. This highlights the complex relationship between precipitation or temperature driven transmission and waterborne disease. We encourage researchers to conduct studies examining potential effect modifiers, such as the specific type of microorganism, geographical region, season, type of water supply, water source or water treatment, in order to assess how they modulate the relationship between heavy rain events or temperature and waterborne disease. Addressing these gaps is of primary importance in order to identify the areas where action is needed to minimize negative impact of climate change on health in the future. © 2015 Guzman Herrador et al.; licensee BioMed Central...|$|R

40|$|Background: Recent public {{attention}} on drinking water supplies {{in the aftermath}} of <b>waterborne</b> <b>infection</b> outbreaks in Walkerton and North Battleford raises questions about safety. We analyzed information on waterborne outbreaks occurring between 1974 and 2001 in order to identify apparent trends, review the current status of monitoring and reporting, and {{gain a better understanding of}} the impact of drinking water quality on public health and disease burden. Methods: Data from outbreak investigations, published and unpublished, were categorized by the type of drinking water provider and were assessed to be definitely, probably or possibly waterborne in nature. Results: The final data set consisted of 288 outbreaks of disease linked to a drinking water source. There were 99 outbreaks in public water systems, 138 outbreaks in semi-public systems and 51 outbreaks in private systems. The main known causative agents of waterborne disease outbreaks were (in descending frequency of occurrence) Giardia, Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium, Norwalk-like viruses, Salmonella and hepatitis A virus...|$|E
40|$|The {{hospital}} {{water system}} may constitute a reservoir for microorganisms, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Legionella pneumophila, Acinetobacter spp., mycetes, non-tubercular mycobacteria, and so on, {{which can cause}} healthcare-associated infections. Indeed, it has been revealed that 20 - 50 % of cases of nosocomial colonization/infection due to P. aeruginosa are sustained by <b>waterborne</b> strains. <b>Waterborne</b> <b>infections</b> can be spread not only through the ingestion of contaminated water but also by contact with or the inhalation of aerosols. Immunocompromised patients are particularly susceptible to infection by such microorganisms, {{many of which are}} multi-resistant to antibiotics. Healthcare effects range from colonization of the airways and urinary tracts to bacteraemia and disseminated infections. In 2011, the WHO issued guidelines on the quality of water for human consumption, including hospital water supplies. In risk assessment and management, these guidelines adopt criteria centred on preventive measures rather than remedial action alone. The guidelines recommend the adoption of a Water Safety Plan for water-risk management.

40|$|We {{calculated}} {{rates of}} foodborne and <b>waterborne</b> <b>infections</b> {{reported to the}} health department in Victoria, Australia, during 2000 – 2009 for elderly residents of longterm care facilities (LTCFs) and the community. We used negative binomial regression to estimate incidence rate ratios, adjusting for age, sex, and reporting period. We analyzed 8, 277 infections in elderly persons. Rates of campylobacteriosis, legionellosis, listeriosis, toxigenic Escherichia coli infections, and shigellosis were higher in community residents, and rates of Salmonella infection were higher in LTCF residents. Each year, 61. 7 Campylobacter infections were reported per 100, 000 LTCF residents, compared with 97. 6 per 100, 000 community residents. LTCF residents were at higher risk for S. enterica serotype Typhimurium associated with outbreaks. Rates of foodborne infections (except salmonellosis) were similar to or lower for LTCF residents than for community residents. These fi ndings may indicate that food preparation practices in LTCFs are safer than those used by elderly persons in the community. Infectious disease incidence varies with age, and elderly persons are considered more vulnerable than younger persons to foodborne and <b>waterborne</b> <b>infections</b> (1, 2). In many countries, elderly persons unable to care for themselves live in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) where they receive assistance with meals, daily living, and health care (3).

40|$|To prevent {{waterborne}} disease outbreaks, mitigation of faecal contamination {{of drinking water}} sources and sufficient treatment of water at the drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) are required. The {{aim of this study}} was to combine and apply several tools to investigate the raw water quality and determine the risk for <b>waterborne</b> <b>infections</b> in a drinking water source for the cities of Mölndal and Gothenburg in Sweden, Lake Rådasjön. To identify the major contamination sources around the lake and their contribution to the faecal contamination at the water intakes of DWTPs, monitoring of faecal indicators and pathogens was combined with microbial source tracking and water quality modelling. The microbial source tracking was performed to determine the human or ruminant origin of faecal contamination using host-specific Bacteroidales genetic markers. The decay of these genetic markers in relation to the decay of traditional faecal indicators in water environment was investigated in outdoor microcosm trials performed in different seasons. Using measured concentrations of Bacteroidales genetic markers the pathogen (norovirus and Cryptosporidium) concentrations in faecal contamination sources around the lake were estimated for endemic and epidemic conditions. Afterwards, the fate and transport of faecal indicators and pathogens within the lake were simulated using a three-dimensional coupled hydrodynamic and microbiological model, which was calibrated based on the decay data from the microcosm trials. Based on the obtained results a microbial risk assessment of a conventional DWTP was conducted using two different approaches – optimal disinfection practices (ODP) and quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA). The results showed that the on-site sewers were the source that contributed the most to the pathogen concentrations at the water intakes under both endemic and epidemic conditions. The results from both the ODP and QMRA risk assessments indicated that the barrier efficiency against Cryptosporidium and possibly viruses may be too low at a conventional DWTP. This study demonstrated how different approaches and tools can be applied to evaluate the risks for <b>waterborne</b> <b>infections</b> and prioritise mitigation measures related to faecal contamination of surface drinking water sources...|$|R

Rainbow trout {{were exposed to}} 8 × 107 CFU/ml of Y. ruckeri by bath for 6 hr, and mortality was then monitored for 22 days post-infection (dpi). Organs were sampled at 3 dpi and also from moribund fish showing signs of severe systemic infection such as bleeding, exophthalmia or erratic swimming behaviour. Y. ruckeri was observed in the meninges and diencephalon of the brain, and lamina propria of olfactory organ at 3 dpi. At 12 dpi, Y. ruckeri had spread throughout the brain including cranial connective tissues and ventricles and the infection was associated with haemorrhages and an infiltration with leucocytes. Y. ruckeri infection and associated with leucocyte infiltration were observed at 13 dpi.

The putative primary structure of the polypeptide deduced from the cDNA sequence contained 612 aa, which possessed a T-box DNA binding domain. Phylogenetic study and gene synteny revealed it is a homologue to mammalian T-bet. Quantitative PCR analysis of different tissues in healthy fish showed that salmon T-bet gene was highly expressed in spleen, followed by head kidney, and was expressed in intestine, skin, and liver at lower levels.

Of 5800 samples collected and analyzed from November 1994 to June 1998, 3700 were associated with outbreaks. A total of 676 outbreaks were analyzed, and viruses were found in 67 %. Caliciviruses, usually Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs), were found in 407 (89 %) of 455 outbreaks, while Sapporo-like viruses were identi®ed in nine outbreaks, including six that were suspected to include foodborne transmission.

40|$|Chemical risk {{assessments}} often focus on measuring exposure as if individuals were subject only to exogenous environmental sources of risk.

40|$|Edwardsiella ictaluri is {{the leading}} cause of {{mortality}} in channel catfish culture, but little is known about its pathogenesis. The use of signature-tagged mutagenesis in a <b>waterborne</b> <b>infection</b> model resulted in the identification of 50 mutants that were unable to infect/survive in catfish. Nineteen had minitransposon insertions in miscellaneous genes in the chromosome, 10 were in genes that matched to hypothetical proteins, and 13 were in genes that had no significant matches in the NCBI databases. Eight insertions were in genes encoding proteins associated with virulence in other pathogens, including three in genes involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, three in genes involved in type III secretion systems (TTSS), and two in genes involved in urease activity. With the use of a sequence from a lambda clone carrying several TTSS genes, Blastn analysis of the partially completed E. ictaluri genome identified a 26, 135 -bp pathogenicity island containing 33 genes of a TTSS with similarity to the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 class of TTSS. The characterization of a TTSS apparatus mutant indicated that it retained its ability to invade catfish cell lines and macrophages but was defective in intracellular replication.

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 The {{ability of}} Flexibacter columnaris to attach to fish cells was studied. Four {{of the five}} {{bacterial}} strains tested were able to adhere to fish cells derived from four different fish species. The attachment of these strains in vitro required magnesium but was not affected by increasing the incubation temperature from 16 to 22 °C. Cells attached in higher numbers when {{they were at the}} end of the log phase of the growth cycle. The fifth strain, K 4 m, had an atypical colony morphology and was unable to attach to the four fish cell lines used under any of the assay conditions tested. The four strains that were able to adhere to fish cells in vitro were also able to kill fish when infected by waterborne exposure. Strain K 4 m was unable to kill fish infected by waterborne exposure, but did cause infection when fish were injected intraperitoneally with a culture of this strain. This means that the ability to infect and kill fish by natural or <b>waterborne</b> <b>infection</b> is closely related to the ability of the bacterial cells to attach to fish cells.

40|$|The faecal {{contamination}} {{of drinking water}} sources can lead to waterborne disease outbreaks. To estimate a potential risk for <b>waterborne</b> <b>infections</b> caused by faecal {{contamination of}} drinking water sources, knowledge of the pathogen concentrations in raw water is required. We suggest a novel approach to estimate pathogen concentrations in a drinking water source by using microbial source tracking data and fate and transport modelling. First, the pathogen (norovirus, Cryptosporidium, Escherichia coli O 157 /H 7) concentrations in faecal contamination sources around the drinking water source Lake Rådasjön in Sweden were estimated for endemic and epidemic conditions using measured concentrations of faecal indicators (E. coli and Bacteroidales genetic markers). Afterwards, the fate and transport of pathogens within the lake were simulated using a three-dimensional coupled hydrodynamic and microbiological model. This approach provided information on the contribution from different contamination sources to the pathogen concentrations at the water intake of a drinking water treatment plant. This approach addresses the limitations of monitoring and provides data for quantitative microbial risk assessment(QMRA) and risk management {{in the context of}} faecal contamination of surface drinking water sources...|$|R
40|$|Unless special {{measures}} are taken, community water supplies {{are likely to}} contain enteric viruses which may lead to sporadic cases, or even epidemics, of such diseases as infectious hepatitis or poliomyelitis. After a general discussion of <b>waterborne</b> viral <b>infections,</b> {{in which it is}} pointed out that subclinical infections may considerably outnumber clinical cases, the author proposes a method for the concentration and detection of enteric viruses in water by means of membrane filtration and growth on monkey-kidney-cell or other tissue cultures...|$|R

High HEV seroprevalences {{can be found}} in European pig populations. The aims of this study were to obtain prevalence data on HEV infection in swine in Belgium and to phylogenetically compare Belgian human HEV sequences with those obtained from swine. An ELISA screening prevalence of 73 % (95 % CI 68. 8 – 77. 5) was determined in Belgian pigs and a part of the results were re-evaluated by Western blot (WB). A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed and scenarios varying the ELISA specificity relative to WB were analysed. The seroprevalences estimated by the different scenarios ranged between 69 and 81 % and are in agreement with the high exposure of the European pig population to HEV. Pig HEV sequences were genetically compared to those detected in humans in Belgium and a predominance of genotype 3 subtype f was shown in both swine and humans. The high HEV seroprevalence in swine and the close phylogenetic relationships between pig and human HEV sequences further support the risk for zoonotic {{transmission of}} HEV between humans and pigs...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{factors of}} {{resistance}} and predisposition to viral diseases explain {{a significant part}} of the clinical variability observed within host populations. Predisposition to viral diseases has been associated to MHC haplotypes and T cell immunity, but a growing repertoire of innate/intrinsic factors are implicated in the genetic determinism of the host susceptibility to viruses. In a long-term study of the genetics of host resistance to fish rhabdoviruses, we produced a collection of double-haploid rainbow trout clones showing a wide range of susceptibility to Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus (VHSV) <b>waterborne</b> <b>infection.</b> The susceptibility of fibroblastic cell lines derived from these clonal fish was fully consistent with the susceptibility of the parental fish clones. The mechanisms determining the host resistance therefore did not associate with specific host immunity, but rather with innate or intrinsic factors. One cell line was resistant to rhabdovirus infection due to the combination of an early interferon IFN induction - that was not observed in the susceptible cells - and of yet unknown factors that hamper the first steps of the viral cycle. The implication of IFN was well consistent with the wide range of resistance of this genetic background to VSHV and IHNV, to the birnavirus IPNV and the orthomyxovirus ISAV. Another cell line was even more refractory to the VHSV infection through different antiviral mechanisms. This collection of clonal fish and isogenic cell lines provides an interesting model to analyze the relative contribution of antiviral pathways to the resistance to different viruses...|$|E
40|$|In a {{two year}} study {{carried out by}} 16 public health {{laboratories}} in England and Wales 62, 421 patients with presumed infective diarrhoea were investigated. Cryptosporidium infection was identified in 2 % (1295), ranging from 0. 5 % to 3. 9 % among laboratories. The positivity rate for cryptosporidium was highest in 1 - 4 year olds, and in children cryptosporidium was the second commonest pathogen after campylobacter. Illness was usually limited to abdominal cramps and watery diarrhoea with six motions/ 24 hours at worst and lasting seven days. Fewer than half the patients reported fever or vomiting. More severe illness with fever, abdominal cramps, vomiting, and watery diarrhoea of frequency greater than five motions in 24 hours was reported by only a tenth of cases but with a significantly increased prevalence in young adult males. One hundred and fifty five patients (12 %) probably acquired their infection abroad; 102 (9 %) of patients who acquired their infection at home reported drinking raw milk in the month before onset, and 253 (22 %) reported close contact with farm animals. Most laboratories experienced sudden infrequent increases in incidence in the community, only {{one of which was}} attributed to a recognised outbreak, which occurred in a nursery. Cryptosporidium should be routinely sought by laboratories investigating acute infectious diarrhoea, especially in children; up to a quarter of cases may be directly zoonotic, and the remainder may be due to person to person spread and <b>waterborne</b> <b>infection...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of human diseases associated with microbial contaminated water are infectious {{in nature and}} the associated pathogen includes bacteria, fungi, viruses and protozoa. Water contaminated with bacteria can cause a number of food-borne and water-borne diseases. The waterborne transmission is highly effective means of spreading infectious agents to {{a large portion of}} population; this includes water and milk too. <b>Waterborne</b> <b>infections</b> are recognized as resulting either from ingestion of contaminated water or ice, food items, which have, came into contact with microbial contaminated water (occurring through bathing and recreational activities) etc. The detection of E. coli in food and water is normally carried out by culturing methods, which normally take 3 - 6 days, These methods are complicated and time-consuming in spite of their correctness, and cannot easily meet inspection demands on E. coli. Hence, an establishment of rapid detection methods for E. coli is strongly required. We have developed highly sensitive and cost effective solid sate sensors prepared from vacuum evaporated thin films of nanocomposite copolymer detection of presence of E. coli vapors in the air within 20 seconds. These sensors operate at room temperature. The preparation, optical, electrical, and structural characterization and behavioral acceptance test on the microorganism sensing properties of these sensors are reported here...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEnteric viruses are {{commonly}} present in environmental waters {{and represent the}} major cause of <b>waterborne</b> <b>infections</b> and outbreaks. Since traditional wastewater treatments fail to remove enteric viruses in the water purification process, they are released daily into environmental waters. Monolithic supports have enabled chromatography to enter the field of virology. They have been successfully used in virus purification and concentration. In this work quaternary amine (QA) methacrylate monoliths were exploited to remove enteric viruses from wastewater treatment plant effluent. Expectedly, chromatographic processing of such a complex medium was troublesome, even for monoliths, characterized by extremely large pore dimensions. This problem was solved by introducing a pre-step chromatography using hydroxyl (OH) methacrylate monoliths. This way, molecules, that would hinder virus binding to the anion-exchanger monolith, were removed. As a result, the OH pre-column reduced backpressure increase on the subsequent anion-exchanger column, and increased both QA column binding capacity and life time. Wastewater effluent samples were successfully purified from five waterborne enteric viruses (rotavirus, norovirus genogroup I and II, astrovirus, sapovirus), below the detection limit of RT-qPCR. The breakthrough of the rotavirus binding capacity was not reached for concentrations that significantly exceeded those expected in effluent waters. The obtained results confirm that methacrylate monoliths can be a valuable tool for simultaneous removal of different waterborne viruses from contaminated water sources...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis E virus, HEV, is a {{frequent}} causative agent behind, especially <b>waterborne,</b> <b>infections</b> in developing countries such as India. However, during the last years the number of non-travel-associated infections in industrialised countries, for example US, Germany and Sweden, has increased. The symptoms vary from mild with nausea to icterus and it can even be lethal. There are four different genotypes of HEV and many studies consider HEV infection to be a zoonosis. Scientists have by using phylogenetic analyses found great genetic similarity between strains isolated from humans, pigs and food, such as pork and liver, especially among viruses belonging to genotype 3. Genotype 3 {{has been shown to}} be involved in outbreaks linked to consumption of poor cooked meat. Studies have shown cross species infection, where pigs have been infected with human HEV strains and nonhuman apes infected with swine HEV strains. The prevalence of antibodies among people in many industrialized countries is higher than earlier assumed. In addition to this, the levels of anti-HEV from swine and anti-HEV from humans, that means antibodies against both virus strains from animals and humans, among blood donators in USA are the same and veterinarians working with swine have higher levels of both. Humans and animals can be infected and secrete virus without having any symptoms and thus act as reservoirs for the virus...|$|R
