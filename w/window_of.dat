5|$|Although Mirza, Microcebus, and Allocebus form a clade within Cheirogaleidae, {{the three}} {{lineages}} {{are thought to}} have diverged during a narrow <b>window</b> <b>of</b> time, so the relationships within this clade are difficult to determine and may change with further research. All three {{are thought to have}} diverged at least 20mya (million years ago), although another estimate using mtDNA places the divergence between Mirza and Microcebus at 24.2mya. Divergence between the two recognized species of giant mouse lemur is estimated at 2.1mya.|$|E

5|$|At 5:30 am on April 19, {{dynamite}} {{was thrown}} through a front <b>window</b> <b>of</b> Z.

Although the explosion almost destroyed the house, Looby and his wife, who were asleep in a back bedroom, were not injured. More than 140 windows in a nearby dormitory were broken by the blast.|$|E
5|$|Emperor {{penguins}} are serially monogamous. They {{have only}} one mate each year, and stay faithful to that mate. However, fidelity between years is only about 15%. The narrow <b>window</b> <b>of</b> opportunity available for mating {{appears to be an}} influence, as there is a priority to mate and breed which often precludes waiting for the appearance of the previous year's partner.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1092 and {{completed}} in the early 15th century, Carlisle Cathedral is one of England’s smallest cathedrals since the demolition of its nave by the Scottish Presbyterian Army in 1649. Its most significant feature is its nine-light Flowing Decorated east <b>window</b> <b>of</b> 1322, still containing medieval glass in its upper sections, forming a “glorious termination to the choir” and regarded by many as having the finest tracery in England.|$|E

6000|$|... 'And for the house, he made <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> narrow lights' (1 Kings 6:4).

These <b>windows</b> were <b>of</b> several sizes, but all narrow, narrow without, but wide within; {{they also were}} finely wrought, and beautified with goodly stones (Isa 54:12).|$|R
50|$|The term {{cathedral glass}} is {{sometimes}} applied erroneously to the <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> cathedrals {{as an alternative}} to the term stained glass. Stained glass is the material and the art form <b>of</b> making coloured <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> elaborate or pictorial design.|$|R
5|$|In {{the eastern}} {{corner of the}} south aisle {{of the church is}} a {{monument}} of the Baber family, who formerly had large possessions in the parish.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that for an icy satellite the size of Mimas or Enceladus to enter an 'excited state' of tidal heating and convection, it would need to enter an orbital resonance before it lost too much of its primordial internal heat. Because Mimas, being smaller, would cool more rapidly than Enceladus, its <b>window</b> <b>of</b> opportunity for initiating orbital resonance-driven convection would have been considerably shorter.|$|E

As the police and neighbors gather, Kim leads them to believe that Jim and Edward killed each other.|$|E

5|$|King George V died on 20 January 1936, and Edward {{ascended the}} throne as King Edward VIII.

He became the first monarch of the British Empire to fly in an aircraft when he flew from Sandringham to London for his Accession Council.|$|E
5|$|Little of {{the early}} stained glass remains. In the west <b>window</b> <b>of</b> St John's Chapel, for instance, the medieval glass barely survived the {{destruction}} (said to {{have been caused by}} Oliver Cromwell's men). Most of the higher portions went untouched, but others were severely damaged. In some cases the windows were impossible to repair, and clear glass was eventually introduced to replace the missing scenes. The Victorian stained-glass windows were created by some of the finest studios of that period.|$|E
5|$|St. Rynagh's Church {{houses a}} {{work by the}} {{well-known}} German sculptor, Imogen Stuart, called The Madonna and Child, a mandorla carved in 1974.

5|$|The current {{building}} {{was constructed in}} the 15th century {{on the site of}} a wooden building dating from the 12th century. In the 16th century a new facade was added to the original building. It is possible that the stonework and <b>window</b> <b>of</b> the front wall were removed from the abbot's lodgings behind the great kitchen of the Abbey as similar features can be identified in a 1712 engraving, and it is known that the {{building was}} ruined and without its front wall by 1723.|$|E
5|$|The gatehouse's eastwards-facing tower {{contains}} the chapel, an unusual arrangement {{driven by a}} lack of space, with a recently restored east <b>window</b> <b>of</b> reset 15th-century glass designed by Nicola Hopwood, which illuminates the priest's seat, or sedile. The 15th-century window frame itself replaced an even taller, earlier 13th-century window. The chapel's west window is modern, and commemorates British servicemen who died between 1936–76 in radar development. The altar itself is particularly old, possibly pre-dating the castle.|$|E
