5|$|From 2006 to 2013, XV was {{developed}} by what was then Square Enix 1st Production Department. In the wake of extensive business restructuring in 2013, development of XV transferred to the newly formed Business Division 2, headed by Tabata and incorporating the core Final Fantasy development team. Along with bringing in staff members from other sections of the company, they also recruited help from other development studios: HexaDrive {{was brought in to}} help with engineering the game, XPEC Entertainment helped <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> for the later sections of the game, Shanghai company Plusmile helped <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> of buildings, licensed middleware from Umbra was used to boost the game's graphics, while Streamline Studios was brought in to help with technical development. It was initially supposed, after an announcement in 2015, that Avalanche Studios was brought on board to help create the game's airship mechanics. In the event, Avalanche and Square Enix did not directly collaborate: instead, Avalanche showed them their level of detail development methods, and Square Enix's internal team created the airship mechanics using that information.|$|E

5|$|It transpired {{that the}} only {{manufacturer}} able to supply suitable tiles was Royal Doulton, although they were {{unable or unwilling to}} replicate DeMorgan's designs, and they were duly commissioned to manufacture the 24 tiles, delivered in May 1908. Mary Watts was unhappy <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> of the tiles, which were significantly different in colour and appearance from DeMorgan's original tiles, and they were installed without ceremony on 21 August 1908, immediately below DeMorgan's original row of tiles.|$|E
5|$|Like all {{industrial}} processes, {{injection moulding}} can produce flawed parts. In {{the field of}} injection moulding, troubleshooting is often performed by examining defective parts for specific defects and addressing these defects <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> of the mould or {{the characteristics of the}} process itself. Trials are often performed before full production runs in an effort to predict defects and determine the appropriate specifications to use in the injection process.|$|E

5|$|Wright {{designed}} the Taliesin structure {{two years after}} leaving his first wife and home in Oak Park, Illinois with a mistress, Mamah Borthwick. The design of the original building was consistent <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> principles of the Prairie School, emulating the flatness of the plains and the natural limestone outcroppings of Wisconsin's Driftless Area. The structure (which included an agricultural and studio wing) was completed in 1911.|$|E
5|$|A life-size {{sculpture}} of the {{coat of arms}} was created by artist and former Times Union political cartoonist Hy Rosen in 1986. Rosen took some liberty <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>design,</b> such as adding farm tools to emphasize the city's agricultural and trading history, as well as adding previously undocumented detail; the left supporter also takes on more of the look of an explorer (e.g., Henry Hudson) than a farmer. The statue was commissioned by Norstar Bank President Peter D. Kiernan {{as part of the}} park across Broadway from the then-newly renovated Union Station, which Norstar used as its headquarters until buyer Bank of America moved its employees out of the building in 2010. The statue still stands in Tricentennial Park on Broadway.|$|E

China regards the project as monumental {{as well as a}} success socially and economically, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> of state-of-the-art large turbines, and a move toward limiting greenhouse gas emissions. However, the dam flooded archaeological and cultural sites and displaced some 1.3million people, and is causing significant ecological changes, including an increased risk of landslides. The dam has been controversial both domestically and abroad.|$|E
5|$|Bruce's {{early work}} {{involved}} advising clients and rebuilding existing houses, rather than designing new buildings from scratch. Panmure House and Leslie House (seat of the Earl of Rothes) had been projects of the king's master mason John Mylne. At Panmure, although Bruce has been credited <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> in the past, the works were overseen by Alexander Nisbet, although Bruce did design the gates and gate piers. At Leslie, Bruce oversaw the works after Mylne's death, and probably {{made his own}} amendments. Panmure was demolished in the 1950s, and {{only a small part}} of Leslie House remains standing, following a fire in the 18th century. Bruce later advised the Duke of Queensberry regarding his plans for Drumlanrig Castle.|$|E
5|$|Château Gaillard {{consists}} of three baileys—an inner, a middle, and an outer with the main entrance to the castle—and a keep, also called a donjon, in the inner-bailey. The baileys, which were separated by rock-cut ditches, housed the castle's stables, workshops, and storage facilities. It is common for extant castles {{to be the result}} of several phases of construction, and were adapted and added to over the period of their use; however Château Gaillard essentially is the result of one period of building. The division into three wards bears similarities <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> of Château de Chinon, built by HenryII in the mid-12thcentury on a promontory overlooking a town.|$|E

And the network configuration is built <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>designed</b> mobile sensor nodes. The basic tests are conducted <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>designed</b> system. And <b>the</b> results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which satisfies the requirements of mobile sensor network, that is, mobilization, data collection, data processing and data transportation. © 2009 IEEE.

5|$|Except for {{the corner}} houses, {{the houses were}} built in pairs, each sharing a porch with its neighbour. For many of the smaller fourth- and fifth-class houses, the doors were aligned {{at right angles to}} the façade of the house, so as not to open {{directly}} adjacently to their neighbours. All houses were designed with at least one parlour and with the kitchen, scullery, and toilet in separate rooms {{at the rear of the}} house; the first-class houses also had toilets upstairs. In line <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> principles of the time, the downstairs toilets were accessible only from the back gardens, and the houses were not fitted with separate bathrooms; baths were taken in a moveable bath located in the kitchen.|$|E
5|$|From its {{establishment}} in 1967 to its abolition in 1992, the Milton Keynes Development Corporation created {{by far the}} largest and most ambitious of the British new towns: indeed its objective was to build a new city of 250,000 people. Many of Britain's most acclaimed building and landscape architects contributed to what was to be a show-piece of British design. Unlike previous new towns, Milton Keynes has a preponderance of privately funded development but these developments were subject to an exacting design brief in line <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>design</b> principles laid out in The Plan for Milton Keynes.|$|E

John Carmack added {{the idea of a}} genius child protagonist saving the world, and Hall quickly created a short summary for the game: a dramatic introduction about eight-year-old genius Billy Blaze, defending the Earth with his spaceship. When he read out the summary in an over-dramatic voice to the group, they laughed and applauded, and the group agreed to begin work on Commander Keen in the Invasion of the Vorticons.|$|E
