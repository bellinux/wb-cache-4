500|$|Eventually, {{the band}} left their {{independent}} record label Lookout! Records on friendly terms, and signed to Reprise. Signing {{to a major}} label caused many of the band's original fans from the independent music club 924 Gilman Street to regard Green Day as sell-outs. The club has banned Green Day from entering since the major label signing. Reflecting back on the period, lead vocalist Billie Joe Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, [...] "I couldn't {{go back to the}} punk scene, <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure [...] The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward." ...|$|E
500|$|Kerplunks {{underground}} success led to {{a number}} of major record labels being interested in signing Green Day, and the band eventually left Lookout! and signed to Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. The group was impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo [...] "was the only person we could really talk to and connect with". Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, [...] "I couldn't go back to the punk scene, <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward." [...] After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major label debut, Dookie.|$|E
500|$|A Bollywood {{version of}} the song was done by Indian music {{producer}} duo Salim and Sulaiman Merchant. The remix was released on DesiHits.com, a website for South Asian music and entertainment news. The Merchants were discussing music projects with Anjula Acharia-Bath of DesiHits.com, {{when they came to}} learn that Gaga, who did not have much reach within the Indian diaspora, was interested in a Bollywood remix for [...] "Born This Way". The Merchants were contacted by Gaga's manager, Troy Carter, and the remix was finalized. Sulaiman explained that they received Gaga's raw vocals from [...] "Born This Way", and using it as a base, they designed the remix. [...] "We sent her a rough cut of our composition for initial feedback on <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> giving it the right groove. She loved it and that's how we went about it," [...] he added. The Merchants used a number of Indian musical instruments like the dugi, sitar by Sunil Das, and the dhol and dholak in the chorus. Salim said that he sang a little bit of alaap to give the remix a Sufi touch, [...] "as that's the kind of music we do and it was also about adding our signature." [...] Gaga's management team were satisfied with their remix and wanted them to do another remix of her next song, [...] "Judas". The Bollywood remixes were a part of the Indian track list of Born This Way.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the year}} 987, {{as the result}} of a {{consultation}} with his boyars, Vladimir sent envoys to study the religions of the various neighboring nations whose representatives had been urging him to embrace their respective faiths. Of the Muslim Bulgarians of the Volga the envoys reported there is no joy among them; only sorrow and a great stench. In the gloomy churches of the Germans his emissaries saw no beauty; but at Hagia Sophia, where the full festival ritual of the Byzantine Church was set in motion to impress them, they found their ideal: [...] "We no longer knew <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in heaven or on earth," [...] they reported, [...] "nor such beauty, and we know not how to tell of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|An old Russian chronicle {{records that}} Prince Vladimir of Kiev (c. 1000) {{was unable to}} decide which faith to {{proclaim}} as his own and his people’s until his envoys reported from Constantinople that they had witnessed magnificent services there: [...] "We knew not <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in heaven or on earth," [...] they exclaimed, [...] "for on earth {{there is no such}} splendor or such beauty, and we are at a loss to describe it. We know only that God dwells there among men." [...] Intended to induce an awareness of the divine on Earth, the rituals of the Russian Orthodox Church are organized so as to engage all five senses. [...] The church ceremonial combines visual, audial, tactile, and olfactory phenomena to produce “the highest synthesis of heterogeneous artistic activities” all to be absorbed by both active and passive participants’ senses. [...] Pavel Florensky notes the comprehensive and captivatingly sensual nature of the aesthetic experiences offered through Russian Orthodox liturgy in his 1922 article “The Church Ritual as a Synthesis of the Arts.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The Labour Party came {{to power}} in 1997 with a {{manifesto}} saying, [...] "We will ensure greater protection for wildlife. We have advocated new measures to promote animal welfare, including a free vote in Parliament on whether hunting with hounds should be banned." [...] A new private member's bill, introduced by Michael Foster MP, received a second reading with 411 MPs voting in support, but failed due to lack of parliamentary time. The Burns Report in 2000 concluded that forms of fox hunting [...] "seriously compromise the welfare of the fox", but (in line with its remit) did not draw any conclusion on whether hunting should be banned or should continue. In a later debate in the House of Lords, the inquiry chairman, Lord Burns also stated that [...] "Naturally, people ask <b>whether</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> implying that hunting is cruel... The short {{answer to that question is}} no. There was not sufficient verifiable evidence or data safely to reach views about cruelty. It is a complex area." [...] Following the Burns inquiry, the Government introduced an 'options bill' which allowed each House of Parliament to choose between a ban, licensed hunting, and self-regulation. The House of Commons voted for a banning bill and the House of Lords for self-regulation. The 2001 general election was then called and the bill ran out of parliamentary time.|$|E
