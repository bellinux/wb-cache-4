5|$|Clearly, {{some sort}} of {{flexible}} bag was required to contain an explosive gel so {{that it did not}} matter how the bomb landed on the target. However, a flexible bag is hard to throw and trials had not been at all satisfactory. Discussions of the problem in Macrae's office were overheard by Gordon Norwood, a master printer who Macrae had recruited from his former magazine publishing employer, but he was not directly working on the weapon. Norwood suggested that what was needed was a frangible container and to the annoyance of the War Office store keeper he obtained a 150 W light bulb with which to demonstrate his point: a spherical glass flask inside a sock of woven wool is rigid when thrown, but on contact the glass breaks and the bomb deforms to the required shape. Experiments with glass flasks filled with cold porridge confirmed that this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> go. The grenade needed a delay for the thrower to get clear, so the woollen sock was covered in a sticky substance ensuring that the bomb stayed in place for a few seconds before detonating. Having covered the bomb in glue, a non-sticky handle was required. In the handle, a delay fuse was ignited by releasing a sprung lever so that a five second time delay starts as the grenade leaves the thrower's hand (just like the levers found on a conventional Mills bomb type hand grenade).|$|E
5|$|During the 1650s, Ashmole {{devoted a}} great deal of energy to the study of alchemy. In 1650, he {{published}} Fasciculus Chemicus under the anagrammatic pseudonym James Hasolle. This work was an English translation of two Latin alchemical works, one by Arthur Dee, the son of John Dee. In 1652, he published his most important alchemical work, Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum, an extensively annotated compilation of metaphysical poems in English. The book preserved and made available many works that had previously existed only in privately held manuscripts. A corrected edition using Ashmole's two errata sheets and the additional chapter seven of a piece by Thomas Charnock was published in 2011. There is little evidence that Ashmole conducted his own alchemical experiments. He {{appears to have been a}} collector of alchemical writings and a student of alchemy rather than an active practitioner, and refers to himself as a pupil of William Backhouse. His final alchemical publication <b>was</b> <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>to</b> Bliss in 1658, but thereafter his interest seems to wane in favour of his other pursuits. Ashmole promoted the use of therapeutic remedies drawing on both Galenic and Paracelsian principles, and his works attempt to merge the two schools. The Way to Bliss recommends ways to prevent illness: a balanced diet, moderate exercise and enough sleep. His works were avidly studied by other natural philosophers, such as Isaac Newton.|$|E

25|$|A fervent {{champion}} of the professional cricketer's rights, Shaw {{did a lot of}} work in support of his contemporaries.

In 1881, he led a strike of Notts professionals, demanding a formal contract of employment to guarantee an automatic benefit {{at the end of an}} agreed playing period. The high-handed Nottinghamshire committee thought this absolute anarchy and, apparently justified in its feeling that an amateur skipper <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> go, dropped every member of the offending faction from the side.

25|$|Part of the Contract with BRCW stipulated that, {{in view of}} its 42 {{years of}} {{experience}} in loco design, Sulzer were to accept full responsibility for the design and performance of the completed loco (6).

25|$|The {{second game}} was played on 9 November 2014. The opening was the solid Berlin {{variation}} of the Ruy Lopez where Carlsen played 4.d3 instead of the main line 4.0-0 Nxe4. Carlsen gave up the bishop pair to double Anand's c-pawns {{and the result of}} the opening was roughly equal. However, Anand's moves 16...Rd8, 18...Be6, and 19...Ng6 all contributed to making his position more unpleasant. In the heavy-piece endgame Carlsen's active pieces and outpost on e6 gave him a clear advantage. The game ended abruptly when Anand blundered with 34...h5??, allowing 35.Qb7 forcing instant resignation, because there is no good defense to 36.Rxg7+ Kh8 37.Rh7+ Kg8 38.Qg7 with checkmate. 34...Qd2 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> fight on but Anand's chances of a successful defence were slim.

25|$|The {{producers}} and director James Strong paid {{particular attention to}} the visual style of the reveal. Chibnall wanted to expose the murderer's identity visually and dynamically, not through dialogue in a static scene on a set. During a location site visit prior to filming, Chibnall, Strong, and Holmes walked from the house at Lavington Close to the house on St Andrews Drive. As they crossed a footbridge over the Land Yeo, Chibnall—struck by the scenery of the area—realised that a single, uncut point of view shot of DI Hardy walking through the Miller house, through the garden, and into the garden shed <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> reveal the killer's identity.

25|$|In My Life and Work Ford speaks (briefly) {{of racing}} {{in a rather}} dismissive tone, as {{something}} that is not at all a good measure of automobiles in general. He describes himself as someone who raced only because in the 1890s through 1910s, one had to race because prevailing ignorance held that racing <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> prove the worth of an automobile. Ford did not agree. But he was determined that as long as this was the definition of success (flawed though the definition was), then his cars would be the best that there were at racing. Throughout the book, he continually returns to ideals such as transportation, production efficiency, affordability, reliability, fuel efficiency, economic prosperity, and the automation of drudgery in farming and industry, but rarely mentions, and rather belittles, the idea of merely going fast from point A to point B.|$|E

In developing this program they borrowed from the traditions and practices of several other organizations. Edward Cave's Boy's Camp Book (1914) was consulted for {{the concept of a}} camp society that would perpetuate camp traditions. College fraternities were also influential for their concepts of brotherhood and rituals, and the idea of new members pledging themselves to the new organization. Inspired by Ernest Thompson Seton's previous Woodcraft Indians program, American Indian lore was used to make the organization interesting and appealing to youth. Other influences include the Brotherhood of Andrew and Phillip, a Presbyterian church youth group with which Goodman had been involved as a young man, and Freemasonry.|$|E

The film was called an [...] "anti-romantic opus of sexual obsession and cruelty" [...] by the Washington Post. His other work in period pieces such as Ken Russell's horror film The Lair of the White Worm (1988), award-winning Merchant-Ivory drama The Remains of the Day (1993) and (as Frédéric Chopin in) Impromptu (1991) went largely unnoticed. He later called this phase of his career [...] "hilarious," [...] referring to his early films as [...] "Europuddings, where {{you would have a}} French script, a Spanish director, and English actors.

500|$|Biographer Alan Paul {{notes that}} the band's members [...] "all profoundly felt the absence of their guiding light" [...] during the touring cycle for Eat a Peach. Dickey Betts had to {{convince}} the band members to tour, since all other members were reluctant. Despite rumors, the band did not replace Duane Allman, and simply toured as a five-piece. The Allman Brothers Band played 90 shows in 1972 {{in support of the}} record. [...] "We were playing for him and that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> be closest to him," [...] said Trucks. Allman and Oakley took turns introducing songs, which was traditionally Duane's role. Betts learned Duane's slide guitar parts, but put his own spin on it. Oakley had a downward spiral following Duane's death and was significantly inebriated for many shows on the tour. [...] "He wasn't playing like he used to — instead, he'd hit maybe every fifth note," [...] recalled Allman. Occasionally, the band would have bassist Joe Dan Petty, later of Grinderswitch, cover for Oakley for the show. After nearly a year of severe depression, Oakley was killed in a motorcycle accident not dissimilar from his friend's in November 1972.|$|E
500|$|As {{the high}} point of the royal progress, Catherine {{scheduled}} a meeting with her daughter Elisabeth, the third wife of Philip II of Spain. Catherine was so determined to make a magnificent impression on the Spanish court that she indulged in a spending spree that was extravagant even by her own standards. To help pay for the planned pageantry and entertainments, she borrowed 700,000 écus from the Gondi bank. Catherine had assumed she would also be meeting King Philip himself, but early in the tour, he sent word {{that he would not be}} attending. He was outraged that Catherine, whom he called [...] "Madame La Serpente", had received an embassy from the Sultan of Turkey. He also objected to her Edict of Amboise (1563), which had offered concessions to the Huguenots. In short, French religious policy disgusted him. [...] In his place he sent [...] "the severe and ferocious" [...] Duke of Alba, with orders to convince Catherine that persecuting, imprisoning, and torturing Huguenots <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> deal with heretics, not making treaties with them. In the event, Catherine left Alba befuddled by her darting mind. He found her far more interested in discussing marriage alliances and in showing him what the French court could lay on in the way of fabulous entertainments.|$|E

500|$|Coke's {{jurisprudence}} centres on {{the hierarchy}} of the judges, the monarch, and Parliament in making law. Coke argued that the judges of the common law were those most suited to making law, followed by Parliament, and that the monarch was bound to follow any legal rules. This principle was justified by the idea that a judge, through his professional training, internalised what political historian and theorist Alan Cromartie referred to as [...] "an infinity of wisdom", something that mere politicians or laypersons could not understand due to the complexity of the law. Coke's Commentary on Littleton has been interpreted as deliberately obtuse, with his aim being to write what Cromartie called [...] "a sort of anti-textbook, a work whose very form denied that legal knowledge could be organised. The original edition could not be used for reference purposes, as Coke had published it without an index... It is a book to be 'read in' and lived with, rather than consulted, a monument to the uselessness of merely written knowledge unless it is internalised in a trained professional mind". This theory – that judges were the natural arbiters of the law – is known as the [...] "appeal to reason", with [...] "reason" [...] referring not to rationality but the method and logic used by judges in upholding and striking down laws. Coke's position meant that certainty of the law and intellectual beauty <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> see if a law was just and correct, and that the system of law could eventually become sophisticated enough to be predictable.|$|E
500|$|During Hale's {{period as}} a {{barrister}} and judge, the general conclusion in England {{was that the}} repository {{of the law and}} conventional wisdom was not politics, as in Renaissance Europe, but the common law. This had been brought about thanks to Sir Edward Coke, who in his Institutes and practice as a judge advocated judge-made law. Coke asserted that judge-made law had the answer to any question asked of it, and as a result, [...] "a learned judge... was the natural arbiter of politics". This principle was known as the [...] "appeal to reason", with [...] "reason" [...] referring not to rationality but the method and logic used by judges in upholding and striking down laws. Coke's theory meant that certainty of the law and [...] "intellectual beauty" [...] <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> see if a law was just and correct, and that the system of law could eventually become sophisticated enough to be predictable. John Selden held similar beliefs, in that he thought that the common law was the proper law of England. However, he argued that this did not necessarily create judicial discretion to play with it, and that proper did not necessarily equal perfect. The law {{was nothing more than a}} contract made by the English people; this is known as the [...] "appeal to contract". Thomas Hobbes argued against Coke's theory. Along with Francis Bacon, he argued for natural law, created by the King's authority, not by any individual judge. Hobbes felt that there was no skill unique to lawyers, and that the law could be understood not through Coke's [...] "reason" [...] (the method used by lawyers) but through understanding the King's instructions. While the judges did make law, this was only valid because it was [...] "tacitly confirmed (because not disapproved) by the [...] ".|$|E
