5|$|While {{all but one}} justice {{personally}} rejected segregation, {{the judicial}} restraint faction questioned whether the Constitution gave the Court the power to order its end. The activist faction believed the Fourteenth Amendment did give the necessary authority and <b>were</b> <b>pushing</b> to go ahead. Warren, who held only a recess appointment, held his tongue until the Senate confirmed his appointment.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth and her {{advisers}} {{perceived the}} threat of a Catholic crusade against heretical England. Elizabeth therefore sought a Protestant solution that would not offend Catholics too greatly while addressing the desires of English Protestants; she would not tolerate the more radical Puritans though, who <b>were</b> <b>pushing</b> for far-reaching reforms. As a result, the parliament of 1559 started to legislate for a church based on the Protestant settlement of Edward VI, with the monarch as its head, but with many Catholic elements, such as vestments.|$|E
5|$|The early 1970s saw {{the rise}} of a new style of country music that was as rough and hard-edged, and which quickly became the most popular form of country. This was outlaw country, a style that {{included}} such mainstream stars as Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. Outlaw country was very rock-oriented, and had lyrics that focused on the criminal, especially drug and alcohol-related, antics of its performers, who grew their hair long, wore denim and leather and looked like hippies in contrast to the clean-cut country singers that <b>were</b> <b>pushing</b> the Nashville sound.|$|E

5|$|Moreau {{accompanied}} Desaix's Left Wing {{with the}} divisions of Delmas and Sainte-Suzanne (vice Beaupuy), Bourcier's Reserve and Saint-Cyr's cavalry and horse artillery which were ineffective in the mountains. Malsch was captured twice by the French and recaptured each {{time by the}} Austrians. Latour tried to force {{his way around the}} French left with cavalry but was checked by the mounted troops of the Reserve. Finding his horsemen outnumbered near Ötigheim, Latour used his artillery to keep the French cavalry at bay. In the Rhine plain the combat raged until 10 PM. In the evening the Austrians <b>were</b> <b>pushing</b> Desaix back when bad news from the left flank caused Charles to call a halt.|$|E
5|$|The German High Command did {{not want}} to exploit the victory at Sedan and Bulson until the German {{infantry}} divisions had caught up with the three Panzer divisions. To Guderian, this was madness and would throw away the victory at Sedan and allow the enemy time to recover and reorganise his still formidable armoured units. Guderian decided to push for the Channel, even if it meant ignoring the High Command and Hitler himself. Guderian ordered the 10th Panzer Division and Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment to hold the Sedan bridgehead, while the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions struck north west, towards the Channel. Now that they <b>were</b> <b>pushing</b> largely at an 'open door', the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions advanced into the undefended French rear with speed.|$|E
5|$|After a short halt {{to leave}} their baggage train behind and form a battle line the Persian army quickly {{advanced}} on the Byzantines, shooting arrows as they approached. The Byzantines responded in kind and then sallied forth to meet the oncoming enemy. On the Byzantine right Vitalius was quickly victorious, his heavy cavalry breaking through the Persian flank and pushing his opponents to the left behind their own main line. At this point, however, disaster threatened as many of Vitalius' troopers broke formation and headed towards the enemy camp, intending to loot it. Philippicus, however, saw {{what had happened and}} reacted quickly. He gave his distinctive helmet to one of his bodyguards, Theodore Ilibinus, and sent him to rally the cavalry on pain of punishment by the army commander himself. The ruse worked: the men recognized the helmet and returned to order just in time to stop the Persians, who had regrouped in the centre and <b>were</b> <b>pushing</b> the numerically inferior Byzantines back.|$|E

50|$|Thus the {{transition}} function takes a state, the next {{symbol of the}} input string, and the top symbol of the current stack and generates the next state, the stacks to <b>be</b> <b>pushed</b> and popped onto the embedded stack, the pushing and popping of the current stack, and the stacks to be considered the current stacks in the next transition. More conceptually, the embedded stack <b>is</b> <b>pushed</b> and popped, the current stack <b>is</b> optionally <b>pushed</b> back onto the embedded stack, and any other stacks one would like <b>are</b> <b>pushed</b> on top of that, with the last stack being the one read from in the next iteration. Therefore, stacks can <b>be</b> <b>pushed</b> both {{above and below the}} current stack.|$|R
5|$|In the 1995–96 close season, Goater {{received}} {{offers from}} Spanish club Osasuna and newly formed South Koreans Suwon Samsung Bluewings, but having recently married, {{he decided to}} stay in England. Shortly after, he moved to Bristol City for a fee of £175,000. Goater's Bristol City debut came against Gillingham. Goater scored, but Bristol City lost 3–2. City finished the season in fifth, qualifying for the playoffs, but lost to Brentford. The following season Bristol City <b>were</b> <b>pushing</b> for promotion into the First Division, and Goater scored regularly, eventually being named in the PFA Team of the Year for the division. In a little under two years with Bristol City, he scored 45 goals in 81 appearances. On 26 March 1998, transfer deadline day, Goater signed for Manchester City, who paid Bristol City £400,000 for his services.|$|E
5|$|In the 1925–26 season Millwall had 11 {{consecutive}} clean sheets, a Football League record, {{which they}} hold jointly with York City and Reading. Millwall {{became known as}} a hard-fighting Cup team and competed in various memorable matches, notably defeating three-time league winners and reigning champions Huddersfield Town 3–1 {{in the third round}} of the 1926–27 FA Cup. In the 1927–28 season Millwall won the Third Division South title and scored 87 goals at home in the league, an English record which still stands. Matches against Sunderland and Derby County saw packed crowds of 48,000-plus in the 1930s and 1940s. Their 1937 FA Cup run saw Millwall reach the semi-finals for the third time, and a fifth-round game against Derby still stands as Millwall's record attendance of 48,762. Millwall were the 11th best supported team in England in 1939, despite being in the Second Division. Millwall were one of the most financially wealthy clubs in England. The club proposed plans to improve the Den and signed international players. Winger Reg 'JR' Smith was capped twice, scoring two goals for England in 1938. The Lions <b>were</b> <b>pushing</b> for promotion to the First Division {{toward the end of the}} decade, but one week into the 1939–40 season, World War II broke out and Millwall were robbed of their aim.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of The Simpsons {{has made it}} a billion-dollar merchandising industry. The title family and supporting characters appear on everything from T-shirts to posters. The Simpsons {{has been used as}} a theme for special editions of well-known board games, including Clue, Scrabble, Monopoly, Operation, and The Game of Life, as well as the trivia games What Would Homer Do? and Simpsons Jeopardy!. Several card games such as trump cards and The Simpsons Trading Card Game have also been released. Many official or unofficial Simpsons books such as episode guides have been published. Many episodes of the show have been released on DVD and VHS over the years. When the first season DVD was released in 2001, it quickly became the best-selling television DVD in history, although it was later overtaken by the first season of Chappelle's Show. In particular, seasons one through seventeen have been released on DVD in the U.S. (Region 1), Europe (Region 2) and Australia/New Zealand/Latin America (Region 4). However, on April 19, 2015, Al Jean announced that the Season 17 DVD would be the last one ever produced, leaving the collection from Season 1 to 17, Season 20 (released out of schedule in 2009), with Seasons 18, 19, and 21 onwards unreleased. Jean also stated that the deleted scenes and commentary would try to be released to the Simpsons World app, and that they <b>were</b> <b>pushing</b> for Simpsons World to be expanded outside of the U.S. Two years later, however, on July 22, 2017, it was announced that Season 18 will be released on December 5, 2017 on DVD.|$|E
