2500|$|In {{engineering}} terms, [...] "four-wheel drive" [...] designates {{a vehicle}} with power delivered to four <b>wheel</b> <b>ends</b> spread over {{at least two}} axles. The term 4×4 (pronounced four by four) was in use to describe North American military four-wheel-drive vehicles {{as early as the}} 1940s, with the first number indicating the number of <b>wheel</b> <b>ends</b> on a vehicle and the second indicating the number of driven wheels.|$|R

25|$|Four-wheel drive, {{also called}} 4×4 ("four by four") or 4WD refers to {{type of a}} vehicle, {{specifically}} one with its drivetrain capable of providing torque to all <b>wheel</b> <b>ends</b> of a two-axled vehicle simultaneously. It may be full-time, or on-demand, and is typically linked via a transfer case which provides an additional output drive-shaft, along with additional gear ranges.|$|R

25|$|The Schooner {{was already}} {{out on the field}} before the Oklahoma {{sideline}} and the RUF/NEKS realized the kick had been disallowed. Worse, while moving across the wet, sloppy natural turf, the Schooner's wagon <b>wheels</b> <b>ended</b> up in a sticky, muddy patch of field and got stuck – {{right in front of the}} Washington bench. The Sooners were quickly penalized an additional 15 yards for unsportsmanlike conduct.|$|R
50|$|An S-cam {{is part of}} a {{braking system}} used in heavy {{vehicles}} such as trucks and wheeled machinery. It consists of a shaft, usually around 4 to 25 inches long, turned at one end by means of an air-powered brake booster and lever with an 'S' shaped cam at the <b>wheel</b> <b>end.</b> Turning the shaft pushes the brake shoes against the drum, producing friction.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{recommended}} practice provides guidelines for performing a complete brake reline {{on the front}} and rear axle of a bus with S-cam brakes. The practice includes the disassembly, cleaning, inspection and assembly. This {{recommended practice}} is to be used in conjunction with the manufacturer’s service manual. It is recommended that all components be replaced equally on both <b>wheel</b> <b>ends</b> of the axle. Failure to do so may affect braking performance...|$|R
25|$|Four-by-four (4×4) {{refers to}} the general class of vehicles. The first figure {{represents}} the total wheels (more precisely, axle ends), and the second, the number that are powered. Syntactically, 4×2 means a four-wheel vehicle that transmits engine torque to only two axle-ends: the front two in front-wheel drive or the rear two in rear-wheel drive. Alternatively, a 6×4 vehicle has three axles, two of which provide torque to two <b>wheel</b> <b>ends</b> each.|$|R
2500|$|KinI kinesins {{are named}} [...] "I" [...] because they present an {{internal}} motor domain, which uses ATP to promote depolymerization of tubulin polymer, the microtubule.

50|$|The {{simplest}} {{arrangement is}} to use long coupling rods, running horizontally. A large vertical movement at the <b>wheel</b> <b>end</b> gives rise to only a small horizontal movement at the jackshaft drive. For a diesel-mechanical locomotive this can be compensated for by horizontally compliant mounting of the transmission. The heavy engine is carried over the drive wheels for adhesion weight, but the relatively lightweight gearbox can be mounted at one end, beyond the coupled wheelbase. A final drive casing is also narrow enough to mount between the frames, allowing it to be mounted low down and level with the driving axles.|$|R

50|$|Every year, {{millions}} of small weights {{are attached to}} tires by automotive technicians balancing them. Traditionally, these weights have been made of lead; {{it is estimated that}} up to 500,000 pounds of lead, having fallen off car <b>wheels,</b> <b>ended</b> up in the environment. According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, worldwide these total more than 20,000 tonnes of lead annually, and therefore the use of less-toxic materials is encouraged. In Europe, lead weights have been banned since 2005; in the US, some states have also banned them. Alternatives are weights made of lead alloys that include zinc or copper, or weights that are altogether lead-free.|$|R

50|$|The Oshkosh TAK-4 (and TAK-4i) {{suspension}} {{is known}} as double wishbone independent suspension. This is an independent suspension design using two wishbone-shaped arms to locate the wheel. Each arm has two mounting points to the subframe and one joint at the knuckle, {{and in the case}} of TAK-4 independent suspension system these arms are of unequal length. The shock absorber and spring mount to the lower arm to control vertical movement. The double-wishbone suspension can also be referred to as ‘double A-arm,’ though the arms themselves can be A-shaped, L-shaped, or even a single bar linkage. The complete TAK-4 independent suspension system set-up also includes a subframe which contains the axle differential, half shafts, and <b>wheel</b> <b>ends</b> with steering attachments and brakes.|$|R
50|$|Since 1946, the {{two teams}} have played for the Wagon Wheel. The story goes that John R.

The horses pulled the wagon apart and one of the <b>wheels</b> <b>ended</b> up being buried. Buchtel would {{eventually}} settle on a site in Akron for Buchtel College. In 1902, while digging for a pipeline in Kent, the wheel was discovered and eventually came into the possession of Kent State dean of men Dr. Raymond Manchester. It was he who suggested in 1945 that the wheel be used as a trophy for the winner of the Kent State-Akron football game.|$|R
