5000|$|Silliman helped Blake {{with his}} first appointments. Before graduation, Isaac Tyson, an early mining developer, hired Blake to <b>work</b> <b>in</b> his Baltimore <b>Chrome</b> <b>Works,</b> the largest of their kind at the time. Thus, Robert V. Bruce in The Launching of Modern American Science (p. 144) credits Blake as [...] "the first college-trained chemist {{employed}} full-time in American industry." [...] Silliman later drew Blake away to help collect specimens for a mineral exhibit in New York, a path he would take {{many times over the}} ensuing decades. Benjamin Silliman's descriptions of the collection in an 1854 article in the Mining Magazine reveals Blake's travels from the gold belt in the southern Appalachians to up-state New York and New England. He was quickly becoming one of the most informed geologists in the country. One result was an honorary M.A. from Dartmouth in 1863.|$|R
