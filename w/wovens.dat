40|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} franchising in service provision, job creation and self employment opportunities is widely reported (Spinelli, Rosenberg, & Birley, 2004). In Australia, franchising currently contributes approximately $ 130 {{billion to the}} Australian economy representing 10 percent of national Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (Frazer, <b>Weaven</b> & Wright, 2008). Current research suggests {{that much of the}} future growth in franchising in many world economies will be attributable to the growth in multi-unit franchising arrangements (<b>Weaven</b> & Frazer, 2007). Multi-unit franchising (MUF) refers to an organisational arrangement in which franchisees are allowed to own more than one unit within the same franchise system. However, the existence of multi-unit franchising remains a curious anomaly. In particular, from an agency theoretic perspective, multi-unit franchising appears to represent a suboptimal alternative to traditional dyadic revenue sharing arrangements as it contradicts incentives rationales for franchising choice. However, the ubiquity and popularity of this organisational form has generated consistent debate regarding the relative merits of this growth strategy. Over the last 15 years there has been a myriad of research explaining and examining the area multi-unit franchising. Areas of particular interest have focused upon expansionary strategies, motivations and incentives, and differences between single-unit and multi-unit operations. Further research has explored the challenges which chain organisations encounter when employing a MUF framework (e. g., Bradach, 1995; Garg, Rasheed & Priem, 2005). However, whilst it is evident that growth has occurred throughout the franchising literature in relation to MUF, significant gaps still exist. For example, with the notable exception of Bradach (1995) limited research has explored the key factors (imperatives) essential for multi-unit franchising to succeed (i. e., operational performance), hence, ensuring sustainability of franchise systems. Moreover, previous research has not empirically examined franchise system performance within the context of different organisational forms of MUF that are distinguished by their influence upon the extent of direct franchisor control, rate of system expansion and management of system operations. Therefore, in order to empirically examine the influence of the four franchising imperatives (i. e., (1) unit growth, (2) uniformity, (3) local responsiveness and, (4) system wide adaptation) upon operational performance from a multi-unit perspective (i. e., (1) master franchising, (2) area development franchising, (3) area representative franchising and (4) incremental franchising), further exploration of the four franchising imperatives is warranted. This represents an important gap in the literature. The literature presents only one previous study (Garg et al., 2005) which has examined the four franchising imperatives proposed by Bradach (1995), however this study was limited as (1) only three of the four franchising imperatives were examined and (2) the study (Bradach, 1995) did not provide a comparison between the four different multi-unit franchising forms. As such, this research provides a comprehensive insight into the outcomes which were found to influence the four franchising imperatives upon operational performance across the four multi-unit franchising governance models.

40|$|The {{central place}} of the {{learning}} environment and the personal characteristics of the learner in influencing whether students adopt deep or surface approaches to learning is well evidenced in the literature (for example, Marton & Saljo, 1976; Biggs, 1987; Entwhistle, 2001; Ramsden, 2003). For this reason, tertiary educators are constantly seeking opportunities to provide best practice in their university classrooms. Yet simply motivating {{students to participate in}} class does not necessarily alter overall learning styles (Herington & <b>Weaven,</b> 2008). Although the term "learning style" is somewhat problematic (Richardson, 2000), previous research has shown that students' tendency towards a particular learning strategy affects their learning-related performance (Heikkila & Lonka, 2006). This suggests that the process of "unlearning" previous learning styles may pose a significant problem for academics if they hope to change their students’ learning processes from surface to deep learning. As a profession, teaching at the tertiary level obviously draws upon a formal knowledge base. An important step in the translation of the formal knowledge base to enlightened practice is to draw upon tertiary students' experiential and informal knowledge. What learning-related concepts, and misconceptions do they hold? What {{is going on in the}} students' minds?

Though the student body at La Trobe is no longer as politically active as it once was, the trend is similar at all Australian universities. Nonetheless, Socialist Alternative, and National Labor Students (NLS) are still very active, with the Union President typically coming from NLS. The La Trobe Student union has largely been run by NLS over previous years, in coalition with various independent groupings. The La Trobe University Students' Union is responsible for many Contact Student Services but its role has been considerably diminished as a consequence of Voluntary Student Unionism. There were previously three main student representative bodies on campus known as the La Trobe University Student Guild, The Student's Representative Council and the La Trobe Postgraduate Student's Association. The La Trobe University Student Representative Council, became the principal representative body on campus and a student advocacy group as well as student representatives for welfare, disability, women, queer, indigenous, environment, education and welfare and the Guild managed student services. In 2011 however, the Student's Representative Council, The La Trobe Postgraduate Students Association, The Students Guild and the University merged the three separate organisations into one body: The La Trobe Student Union.|$|R

Three-dimensional weaving with fibers connecting flat <b>wovens</b> together into a 3D system are being considered for both hard and soft ballistics.

Factors like fibrous composition, properties of constituent fibers, <b>wovens</b> structure parameters, mechanical properties of {{warp and weft}} yarns and finishing treatments that influenced the recovery capacity from crease/folding were investigated experimentally through several tests which revealed their importance in the process. The creasing of woven materials made from combed yarns type wool used for ready-clothes is an undesired deformation effect with temporary or permanent character, which {{is caused by a}} composed strain of bending and compression during utilization, processing or maintenance. It is manifested by the appearance of wrinkles, folds or stripes on the surface of <b>wovens</b> materials, thus diminishing their qualitative appearance and also their practical value. Creasing is the result of irreversible changes created through the reciprocal sliding of structural fiber components when exposed to a bending strain. Creasing is specific to oriented structures with high crystallinity (cellulosic fibers). The sliding appears because of hydrogen bond breaking which can, however, reform easy in other positions conferring a permanent character to creasing.

The Manufacturing Laboratory at NREL's Energy Systems Integration Facility (ESIF) focuses on developing methods and technologies that will assist manufacturers of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies, as well as other renewable energy technologies, to scale up their manufacturing capabilities to volumes that meet DOE and industry targets. Specifically, the manufacturing activity is currently focused on developing and validating quality control techniques to assist manufacturers of low temperature and high temperature fuel cells in the transition from low to high volume production methods for cells and stacks. Capabilities include initial proof-of-concept studies through prototype system development and in-line validation. Existing diagnostic capabilities address a wide range of materials, including polymer films, carbon and catalyst coatings, carbon fiber papers and <b>wovens,</b> and multi-layer assemblies of these materials, as well as ceramic-based materials in pre- or post-fired forms. Work leading to the development of non-contact, non-destructive techniques to measure critical dimensional and functional properties of fuel cell and other materials, and validation of those techniques on the continuous processing line. This work will be supported by materials provided by our partners. Looking forward, the equipment in the laboratory is set up to be modified and extended to provide processing capabilities such as coating, casting, and deposition of functional layers, as well as associated processes such as drying or curing.

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} {{is to develop a}} simulation-based algorithm, {{allowing}} the prediction of the effective mechanical properties of textiles {{on the basis of their}} microstructure and corresponding properties of fibers. This method can be used for optimization of the microstructure, in order to obtain a better stiffness or strength of the corresponding fiber material later on. An additional aspect of the thesis is that we want to take into account the microcontacts between fibers of the textile. One more aspect of the thesis is the accounting for the thickness of thin fibers in the textile. An introduction of an additional asymptotics with respect to a small parameter, the relation between the thickness and the representative length of the fibers, allows a reduction of local contact problems between fibers to 1 -dimensional problems, which reduces numerical computations significantly. A fiber composite material with periodic microstructure and multiple frictional microcontacts between fibers is studied. The textile is modeled by introducing small geometrical parameters: the periodicity of the microstructure and the characteristic diameter of fibers. The contact linear elasticity problem is considered. A two-scale approach is used for obtaining the effective mechanical properties. The algorithm using asymptotic two-scale homogenization for computation of the effective mechanical properties of textiles with periodic rod or fiber microstructure is proposed. The algorithm is based on the consequent passing to the asymptotics with respect to the in-plane period and the characteristic diameter of fibers. This allows to come to the equivalent homogenized problem and to reduce the dimension of the auxiliary problems. Further numerical simulations of the cell problems give the effective material properties of the textile. The homogenization of the boundary conditions on the vanishing out-of-plane interface of a textile or fiber structured layer has been studied. Introducing additional auxiliary functions into the formal asymptotic expansion for a heterogeneous plate, the corresponding auxiliary and homogenized problems for a nonhomogeneous Neumann boundary condition were deduced. It is incorporated into the right hand side of the homogenized problem via effective out-of-plane moduli. FiberFEM, a C++ finite element code for solving contact elasticity problems, is developed. The code is based on the implementation of the algorithm for the contact between fibers, proposed in the thesis. Numerical examples of homogenization of geotexiles and <b>wovens</b> are obtained in the work by implementation of the developed algorithm.

40|$|The load {{elongation}} behaviour of geotextiles is decisively {{influenced by the}} surrounding soil. This influence on behaviour has previously been quantifiable only insufficiently and cannot therefore be used in current dimensioning procedures. This uncertainty leads to low coefficients of utilisation of the geotextiles in the dimensioning procedures and thus to constructions which cannot be evaluated in terms of safety and which are often not economical. With the laboratory tests 'lateral pressure device' and 'transverse force introduction', the bond behaviour of geotextiles with the surrounding soil was realistically simulated and studied. These tests provided input parameters for calculations using the finite element method (FEM). Lateral pressure devices were used to study the {{load elongation}} behaviour of geotextiles in contact with soil. These test devices {{make it possible to}} apply a tensile load to the geotextiles in the soil. The geotextile sample is fastened on two clamps; one end is held in place. At the other end the tensile force is introduced. Vertically to the geotextile level, soil layers and compressed air bellows are installed. These compressed air bellows are used to simulate the load in the construction. In the tests, various geotextile products (mechanically bonded fabrics, thermally bonded fabric, woven textile) were studied. Two different types of soil (fine gravel and coarse clay) were used. The influence of the type of soil and the soil load on the load elongation behaviour were studied. The tests showed that the deformation behaviour of the geotextiles studies is decisively characterised by the soil. The deformation module of the geotextile samples is clearly higher in the bond with the soil than in the tests without contact to the soil. This is caused by the transmission of transverse strain between soil and geotextile and by the dispersion of soil particles {{in the structure of the}} geotextiles. Thus an inner bond arises. The raw material of the geotextiles had a clear influence on the deformation behaviour. The tests showed that exceptional suitability of polyester as a reinforcement material. The transverse movement test is a modified shear test in which a geotextile reinforcement is also installed in addition to the soil material. The reinforcement is perpendicular arranged in relation to the shear joint. This test construction is used to simulate the behaviour of the geotextile/soil/bond system in the proximity of the fracture joint in reinforced steep slopes which is formed when the shear strength of the soil material is exceeded. The deformation of the geotextile which occurs under this transverse force load causes an increase in the resistance to shearing and thus an increase of the ultimate load of these bond systems. On the basis of the results of this research study, it is possible to give a plausible explanation for the good success with geotextiles as reinforcement of earthworks. This success could not be comprehended, in particular for the non <b>wovens,</b> from the tests without soil, the results of which are included in the current dimensioning approaches. The results of this research study can, therefore, serve as the basis for a dimensioning approach which realistically records the influence of the soil and the deformations of the bond system.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the synthesis, {{characterization}} and applications of aliphatic segmented poly(ester amide) s (PEA) s for use as potential biomaterials. Three different series of PEAs with different microstructures containing isolated, two and three adjacent amide groups within a polybutylene adipate (PBA) chain have been synthesized. Analytical techniques such as NMR (liquid and solid-state), SEC, DSC, FT-IR, WAXD and microscopy (AFM, SEM, optical) have been extensively used to characterize the synthesized monomers and PEAs. Thermal properties have been determined and correlated to features like morphology and crystallization behaviour; structure-property relationship of these polymers were established. The preparation of tailor made monomers for the synthesis of PEAs {{was carried out by}} ring opening of epsilon-caprolactam, epsilon-caprolactone or delta-valerolactone with 1, 4 -diaminobutane, 4 -aminobutanol, 3 -aminopropanol and/or 2 -aminoethanol. These preformed monomers which are alpha,omega-diamines, alpha,omega-amino alcohols or alpha,omega-diols, each containing an in-built amide bond, were obtained in high purity and yields. Synthesis of the PEAs containing an isolated amide group, two or three adjacent amide groups was achieved by a two-step melt polycondensation of the preformed monomers with 1, 4 -butanediol and dimethyl adipate. In the first step, trans-esterification was carried out so as to avoid a random microstructure and hence, PEAs with segmented microstructure could be obtained. In the second step, polycondensation took place. Further, the amide content in each series could be varied by taking different ratios of the preformed monomer to 1, 4 -butanediol. High molecular weight PEAs were obtained in good yield and NMR analyses showed that no side reactions had taken place. Thermal analyses revealed that the length of the amide segment, functional groups participating in the crystallization process as well as the amide concentration influenced the transition temperatures and their enthalpies. For the three-adjacent amide series, mainly the amide groups crystallize and only a single endotherm and exotherm was seen. The melting and crystallization temperature increase with increasing amide content. Similar trend was also observed for the two-adjacent amide series of PEAs but here, both ester and amide groups co-crystallize and show multiple endotherms and exotherms. In the isolated amide series, mainly ester groups formed the hard domains and only at very high amide content, ester-amide co-crystallization was observed. FT-IR analyses revealed that the PEAs crystallize mainly in the alpha-form found in even-even nylons and the chains are bridged via hydrogen bonds. Morphology of the two-adjacent amide series of PEAs was investigated in detail using solid state NMR analyses. Spin diffusion experiments were performed to determine the domain sizes of the rigid, interface and mobile phases. A correlation of these domain sizes with the amide content in the PEA was successfully established. 13 C solid state NMR analyses gave information about the functional groups participating in the crystalline and amorphous phases which were in line with the observed thermal properties. The hydrolytic degradation of the synthesized PEAs was evaluated in PBS buffer at 37 °C over a time period of 24 weeks. The PEAs showed slow degradation kinetics and a maximum mass loss of 7 % over the entire time period which proceeded by cleavage of the ester bonds. Further, PEA foils sustain cell growth and are non-cytotoxic to mouse fibroblasts (L 929) cells. Electrospinning of the two-adjacent amide series of PEAs was carried out from solution in order to obtain non <b>wovens</b> for tissue engineering purposes. Among a series of solvents and solvent mixtures used, CHCl 3 /HCOOH mixtures gave the best results. Small amounts of formic acid were added to break the hydrogen bonds in the polymers. Effect of polymer concentration, microstructure and applied voltage on the resulting fibre diameter and morphology were also studied. Fibre quality and homogeneity enhanced with increasing amide content and polymer concentration and these factors played a decisive role in obtaining uniform, randomly oriented, homogeneous fibres in the nanometre range...|$|E
