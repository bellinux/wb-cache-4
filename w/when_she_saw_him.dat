5|$|Scully {{begins to}} {{question}} Berquist's motives, noting {{that she was}} the reason Mulder decided to look into this investigation. Mulder, however, begins to suspect Detweiler after learning that he had been at the vet's office; Mulder believes that he is the dhole and is tranquilizing himself in an attempt to stop murdering. Mulder asks Cahn to confront Detweiler, but Cahn is attacked and severely injured by the Dhole and placed in the hospital. Mulder then visits Berquist and says he thinks she has not been honest with him. Berquist reveals that she first suspected Detweiler <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him.</b> She also says that he will try to finish off Cahn. Mulder worriedly tells Scully, who remains skeptical.|$|E
5|$|Kelly {{admits to}} some problems, while making excuses for her boyfriend, {{such as his}} busy {{schedule}} and her own moodiness. Beyoncé, however, rolls her eyes at the thin excuses, and assures Kelly that she and Michelle love her and she does not need not to suffer alone. At this, Kelly begins to cry and laugh at the same time. Michelle goes on to tell her of the day she confronted her boyfriend <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> browsing through jewelry with another woman. During the last minute of the video, Kelly can seen be seen looking cold and angry as her boyfriend comes home. He arrives apologetic, but she perks up, dangling a pair of fuzzy handcuffs. He smiles and begins to follow her upstairs. In the following scene, he is naked except {{for a pair of}} boxers (in some versions, his rear-end is blurred out) and handcuffed to the balcony. With her bags packed and the handcuff key in hand, she leaves—laughing happily leaving her partner shocked and angry. The girls are finally seen walking down the city street, holding hands, as an image of the album cover of Destiny Fulfilled passes by on a city bus.|$|E
25|$|Paris, {{under the}} guise of a {{supposed}} diplomatic mission, went to Sparta to get Helen and bring her back to Troy. Before Helen could look up to see him enter the palace, she was shot with an arrow from Eros, otherwise known as Cupid, {{and fell in love with}} Paris <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> as promised by Aphrodite. Menelaus had left for Crete to bury his uncle, Crateus. Hera, still jealous over the judgement of Paris, sent a storm. The storm caused the lovers to land in Egypt, where the gods replaced Helen with a likeness of her made of clouds, Nephele. The myth of Helen being switched is attributed to the 6th century BC Sicilian poet Stesichorus. For Homer the true Helen was in Troy. The ship then landed in Sidon before reaching Troy. Paris, fearful of getting caught, spent some time there and then sailed to Troy.|$|E

60|$|She was {{blushing}} as <b>she</b> had blushed <b>when</b> <b>she</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> at Blanquais. <b>She</b> {{seemed to}} Bernard {{now to have}} a great and peculiar brightness--something she had never had before.|$|R
5000|$|Bule is a Palas Island Male {{who even}} {{impressed}} Daisy <b>when</b> <b>she</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>him.</b> Hamlet {{has tried to}} psych him out. He is bigger than Hamlet but a real gentle orangutan.|$|R
500|$|After telling Serah about Enchantress' menace, Angela and {{her fellow}} Witch Hunter {{departed}} from London and found a troupe of players called the [...] "Gardiner's Men" [...] (who are this domain's version of the Guardians of the Galaxy) being attacked by beasts in the woods. They aided the troupe members Madam Gomorrah, Peadar O'Cuill, Arthur Dubhghlas, Goodman Root, and Aroughcun to kill the beasts. As the creatures had traces of Enchantress' magic on them indicating she was somewhere nearby, Angela and Serah traveled with the Gardiner's Men to a pagan village in the outskirts of York where a marriage for the town beauty Anne Weying and the young printer's apprentice Edwin Brocc was going to happen. As the festival proceeded, Angela realized young Edwin had enchanted his bride to marry him <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> giving her a potion to drink. Edwin noticed Angela had seen and panicked becoming a venomous monster and attacking her. Angela and her companions engaged him in battle and subdued him, afterwards Angela decapitated him. While leaving the town, Serah told Angela she wasn't afraid of her fate as long as Angela was with her.|$|E
2500|$|While still a student, Ashcroft {{made her}} {{professional}} stage debut at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in {{a revival of}} J. M. Barrie's Dear Brutus opposite Ralph Richardson, {{with whom she had}} been greatly impressed <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> in Charles Doran's touring company while she was still a schoolgirl. She graduated from the Central School in 1927 with London University's Diploma in Dramatic Art. Never much drawn to the West End or stardom, she learned her craft with mostly small companies in fringe theatres. Her first notable West End role was Naemi in Jew Süss in 1929, an extravagantly theatrical production, in which she won praise for the naturalism and truth of her playing. In the same year she married Rupert Hart-Davis, then an aspiring actor, later a well-known publisher. He later described the marriage as [...] "a sad failure: we were much too young to know what we wanted... after much agony we parted and were duly divorced. Nowadays Peggy and I lunch together perhaps {{once or twice a year}} in a Soho restaurant and have a lovely nostalgic-romantic talk of shared memories of long ago. She is a lovely person and the best actress living." ...|$|E
60|$|But Marguerite gave a happy {{little laugh}} <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> coming towards her.|$|E
60|$|He had got {{thus far}} <b>when</b> <b>she</b> turned and <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> and he {{abandoned}} poetry {{in the presence}} of one who might well have inspired it.|$|R
60|$|She {{had reached}} out for <b>him</b> <b>when</b> suddenly, as <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> closely, {{something}} checked her, and as quickly all her joy fled, and with it her color, leaving her pale and trembling.|$|R
60|$|Geoffrey {{hesitated for}} a few seconds, and Thomas Savine smiled at {{something}} which faintly amused him. Remembering Helen's freezing look and his occupation <b>when</b> <b>she</b> last <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> Geoffrey felt {{that it might not}} be pleasant to meet her so soon. Then, because he was a proud man, he endeavored to accept the invitation with cordiality.|$|R
60|$|Miss Sampson gasped <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> {{and both}} her hands flew to her breast.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> {{again in}} the evening, of course she asked him some farther questions.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly {{it was to}} {{this part}} of the rampart he ran with Hester in his strong arms. We have said that Sally ran after the sailor with anxiety, but that feeling was deepened into dismay <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> {{approach}} the portion of the wall just described, and she gave out one of her loudest coffee-pestle gasps <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> jump straight off the wall without a moment's hesitation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our white servant, him whom Billali {{names the}} Pig; also," [...] and here I spoke with some little hesitation, [...] "a woman named Ustane, a very {{handsome}} woman of this country, who came and embraced <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> and hath stayed by him ever since, as I understand is {{the fashion of}} thy people, oh Queen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not so {{very long}} neither. I'm ninety, come Candlemas; but it don't seem long since I took the bounty. And that battle, {{it might have}} been yesterday. Eh, but I get a power o' good from my rations!" [...] He did indeed look less worn and {{colourless}} than <b>when</b> <b>she</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>him.</b> His face was flushed and his back more erect.|$|R
6000|$|There was Alured, {{almost exactly}} what Trevor had been <b>when</b> last <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> with his bright sweet honest face over the rose, {{running up the}} stairs, knocking, and coming in with his boyish, [...] "Good morning, Hester, I do hope you are better;" [...] and bending down with his fresh brotherly kiss on her poor hot forehead, [...] "I've got this rose for you, the bud {{will be out in}} a day or two." ...|$|R
60|$|The princess gave {{a cry of}} joy <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> and, running forward, {{threw herself}} into his arms.|$|E

60|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> {{she made}} a sudden, instinctive {{movement}} to go to him, but Chauvelin interposed in his usual bland, quiet manner.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Arabin {{was very}} near to her <b>when</b> <b>she</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> and <b>she</b> turned short round and retraced her steps down the avenue, trying to rid her cheeks of all {{trace of the}} {{tell-tale}} tears. It was a needless endeavour, for Mr. Arabin {{was in a state}} of mind that hardly allowed him to observe such trifles. He followed her down the walk and overtook her just as she reached the end of it.|$|R
60|$|Thus {{keeping a}} {{speculative}} watch on all persons of possible managerial aspect, Octavia, with a catching breath and a start of surprise, suddenly {{became aware of}} Teddy Westlake hurrying along the platform {{in the direction of}} the train--of Teddy Westlake or his sun-browned ghost in cheviot, boots and leather-girdled hat--Theodore Westlake, Jr., amateur polo (almost) champion, all-round butterfly and cumberer of the soil; but a broader, surer, more emphasized and determined Teddy than the one she had known a year ago <b>when</b> last <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
5000|$|When {{they were}} both living in the United States, Zborowski came twice {{to the home of}} Elisabeth Poretsky one day—in the spring of 1955, she believed, {{according}} to her memoirs. This followed visits by the FBI, who came to her and inquired about [...] "Etienne" [...] (as she refers to him). During their second visit, the FBI informed her that they believed Zborowski to be an NKVD agent. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> next <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> Zborowski barged into her home once the door opened.|$|R
6000|$|... "What is it, Dave?" [...] cried his sister, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> {{with the}} letter in his hand. [...] "Is it your civil {{engineering}} report?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Alder died in June 1958, aged 55. The {{cause of}} his death is unknown, however his {{body was found in}} his {{apartment}} in Cologne, Germany after two weeks. His niece, who found the body, stated that the odor of rotting flesh was so bad that she could smell it from the street outside. Gertrud Alder reported that her husband was incredibly distressed <b>when</b> <b>she</b> last <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> and often muttered the phrase [...] "Les Jardins du Souvenir" [...] whilst writing out his research notes.|$|R
60|$|Tess jumped up, but her visitor {{had knocked}} at the door, and she could hardly in reason run away. D'Urberville's knock, his {{walk up to the}} door, had some indescribable quality of {{difference}} from his air <b>when</b> <b>she</b> last <b>saw</b> <b>him.</b> They seemed to be acts of which the doer was ashamed. She thought that she would not open the door; but, as there was no sense in that either, she arose, and having lifted the latch stepped back quickly. He came in, saw her, and flung himself down into a chair before speaking.|$|R
6000|$|She still [...] "cheeked" [...] my uncle, I {{was pleased}} to find. [...] "What are you old Poking in for at THIS time--Gubbitt?" [...] <b>she</b> said <b>when</b> he appeared, and she still looked with a practised eye for the facetious side of things. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> me behind <b>him,</b> <b>she</b> gave a little cry and stood up radiant. Then she became grave.|$|R
60|$|It was Panchita. She {{had slipped}} through the picket fence and was half-way across the patch. She stopped <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> {{and looked at him}} without wavering.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> first, and Sophy {{a moment}} afterwards, she sprang {{up to him}} as he dismounted, and greeted him with a burst of sobs and thankful tears.|$|E
60|$|MARCHBANKS. No, no: I--I-- (blurting out the {{explanation}} desperately) --it was David's wife. And it wasn't at home: it was <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> dancing {{before all the}} people.|$|E
2500|$|... {{she must}} live where she was, a {{prisoner}} chained to a cruel rock; {{but she would}} not repine, she could wait, for the time of her deliverance was near. Her liberator was coming. He was at her feet; he was her child, her boy, her darling; and <b>when</b> he slumbered <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> wax and grow, and <b>when</b> he awoke <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> her fetters break. Thus on the bridge of hope's own rainbow she spanned her little world of shame and pain.|$|R
50|$|Hemingway {{possesses}} an exoskeletal mutation {{that gives}} him razor-sharp bony protrusion from his back and arms {{that can be used}} for weapons. In addition to this he can greatly increase his size to immense proportions, augmenting his superhuman strength and durability in the process. His mutation seems to be one that is constantly evolving, as in Uncanny X-Men #325 Callisto mentions that he seemed to be mutated further from <b>when</b> <b>she</b> last <b>saw</b> <b>him.</b> Now whether that is due to his mutation or to some added time on the Hill (whose timeline moves faster) remains to be seen. Another possibility is that it is the artists' renderings of him, which vary each time.|$|R
60|$|The dark {{figure of}} her guardian's {{secretary}} had attracted her {{attention from the}} moment <b>when</b> <b>she</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> moving silently about the house and park: the first words she spoke to him were words of sympathy. His life-story--brief and simple as it had been--had interested her. He seemed so different from these young and old country squires who frequented Acol Court. He neither wooed nor flattered her, yet seemed to find great joy in her company. His voice at times was harsh, his manner abrupt and even rebellious, but at others it fell to infinite gentleness when he talked to her of Nature and the stars, both {{of which he had}} studied deeply.|$|R
