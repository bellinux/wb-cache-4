5|$|Civil War tokens are token coins {{that were}} privately minted and {{distributed}} in the United States between 1861 and 1864. They were used mainly in the Northeast and Midwest. The <b>widespread</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the tokens {{was a result of}} the scarcity of government-issued cents during the Civil War.|$|E

5|$|A type of refined cooking {{developed}} in the late Middle Ages that set the standard among the nobility all over Europe. Common seasonings in the highly spiced sweet-sour repertory typical of upper-class medieval food included verjuice, wine and vinegar in combination with spices such as black pepper, saffron and ginger. These, along with the <b>widespread</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> sugar or honey, gave many dishes a sweet-sour flavour. Almonds were very popular as a thickener in soups, stews, and sauces, particularly as almond milk.|$|E
5|$|Cagney, born in 1899 (prior to <b>widespread</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> automobiles), loved horses from childhood. As a child, {{he often}} {{sat on the}} horses of local deliverymen, and rode in horse-drawn streetcars with his mother. As an adult, well after horses were {{replaced}} by automobiles as the primary mode of transportation, Cagney raised horses on his farms, specializing in Morgans, a breed {{of which he was}} particularly fond.|$|E

50|$|A few halocarbons, {{including}} acid halides like acetyl chloride, {{are highly}} reactive; these are rarely found outside chemical processing. The <b>widespread</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> halocarbons were often driven by observations {{that most of}} them were more stable than other substances. They may be less affected by acids or alkalis; they may not burn as readily; they may not be attacked by bacteria or molds; or they may not be affected as much by sun exposure.|$|R
50|$|To {{meet the}} needs of big cities and the modern lifestyle, the {{traditional}} process was mechanized to increase production of tortillas. In the 1940s and 1950s, one <b>of</b> the first <b>widespread</b> <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> small gas engines and electric motors was to power wet-grain grinders for making masa. A hand press or hand patting were still used to form it into tortillas, but by the 1960s, small-scale tortilla-making machines could produce cooked tortillas every two seconds.|$|R
5|$|Folk metal is {{a fusion}} genre of heavy metal music and {{traditional}} folk music that developed in Europe during the 1990s. It is characterised by the <b>widespread</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> folk instruments and, {{to a lesser}} extent, traditional singing styles (for example, Dutch Heidevolk, Danish Sylvatica and Spanish Stone of Erech). It also sometimes features soft instrumentation influenced by folk rock.|$|E

5|$|More generally, {{people make}} {{a wide range}} of uses of insects, both {{practical}} and symbolic. On the other hand, attitudes to insects are often negative, and extensive efforts are made to kill them. The <b>widespread</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> insecticides has failed to exterminate any insect pest, but has caused resistance to commonly-used chemicals in a thousand insect species.|$|E

5|$|The annual {{incidence}} is about 1.1 per 100,000 annually in population studies from the United States and France. From 1994 to 2003, the incidence increased threefold; {{this has been}} attributed to the more <b>widespread</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> modern imaging modalities rather than a true increase. Similarly, those living in urban areas are more likely to receive appropriate investigations, accounting for increased rates of diagnosis in those dwelling in cities. It is suspected that a proportion of cases in people with mild symptoms remains undiagnosed.|$|E
5|$|The most <b>widespread</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> 241AmBe neutron {{sources is}} a neutron probe – a device {{used to measure}} the {{quantity}} of water present in soil, as well as moisture/density for quality control in highway construction. 241Am neutron sources are also used in well logging applications, as well as in neutron radiography, tomography and other radiochemical investigations.|$|E

The China operations also produce three print publications in Chinese. Traffic to cn.nytimes.com, meanwhile, has risen due to the <b>widespread</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> VPN technology in the PRC and to a growing Chinese audience outside mainland China. New York Times articles are also available to users in China via the use of mirror websites, apps, domestic newspapers, and social media. The Chinese platforms now represent one of The New York Times top five digital markets globally. The editor-in-chief of the Chinese platforms is Ching-Ching Ni.|$|E
5|$|Following the <b>widespread</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> {{poliovirus}} vaccine in the mid-1950s, {{the incidence}} of poliomyelitis declined dramatically in many industrialized countries. A global effort to eradicate polio began in 1988, led by the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and The Rotary Foundation. These efforts have {{reduced the number of}} annual diagnosed cases by 99.9 percent; from an estimated 350,000 cases in 1988 to a low of 483 cases in 2001, after which it remained at a level of about 1,000 - 2000 cases per year for a number of years. In 2015, cases decreased to 98 and further decreased in 2016 to 37 wild cases and 5 circulating vaccine-derived cases.|$|E
5|$|However, the <b>widespread</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> {{antipsychotic}} drugs {{has long}} been controversial. There are several reasons for this. First, antipsychotic drugs are perceived as very aversive {{by people who have}} to take them, because they produce a general dullness of thought and suppress the ability to experience pleasure. Second, it is difficult to show that they act specifically against psychotic behaviors rather than merely suppressing all types of active behavior. Third, they can produce a range of serious side effects, including weight gain, diabetes, fatigue, sexual dysfunction, hormonal changes, and a type of serious movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia. Some of these side effects may continue long after the cessation of drug use, or even permanently.|$|E

2500|$|The {{extensive}} production industrialisation {{that resulted}} was not responsive to consumer needs and caused a neglect {{in the service}} sector, unprecedented rapid urbanisation, acute urban overcrowding, chronic shortages and massive recruitment of women into mostly menial and/or low-paid occupations.

5|$|In 1980, {{gastroenteritis}} {{from all}} causes caused 4.6 million deaths in children, {{with the majority}} occurring in the developing world. Death rates were reduced significantly (to approximately 1.5 million deaths annually) by the year 2000, {{largely due to the}} introduction and <b>widespread</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> oral rehydration therapy. In the US, infections causing gastroenteritis are the second most common infection (after the common cold), and they result in between 200 and 375million cases of acute diarrhea and approximately ten thousand deaths annually, with 150 to 300 of these deaths in children less than five years of age.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, {{the use of}} {{the flag}} and other {{national}} symbols has been relatively low for most of the time since the Second World War—a reaction against the <b>widespread</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> flags by the Nazi Party and against the nationalistic furore of the Nazis in general. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which took place in Germany, public use of the national flag increased dramatically. Although this explosion in the flag's popularity was initially greeted by many Germans with a mixture of surprise and apprehension, the decades-old fear that German flag-waving and national pride was inextricably associated with its Nazi past was dismissed {{by the end of the}} tournament by Germans and non-Germans alike.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s the Soviet {{authorities}} {{began the}} <b>widespread</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> psychiatric treatment {{as a form}} of punishment and deterrence for the independent-minded. This involved unlimited detention in a psikhushka, as such places were popularly known, which might be conventional psychiatric hospitals or psychiatric prison-hospitals set up (e.g. the Leningrad Special Psychiatricl Hospital) as part of an existing penal institution. Healthy individuals were held among mentally ill and often dangerous patients; they were forced to take various psychotropic drugs; they might also be incarcerated in prison-type institutions under overall control of the KGB.|$|E
