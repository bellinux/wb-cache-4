5000|$|While the {{carbamate}} acetylcholinesterase inhibitors {{are commonly}} referred to as [...] "carbamate insecticides" [...] due to their generally high selectivity for insect acetylcholinesterase enzymes over the mammalian versions, the most potent compounds such as aldicarb and carbofuran are still capable of inhibiting mammalian acetylcholinesterase enzymes at low enough concentrations that they pose a significant risk of poisoning to humans, especially when used in large amounts for agricultural applications. Other carbamate based acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are known with even higher toxicity to humans, and some such as T-1123 and EA-3990 were investigated for potential military use as nerve agents. However, since all compounds of this type have a quaternary ammonium group with a permanent positive charge, they have poor blood-brain barrier penetration, and also are only stable as crystalline salts or aqueous solutions, and so were not considered to have suitable properties for <b>weaponisation.</b>|$|E
50|$|North Korea did {{not sign}} CWC and is {{believed}} to have maintained an extensive chemical weapons program since mid-1950s.

Several dozen facilities has been identified as likely involved in the offensive program. The production capability of these facilities is estimated as 4500 tons of chemical agents per year. North Korean armed forces have also large quantities of delivery systems that could carry chemical warheads, including different artillery systems, aerial bombs, mines, tactical ballistic missiles (SCUD), and long-range ballistic missiles (Nodong and Taepodong-2 systems).

5000|$|The South African {{chemical}} weapons program investigated all the standard CW agents such as irritant riot control agents, lethal nerve agents and anticholinergic deliriants, {{which have been}} researched by virtually all countries that have carried out CW research. The South African program differed in its aims from the CBW programmes of many countries in that {{a major focus of}} the program was to develop non-lethal agents to help suppress internal dissent. This led to the investigation of unusual non-lethal agents, including illicit recreational drugs such as phencyclidine, MDMA, methaqualone and cocaine, as well as medicinal drugs such as diazepam, ketamine, suxamethonium and tubocurarine, as potential incapacitating agents. According to the testimony given by Wouter Basson to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, analogues of these compounds were prepared and studied, and both methaqualone and MDMA (along with the deliriant BZ) were manufactured in large quantities and successfully weaponised into a fine dust or aerosol form that could be released over a crowd as a potential riot control agent. Basson was later found to have also been selling large quantities of MDMA and methaqualone as tablets on the black market, but the amount manufactured was far larger than what was sold and the court accepted that at least some genuine <b>weaponisation</b> and testing of these agents had been done. A black mamba and extracted venom were also part of the research, as were E coli O157:H7 bacteria genetically modified to produce some of the toxins made by Clostridium prefringens bacteria.

Other plans referenced in the UN report included crowd control with pheremones, and a discussion about developing a new, stronger analogue of methaqualone.Another unusual project attempted to develop a method of sterilising crowds using a known male sterilant pyridine. This was to be sprayed onto the crowds from a gas cylinder pressurised with nitrogen gas, as pyridine is highly flammable.

The US is actively pursuing an RMA, conceptualised as integrating new IT into weapons systems and integrated command, control, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C 4 ISR) and, in turn, doctrinal, operational and organisational change in the military to take advantage of information dominance on the battlefield. This relates to MD and the <b>weaponisation</b> of space in two ways. Firstly, very few countries have the financial and technological capability to modernise their defence forces along the lines of a US-defined RMA, which means that they may resort to so-called asymmetric means to exploit the vulnerabilities or weaknesses of a strong, conventional power. Ballistic missiles (in association with chemical, biological or nuclear payloads) are one of the asymmetrical threats most commonly cited in speeches and military documents of the US and used as justification of MD. Secondly, the RMA increases the US military’s reliance on space-based military assets for C 4 ISR. Placing weapons in space to protect these assets is seen as a logical step to ensure a key aspect of US dominance on the battlefield. This pape...|$|E

40|$|In {{measure to}} the {{development}} of projectile weaponry, the conduct of modern war has accorded perception with destruction, marshalling and enfolding human vision into ever more sophisticated sociotechnical assemblages of targeting. Drawing upon Paul Virilio’s notion of a “logistics of perception”, this article charts the four successive orders of targeting constituted by the alignment of the line of sight with the line of fire (aiming), the measurement of distance to a target (ranging), the trailing and prediction of a target’s movement (tracking), and the directed navigation to a target’s position in space (guiding). Alongside the functional specification of each of these orders are concurrently drawn out the accompanying corporeal regimentations of the living organisms thus imbricated. With its capillaries now spanning the wider ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum, the contemporary war machine has simultaneously extended its sensorial reach far beyond the confines of its original human strictures.

40|$|According to the Generation IV International Forum Technology Roadmap, Sodium Fast Reactors (SFR) {{could be}} a {{promising}} technology for minor actinides management. In view of a much higher radiological barrier, the addition of minor actinides to fresh fuel assemblies would change {{the way in which}} fresh fuel can be stored and handled, impacting not only on routine operations but also on the activities carried out during international safeguards inspections. While it is generally considered that the presence of minor actinides in fresh fuel assemblies would decrease the attractiveness of this potential target for a proliferator willing to divert nuclear material - thus increasing the proliferation resistance of the entire facility -, it might have perverse repercussions on the overall safeguardability of the target. In particular, the presence of minor actinides might complicate the measurement activities performed by safeguards inspectors during physical inventory verifications (PIV). The level of impact depends on the actual composition of the available fuel and might affect the current safeguards approach.

This regime has served well enough for almost 50 years. In recent years, however, fears of space <b>weaponisation,</b> the proliferation of space debris in the Low Earth Orbits (LEO) and increasing demands on the electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) have led to demands for regulatory reform.

The world is struggling to determine whether, and if so how, to regulate the cyberspace. The United States now considers cyberspace to be the fifth domain of warfare and has announced that it reserves the right to meet cyber attacks, on interests it considers vital, with conventional kinetic responses.

Other regimes that may well prove important in the longer term include: the international criminal court and other international criminal law entities; the UN Secretary General¿s investigation mechanism and other ad hoc UN investigatory mechanisms. A comprehensive HAC strategy for the regulation of RCAs, incapacitants and related means of delivery will also require active involvement of informed and activist civil society in societal verification; development and promotion of norms prohibiting the involvement of scientific and medical communities in <b>weaponisation</b> programmes intended for malign application; and far greater active engagement of such expert communities in relevant State and international policy development processes...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{answers to}} prayer in Chaucer’s works. It contextualises this analysis through attention to late-medieval devotion, arguing that Chaucer uses petitionary prayer both to explore important themes, {{such as the}} injustice of suffering innocence, and to challenge elements of contemporary religious practice. Chapter One explores petitionary prayer in theory, teaching, and lay practice, proving that late-medieval understandings of prayer’s effectiveness are varied, contradictory, and at times problematic. Two of Chaucer’s dream visions, 'The Book of the Duchess' and 'The House of Fame', feature in the second chapter, which demonstrates that answers to prayer in these texts fulfil a dual function, operating both as literary device and as the means through which Chaucer examines themes of profound importance which recur throughout his works. Chapter Three addresses conflicting prayers in two romances, arguing that Chaucer uses answered prayer in 'The Knight’s Tale' to obliquely critique the <b>weaponisation</b> of prayer in contemporary Christian society, inviting a focus on human responsibility for conflict, and that this emphasis on agency is continued through relegating the role of prayer in 'The Franklin’s Tale'. Chapter Four analyses the divergent discourses surrounding prayer in the hagiographic tales, concluding that {{the extent to which}} the narratorial voice faithfully represents the answers to the hagiographic subject’s prayers depends on the didactic purpose expressed. The final chapter examines the unanswered and unanswerable prayers of 'Troilus and Criseyde', arguing that Chaucer offers the poem’s Trinitarian conclusion and a poetic recreation of the Boethian conception of time in response to the problems posed by these prayers. This thesis demonstrates that, rather than operating as a mere device for advancing plots, petitionary prayer provides Chaucer with a powerful tool with which to pursue several philosophical and theological issues at the heart of his writing...|$|E

Working group members presented their cases at a simulated domestic regulatory panel, constructed of members representing various government ministers, to fully explore stakeholder views. The mock hearings explored the challenges faced by OOS and ADR entrepreneurs as well as the benefit of regulation. The groups highlighted recommendations to ensure the practicality of OOS and determine how best to encourage licensing and regulation of such activities, as summarised below. 1. The United Nations (UN) should provide regulatory guidelines for OOS and ADR. 2. Government agencies should license OOS. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has taken responsibility for licensing commercial space transportation in the United States and this should be extended to OOS/ADR missions to enable short-term advancement prior to further UN regulation. 3. Government should support OOS and ADR development to ensure continued demand. This includes leading by example on government satellites and potential launch levies to enable on-going ADR funding. 4.

Crucially, access to accurate information is required to enable appropriate responses for potential threats. The high interest created by a recent review of fungi and toxins as weapons indicated that further publications in the field are desirable: Paterson (2006 a) remained at number 1 in Science Direct's Top 25 Hottest Articles (Mycological Research) for a year. Citation numbers put it fourth since 2006 : Holstege et al. (2007) is instructive as it indicates just how seriously the threat is taken in the United States of America. The authors focus on trichothecene mycotoxins and particularly T- 2 toxin. Of course, the reasons for the topicality were the mass attacks on citizens which have occurred this century, and the claim that aflatoxins had the potential to be used by Iraq. The recent attacks in the USA using anthrax spores via internal post also caused a great deal of concern: massive casualties have been predicted from anthrax released into very large cites. Dohnal et al. (2007) are also concerned with T- 2 toxin. Latxague et al. (2007) focuses on anticrop bioterrorism and bioweapons against the agricultural sector. They appear to be more concerned with whole organisms, rather than purified mycotoxins per se. However, it is difficult to obtain a list of the fungi with which Latxague et al. are concerned, no doubt for security reasons. Mycotoxin-producing fungi need to be on the list, as do plant pathogens. Also, countries where crops are developed almost as a monoculture are at particular risk from natural pathogens [e. g. the fungus Ganoderma and the oil palm crop (Paterson et al. 2009) ]. Pohanka et al. (2007) considered the issue of developing bioassays to detect mycotoxins.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to provide a fresh {{analysis}} of middle-power states' capabilities within the international political arena, utilising an integrated experimental model to conduct a unit-level of analysis of Turko-Iraman relations with a focus on economic, diplomatic, political and military issues. The principal argument of this study is that the middle-power state is the key actor in the region, socially constructed within a distinctive political context; resisting super power hegemonic intervention, and having bargaining power with regard to more powerful entities. The socially constructed identities of Turkey and Iran are highlighted as key influences in foreign relations, leading to a complex dynamic between these 'reluctant neighbours. ' The limits of their power are clarified as consisting of employing agent groups to manipulate internal threats and apply counter-terrorist/revolutionary politics, but falling short of sufficient to control transnational nationalism. Using this ethnic political card to negate each other's influence invites foreign power penetration into regional politics. Kurdish nationalism acts as an independent regional player and challenges the Turkish and Iranian political identities, both secularist and religious. Turkey and Iran endavour to apply the 'niche diplomacy' in energy and pipeline routes competition in the Southern Caucasus. The study, thus, examines the competing factors of the both countries' geographic adjacency as a stimulus for economic integration as a partial entrenchment against diplomatic mistrust, and preventing systematic regional integration within the last three decades within the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) framework. The role of Iran's nuclear ambitions and Turkey's western alliances are examined as influences on the countries' identities. Contrary to the systemic and regional circumstances of secularist Turkey, the messianic identity of Iranian religious nationalism has resulted in a nuclear <b>weaponisation</b> programme that not only militarises the domestic politics of Iran, but also undermines the countries' mutual trust, with a profound adverse effect on the countries' economic relationship. In order to increase the efficiency and explanatory power of middle-power state, this study amended the middle-power state theory, and successfully tested its applicability to Turkish-Iranian relationship through various variables related to international relations, international policy aspects of domestic political events, ethnic tension and economic relations.

40|$|Since {{the end of}} the Second World War the {{potential}} use of outer space for military purposes persisted to be intrinsically linked to the development of space technology and space flight. The launch of the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, by the USSR in 1957 made Western states realise that a surprise attack from space was a real possibility, resulting in the so-called "space-race" between the USA and the USSR. During the Cold War space activities were intrinsically linked to the political objectives, priorities and national security concerns of the USA and the Soviet Union. After the Cold War the political relevance and benefits of space continued to be recognised by states. In view of the recent emergence of new major space powers such as China, the focus has again shifted to the military use of outer space and {{the potential}} that a state with advanced space technology may use it for military purposes in order to dominate other states. Article IV of the Outer Space Treaty prohibits the installation of nuclear weapons and {{weapons of mass destruction in}} outer space and determines that the moon and other celestial bodies shall be used for peaceful purposes only. Due to the dual-use character of many space assets, the distinction between military and non-military uses of outer space is becoming increasingly blurred. This article discusses a number of legal challenges presented by article IV of the Outer Space Treaty, relating specifically to the term peaceful, the distinction between the terms militarisation and <b>weaponisation</b> and the nature of a space weapon. It is concluded that article IV is in many respects outdated and that it cannot address the current legal issues relating to the military use of outer space. The legal vacuum in this area may have grave consequences not only for maintaining peace and security in outer space, but also on earth. Consequently, an international dialogue on the military uses of outer space should be facilitated under the auspices of the UNCOPUOS to address these uncertainties as a matter of urgency. Although it is agreed with the proponents of a hard law approach that a legally binding instrument should be adopted to regulate the military use of outer space, it is submitted that, as an interim measure, soft law guidelines should be developed to provide a framework for the eventual creation of a consolidated and binding legal instrument on all aspects relating to the use of outer space...|$|E
40|$|Afghanistan, {{home to one}} of {{the longest}} running {{conflicts}} in the modern era, is a land of extremes, from its history {{to the development of the}} largest segmented tribal society in the world, where the ethos of the warrior archetype continues to exist to the detriment of every single invader since the beginning of recorded history in the region. This study, cognizant of the dire insecurity inherent within the conflict environment of Afghanistan, sets out to provide a holistic narrative of the processes, methods, techniques, and resources used in the financing, acquisition, transportation, possession and use of small arms and light weapons (SALW) in the country, while also analysing whether or not a correlation exists between the mass diffusion and availability of SALW and the direct and indirect effects of their possession and use on the dynamics of conflict. As such, this study hypothesises that the mass diffusion of SALW assists the exacerbation of the conflict in Afghanistan. An analysis of the essential dynamics involved in the eruption and propagation of conflicts is also provided in chapter two through an appreciation of the escalation of conflicts to higher intensities of violence by introducing the concept of the acceleration of conflict, the rate of increase in intensity of the conflict, and how this may be contributed to by the introduction of SALW at significant points at which the conflict is susceptible to rising to a higher degree of conflict intensity. Furthermore, to amplify the understanding being imparted, chapter three illustrates the intrinsic historical evolution of the country's ethnic and cultural diversity, and how this has affected the development of the defensive structural organisation of Afghanistan's tribal societies through unrelenting invasions and conflicts by parties both external and indigenous to Afghanistan, and the consequential development of culturally reinforced regulatory structures in relation to the possession and use of SALW; which impact upon the way individuals and communities may perceive, behave, react and be affected by the possession and use of SALW. The <b>weaponisation</b> of Afghanistan is a primary element of discussion and analysis in this study. Therefore, chapters four to seven provide a detailed and comprehensive understanding of the historical processes, mechanisms, techniques, and methods used in the development of an indigenous production capacity, trade, transportation, as well as the rationale for the mass diffusion of SALW in Afghanistan from their first use and introduction into the region in 1526 until 11 September 2001. However, the specific processes, mechanisms and networks established by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) arms pipeline through Operation Cyclone, which was operational throughout the Soviet occupation in the 1980 s, is emphasised in chapter six. Moreover, the CIA arms pipeline's associated financial and logistical problems, and self-perpetuation of its networks, processes, and methods are analysed within the context of the geostrategic rationale behind the diffusion of SALW in Afghanistan and how they continue to contribute to the intractability of the Afghan conflict. In order to appreciate the central proposition of this study, chapter eight analyses the direct effects of the possession and use of SALW, through their physical and psychological impacts on individuals and collectives, and their resulting behaviour; while, chapter nine analyses their indirect effects through the institutionalisation and militarisation of the social environment and the promotion of violent alternatives to negotiation, the lowering of the threshold of violence, encouragement of criminal activities, amplification of social insecurity, increase in SALW possession through the security dilemma, emboldening of the disaffected, and the facilitation of the entrenchment of cycles of violence in the conflict environment. In respect to the central proposition, this study finds that there is an inherent difficulty in divorcing the specific individual impacts and effects of the proliferation of SALW from those impacts and effects of major conventional weapons that are usually used in-sync with the former, as well as the macro-scale geostrategic, regional, national and local imperatives of the conflicting parties throughout the scope, depth, and chronological development of the Afghan conflict. The discussion, therefore, emphasises the complexity of the protraction of conflict through the inherent diversity in the contention of ideas, beliefs, values and interests that are confined within the geographical boundaries, and historical, socio-cultural and strategic contexts of Afghanistan. As such, this study finds that an absolute correlation between the mass availability of SALW and the exacerbation of conflict may not be possible; however, this study recognises that the available evidence, as discussed here, does significantly support the essence of the central proposition...|$|E
