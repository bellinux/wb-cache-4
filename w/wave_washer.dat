50|$|A <b>wave</b> <b>washer</b> also {{acts as a}} spring, but wave washers of {{comparable}} size do not produce as much force as Belleville washers, nor can they be stacked in series.|$|E
50|$|A washer is a {{thin plate}} (typically disk-shaped) with a hole (typically in the middle) that is {{normally}} used to distribute the load of a threaded fastener, such as a screw or nut. Other uses are as a spacer, spring (belleville washer, <b>wave</b> <b>washer),</b> wear pad, preload indicating device, locking device, and to reduce vibration (rubber washer). Washers often have an outer diameter (OD) about twice their inner diameter (ID), but this can vary quite widely.|$|E
5000|$|Wave spring - {{the name}} applies to a {{multitude}} of wave shaped springs, washers and expanders, including linear springs, {{all of which are}} generally made with flat wire or discs which are marcelled according to industrial terms, usually by die-stamping, into a wavy regular pattern resulting in curvilinear lobes. Round wire wave springs exist as well. Types include : <b>wave</b> <b>washer,</b> single turn wave spring, multi-turn wave spring, linear wave spring, marcel expander, interlaced wave spring and nested wave spring amongst others.|$|E
50|$|One {{multi-turn}} {{wave spring}} replaces multiple stacked <b>wave</b> <b>washers.</b> This eases installation and reduces maintenance times.|$|R
5000|$|... {{the intake}} rocker arms are marked {{so they are}} {{correctly}} placed on the rocker shaft when servicing. An IN1 or IN2 will be embossed on each rocker arm. As viewed {{from the front of}} the engine the Number 1 intake valve of each cylinder and the number 2 intake valve have an IN1 marked and IN2 marked rocker arm that mates with it. New IN1 rocker arms can also be identified by a Green painted mark on the top of the rocker arm. The IN2 rocker arms have a white mark. Proper positioning is maintained through the use of a <b>wave</b> <b>washer</b> located between the rocker shaft arm and rocker arm shaft support.|$|E
5000|$|General Motors {{provided}} a fix for [...] "Noise #1" [...] but stated that [...] "Noise #2" [...] was {{a characteristic of}} any car equipped with a manual transmission and that a similar noise could be repeated by lugging the engine. The remedy for [...] "Noise #1" [...] was to overfill the transmission with Saturn Manual Transmission Lubricant from the stock 1.8 quarts to 2.6 quarts. Although this seemed to work for many customers, many other complaints still surfaced and in 2003 General Motors released another TSB urging customers that still have the rattling noise in their transmissions should bring their vehicles in to their nearest General Motors affiliated dealer for a more complex fix. This time, GM Technicians had concluded that gears one and two required additional thrust loads and proceeded to install a <b>wave</b> <b>washer</b> between the blocking ring and speed gears for gears three and four. This indeed fixed the rattle issue once and for all, but has more recently been lamented in many online communities as causing a bigger problem than it solves, as many customers that received this fix reported third and fourth gears grinding {{from time to time}} while shifting. Afterwards, many owners of these vehicles have concluded that leaving the transmission alone was for the best, as the rattling noise has been proven to be harmless.|$|E
