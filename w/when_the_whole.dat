Borrowers were then allowed to defer paying interest on the loan {{until the end of}} the period, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> amount plus interest accrued was due.

5|$|The {{vegetation}} of Strandzha evolved {{before the}} formation of the Bosphorus Strait <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> southern Black Sea coast was linked and represents the westernmost extension of the Euxine-Colchic ecoregion. Because of the proximity of three seas, the Black Sea, the Marmara Sea and the Aegean Sea, Strandzha remained unaffected by the Quaternary glaciation and retained its mild and relatively humid climate. Under those conditions the region has preserved relict species from the Neogene.|$|E

5|$|The comic series , {{picks up}} {{immediately}} after {{the events of the}} television series. Connor is shown sprinting home as ordered by Angel. He debates going back but gets drawn into the battle <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> city is sent to hell by the Senior Partners. A veteran of hell, Connor takes it upon himself to provide sanctuary to humans and good demons. Along to help him are the benevolent werewolf Nina Ash, the mutant Gwen Raiden, and the vampire Spike. Connor also becomes much closer to Angel as he joins his newest battle to wrestle back control of the city from Demon Lords. Part of the story centers on Connor and Gwen's romance, which ends when he discovers Gwen has betrayed the team.|$|E
5|$|The film {{continues}} to be appreciated for its experimental nature, its camera angles and montage elements being treated in an unusual manner, while the fiction elements of the screenplay hint of magic realism. In this sense, {{it is important to}} mention that the days in the film are separated by Andrei's erotic dreams. In his dreams, the differences between him and Marilena are partially removed, either by lowering the rooftop on which the boy stands to ground level or by debarking the girl from a breast-shaped UFO that scares the neighbors away. Another fictional element is Marilena's capacity of provoking short circuits, in moments in which she is very emotionally active (e.g., when Andrei touches her in the bar's restroom, or <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> neighborhood is cut from electricity when she cries near the high voltage electrical box).|$|E
