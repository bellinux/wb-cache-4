For these periods, the continuous measurements yielded an average 210 Pb activity concentration at ground level of 0. 57 mBq m - 3, and an average <b>total</b> 210 <b>Pb</b> <b>deposition</b> rate to ground of 180 Bq m - 2 year - 1. The average total deposition velocity, which relates the <b>total</b> 210 <b>Pb</b> <b>deposition</b> rate to the 210 Pb activity concentration was calculated to be 1. 0 cm s - 1. The variation of the data with time was studied by time-series analysis and distinct seasonal patterns were identified. Maximum 210 Pb activity concentrations in air are observed in the autumn and winter months (October through February) of each year. By contrast, the maximum 210 <b>Pb</b> <b>deposition</b> rate is observed during summer (June-August), i. e. in the months with the highest amount of rainfall at this site. Like the 210 <b>Pb</b> <b>deposition</b> rate, the <b>total</b> deposition velocity exhibits a seasonal pattern with maximum values in summer.

In the long-term, variations of approximately a factor of 2 were observed in the annual average 210 Pb activity concentrations, the annual deposition sums and the annual average deposition velocities.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{fractionation}} and elemental {{association of}} some heavy metals in air particulate matter {{from two different}} sources, a smelter and heavy vehicle traffic, were investigated using a continuous-flow sequential extraction procedure. Air particulate matter (a combination of wet and dry deposition) was collected monthly for one year and was analyzed by a four-step continuous-flow sequential extraction procedure employing a modified Tessier scheme. Examination of crustal enrichment factors (EF crust) suggested that the Cd, Zn and Pb in the air particulate matter were predominantly of anthropogenic origin. <b>Total</b> <b>Pb</b> <b>deposition</b> in the dry season {{was found to be}} higher than that in the wet season, and may be attributed to soil dust. However, the fractional distribution of metals between forms did not differ between seasons. The results showed that the reducible phase (Fe/Mn oxides) was the largest fraction of Pb in air particulate matter from both the smelter and heavy traffic sites. The overlain metal extraction profiles demonstrated a close elemental association between Al and Pb in the acid-soluble phase of air particulate matter. In the reducible fraction, Pb was found to dissolve earlier than Fe indicating that Pb could occur adsorbed onto Fe oxide surfaces in the air particulate matter...|$|R

Soluble and insoluble Pb forms were quantified in snow (vertical deposition), and rime (horizontal deposition). The objective was to compare Pb input fluxes into ecosystems via vertical and horizontal deposition, and to identify the residual Pb polution sources {{in an era of}} rapidly decreasing industrial pollution. Lead soluble in diluted HNO 3 made up 96 % of <b>total</b> <b>Pb</b> <b>deposition,</b> with the remaining 4 % Pb bound mainly in silicates. Four times higher concentrations of soluble Pb in rime than in snow, and 1. 6 times higher concentrations of insoluble Pb in rime than in snow were associated with slightly different Pb isotope ratios. On average, the 206 Pb/ 207 Pb ratios in rime were higher than those in snow. Higher 206 Pb/ 207 Pb ratios of insoluble Pb than in insoluble Pb may indicate an increasing role of geogenic Pb in recent atmospheric deposition. A distinct reversal to more radiogenic 206 Pb/ 207 Pb ratios in snow and rime in 2010, compared to literature data from rain-fed Shagnum peatlands (1800 - 2000 A. D.), documented a recent decrease in anthropogenic Pb in the atmosphere of Central Europe. Since the early 1980 s, Pb concentrations in snow decreased 18 times in the rural south of the Czech Republic, but only twice in the industrial north of the Czech Republic.

40|$|Background: Every {{five years}} since 1990, the European Heavy Metals in Mosses Survey {{provided}} data on atmospheric heavy metal bioaccumulations in mosses throughout Europe at a high spatial resolution. The moss data show the effectiveness of air quality control policies: for Germany the metal bioaccumulations decreased between 1990 and 2000, whilst they increased from 2000 to 2005. This investigation is intended {{to show how the}} moss data could be used to map atmospheric depositions of Cd and Pb, which later on might serve for the calculation of Critical Loads Exceedances. In addition, we compared how much heavy metal concentrations in mosses in Germany deviate from background data observed in Greenland. Methods: Mapping heavy metals with a high spatial resolution for the German territory was conducted according to the following methodology: EMEP deposition maps (50 km by 50 km spatial resolution) were intersected within a GIS with Kriging maps on Cd and Pb accumulations in mosses (EMEP (European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme) is a scientifically based and politically driven programme under the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution for international co-operation to solve transboundary air pollution problems). Subsequently, the statistical relations between the EMEP modelled depositions and the bioaccumulations in mosses were quantified by using regression analysis. The regression functions were used to transform the moss concentration maps into deposition maps. The resulting maps on Cd and <b>Pb</b> <b>depositions</b> have a spatial resolution of 5 km by 5 km and were added to the respective map on the residuals of the regression functions (Regression Kriging). Finally, the territory of Germany was extracted from the European maps on Cd and <b>Pb</b> <b>depositions</b> and the legends were adjusted accordingly in terms of n standard deviations from the German mean value. The concentrations of Al, As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mo, Pb, Sb, Sn, and Zn in the mosses sampled in 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005 in Germany were compared with background values derived from mosses sampled in north-eastern Greenland (Zackenberg Background Values). The differences between heavy metal concentrations in mosses in Germany and Greenland were calculated for the 16 federal states of Germany and mapped for Pb. Results and discussion: The regression models corroborate that the Cd concentration in mosses is correlated with the EMEP modelled total Cd deposition across Europe (regression coefficient according to Pearson, rp = 0. 67; regression coefficient according to Spearman, rs = 0. 69). The coefficient of determination is r 2 = 0. 44. The same is true for Pb with rp = 0. 76 and rs = 0. 77 and r 2 = 0. 58. Based on the regression models and the respective residuals, maps on the total deposition of Cd and Pb were calculated for the year 2005. The German mean value of <b>total</b> Cd and <b>Pb</b> <b>deposition</b> was 0. 342 g/ha/a (standard deviation 0. 08 g/ha/a and 8. 6 g/ha/a (standard deviation 2. 1 g/ha/a) respectively. The maps depict the spatial patterns of the <b>total</b> Cd and <b>Pb</b> <b>deposition</b> in terms of n standard deviations from the respective German wide mean value. The spatial resolution of the maps is 5 km × 5 km and reflects the mesh size of the moss monitoring net. Even today, the bioaccumulation of several metals in Germany still exceeds the background values observed in Greenland. This is true especially for Cd, Cr, Cu, Mo, Pb, Sb, Sn and Zn. Comparing the results of this investigation with those from other methods it can be concluded that the mean values calculated for the <b>total</b> Cd and <b>Pb</b> <b>deposition</b> for Germany differ from such assessed by deposition measurements and models.

Conclusions: In Germany, the moss measurement data provide a valuable tool at a high spatial resolution for the validation of modelling and mapping of atmospheric heavy metal deposition and should as such be used for this purpose. The comparison of the metal concentrations in mosses in Germany with the values found in Greenland indicate that atmospheric deposition of heavy metals in Germany is still considerably higher than the natural background deposition. ...|$|R

On the basis of Pb isotopic composition (e. g., 206 Pb/ 207 Pb), clear indications of Pb contamination during the pre-Roman/Roman, post-Roman and medieval periods were attributed to the mining and smelting of Pb ores from Britain and elsewhere in Europe. Between the 17 th and early 20 th centuries, during the industrial period, the mining and smelting of indigenous Scottish Pb ores {{were the most important}} sources of anthropogenic <b>Pb</b> <b>deposition</b> at three of the sites. In contrast, at the most southerly site, influences from the use of both British Pb ores and imported Australian Pb ores (in more southern parts of Britain) since the late 19 th century were evident. At each of the sites, Australian-Pb-influenced car exhaust emissions (from the 1930 s to late 1990 s), along with significant contributions from coal combustion (until the late 1960 s and onset of the postindustrial period), were evident. Atmospheric anthropogenic <b>Pb</b> <b>deposition</b> across Scotland was greatest (∼ 10 to 40 mg m− 2 a− 1) between the late 1880 s and late 1960 s, increasing southward, declining to 0. 44 to 5. 7 mg m− 2 a− 1 by the early 2000 s.

40|$|Surface {{enhanced}} Raman scattering (SERS) is {{a powerful}} means for obtaining vibrational data from the metal/electrolyte or metal/gas interfacial environment. However, SERS is only observed for {{a limited number of}} metal surfaces under certain experimental conditions. Before this method can become a universal tool, the enhancement mechanism(s) must be understood. The results reported in this dissertation assess both electronic and chemical contributions to the SERS mechanism. The electronic properties of the metal are altered by systematic <b>deposition</b> of <b>Pb</b> or Cu onto a substrate that supports intense SERS, Ag. The chemical nature of the interface is altered with different probe molecules. The effect of <b>Pb</b> <b>deposition</b> on the SERS enhancing ability of Ag electrodes has previously been investigated with strongly adsorbed probe molecules. The behavior of cyanide species in the presence of Pb⁺² is complicated by the necessity of maintaining low solution pH to prevent Pb(OH) ₂ precipitation; thus, the predominant solution species is HCN. Although previous reports state that no SERS can be detected from cyanide-containing solutions below pH 6, intense SERS signals can be obtained at pH 2 if sufficiently positive electrode potentials are maintained. The two unresolved SERS bands observed in acidic solutions are attributed to HCN which interacts with the Ag surface in end-on and side-on configurations. The predominant effect of <b>Pb</b> <b>deposition</b> on HCN SERS is HCN displacement. Enhancement due to charge transfer processes is not significant, while electromagnetic effects dictate the residual SERS intensity remaining after the initial HCN displacement. The supporting electrolyte anion affects the rate of change of the potential dependent C≡N stretch in basic CN⁻ media. A correlation between the rate of frequency change and anion charge/radius ratio was observed at potentials near and slightly negative of the Ag potential of zero charge in basic CN⁻ media. These results demonstrate the extraordinary sensitivity of SERS to interfacial conditions. The contributions from chemical and electromagnetic enhancement are further assessed by following excitation wavelength dependence of the SERS intensity of pyridine and Cl⁻ as a function of Cu coverage. Contributions from both are observed, but chemical enhancement is less evident for Cu than for <b>Pb</b> <b>deposition.</b> This is related to the smaller change in work function that occurs as a consequence of Cu versus <b>Pb</b> <b>deposition</b> on Ag surfaces...|$|R

Il est en effet important d’établir le degré et les causes éventuelles de dégradation de la qualité de ces eaux, compte tenu de leur usage à des fins tant domestiques qu’agricoles. Des résidus de traitement ont également été échantillonnés dans les haldes abandonnées. L’analyse des distributions et des variations spatio-temporelles des concentrations de Pb et As a permis de mettre en évidence que le centre minier a véritablement un impact sur la qualité des eaux de surface environnantes, malgré le caractère neutre à alcalin du drainage. Aucune ne rejoint les critères de l’Organisation mondiale de la santé en matière de Pb et As dans l’eau potable (10  µg/L), mais près de la moitié souscrit aux normes marocaines (50  µg/L). L’importance de la dégradation varie selon la saison et la localité, et le contraste entre sites a priori non dégradés et sites dégradés n’est pas toujours très prononcé. On observe même des variations à l’inverse des tendances attendues. Les résultats peuvent cependant être réconciliés en tenant compte de l’importance du transport particulaire par rapport au transport dissous au moment et au lieu de l’échantillonnage. Il appert que les minéralisations et les résidus miniers restés sur place peuvent constituer la principale source de pollution des eaux de surface de la région de Zeïda. The Upper Moulouya Basin was the location of extensive lead mining between 1930 and 1985, with three major operations near Aouli, Mibladen and Zeïda. The Moulouya drains about 7. 5 % of the Moroccan territory and provides drinking and irrigation water to many communities over its more than 500  km path. It is thus important to determine the impact of past mining activities on its water quality, since the mining sites were abandoned {{with little or no}} rehabilitation. This paper focuses on the Zeïda area, the uppermost of these mining centres on the Moulouya. About 630, 172  t of lead concentrates (40 ‑ 70 % Pb) were produced between 1972 and 1985 at Zeïda. Lead was mined from carbonate and sulphide mineral deposits (cerussite, 70 %; galena, 30 %) mixed with barite in stratiform ore bodies hosted by Permo-Triassic arkoses. Mining left 12  Mt and 70  Mt of tailings and wastes in fully exposed piles {{on each side of the}} Moulouya, as well as a dozen water-filled open-stopes. Mine drainage is of neutral pH, thanks to the low content of residual sulphide minerals and the availability of carbonate in the tailings and host rock. The river and some quarry-lakes are tapped to fulfill domestic, agricultural and stock-breeding needs. One lake is used to directly feed Zeïda’s water network (pop. 3, 000), without any water treatment. The Moulouya, upstream and downstream of Zeïda, and four lakes were sampled twice in 2002 (dry period: February; wet period: April). Temperature, electric conductivity (EC), Eh and pH were measured in the field. Samples were filtered through 0. 45  µm membranes. The filtrates were preserved with 4 % HNO 3 and kept at 4 °C until analysis. The filters and their particulate fraction, as well as a composite sample of the tailings, were dried and kept dry until dissolution and analysis. All measurements were performed by ICP-MS and capillary electrophoresis analyses. Lead and arsenic are well above « normal » concentrations in the tailings, at 5, 547  g/t and 192  g/t, respectively. These elements are clear threats to population health, since dust from unstabilized tailings can be dispersed by wind and rain waters, contaminating agricultural soils and surface waters, and eventually leading to cases of saturnism or arsenical intoxication in the population. All Pb and As concentrations measured in the waters sampled are above the World Health Organisation criteria for drinking water (10  µg/L for Pb and As). Nevertheless, about half of these measurements meet the Moroccan criteria (50  µg/L). All samples show near neutral or slightly basic pH values (7. 2 - 8. 9). EC is also high (>  1, 000  µS/cm). As and Pb are largely associated with the particulate fraction (>  80 % of <b>total</b> As and <b>Pb),</b> except for As in two lakes (<  40 %). Overall, their concentrations are higher in the Zeïda area than upstream in the Moulouya. However, this is a tendency rather than a rule, because the differences are often small (<  50 %) and suffer exceptions. For instance, Pb concentrations are 60 % lower than the so-called uncontaminated reference station, in two quarry-lakes sampled during the wet period. The occasional lack of significant and consistent contrast between an obviously degraded environment and a pristine site was unexpected. The results were therefore further investigated, in order to identify possible explanations for the apparent discrepancies. Coherency in the data set emerges when one considers the relative importance of dissolved and particulate transport in the various types of environments sampled. Using this interpretation scheme, EC is considered as an indicator of solute transportation, since EC is a function of dissolved ionic components. <b>Total</b> <b>Pb</b> is regarded as an indicator of particulate transportation, since Pb is strongly adsorbed to particulate substrates at the pH observed. Following these assumptions, particulate transport appears to dominate over dissolved transportation in the Moulouya. <b>Total</b> <b>Pb</b> increases by factors of 3. 4 and 9. 8 from dry to wet periods, whereas EC decreases by 0. 7 - 0. 8, as a result of rain dilution. In two of the four lakes, dissolved transport is comparatively more important, since EC does not change significantly and <b>total</b> <b>Pb</b> shows only a small increase from the dry to the wet period. In these lakes, the dissolved input during the rainy period appears to be large enough to keep EC at its previous value, without significant dilution, as opposed to what is going on in the Moulouya. In the two other lakes, both EC and <b>total</b> <b>Pb</b> decrease from the dry to the wet period, pointing to dilution effects greater than either dissolved or particulate mobilization. Apparent discrepancies in the intensity and direction of variations are explained when prevailing modes of dispersion are taken into account. For instance, the enrichment factor of <b>total</b> <b>Pb</b> in the Moulouya, downstream of Zeïda, jumps from 1. 1 (dry) to 3. 2 (wet), with respect to the reference station. Meanwhile, EC increases only from 1. 2 (dry) to 1. 5 (wet). The greater increase of <b>total</b> <b>Pb</b> over EC is explained by prevalent particulate transport. In another case, the enrichment of EC with respect to the reference station, in two lakes, increases from 14. 2 and 20. 4 (dry) to 20. 1 and 27. 9 (<b>wet)</b> while <b>total</b> <b>Pb</b> enrichment decreases from 2. 0 and 2. 0 (dry) to 1. 6 and 1. 3 (wet). Here, the prevalence of dissolved transport in these two lakes, combined with particulate transport at the reference station, allow for a strong increase in the EC parameter, concurrent with a weak increase in <b>total</b> <b>Pb.</b> Finally, in the lakes where both dissolved and particulate transport are presumably minor, <b>total</b> <b>Pb</b> undergoes enrichment with respect to the reference station, in the dry period (by 3. 4 and 1. 8), whereas depletion characterizes the wet period (0. 6 in both lakes). In this case, enrichment is likely the result of evaporation during the dry season, and depletion the result of dilution by rain during the wet period. These two types of lake behave differently because they are located next to residual mineral deposits (likely with more soluble phases), have short travel distances and thus fewer contacts with adsorbing substrates, which is not the case for the other two lakes...|$|R
40|$|Because it {{is unclear}} if {{leaching}} can account for differences in metal bioavailability observed between metal-spiked soils and historically contaminated field soils, we simultaneously assessed Pb toxicity to the springtail Folsomia candida in three transects of Pb-contaminated soils and in leached and unleached soils spiked at similar <b>total</b> <b>Pb</b> concentrations. <b>Total</b> <b>Pb</b> concentrations of 3, 877 mg/kg dry weight and higher always caused significant effects on F. candida reproduction in the spiked soils. In the transects, only the soil with the highest Pb concentration of 14, 436 mg/kg dry weight significantly affected reproduction. When expressed as pore-water concentrations, reproduction was never significantly affected at Pb concentrations of 0. 539 mg/L, whereas reproduction was always significantly affected at Pb concentrations of 0. 678 mg/L and higher, independent of the soil treatment. These results indicate that pore-water Pb concentrations can explain, at least in part, the observed differences in the toxicity data expressed as <b>total</b> <b>Pb</b> concentrations. Leaching after the spiking procedure only caused small differences in Pb toxicity and, therefore, cannot account for toxicity differences between laboratory-spiked soils and historically contaminated field soils...|$|R

Pollution of soil and plants along the highways and roads by Pb from automobile exhaust gases has extensively been reported as the most important pollutant source in the environment.

This large difference in nucleation properties between the two films is caused by differences in the critical island size, {{which in turn is}} caused by Quantum Size Effects (QSE). The 4 -layer film has a critical island size of 1 while the 5 -layer film has a critical island size of 5 or larger. This is a remarkable result because even at RT most metals have critical island sizes of 1. In deposition on top of 4 - and 5 -layer films at 110 K shows that the critical island size is 1 for both films but faster diffusion on the 5 -layer films results in a 2 times difference in island density, this too is attributed to QSE.

40|$|Abstract This study {{investigated}} the impacts of two best management practices (BMPs) recommended by US Environmental Protection Agency on Pb weather-ing and leachability in shooting range soils. The two BMPs included replacing soil berm with sand berm and periodically removing bullets or shot from a berm. A column experiment corresponding to the first BMP was conducted by mixing the bullets with sand/soil, or placing bullets {{on the surface of}} sand/soil. After a 16 – 18 -week incubation under high or low rainfall simu-lations, <b>total</b> <b>Pb</b> concentrations in sand were lower than that in soil. <b>Total</b> leachable <b>Pb</b> in sand (8. 48 and 5. 52 μgkg− 1) was also lower than that in soil (60. 0 and 30. 4 μgkg− 1) when bullets were mixed with sand/soil; however, they were comparable when bullets were placed on the sand/soil surface. These results indicate that lower Pb concentration in the sand than in soil may be attributed to reduced weathering of bullets. Mechanical removal of Pb bullets in the field trans-ferred Pb from large to finer particles, increasing <b>total</b> <b>Pb</b> in the soil (< 2 mm) from 2, 170 to 5, 000 mgkg− 1. In contrast, mechanical removal of Pb shot effectively re-duced the shot in the soil by 86 – 92 %. Thus, we con-cluded that, while replacing soil berm with sand berm can slow down Pb weathering, it may increase Pb leach-ability in the long term. Removal of Pb bullets and Pb shot can be effective, but caution needs to be exercised to minimize the adverse impacts, especially in pistol/rifle ranges because of increased <b>total</b> <b>Pb</b> content in the soil...|$|R
40|$|The {{surfaces}} of Sphagnum carpets were marked with plastic mesh {{and one year}} later the production of plant matter was harvested in four ombrotrophic bogs from two regions of southern Germany: Upper Bavaria (Oberbayern, OB) and the Northern Black Forest (Nordschwarzwald, NBF). Radioactive, 210 Pb was determined in solid samples using ultralow background gamma spectrometry while <b>total</b> <b>Pb</b> concentrations and stable isotopes (206 Pb, 207 Pb, 208 Pb) were determined in acid digests using ICP-SMS. Up to 12 samples (40 x 40 cm) were collected per site, and 6 to 10 sites investigated per bog. The greatest variations within a given sampling site were in the range 212 - 532 Bq kg- 1 for 210 Pb activity, whereas 206 Pb/ 207 Pb and 208 Pb/ 206 Pb varied less than 1 %. The median values of all parameters for the sites (6 - 10 per bog) were not significantly different. The median activities of 210 Pb (Bq kg- 1) in the mosses collected from the bogs in NBF (HO = 372 ± 56, n= 55; WI = 342 ± 58, n= 93) were slightly less from those in OB (GS = 394 ± 50, n= 55; KL = 425 ± 58, n= 24). However, the mosses in the NBF bogs exhibited much greater productivity (187 to 202 g m- 2 a- 1) compared to those of OB (71 to 91 g m- 2 a- 1), and this has {{a profound impact on}} the accumulation rates of 210 Pb (Bq m- 2 a- 1), with the bogs in the NBF yielding fluxes (HO = 73 ± 30; WI = 65 ± 20) which are twice those of OB (GS = 29 ± 11; KL = 40 ± 13). Using the air concentrations of 210 Pb measured at Schauinsland (SIL) in the southern Black Forest and average annual precipitation, the atmospheric fluxes of 210 Pb at SIL (340 Bq m- 2 a- 1) exceeds the corresponding values obtained from the mosses by a factor of five, providing the first quantitative estimate of the retention efficiency of 210 Pb by Sphagnum. When the 210 Pb activities of all moss samples are combined (n= 227), a significant decrease with increasing plant production rate is observed; in contrast, <b>total</b> <b>Pb</b> concentrations show the opposite trend. The contrasting behaviour of 210 <b>Pb</b> and <b>total</b> <b>Pb</b> in the mosses may reflect differences in the particle size distribution of the corresponding aerosols, their physical and chemical properties, the extent of their interaction with plant surfaces, or some combination of these factors. The 206 Pb/ 207 Pb ratios from NBF (HO = 1. 159 ± 0. 002, n= 19; WI = 1. 157 ± 0. 003, n= 48) and OB (GS = 1. 157 ± 0. 003, n= 28; KL = 1. 159 ± 0. 003, n= 15) are uniform, indicating that both regions are impacted by Pb from predominately anthropogenic sources. Although Sphagnum moss represents an established receptor in monitoring atmospheric <b>Pb</b> <b>deposition,</b> the physical characteristics (size, morphology, composition) of the three predominant kinds of Pb-bearing aerosols considered here, namely 210 Pb (adsorbed onto aerosol surfaces, following decay of 222 Rn), anthropogenic Pb (sub-micron aerosols from high temperature combustion processes) and soilderived mineral dusts (tens of microns, from chemical weathering of crustal rocks), are fundamentally different and these have consequences for the retention efficiency of the three kinds of particles.

In this study, the isotopically exchangeable Pb concentration in soils (E-value) was measured using a stable isotope (²⁰⁸Pb). Soils were collected at three industrialized sites where historical Pb emissions have resulted in elevated Pb concentrations in the surrounding soil. Lead concentrations ranged from background values, in the control soils collected far from the emission source, to highly elevated concentrations (5460 – 14440 mg Pb kg⁻¹). The control soil of each site was amended in the laboratory with Pb(NO₃) ₂ to the same <b>total</b> <b>Pb</b> concentrations as the field-contaminated soils. The %E values (E-value relative to <b>total</b> <b>Pb</b> content) were greater than 84 % in the laboratory-amended soils, and ranged from 45 % to 78 % (mean 58 %) in the field-contaminated soils. The relatively large labile fractions of Pb in the field-contaminated soils show that the majority of Pb is reversibly bound {{despite the fact that the}} binding strength is large. The Pb concentrations in soil solution were up to 3500 -fold larger for the laboratory-amended soils than for field-contaminated soils at corresponding <b>total</b> <b>Pb</b> concentrations.

One of its core tasks is to organise interlaboratory comparisons (ILCs) among appointed National Reference Laboratories (NRLs). This report {{presents the results}} of the tenth ILC of the EU-RL-HM which focused on the determination of total arsenic, cadmium, mercury and lead in vegetable food. The test material used in this exercise was the Standard Reference Material SRM 1570 a, spinach leaves of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The material was rebottled and relabelled to prevent recognition by the participants and was dispatched at the beginning of June. Each participant received one bottle containing approximately 15 g of test material. Thirty-five laboratories from 24 countries registered to the exercise of which 35 reported results for total Cd and <b>total</b> <b>Pb,</b> 32 for <b>total</b> As and 31 for total Hg. The assigned values for total As, Cd and Hg are the certified values taken from the SRM 1570 a certificate. For <b>total</b> <b>Pb,</b> the "information value" provided by NIST in the SRM certificate was used as assigned value. The uncertainties of the assigned values (uref) for total As, Cd and Hg, were taken directly from the CRM certificate as provided by the producer. No uref is provided by NIST for the <b>total</b> <b>Pb</b> concentration because the <b>total</b> <b>Pb</b> content is only provided as "information value". Participants were invited to report the uncertainty of their measurements. This was done by the majority of the laboratories taking part in this exercise. Laboratories' results were rated with z- and zeta-scores for total As, Cd, and Hg in accordance to ISO 13528. No zeta-scores were given for <b>total</b> <b>Pb</b> because uref was not known for that measurand. The standard deviation for proficiency assessment (also called target standard deviation) was fixed to 15 % for all the measurands by the advisory board of this ILC, {{on the basis of the}} outcome of previous ILCs organised by the EU-RL-HM and on the state-of-the-art in this field of analysis. More than 80 % of the participants performed satisfactory for total Cd and Hg.

Subsequently, the statistical relations between the EMEP modelled depositions and the bioaccumulations in mosses were quantified by using regression analysis. The regression functions were used to transform the moss concentration maps into deposition maps. The resulting maps on Cd and <b>Pb</b> <b>depositions</b> have a spatial resolution of 5 km by 5 km and {{were added to the}} respective map on the residuals of the regression functions (Regression Kriging).

Since the mid- 1980 s, fluxes of Pb decreased (4 − 7 fold) more rapidly than those of As and Sb (2 − 3 fold), attributable to both the gradual elimination of leaded gasoline and recent new sources of the latter elements.

Sampling campaigns were achieved in representative weather conditions, on an 8 -h basis. Dry deposition rates measured downwind from refinery emissions (≈ 102 - 10 3 μgPbm- 2 h- 1), cross-sectionally in a 3 - 5 km radius area around the plant, represent 10 - 100 times the urban background dry fallout, measured upwind, as well as fallout measured near other potential sources of anthropogenic Pb. The Pb-Zn refinery isotopic signature (approx. 1. 100 < 206 Pb/ 207 Pb< 1. 135) is made identifiable, using the same set of Pb and Zn ores for 2 days before sampling and during field experiments, by agreement with the executive staff of the plant. This source signature is less radiogenic than signatures of urban background Pb aerosols (1. 155 < 206 Pb/ 207 Pb< 1. 165) and minor sources of Pb aerosols (1. 147 < 206 Pb/ 207 Pb< 1. 165). By a simple binary mixing model calculation, we established the extension of the industrial <b>Pb</b> <b>deposition</b> plume. Fifty to eighty percents of total lead settled by the dry deposition mode, 3 - 4 km away from the refinery, still have an industrial origin. That represents from 40 to 80 μgPbm- 2 h- 1, in an area where the blood lead level exceeds 100 μgPbl- 1 for 30 % of men and 12 % of women living there.

Here, a complex colluvial soil formed {{over the last}} 10, 000 years in NW Spain is studied. The objective is to evaluate the behavior of Pb in soils, including its migration rates and the potential use of complex soils as archives of atmospheric Pb pollution. To this end, Pb concentrations and Pb isotope ratios for total soil, and for acid-extractable (0. 5 M HNO 3) and residual fractions were determined. We show that the acid-extractable fraction is more radiogenic than the residual one {{in most of the}} soil profile and that this relationship is reversed in the surface layers (< 15 cm) where pollution is greatest. Radiogenic Pb seems to have been leached out during rock weathering and pedogenesis of the soil.
