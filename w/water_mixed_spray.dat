40|$|Abstract — Salt spray {{test chamber}} {{comprises}} {{of a test}} specimen mounted in it & secured in a tightly closed space for testing under corrosive environmental conditions. A fog assembly consisting of nozzle and valve is used to control and adjust the velocity and quantity of salt <b>mixed</b> <b>water</b> <b>spray.</b> The test specimen kept inside the inner tank is exposed to corrosive conditions. Thus we can obtain performance of specimen under the desirable corrosive conditions. We have optimized {{the weight of a}} 900 mm× 450 mm× 450 mm salt spray test chamber. The working temperature range for our salt spray test chamber is from ambient temperature upto 50 ْ C. The company is presently using stainless steel frame for inner tank support. We have changed the material from stainless steel to Hard PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride). Thus we have tried to use possible optimum solution for the design and manufacturing process, thereby we have reduced weight and simultaneously cost also...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{performed}} two {{experiments on}} resist-coated wafers. In {{the measurement of}} the resist-wafer adhesivity, we confirmed that it is significantly increased by an HMDS layer in between. In the resist-removal experiment using steam-water <b>mixed</b> <b>spray,</b> {{we found that the}} area of resist removal is limited within the area of spray application if HMDS is used, otherwise the former can be larger than the latter. These results suggest that the resist removal from a wafer surface by steam-water <b>mixed</b> <b>spray</b> is essentially a peel-off process...|$|R

Magnesium oxide (MgO) is a category of the practical semiconductor metal oxides, which is extensively used as catalyst and optical material. In the present study, MgO nanoparticles were successfully synthesized using a solvent <b>mixed</b> <b>spray</b> pyrolysis. The X-ray diffraction pattern confirmed the formation of MgO phase with an excellent crystalline structure. Debye-Scherrer equation {{is used for the}} determination of particle size, which was found to be 9. 2 [*]nm. Tunneling electron microscope analysis indicated that the as-synthesized particles are nanoparticles with an average particle size of 9 [*]nm. Meanwhile, the ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy of the resulting product was evaluated to study its optical property via measurement of the band gap energy value...|$|R

50|$|Gasoline engines can run at {{stoichiometric}} air-to-fuel ratio, because {{gasoline is}} quite volatile and is <b>mixed</b> (<b>sprayed</b> or carburetted) {{with the air}} prior to ignition. Diesel engines, in contrast, run lean, with more air available than simple stoichiometry would require. Diesel fuel is less volatile and is effectively burned as it is injected, leaving less time for evaporation and mixing. Thus, it would form soot (black smoke) at stoichiometric ratio.|$|R

The <b>water</b> <b>mixing</b> ratio in methanol was varied from 0 to 30 % by weight. Experiments at various excess air ratios were caried out under a constant charging efficiency and engine speed. The mean burning gas temperature in a cylinder was measured with a platinum wire resistor thermometer fixed near the cylinder head. When the excess air ratio was decreased or the amount of <b>water</b> <b>mixed</b> in methanol was increased, the mean temperature in the cylinder decreased and the ratio of burned fuel to supplied fuel decreased. In order to facilitate fuel vaporization, the air fuel mixture was heated, which resulted in an increase in thermal efficiency...|$|R
