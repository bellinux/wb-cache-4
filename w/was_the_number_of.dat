5|$|A {{particular}} {{feature of}} the meeting at Peterloo <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> women present. Female reform societies had been formed in North West England during June and July 1819, the first in Britain. Many {{of the women were}} dressed distinctively in white, and some formed all-female contingents, carrying their own flags. Of the 654recorded casualties, at least 168 were women, four of whom died either at St Peter's Field or later {{as a result of their}} wounds. It has been estimated that less than 12 per cent of the crowd was made up of women, suggesting that they were at significantly greater risk of injury than men by a factor of almost 3:1. Richard Carlile claimed that the women were especially targeted, a view apparently supported by the large number who suffered from wounds caused by weapons.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to Galaxy Game and Computer Space, numerous other games have been directly inspired by Spacewar. These include Orbitwar (1974, PLATO network computers), Space Wars (1977, arcade), and Space War (1978, Atari 2600). Additionally, in Asteroids (1979), designer Ed Logg used elements from Spacewar, namely the hyperspace button {{and the shape}} of the player's ship. Products as late as the 1990 computer game Star Control drew direct inspiration from Spacewar. Russell has been quoted as saying that the aspect of the game that he was most pleased with <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> other programmers it inspired to write their own games without feeling restricted to using Russell's own code or design.|$|E

5|$|The two-player {{game has}} the players {{engaged in a}} dogfight between two spaceships set against the {{backdrop}} of a randomly generated background starfield. The game was developed to meet three precepts: to use as much of the computer's resources as possible, to be consistently interesting and therefore have every run be different, and to be entertaining and therefore a game. The game was a multiplayer game because the computer had no resources left over to handle controlling the other ship. After the game's initial development, members of the TMRC worked to improve the game, adding an accurate starfield and a gravitational body, and spread it to the couple dozen other institutions with a PDP-1, a process which continued over the next few years. As the computer was uncomfortable to use for extended periods of time, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early gamepad. Spacewar was reportedly used as a smoke test by DEC technicians on new PDP-1 systems before shipping, since it was the only available program that exercised every aspect of the hardware. Although the game was widespread for the era, it was still very limited in its direct reach: the PDP-1 was priced at US$120,000 and only 55 were ever sold, many without a monitor, which prohibited Spacewar or any game of the time from reaching beyond a narrow, academic audience. Russell has been quoted as saying that the aspect of the game that he was most pleased with <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> other programmers it inspired to write their own games.|$|E

25|$|In Series Two, some cast changes occurred. David Jackson (Gan) was {{not upset}} that his {{character}} would die because Jackson was given {{little to do}} in many episodes.

When Boucher queried the note, Jackson explained that 'four' <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> lines he had in that week's script.

25|$|Following the 1868–1878 {{rebellion}} of the Ten Years' War, all {{slavery was}} abolished by 1886, making Cuba the second-to-last {{country in the}} Western Hemisphere to abolish slavery, with Brazil being the last. Instead of blacks, slave traders looked for others sources of cheap labour, such as Chinese colonists and Indians from Yucatán. Another feature of the population <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> Spanish-born colonists, known as peninsulares, who were mostly adult males; they constituted between ten and twenty per cent of the population between {{the middle of the}} 19th century and the great depression of the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|From 1847 to 1850, California had {{military}} governors {{appointed by}} the senior military commander in California.

Polk in office from March 4, 1845 – March 4, 1849, {{tried to get the}} 1848 Congress to make California a territory with a territorial government and again in 1849 but was unsuccessful in getting Congress to agree on the specifics of how this was to be done—the issue <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> free states vs. slave states.|$|E

25|$|A {{repeated}} problem <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> authorities {{responsible for}} {{different aspects of}} the river. The Drainage Board created in 1918 had no powers to address navigation issues, and there were six bodies responsible for the river below Denver in 1913. When the Great Ouse Catchment Board was created under the powers of the Land Drainage Act in 1930, effective action could at last be taken. There was significant sugar beet traffic on the river between 1925 and 1959, with the last known commercial traffic occurring in 1974. Leisure boating had been popular since 1904, and the post-war period saw the creation of the Great Ouse Restoration Society in 1951, who campaigned for complete renovation of the river. It was re-opened to Bedford in 1978, and is now managed by the Environment Agency.|$|E
25|$|Until March 2008, the International Tennis Federation (ITF), Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), Women's Tennis Association (WTA), Grand Slam Committee, {{and several}} {{individual}} tournaments had conflicting rules on how Hawk-Eye {{was to be}} utilised. A key example of this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> challenges a player was permitted per set, which varied among events. Some tournaments allowed players a greater margin for error, with players allowed an unlimited numbers of challenges {{over the course of}} a match. In other tournaments players received two or three per set. On 19 March 2008, the aforementioned organizing bodies announced a uniform system of rules: three unsuccessful challenges per set, with an additional challenge if the set reaches a tiebreak. In an advantage set (a set with no tiebreak) players are allowed three unsuccessful challenges every 12 games. The next scheduled event on the men and women's tour, the 2008 Sony Ericsson Open, was the first event to implement these new, standardized rules.|$|E
25|$|The Women's Little 500 is {{a bicycle}} race held {{annually}} at Bill Armstrong Stadium {{on the campus}} of Indiana University Bloomington. The race is modelled after the men's Little 500. The race has been run the Friday before the men's race, since its conception in 1988. It consists of half the distance of the men's race: 100 laps (25.49 miles) around the quarter-mile cinder track (410-meters) at the Bill Armstrong Stadium. Racers usually compete in teams of four, but teams can be as few as two, as long as that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> team members with which they qualified for the race. These teams usually have a common bond such as living in the same residence hall or being members of the same sorority, or they simply are an independent group with common interests. Each team is only given two bikes on which to ride and therefore, must compete in a relay-style that is rare in other races.|$|E
