5|$|A {{particularly}} damning {{piece of}} evidence came from a bonnetmaker named Maria Durden <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> court that Webster had visited her {{a week before the}} murder and had said {{that she was going to}} Birmingham to sell some property, jewellery and a house that her aunt had left her. The jury interpreted this as a sign that Webster had premeditated the murder and convicted her after deliberating for about an hour and a quarter.|$|E
5|$|An early {{draft of}} the {{screenplay}} was written by Chris Conkling, <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> bulk of the story in flashback, from Merry Brandybuck's point of view. After Bakshi and Zaentz saw Conkling's first draft, fantasy author Peter S. Beagle was called in for a rewrite. According to the website of publisher Conlan Press, Beagle wrote multiple drafts of the script for only $5,000, {{on the strength of}} promises from Saul Zaentz to hire him for other, better-paying projects afterward. Zaentz later reneged on these promises.|$|E

5|$|Shooting for {{the film}} was {{conducted}} in Kota, Jakarta, and Semarang, Central Java, {{over a period of}} one month. Soeriaatmadja later recalled that the most difficult scenes to shoot were those which happened in modern times, especially the riots; for set design, however, Indra Tamoron Musu found those that occurred in the past to be the most difficult, owing to the research necessary. The scenes at the house were shot separately; those occurring in 1998 were shot first and those occurring in the past were shot after the crew had spent a week renovating the house. Hasiholan later recalled that Soeriaatmadja was a controlling director <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> actors exactly what he wanted in a clear manner. However, cinematographer Ical Tanjung said that Soeriaatmadja was still open to feedback from the cast and crew. Editing, which was done by Waluyo Ichwandiardono, took another three months.|$|E
5|$|The Griffins, the Swansons, and Quagmire {{prepare for}} a road trip, ostensibly for a {{vacation}} in Maine. Quagmire distracts Bonnie and Lois as Peter alters course to Virginia instead. The group arrives at a bar in Stoolbend, Virginia, and discover that it was Cleveland <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> bartender the joke. Peter asks Cleveland where he first heard the joke, and Cleveland reveals that a Washington, D.C., bellhop named Sal Russo told it to him. The group sets out for D.C. with Cleveland in tow. They are attacked by a black car, whose occupants fire guns at them {{to prevent them from}} learning the joke's origin. Joe shoots out one of the car's tires, causing it to spin out of control and flip onto its roof. The Quahog group arrive at a Washington hotel and locate Sal, who is reluctant to reveal the source of the joke. He races away on a handcart through Washington. Losing track of Sal, they are soon captured by several men in black suits who pistol-whip them until they are unconscious.|$|E
25|$|Before European contact (until in the 1800s), {{the history}} of the Yup'ik, like that of other Alaska Natives, was oral history. Each society or village had storytellers (qulirarta) who were known for their memories, and those were the people <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> young about the group's history. Their stories (traditional legends qulirat and {{historical}} narratives qanemcit) express crucial parts of Alaska's earliest history.|$|E

After analysing the footage police recreated the journey there and back several times. They found that Mr Gilroy had taken 2 hours longer than their average time each way. Furthermore, {{a comparison of}} fuel consumption suggested that 124 miles of Mr Gilroy's journey were unaccounted for.|$|E

25|$|On 23 February 2012, the {{advocate}} depute led evidence from a Lothian and Borders Police constable <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> court {{that they had}} {{enlisted the help of}} specially trained cadaver dogs from South Yorkshire Police to search the offices where David Gilroy and Suzanne Pilley worked. The dogs were specially trained to smell for blood and human remains. The court was told that the dogs, springer spaniels, had identified three areas of interest; one in the basement area of the offices, and two in the boot of David Gilroy's silver Vauxhall Vectra.|$|E
25|$|On 6 March 2012, {{the court}} {{heard from a}} {{forensic}} scientist, Kirsty McTurk, <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> trial that she had conducted a search for DNA in Ms Pilley's workplace and in the boot of Mr Gilroy's car. She confirmed {{that she had been}} unable to find any trace of Ms Pilley's DNA anywhere in the building or in the car. She told the court that as she opened the boot to Mr Gilroy's car, she noticed a fresh smell coming from inside. She told the advocate depute that it could either have been an 'air freshener' or a 'cleansing agent'.|$|E
25|$|Wang sent {{messengers}} issuing pardons {{in hopes}} of causing these rebels to disband. Once the messengers returned to the Xin capital Chang'an, some honestly reported that the rebels gathered because the harsh laws {{made it impossible for}} them to make a living and therefore they were forced to rebel. Some, in order to flatter Wang Mang, told him that these were simply evil resistors who needed to be killed, or that this was a temporary phenomenon. Wang listened to those who flattered him and generally relieved those <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> truth from their posts. Further, Wang made no further attempts to pacify the rebels, but instead decided to suppress them by force. In reality, the rebels were forced into rebellion to survive, and they were hoping that eventually, when the famine was over, they could return home to farm. As a result, they never dared to attack cities.|$|E

25|$|In 2009 a {{group of}} British doctors who had not {{had access to the}} evidence, {{including}} Michael Powers who is a doctor, barrister and former coroner, challenged Hutton's verdict, offering their opinion based on published reports that {{the cause of death was}} untenable; they argued that the artery is small and difficult to access, and severing it would not have triggered sufficient blood loss to cause death. This opinion was challenged by several forensic pathologists who also had not had access to the evidence, <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>The</b> Guardian that the combination of Kelly's heart disease and the overdose would have meant a smaller loss of blood could have killed him than would be needed to kill a healthier person. In August 2010 the former leader of the Conservative Party, Michael Howard, called for a full inquest, and Dominic Grieve, the Attorney General for England and Wales, confirmed that he was considering re-opening it.|$|E

After it was revealed to Palin that the call was a prank, she handed the phone to one of her assistants <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> comedy duo [...] "I have to let you go" [...] and hung up.|$|E

Five's controller Richard Woolfe stated: [...] "There's an explosion in musical performance groups and Don't Stop Believing will tap into that exciting groundswell."

A number of setbacks plagued the defense, including the May 6 suicide of Wise's sister-in-law, Edith Hasel, and the subsequent collapse of her husband Fred Hasel, both of whom had been prepared to testify for the defense; the recantation of testimony by a man named Frank Metzger, <b>who</b> <b>told</b> <b>the</b> prosecution on cross-examination that the defense had asked him to perjure himself to support claims that Wise was insane; and Wise's choice to take the stand on her own behalf.
