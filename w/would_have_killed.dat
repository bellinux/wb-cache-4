5|$|Between {{chapters}} in which Penelope is narrating, the twelve maids speak on topics from their point-of-view. They lament their childhood as slaves with no parents or playtime, sing of freedom, and {{dream of being}} princesses. They contrast their lives to Telemachus' and wonder if they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> him as a child if they knew he would kill them as a young man. They blame Penelope and Eurycleia for allowing them to unjustly die. In Hades, they haunt both Penelope and Odysseus.|$|E
5|$|Sheila {{was found}} {{on the floor of the}} master bedroom with her mother. She was in her nightdress, her feet were bare, and she had two bullet wounds under her chin, one of them on her throat. The pathologist, Dr Peter Vanezis, said that the lower of the {{injuries}} had occurred from three inches (76mm) away, and that the higher one was a contact injury. The higher of the two <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> her immediately. The lower injury <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> her too, he said, but not necessarily straight away. Vanezis testified that it would be possible for a person with such an injury to stand up and walk around, but the lack of blood on her nightdress suggested to him that she had not done this. He believed that the lower of her injuries had happened first, because it had caused bleeding inside the neck; the court heard that if the immediately fatal wound had happened first, the bleeding would not have occurred to the same extent. Vanesiz said that the pattern of bloodstains on her nightdress suggested she had been sitting up when she received both injuries.|$|E
5|$|Mulder—on {{his way to}} England {{investigating}} heart chakra-shaped crop circles—calls Scully {{and asks}} her to meet a contact of his, Colleen Azar (Colleen Flynn), to obtain some information. As Scully speaks to Mulder on her cellphone while driving her car, a woman appears on a crosswalk. Scully brakes hard to avoid hitting the woman. As she does so, she narrowly avoids colliding with a diesel truck. She realizes that, had the woman not stepped in her path, the truck <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> her. When she later arrives {{at the house of}} Azar, she observes that Scully is going through a personal crisis and tries to offer her guidance, but Scully is dismissive.|$|E

Brown quickly dismisses the possibility of Drage <b>having</b> <b>killed</b> Merton, leaving Drage shocked at Brown's statement that he had needed the victim and <b>would</b> never <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> him.|$|R

5|$|Despite Sheila's erratic mental state, her {{psychiatrist}} {{told the}} court {{that the kind of}} violence necessary to commit the murders was not consistent with his view of her. In particular, {{he said he did not}} believe she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> her father or children, because her difficult relationship was confined to her mother. Her ex-husband said the same: that, despite her tendency to throw things and sometimes hit him, she had never harmed the children. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, testified that Sheila was not a violent person and that she had never known her to use a gun; June's niece, Ann Eaton, {{told the court}} that Sheila did not know how to use one. Bamber disputed this, telling police on the night of the shooting, as they stood outside the house, that he and Sheila had gone target shooting together. He acknowledged later that he had not seen her fire a gun as an adult.|$|E
5|$|Miss Foster accelerates her plans, {{knowing that}} the Doctor will attempt to stop her. Throughout London, the Adipose begin to spawn and soon number several thousand. The Doctor and Donna prevent total {{emergency}} parthenogenesis occurring, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> those who had taken the pill, and {{the remainder of the}} young Adipose make their way to Adipose Industries. The Adiposian First Family arrive in a spaceship and begin collecting their young. The Doctor tries to warn Miss Foster about her safety, but she disregards him and is killed when the Adipose drop her from their transport beam to her death, to cover their unsanctioned colonization efforts. The Doctor refrains from killing the young Adipose because they are children, to which Donna remarks that his previous companion Martha Jones made him more human.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, 24 September 1917, a British patrol {{reached the}} crash site. Documents in Voss' pocket identified him. A military doctor cursorily examined the corpse. He noted three bullet wounds. One ranged slightly upward through the chest cavity {{from right to}} left, consistent with Hoidge's angle of fire; it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> Voss {{in less than a}} minute. The other two gunshot wounds pierced Voss's abdomen from rear to front, coinciding with Rhys-Davids's firing angle. Werner Voss was buried like any other dead soldier near Plum Farm, laid in a shell crater without coffin or honors. His grave's location was recorded as Map Sheet 28, coordinates 24.C.8.3. The field grave would subsequently be lost trace of, through the turmoil of ongoing ground fighting.|$|E

5|$|While Walter and Agent Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) {{ensure that}} the witness is safe at the hospital, Olivia takes Peter back to the lab. Peter, {{suffering}} from a headache, takes an aspirin and drinks out of what he believes to be an ordinary bottle of milk from the fridge. In reality, the milk contains a serum developed by Walter {{in order to help}} him recover his full mental function. However, the serum was incorrectly prepared, which causes Peter to begin convulsing. Over the phone, Walter directs Olivia to inject Peter with the correct compounds in order to save his life. Walter realizes that the serum <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> him if he had consumed it, and that this was another step in the Observer's plot. Later that evening, September meets with another Observer, and identifies the fact that Walter was able to let Peter go, despite believing that he may not survive, and that when the time comes, they can expect Walter to do it again.|$|E
5|$|The Chicxulub Crater lends {{support to}} the theory {{postulated}} by the late physicist Luis Alvarez and his son, geologist Walter Alvarez, that the extinction of numerous animal and plant groups, including non-avian dinosaurs, may have resulted from a bolide impact (the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event). Luis and Walter Alvarez, at the time both faculty members at the University of California, Berkeley, postulated that this enormous extinction event, which was roughly contemporaneous with the postulated date of formation for the Chicxulub crater, could {{have been caused by}} just such a large impact. The age of the rocks marked by the impact shows that this impact structure dates from roughly 66 million years ago, the end of the Cretaceous period, and the start of the Paleogene period. It coincides with the K–Pg boundary, the geological boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene. The impact associated with the crater is thus implicated in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, including the worldwide extinction of non-avian dinosaurs. This conclusion has been the source of controversy. In March 2010, 41 experts from many countries reviewed the available evidence: 20 years' worth of data spanning a variety of fields. They concluded that the impact at Chicxulub triggered the mass extinctions at the K–Pg boundary. In 2013 a study compared isotopes in impact glass from the Chicxulub impact with the same isotopes in ash from the boundary where the extinction event occurred in the fossil record; the study concluded that the impact glasses were dated at 66.038 ± 0.049 Ma, and the deposits immediately above the discontinuity in the geological and fossil record was dated to 66.019 ± 0.021 Ma, the two dates being within 19,000 years of each other, or almost exactly the same within experimental error. The theory is now widely accepted by the scientific community. Some critics, including paleontologist Robert Bakker, argue that such an impact <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> frogs as well as dinosaurs, yet the frogs survived the extinction event. Gerta Keller of Princeton University argues that recent core samples from Chicxulub prove the impact occurred about 300,000 years before the mass extinction, and thus could not have been the causal factor. However, this conclusion is unsupported by radioactive dating and sedimentology.|$|E

25|$|Three {{minutes after}} the blast, {{hundreds}} of angry residents gathered at the scene and confronted the undercover soldiers. The soldiers fired live rounds at the ground and into the air to keep people back. The crowd kept drawing back and moving forward again until 9:50, when the RUC arrived and began firing plastic bullets at the protesters. Two women were wounded by plastic bullets and the undercover soldiers then fled in unmarked cars, setting off crackers or fireworks at the same time. Sinn Féin councillor Francie Molloy claimed that the protesters forced the SAS to withdraw, saving Doris's life in the process. Witnesses allegedly feared an undercover soldier brandishing a pistol <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> the wounded Doris with a shot to his head.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} idea {{was for a}} dog to carry a bomb strapped to its body, and reach a specific static target. The dog would then release the bomb by pulling with its teeth a self-releasing belt {{and return to the}} operator. The bomb could then be detonated either by a timer or remote control, though the latter was too rare and expensive at the time to be used. A group of dogs practiced this for six months, but the reports show that no dogs could master the task. They performed well on a single target but became confused after the target or location was changed and often returned to the operator with the bomb unreleased, which in a live situation <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> both the dog and the operator.|$|E

25|$|During {{the prelude}} to war, a hastily created 86-man Marine {{detachment}} under Lieutenant Israel Greene was detached to arrest John Brown at Harper's Ferry in 1859, after the abolitionist raided the armory there. Command of the mission was given to then-Colonel Robert E. Lee and his aide, Lieutenant J.E.B. Stuart, both having been on leave in Washington when President James Buchanan ordered Brown arrested. The ninety Marines arrived to the town on 17 October via train, and quickly surrounded John Brown's Fort. Upon his refusal to surrender, the Marines stormed the building with bayonets, battering down the door with hammers and a ladder used as a battering ram. Greene slashed Brown twice and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> him had his sword not bent on his last thrust; in his haste he had carried his light dress sword instead of his regulation sword.|$|E

Thor {{says that he is}} unable to say he did well, noting that he is particularly annoyed that Útgarða-Loki will now speak negatively about him. Útgarða-Loki points out that the group has left his keep and says that he hopes that they never return to it, for if he had an inkling of what he was dealing with he would never have allowed the group to enter in the first place. Útgarða-Loki reveals that all was not what it seemed to the group. Útgarða-Loki was in fact the immense Skrýmir, and that if the three blows Thor attempted to land had hit their mark, the first <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> Skrýmir. In reality, Thor's blows were so powerful that they had resulted in three square valleys.|$|E
25|$|In {{this short}} story, {{a man named}} Gunnar was {{suspected}} of manslaughter and escaped to Sweden, where Gunnar became acquainted with this young priestess.

When Gunnar had promised this, a demon jumped out of the god effigy and so Freyr was nothing but a piece of wood. Gunnar destroyed the wooden idol and dressed himself as Freyr, then Gunnar and the priestess travelled across Sweden where people were happy to see the god visiting them. After a while he made the priestess pregnant, but this was seen by the Swedes as confirmation that Freyr was truly a fertility god and not a scam. Finally, Gunnar had to flee back to Norway with his young bride and had her baptized at the court of Olaf Tryggvason.|$|E

25|$|On 15 May 1809, Baker and Tartar chased a Danish {{privateer}} sloop near Felixberg on {{the coast}} of Courland. The sloop was armed with two 12-pounders on slides and two long 4-pounders, and carried a crew of 24. Her crew ran her ashore and then left her, taking their muskets up behind some sand hills where some local civilians joined them. Baker, concerned that the schooner might harm British trade, sent in his boats to bring her out or destroy her. The British cutting out party boarded the privateer, without loss despite the small arms fire from the beach, got her off the shore, and turned her guns on the beach. While the boarding party was securing the vessel, one of the men fortunately discovered a lighted candle set in a powder cartridge in the magazine and extinguished it when it had only a half an inch to burn. The privateer's magazine contained about a hundredweight of powder; had it exploded it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>killed</b> the boarding party. The prize crew then brought the sloop off.

At the Chennai Egmore railway station, Velu's money is stolen by Speedu (Santhanam), a petty thief. He pursues Speedu on a motorbike parked at the station and manages to get back his money, but moments after alighting from the bike, the bike explodes.
