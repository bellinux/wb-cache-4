5|$|The Little Mother is an American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film stars Marie Eline who goes to her mother's employer and asks for her mother's job after she dies. Her employer is an artist with a kind heart and though the girl does not do the chores well. One of the artists models plot against him makes false charges against him, leading to his arrest. The little girl follows them and learns that they <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> obtain {{a large amount of}} money to have the false case dropped. She reports it to the police and the artist is freed, whereby he adopts the girl out of gratitude. Released on February 28, 1911, the film received mixed reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

25|$|Arkansas beat Boise State {{for their}} first win of 2002. An {{impressive}} day on the ground, 217 yards, coupled with seven Boise State turnovers, helped secure the Razorback victory. A blocked punt, a passing TD and then a rushing TD put the Razorbacks off to a 21–0 advantage. After two field goals and a TD strike to Decori Birmingham, the Hogs <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> a 34–0 lead, but the Broncos got on the board twice to make it 34–14. A fake field goal gave the Hogs a first down before Jones hooked up with Richard Smith on an 18-yard touchdown pass that closed the scoring at 41–14.|$|E
25|$|As they approached, Private Nunn threw a punch at Ridgeway, and a melee broke out. Bozman {{drew his}} gun and fired, hitting Adams in the neck. The crowd scattered, and jeeps arrived to rescue the wounded. Four black {{soldiers}} reported that the officers refused {{to take them to}} hospital. As the injured soldiers returned to the base, rumours began to spread that the MPs <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> shoot black soldiers, and panic spread around the base. A few soldiers slipped out, perhaps hoping to find the MPs and get revenge, but the majority stayed on base. The Colonel was absent, and so it fell to Major George C. Heris to calm the situation. Lieutenant Edwin D. Jones, the only black officer in the ranks, was able to persuade the soldiers that Heris would be able to round up the MPs and see that justice was done.|$|E
25|$|Matters {{continued}} {{badly for}} England on day three and they ended their first innings on 157 all out just after lunch, 246 short of their follow-on target of 403. Ian Bell {{was the only}} England batsman to offer any real resistance, spending nearly four hours at the crease before being dismissed by Stuart Clark for 50. It was a personal triumph for Bell, who had averaged just 17.10 in the 2005 series, looking particularly vulnerable against McGrath and Warne. England's other specialist batsman Kevin Pietersen was out for only 16, lbw to a ball from McGrath {{which he did not}} offer a shot at. All-rounder and captain Andrew Flintoff was out for a duck, caught behind off what replays suggested was a no-ball (not spotted by umpire Steve Bucknor) from Brett Lee. Brief resistance also came from wicketkeeper Geraint Jones and spinner Giles, who made 19 and a quickfire 24 respectively, but both <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Glenn McGrath. In total McGrath took 6 wickets for only 50 runs conceded, a powerful response to critics who had suggested that he was, at 36, too old to be a frontline bowler in an Ashes series.|$|E

25|$|On November 28, 2011, Ohio State {{announced}} that Urban Meyer {{was hired as}} head coach. Despite the program being on probation for NCAA violations and prohibited from appearing in a bowl for the 2012 season, the Buckeyes overcame a rash of injuries on defense in a season reminiscent of 2002 and completed a perfect 12–0 season with a victory over Michigan on November 24, 26–21. In {{one of the most}} incredible performances in college football history, Ohio State won the first ever College Football Playoff, with its third-string quarterback, Cardale Jones, after the starter and second-string quarterback <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> injury. Jones had never started in a college game. His first 3 starts were in the B1G Championship Game, the Sugar Bowl, and the National Championship Game. He went 3-0 to win the national championship. Many credit Urban Meyer with this being the best coaching job in college football history.. The next season brought with it expectations of a repeat championship as Ohio State returned many of its starters from the previous year. Ohio State would go on to compile a 13-1 record, with a crucial loss to Michigan State keeping them out of the College Football Playoff. In 2016, in spite of having the fewest returning starters of any team in the country, Ohio State would go on to win 11 games, but ultimately losing to Penn State in the regular season and Clemson in a crushing 31-0 defeat in the College Football Playoff Semifinal.|$|E

500|$|To placate {{both the}} Grand Duke and Marguerite Louise, Louis XIV sent the comte de Saint Mesme. In the conversations that took place, it emerged that Marguerite Louise {{wanted to return}} to France, and Mesme sympathised with this, as did much of the French court, so he {{concluded}} his visit without finding {{a solution to the}} heir's domestic problems, incensing both Ferdinando and Louis XIV. Now, Marguerite Louise began humiliating Cosimo on every posible occasion, as when she insisted on employing only French cooks as she claimed the Medici <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> poison her and when she branded Cosimo [...] "a poor groom" [...] in front of the Papal nuncio.|$|E
500|$|On December 7, 1941, the Japanese {{launched}} a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. Within {{a short time}} five of eight U.S. battleships were sunk or sinking, with the rest damaged. The American aircraft carriers <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> sea, however, and evaded detection. They took up the fight, and eventually turned the tide {{of the war in}} the Pacific. The sinking of the British battleship [...] and her escort, the battlecruiser , demonstrated the vulnerability of a battleship to air attack while at sea without sufficient air cover, settling the argument begun by Mitchell in 1921. Both warships were under way and en route to attack the Japanese amphibious force that had invaded Malaya when they were caught by Japanese land-based bombers and torpedo bombers on December 10, 1941.|$|E

Larson, whose interview had been altered to make him seem less happy, filed a formal fraud complaint and withdrew his release. [...] "They had some rather nasty, angry anti-gay people on there who were treated as professionals," [...] he said. [...] "I had no problem with Harry Morgan or Mike Wallace because they were thorough. But obviously others in the decision-making process were truly upset with homosexuality. They saw it {{as a threat to the}} human race and <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> kill as best they could."

500|$|On Burton's hiring, he and Logan {{reworked}} the screenplay; Logan {{felt they}} agreed over the film's tone due to [...] "share stunted childhoods watching Amicus movies". Turning a three-hour stage musical into a two-hour film required some changes. Some songs were shortened, {{while others were}} completely removed. Burton said [...] "In terms of the show, it was three hours long, but we weren't out to film the Broadway show, we <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> make a movie, so we {{tried to keep the}} pace like those old melodramas. Sondheim himself is not a real big fan of movie musicals, so he was really open to honing it down to a more pacey shape." [...] Burton and Logan also reduced the prominence of other secondary elements, such as the romance between Todd's daughter Johanna and Anthony, to allow them to focus on the triangular relationship between Todd, Mrs. Lovett, and Toby.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in September 1939, Prime Minister Robert Menzies announced the decision to form a Second Australian Imperial Force. He further directed that all commands in the new 6thDivision would go to militiamen. Lieutenant General Sir Thomas Blamey—who was appointed commander of the 6thDivision on 28September—selected Savige to command its 17thInfantry Brigade, the brigade from Victoria. Savige was given the AIF serial number VX13. He and Blamey had worked together when Blamey had commanded the 3rdDivision from 1931 to 1937, and Savige was [...] "almost fanatically loyal to Blamey through bad as well as good times". For regular officers, their exclusion from command positions was [...] "the final straw". Savige suspected—accurately in part—that Staff Corps officers <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> get him. A [...] "general atmosphere of criticism and derogation" [...] infected the force that would eventually sour relations between Blamey and some Staff Corps officers.|$|E
500|$|... "Gallaher played many dashing games," [...] the British {{newspaper}} The Sportsman reported {{after his}} death, [...] "and led his side from one success to another {{until they were}} deemed invincible. He was a veritable artist, who never deserved all the hard things said about him, especially in South Wales. A great player, a great judge of the game". Gallaher's military experience gave him an appreciation for [...] "discipline, cohesion and steadiness under pressure." [...] He was however quiet, even dour, and preferred to lead by example. He insisted players spend an hour [...] "contemplating the game ahead" [...] on match days, and also that they pay attention to detail. Original All Black Ernie Booth wrote of Gallaher: [...] "To us All Blacks his words would often be, 'Give nothing away; take no chance.' As a skipper he was somewhat a disciplinarian, doubtless imbibed from his previous military experience in South Africa. Still, he treated us all like men, not kids, who <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> 'play the game' for good old New Zealand." [...] Another contemporary said he was [...] "perhaps not the greatest of wing-forwards, as such; but he was acutely skilled as a judge of men and moves".|$|E

500|$|Starting in 1939, United States Coast Guard vessels {{were being}} used as weather ships to protect transatlantic air commerce, as a {{response}} to the crash of Pan American World Airways Hawaii Clipper during a transpacific flight in 1938. [...] The Atlantic Weather Observation Service was authorized by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt on January 25, 1940. [...] The Germans began to use weather ships in the summer of 1940. However, three of their four ships had been sunk by November 23, which led to the use of fishing vessels for the German weather ship fleet. Their weather ships <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> sea for three to five weeks at a time and German weather observations were enciphered using Enigma machines. [...] By February 1941, five [...] United States Coast Guard cutters were used in weather patrol, usually deployed for three weeks at a time, then sent back to port for ten days. As World War II continued, the cutters were needed for the war effort and by August 1942, six cargo vessels had replaced them. The ships were defenseless, which led to the loss of the USCGC Muskeget (WAG-48) with 121 aboard on September 9, 1942. In 1943, the United States Weather Bureau recognized their observations as [...] "indispensable" [...] during the war effort.|$|E
500|$|The Armistice renewed the {{war between}} Stengel and Dreyfuss, and the outfielder held out again to begin the 1919 season. Both wanted to see Stengel traded, but no deal was {{immediately}} made. By then, Stengel's position as regular right fielder had been taken by Billy Southworth, and he had difficulty breaking back into the lineup. Stengel played better than he had before he enlisted, {{and by the time}} Dreyfuss traded him to the Philadelphia Phillies for Possum Whitted on August 9, he was batting [...]293 with four home runs. But before being traded, Stengel pulled one of his most famous stunts, on May 25 at Ebbets Field, {{as a member of the}} visiting Pirates. It was not unusual at Ebbets Field for right fielders of either team, rather than go to the dugout after three <b>were</b> <b>out,</b> <b>to</b> go to the Dodgers' bullpen, in foul territory down the right field line, if they were not likely to bat in the upcoming inning. Stengel did so to visit old friends, and discovered that pitcher Leon Cadore had captured a sparrow. Stengel took it, and, called to bat in the sixth inning, quietly placed it under his cap. He received mixed boos and cheers from the Brooklyn crowd as a former Dodger, took a deep bow at the plate, and doffed his cap, whereupon the bird flew away to great laughter from the crowd.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} season {{each member}} of the West Coast Express suffered a decline in performance. The trio were unable to complete the season as a unit due to injuries and suspension. On February 16, 2004 in a game against the Colorado Avalanche, Naslund received a [...] "questionable hit" [...] from the Avalanche's Steve Moore. Suffering a minor concussion from the hit and a hyper-extended elbow when he fell to the ice, he missed three games due to his injuries. While Moore was unpenalized for the hit, some Canucks players felt that it was a [...] "cheap shot". In the second rematch of the two teams after Moore's hit on Naslund, Vancouver allegedly put a [...] "bounty" [...] on Moore and <b>were</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> make him [...] "pay a price". Early in the game, Moore clashed with Cooke, but later refused to fight Bertuzzi, despite being taunted and followed around the ice. [...] After being refused the fight, Bertuzzi punched Moore in the head from behind and slammed him into the ice. Bertuzzi was subsequently suspended indefinitely by the NHL, and the resulting injuries ended Moore's career and left him suffering from concussion symptoms over the following seven years. Despite the loss of Bertuzzi, the Canucks won the Northwest Division. In the opening round Vancouver faced their division rival Calgary Flames. In the series Vancouver fell behind three games to two. They took a 4–0 lead in game six before the Flames came back to tie the game and send it to overtime. The game remained tied into the third overtime when Morrison scored at the 2:28 mark to force game seven. In game seven the Canucks were again trailing late into the third period in the closing seconds Naslund went around Flames defenceman Jordan Leopold drove the net and put a shot on goal. Flames goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff, made the save but Cooke scored on the rebound with just 5.7 seconds remain to force overtime. The Canucks failed to capitalize on the change in momentum as the Flames' Martin Gelinas scored 1:25 into overtime eliminating Vancouver. Naslund recorded nine points in the seven game series while Morrison chipped in five. During the off-season Naslund received the last of his individual NHL honors being named a First Team NHL All-Star once again.|$|E
