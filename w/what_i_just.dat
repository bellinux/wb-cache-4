He said, 'Do you know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> told the JCS? I am sixty-years old, I have thirty-five years of service, I have a physical infirmity that will allow me to retire tomorrow, and I will do it if you don't leave me alone and let me do my job.'" ...|$|E

I'm sorry. Sorry, sir.' So I ask him another question, {{he looks at his}} watch and I said, 'You're done, get out of here." [...] Millen said he then told Russell to go to see head coach Rod Marinelli, who later also told Russell to leave his office. [...] "So I'm done, I can't believe <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> witnessed, and so I call Al," [...] Millen said, [...] "I get on the phone and I say, 'Coach, I don't know what you're thinking, but don't take JaMarcus Russell. Don't take Calvin Johnson, but don't take JaMarcus Russell." ...|$|E
2500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, both David Sims and Todd VanDerWerff {{gave the}} episode an [...] "A" [...] grade. Sims (writing {{for people who}} have not read the novels) {{expressed}} shock at the deaths of several main characters, writing, [...] "I don’t think I’ve really processed <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> watched". VanDerWerff, who reviews the episodes {{for people who have}} read the novels, wrote [...] "If [...] doesn’t terribly want to deal with the thought of the deaths of Catelyn and Robb, well, he or she can read that much more quickly. Or he or she can read that much more slowly if there’s a need to process the emotions more fully. On TV, you can't really do that." [...] Reviewing for Forbes, Erik Kain called the episode [...] "one of the best episodes of HBO's dark drama yet", and noted [...] "there was a deeper sense of tragedy knowing [...] also lost his unborn child". Sean Collins of the Rolling Stone also praised the episode, and commented on the unusual step the show took in ending one of its central conflicts. Sarah Hughes of The Guardian highlighted the decision to kill Talisa, writing that her [...] "heartbreaking end was unbearable".|$|E

2500|$|Jackson {{developed}} body dysmorphia as {{a response}} to ridicule, stating, [...] "I'd {{look in the mirror and}} hate myself. I'd sit and cry. It was so hard for me to look at myself and find something that I liked. Not just physically, but something that was good in me". She also inflicted self-harm, banging her head against the wall when feeling unattractive. She traced her fragility to her abusive marriage to recording artist James DeBarge when she was 16 years old. Jackson recalled, [...] "It all has to do with very low self esteem. Especially going into a relationship like that very young... someone telling you things like, 'no one is ever going to want you again, you should be happy here with me.'" [...] Attempting to alter his behavior and drug addiction, she explained, [...] "I learned the hard way that you can't change a person." [...] Recalling her divorce, she revealed, [...] "There came a point when I finally said, 'You know <b>what?</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> don't care what happens.' I had to do what I wanted to but had been too afraid to. And at that point I didn't care if I got my brains beat out. I just went ahead and did it. And I got my ass kicked for it. But I'm happy that I did it, or I don't think I would be here today".|$|E

6000|$|Then do {{they not}} see that when the Welsh {{mountains}} were ground down, the Silurian strata, being uppermost, would be ground down first, and would go to make the lower strata of the great New Red Sandstone Lowland; and that being sandy, they would make the sandstones? But wherever they were ground through, the Lower Cambrian slates would be laid bare; and their remains, being washed away by the sea the last, would be washed on {{to the top of}} the remains of the Silurians; and so (as in most cases) the remains of the older rock, when redeposited by water, would lie on the remains of the younger rock. And {{do they not}} see that (if <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> said is true) these slates would grind up into red marl, such as is seen over the west and south of Cheshire and Staffordshire and far away into Nottinghamshire? The red marl must almost certainly have been black slate somewhere, somewhen. Why should it not have been such in Snowdon? And why should not the slates in the roof be the remnants of the very beds which are now the marl in the fields? ...|$|E

Gettin' cold won't spoil it none. Now, listen. You're the only one I got in this world. You wasn't afraid of me an' <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> done, an' I'm glad of that. Now we'll forget all about Mary. I got charity enough. I'm just as sorry for her as you. I'd do {{anything}} for her. I'd wash her feet for her like Christ did. I'd let her eat at my table, an' sleep under my roof. But all that ain't no reason I should touch anything she's earned. Now forget her. It's you an' me, Saxon, only you an' me an' to hell with the rest of the world. Nothing else counts. You won't never have to be afraid of me again.

6000|$|Now, it {{is a very}} {{remarkable}} fact--but it is true of {{most things}} in this world--that there is hardly anything one-sided, or of one nature; and it is not immediately obvious what of the things that interest us may be regarded as pure science, and what may be regarded as pure art. It may be that there are some peculiarly constituted persons who, before they have advanced far into the depths of geometry, find artistic beauty about it; but, taking the generality of mankind, I think it may be said that, when they begin to learn mathematics, their whole souls are absorbed in tracing the connection between the premisses and the conclusion, and that to them geometry is pure science. So I think it may be said that mechanics and osteology are pure science. On the other hand, melody in music is pure art. You cannot reason about it; there is no proposition involved in it. So, again, in the pictorial art, an arabesque, or a [...] "harmony in grey," [...] touches none but the aesthetic faculty. But a great mathematician, and even many persons who are not great mathematicians, will tell you that they derive immense pleasure from geometrical reasonings. Everybody knows mathematicians speak of solutions and problems as [...] "elegant," [...] and they tell you that a certain mass of mystic symbols is [...] "beautiful, quite lovely." [...] Well, you do not see it. They do see it, because the intellectual process, the process of comprehending the reasons symbolised by these figures and these signs, confers upon them a sort of pleasure, such as an artist has in visual symmetry. Take a science of which I may speak with more confidence, and which is the most attractive of those I am concerned with. It is what we call morphology, which consists in tracing out the unity in variety of the infinitely diversified structures of animals and plants. I cannot give you any example of a thorough aesthetic pleasure more intensely real than a pleasure of this kind--the pleasure which arises in one's mind when a whole mass of different structures run into one harmony as the expression of a central law. That is where the province of art overlays and embraces the province of intellect. And, if I may venture to express an opinion on such a subject, the great majority of forms of art are not in the sense <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> now defined them to be--pure art; but they derive much of their quality from simultaneous and even unconscious excitement of the intellect.|$|E
