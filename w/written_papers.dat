The group was known as the Forum, and was formalized as a closed group of 30 members in 1925 who pledged not to discuss the material with others. Over time, some participants left and others joined, leading to a total membership of 486 people over the years from diverse backgrounds and a mix of interest levels. A smaller group of five individuals called the Contact Commission, including the Sadlers, was responsible for gathering the questions from the Forum, acting as the custodians of the handwritten manuscripts that were presented as answers, and arranging for proofreading and typing of the material. Bill Sadler, Jr. is noted to have composed the table of contents that is published with the book.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the firm}} where Douglas {{received}} his training {{was in a}} provincial city {{in the north of}} England, it was {{at the forefront of the}} Gothic Revival in the country. The Gothic Revival was a reaction against the neoclassical style, which had been popular in the 18th and early 19thcenturies, and it incorporated features of the Gothic style of the Middle Ages. Both Edmund Sharpe and E. G. Paley had been influenced by the Cambridge Camden Society and, more specifically, by A. W. N Pugin who believed that [...] "Gothic was the only correct and Christian way to build". Sharpe had also been influenced by Thomas Rickman, and he had <b>written</b> <b>papers</b> on medieval scholarship himself. Paley had been influenced by his brother, Frederick Apthorp Paley, who was enthusiastic about Gothic architecture, and who had also been influenced by Rickman. During the time Douglas was working in Lancaster the firm was responsible for building and restoring churches in Gothic Revival style, one of which was StWilfrid's Church in the Cheshire village of Davenham, some [...] from Sandiway. Douglas's first church, that of StJohn the Evangelist at Over, Winsford, was entirely English Gothic in style, more specifically Early Decorated.|$|E

2500|$|The Higgs {{mechanism}} {{is a process}} by which vector bosons can acquire rest mass without explicitly breaking gauge invariance, as a byproduct of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Initially, the mathematical theory behind spontaneous symmetry breaking was conceived and published within particle physics by Yoichiro Nambu in 1960, and the concept that such a mechanism could offer a possible solution for the [...] "mass problem" [...] was originally suggested in 1962 by Philip Anderson (who had previously <b>written</b> <b>papers</b> on broken symmetry and its outcomes in superconductivity, and concluded in his 1963 paper on the Yang-Mills theory, that [...] "considering the superconducting analog... hese two types of bosons seem capable of canceling each other out... leaving finite mass bosons"), and Abraham Klein and Benjamin Lee showed in March 1964, that Goldstone's theorem could be avoided this way {{in at least some}} non-relativistic cases, and speculated it might be possible in truly relativistic cases.|$|E

Charles shone in theology and scraped through in the other subjects. He was also exhausted and depressed, writing to Fox [...] "I do not know why the degree should make one so miserable." [...] In later life he recalled Paley and Euclid being the only part of the course which was useful to him, and [...] "By answering well the examination questions in Paley, by doing Euclid well, and by not failing miserably in Classics, I gained a good place among the οἱ πολλοί, or crowd of men who do not go in for honours." ...|$|E

40|$|Automatically {{generating}} the related work section for a <b>writing</b> <b>paper</b> {{is useful for}} researchers as it can {{save a lot of}} time and avoid missing related works. The related work section of scientific paper usually introduces other researchers' work published before and makes comparisons with the current author's work. This paper proposes an approach to automatically generating related work by comparing the main text of the <b>writing</b> <b>paper</b> with the citations to the references from other papers. Our approach firstly collects the papers that cite the reference <b>papers</b> of the <b>writing</b> <b>paper</b> and extracts the corresponding citation sentences to form a citation document. It then makes a summarization that makes a comparison between the citation document and the <b>writing</b> <b>paper's</b> abstract, introduction and conclusion. It extracts the representative keywords from the citation document and the <b>writing</b> <b>paper,</b> and constructs a graph of the keywords. The discriminated nodes in the graph are figured out, and then the minimum Steiner tree that covers the nodes is extracted. A summary is generated by extracting the sentences covering the Steiner tree. The experiments show that our approach outperforms three baselines MEAD, ReWoS and ARWG according to ROUGE evaluation results...|$|R

Its contents seemed to be <b>written</b> <b>papers,</b> thrust in disorder into this uncommon secre'taire. But from among these Jeanie brought an old clasped Bible, which had been David Deans's companion in his earlier wanderings, and which he had given to his daughter when the failure of his eyes had compelled him to use one of a larger print. This she gave to Butler, who had been looking at her motions with some surprise, and desired him to see what that book could do for him. He opened the clasps, and to his astonishment a parcel of L50 bank-notes dropped out from betwixt the leaves, where they had been separately lodged, and fluttered upon the floor.

Everything is being thought out and then tried over that can possibly make victory. The Germans go in for psychology much more than we do, just as they go in for war more than we do, but they don't seem to be really clever about it. So they set out to make all their men understand the war, while our chaps are singing 'Tipperary.' But what the men put down aren't the beautiful things they ought to put down; most of them shove down lists of their meals, some of the diaries are all just lists of things eaten, and a lot of them have written the most damning stuff about outrages and looting. Which the French are translating and publishing. The Germans would give anything now to get back these silly diaries.
