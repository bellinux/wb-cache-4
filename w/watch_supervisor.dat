At 02:15, the <b>watch</b> <b>supervisor</b> at Kuala Lumpur ACC queried Malaysia Airlines' operations centre, which said that it could exchange signals with Flight 370 and that Flight 370 was in Cambodian airspace. Kuala Lumpur ACC contacted Ho Chi Minh ACC to ask whether the planned flight path for Flight 370 passed through Cambodian airspace. Ho Chi Minh ACC responded that Flight 370 {{was not supposed to}} enter Cambodian airspace and that they had already contacted Phnom Penh ACC (which controls Cambodian airspace), which had no contact with Flight 370. Kuala Lumpur ACC contacted Malaysia Airlines' operations centre at 02:34, inquiring about the communication status with Flight 370, and were informed that Flight 370 was in a normal condition based on a signal download and that it was located at [...] Later, another Malaysia Airlines aircraft (Flight 386 bound for Shanghai) attempted, at the request of Ho Chi Minh ACC, to contact Flight 370 on the Lumpur Radar frequency—the frequency on which Flight 370 last made contact with Malaysian air traffic control—and on emergency frequencies. The attempt was unsuccessful.|$|E

40|$|Air {{traffic control}} {{is one of}} the most dynamic and {{stressful}} jobs in the world. In the United States Air Force (USAF), it is not uncommon for 18 year-old Airmen to arrive at an air traffic control tower to begin on the job training after graduating from the four month basic air traffic control training course. Each controller is responsible for multiple multimillion dollar aircraft and hundreds of human lives each time control instructions are transmitted; therefore, control tower leadership is essential to maintaining a safe, orderly, and effective flow of air traffic. Air traffic control <b>watch</b> <b>supervisors</b> must be able to transcend a solitary leadership style and when driven by the situation, morph from delegating to directing in a split second. Due to the fluid nature of the job, ever changing traffic conditions, and personality makeup of the personnel involved, air traffic control is the perfect environment to explore situational leadership. United States Air Force air traffic controllers facilitated approximately 6. 3 million aircraft operations in 2011 (Kahne, 2011). These numbers includ...|$|R
40|$|Supervision {{is a major}} {{component}} of psychology training programs. This paper explores the difference between "traditional " supervision received by a doctoral clinical psychology student and "live " supervision. In traditional psychotherapy supervision, practicum experiences generally require the student to see a client and then report back to the supervisor for feedback and direction regarding the client. Often, the supervisor has had little or no contact with the client. Supervision in the traditional mode has apparent limitations because it rejies heavily on the recollections and interpretations of the trainee, which may be unreliable. With direct live supervision the <b>supervisor</b> <b>watches</b> an ongoing interview, enters the session and intervenes in the therapy process. The main advantage of live supervision, although costly in terms of time and funding of faculty, is that the trainees are abl...|$|R

50|$|Kelso {{sets up a}} {{headquarters}} in the Randalls' house and assigns a team to keep the cat under surveillance, but {{through a couple of}} careless moves, DC manages to elude them. Eventually a bugging device is implanted in DC's collar and the cat leads Kelso into a comical chase at a drive-in movie and several backyards. After several failed attempts and without hard evidence about the <b>watch,</b> <b>Supervisor</b> Newton shuts down the operation. Patti disguises herself as a hippie merchant who pretends to be a niece of a jeweler she knows well, Mr. Hoffsteddar (Ed Wynn), and she calls the FBI to persuade them that the watch belonging to Miss Miller was indeed hard evidence. Patti and Kelso rescue Miss Miller and bring the robbers to justice.|$|E
50|$|The actions {{once again}} {{take place in}} the small French town of Saint-Tropez. While driving with one of his gendarmes, Cruchot (Louis de Funes) has to stop in order to fix the car. The gendarme wanders away and sees a flying saucer in a field which then flies away. He tries to tell Cruchot {{and the rest of the}} station, but they don't believe him. Shortly after, the same occurs with Cruchot and the chief of the gendarmes. This time it is Cruchot who wanders away and sees the saucer, however the chief does not believe him. Later on, when the same gendarme is doing {{paperwork}} in the office, a young man appears in front of him and says that he is a part of an alien expedition which has arrived to Saint-Tropez in order to examine humanity as people from all around the globe go to Saint-Tropez during the summer. The alien demonstrates its shapeshifting ability by transforming into the same gendarme it is talking to. The gendarme runs and tells Cruchot, who doesn't believe him. In the midst of the racket, the chief comes and sends the gendarme away. The chief reveals that he is actually an alien disguised as the chief, and when Cruchot doesn't believe him the alien becomes agitated and uses laser vision to cause damage to Cruchot's room. He relents when a watch on his hand flashes red and drinks something out of a flask. The alien begins coughing and upon hitting it on the back, Cruchot discovers it makes a metallic sound. Later on when the real chief arrives, Cruchot stabs him with a screwdriver thinking that it is the alien. The chief orders Cruchot out, since the supervisor will come in tomorrow to check up on the station. During the check up, Cruchot notices the same <b>watch</b> on the <b>supervisor</b> as on the alien he saw last night and attempts to attack him. The gendarmes hold him back while the alien supervisor flees, and the real supervisor arrive. Cruchot once again stabs the real supervisor thinking he is an alien. He is arrested, but escapes the station.|$|R

5000|$|The {{final phase}} of the {{incident}} was described in some detail by T/Sgt. Forrest Perkins, who was the <b>Watch</b> <b>Supervisor</b> in the Lakenheath Radar Air Traffic Control centre, and who wrote directly to the Condon Committee in 1968. Perkins claimed that two RAF De Havilland Venom interceptors were scrambled and directed towards a radar target near Lakenheath. The pilot of the first Venom achieved contact, but then found that the target manoeuvred behind him and chased the aircraft {{for a period of}} around 10 minutes despite the latter’s taking violent evasive action; Perkins characterised the pilot as [...] "getting worried, excited and also pretty scared". The second Venom was forced to return to its home station due to engine problems; Perkins stated that the target remained on their screens for a short period before leaving on a northerly heading.|$|E
