40|$|PURPOSE: Buprenorphine is an {{alternative}} to methadone for the maintenance treatment of heroine dependence and may be effective on a thrice weekly basis. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of thrice <b>weekly</b> buprenorphine <b>maintenance</b> {{for the treatment of}} heroin dependence in a primary care clinic on retention in treatment and illicit opioid use. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Opioid-dependent patients were randomly assigned to receive thrice <b>weekly</b> buprenorphine <b>maintenance</b> in a primary care clinic that was affiliated with a drug treatment program (n 5 23) or in a traditional drug treat-ment program (n 5 23) in a 12 -week clinical trial. Primary outcomes were retention in treatment and urine toxicology for opioids; secondary outcomes were opioid withdrawal symp-toms and toxicology for cocaine. RESULTS: Retention during the 12 -week study was higher in the primary care setting (78 %, 18 of 23) than in the drug treat-ment setting (52 %, 12 of 23; P 5 0. 06). Patients admitted to primary care had lower rates of opioid use based on overall urine toxicology (63 % versus 85 %, P, 0. 01) and were more likely to achieve 3 or more consecutive weeks of abstinence (43 % versus 13 %, P 5 0. 02).

The second group (24 patients) received 30 mg/m 2 /week i. v. epirubicin for 8 weeks followed by monthly maintenance therapy for 4 – 6 months. The third group (23 patients) received oral estramustine phosphate (EMP) at {{a dose of}} 840 mg/day together with <b>weekly</b> and monthly <b>maintenance</b> epirubicin. The response rates, mean survival times, and toxicity were determined. Within the first 3 months, pain and performance scores were improved {{by at least one}} degree in all the groups. One patient in group two and three patients in group three had complete response. Partial response rates were 23 % in group 1, 25 % in group 2, and 17 % in group 3. Stable disease rates were 41 % in group 1, 33 % in group 2, and 26 % in group 3. The progression rates within the first 3 months were 36 % in group 1, 38 % in group 2, and 44 % in group 3.

40|$|Introduction: During hygienic-microbiological {{monitoring}} of the water quality in dental units, the total bacterial colony count was found to exceed the limits for drinking water quality; in addition, mold contamination was detected. The presumed cause was irregular decontamination of the units through purging and intensive decontamination. Methods: To decontaminate the units, the manufacturer’s recommended program for cleaning and intensive decontamination was intensified by shortened intervals over a 2 -week period. For Sirona units, instead of once a day, the automatic purge program was run every morning and evening for 20 min each time, and instead of once a month, intensive decontamination was performed every two weeks; this schedule has been maintained since then. For KaVo units, cleaning with the hydroclean function was carried out for 2. 5 min every morning and evening. The automatic intensive decontamination was run daily instead of <b>weekly.</b> A <b>maintenance</b> log book was introduced, in which decontamination/cleaning was confirmed by the operator’s signature. Results: Within 5 weeks, all previously contaminated units were decontaminated. Discussion: By shortening the cleaning and intensive decontamination intervals in a 2 -week period with subsequent control that the recommended maintenance intervals were kept, {{it was possible to}} guarantee drinking-water quality in the dental units of both manufacturers...|$|R
