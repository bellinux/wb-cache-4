During the 1950s the USSR claimed the gold regularly but was rejected. In 1967, the Labour government used the reserve in settling mutuals claims with the Soviet Union.

40|$|Abstract Background The Kagera {{region of}} north western Tanzania has a rich culture of {{traditional}} medicine use and practices. The dynamic inter-ethnic interactions {{of different people}} from the surrounding countries constitute a rich reservoir of herbal based healing practices. This study, the second on an ongoing series, reports on the medicinal plant species used in Katoro ward, Bukoba District, and tries to use the literature to establish proof of the therapeutic claims. Methodology Ethnomedical information was collected using Semi-structured interviews in Kyamlaile and Kashaba villages of Katoro, and in roadside bushes on the way from Katoro to Bukoba through Kyaka. Data collected included the common/local names of the plants, parts used, the diseases treated, methods of preparation, dosage, frequency and duration of treatments. Information on toxicity and antidote were also collected. Literature was consulted to get corroborative information on similar ethnomedical claims and proven biological activities of the plants. Results Thirty three (33) plant species for treatement of 13 different disease categories were documented. The most frequently treated diseases were those categorized as specific diseases/conditions (23. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>remedies)</b> while eye diseases were the least treated using medicinal plants (1. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>remedies).</b> Literature reports support 47 % of the claims including proven anti-malarial, anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory activity or similar ethnomedical uses. Leaves were {{the most frequently used}} plant part (20 species) followed by roots (13 species) while making of decoctions, pounding, squeezing, making infusions, burning and grinding to powder were the most common methods used to prepare a majority of the therapies. Conclusion Therapeutic claims made on plants used in traditional medicine in Katoro ward of Bukoba district are well supported by literature, with 47 % of the claims having already been reported. This study further enhances the validity of plants used in traditional medicine in this region as resources that can be relied on to provide effective, accessible and affordable basic healthcare to the local communities. The plants documented also have the potential of being used in drug development and on farm domestication initiatives. </p...|$|R

Many plant species are traditionally used for respiratory illness treatment, and some have been investigated for their efficacy with positive results. A total of 91 plant species belonging to 82 genera and 48 families were documented and identified as respiratory system herbal remedies in Northern Peru. Most species used were Asteraceae (15 species, 16. 67 %), followed by Lamiaceae and Fabaceae (8. 89 % and 5. 56 %). The majority of respiratory disorder herbal preparations were prepared from the leaves of plants (27. 69 %), while the whole plant (18. 46 %), flowers (13. 85 %) and stems (17. 69 %) were used less frequently. In almost 55 % of the cases fresh plant material was used to prepare remedies. About 86 % of the remedies were applied orally, while the remaining ones were applied topically.

40|$|Contaminants in the vadose zone may {{act as a}} {{potential}} long-term source of groundwater contamination {{and need to be}} considered in remedy evaluations. In many cases, remediation decisions for the vadose zone will need to be made all or in part based on projected impacts to groundwater. Because there are significant natural attenuation processes inherent in vadose zone contaminant transport, remediation in the vadose zone to protect groundwater is functionally a combination of natural attenuation and use of other remediation techniques, as needed, to mitigate contaminant flux to groundwater. Attenuation processes include both hydrobiogeochemical processes that serve to retain contaminants within porous media and physical processes that mitigate the rate of water flux. In particular, the physical processes controlling fluid flow in the vadose zone are quite different and generally have a more significant attenuation impact on contaminant transport relative to those within the groundwater system. A remedy evaluation framework is presented herein that uses an adaptation of the established EPA Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) evaluation approach and a conceptual model based approach focused on identifying and quantifying features and processes that control contaminant flux through the vadose zone. A key concept for this framework is to recognize that MNA will comprise some portion <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>remedies</b> in the vadose zone. Thus, structuring evaluation of vadose zone waste sites to use an MNA-based approach provides information necessary to either select MNA as the remedy, if appropriate, or to quantify how much additional attenuation would need to be induced by a remedial action (e. g., technologies considered in a feasibility study) to augment the natural attenuation processes and meet groundwater protection goals...|$|R

40|$|After the 2008 recession, it is {{difficult}} to imagine that the public is investing billions of dollars in publicly traded entities with little regulation of board conflicts and no fiduciary duty protections. Yet, that is precisely the case for more than $ 284 billion of investments. Investors have flocked to publicly traded limited partnerships (LPs) and limited liability companies (LLCs), collectively known as master limited partnerships (MLPs), because many are high-performing energy companies with a tax preference. MLP market capitalization, while only $ 14 billion in 2000, topped $ 284 billion as of February 2016, and more initial public offerings are on the horizon. Dazzled by the possibility of high yields, individual investors are likely unaware that they do not enjoy the same fiduciary duty protections that apply to stockholders of publicly traded corporations. Delaware corporate law offers significant investor protections largely flowing from an unwaivable duty of loyalty. In contrast, Delaware’s alternative entity scheme permits the <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> fiduciary duties in LP and LLC agreements. Publicly traded LPs are also exempt from listing rules that normally require independent board members. Even where special committees vet conflicted transactions, committee members may have affiliations with the MLP’s corporate sponsor and owe conflicting duties to the sponsor and the limited partners. Scholars suggest that “uncorporate” substitutes could theoretically mitigate the absence of fiduciary duties, but empirical research shows that publicly traded MLPs rarely adopt such substitutes. The realities of the MLP marketplace leave investors with only the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, which is not a substitute for traditional fiduciary duties. This Article exposes the many obstacles investors have faced in obtaining remedies under MLP agreements. It argues that Contractarian theories or legal diversification constructs do not justify the under-regulation of publicly traded MLPs. This Article recommends reinstating the duty of loyalty for MLPs and ending the LP exception from board independence requirements...|$|R
