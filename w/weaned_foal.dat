50|$|Weaning in horses {{usually takes}} place when the foal is 4 to 5 months old, as {{by this point}} the foal no longer needs {{nutrients}} beyond what the mare offers. Prior to <b>weaning</b> the <b>foal,</b> there is usually a creep feeder set up to allow the foal to begin consuming feed that the mare cannot access. There are two main approaches to <b>weaning</b> <b>foals,</b> abrupt and gradual weaning. Abrupt weaning is when the mare and foal are separated, usually without contact. Gradual weaning consists of the separating the mare and foal, but still with contact, but not enough contact that allows nursing to occur, and then {{after a period of}} time the mare and foal are separated not allowing contact, or, in some cases, sight of each other. <b>Foals</b> that are <b>weaned</b> by the abrupt method have shown to have higher stressful behaviors displayed. Weaning foals in groups for both methods can reduce stress in the foals.|$|R
50|$|In {{the context}} of horses and horse breeds, semi-feral animals are those which are often untrained but usually owned by individuals. They are allowed to run in a natural state {{approaching}} that of wild conditions, but are periodically rounded up for assorted reasons, such as to <b>wean</b> <b>foals,</b> administer routine or emergency veterinary care, and so on. An example is the Camargue horse of France. Truly feral horses, such as the American Mustang or Australian Brumby have domesticated ancestors, but generally have no human ownership and live in essentially wild conditions, though they may also occasionally be rounded up for various management purposes. A true wild horse can only be a horse without any domesticated ancestors. The only living, truly wild horse is the Przewalski's horse.|$|R
40|$|Behavioral {{responses}} to weaning were studied in 21 foals {{assigned to one}} of five treat-ments: (1) abrupt, total separation of mare and foal, no pre-weaning creep feed (TSNC); (2) total separation but with creep feed (TSC); (3) partial separation of mare and foal allowing fence-line contact, no pre-weaning creep feed (PSNC); (4) partial separation but with creep feed (PSC); (5) control (CON), no separation of mare and foal with creep feed. Foals were observed for 5 h immediately after weaning. Vocalization frequency and times of the following behaviors were recorded: lying down; standing still; walking; trotting; cantering. The TSNC foals spent more time walking than PSNC, PSC or CON foals, and spent less time standing still than foals on all other treatments. The TSC, PSNC, PSC and CON foals spent more time standing still than walking. There were no significant reat-ment effects on times spent lying down or cantering, but TSNC foals tended (P < 0. 06) to spend more time trotting than other foals. The PSC and CON foals were not different in locomotor patterns, indicating that during <b>weaning</b> PSC <b>foals</b> utilized the same patterns of activity behavior as unweaned <b>foals,</b> and <b>weaning</b> stress was apparently minimal.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} which housing and exercise conditions are relevant for the development of osteochondrosis in warmblood foals. Radiological examinations of an equine veterinary clinic in The Netherlands were used to manually create a digital database containing the prevalence of OC in European Warmblood Horses in the age of 1 to 5 years. The database contained 828 horses of 351 breeders. The breeders (≥ five horses) were asked to perform a questionnaire about environmental factors including housing, feeding and management. The housing practices contained i. a. size of stables, pastures and amount of exercise. The questionnaire was divided in periods of life stage of the foal; <b>foal</b> before <b>weaning</b> and <b>foal</b> after <b>weaning</b> until the age of one. The final database of the 45 collaborating breeders contained 626 European Warmblood Horses. The number of OC-affected horses determined the OC-status of a horse farm (> 25 % OC positive horses on the farm results in a high OC status farm). One significant relation is found between group composition on sex in pasture and the farm OC status. Separate pasture for male and female <b>weaned</b> <b>foals</b> seems to have a relation with a low farm OC status. More research is necessary to further investigation and specification of the factors that are considered to be relevant for the development of osteochondrose in warmblood foals...|$|R
50|$|Weaning the foal usually occurs {{much later}} in the wild than on the farm, where it is usually {{separated}} from its mother {{at the age of}} six month. Although the six-month-old foal has moved from mother's milk to a forage diet, this age of separation is considered too early to ensure the foal has learned enough from its mother. This can lead the foal to later develop stable defects or other problems. One way to avoid this is to <b>wean</b> <b>foals</b> in a group, and keep with the group one or more adult horses other than the mothers, so that the foals can continue to learn the social codes of their own species. Mare milk production also poses an ethical question, as the presence of the foal is necessary to ensure milk flow in the mare. Taking the milk means it will not be consumed by the colt, and results in a strong chance that the latter will be sold for slaughter (as deficient).|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} aims to {{investigate}} whether the presence of unrelated adult horses at weaning would reduce the social stress of weaning {{and the emergence of}} undesirable behaviours. We tested this hypothesis in 32 domestic foals by comparing short and medium term behavioural and physiological responses to <b>weaning</b> in <b>foals</b> maintained in homogeneous groups of peers (PW) to those of foals grouped with both peers and unrelated adults (AW). In total, three trials were conducted, which each trial consisting of one AW group and one PW group. In all <b>foals,</b> <b>weaning</b> was followed by increased vocalization, increased locomotion and increased salivary cortisol concentration. However, signs of stress were less pronounced and shorter in duration in weanlings housed with unrelated adults (e. g., whinnies: p 0. 05; salivary cortisol: p 0. 05). Only foals without adults exhibited increased aggressiveness towards peers (p 0. 05) and abnormal behaviours (p 0. 05) such as excessive wood-chewing and redirected sucking towards peers.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryJoann M. KoubaThe {{objectives}} {{of these studies}} were to (1) characterize mare milk and fecal bacteria, and foal fecal microbiota from birth to 4 mo and (2) {{determine the effect of}} weaning and <b>weaning</b> method on <b>foal</b> fecal bacterial composition. Next generation sequencing of the V 4 region of the bacterial 16 S rRNA gene was performed using the Illumina Miseq according to Earth Microbiome Project protocols and sequencing data was analyzed using QIIME. In experiment 1, mare milk, mare fecal, and foal fecal samples were collected from 9 mare and foal pairs at birth (d 0), d 2, 7, and 1, 2, 3 and 4 mo. In experiment 2, 9 foals were separated into 2 treatments: abrupt (n = 5) and gradual (n = 4) weaning methods. Fecal samples were collected the day before weaning (d- 1), the day of weaning (d 0) and post-weaning on d 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7. Blood was collected for analysis of cortisol concentration at 0800 h on d - 1, 1, 2, and at 0800 h and 1100 h on d 0 and 4. Heart rate was recorded in 10 min intervals on the day of weaning starting 1 h before weaning to 2 h post-weaning, and again for 1 h starting 24 h after weaning. Results from experiment 1 showed newborn foal meconium and mare milk were similar in species diversity and composition; however, large shifts in composition and increases in foal fecal bacterial diversity occurred within the first week. By 1 mo, foal fecal bacterial composition did not differ in composition from mare feces at the phylum level (P = 1. 0). Firmicutes, Bacteriodetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Spirochaetes were the dominant phyla found in feces of foals 1 mo and older and adult mare feces. For experiment 2, there were no differences in species diversity (P > 0. 05) or separations in bacterial community structure between weaning methods or before and after weaning. There were minor shifts in relative abundance of specific phyla and genera in response to <b>weaning.</b> <b>Foals</b> in the abrupt treatment group had increased cortisol concentrations on d 1 (P < 0. 05) and increased heart rate for 50 min after weaning on d 0 (P < 0. 05). The foal is born with fecal microbial communities similar to milk that rapidly change {{during the first week of}} life, reaching the same composition of its dam by the first month. The foal fecal microbiota matures prior to weaning, therefore weaning did not cause drastic changes in bacterial composition. Although acute stress was increased in abruptly <b>weaned</b> <b>foals,</b> stress associated with different weaning methods did not influence the fecal microbiota within the first week post-weaning...|$|R
40|$|Osteochondrosis (OC) is a {{very common}} disease in Dutch warmblood horses. The dynamic process of the endochondral {{ossification}} gets disturbed, which can result in irregular cartilage in equine joints, mostly hock and stifle. This causes economical, emotional and genetic losses in the horse industry in The Netherlands. The multifactorial etiology {{of the development of}} OC is still not completely understood. Factors like exercise, genetics, exterior, housing, trauma and feeding seems to play a role. Studies show a possible influence of specific minerals, like copper, zinc and magnesium, fast growth, girth perimeter and weight of the horse on the development of OC. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the prevalence of OC of a veterinary based warmblood horse population and to search for influencing factors from feeding practice. A database was created by the retrospective use of 626 radiological examination reports of warmblood horses (age 1 – 5 y), conducted by a veterinary equine clinic. The environmental factors (housing, feeding and management practice) of the 45 farms were collected by the use of questionnaires and statistically tested for significant correlation with the OC-status of the farms. The results show a prevalence of OC of 26, 7 %, with the tarsocrural joint most affected; 13, 7 %, followed by the metatarsophalangeal joint; 6, 0 %, the metacarpophalangeal joint; 5, 6 % and the femoropatellar joint; 5, 4 %. The factors of the feeding practices of pregnant mares, <b>foals</b> before <b>weaning</b> and <b>foals</b> after <b>weaning</b> did not show any significant correlation, except of the amount of concentrates of the <b>weaned</b> <b>foals.</b> More statistical analyses are necessary for any reliable conclusions.

40|$|ABSTRACT- This {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} intake, nutrient digestibility and body weight gain of foals on diets of concentrate and legume hay. Treatments were: lucerne hay (Medicago sativa), Campo Grande stylo hay (20 % Stylosanthes macrocephala and 80 % Stylosanthes capitata) and Mineirão stylo hay (Stylosanthes guianensis cv. Mineirão). Fifteen <b>weaned</b> <b>foals</b> at 160 Kg body weight (BW) were used. The experiment was entirely randomized with three treatments and five replicates. Dry matter intake was estimated at 30 g of dry matter (DM) /kg BW and was comprised of 40 % concentrate meal and 60 % hay. Fecal production and nutrient digestibility were calculated by the LIPE ® marker methodology. There {{was no difference between}} Lucerne hay and Campo Grande stylo hay intake, but intake of Mineirão stylo hay was lower than that of Lucerne hay. Body weight gain and nutrient digestibility coefficients were similar for foals fed different diets. Intake was similar for Campo Grande and Lucerne hay, and led to similar body weight gain in diets with concentrate. Mineirão stylo hay, at 137 days of growth, was not palatable for the foals...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{compatibility}} {{and efficacy of}} the live strangles vaccine Equilis® StrepE (Intervet International, Boxmeer, the Netherlands) on pregnant mares, lactating mares and <b>weaned</b> <b>foals</b> under field conditions on a stud farm. The vaccine was tested on thirty pregnant and lactating mares (German warm-blooded and Arabian thoroughbred) between three and seventeen years of age, in a placebo controlled study. Twenty-one of these were treated with the product under test and nine were given a placebo. These mares were pregnant between three and ten months {{at the time of}} the first vaccination. The study investigates in particular the efficacy, the systemic and local compatibility as well as possible effects of vaccination on both reproduction and lactation. The passive transfer of maternal vaccine antibodies and their persistence in the foals has also been investigated. The efficacy was tested by investigating the M-protein specific serum antibody response. In order to examine the passive transfer of antibodies the SeM-specific serum antibodies of the suckling foals of the mares tested were controlled using identical procedures. The compatibility was tested by examining the site of the injection and by regular clinical controls of the probands. Pregnancy, parturition and the health condition of the newborn were subject to special supervision. Gravidity, the process of parturition and the condition of the new-born foals were subject to special supervision. During lactation, the mares, their udders and the suckling foals were clinically controlled. Fifty-four foals, both German warm-blood and Arabian thoroughbred, at an age between four and seven months, were examined to test the efficacy and the systemic and local compatibility of the vaccine. In addition, the efficacy of the immunisation of <b>weaned</b> <b>foals</b> against respiratory diseases in the early rearing time was compared with herds of unvaccinated foals. Results: •	Local and systemic compatibility with mares and foals agreed with the details given by the manufacturer. In our opinion the observed local inflammatory reactions, some of these quite severe, in about 15 % of vaccinations are not ideal and clearly show that the vaccine at the tested form has to be improved. •	When this vaccine is used the problems described by Kemp-Symonds et al. (2007), Sweeney et al. (2005) as well as Timoney (2007) should be taken into consideration. On the basis of the investigations carried out in the context of this study concerning serological issues the risk of purpura haemorrhagica (SWEENEY et al. 2005) resulting from vaccination can not be excluded. In our view this risk could be attributed to the recommendations of the manufacturer for revaccination after twelve weeks. •	Our data suggest that contrary to the recommendation by the manufacturer of vaccination intervals of twelve weeks, revaccination intervals of six months are preferable. Thereby the risk of immune-mediated vaccination complications can be avoided on the one hand; on the other hand, SeM-specific serum titres achieved by vaccination persit on a high level for this time. •	The vaccine didn’t show any negative effects with pregnant and lactating mares as to reproduction and lactation. Thus Equilis® StrepE seems to be compatible. •	The application of the vaccine with pregnant and lactating mares stimulated a serum antibody response. Foals of vaccinated mares had higher titres of SeM-specific IgG. •	The persistence of maternal SeM-specific serum antibodies in foals of mares vaccinated shortly before parturition will hold until at least the end of the fourth month of life. •	Vaccination of <b>weaned</b> <b>foals</b> with Equilis® StrepE failed to produce a measurable systemic, solid immunity and didn’t lead to a notable improvement of the disease processes of respiratory bacterial infections with the herd of foals tested in this study. Therefore the efficacy of the vaccine batch used could not be confirmed. Because of high efforts involved in vaccination, the only three-months duration of immunity, the safety issues, the frequent local vaccination reactions and the poor efficacy, a general use of Equilis® StrepE as tested form can not be recommended as a preventive measure. In order to develop an effective strangles vaccine, further studies into the complex im-munological processes concerning S. equi infections as well as the exploration of new methods to stimulate them in an effective way, are necessary. Safe vaccines offering a better and longer protection as well as a greater safety-profile are needed to prevent strangles...|$|R

40|$|Weaning is a {{standard}} procedure at most studs, and the methods of weaning varies greatly. The method used at the stud in this particular study is supposed to decrease stress. The {{purpose of the study}} was to compare the behaviour of foals in group before and after stepwise removal of their mares. Standardbred foals with their mothers were kept in three different groups at pasture (12, 11 and 11 foals, respectively, mixed sexes). They had free access to silage and the foals were fed concentrate in a creep-feeding area. By the time the foals were 5 months old, the mares were stepwise removed from the pasture. Every or every second day, 2 - 4 mares were removed, until all mares were gone. The mares were placed so that the foals could not hear or see them. The foals remained in their original group at the pasture throughout the whole weaning process. Observations were performed daily in two hour-shifts from the day before the first removal until the day after the last removal of mares. The three groups were observed for 28, 26 and 20 hours, respectively. A total of 24 different behaviours were recorded, some continuously and others every second minute. Means for periods of 14 minutes were calculated and analysed by the GLM procedure, the Statistical Analysis System. The time budgets of the three groups were very similar to each other. Also the time budgets before and after removal of mares were similar. This indicates that the foals adapted quickly to the new situation. Perhaps this quick adaptation was possible because of the otherwise familiar circumstances. On removal days, the foals without dams were both running and walking more and they were also more vocal than the foals with dams. Apparently, the foals were upset by the removal of their dams. Also on removal days, all foals, both with and without dams, spent less time resting and less time in a recumbent position. This shows that all foals in the group were disturbed on removal days. During days after removal days, the foals without dams spent less time resting alone and less time in lateral recumbency than foals with dams. This indicates that the foals without dams still had not adapted to the new situation. After removal of all mares, the total time of resting were no less than before the removal of mares, but the foals had changed their resting behaviour. Since the foals spent less time in lateral recumbency one might assume that they did not get enough of the important REM-sleep. While the foals still had access to their dams and were able to suckle, they ended the majority of the nursing bouts. This shows that the mares had not yet began to <b>wean</b> their <b>foals</b> themselves. Still twelve days after the first group had been weaned, we noticed that the foals were trying to suckle on each other. For a foal which is developing very rapidly at this age, the separation from it’s dam is a major psychological trauma. The traumatic experience may be irreversible, and will lay a foundation to the development of stereotypies. The subject of <b>weaning</b> <b>foals</b> need more research. This study show that weaning by stepwise removal of the mares from pasture, leaving the foals in a familiar surrounding, is a good weaning method. However, the timing of the weaning, at the age of five months, is too soon for the foals. When and how to <b>wean</b> the <b>foals</b> should be based on knowledge of the horse’s natural behaviour and not tradition. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} {{use of the}} macrolide antimicrobial tilmicosin in {{the horse}} was assessed by initially reviewing bacterial isolates from equine infections. This demonstrated that respiratory disease due to Gram positive organisms {{was the most common}} bacterial infection documented at WCVM. Furthermore, 45 % of Streptococcus zooepidemicus isolates were resistant to the commonly used potentiated sulphonamides. It was necessary to first develop and validate a robust HPLC analytical technique to detect tilmicosin in a variety of equine tissues. The methodology was fully validated in plasma and lung with LODs of 13 ng/mL and 181 ng/g respectively. In a preliminary trial, we administered tilmicosin to recently <b>weaned</b> <b>foals</b> at a dose of 4 mg/kg PO sid or 10 mg/kg SC q 72 hrs. The oral dose did not result in detectable tissue concentrations of tilmicosin. The pharmacokinetics of the injectable dose were similar to previous reports in other species. The injectable preparation resulted in severe swelling at the site of injection associated with edema and tissue necrosis. Otherwise, tilmicosin was well tolerated by the foals and no foals developed severe colitis. However, a semi-quantitative fecal bacteriological technique demonstrated marked changes in the normal fecal flora, with profound overgrowth of the Enterbacteriacae and almost complete removal of the normal â-hemolytic streptococci population. No known pathogens were isolated from the feces. In a subsequent study, we investigated the administration of higher doses of oral tilmicosin to unweaned foals to simulate treatment of R. equi. A dose of 40 mg/kg PO sid resulted in detectable plasma concentrations of tilmicosin. Foals were treated at this dose regimen for 2 weeks and sequentially euthanized. Tissue analysis demonstrated concentrations of tilmicosin in tissues similar to those seen with the 10 mg/kg sc dose with a Cmax of 4 µg/g in lung and a MRT which was shorter at 8. 8 hrs. The MIC 50 of R. equi to tilmicosin was 4 µg/g. Based on pharmacodynamic studies it appears that oral tilmicosin {{has the potential to be}} of use in the treatment of R. equi pneumonia in foals. No adverse clinical effects were noted in the foals; however, the fecal flora was again changed by tilmicosin administration. The fecal flora of the unweaned foals was different from that of the older animals with almost no â-haemolytic streptococci and a predominantly Gram negative flora. Disruption of the fecal flora did result in overgrowth of Cl. perfringens which was not associated with disease. In a final study, we compared the effects of tilmicosin and ceftiofur on the fecal flora of adult horses. The fecal flora of the horses receiving tilmicosin was severely disrupted in the same manner as the <b>weaned</b> <b>foals</b> with the added effect of overgrowth of Cl. perfringens. Ceftiofur which is widely regarded as being associated with antimicrobial associated diarrhea had very little effect on the fecal flora. It is concluded that oral tilmicosin shows potential for the treatment of R. equi pneumonia in young foals. However, care should be taken due to possibility of developing colitis. The drug’s use should be avoided in older horses due to the very real risk of developing acute bacterial colitis. The injectable preparation should not be used in horses due to the severity of the reaction at the injection site...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDifferent {{approaches}} {{have been investigated}} to reduce <b>weaning</b> stress in <b>foals.</b> The present study examines whether the presence of unrelated adult horses at weaning would reduce the social stress of weaning {{and the emergence of}} undesirable behaviours. This study was conducted in two sites. Subjects were 12 colts and 20 fillies from Arab (site 1), Anglo-Arab and French-Saddlebred (site 2) breeds. Weaning occurred outdoors at 4. 5 (site 1) or 7 (site 2) months of age. At both sites, foals were divided into Peer-Weaned (PW) and Adult-Weaned (AW) groups: in the formers, foals were maintained after weaning in same-age groups; in the latters, two unfamiliar adult horses were introduced following the removal of all mares. At farm 1, one PW group (nPW 1 - 1 = 5) and one AW group (nAW 1 - 1 = 4) were constituted. At farm 2, four balanced groups, 2 PW groups (nPW 2 - 1 = 6, nPW 2 - 2 = 6) and 2 AW groups (nAW 2 - 1 = 6, nAW 2 - 2 = 5), were formed. Thus, three separate trials were conducted, with each trial consisting of one AW group and one PW group. PW and AW groups were kept in separate pastures throughout the study period. Levels of salivary cortisol were measured one day before to four days after the <b>weaning</b> day. <b>Foals</b> behaviours were recorded prior to weaning and through one month post-weaning. Statistical significance was tested using non-parametric tests. In all groups, weaning was followed by increased vocalization, increased locomotion and increased salivary cortisol concentration. However, signs of stress were less pronounced and shorter in duration in weanlings with adults (e. g. whinnies: P< 0. 05; salivary cortisol: P< 0. 05). Only foals without adults exhibited for several weeks post-weaning aggressiveness towards peers (P< 0. 05) and abnormal behaviours (P< 0. 05) including excessive wood-chewing and redirected sucking towards peers. In conclusion, introducing adults to minimize <b>weaning</b> stress in <b>foals</b> and later on aggressiveness and abnormal behaviours appears as the most promising approach to date...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{method to}} reduce {{contamination}} of the bronchoscope during microbial sampling of the lower airways of foals was evaluated. Methylene blue (MB) {{was used as a}} nasopharyngeal dye marker to assess the relative contamination from the upper airways of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens obtained by standard bronchoscopy (SB) and a "guarded" bronchoscopic method (GB). For GB, a clear sterile cellulose sheath was fitted over the bronchoscope in an effort to protect the endoscope tip and channel from contamination. Methylene blue was detected visually in seven of eight BAL samples from foals following SB, but in none of the samples recovered by GB (p less than 0. 001). Significantly less MB was detected in BAL by spectrophotometry in the GB group as well (p less than 0. 02). The GB was next employed to study the microbial flora in the lower airways of healthy <b>weaned</b> <b>foals</b> (n = 30). Bacteria were isolated from 29 of 30 (97 %) BAL samples, and in moderate or large numbers from 26 of 30 (87 %) of the foals. Potential pathogens, including Bordetella bronchiseptica, Streptococcus zooepidemicus, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycoplasma felis and Streptococcus pneumoniae, were cultured from the lower airways of foals. In conclusion, the bronchoscope and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens were readily contaminated by a dye marker placed in the nasopharynx of foals, and the degree of contamination was significantly reduced by sheathing the endoscope. This contamination during bronchoscopy may obscure the interpretation of isolates from BAL specimens from foals, which may possess a bacterial flora in the lower airways without cytological evidence of inflammation.

This study {{investigated}} the effects of an artificial feeding system on the growth and welfare {{of a group of}} "Cavallo Agricolo Italian da Tiro Pesante Rapido" foals (n = 12). A viable artificial rearing method could allow for the commercial supply of mare's milk for cosmetic or pediatric purposes. Six foals were maintained on an artificial suckling (AS) regimen using a modified bovine milk replacer, and 6 remained with their dams (control group, naturally suckled [NS]). Housing and management was identical for both groups. During the 6 -month trial, the foals were weighed every 3 weeks from 4 days of age, and their daily weight gains were calculated. Foals were directly observed for 6 separate 24 -hour periods at 4, 10, 47, 114, 142, and 176 days of age, and an ethogram was compiled from the observed behaviors (resting, social, alimentary, and eliminative). All data were analyzed using a repeated measures analysis. At 4 days of age, the behavior of the AS foals was significantly {{different from that of the}} control group foals in that they stood up for longer duration (530 vs. 174 minutes, P < 0. 01), performed fewer suckling bouts (P < 0. 01), and did not play (P < 0. 01) or lick (P < 0. 05). AS foals were more aggressive and cross-suckled more (P < 0. 01) at 10 days of age than at the first observation period. After <b>weaning,</b> AS <b>foals</b> ate more concentrate and less hay than the control group foals (P < 0. 01). However, at the end of the trial, there were no significant differences between the groups in terms of weight (AS vs. NS [mean +/- standard deviation]: 350 +/- 15 vs. 360 +/- 20 kg, P = 0. 34) and daily weight gains (1630 +/- 370 vs. 1600 +/- 310 g/d, P = 0. 88). Artificial suckling techniques could be applied to Cavallo Agricolo Italian da Tiro Pesante Rapido foals, without negative effects on growth and welfare during the first 6 months of life. In fact, after an initial adaptation period, the AS foals did not exhibit any abnormal behavior or behavioral differences compared with NS foals.

Mean values for the concentration of major milk components across the lactation period (180 d) were 5. 9 g/kg of fat, 18. 4 g/ kg of protein, and 60. 8 g/kg of lactose. Milk fat and protein (g/kg) decreased and lactose (g/kg) increased during the 180 d of lactation. Curves for milk protein and lactose yields (g) were similar in shape to the milk yield curve; protein yield peaked at 307 g on d 10 and lactose peaked at 816 g on d 45. The fat (g) curve was different in shape compared with milk, protein, and lactose yields. Total production of the major milk con-stituents throughout the 180 d of lactation was esti-mated to be 12. 0, 36. 1, and 124 kg for fat, protein, and lactose, respectively. The algebraic model fitted by a nonlinear regression procedure to the data resulted in reasonable prediction curves for milk yield (R 2 a of 0. 89) and the major constituents (R 2 a ranged from 0. 89 to 0. 95). The lactation curves of major milk constituents in Lusitano mares were similar, both in shape and val-ues, to those found in other horse breeds. The estab-lished curves facilitate the estimation of milk yield and variation of milk constituents at different stages of lac-tation for both nursing and dairy mares, providing im-portant information relative to <b>weaning</b> time and <b>foal</b> supplementation.

40|$|AbstractArtificial weaning {{is often}} highly {{stressful}} for {{both mother and}} offspring. We investigated the effect of 2 different weaning and relocation schedules on growth rate and saliva cortisol concentrations {{in a group of}} loose-housed domestic horses. We predicted higher acute stress (cortisol concentrations), but a lower long-term effect on weight gain, which would indicate lower chronic stress in foals, if the foals were moved to the new environment immediately after separation from the mothers (“prompt relocation” [PR]) compared with relocation that was adjourned for a week (“stepwise relocation” [SWR]). Within 2 seasons, 56 <b>foals</b> <b>weaned</b> at age of 165 - 250 days were regularly weighed up to 140 days after weaning. Growth rate significantly differed between SWR and PR foals. The PR weanlings revealed relatively stable increase in their weights, whereas SWR foals experienced a significant drop in growth during the first 3 weeks after weaning. The weight differences were still apparent 5 months after weaning (predicted weight, least squares means ± standard error: 374. 40  ±  1. 75  kg in PR vs. 362. 71  ±  1. 66  kg in SWR foals). Cortisol concentrations changed significantly between and within different weaning procedures and were highest in PR <b>foals</b> after <b>weaning</b> and relocation. Compared with pre-weaning values, cortisol levels increased in PR but not in SWR <b>foals,</b> either after <b>weaning</b> or deferred moving. We found large individual variability in foals' growth and in cortisol concentrations for both weaning procedures. There was also a year effect in SWR foals. Stepwise changes of the physical and social environment (deferred removal to the remote facility) within a short period after abrupt weaning resulted in lower acute stress but induced long-term negative effects on foals' growth rate compared with joint weaning and relocation. Our results support rather prompt moving of the weanlings to the new facility, rather than to a stepwise location on horse breeding farms...|$|R
