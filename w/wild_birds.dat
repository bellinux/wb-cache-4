5000|$|A [...] "wild bird" [...] is: ..."Any bird of {{a species}} which is ordinarily {{resident}} in or is a visitor to the European territory of any member state in a wild state but does not include poultry or, except in sections 5 and 16, any game bird." [...] It is an offence to kill, injure, or take any <b>wild</b> <b>bird,</b> to have possession of a <b>wild</b> <b>bird</b> (alive or dead) or any part of a <b>wild</b> <b>bird,</b> to obstruct or prevent any <b>wild</b> <b>bird</b> from using its nest, to take or destroy a <b>wild</b> <b>bird's</b> egg, to have possession of a <b>wild</b> <b>bird's</b> egg or any part of an egg. It is also an offence to keep or confine a <b>wild</b> <b>bird</b> in a cage or other receptacle in which it cannot stretch its wings freely.|$|R

5|$|Up to {{at least}} the nineteenth century the song thrush was kept as a cage bird because of its melodious voice. As with hunting, there is little {{evidence}} that the taking of <b>wild</b> <b>birds</b> for aviculture has had a significant effect on wild populations.|$|E

5|$|In cold or inclement weather, several {{nightjar}} {{species can}} slow their metabolism {{and go into}} torpor, notably the common poorwill, which will maintain that state for weeks. The European nightjar has been observed in captivity {{to be able to}} maintain a state of torpor for at least eight days without harm, but the relevance of this to <b>wild</b> <b>birds</b> is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Individual F. aurea {{trees are}} common on dairy farms in La Cruz, Cañitas and Santa Elena in Costa Rica, {{since they are}} often spared when forest is {{converted}} to pasture.

5|$|Moult {{is poorly}} recorded, the only records coming from Sakhalin and Himachal Pradesh. In Sakhalin, moult occurs in August and September, between the {{breeding}} season and migration. In Himachal Pradesh, aviculturalist G. A.

5|$|The natural {{hosts of}} {{influenza}} viruses are pigs and birds, {{although it has}} probably infected humans since antiquity. The virus can cause mild to severe epizootics in wild and domesticated animals. Many species of <b>wild</b> <b>birds</b> migrate and this has spread influenza across the continents throughout the ages. The virus has evolved into numerous strains and continues to do so, posing an ever-present threat.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{other birds}} on the island, {{the species is}} not hunted, and is {{protected}} under Schedule 1 of Nauru's <b>Wild</b> <b>Birds</b> Preservation Ordinance 1937. For conservation purposes, the IUCN recommends regular surveys {{of the population and}} the establishment of a monitoring programme through training local people. It also proposed raising conservation awareness by increasing the profile of the bird.|$|E
5|$|If Hahn's {{account is}} disregarded, the Mascarene parrot {{probably}} became extinct prior to 1800. The last account of wild specimens on Réunion {{is from the}} 1770s. It is thought that the Mascarene parrot went extinct in the wild while captive specimens still survived in Europe, since specimens {{are known to have}} lived there after the last mention of <b>wild</b> <b>birds.</b> In the 1790s, French author, explorer, and naturalist François Levaillant stated that the bird was rare and that he had seen three specimens in France.|$|E

5|$|The American kestrel is not long-lived, with a {{lifespan}} of <5 {{years for}} <b>wild</b> <b>birds.</b> The oldest banded wild bird was 11 years and 7 months, while captive kestrels can {{live up to}} 14–17 years. In a study, humans accounted for 43.2% of 1,355 reported deaths, which included direct killing and roadkills, while predation (including by larger birds of prey) accounted for 2.8%. This statistic is likely biased, however, as reported deaths are usually found near or in areas populated by humans.|$|E
5|$|As of May 2017, {{there are}} 18 Local Nature Reserves in Northamptonshire, {{and there is}} public access to all sites. Twelve are managed by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire, and two are also Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Ramsar internationally {{important}} wetland sites, and Special Protection Areas under the European Union Directive on the Conservation of <b>Wild</b> <b>Birds.</b> The largest site is Titchmarsh Nature Reserve at , which has nationally important numbers of goosanders, wigeons and gadwalls in winter. The smallest is Great Oakley Meadow, which has prominent surviving ridge and furrow from the medieval ploughing system.|$|E
5|$|Both {{intensive}} and free-range farming have animal welfare concerns. In intensive systems, cannibalism, feather pecking and vent pecking can be common, with some farmers using beak trimming as a preventative measure. Diseases {{can also be}} common and spread rapidly through the flock. In extensive systems, the birds are exposed to adverse weather conditions and are vulnerable to predators and disease-carrying <b>wild</b> <b>birds.</b> Barn systems {{have been found to}} have the worst bird welfare. In Southeast Asia, a lack of disease control in free-range farming has been associated with outbreaks of avian influenza.|$|E
