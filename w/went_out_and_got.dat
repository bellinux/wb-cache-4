500|$|Holloway {{highlighted}} Michael's {{review of}} Angela, wherein {{he tells her}} [...] "You're adequate", as the best line in the episode. TV Fanatic reviewed several of the quotes for the episode. The site ranked Angela's monologue about how much she loves being judged, as well as Jim's revelation that Dwight thinks a Thursday is really a Friday, a four out of five. TV Fanatic awarded the conversation between Stanley and Michael—wherein Stanley tells Michael how to properly listen for subtext in a voicemail—as well as Dwight's frustration that he <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>got</b> drunk with his laser tag team, a five out of five. Wilson later claimed that Dwight's line about laser tag caused [...] "quite a buzz" [...] online.|$|E

I did {{something}} I virtually never do, as I said much earlier: I <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>got</b> drunk. Outside in the Dunedin night {{the rain was}} trickling down the windows and the wind was blowing. It was cold and horrible, which exactly reflected my mood. The drops of rain on the windows could have been tears in my soul." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wolford’s agent, Ralph Cindrich, {{later said}} that at least four other teams {{had been willing to}} match the Colts’ offer. [...] What had set the Colts apart from the other bidders was a clause they agreed to insert into Wolford’s new contract. [...] It {{guaranteed}} that Will Wolford, left tackle, would remain the highest paid player on the Colts’ offense {{for as long as he}} played on it. [...] Better paid than the Colts’ running backs, the Colts’ wide receivers, or any of the other acknowledged stars. [...] Even if the Colts <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>got</b> themselves the NFL’s most expensive quarterback, Wolford’s salary would rise to eclipse his, too. [...] “I thought linemen would get a little more money from free agency,” said Wolford later. [...] “But I didn’t think that would happen. [...] I was numb.” ...|$|E

It cut me to the heart to do it, but I had decided to give him his way and let those purple socks pass out of my life. After all, there are times when a cove must make sacrifices. I was just going to nip back and break the glad news to him, when the lift came up, so I thought I would leave it till I got home.|$|R

25|$|From 1918 to 1919, actor James Cagney {{worked in}} the New York City Wanamaker's Store as a package wrapper, while {{trying to get his}} Broadway career started.

As it was growing late, Peggotty and Mr. Dick took that {{opportunity}} of repairing to the chandler's shop together. I parted from him, poor fellow, {{at the corner}} of the street, with his great kite at his back, a very monument of human misery.|$|E
6000|$|Roberts: [...] "Of course I didn't see her. How should I see her, when I {{never saw}} her before? I went up and spoke to her, {{and she said she}} wasn't the one. She was very angry, and she <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>got</b> her husband. He was tipsy, and he's been coming back ever since. I don't {{know what to do about}} the wretched creature.

60|$|He <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> had <b>got</b> rid of {{the slight}} uneasiness the {{interview}} had occasioned him before he reached the water-front, where he found Mrs. Nairn and Evelyn awaiting him with Carroll in attendance. In another few minutes they were rowing off to the sloop, and as they approached her the elder lady glanced with approval at the craft, which swam, a gleaming ivory shape, upon the shining green brine.|$|R

But I think it's coming on; I think that crying last night meant something, {{one way or}} the other. Well, we shall see; we shall see. I will be off back again to my work now; I feel all the better for having had this talk with you. Hesba's a good woman, and she is fond of the child; but she is what she calls practical--she looks at things hard, and straight, and sensible, and naturally she don't quite enter into my feelings about Ruth, though she is fond of her too. Well, good morning, Mr. Armstrong; you have done me good, and I do hope it will turn out as you say, and that we shall get to know what is Ruth's trouble." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{his mother}} again {{left him with}} the {{understanding}} that he was to be allowed to remain in bed till the next morning; but that he was to give her some further explanation when he had been refreshed and invigorated after his own prescription. The boy <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>got</b> him soda water and brandy, and meat was carried up to him, and then he did succeed for a while in finding oblivion from his misery in sleep.|$|E

6000|$|... "On the {{following}} Monday, Josiah wrote {{to say that}} he had bought the laundry. On Tuesday I read in the Commercial Intelligence {{that one of the most}} remarkable features of the time was the marvellous rise taking place all over New England in the value of hotel and bar property. On Thursday, in the list of failures, I came across no less than four laundry proprietors; and the paper added, in explanation, that the American washing industry, owing to the rapid growth of Chinese competition, was practically on its last legs. I <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>got</b> drunk.|$|E
60|$|On Christmas day {{the boys}} {{received}} {{a number of}} valuable presents and gave everybody presents in return. There was a grand family dinner, such as only their aunt Martha could prepare, and it is needless {{to say that all}} did full justice to the spread. After dinner the lads <b>went</b> <b>out</b> snowballing <b>and</b> <b>got</b> Aleck Pop <b>and</b> Jack Ness to do the same. The boys snowballed the colored man and Jack Ness so vigorously that the pair had to run for the barn.|$|R
5000|$|Once the {{qualifying}} {{session was}} completed, Logano stated, [...] "The track was dirty.

So I felt like I left a tenth and a half a second or so right there, but I felt like I nailed Turns 2 and 3 pretty well. I was hoping {{it would be in the}} top five, and it ended up being good enough." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} grew up very fresh and alert, with zest for {{every moment of}} life. He worked and rode and drove to market, he <b>went</b> <b>out</b> with companions <b>and</b> <b>got</b> tipsy {{occasionally}} <b>and</b> played skittles {{and went to the}} little travelling theatres. Once, when he was drunk at a public house, he went upstairs with a prostitute who seduced him. He was then nineteen.|$|R
60|$|He {{went back}} into the sitting-room and, {{surveying}} the scene, wondered what to do; he had not the heart to begin trying to set things straight; besides there was no food in the house, and he was hungry. He <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>got</b> himself something to eat. When he came in he was cooler. A little pang seized him as he thought of the child, and he wondered whether she would miss him, at first perhaps, but in a week she would have forgotten him; and he was thankful to be rid of Mildred. He did not think of her with wrath, but with an overwhelming sense of boredom.|$|E
6000|$|... "Monday, {{there were}} the odd jobs about the house to be begun. He was by this time just sober enough to do his work, and just tipsy enough to take a spiteful {{pleasure}} in persecuting his wife. He <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>got</b> the things he wanted, and came back and called for me. A skilled workman like he was (he said) wanted a journeyman under him. There were things which it was beneath a skilled workman to do for himself. He {{was not going to}} call in a man or a boy, and then have to pay them. He was going to get it done for nothing, and he meant to make a journeyman of me. Half tipsy and half sober, he went on talking like that, and laying out his things, all quite right, as he wanted them. When they were ready he straightened himself up, and he gave me his orders what I was to do.|$|E
60|$|Atterbury got to liking me and Buck and he {{begun to}} throw {{on the canvas}} for {{us some of the}} schemes that had caused his hair to evacuate. He had one scheme for {{starting}} a National bank on $45 that made the Mississippi Bubble look as solid as a glass marble. He talked this to us for three days, and when his throat was good and sore we told him about the roll we had. Atterbury borrowed a quarter from us and <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>got</b> a box of throat lozenges and started all over again. This time he talked bigger things, and he got us to see 'em as he did. The scheme he laid out looked like a sure winner, and he talked me and Buck into putting our capital against his burnished dome of thought. It looked all right for a kid-gloved graft. It seemed to be just about {{an inch and a half}} outside of the reach of the police, and as money-making as a mint. It was just what me and Buck wanted--a regular business at a permanent stand, with an open air spieling with tonsilitis on the street corners every evening.|$|E
500|$|Cy Grant, a Guyanese actor {{selected}} {{for the role of}} Lieutenant Green (Colonel White's assistant and Cloudbase's main computer operator and public announcer), had been known to the Andersons for singing topical calypsos on the current affairs programme Tonight. His casting influenced the decision to accept Edward Bishop as Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet's friend and mission partner), as Bishop recalled in an interview recorded in 1995: [...] "It was just that a girl in my agent's office happened to be on the ball. She represented this black actor by the name of Cy Grant and Gerry and Sylvia wanted to use him... And the girl said, 'Oh, by the way, Mr Anderson, we've just taken on a new, young American actor' – shows you how long ago it was – 'a new American actor, name of Edward Bishop.And we know how much you like American voices. Would you like to meet him as well?' He said, 'Okay, send him out.' So I <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> auditioned <b>and</b> <b>got</b> the job." ...|$|R
60|$|But, sadly {{enough for}} the {{destitute}} orphans, a new President came in just at this time, Buchanan <b>and</b> Floyd <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> they never <b>got</b> their money. The first thing Congress did in 1861 was to rescind the resolution of June 1, 1860, under which Mr. Floyd had been ciphering. Then Floyd (and doubtless the heirs of George Fisher likewise) {{had to give up}} financial business for a while, and go into the Confederate army and serve their country.|$|R

6000|$|... "We have {{discovered}} nothing. I {{was in the}} room watching with the Nurse. Earlier in the evening I fancied that the mummy smells were making me drowsy, so I <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>got</b> a respirator. I had it on when I came on duty; but it did not keep me from going to sleep. I awoke to see the room full of people; that is, Miss Trelawny and Sergeant Daw, being only half awake and still stupefied by the same scent or influence which had affected us, fancied that he saw something moving through the shadowy darkness of the room, and fired twice. When I rose out of my chair, with my face swathed in the respirator, he took me for the cause of the trouble. Naturally enough, he was about to fire again, when I was fortunately in time to manifest my identity. Mr. Trelawny was lying beside the safe, just as he was found last night; and was bleeding profusely from the new wound in his wrist. We lifted him on the sofa, and made a tourniquet. That is, literally and absolutely, all that any of us know as yet. We have not touched the knife, which you see lies close by the pool of blood. Look!" [...] I said, going over and lifting it. [...] "The point is red with the blood which has dried." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was weak}} and hungry, {{and my mind}} kept on {{behaving}} like a beetle on a pin, tremendous activity and nothing done {{at the end of}} it. Come round just where it was before. There was sorrowing for the other chaps, beastly drunkards certainly, but not deserving such a fate, and young Sanders with the spear through his neck wouldn't go out of my mind. There was the treasure down there in the Ocean Pioneer, and how one might get it and hide it somewhere safer, and get away and come back for it. And there was the puzzle where to get anything to eat. I tell you I was fair rambling. I was afraid to ask by signs for food, for fear of behaving too human, and so there I sat and hungered until very near the dawn. Then the village got a bit quiet, and I couldn't stand it any longer, and I <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>got</b> some stuff like artichokes in a bowl and some sour milk. What was left of these I put away among the other offerings, just to give them a hint of my tastes. And in the morning they came to worship, and found me sitting up stiff and respectable on their previous god, just as they'd left me overnight. I'd got my back against the central pillar of the hut, and, practically, I was asleep. And that's how I became a god among the heathen--a false god no doubt, and blasphemous, but one can't always pick and choose.|$|E
60|$|Having so spoken, {{waiting to}} see the effect of his indignation, the priest <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> <b>and</b> <b>got</b> upon his horse, and went away upon his journey. The young lord {{knew that he had}} been insulted, was aware that words had been said to him so severe that one man, in his rank of life, rarely utters them to another; and he had stood the while with his face turned to the wall {{speechless}} and sobbing! The priest had gone, telling him to leave the house because his presence disgraced it; and he had made no answer. Yet he was the Earl of Scroope,--the thirteenth Earl of Scroope,--a man in his own country full of honours. Why had he come there to be called a villain? And why was the world so hard upon him that on hearing himself so called he could only weep like a girl? Had he done worse than other men? Was he not willing to make any retribution for his fault,--except by doing that which he had been taught to think would be a greater fault? As he left the house he tried to harden his heart against Kate O'Hara. The priest had lied to him about her father. They must have known that the man was alive. They had caught him among them, and the priest's anger {{was a part of the}} net with which they had intended to surround him. The stake for which they had played had been very great. To be Countess of Scroope was indeed a chance worth some risk. Then, as he breasted the hill up towards the burial ground, he tried to strengthen his courage by realizing the magnitude of his own position. He bade himself remember that he was among people who were his inferiors in rank, education, wealth, manners, religion and nationality. He had committed an error. Of course he had been in fault. Did he wish to escape the consequences of his own misdoing? Was not his presence there so soon after the assumption of his family honours sufficient evidence of his generous admission of the claims to which he was subject? Had he not offered to sacrifice himself as no other man would have done? But they were still playing for the high stakes. They were determined that the girl should be Countess of Scroope. He was determined that she should not be Countess of Scroope. He was still willing to sacrifice himself, but his family honours he would not pollute.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the racial}} and social {{implications}} of R and {{country at the}} time, Charles {{did not agree with}} contemporary views of race records and other genres, including pop and country, as essentially different. In an interview with Ben Fong-Torres of Rolling Stone, Charles said of the similarities between the blues and country music, [...] "he words to country songs are very earthy like the blues, see, very down. They're not as dressed up, and the people are very honest and say, 'Look, I miss you, darlin', so I <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> I <b>got</b> drunk in this bar.' That's the way you say it. Where in Tin Pan Alley will say, 'Oh, I missed you darling, so I went to this restaurant and I sat down and I had dinner for one.' That's cleaned up now, you see? But country songs and the blues is like it is." ...|$|R
50|$|On {{the first}} play of the second quarter Florida State took the lead off of a direct snap to Lorenzo Booker that he ran into the endzone, giving the Seminoles the lead. Florida State got the ball back after forcing Miami to punt. Greg Jones had a 24-yard run during the Seminoles {{possession}} {{to set up a}} Chris Rix touchdown pass to Matt Henshaw. Florida State now had a 14-3 lead. On Miami's ensuing possession Jarrett Payton took a handoff on third and two for 47 yards. The Hurricanes would get another five yards off a penalty to put them on the Seminoles 25-yard line. Three plays later Tyrone Moss ran into the endzone on a 3-yard rush. Aided by a five-yard penalty the Hurricanes were able to get the Seminoles to <b>go</b> three <b>and</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>got</b> the ball back with three minutes and forty four seconds at their own 24-yard line. After a penalty on the Hurricanes, Brock Berlin found wide receiver Ryan Moore open for a 41-yard gain putting the Hurricanes on the Seminoles 35-yard line.

We played at the Sea Witch on Sunset Blvd. as the Crossing Guards. We were a power trio, and then John and Barbara joined back up with us and we changed our name to the PBC.

But the old woman told him that was no use, and that he was put back now, and it might be twelve nights before he'd get her. But on the fourth night he got the third bit of blackthorn, and he took her, and she came away with him. He never told the mother he had got her; but one day she saw her at a fair, and, says she, [...] "That's my daughter; I know her by the smile and by the laugh of her," [...] and she with a shawl about her head. So the husband said, [...] "You're right there, and hard I worked to get her."

And she used to be able to see her husband when he came to look for her, and she was greatly afraid he'd get a drop of the wine, for then he would have come underground and never left it again.
