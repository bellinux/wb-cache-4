500|$|New York Times public editor (ombudsman) Elizabeth Spayd {{wrote in}} 2016 that [...] "Conservatives and even many moderates, see in The Times a blue-state worldview" [...] and accuse it of {{harboring}} a liberal bias. Spayd did not analyze {{the substance of}} the claim, but did opine that the Times is [...] "part of a fracturing media environment that reflects a fractured country. That in turn leads liberals and conservatives toward separate news sources." [...] Times executive editor Dean Baquet stated that he does not believe coverage has a liberal bias, but that: [...] "We have to be really careful that people feel like they can see themselves in The New York Times. I <b>want</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> perceived as fair and honest to the world, not just a segment of it. It's a really difficult goal. Do we pull it off all the time? No." ...|$|E

Speaking to the Oxford Union on the alleged overshadowing of the EU debate by [...] "UKIP and Tory backbenchers", he said:I took {{the view that}} having fought [...] that we should now work with them, and co-operate, {{and that was my}} first thought about it. Then how I saw how the European Union was developing, it was very obvious that what they had in mind was not democratic. ... And the way that Europe has developed is that the bankers and the multinational corporations have got very powerful positions, and if you come in on their terms, they will tell you what you can and cannot do. And that is unacceptable. My view about the European Union has always been not that I am hostile to foreigners, but that I am in favour of democracy ... I think they're building an empire there, they <b>want</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a part of their empire and I don't want that.|$|E

The season's executive producers were series creator Stephen Hillenburg and Paul Tibbitt, who also acted as the series' showrunner. On March 13, 2008, during the broadcast of the sixth season, the network renewed the show for a seventh season, with 26 episodes in order. Cyma Zarghami, president of Nickelodeon & MTVN Kids and Family Group, said, [...] "The strength of the Nickelodeon brand comes from how we embrace everything important to kids, and how we are with them virtually everywhere they <b>want</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> Our open philosophy to give audiences access to everything they love, and our commitment to making relevant and innovative content, have put us at the top of cable, VOD and online. Nickelodeon has strong momentum as a brand and as a business, and we have a great foundation built on great talent and relationships with some of the best creative leaders in our industry." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1989, Summer and her husband, Bruce Sudano, {{had been}} in talks to do {{a new kind of}} reality-based sitcom. It would be based on their own hectic household. At the time, they lived with their {{children}} Amanda, Brooklyn and Mimi, two sets of in-laws, and a maid. The television network started changing the premise of the show, making it less funny, says Sudano, [...] "And because we were an interracial couple, they didn't <b>want</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> married anymore". In 1989, this was [...] "an issue. So with that mentality we just backed out of it." ...|$|E

However, Blackmore leaves, compelling Torque to follow him. [...] They return to where Torque grew up; Garvey Children's Home. Inside, Torque remembers meeting Blackmore {{for the first}} time. However, in his memory, Blackmore is an adult, Torque is a child, {{and none of the}} staff can see or hear Blackmore. Blackmore then confronts Torque, telling him that the ties that bind them can never be cut. Torque realizes the truth - Blackmore is not real, he is Torque's alter ego. When Torque blacks out, Blackmore's personality takes over, but now, Blackmore wants to be in control all the time; [...] "we've only got the one body, and I'm tired of sharing." [...] He transforms into a monster, and he and Torque fight, with Torque defeating him.

2500|$|In October 2002, Lawrence MacAulay {{was forced}} to resign as Solicitor General {{following}} a ruling from the ethics counselor Howard Wilson that MacAulay had broken conflict-of-interest rules by lobbying the government to fund a police training scheme at Holland College, which was headed by his brother. Both Chrétien and his close associate man Eddie Goldenberg saw the charges against MacAulay as absurd, with Chrétien telling Wilson [...] "Do you <b>want</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> eunuchs in our jobs?" [...] On November 21, 2002, Chrétien's communications director Françoise Ducros was overheard by Robert Fife saying about President Bush [...] "What a moron!", who reported the remark in the next day's edition of The National Post. The next day, Chrétien told the press that Bush was a friend and [...] "He's not a moron at all", leading to headlines in the press such as [...] "Chrétien denies Bush is a moron". Chrétien was highly reluctant to fire Ducros, who was one of his most loyal supporters. That Ducros was especially hated by the Martin fraction of the Liberals was another reason why Chrétien did not wish to fire Ducros, despite the media storm she had provoked. Finally, under strong pressure from the American government, which had quietly {{made it clear that the}} continued presence of Ducros would not help Canadian-American relations, Chrétien dismissed Ducros on November 26, 2002. Ducros's successor as communications director, Jim Munson, was a former journalist and a better-liked personality, which led to a marked improvement in the Chrétien government's relations with the media in its last year.|$|E
