5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with shots of New York City, and then has Hamasaki on a rooftop. Hamasaki is then singing the track with several different camera angles circulating her and the city. During the first verse, it has her in an apartment, sitting on a couch with a butterfly hair clip; this scene is used throughout the entire video. It then has three shots of her in different clothes; one with a brown leather jacket, brown <b>wig</b> <b>and</b> cowboy hat, the second with a red dress on, and the third with a black jacket and crop hair style. The shot {{with her in the}} brown leather jacket, brown <b>wig</b> <b>and</b> cowboy hat then shows her on a rooftop singing the song. The final pre-chorus and chorus has her driving through New York City, and has her in a pink dress watching the snow fall; it ends with her in the red dress, holding her hands out for the snow to fall. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album A Best (2016).|$|E
5|$|Reich– who {{had known}} Hoyle since the late 1990s– was in the audience, and enjoyed the {{chemistry}} between the two actors, suggesting that they appear in a feature film together. Over {{the course of a}} day, he filmed three shorts starring Hoyle and Ryder, in which they explored some of the scenarios and themes that made it into Uncle David. In these shorts Hoyle wore a <b>wig</b> <b>and</b> makeup, which were omitted from the later feature. The two actors continued to develop their characters through a series of text messages and phone conversations.|$|E
5|$|Shooting of {{the film}} began on May 13, 1957, with the newly created choreography. Presley's {{characteristic}} hairstyle and sideburns were covered with a <b>wig</b> <b>and</b> makeup for the scenes in musical number and those set in the jail. During the performance, one of Presley's dental caps fell out and became lodged in his lung. He {{was taken to the}} Cedars of Lebanon Hospital, where he spent the night after the cap was removed. Shooting was resumed the next day. Throughout the film, Presley mimed the songs, which had been previously recorded in the studio and were added to the finished scenes.|$|E

It portrayed Madonna in a blond bob <b>wig</b> <b>and</b> a leather ensemble singing the song {{in front of a}} number of neon signs. The video also featured dancers who performed the physical discipline parkour. It was also incorporated in her Confessions Tour, where Madonna and her dancers jumped around the stage actively, while singing the song. The song was used in the movie The Devil Wears Prada (2005) and the Ugly Betty season 2 finale.|$|E
5|$|Manning {{copied the}} files from her laptop to an SD card for her camera, {{so that she}} could take it with her to the United States while on R leave. Army {{investigators}} later found the SD card in Manning's basement room in her aunt's home, in Potomac, Maryland. On January 23, Manning flew to the United States via Germany, for two weeks of leave. It was during this visit that she first went out dressed as a woman, wearing a <b>wig</b> <b>and</b> makeup. After her arrest, her former partner, Tyler Watkins, told Wired that Manning had said during the visit that she had found some sensitive information and was considering leaking it.|$|E
5|$|According to the Mexican authorities, {{the murder}} plot was {{possibly}} {{carried out with}} the collaboration of the Tijuana Cartel because no security measures were taken during the party and because the entrances were {{open to the public}} (when they are usually closed for private events). The investigation was further {{complicated by the fact that}} many of the invitees—fearing for their lives—fled from the scene when Francisco Rafael was killed by the clown. Out of the 80 to 100 attendees, only 20 of them stayed, many of them family members and employees of the banquet hall. When the authorities interrogated those who stayed and asked them whether they had recognized the assassin or any other physical features, none of them were able to give any details. Some stated that they did not even pay attention to the clown when he entered the crime scene, while others stated that they did not even recall exactly what the clown was wearing, remembering only that the assassin was wearing a blue-stripped or purple shirt, a multicolored <b>wig,</b> <b>and</b> a red clown nose.|$|E

5|$|Stigwood and Russell {{decided to}} hold auditions with the eight actresses portraying Eva in the musical's {{worldwide}} productions, with an undisclosed number performing screen tests in New York and London. In November 1981, Russell continued holding screen tests at Elstree Studios. Karla DeVito {{was among those who}} auditioned for the role of Eva. Russell also travelled to London, where he screen tested Liza Minnelli wearing a blonde <b>wig</b> <b>and</b> custom-period gowns. He felt that Minnelli, a more established film actress, would be better suited for the role, but Rice, Stigwood and Paramount wanted Elaine Paige, the first actress to play Eva in the London stage production. Russell began working on his own screenplay without Stigwood, Rice or Lloyd Webber's approval. His script followed the outlines of the stage production, but established the character of Ché as a newspaper reporter. The script also contained a hospital montage for Eva and Ché, in which they pass each other on gurneys in white corridors as she is being treated for cancer, while Ché is beaten and injured by rioters. Russell was ultimately fired from the project after telling Stigwood he would not do the film without Minnelli.|$|E
5|$|The clip {{opens with}} Lopez and her love {{interest}} conversing {{on the side}} walk {{in front of a}} shop window. These scenes are intercut with that of suspicious men in a van, observing Lopez and her lover. Later, Lopez and her lover split and she starts singing as she walks down the street. She goes inside a boutique and enters through at a secret door. As she enters, she takes off a <b>wig</b> <b>and</b> changes her clothing. She enters in a room where there are pictures of her lover scattered across a table. These scenes are intercut with scenes of Lopez and her lover laying in a grass. As the video progresses, Lopez is seen sad, accompanied with her love interest and his friend in an apartment; they are observing from a window with binoculars. It is revealed that the men {{from the beginning of the}} video are FBI officers and they are entering the building abruptly. They break into Lopez and her lover's apartment and arrest him. In the end, it is revealed that Lopez is an undercover FBI agent who surrenders her boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|On 24 April 1999, Kouao and Victoria Climbié left France and {{travelled}} to the United Kingdom, {{where they}} settled in Ealing, west London. They had a reservation in a bed and breakfast at Twyford Crescent, Acton, where they lived until 1 May 1999, when they moved to Nicoll Road, Harlesden, in the London Borough of Brent. On 25 April 1999, Kouao and Climbié visited Esther Ackah, a distant relative of Kouao by marriage, and a midwife, counsellor and preacher. Ackah and her daughter noted that Climbié was wearing a <b>wig</b> <b>and</b> looked small and frail. On 26 April 1999, Kouao and Climbié visited the Homeless Persons' Unit of Ealing Council, where they were seen by Julie Winter, a homeless persons' officer. Together, Kouao and Winter completed a housing application form. Kouao explained that Climbié was wearing a wig because she had short hair, an explanation accepted by Winter. Although Winter was shown Climbié's passport (with a photograph of Anna), she {{paid no attention to}} them, believing that Kouao's application was ineligible on the grounds of habitual residence. Winter confirmed her decision with her duty senior and told Kouao that she was not eligible for housing. She telephoned the referral across to Pamela Fortune, a social worker in Ealing's Acton referral and assessment team. She did not produce a written or electronic documentation of the referral, however, something which would have helped in double-checking the accounts that Kouao gave.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Carey driving up {{to a large}} movie theater, the Los Angeles Theatre in {{downtown}} Los Angeles, with several of her female friends. As they {{pull up to the}} front doors, they tell Carey that her boyfriend is inside with another woman, leading her to try to convince them to abort the plan of confrontation. After convincing her, they enter the theater and begin a series of small dance routines alongside some of the theater employees. As the music begins, scenes of them dancing and Carey entering the movie projection room inter-cut. Carey sits behind her boyfriend (played by Jerry O'Connell) and the woman he is cheating with, and spy on them in a comedic way with her female lackeys. Soon after, the still unidentified woman walks towards the bathroom, prompting Carey to follow her during a short interlude in the video. After running into each other by the washroom, the woman appears to be Carey sporting a short brown <b>wig</b> <b>and</b> red seductive clothing. Carey pokes her, starting a large brawl in between the two women. Afterwards, Carey appears to have defeated the woman named Bianca, and heads back towards the movie room. During this scene, Jay-Z's rap verse is played, while an animated clip of Jay-Z and Carey is projected onto the screen. Later a version of the video leaked where Jay-Z was rapping his verse in a jacuzzi. During the verse, Carey's friends begin throwing popcorn and other candies at O'Connell, prompting a small food fight in between them. As they halt their attack on him, Carey walks towards O'Connell's seat and acts as though she is Bianca. After she sits next to him and he notices who it is, Carey spills a large soda on his lap and bids him farewell, leaving the theater with her friends smiling.|$|E
25|$|Hasidic {{women wear}} {{clothing}} {{adhering to the}} principles of modest dress in Jewish law. This includes long, conservative skirts and sleeves past the elbow, as well as covered necklines. Also, the women wear stockings to cover their legs; in some Hasidic groups, such as Satmar or Toldot Aharon, the stockings must be opaque. In keeping with Jewish law, married women cover their hair, using either a sheitel (wig), a tichel (headscarf), a shpitzel, a snood, a hat, or a beret. In some Hasidic groups, such as Satmar, women may wear two headcoverings – a <b>wig</b> <b>and</b> a scarf, or a <b>wig</b> <b>and</b> a hat.|$|E
