40|$|ABSTRACTWest <b>Nile</b> <b>encephalitis</b> (WNE) {{presents}} clinically as aseptic meningitis, meningoencephalitis, encephalitis, or acute flaccid paralysis. Non-specific laboratory findings, e. g., leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, accompany WNE. Lymphopenia {{is marked}} and prolonged with WNE. Three patients with WNE {{were found to}} have elevated serum ferritin levels. Severity seemed to be directly related to serum ferritin levels. Although preliminary, the results suggested that serum ferritin levels > 500 ng/mL (normal range 5 – 187 ng/mL) occur late with WNE, and not in a control group of patients with viral meningitis or encephalitis...|$|R

50|$|West Nile fever is a mosquito-borne {{infection}} by the West Nile virus. Approximately 80% of West Nile virus {{infections in}} humans have {{few or no}} symptoms. In the cases where symptoms do occur—termed West Nile fever in cases without neurological disease—the time from infection to the appearance of symptoms is typically between 2 and 15 days. Symptoms may include fever, headaches, feeling tired, muscle pain or aches, nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, and rash. Less than 1% of the cases are severe and result in neurological disease when {{the central nervous system}} is affected. People of advanced age, the very young, or those with immunosuppression, either medically induced, such as those taking immunosuppressive drugs, or due to a pre-existing medical condition such as HIV infection, are most susceptible. The specific neurological diseases that may occur are <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>encephalitis,</b> which causes inflammation of the brain, West Nile meningitis, which causes inflammation of the meninges, which are the protective membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord, West Nile meningoencephalitis, which causes inflammation of the brain and also the meninges surrounding it, and West Nile poliomyelitis—spinal cord inflammation, which results in a syndrome similar to polio, which may cause acute flaccid paralysis.|$|E

It {{is closely related to}} St. Louis encephalitis virus found in the United States. 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Before August 1999, West Nile virus had never been reported in the United States. In 1999, 62 cases of severe disease and 7 deaths occurred in New York (including one death of a Canadian infected in New York). No reliable estimates are available for the number of cases of <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>encephalitis</b> that occur worldwide. 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on infected birds, which may circulate the virus in their blood for a few days.

40|$|West Nile virus (WNV), {{a member}} of the Flaviviridae family of RNA viruses, was first {{introduced}} to the United States in 1999 with rapid transmission across a variety of hosts throughout the continental states. Genetic research to identify genes involved in resistance and susceptibility to WNV began in mice, where it was observed that natural populations were resistant or fatally susceptible. Further investigation led to the identification of the Flavivirus resistance gene as the oligoadenylate synthetase 1 b gene in mice. A nonsense mutation was found within the coding region of this gene that associated absolutely with susceptibility to WNV. A two-stage association study was conducted to identify similar genetic associations to <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>encephalitis</b> in naturally susceptible and resistant populations of horses in the United States. Genomic sequence of a majority of the equine 2 ?, 5 ?-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS 1) gene was assembled by shotgun-sequencing CHORI BAC 100 :I 10 (3. 95 X). A contig map spanning the entire gene was constructed, including 8 kilobases of promoter sequence upstream of the first exon. Coding regions of equine OAS 1 and ribonuclease L (RNASEL) genes, as well as the OAS 1 promoter, were screened for mutations from a random sample of horses of multiple breeds. Numerous polymorphisms were identified for case-control analyses. Analysis using Fisher?s Exact test identified allelic and genotypic associations. Odds ratios were also determined to measure strength of the associations. Case-control analysis of haplotype frequencies identified significant differences in haplotype frequencies between populations and association to <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>encephalitis.</b> A conserved interferon-stimulated response element was mapped to within 518 basepairs upstream of the transcription start site of OAS 1. Promoter polymorphisms were not found to affect induction by interferon-tau; however, additional analyses are necessary to further characterize the equine OAS 1 promoter and the host factors involved in regulating expression. Statistical analyses of the genotype data from the case and control populations identified significant associations between polymorphisms of the OAS 1 and RNASEL genes with severe <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>encephalitis.</b> The similarity between human and horse OAS immunity genes suggests that the horse may provide a genetic model to further investigate mammalian SNP-associated viral susceptibility...|$|E

40|$|West Nile virus (WNV) {{can cause}} fatal murine and human encephalitis. The viral {{envelope}} protein interacts with host cells. A murine brain cDNA phage display library was therefore probed with WNV envelope protein, resulting {{in the identification of}} several adherent peptides. Of these, peptide 1 prevented WNV infection in vitro with a 50 % inhibition concentration of 67 μM and also inhibited infection of a related flavivirus, dengue virus. Peptide 9, a derivative of peptide 1, was a particularly potent inhibitor of WNV in vitro, with a 50 % inhibition concentration of 2. 6 μM. Moreover, mice challenged with WNV that had been incubated with peptide 9 had reduced viremia and fatality compared with control animals. Peptide 9 penetrated the murine blood-brain barrier and was found in the brain parenchyma, implying that it may have antiviral activity in the central nervous system.

40|$|Abstract. In 2012, Texas {{experienced}} the largest outbreak of human <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>encephalitis</b> (WNE) since the intro-duction of West Nile virus (WNV) in 2002.

To determine whether the increase in WNV human cases could have been caused by viral genetic changes, the complete genomes of 17 isolates made from mosquito pools in Dallas and Montgomery Counties in 2012 were sequenced. The 2012 Texas isolates were found to be composed of two distinct clades, both circulating in Dallas and Montgomery Counties despite a 5 -fold higher disease incidence in the former. Although minor genetic differences existed between Dallas and Montgomery WNV populations, there was weak support for population subdivision or adaptive changes.
