5|$|Fremantle Prison's {{officers}} {{were known as}} warders until the early 20th century. They lived in specially built terrace houses within <b>walking</b> <b>distance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prison, and their lives were just as regimented as the prisoners. In the 1890s warders still had stringent living and working conditions, including ten- to twelve-hour working days. Due to a high turnover rate, many had little knowledge of either official policies or unofficial rules and traditions. The warder's role, previously unwritten, only became clearly defined in 1902. As well as guarding against escapes and enforcing discipline, they oversaw prisoner work and instructed inmates in trades. The warders were also supposed to be moral role models for prisoners, while maintaining a formal, distant, relationship.|$|E
