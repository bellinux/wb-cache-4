50|$|While some {{of these}} {{findings}} have been interpreted to indicate {{the presence of an}} ancient bear cult, certain analyses and discussions have led to contradicting results. According to Ina Wunn, based on the information archaeologists have about primitive man and bear cults, if Neanderthals did, in fact, worship bears, there should be evidence of it in their settlements and camps. Most bear remains have been found in caves, however, and not within early human settlements. This information has implied the non-existence of an ancient bear cult and has instigated the development of new theories. Many archaeologists, including Ina Wunn, {{have come to believe that}} since most bear species reside and hide their young in caves during the winter months for hibernation, it is possible that their remains were found in the caves because caves were their natural habitat. Bears lived inside these caves and perished for various reasons, whether it was illness or starvation. Wunn argues that the placement of these remains, whether it appears to be an identified pattern or not, is due to natural causes such as <b>wind,</b> <b>sediment,</b> or water. Therefore, in Wunn’s opinion, the assortment of bear remains in caves did not result from human activities and there is no evidence for a bear cult during the Middle Paleolithic era. Certain archaeologists, such as Emil Bächler, continue to use their excavations to support that an ancient bear cult did exist.|$|E

Thus, there is only little accumulation of dust in the Eifel region and Heinrich 4 is not recorded in the archive by our dust proxy. The second time slice (36 – 24 ka BP) has an increased content of dust accumulation and a high amount of east winds layers (up to 19 % of the dust storms per century came from the east).

For this reason, if numerous topographic data of beach is accurately collected, coastal erosion/acceleration is able to be assessed and clarified. Generally, however, many studies on coastal erosion have limitation to analyse the whole beach, carried out of partial area as like shoreline (horizontal 2 D) and beach profile (vertical 2 D) on account of limitation of numerical simulation. This is an important application for prevention of coastal erosion, and UAV photogrammetry {{is also used to}} 3 D topographic data. This paper analyses the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to 3 D map and beach volume change. UAV (Quadcopter) equipped with a non-metric camera was used to acquire images in Songjung beach which is located south-east Korea peninsula. The dynamics of beach topography, its geometric properties and estimates of eroded and deposited sand volumes were determined by combining elevation data with quarterly RTK-VRS measurements. To explore the new possibilities for assessment of coastal change we have developed a methodology for 3 D analysis of coastal topography evolution based on existing high resolution elevation data combined with low coast, UAV and on-ground RTK-VRS surveys. DSMs were obtained by stereo-matching using Agisoft Photoscan. Using GCPs the vertical accuracy of the DSMs was found to be 10 cm or better. The resulting datasets were integrated in a local coordinates and the method proved to be a very useful fool for the detection of areas where coastal erosion occurs and for the quantification of beach change. The value of such analysis is illustrated by applications to coastal of South Korea sites that face significant management challenges...|$|E
40|$|A three {{dimensional}} time-dependent baroclinic hydrodynamic model, including {{sediment transport}} and incorporating a turbulence energy sub-model, {{is used in}} cross sectional form to examine sediment movement at the shelf edge off North West Iberia at 42 ° 40. 5 ’N where measurements were made {{as part of the}} OMEX-II programme. These calculations are complemented by a simpler, in essence time-independent model, which is used to examine the sensitivity of the sediment distribution over the slope (from a shelf-break source) to changes in the specified values of horizontal and vertical diffusion coefficients. The philosophy of the paper is to use idealized tidal, wind and wind wave forcing to examine changes in sediment distribution resulting from these processes. Calculations with the time-dependent and steady state models give insight into both the role of events and long-term effects. The steady state model focuses on the off-shelf region, whilst the time-dependent model considers on-shelf events. Tidal calculations showed that for the stratification used here the internal tide in the OMEX region was primarily confined to the shelf edge and ocean. A mean on-shelf sediment transport in the surface layer and off-shelf transport at the bed was found. Across-shelf circulations produced by up-welling/down-welling favourable winds gave rise to on-shelf/off-shelf currents in the bottom boundary layer with an opposite flow in the surface layer. In the case of an up-welling favourable <b>wind,</b> <b>sediment</b> suspension was at a maximum in the near coastal region, with sediment being advected off shore in the surface layer. With a down-welling favourable wind, surface sediment was advected towards the shore, but there was offshore transport at the bed. Near the shelf edge any upwelling flow had the tendency to return this sediment to the surface layer from whence it was transported on-shore. So in essence the sediment was trapped within an on-shelf circulation cell. Wind waves effects increased the total bed stress and hence the sediment concentration and its transport, although its pattern was determined by tidal and wind forcing. The time independent model with increased/decreased lateral diffusivity gave an enhanced/reduced horizontal sediment distribution for a given settling velocity. As the settling velocity increases, the down-slope movement of sediment is increased, with a reduction in the thickness of the near-bed sediment layer, but with little change in its horizontal extent...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIntroduction: Observations of {{characteristics}} of sand seas on Saturn's moon, Titan, confirm similarities with Earth's deserts [1]. A careful study of details of these characteristics, such as sand sea areas, sand vol-umes, dune and inselberg morphologies, and sediment sources and transport {{will help to}} unveil the evolution-ary history of Titan's surface and climate. Nearly all dunes on Titan are linear in form [1, 2] and are concen-trated within the equatorial region [1, 2, 3, 4]. On Titan, dunes are similar in size, radar reflectivity, and mor-phology to those imaged in Earth's Namib, Saharan, and Saudi Arabian deserts [1, 2]. This similarity of morphology suggests that there must be, or have been, sufficient <b>wind,</b> <b>sediment</b> supply, and collection area for the dunes to form. Dunes and sand seas on Titan represent the results of major, global atmospheric and surface processes [1, 2, 3]. Understanding these regions is key to discover-ing the evolutionary history of the surface and atmos-phere of Titan, and to better understanding similar landforms and processes on Earth. This project is focused on inferring the mode and time frame of sand sea sediment accumulation by quantifying the area and estimating the volume of dune fields across Titan. This is the first detailed study of sand sea areas using images from Cassini's Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) in conjunction with Cassini SAR images. Unlike SAR images, ISS images have 100 % coverage of the sand sea latitudes but at lower resolution [5]. Precise calculations of the areas of sand seas, along with dune spacing and heights [6], will allow accurate estimates of total sand volume and will help to further refine the organic inventory from dunes [7, 4]. Presented here are the preliminary results from a detailed study of areas of all dunes on Titan from SAR/HiSAR, areas of Titan's Fensal and Aztlan sand seas using Cassini SAR and ISS and an estimate for the total organic inventory from dunes on Titan. Dune Areas from SAR/HiSAR: We identified where dunes are located within SAR and HiSAR im-ages to calculate the areal extent of all dune areas im-aged by Cassini SAR/HiSAR on Titan. Calculating the areas of sand seas is challenging, given the global cov-erage of moderate-resolution (350 m) SAR images of only ~ 40 %. With the added use of slightly poorer-resolution HiSAR images global coverage increases to ~ 50 %. Within SAR-imaged areas, dune sands and non-dune bedrock are clearly distinguished, so our estimate of areal coverage in SAR-imaged areas is probably good [3]. We classified dune material as being SAR dark and linear in morphology and excluded SAR-bright mountains and substrate and other non-dune, SAR-dark features, similar to [4] (Fig. 1 a).

40|$|In 2014 - 2015 {{the coastal}} stretch between Petten and Camperduin was {{strengthened}} by using 35 million m 3 of sand. At the seaward {{side of the}} Hondbossche & Pettermer sea defence a beach and dune system was built which is called the ‘Hondsbossche Dunes’. The old sea dike has disappeared behind the new dunes {{and is no longer}} an active part of the primary flood defence system. Since 2015 the Hondbossche Dunes (HD) protect the hinterland against flooding during storm erosion events and simultaneously it creates a large opportunity for the development of new nature and recreation areas. Along the Hondsbossche Dunes five different dune profile types have been constructed to stimulate morphological dynamics of the system. The Hondsbossche Dunes have the advantage of being a dynamic system which is highly adaptive to changes in climatic forcing. This climatic forcing redistribute the marine sand from the foreshore towards the dunes. To this day, the predicted influence of aeolian sediment transport on dune development for this system is only based on previous research and expertise. For this reason, the quantification and understanding how aeolian and marine sediments are transported towards the dunes is required in order to realize an effective approach for management and maintenance of the HD system regarding to the expected sea level rise and land subsidence. The main objective of this thesis is to explore the effect of aeolian sediment transport on the morphological development of the beach and dunes at the Hondsbossche Dunes, thereby concluding on the differences in response within the five different dune profile types. A conceptual framework of the parameters that characterize the system is introduced which distinguishes three components: (1) climatic forcing, (2) sediment supply and (3) dune types. Insight into these three components is obtained by a twofold approach: a data-analysis at the JARKUS transects for the first 19 months after construction and the application of the <b>wind</b> <b>sediment</b> transport model AeoLiS at a two-dimensional scale. The results obtained from the data-analysis show that an alongshore variations in beach and dune development is strongly present, for which the morphological changes were most pronounced in the seven months after construction. High beach volume losses were observed along the Hondsbossche Dunes. The volumetric losses were transported in alongshore direction leading to accretion of the beaches. Besides, volumetric losses were transported in cross-shore direction resulting in an average dune growth of 28 m 3 /m/y. The supply-limited model overestimates the measurements with a factor varying from 1. 2 to 3. The model shows to predict alongshore variations in dune growth as a result of spatial variations in sediment availability regarding to topography and grain size characteristics. It is seen that the five man-made profile types show an appreciable different response to the aeolian sediment transport towards the dunes. Dune growth of a profile type is likely to be determined by: (1) a temporal variability in local processes that determines the aeolian sediment supply towards the dunes and (2) the dune geometry that determines the capacity of the profile type to capture the sediments.

40|$|Santiago is the 7 th largest {{major city}} of Latin America with almost 8 million {{inhabitants}} and {{is situated in}} a fairly closed watershed, surrounded {{on the eastern side}} by the high Andean mountain chain with altitudes of 5, 000 m. From the Andean mountains, the Mapocho River and a set of large and small streams transport -often torrentially- water and sediment. In thirty years, Santiago has increased its size two fold, replacing previous agricultural lands, native forests and shrubs with urban land uses, and occupying rivers beds and streams. These land use and cover changes have had dramatic environmental consequences. The mentioned urban dynamic has produced a city in constant collision with the natural system. This structural disarticulation produces many environmental problems such as an increase in city’s surface and air temperatures, an accelerated disappearance of vegetation, a major interruption in <b>wind,</b> <b>sediment</b> and water flows, and finally, increasing people’s exposure to environmental hazards. Since streams, canals and rivers are structural components of Santiago’s landscape, they can function as key links between the urban-social and natural system and provide multiple ecosystem services, helping to reduce environmental problems and ensure long-term urban sustainability. Traditionally, the analysis of river and streamsides has been focused on rural and natural landscapes as well as on environmental protection and nature conservation. Nowadays, there is an increasing interest and necessity to understand the environmental status, functions and possibilities of riparian zones in urban environments in order to delineate and plan greenways, which provide social and ecological benefits. Green infrastructure such as urban greenways is a key component of sustainable cities. Few studies have been conducted to evaluate the socio-ecological status of urban riparian zones and even fewer to assess these areas in terms of their potential as multifunctional greenways. New efforts should be conducted to develop analytical application-oriented frameworks in the green infrastructure field. This research elaborates and proposes a transferable conceptual-methodological framework for evaluating the potential for multifunctional riparian greenway development. An analytical application-oriented framework to assess the potential for multifunctional green infrastructure development is proposed by articulating and improving three analyses hitherto used separately: multicriteria, least cost path and opportunities-challenges. The Mapocho River was selected for the application and testing of the proposed conceptual-methodological framework to contribute to multifunctional green infrastructure planning in Santiago as a city representative of the structure and processes of megacities in Latin America. First, the main ecological and social characteristics of the Mapocho’s riparian zone are analyzed, making a synthesis of the socio-ecological status. Second, the suitability to provide multiple ecosystem services of the riparian zone is spatially explicitly modelled, first separately, as mono-functional suitability, and then, integrated into a multifunctional suitability evaluation. Third, the opportunities and challenges perceived by government actors are identified and analyzed as well as those derived from an institutional and regulatory analysis. Finally, the assessment phase concludes with a discussion on the main potential {{for the development of a}} greenway, resulting from the synthesis and integration of the most relevant findings of the suitability and opportunities analysis The socio-ecological status of the riparian zones is characterized by being highly altered in ecological terms, diverse in social terms, and highly used by the metropolitan transport infrastructure with a concentration of green areas in a few municipalities. This means that the riparian zone provides limited physical support for important social and ecological functions characteristic of these zones in urban environments: habitat, aesthetic, cooling, transport route and flood mitigation. The results reveal a significant east-west gradient in the socio-ecological status of riparian zone, which gradually decreases from east to west. The riparian zone of the Mapocho River in Santiago has good suitability as a wind corridor, providing a cooling effect and to mitigate flood hazards. The main challenges for the development of a multifunctional urban greenway in the Mapocho River corresponds to low levels of inter-jurisdictional and inter-sectoral coordination and cooperation, maintenance costs and the existence of urban highways in the zone. On the contrary, the main opportunities are the existence of important sectors of vacant land, increased political and social importance of urban green areas and the existence of a set of consolidated riparian parks. In synthesis, the assessment developed in the Mapocho River identifies the most important aspects to be considered and the greatest potentialities to capitalize in planning a multifunctional greenway along the Mapocho River. This is key when thinking about a possible master plan for the Mapocho River that returns the river to the city and values it as an axis for urban integration. The development of a multifunctional greenway in Santiago can considerably contribute to the social and ecological connectivity and thereby mitigate the socio-ecological segregation and disconnection characteristic of cities in the region. It may also contribute significantly to reconcile urban growth with ecological health and people’s quality of life, maintaining functions and key ecosystem services and mitigating the negative effects of urbanization...|$|E

The estimated surface area affected by human-induced soil degradation is 24 per {{cent of the}} inhabited land areas (Oldeman, 1994; Oldeman et al., 1991). Of various degradation processes soil erosion by action of wind {{plays an important role}} in semi arid and arid environment. The causative factors are the dryness of the environment, soil properties and vegetation cover. <b>Wind</b> erodes finer <b>sediments</b> by a process called deflation. The sediments are transported by saltation and/or suspension. The <b>wind</b> transported <b>sediments</b> can also wear away rocks. This process is called abrasion. When there is selective removal of finer <b>sediments</b> by <b>wind,</b> there remains surface coarser sediments which are called desert pavements. The principal depositional landform of wind action is dune formation. Depending on <b>sediments</b> supply, <b>wind</b> characteristics and vegetation cover several types of dune formation are possible. For monitoring and assessing wind erosion the GLASOD approach would be very much useful. For assessing erosion features air photo interpretation technique helps in delineating accurately the type, extent and severity of wind erosion patterns. In case of unavailability of recent air photos, a rapidly deployable and effective low cost method can be applied to detect and asses...|$|R
40|$|The Sahelian zone of Africa is {{the region}} that is {{globally}} most subjected to land degradation, with wind erosion being the most important soil degradation process. By using control measures, {{the negative effects of}} wind erosion can be reduced. At present, adoption of wind erosion control measures by Sahelian farmers is low, as most recommended measures do not fit into the farming systems. Therefore, the possibilities of using the local agro-forestry system, i. e. scattered vegetation of trees and shrubs as a wind erosion control strategy were explored in this study. The study area was located in the Sahelian zone of Burkina Faso. A survey among farmers revealed that they generally have a good knowledge of wind erosion processes and the possible wind erosion protection by natural vegetation. Detailed field measurements of <b>wind</b> speed and <b>sediment</b> transport revealed that the fluctuations in horizontal wind speed mainly cause wind erosion. Measurements around isolated vegetation elements revealed that these elements reduce <b>wind</b> speeds and <b>sediment</b> transport, and they are effective in trapping material already in transport. The effectiveness in reducing <b>wind</b> speed and <b>sediment</b> transport of scattered vegetation depends on the number of vegetation elements, the type of vegetation element and the height, width and porosity of the canopy of the element. A model was developed to simulate field-scale wind erosion with different types and arrangements of vegetation elements. This model can be used to develop optimal vegetation cover densities and spatial arrangements for wind erosion control. Overall it can be concluded that the use of the local agro-forestry system as a wind erosion control strategy is promising...|$|R

The present study measures the volumes of <b>sediments</b> mobilized by <b>winds</b> in the dune zone and roughly models the mean annual volumes of <b>wind</b> mobilized <b>sediments,</b> per surface unit as well as along the length beach unit for the coastal strip between Sulina and Sf.

50|$|About 300 {{million years}} ago, {{the land was}} uplifted {{creating}} the ancestral Rocky Mountains. Fountain Formation was deposited during the Pennsylvanian period of the Paleozoic era, 290-296 million years ago. Over the next 150 million years, the mountains uplifted, continued to erode, and covered themselves in their own <b>sediment.</b> <b>Wind,</b> gravity, rainwater, snow, and glacial ice eroded the granite mountains over geologic time scales. The Ancestral Rockies were eventually buried under subsequent strata.|$|R

25|$|Across Israel {{there is}} a wide range of microclimates due to differing soil types and topography. Most areas have {{limestone}} based soils with layers of marl and hard dolomites. The color of the soils range from red terra rosa in Judea and Galilee near Mount Tabor to gray in the mountain ranges stretching from Mount Carmel to Zikhron Ya'akov. Marine sediments are found in the loam soils of the coastal plains and {{at the base of the}} elevated foothills around Binyamina-Giv'at Ada and Latroun. The Golan Heights and parts of the Upper and Lower Galilee regions have significant layers of basalt deposits of clay and tuff created by centuries of volcanic activity and lava flows. <b>Wind</b> blown <b>sediment</b> deposits help create the loess based and alluvial sand soils of the Negev area.|$|R
50|$|A clastic dike is a seam of {{sedimentary}} material that fills an open fracture in and cuts across sedimentary rock strata or layering in other rock types. Clastic dikes form rapidly by fluidized injection (mobilization of pressurized pore fluids) or passively by water, <b>wind,</b> and gravity (<b>sediment</b> swept into open cracks). Diagenesis {{may play a}} role in the formation of some dikes. Clastic dikes are commonly vertical or near-vertical. Centimeter-scale widths are common, but thicknesses range from millimetres to metres. Length is usually many times width.|$|R
40|$|Many dune fields {{exhibit a}} {{downwind}} transition from forward-pointing barchan dunes to stabilized, backward-pointing parabolic dunes, {{accompanied by an}} increase in vegetation. A recent model predicts this pattern transition occurs when dune surface erosion/deposition rates decrease below a threshold of half the vegetation growth rate. We provide a direct test using a unique data set of repeat topographic surveys across White Sands Dune Field and find strong quantitative support for the model threshold. We also show the threshold hypothesis applied to a barchan dune results naturally in its curvature inversion, as the point of threshold crossing progresses from the horns to the crest. This simple, general threshold framework can be an extremely useful tool for predicting the response of dune landscapes to changes in <b>wind</b> speed, <b>sediment</b> supply, or vegetation growth rate. Near the threshold, a small environmental change could result in a drastic change in dune pattern and activity...|$|R
