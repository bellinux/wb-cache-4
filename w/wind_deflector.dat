2500|$|In 2006, Caterham {{introduced}} the CSR Superlight. Based on the CSR260, this model adds a ‘Superlight’ lightweight specification to the CSR, further extending the CSR260’s already epic performance envelope. The 2.3 litre Cosworth-powered Caterham CSR260 Superlight brings all the performance credentials associated with its stablemate; performance {{is quoted as}} a 0-60mph time of 3.1 seconds and {{a top speed of}} [...] The Superlight swaps the windscreen, carpet, heater and weather gear on the standard car for a limited slip differential and a quicker steering rack. There is a 25 kilo weight reduction over the standard CSR260, this model variant also adds distinctive Superlight styling to the exterior, including a <b>wind</b> <b>deflector,</b> a carbon fibre dashboard and wings, a black powder coated cockpit and a quick-release MOMO steering wheel. Of particular note are ‘Dynamic Suspensions’ Damper units developed by specialist Multimatic for the car. The damper units lend the already capable CSR a further edge in terms of handling and cornering performance. It features the same 2.3 litre (260bhp) engine as the CSR260, but weighs only [...] and has a power-to-weight ratio of -per-tonne.|$|E

5000|$|A new , [...] {{engine was}} {{introduced}} on the 1.7 Quadrifoglio Verde, which replaced the 1.5 QV. The 1.7 engine was {{developed from the}} 1.5 by enlarging bore and stroke; it also used new cylinder heads, incorporating hydraulic tappets. To cope with the increased power the new QV was equipped with vented front brake discs.The 1.7 QV looked close to its predecessor, but had lost the grey mid-body stripe and gained new alloy wheels, front side window <b>wind</b> <b>deflectors,</b> more pronounced side skirts and a rear body-colour spoiler on the boot lid. Inside it featured a leather-covered steering wheel, red carpets, and leatherette-backed sport seats upholstered in a grey/black/red chequered cloth.|$|R
5000|$|Drivers {{can also}} {{increase}} fuel efficiency by minimizing transported mass, i.e. {{the number of}} people or the amount of cargo, tools, and equipment carried in the vehicle. Removing common unnecessary accessories such as roof racks, brush guards, <b>wind</b> <b>deflectors</b> (or [...] "spoilers", when designed for downforce and not enhanced flow separation), running boards, push bars, and narrow and lower profile tires will improve fuel efficiency by reducing both weight and aerodynamic drag. Some cars also use a half size spare tire, for weight/cost/space saving purposes. On a typical vehicle, every extra 100 pounds increases fuel consumption by 2%. [...] Removing roof racks (and accessories) can decrease fuel consumption by 20%.|$|R
2500|$|A crow's nest was {{affixed to}} the mainmast. A {{standard}} Royal Navy [...] whaler was fitted {{on the port side}} of the funnel in addition to the US-issue ship's boat on the starboard side; additional lifesaving rafts were also fitted: big ones on sloping launch skids aft of the funnel and small ones aft of the searchlights. <b>Wind</b> <b>deflectors</b> were fitted on {{the leading edge of the}} bridge area and a canvas-covered shelter was installed on the quarterdeck to provide better weather protection for depth charge crews. Oiling fairleads were fitted to the edge of the hull by the anchor winch. The bilge keels were lengthened and made deeper (a process that took a minimum of three weeks).|$|R
5000|$|Top-mount sliding sunroofs (rail mount topslider) {{have been}} a popular factory option in Europe for many years. A large glass panel slides open in tracks {{on top of the}} roof, with no loss of headroom. Most feature an {{integral}} <b>wind</b> <b>deflector</b> to eliminate wind noise. Examples include Donmar's original Skyroof topslider (aftermarket system), the London Taxi and Renault 5 cars.|$|E
50|$|LSOs {{do their}} waving from the LSO Platform, {{which is on}} the port side of the ship aft of the port side {{aircraft}} elevator. It is protected by a <b>wind</b> <b>deflector,</b> and has an escape area into which deck personnel can jump in an emergency. The platform is outfitted with communications gear, deck status and ship indications, as well as controls for the OLS.|$|E
50|$|A windblocker or <b>wind</b> <b>deflector</b> {{minimizes}} {{noise and}} rushing air reaching the occupants. Mazda pioneered a version on the RX7 convertible which featured an integral rigid opaque panel that folded {{up from behind}} the front seats. Current convertibles feature windblockers of various designs including detachable fold-up designs (e.g., Toyota Solara), vertically retractable glass (e.g., Audi TT), minimal flaps (e.g., Mazda Miata) - or other integrated wind controlling systems.|$|E
50|$|Starting in 1980, Mercedes {{offered the}} NG trucks {{with a new}} range of engines from 95 kW/130 hp to 276 kW/375 hp. This {{generation}} can be recognized by <b>wind</b> <b>deflectors</b> fitted to the lower front corners of the cabs. In addition, the horizontal chrome bar on the grill was dropped. Model badges and mirror casings were now black. The chassis on semi-trailer tractors was redesigned, lowering it by 120 mm. A fourth cab variant above the L-Fahrerhaus, the GR-Fahrerhaus now was a true long-distance cabin with a raised roof and wardrobe locker. This cab was also wider than the others, noticeable by the flush wheel arches, and {{no longer had a}} rear left side window nor rear windows.|$|R
40|$|Various {{aerodynamic}} design {{elements and}} technics (<b>wind</b> <b>deflectors,</b> <b>wind</b> walls, etc.) are utilized {{for improvement of}} the thermal efficiency of the natural draft cooling towers, particularly in conditions of cross wind. One of the technical methods, proposed by engineers of Belarus Academy of Sciences, is installation of the ventilation window {{in the center of}} the fill. This method is substantiated by the fact that the flow of cooling gas obtains maximum temperature and humidity near the center of the under-fill space of cooling tower and, as a consequence, performs minimal heat exchange. The influence of the fill ventilation window and <b>wind</b> <b>deflectors</b> in the inlet windows of the cooling tower on its thermal performance in condition of cross-wind is investigated in the paper numerically. The cooling tower of the “Woo-Jin” power plant (China) 150 m of the height and 114 m of the base diameter was taken as a prototype. The analogy (equivalence) between the heat and mass transfer was taken into consideration, which enabled us to consider single-phase flow and perform complicated 3 D simulation by using modern personal computers. Heat transfer coefficient for the fill and its hydrodynamic resistance were defined by using actual data on total flow rate in the cooling tower. The numerical model and computational methods were tested and verified in numerous previous works. The non-linear dependence of the thermal performance of the cooling tower on wind velocity (with the minimum in vicinity of  Ucr  ~ 8 m/s for the simulated system) was demonstrated. Calculations show that in the condition of the average wind speed the fill ventilation window doesn’t improve, but slightly decrease (by 3 – 7 %) performance of the cooling tower. Situation changes in the condition of strong winds  Ucw  > 12 m/s, which are not typical for Belarus. Utilization of airflow deflectors at the inlet windows of cooling tower, conversely, increases thermal performance of the cooling tower on 10 – 12 % for the wide range of winds exceeding 2 m/s. Results of the investigation may be helpful for optimal design of natural draft and perspective “hybrid” cooling towers. </p...|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} bridge ramp begins {{behind its}} junction with the Stralsund ring road (the B 96 federal road) and consists, of an 85.53-metre-long embankment structure, measured to the abutment {{of the first}} approach bridge. Beyond it are the two Stralsund approach bridges (Vorlandbrücken Stralsund) with gradients of up to 4%. The first, structure BW 1.1, is 327.5-metre-long bridge made of pre-stressed concrete with ten sections and a twin prestressed beam slab girder as the superstructure. BW 1.2 is a 317.0-metre-long bridge with six sections and a single-cell steel composite superstructure that was manufactureed by the steelworks in Neumarkt-Sengenthal. An architectural feature is the B 96 approach road section with its two pairs of Y-supports, which enable the large column spacing of 72 metres at constant height. The railings of the approach bridges have 0.70-metre-high inside walls with laminated safety glass panels as <b>wind</b> <b>deflectors</b> and spray shields. The structures are founded on driven concrete piles cast in-situ.|$|R
50|$|After {{the main}} bridge comes the Dänholm {{approach}} bridge (Vorlandbrücke Dänholm, BW 3), a 532.3-metre-long approach bridge structure, and the Strelasund approach bridge (Vorlandbrücke Strelasund, BW 4), with {{a length of}} 532.2 metres. Both structures have a 10-section, single-cell pre-stressed box girder superstructure and are anchored on bored pilings made of cast-in-place concrete. The railings of the Dänholm bridge are designed with a 0.70 metre high internal lining of laminated safety glass as a <b>wind</b> <b>deflector.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1989 a new SL {{generation}} superseded {{the previous}} {{models of the}} R 107 series. It offered a combination of dynamic sportiness, even greater comfort and particularly harmonious design. At its unveiling at the 1989 Geneva Motor Show, the SL from the new R 129 series immediately {{became one of the}} main attractions. The new model generation featured a number of world premieres: motor sport-inspired seats with integrated safety belts, a fully automatic folding soft top and <b>wind</b> <b>deflector</b> for draught-free convertible driving.|$|E
50|$|The {{production}} Katana of 1981 differed {{only slightly}} from the prototype; changes included a small <b>wind</b> <b>deflector</b> screen, paired mufflers, and black accent paint on the front fender and air box covers. Target's design philosophy - keeping components compact and close-fitting - was applied to {{all areas of the}} bike's design to reduce production costs, weight, and number of components required. Examples include the overlapping dials on the instrument cluster, and the offset petrol filler which allowed for a clean continuous seam weld on the tank.|$|E
5000|$|In 1959 Fiat re-introduced an {{upmarket}} 1100 model, positioned {{between the}} standard saloon and the 1200 Granluce: the 1100 Lusso (type 103 H), {{also known as}} De luxe or Luxus on foreign markets.Based on the 1100 model 1958 bodyshell, the Lusso was distinguished by elaborate exterior trim. At the front {{for the first time}} on a 1100 the Fiat badge was moved from the bonnet to the centre of the grille, featuring a new square mesh radiator. The body-side chrome spear split in two to encompass a contrasting colour band (matching the roof paint) extended from the front doors to the end of the rear quarter panels, where there was a brass-plated ornament. The fuel filler cap was hidden under a lockable flap. There were new hubcaps, and the bumpers carried tall rubber-edged overriders. New interior features were a padded vinyl shelf added below the dashboard, and <b>wind</b> <b>deflectors</b> fixed to the front side windows.Thanks to a twin-choke carburettor and a higher 7.85:1 compression ratio the Lusso's 1.1-litre engine developed [...] (55 PS SAE), rather than the 43 PS CUNA of the model 1958 1100. Top speed was 130 km/h.Another change from the regular saloons was the two-piece propshaft, inherited from the TV saloons.|$|R
5000|$|In 1983, Fiat {{completed}} the range with the Ritmo ES ("energy saving") models {{and the hot}} hatch, Ritmo Abarth 130 TC. The latter {{was based on the}} 125 TC but was powered by a 1,995 cc engine with power output increased to [...] This was achieved by replacing the single Weber carb used in the 125 TC with twin Solex/Weber carburettors on a side-draught manifold, and via improved cam profiles. The 130 TC had a top speed of 195 km/h and accelerated from 0 to100 km/h in 7.8 seconds. It was fitted with Recaro bucket seats in Britain (optional in Europe) and it remained the only 1980s European hot hatch to continue utilise carburettors instead of fuel injection. Ignition timing was controlled electronically. Although appearing outwardly similar to the restyled 105 TC with its lower door and wheelarch trims, the 130 TC could be distinguished by its polished four-spoke alloy wheels (continued from the earlier 125 TC), aerodynamic perspex front door <b>wind</b> <b>deflectors,</b> and lower hatchback spoiler. The powerful twin-cam was mated to a close ratio five-speed ZF manual gearbox and had superior performance to its contemporary rivals, which included the Volkswagen Golf GTI, Ford Escort XR3i, Vauxhall Astra GTE and the MG Maestro.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCONVENIENT is {{a project}} where {{prediction}} and integrated control are applied on several subsystems with electrified actuators. The technologies developed in this project are applied to a long-haul tractor and semi-trailer combination. A Volvo truck meeting the Eu 6 emission standard is rebuilt {{with a number of}} controllable electrified actuators. An e-Horizon system collects information about future road topography and speed limits. Controllable aerodynamic <b>wind</b> <b>deflectors</b> reduce the <b>wind</b> drag. The tractor is also equipped with a full digital cluster for human machine interface development. A primary project goal is to develop a model-based optimal controller that uses predictive information from the e-Horizon system in order to minimize fuel consumption. Several energy buffers are controlled in an integrated and optimal way using model predictive control. Several buffers are considered, such as the cooling system, the battery, and the vehicle kinetic energy. This paper presents details on the model predictive controller of the battery system and of the cooling system. Another project goal is to reduce fuel consumption by using adaptive aerodynamics. Controllers are developed that automatically sets an optimal roof deflector angle and the optimal side deflector angle. The results presented in this paper are encouraging. A third focus is the human machine interface and especially the communication between the driver and the control system during driving. This project develops a driver interface that encourages the driver to use the adaptive cruise controller when appropriate. The CONVENIENT project will be finalized this year. This paper presents the main project findings...|$|R

50|$|The NiD 590's two pilots sat {{side-by-side}} at {{the front}} of the cabin. Their cockpit was semi-enclosed with glazing ahead and above but with open sides fitted with <b>wind</b> <b>deflectors.</b> They had dual controls and seat-type parachutes. This part of the cabin, under the wing, was conventional, with box-frame sides and bulkheads; just behind the seats there was an access passage with a side door from which both the controls and the rear cabin could be reached. Aft of this the final conventional bulkhead leaned backwards towards the tail, forming the start of the NiD 590's most unusual feature: the rest of the cabin was under an arched roof, extending from the forward cabin structure but the sides were only about 1 m high, with no glazing. Careful fuselage design deflected the slipstream beyond the rear of the cabin and provided its various occupants with a calm working environment and an excellent all-round and downwards view of the French colonies below. Their rear view was greatly enhanced by the very unusual rear fuselage: beyond the trailing edge the aft end of the cabin tapered rapidly in plan onto the vertical part of a T-shaped bulkhead supporting the arched upper structure. Behind it, the fuselage maintained this upper structure on two longerons, with very narrow, concave sides down to a third, lower, longeron. This narrow rear fuselage provided a wide rearward and downward view even from the back of the cabin where the rear gunner sat with a twin Lewis gun on a flexible mount.|$|R
