25|$|Next {{come the}} gods of the heaven. Eos, goddess of the dawn, rides sidesaddle into battle. She pulls back her horse and is armed with a torch which she thrusts forward. She is {{followed}} by Helios, who rises up from the ocean with his quadriga and enters the battle armed with a torch. His target is a Giant standing in his <b>way.</b> <b>He</b> <b>has</b> rolled over another Giant. Theia follows, amidst her children. She {{is the mother of}} the day and night stars. Next to her mother and with her back to the viewer, the moon goddess Selene rides on her mule over a Giant.|$|E
25|$|The Nizaris regard Hassan bin (son of) Ali as a Trustee Imam (imam al-mustawda) {{as opposed}} to a Hereditary Imam (imam al-mustaqarr). This fact is clearly {{demonstrated}} in the recitation of the Nizari Ismailis’ daily prayers three times a day in which although Hassan bin Ali is revered as part of the Prophet's personal family (Ahl al-Bayt), his name is not included in the hereditary lineage from their first Imam, Imam Ali, to their 49th Imam Prince Karim al Hussaini. If Hassan bin Ali's name were to be included as one of the Ismaili Imams in their prayer recitation then the present Imam Prince Karim of the Nizari Ismailis would have to be the 50th Imam and not the 49th Imam - the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> identified himself and is known to the world.|$|E

25|$|Allan Quatermain, an adventurer {{and white}} hunter based in Durban, {{in what is}} now South Africa, is {{approached}} by aristocrat Sir Henry Curtis and his friend Captain Good, seeking his help finding Sir Henry's brother, who was last seen travelling north into the unexplored interior on a quest for the fabled King Solomon's Mines. Quatermain has a mysterious map purporting to lead to the mines, but had never taken it seriously. However, he agrees to lead an expedition in return for a share of the treasure, or a stipend for his son if he is killed along the <b>way.</b> <b>He</b> <b>has</b> little hope they will return alive, but reasons that he has already outlived most people in his profession, so dying in this manner at least ensures that his son will be provided for. They also take along a mysterious native, Umbopa, who seems more regal, handsome and well-spoken than most porters of his class, but who is very anxious to join the party.|$|E
25|$|Now, praise be to God that Dr. Zamenhof has {{invented the}} Esperanto language. It {{has all the}} {{potential}} qualities of becoming the international means of communication. All of us must be grateful and thankful to him for this noble effort; for in this <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> served his fellowmen well. With untiring effort and self-sacrifice {{on the part of}} its devotees Esperanto will become universal. Therefore every one of us must study this language and spread it as far as possible so that day by day it may receive a broader recognition, be accepted by all nations and governments of the world, and {{become a part of the}} curriculum in all the public schools. I hope that Esperanto will be adopted as the language of all the future international conferences and congresses, so that all people need acquire only two languages—one their own tongue and the other the international language. Then perfect union will be established between all the people of the world. Consider how difficult it is today to communicate with various nations. If one studies fifty languages one may yet travel through a country and not know the language. Therefore I hope that you will make the utmost effort, so that this language of Esperanto may be widely spread.|$|E
500|$|Suresh Krishnamoorthy of [...] The Hindu summarised, [...] "Magadheera {{is not for}} the weak-hearted, {{those who}} do not like the sight of blood and neither is it for those who like movies with storylines that are much-closer-to-everyday- reality. But Rajamouli excels in story-telling. The <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> used the {{flashback}} as a flip switch, going back and forth and taking the viewer through a 400-year journey in a jiffy is interesting. The rest is about how well technology, creativity, imagination and innovation are leveraged to present what is an eye-pleasing experience for viewers." [...] B. V. S. Prakash of The Times of India wrote, [...] "Despite a few narrative lapses, the much-hyped semi-periodic epic lives up to expectations. Unlike his previous action-centric films, director Rajamouli dishes a heart-touching love story in a lavish canvas convincingly. Also kudos for the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> visualised and presented the film." [...] He added, [...] "After not-so-impressive Chirutha, Ram Charan Tej returns as a valiant soldier and breathes life into the larger-than-life role with ease. Similarly, Kajal known for simple lover girl roles transforms into a determined princess and truly impresses. Dev Gil is adequate as the ruthless villain", and rated the film 3 out of 5.|$|E

500|$|Connor's {{appearance}} {{as a regular}} in After the Fall, was initially met with dismay by some fans. IDW representative Chris Ryall responded to these complaints with optimism, assuring the fans that the character would win them over, just the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been, {{by the time the}} series end. True to his words, After The Fall’s Connor was received positively. Brian Lynch confirmed this in an interview, stating that Connor has not only been the most pleasantly surprising character for him to write, he has been the most surprising for the fans as well, [...] "Connor was a great character on the TV show but, I don’t think he was ever a favorite. But he’s slowly but surely {{become one of the most}} popular characters in After The Fall, which is wonderful." [...] He further said that he himself like the character so much now, he wants to do a book called 'Son of Angel' based on him.|$|E
500|$|The rest of {{the story}} is spent {{investigating}} the events leading to Jake's shooting, learning the identity of the shapeshifter who saved him, as well the person who ordered his assassination, a mysterious crime lord named [...] "Drake". Most of the information is found by piecing together snippets of data found by hacking various protected computer systems. Along the <b>way,</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> encounters with gangs, criminals, and magically awakened creatures while under constant threat of attack from contract killers. Jake also discovers and develops his own latent magical abilities. Apart from his totem spirit, his only allies are the hired services of shadowrunners. It is eventually revealed that Jake is a data courier who was carrying a program in a computer built inside his brain. The program was designed to destroy a malevolent artificial intelligence, which the Aneki Corporation is trying to protect. The company is being aided by Drake, who {{turns out to be a}} dragon and the mastermind behind the plot.|$|E
500|$|Wenger {{clarified}} Vieira's future {{after the}} match: [...] "My intention is clear: {{to keep him}} [...] The challenge {{in front of us}} is hugely difficult and we need a complete focus. I'm not resigned to let the story go on. It has all to be sorted out before the season." [...] He added that if Vieira chose to leave, the club could sufficiently replace him: [...] "We've worked very hard {{in the last five years}} to get good young players in and you saw that today." [...] Reyes, who was named man of the match, was frustrated at his missed chance early in the second half, but continued: [...] "I set one up and then scored myself so I was much happier." [...] Bergkamp was impressed with Fàbregas's performance in the match: [...] "Normally at 17, you might be a bit unsure when you step out. But with players like Cesc, the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> developed in one year is quite amazing." ...|$|E

500|$|The animators and {{character}} designers {{had a lot}} of discussion about what Frank Grimes should look like. He was originally designed as a [...] "burly ex-marine guy with a crew cut", but would later be modeled after Michael Douglas in the movie Falling Down and director Jim Reardon's college roommate. Hank Azaria provided the voice of Frank Grimes, even though such a role would normally have been performed by a guest star. The producers decided Azaria was more suitable because the role involved a great deal of frustration and required extensive knowledge of the show. Azaria felt that the role should instead go to William H. Macy. According to Azaria, [...] "I based the character on William Macy. I can't really copy him vocally, but I tried to get as close as I could and copy his rhythms and the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> that sort of seething passion underneath that total calm exterior." [...] The producers worked a lot with Azaria to help him perfect the role, and gave him more guidance than they normally would. Azaria felt that it was the role he worked hardest on, adding [...] "I think it's the one we did the most takes on, the most emotional, it felt like the one I worked on the hardest from a performance point of view, in preparation and in execution." ...|$|E
500|$|Troilus, {{in one of}} his ancient manifestations as a boy-soldier overwhelmed, reappears both {{in works}} Boitani {{discusses}} and those he does not. Christa Wolf in her Kassandra features a seventeen-year-old Troilus, first to die of all the sons of Priam. The novel's treatment of the character's death has features of both medieval and ancient versions. Troilus has just gained his first love, once more called Briseis. It is only after his death that she is to betray him. On {{the first day of the}} war, Achilles seeks Troilus out and forces him into battle with the help of the Myrmidons. Troilus tries to fight in the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been taught princes should do, but Achilles strikes the boy down and leaps on top of him, before attempting to throttle him. Troilus escapes and runs to the sanctuary of the temple of Apollo where he is helped to take his armour off. Then, in [...] "some of the most powerful and hair-raising" [...] words ever written on Troilus' death, Wolf describes how Achilles enters the temple, caresses then half-throttles the terrified boy, who lies on the altar, before finally beheading him like a sacrificial victim. After his death, the Trojan council propose that Troilus be officially declared to have been twenty in the hope of avoiding the prophecy about him but Priam, in his grief, refuses as this would insult his dead son further. In [...] "exploring the violent underside of sexuality and the sexual underside of violence", Wolf revives a theme suggested by the ancient vases where an [...] "erotic aura seems to pervade representations of a fully armed Achilles pursuing or butchering a naked, boyish Troilus".|$|E
500|$|In Philosopher's Stone, Harry re-enters the wizarding {{world at}} age 11 and enrolls in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He makes friends with fellow {{students}} Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, and is mentored by the school's headmaster, Albus Dumbledore. He also meets Professor Severus Snape, who intensely dislikes and bullies him. Harry fights Voldemort several times while at school, as the wizard tries to regain a physical form. In Goblet of Fire, Harry is mysteriously entered {{in a dangerous}} magical competition called the Triwizard Tournament, which he discovers is a trap designed to allow the return of Lord Voldemort to full strength. During Order of the Phoenix, Harry {{and several of his}} friends face off against Voldemort's Death Eaters, a group of Dark witches and wizards, and narrowly defeat them. In Half-Blood Prince, Harry learns that Voldemort has divided his soul into several parts, creating [...] "horcruxes" [...] from various unknown objects to contain them; in this <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> ensured his immortality as long as {{at least one of the}} horcruxes still exists. Two of these had already been destroyed, one a diary destroyed by Harry in the events of Chamber of Secrets and one a ring destroyed by Dumbledore shortly before the events of Half-Blood Prince. Dumbledore takes Harry along in the attempt to destroy a third horcrux contained in a locket. However, the horcrux had been taken by an unknown wizard, and upon their return Dumbledore is ambushed and disarmed by Draco Malfoy who cannot bring himself to kill him. Dumbledore is subsequently killed by Snape, who finishes what Malfoy started.|$|E

In recognition of this performance, Coppell won the Manager of the Year award for the second season in succession. Speaking earlier in the season, Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said of Coppell: [...] "I think it's totally deserved. It's a marvellous contribution he's made.

2500|$|According to Miller, democracy, to Diệm, {{was rooted}} in his dual {{identity}} as Confucian and Catholic, and was associated with communitarianism and the doctrine of Personalism. He defined democracy as [...] "a social ethos based on certain sense of moral duty", not in the US sense of [...] "political right" [...] or political pluralism and {{in the context of}} an Asian country like Vietnam, Confucian values were relevant to deal with contemporary problems in politics, governance, and social change. In this sense, Diệm was not a reactionary mandarin and lacking in interest in democracy like the <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been portrayed by some scholars. His way of thinking about democracy became key factor of his approach to political and administrative reform.
