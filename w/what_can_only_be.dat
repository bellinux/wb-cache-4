Fränger distinguished these {{pieces from the}} artist's other works and argued that despite their anti-cleric polemic, they were nevertheless all altarpieces, probably commissioned for the devotional purposes of a mystery cult. While commentators accept Fränger's analysis as astute and broad in scope, they have often questioned his final conclusions. These are regarded by many scholars as hypothesis only, and built on an unstable foundation and <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> conjecture. Critics argue that artists during this period painted not for their own pleasure but for commission, while the language and secularization of a post-Renaissance mind-set projected onto Bosch would have been alien to the late-Medieval painter.|$|E

500|$|Dalrymple {{analyses}} {{the media}} attention and reaction to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, and how certain media interpreted a perceived lack of emotion {{on the part of}} the girl’s parents as evidence of guilt. Dalrymple writes that the [...] "demand that emotion should be shown in public, or be assumed not to exist and therefore indicate a guilty mind, is now not an uncommon one", and cites two similar cases involving Joanne Lees and Lindy Chamberlain. Dalrymple then analyses the outcry from the public and the media to the lack of emotion shown by the Queen after the death of Princess Diana, and contends that [...] "the tabloid newspapers carried out <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> called a campaign of bullying against the sovereign" [...] and that those gathered outside Buckingham Palace were [...] "bullying rather than expressing any genuine grief". He concludes by asserting that the sentimentality shown by both the media and the public “was inherently dishonest in a way that parallels the dishonesty that lies behind much sentimentality itself".|$|E

He concluded that, even as a fan of old school and abstract gameplay design, he had not enjoyed his time with the game. Lark Anderson, writing for GameSpot said there was [...] "never a dull moment" [...] due to the eccentric cast and story, and found the puzzle elements to be an entertaining challenge. His main complaints were the poor graphics, unresponsive camera system, lack of direction during navigation and the constant need for backtracking. Nintendo World Report's Nick DiMola noted the dialogue for its humor, but generally faulted most other aspects of the game; he called its graphics and sound low-quality, felt the gameplay was shallow, and found the puzzle solving segments a chore. He found it hard to recommend the title for any but dedicated fans of Suda's work. PALGN reviewer Ben Chev called the script [...] "well-written in <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> described as a typical Suda 51 style", and praised the music for its unique take on classical music. However he generally faulted the gameplay and called the graphics the worst he had seen for the DS.|$|E

500|$|Monteverdi is lauded {{by modern}} critics as [...] "the most {{significant}} composer in late Renaissance and early Baroque Italy"; [...] "one {{of the principal}} composers {{in the history of}} Western music"; and, routinely, as the first great opera composer. These assessments reflect a contemporary perspective, since his music was largely unknown to the composers that followed him for three centuries after his death. It is, as Redlich and others have pointed out, the composers of the late 20th and 21st century that have identified with Monteverdi and sought to make his music a basis for their own. Possibly, as Chew suggests, they are attracted by Monteverdi's reputation as [...] "a Modern, a breaker of rules, against the Ancients, those who deferred to ancient authority" [...] – although the composer was, essentially, a pragmatist, [...] "showing <b>what</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> described as an opportunistic and eclectic willingness to use whatever lay to hand for the purpose". In a letter dated 16 October 1633 Monteverdi appears to endorse the view of himself as a [...] "modern": [...] "I would rather be moderately praised for the new style than greatly praised for the ordinary". However, Chew, in his final summation, sees the composer historically as facing both ways, willing to use modern techniques but {{while at the same time}} protective of his status as a competent composer in the stile antico. Thus, says Chew, [...] "his achievement was both retrospective and progressive". Monteverdi represents the late Renaissance era while simultaneously summing up much of the early Baroque. [...] "And in one respect in particular, his achievement was enduring: the effective projection of human emotions in music, in a way adequate for theatre as well as for chamber music." ...|$|E

40|$|Viewing emotion {{regulation}} as {{a process}} that occurs during the generation of emotion and {{with the aim of}} self-maintenance rather than self-control is emphasized. In a self-maintenance view, the cognitive system is seen as receiving information from the emotion system as well as influencing it, and self-maintenance is seen as occurring (largely below conscious awareness) by means of dynamic processes that involve both self- and other regulation. It is suggested that the field has yet to pay adequate attention to implicit and relational processes of regulation. An issue of major clinical significance is the importance of generating theory and research to help understand to what extent automatic emotion processes can be changed through deliberate conscious cognitive processes of self-control and to <b>what</b> extent they <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>be</b> changed through more implicit processes based on new emotional and/or relational experience...|$|R
