5|$|To find {{suitable}} {{candidates to}} live with the three actors, producers auditioned roughly 10,000 people, who <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would be taking part in a new reality television programme in London called Making Friends. Six members of the public, named Barrington, Bob, Dave, David, Jessica and Shirine, were selected to feature on the show.|$|E
5|$|Bedsitcom was {{commissioned}} by the Channel Four Television Corporation and produced by Objective Productions. Producers auditioned thousands of people to be the show's genuine contestants and selected from them six young adults {{to live in the}} flat with the three actors. These six contestants <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would be starring in a new reality TV series called Making Friends, and featured on the show three at a time over a period of eight weeks. The programme ran for a single series of eight episodes and featured various storylines, involving dead goldfish, dodgy dealings, promiscuous mothers and telephone psychics.|$|E

5|$|Cagliostro's Egyptian Rite In 1784, in Bordeaux, the man {{calling himself}} Count Alessandro di Cagliostro opened the first lodge of his Egyptian Rite masonry. This had the three degrees of normal French masonry (Apprentice, Companion and Master), {{but with a}} greatly different, more mystical ritual. Cagliostro claimed that he was re-introducing true Freemasonry, and he {{attempted}} to attract candidates wherever he went. Male candidates were already Freemasons, but women were also admitted. The ceremony for the two sexes differed only in minor points - males were admitted by Cagliostro (the Grand Copht) and females by his wife (the Queen of Sheba). On admission, the women <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were now Freemasons.|$|E
5|$|The coup was {{organised}} {{with the}} help of some VNQDĐ and Đại Việt members, civilians and officers alike. Đông enlisted the cooperation of an armoured regiment, marine unit and three paratrooper battalions. The marine battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Pham Van Lieu. The operation was scheduled to launch on November 11 at 05:00. However, the airborne soldiers were not aware of what their officers had in store. They <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were heading into the countryside to attack the Viet Cong. Once they were on their way, the officers claimed that the Presidential Guard, who were meant to guard the presidential palace, had mutinied against Diệm.|$|E
5|$|In April 1939 Britten and Pears {{sailed to}} North America, going first to Canada {{and then to}} New York. They had several reasons for leaving England, {{including}} the difficult position of pacifists in an increasingly bellicose Europe; the success that Frank Bridge had enjoyed in the US; the departure of Auden and his friend Christopher Isherwood to the US from England three months previously; hostile or belittling reviews of Britten's music in the English press; and under-rehearsed and inadequate performances. Britten and Pears consummated their relationship and from then until Britten's death they were partners in both their professional and personal lives. When the Second World War began, Britten and Pears turned for advice to the British embassy in Washington and <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> should remain in the US as artistic ambassadors. Pears was inclined to disregard the advice {{and go back to}} England; Britten also felt the urge to return, but accepted the embassy's counsel and persuaded Pears to do the same.|$|E

5|$|The new Virginia {{counties}} {{were growing}} rapidly, {{and with this}} growth came trouble. Trigg was appointed {{as one of the}} judges to the Virginia Land Court commission of 1779–80 charged with settling land disputes in Kentucky County, Virginia. The Virginia Land Act of 1779 had set up this court of four judges in order to examine the numerous land claims and to certify valid titles. The four judges arrived at St. Asaph in October and triggered emigration to Kentucky as people wished to either certify their claims or seek unclaimed land. They closed their court on February 26, 1780, and prepared to return home. However, in March they <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had to reopen the court and stay through April, as claimants were delayed due to weather. Trigg and two fellow judges reconvened on April 16 and heard another 134 cases. In all, the court judged 1,328 claims covering over 1 million acres (4,000km²) of land. After these sessions ended, Trigg stayed and established his home on 1,000 acres (4km²) of land at Trigg's Station about four miles (6km) north-west of Harrodsburg in Kentucky County, Virginia.|$|E
25|$|The last {{aspect of}} SOG's {{original}} missions consisted of psychological operations conducted against North Vietnam.

They <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would never interact with the same person in the reciprocal role. A player's history of donating was displayed at each anonymous interaction, and donations were significantly more frequent to receivers who had been generous to others in earlier interactions. Indirect reciprocity has only been shown to occur in humans.|$|E
25|$|In an {{original}} meeting on 10 July, Yorkshire were summoned to Old Trafford and <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{were to be}} ejected from the tournament, with Nottinghamshire to be reinstated in the draw. However, Yorkshire appealed and at a second meeting held on 14 July, their appeal was heard and rejected, but this time Glamorgan were placed into the draw on a superior run rate, because Nottinghamshire were not awarded the points for the 27 June game.|$|E

They <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> must draft a new letter, this time {{in the name of the}} Party, not the Bogd Khaan, stating their objectives and requests.

25|$|Many Sioux {{continued}} {{to cross the}} border to seek refuge. Sitting Bull did not arrive in Wood Mountain until May 1877 when he and his band of 135 lodges crossed into Canada. While camping in White Mud Creek, Sitting Bull and his party were met by North West Mounted Police officers commanded by Major James Morrow Walsh. They <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could stay in Canada as long as they abided the laws and did not cross the border to raid the United States.|$|E
25|$|On December 1, six {{students}} were threatened to get arrested for unauthorized protests {{that took place}} on November 29.

The police left to inform the superiors and never returned after the students told them that they would not accept the release on bail but would rather get arrested. The six accused students, also the members of ABFSU, waited at Taungoo train station until 10 pm for the police to show up but then left.|$|E

The children threatened with mild punishment had to justify, to themselves, why they did not play with the forbidden toy. The degree of punishment, in itself, was insufficiently strong to resolve their cognitive dissonance; the children had to convince themselves that playing with the forbidden toy was not worth the effort.|$|E
25|$|In Spring 2012, protesters set up dual occupations of Peavey Plaza and Loring Park in {{downtown}} Minneapolis. Organizers and activists <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could erect tents {{for the use}} of storage during the resurgence. Late in the day of the reoccupation police communicated to protesters that they were planning to selectively enforce ordinances derived from the Minneapolis City Attorney's office stating that protesters and their equipment were interfering with, and blocking the public right of way. This selectively enforced local ordinance led to an escalation that resulted in both arrests, and the excessive use of force by the Minneapolis Police Department.|$|E
25|$|The Departmental Judge Advocate General, Colonel George Dunn, {{reviewed}} {{the record of}} the first court martial (known as “the Nesbit Case.”) and approved the sentences.

Six days later, thirteen of the prisoners (including Corporal Baltimore) <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would be hanged for murder, but they were not informed of the time or place. The court recommended clemency for a Private Hudson, but General Ruckman declined to grant it.
