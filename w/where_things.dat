5|$|Two years later, Mark {{returns to}} Erinsborough. He tells Kate that Holland has died, {{so he was}} able to leave witness protection. Mark {{explains}} that his death had to be faked after Holland put out a hit on him. After learning that Kate had been asking about him, he believed that she wanted to see him again. Mark explains that he has been living in the Blue Mountains and working as an abseiling instructor. Mark and Kate spend time together, which makes her boyfriend, Mason, jealous. Mark also catches up with Lucas and Kyle. He tries to persuade Kate that her future is with him and they kiss. But when Mason learns Mark has a girlfriend in Sydney, he tells Kate, resulting in a fight between himself and Mark. Mark tells Kate {{that he was going to}} propose to his girlfriend, but wanted to see <b>where</b> <b>things</b> stood between them first. Kate chooses Mason and Mark leaves. Months later, Mason runs into Mark in Lysterfield, where he asks for his help as Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) has been injured abseiling. Mark accompanies the group to the hospital, where he runs into Kate. Mark decides to stay in Erinsborough and is offered a job at Fitzgerald Motors by Danni Ferguson (Laura McIntosh). He also moves into Number 24.|$|E

25|$|The family's {{finances}} did not flourish, and Aunt Branwell {{spent the}} money with caution. Emily had a visceral need {{of her home}} and the countryside that surrounded it, and to leave it would cause her to languish and wither. Charlotte and Anne, being more realistic, did not hesitate in finding work and from April 1839 to December 1841 the two sisters had several posts as governesses. Not staying long with each family, their employment would last for some months or a single season. However, Anne did stay with the Robinsons in Thorp Green <b>where</b> <b>things</b> went well, from May 1840 to June 1845.|$|E

25|$|In late 1972 Tek {{had joined}} the band TV Jones as lead singer/guitarist along with Chris Jones on guitar, Gerry Jones on drums (brother of the now {{successful}} jazz trumpet player Vince Jones), Giles Vanderwerf on bass. TV Jones had a fanatical cult following in Wollongong, to the point <b>where</b> <b>things</b> got crazed and dangerous where by in 1974, the group fled north of the city. The band was hopeful of success, but amid disastrous engagements at Chequers and the Whisky A Go Go, ran afoul of both the police and organised crime simultaneously. After unsuccessful album recording sessions in North Sydney, the group began to disintegrate, sacking Tek from TV Jones as a negative influence.|$|E
25|$|In 1821 the NWC was {{merged into}} their {{powerful}} competitor, the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC). Douglas' contract was placed onto the HBC's payroll. He quickly {{moved up the}} strict system <b>where</b> <b>things</b> or people are in separate levels of importance of the company. In 1825, he {{was put in charge}} of the founding of the Fort Dark red trading post in what is now northern Alberta. He was next assigned at Fort St. James on Stuart Lake, headquarters of the Company's New Caledonia District, roughly located within modern British Columbia. In 1827 he established Fort Connolly on Bear Lake. The station was named after his manager William Connolly, who was impressed by Douglas' skills and viewed him favourably. Because of their close relations, Connolly agreed to Douglas marrying his Métis daughter Amelia Connolly. Her mother was Cree and likely also Métis. Douglas and Amelia were married on 27 April 1828 'à la façon du pays', a ceremony repeated almost a decade later at Fort Vancouver.|$|E
25|$|The Saints' first release after Kuepper's {{departure}} was {{the live}} EP, Paralytic Tonight, Dublin Tomorrow, in March 1980 on Lost Records with Bailey producing. It {{was followed by}} a studio album, The Monkey Puzzle, co-produced by Bailey and Gerry Nixon for Mushroom Records in February 1981. It reached the Top100 on the Australian Albums Chart. They had shifted to a more melodic pop-rock sound and included Hay on keyboards in the line-up. Hay left again before the next album was released in Australia in 1982 as I Thought This Was Love, But This Ain't Casablanca on Mushroom Records and elsewhere as Out in the Jungle... <b>Where</b> <b>Things</b> Ain't So Pleasant on New Rose Records. Production was credited to Ricardo Mentalban, and with Bailey, in The Saints, were Hall on bass guitar and Iain Shedden (ex-The Jolt) on drums. Additional musicians included Roger Crankwell on saxophone and clarinet, Denis Haines on piano, Paul Neiman on trombone, Steve Sidwell on trumpet and Jess Sutcliffe on piano. The Damned's Brian James guested on lead guitar.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} there are cases <b>where</b> two <b>things</b> can be {{rendered}} impure in succession by a corpse, {{one of those things}} being rendered impure with a seven-day impurity and the other thing being rendered impure with an impurity lasting until the evening. There are cases <b>where</b> three <b>things</b> can be rendered impure in succession by a corpse, two of those things being rendered impure with a seven-day impurity and the remaining thing with an impurity lasting until the evening. And there are cases <b>where</b> four <b>things</b> can be rendered impure in succession by a corpse, three of those things being rendered impure with a seven-day impurity and the remaining thing with an impurity lasting until the evening.|$|R

60|$|Having now {{defined the}} {{perspective}} {{which is the}} place <b>where</b> a given <b>thing</b> is, we can understand {{what is meant by}} saying that the perspectives in which a thing looks large are nearer to the thing than those in which it looks small: they are, in fact, nearer to the perspective which is the place <b>where</b> the <b>thing</b> is.|$|R
25|$|Within ASL {{there is}} a class of indexical (often called 'directional') verbs. These include the signs for 'see', 'pay', 'give', 'show', 'invite', 'help', 'send', 'bite', etc. These verbs include an element of motion that indexes one or more referents, either {{physically}} present or set up through the referent locus system. If there are two loci, the first indicates the subject and the second the object, direct or indirect depending on the verb, reflecting the basic word order of ASL. For example, 'give' is a bi-indexical verb based on a flattened M/O handshape. For 'I give you', the hand moves from myself toward you; for 'you give me', it moves from you to me. 'See' is indicated with a V handshape. Two loci for a dog and a cat can be set up, with the sign moving between them to indicate 'the dog sees the cat' (if it starts at the locus for dog and moves toward the locus for cat) or 'the cat sees the dog' (with the motion in the opposite direction), or the V hand can circulate between both loci and myself to mean 'we (the dog, the cat, and myself) see each other'. The verb 'to be in pain' (index fingers pointed {{at each other and}} alkuately approaching and separating) is signed at the location of the pain (head for headache, cheek for toothache, abdomen for stomachache, etc.). This is normally done in relation to the signer's own body, regardless of the person feeling the pain, but may take also use the locus system, especially for body parts which are not normally part of the sign space, such as the leg. There are also spatial verbs such as put-up and put-below, which allow signers to specify <b>where</b> <b>things</b> are or how they moved them around.|$|E
500|$|A [...] "New Definitive Edition" [...] {{appeared}} in 2002, with two added pages of contextual endnotes, {{something he had}} been increasingly doing from 1995 with his cartoon essay [...] "My Mom Was a Schizophrenic". [...] In the 1994 collection the backgrounds were black; he changed them to white and rearranged the panels for the [...] "New Definitive Edition". [...] He explained: [...] "I like austerity. The white background looks more austere to me." [...] The edition included a short appendix for readers [...] "wondering when and <b>where</b> <b>things</b> happened".|$|E
500|$|Shakur and the Death Row crew {{attended}} a boxing match in Las Vegas, {{where he was}} murdered in 1996. [...] In retrospect of the events which ensued {{only a few months}} afterward, the song has been viewed as the turning point in the feud between Shakur and Biggie, <b>where</b> <b>things</b> were said and rapped which could never be taken back during the remainder of Shakur's life. This has led to it being dubbed as {{the beginning of the war}} between the East Coast and the West Coast, and the centerpiece in what became the most venomous battle in rap history.|$|E

500|$|Borders {{are another}} theme in Chatwin's work. According to Elizabeth Chatwin, he [...] "was {{interested}} in borders, <b>where</b> <b>things</b> were always changing, not {{one thing or}} another." [...] Patagonia, {{the subject of his}} first published book, is an area that is in both Argentina and Chile. The Viceroy of Ouidah is a Brazilian who trades slaves in Dahomey. On the Black Hills takes place on the borders of Wales and England. In The Songlines the characters the protagonist mostly interacts with are people who provide a bridge between the Aboriginal and white Australian worlds. The main character in Utz travels {{back and forth across the}} Iron Curtain.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} At Folsom Prison revitalized Cash's career; {{according}} to Cash, [...] "that's <b>where</b> <b>things</b> really got started for me again". Sun Records re-dubbed Cash's previous B-side [...] "Get Rhythm" [...] with applause similar to Folsom's, {{and it became}} successful enough to enter the Hot 100. Cash returned to the prison scene in 1969 when he recorded At San Quentin at San Quentin State Prison. At San Quentin became Cash's first album to hit {{number one on the}} Pop chart and produced the number two hit [...] "A Boy Named Sue". The ensuing popularity from the Folsom concert also prompted ABC to give Cash his own television show.|$|E
500|$|To prevent Channel Orange from leaking {{onto the}} Internet, Ocean planned {{to release it}} {{digitally}} one week earlier than its publicly announced date. He was inspired by Jay-Z and Kanye West, who prevented their 2011 album Watch the Throne from leaking by announcing several misleading release dates. On June 8, Ocean announced a July 17 release date and released a trailer for the album directed by Nabil Elderkin. On July 9, he made his television debut on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and performed [...] "Bad Religion" [...] with backing from the show's house band The Roots and a strings section. The show announced the album's actual release date and vendor, Universal Music Group, who made it available on July 10 as a digital download on iTunes. Ocean said at the time, [...] "I haven't even held one in my hands ... The [...] are done, but when we sent them in, they were locked down at the manufacturer. They haven't left. They never went on trucks [...] because that's <b>where</b> <b>things</b> leak." ...|$|E

500|$|As a captain, Woodfull {{was known}} for his courage and high moral {{principles}} {{in the face of the}} bodyline series. Fellow player Stan McCabe described him as [...] "the greatest man I ever met", while wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield said that he had never met a more exemplary character. Oldfield said that Woodfull was a psychologist and humanitarian in addition to a captain. Bradman attributed Woodfull's success to his ability to command the intense loyalty of his players and convert it into team spirit. Bill O'Reilly said that Woodfull's men [...] "all held imperishable memories of his personal touch and his courage". Ray Robinson said that [...] "nobody thought Bill Woodfull the cat's whiskers as a strokeplayer but his many qualities made him a pre-eminent leader of men". He added that [...] "Woodfull's unrivalled selflessness won fidelity bordering on devotion". Australian cricket writer Jack Pollard said that [...] "Woodfull had the habit of being <b>where</b> <b>things</b> were tough, and he brought rare dignity to the Australian captaincy". Pollard compared the respect he commanded from his players to that of Ian Chappell. The English writer RC Robertson-Glasgow said of Woodfull: ...|$|E
500|$|The second {{music video}} for [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] was also {{directed}} by Motellet Film. It was filmed at a Swedish {{club in the}} span of three days, where the singer spent time with three friends who were asked to [...] "have a few drinks and make out" [...] with her. Consequently, the directors filmed a large amount of natural footage because there was not a specific [...] "direction". Regarding the fact that two of her friends were women, Lo expressed: [...] "There are girls in there—one of them is my best friend. That should be OK, that shouldn't even be a thing." [...] In the video, the singer wanted to [...] "show this kind of night <b>where</b> <b>things</b> can get out of control" [...] and the viewers to [...] "go slowly into this emotional turmoil" [...] represented in the lyrics of the song. She explained: [...] "I want people to know what I'm feeling. I want it to really reflect the song. So I wanted to make a video that I'm not able to watch, which is kind of what it is." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues" [...] {{continues}} {{the theme of}} road weariness from the album's previous song, [...] "Highway 61 Revisited." [...] The singer finds himself in Juarez, Mexico, at Easter time, amidst sickness, despair, whores and saints. While there, he encounters corrupt authorities and women of dubious character, named in the song as [...] "Saint Annie" [...] and [...] "sweet Melinda", before seeking succor in drugs and alcohol. The song establishes a nightmare vision as the singer is influenced by gravity, negativity, sex, drugs, drink, illness, remorse and memory. In the song's final verse, the singer decides he has had enough and finds the means to leave it all behind and head back to New York City, <b>where</b> <b>things</b> may be better. Author Paul Williams has noted that scene and situation are combined into a gorgeous evocation of muddied consciousness in [...] "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues", without ever resolving into {{a clear picture of}} what the song is about. Despite the sordid details of the singer's experiences in Juarez, the lyrics maintain a sense of humor, and William Ruhlmann of the AllMusic website considers the song a comic tour de force.|$|E

500|$|Fark tweaked {{its site}} design {{a little more}} on June 1, 2011, with the comment, [...] "Fark's {{redesign}} will go live at 5PM EST. Heads-up {{for those of you}} who missed the other warning threads and need a place to completely lose your mind." [...] Having learned from the controversy caused by the 2007 redesign, Curtis introduced the new site as a preview one week (two weeks for TotalFark users) prior to June 1, to allow users to comment on the changes and provide feedback on <b>where</b> <b>things</b> were broken. The primary reason for the redesigned site is to make it easier to use and more intuitive. The site's tagline was changed from [...] "It's not news, it's FARK" [...] to [...] "We don't make news. We mock it." [...] The music tab was also dropped, due to low usage – content was rolled into the Showbiz or Video tab, where most of the content was already cross-posted anyway. An overhaul to the Fark Mobile Web site was not done at this time, but Curtis did say that small changes would be implemented over time to make the mobile site more consistent with the overall design of the new site.|$|E
500|$|All four episodes were {{directed}} by Lee Salisbury, who learned {{three weeks before}} filming {{that he would be}} working on the episodes, and said he was [...] "a bit dumbstruck" [...] to discover he would be directing the fire episodes and Windsor's departure, but that he was proud to do so. He said his main aim for the fire was to show the fear, panic and pandemonium that comes when a fire starts and quickly spreads. He wanted the story to be character-led rather than led by the fire, saying that the fire [...] "almost becomes a backdrop". Salisbury said it was hard to make the fire look real because [...] "you can't actually set fire to stuff". As the fire lasted for some time, characters' scenes could be divided up into small sections. Salisbury commented: [...] "Bryan Kirkwood, the writer [...] and myself also wanted it to be an episode <b>where</b> <b>things</b> kept happening and the audience would keep thinking, 'Wow, that must have been the explosion' or 'That must have been the stunt'. But more things keep happening and happening, and I think that's what people will find really shocking." [...] The production team had several production meetings for the weeks' worth of episodes, whereas there is usually just one.|$|E
500|$|... "Wichita Linebacker" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a 7.0 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} [...] "good". Despite this, he wrote a mixed review, opining that [...] "as far as mysteries go, this was a so-so one," [...] that [...] "the Hearst campus rapist story just doesn't {{seem to be getting}} the proper weight it requires," [...] and that [...] "there's also some strange tonal issues currently." [...] However, he praised the return of Weevil. Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, was also relatively critical, while focusing praise on Weevil's storyline. He referred to [...] "Wichita Linebacker" [...] as [...] "what I would expect were the show not so ambitious. Here, Veronica isn't going to Hearst College, she's going to Television College, <b>where</b> <b>things</b> that are college-y happen." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "C+". [...] "I don't think it's being overly harsh to say that this was not one of this show's stronger or more exciting episodes. The writing was oddly flat, in the first place, and the attention to detail was subpar as well." [...] In addition, the reviewer criticized the show's treatment of its relationships. [...] "That's one of the things that's made this show great in the past -- layering in complex and important relationships while not actually being a relationship-centered show. I only hope they go somewhere with the gambling thing, because otherwise, in my opinion, this episode will have been a total waste of time." ...|$|E
