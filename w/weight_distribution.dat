5|$|After {{examining}} {{the practice of}} other British railways, Richard Maunsell, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, secured agreement for a 4-cylinder design, with an improved boiler and Belpaire firebox.

The new design was an inevitable compromise between {{the need for additional}} power and to keep the weight down to an acceptable limit.|$|E

The {{in general}} hard problem of {{computing}} <b>weight</b> <b>distributions</b> of linear codes is {{considered for the}} special class of algebraic-geometric codes, defined by Goppa in the early eighties.

40|$|Abstract — Asymptotic {{concentration}} {{behaviors of}} linear combinations of <b>weight</b> <b>distributions</b> on the random linear code ensemble are presented. Many important properties of a binary linear code {{can be expressed}} as {{the form of a}} linear combination of <b>weight</b> <b>distributions</b> such as number of codewords, undetected error probability and upper bound on the maximum likelihood error probability. The key in this analysis is the covariance formula of <b>weight</b> <b>distributions</b> of the random linear code ensemble, which reveals the second-order statistics of a linear function of the <b>weight</b> <b>distributions.</b> Based on the covariance formula, several expressions of the asymptotic concentration rate, which indicate the speed of convergence to the average, are derived.

In this paper, we compute the <b>weight</b> <b>distributions</b> of three classes of cyclic codes with Niho exponents.

5|$|Amtrak {{inherited}} {{an aging}} and mechanically-incompatible fleet of diesel locomotives from various private railroads on its startup in 1971. The most modern locomotives remained {{in private hands}} to operate the various commuter services which, by law, did not pass to Amtrak. To replace these Amtrak ordered 150 EMD SDP40F locomotives, which began entering service in 1973. These were supplemented by 25 GE P30CHs which entered service in 1975. The SDP40F was a troubled design; problems with <b>weight</b> <b>distribution</b> led {{to a series of}} derailments in the mid-1970s. Meanwhile, the poor truck design of the P30CH (and the electric GE E60CP) curtailed further orders of that unit when Amtrak found itself needing more short- and medium-distance power in the spring of 1975.|$|E

5|$|Third, {{because the}} front and rear tires can have {{different}} slip angles due to <b>weight</b> <b>distribution,</b> tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. When understeering, the steering angle must be greater, and when oversteering, the steering angle must be less than it would be if the slip angles were equal to maintain a given turn radius. Some authors even use the term counter-steering to refer to the need on some bikes under some conditions to steer in the opposite direction of the turn (negative steering angle) to maintain control in response to significant rear wheel slippage.|$|E
5|$|Tires {{generate}} the lateral forces necessary for steering and balance {{through a combination}} of cornering force and camber thrust. Tire inflation pressures have also been found to be important variables in the behavior of a motorcycle at high speeds. Because the front and rear tires can have different slip angles due to <b>weight</b> <b>distribution,</b> tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. Of the two, understeer, in which the front wheel slides more than the rear wheel, is more dangerous since front wheel steering is critical for maintaining balance.|$|E

Kings Dominion later explained the closure through a statement released on their official Facebook page on August 28, 2013, which stated that a problem with the <b>weight</b> <b>distribution</b> on the gearbox caused a part to warp and fail. The replacement part had to be custom-built in another country, causing the extended closure. The ride eventually reopened on September 14, 2013.|$|E

5|$|The Iazyges used hanging {{barrel-shaped}} pots {{that were}} asymmetrical, and had uneven <b>weight</b> <b>distribution.</b> The rope to hang the pot was {{wrapped around the}} edges of the side collar, it is believed that the rope was tied tightly to the pot, allowing the pot to spin in circles, due to the spinning motion, several theories have been made of the use of the pots. It is believed that the smaller hanging pots were used to ferment alcohol, by use of the seeds of touch-me-not balsam (Impatiens noli-tangere), and the larger hanging pots were used to churn butter and make cheese. They were cattle breeders, and as such required salt in order to preserve their meat, however, the Iazyges had no salt mines within their land. According to Dio, the Iazyges received grain from the Romans.|$|E
5|$|The formula {{was enacted}} as law {{to limit the}} weight-to-length ratio of a {{commercial}} motor vehicle (CMV). The formula is necessary to prevent the concentrated weight on a truck's axle from producing stress on bridge members (possibly causing a bridge collapse). In simplified form, this is analogous to a person walking on thin ice. When standing upright, a person's weight is concentrated {{at the bottom of}} their feet, funneling all of their weight into a small area. When lying down, a person's weight is distributed over a much larger area. This difference in <b>weight</b> <b>distribution</b> would allow a person to cross an area of ice while crawling that might otherwise collapse under their body weight while standing up. For an overweight truck to comply with the formula, more axles must be added, the distance between axles must be increased, or weight must be removed.|$|E
5|$|Engine {{packaging}} {{became a}} contentious issue during development. Holden's designers wanted the engine positioned well {{behind the front}} axle to allow short overhangs and an overall sportier appearance, whereas the crash engineers were concerned that this would reduce the body's impact absorption in an accident. Negotiation between designers and crash engineers resulted in moving some of the engine components, including relocating the battery to the boot, freeing up valuable front-end space. By having the engine moved back and further down, the VE Commodore also benefits from near perfect 50:50 <b>weight</b> <b>distribution</b> across all variants, leading to superior handling. Crash engineers introduced several other safety initiatives, including relocating the fuel tank {{in front of the}} rear-axle line, instead of behind. A more crash-resistant rear-end was also seen as necessary. The design though had to incorporate a spacious boot and a spare-wheel bay that could house the largest-sized wheel to be fitted to the car. Crash test results from Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) rate the VE lower in the offset frontal impact test than the previous generation Commodore. The overall crash score was marginally higher than the outgoing VZ, due to improvements in side impact protection giving a score of 27.45 out of 37 or a four star rating out of a possible five.|$|E
