Agnes believes herself to be the fulcrum of the family, keeping everyone in balance. She often maintains this balance, or order, by not confronting issues, not taking a stand, and not processing emotions.

The song was originally recorded on the Tour Bus in Europe in 2010, {{and was later}} remixed at Larrabee Sound Studios in North Hollywood, California by Trevor Muzzy. Gaga said that the song was inspired {{after a night of}} partying at the Laboratory nightclub in Berlin, Germany. The next day, she wrote [...] "Scheiße", stating that she [...] "meant [...] like 'shit, it's good.' But I also meant it the other way; because this song is really about wanting to be a strong female without all the bullshit that comes along <b>with.</b> <b>Anything</b> <b>that</b> gets in your way from being brave. It's not the only word I know, I just like that word. It's sexy." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for The Observer, Leo Robson found the novel to be {{somewhat}} underwhelming, stating that [...] "It is disappointing, given {{the vitality of the}} novel's setting and set-up, that Miller fails to achieve corresponding dynamism in the development of plot and character", adding that [...] "as a prose writer, Miller appears averse to taking risks, which means no pratfalls – but no glory either". He found the [...] "engineer's progress and his setbacks are narrated in a patient, tight-lipped present tense, and just as the novel rarely concerns itself <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> doesn't impinge on the destruction of Les Innocents, so it rarely deviates from its obsessive regime of description and dialogue". He did somewhat temper this, however, stating that [...] "It is one of the historical novel's advantages over the topical or journalistic novel that the benchmark is plausibility rather than verifiable authenticity. Success in this effort requires a capacity for immersion and a degree of imagination, and whatever his shortcomings as a prose writer and a storyteller, Andrew Miller is endowed with both." ...|$|E
500|$|La Rivière also cites {{external}} influences that, in his view, {{did not work}} in favour of The Secret Service. He expounds on the continuing popularity of earlier Anderson puppet productions {{as far back as}} the pre-Supermarionation series The Adventures of Twizzle (1959), and the frequent repeat runs that they had on ATV throughout the 1960s: [...] "... as <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> is phenomenally popular, the time must come when the audience is satiated and drifts away to something else." [...] Fryer suggests that the espionage theme may not have been attractive to potential foreign buyers, noting that the American spy series The Man from U.N.C.L.E. had been cancelled in 1968 and that the last episode of The Avengers had aired in the UK the following year. Fryer considers the production of [...] "a spy series just when the fad for the genre was waning" [...] was the biggest problem that faced The Secret Service in finding an audience. On the other hand, it is argued that, in light of the release of Century 21's Doppelgänger (1969), a live-action film that preceded UFO, the Supermarionation format had become outdated. Archer and Hearn express similar concerns about expectations for a new Supermarionation series in 1969, writing that Anderson and his colleagues had become [...] "a bit too successful" [...] in producing a winning format.|$|E

500|$|At Regent's Park David {{made little}} {{professional}} progress. The company was distinguished, headed by Nigel Playfair and Jack Hawkins, and, in the leading female roles, Anna Neagle and Margaretta Scott. David {{was restricted to}} bit parts. Among her colleagues in the company was an actor nine years her senior, Charles Gibson Cowan. His disregard for social conventions appealed strongly to her, and she also found him sexually irresistible. His being married did not daunt either of them, and they began an affair that outlasted her stage career. According to an interview with Chaney, [...] "Cowan was the ultimate outsider. He was working class, left wing, Jewish, an actor, a pickpocket, a vagabond, who lived in caves in Hastings for a time. Her mother called him a 'pacifist worm'. He was a sexual presence, and slept <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> moved." [...] David's mother strongly disapproved, and tried {{to put a stop}} to the affair. She arranged for her daughter to spend several weeks holidaying with family and friends in Malta in the first half of 1936 and in Egypt later in the same year, but in her 1999 biography Artemis Cooper comments that David's lengthy absence failed to detach her from her involvement with Cowan. During her stay in Malta, David was able to spend time learning from her hostess's cook, Angela, who was happy to pass on her expertise. Although she could produce elaborate grand dinners when required, the most important lesson she taught David was to work day in, day out, with all available ingredients, showing her how to make an old bird or a stringy piece of meat into a good dish.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{works in}} the Classic manner, {{attributed}} to Inigo Jones, or to his carver, Nicholas Stone, had been executed twenty years before in Oxford, and the Chapel has much {{more in common with}} the Porch of St. Mary's Church than <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> Wren ever did. One historian, T. G.

The triumph of the miners in a highly challenging environment could also increase their self-confidence and strengthen bonds with each other and with their families.

The Times called the 1884 revival [...] "distinctly {{a step in}} the right direction" [...] and in 1898 the paper claimed that [...] "The Sorcerer is very far from having exhausted its popularity". [...] A review of the 1886 Australian production ranked the opera in [...] "a middle place in Gilbert and Sullivan compositions. [...] Abounding in tuneful numbers, one or two of which rank <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> has come from Sir Arthur Sullivan's pen, the orchestration is thin compared with that of his later operas and its melodies have never taken the same popular hold as those of Pinafore, a work of about equal calibre from a musical point of view. ...

2500|$|Bishop did not {{see herself}} as a [...] "lesbian poet" [...] or as a [...] "female poet". Because she refused to have her work {{published}} in all-female poetry anthologies, other female poets involved with the women's movement thought she was hostile towards the movement. For instance, a student at Harvard who was close to Bishop in the 60s, Kathleen Spivack, wrote in her memoir, [...] "I think Bishop internalized the misogyny of the time. How could she not? ... Bishop had a very ambivalent relation to being a woman plus poet—plus lesbian—in the Boston/Cambridge/Harvard nexus ... Extremely vulnerable, sensitive, she hid much of her private life. She {{wanted nothing to do}} <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> seemed to involve the women's movement. She internalized many of the male attitudes of the day toward women, who were supposed to be attractive, appealing to men, and not ask for equal pay or a job with benefits." [...] However, this was not how Bishop necessarily viewed herself. In an interview with The Paris Review from 1978, she said that, despite her insistence on being excluded from female poetry anthologies, she still considered herself to be [...] "a strong feminist" [...] but that she only wanted to be judged based on the quality of her writing and not on her gender or sexual orientation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{advice to}} cover one's exposed skin <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> can cast a shadow, like the picnic blanket and {{newspaper}} {{used by the}} family in the film, may seem absurd at first when one considers the capabilities of a nuclear weapon, but even the thinnest of barriers such as cloth or plant leaves would reduce the severity of burns on the skin from the thermal radiation( [...] the thermal radiation/flash is light, similar in average emission spectrum/color to sun light, emitting in the ultraviolet, visible light, and infrared range but with a higher light intensity than sunlight, with this combination of light rays capable of delivering radiant burning energy to exposed skin areas. While the duration of emittance of this burning thermal radiation, which can be experienced by people within range, increases with yield, it is usually at least a few seconds long.) Furthermore, great importance is given to closing eyelids and covering the location of the eyes as temporary and permanent flash blindness is a risk potential without this covering, especially at night. A photograph taken about 1.3km from the hypocenter of the Hiroshima bomb explosion showed that the shadowing effect of leaves from a nearby shrub protected a wooden utilities pole from charring discoloration due to the burst of thermal radiation, however the rest of the telephone pole, not under the protection of the leaves, was charred almost completely black.|$|E

2500|$|Jeffrey Donovan as Michael Westen: [...] former US Army Special Forces {{soldier and}} a current CIA {{contractor}} {{who has been}} burned (identified as an unreliable or dangerous agent) and now finds himself {{in his hometown of}} Miami, unable to leave. With his assets frozen, he is forced to live off his wits and any small investigative jobs he can find while he searches for answers about who has burned him and why. Highly skilled and extremely clever, he can think on his feet, often improvising electronic devices and using ordinary items ranging from duct tape to cake frosting in highly unorthodox ways to complete a job. He has two black belts or, as he puts it in one episode, [...] "thirty years of karate" [...] and is [...] "rated <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> fires a bullet or holds an edge". He has an uncanny ability to assume cover identities, working in numerous regional dialects and international accents; however, he cannot speak Spanish fluently. He believes that his unhappy childhood, largely at the hands of an abusive father, has helped to make him into a natural covert operative while also making close relationships difficult for him. He has a younger brother, Nate (Seth Peterson), who appeared in several episodes before being killed by a sniper in Season 6. Michael presents himself as a cynic hardened by experience but occasionally reveals a soft, and sometimes vulnerable, side. His favorite food is yogurt, which is featured or eaten by {{at least one of the}} characters in each episode. He has a romantic relationship with Fiona. In the series finale he and Fiona are living in Ireland raising Charlie (Nate's son) as their own child.|$|E
2500|$|Bartemius [...] "Barty" [...] Crouch Sr. was {{the head}} of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement when Voldemort first came to power. Crouch was {{somewhat}} megalomaniacal and intensely preoccupied with presenting the appearance of respectability. Crouch was a narrow, inflexible man who stiffly followed the rules. Though he despised the Dark Arts, the lengths to which he was willing to go to disassociate <b>with</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> might blemish his reputation led him to behave almost as cruelly as many on the Dark Side, and gave Aurors powers to kill rather than capture suspected Death Eaters who resisted arrest. He sent Sirius Black to the wizard prison Azkaban without a trial. Crouch appeared to be the favorite to become the next Minister for Magic until his son, Barty Crouch Jr., was caught with the Lestranges, Death Eaters who were trying to bring Voldemort back to power. Crouch gave his son a trial before sending him to Azkaban; however, according to Sirius, the trial was a sham, merely a public demonstration of how much he hated the boy. About a year after the trial, Crouch's terminally ill wife begged for her son's life to be saved, so Crouch abetted the two in trading appearances using Polyjuice Potion, and Mrs Crouch took her son's place in Azkaban. After the supposed death of his son in prison, public sympathy fell on Crouch Jr; the wizarding world placed all the blame on Crouch Sr., accusing him of driving his son to join the Death Eaters because of his neglect of his family. After the scandal, Crouch lost much of his popularity and he was shunted sideways to a post as the head of the Department of International Magical Co-operation.|$|E
