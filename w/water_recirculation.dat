On-demand recirculating pumps are activated by push-button or other sensor. A water contacting temperature probe installed at the hot water usage point signals the pump to stop.

40|$|Microalgae {{are highly}} {{efficient}} primary producers {{that can be}} grown in most types of water on non-arable land as a promising source of biofuel. However, large-scale microalgal biofuel production is currently uneconomical due to slow growth of high-percentage oleaginous algae and large harvesting costs. Here we present a new strategy, using a small dose of externally applied UV-C radiation, that significantly increases lipid contents of fast growing microalgae and that at higher doses also results in rapid settling. The procedure essentially separates biomass growth from lipid accumulation and harvesting which was tested in several microalgal strains and optimized to be completed within 48 h for Tetraselmis sp. using pilot-scale outdoor cultivation. This process resulted in a significant increase of both volumetric and areal lipid productivity with higher polyunsaturated fatty acid contents, while considerably reducing harvesting costs.

40|$|AbstractThe {{biological}} filter capable of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification was constructed for aquatic animal {{experiments in the}} International Space Station (ISS). The {{biological filter}} {{will be used to}} remove harmful ammonia excreted from aquatic animals in a closed water circulation system (Aquatic Habitat). The biological filter is a cylindrical tank packed with porous glass beads for nitrification and dual plastic bags for denitrification. The porous beads are supporting media for Nitrosomonas europaea and Nitrobacter winogradskyi. The N. europaea cells and N. winogradskyi cells on the porous beads, oxidize the excreted ammonia to nitrate via nitrite. On the other hand, the dual bag is composed of an outer non-woven fabric bag and an inner non-porous polyethylene film bag. The outer bag is supporting media for Paracoccus pantotrophus. The inner bag, in which 99. 5 % ethanol is packed, releases the ethanol slowly, since ethanol can permeate through the non-porous polyethylene film. The P. pantotrophus cells on the outer bag reduce the produced nitrate to nitrogen gas by using the released ethanol as an electron donor for denitrification. The biological filter constructed in this study consequently removed the ammonia without accumulating nitrate. Most of the excess ethanol was consumed and did not affect the nitrification activity of the N. europaea cells and N. winogradskyi cells severely. In accordance with the aquatic animal experiments in the ISS, small freshwater fish had been bred in the closed water circulation system equipped with the biological filter for 90 days. Ammonia concentration daily excreted from fish is assumed to be 1. 7 mg-N/L in the <b>recirculation</b> <b>water.</b> Under such conditions, the harmful ammonia and nitrite concentrations were kept below 0. 1 mg-N/L in the <b>recirculation</b> <b>water.</b> Nitrate and total organic carbon concentrations in the <b>recirculation</b> <b>water</b> were kept below 5 mg-N/L and 3 mg-C/L, respectively. All breeding fish were alive and ate the feed well.

40|$|At {{the end of}} April 1990, a <b>recirculation</b> <b>water</b> {{purification}} plant was taken into operation to close the in-house water cycle at Kartonfabrik Rieger GmbH and Co. KG. The <b>recirculation</b> <b>water</b> {{purification plant}} consists of two series-connected pulp catchers and a flotation unit at the primary treatment stage, and a flotation-filtration pulp catcher at the secondary treatment stage. The clear water generated at primary treatment has a solids content of 240 mg/l, while the super-clear water produced at secondary treatment has a solids content of 10 - 30 mg/l and is deployed instead of fresh water. About 6, 5 l wastewater/kg paper is achieved. In late 1991 a biological high-intensity unit that works according to the HCR (high-performance-compact-reactor) process was taken into operation for final biological treatment of the wastewater resulting from production. The {{central part of the}} plant consists of binary jets located in the loop reactors; these jets serve to disperse bacterial floc into fine agglomerates {{on the basis of the}} turbulence caused and the shear force. This prevents the development of chlamydobacteriales and thus the formation of bulking sludge.

A two-dimensional hydrogeological model was developed to simulate SGD from a coastal unconfined aquifer in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, where previous SGD studies were performed. A density-variable numerical code, SEAWAT 2000, was applied to simulate SGD. To accurately predict discharge, various influencing factors such as heterogeneity in conductivity, uncertain boundary conditions, and tidal pumping were systematically assessed.
