The combustion head contains the inlet and exhaust valves, the ignition source and withstands {{the pressure of the}} combustion chamber. Water enters the pump through sprung inlet valves below the combustion chamber. A distinctive feature of the Humphrey pump, compared to others, is that the water only has to flow through this single set of valves: there are no non-return outlet valves, only the inertia of the delivered <b>water</b> within the <b>outlet</b> <b>pipe</b> is used to control its flow.

40|$|This article {{presents}} findings {{from a study}} carried out in Keko Machungwa informal settlement in Dar es Salaam {{under the auspices of}} the Disaster Management Training Centre of Ardhi University, Tanzania. The settlement has experienced frequent flooding in the past five years, and this study explores the causes, risks, extent of flooding and coping strategies of residents as well as municipality and city officials. Key methods employed in capturing empirical evidence included mapping of zones by severity of flooding, interviews with households, subward leaders, and municipal and city officials. Non-participant observation, primarily taking photographs, complemented these methods. Laboratory tests of water samples taken from shallow wells in the settlement were performed to establish the level of pollution. In addition, records of prevalence of water-borne diseases were gathered from a dispensary within the settlement to corroborate flooding events, water pollution and occurrence of such diseases. Findings show that flooding is contributed to by the lack of a coordinated stormwater drainage system; haphazard housing development within the valley; and blocking of the water stream by haphazard dumping of solid waste and construction. Risks associated with flooding include water and air pollution, diseases, waterlogging and blocked accessibility. The most common coping strategies at household level are use of sandbags and tree logs; raised pit latrines and doorsteps; provision of <b>water</b> <b>outlet</b> <b>pipes</b> above plinth level; construction of embankments, protection walls and elevation of house foundations; seasonal displacement; and boiling and chemical treatment of water.

40|$|The bearing {{capacity}} and service {{life of a}} pavement is affected adversely {{by the presence of}} undrained water in the pavement layers. In cold winter climates like in Iowa, this problem is magnified further by the risk of frost damage when water is present. Therefore, well-performing subsurface drainage systems form an important aspect of pavement design by the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT). However, controversial findings are also reported in the literature regarding the benefits of subsurface drainage. The goal of this research was not to investigate whether subdrains are needed in Iowa pavements, but to conduct an extensive performance review of primary interstate pavement subdrains in Iowa, determine the cause of the problem if there are drains that are not functioning properly, and investigate the effect of poor subdrain performance due to improper design, construction, and maintenance on pavement surface distresses, if any. An extensive literature review was performed covering national-level and state-level research studies mainly focusing on the effects of subsurface drainage on performance of asphalt and concrete pavements. Several studies concerning the effects of a recycled portland cement concrete (RPCC) subbase on PCC pavement drainage systems were also reviewed. A detailed forensic test plan was developed in consultation with the project technical advisory committee (TAC) for inspecting and evaluating the Iowa pavement subdrains. Field investigations were conducted on 64 selected (jointed plain concrete pavement/JPCP and hot-mix asphalt/HMA) pavement sites during the fall season of 2012 and were mainly focused on the drainage outlet conditions. Statistical analysis was conducted on the compiled data from field investigations to further investigate the effect of drainage on pavement performance. Most Iowa subsurface drainage system outlet blockage is due to tufa, sediment, and soil. Although higher blockage rates reduce the flow rate of <b>water</b> inside <b>outlet</b> <b>pipes,</b> it does not always stop water flowing from inside the <b>outlet</b> <b>pipe</b> to outside the <b>outlet</b> <b>pipe</b> unless the <b>outlet</b> is completely blocked. Few pavement surface distresses were observed near blocked subsurface drainage outlet spots. More shoulder distresses (shoulder drop or cracking) were observed near blocked drainage outlet spots compared to open ones. Both field observations and limited performance analysis indicate that drainage outlet conditions do not {{have a significant effect on}} pavement performance. The use of RPCC subbase in PCC pavements results in tufa formation, a primary cause of drainage outlet blockage in JPCP. Several useful recommendations to potentially improve Iowa subdrain performance, which warrant detailed field investigations, were mad...|$|R

40|$|The {{self-priming}} {{process of}} self-priming pump is gas-liquid two-phase flow process with complex internal transient flow. The effect of gas-liquid mixing and separating performances {{will play a}} crucial role during self-priming process. In order to study the self-priming process and improve the self-priming performance, the model named JETST- 100 was selected. Based on Eulerian-Eulerian multiphase flow model, transient numerical simulation of the gas-liquid mixing and separating phenomena on the pump chamber was carried out by using CFX software. The distributions of velocity vector, contours of gas volume fraction and liquid velocity of the pump or jet aerator, and the change of the gas volume fraction by monitoring points on the jet aerator were obtained. Test and simulation results show that the gas-liquid two-phase flow from the guide vane will form a larger velocity circulation, so that the gas-liquid separation is not sufficient. And the volume fraction of liquid inside pump chamber decrease with a large amount of <b>water</b> enters the <b>outlet</b> <b>pipe.</b> It is found that adding the baffle plate can prevent the generation of circulation on guide vane back, the gas-phase volume fraction of jet aerator inlet and nozzle outlet decreases, improve the self-priming performance of the pump...|$|R

In comparison with the conventional U-tube GHE, the performance of spiral-tube GHE increases by 62. 7 % in the laminar flow and by 33. 5 % in the turbulent flow. Due to the interest in applying the GHE in concrete foundation piles, the spiral-tube GHE installed in a concrete pile is also simulated. Its performance shows a slight better performance of 5 % in the laminar flow and 6 % in the turbulent flow compared with that of a borehole backfilled with silica sand.

During a gasstand test the turbocharger is connected in a test bench, it is connected with pipes on both the compressor and turbine side, to simulate the hot exhaust gases from the car engine and the pressure increase over the compressor.

In present day farming energy and agronomic efficiencies are both important factors. As the working-width of implements has increased, air-seeding is the best solution for the sowing of cereal crops. One of the problematic areas is {{the design of the}} air-delivery system, particularly if the pneumatic conveying system is wrongly dimensioned. The flow of seeding material during conveying must be high and regular enough for a high-speed seeding. There are three parameters that ensure the conveying of seeding material in a pipe: air velocity, flow concentration and pipe diameter.
