However, consultation with our colleagues, Thomas Jordan and John Orcutt on board Melville, indicated that coring near the ocean bottom seismometer (OBS) array around Hole 595 B could alter the programmed signal to noise ratio above which teleseisms trigger recording in the OBSs. They requested that we core no closer than about 8 km from three OBSs nearest Hole 595 B, and selected a target for us about that distance to the west. Since a new beacon was required at this distance, a new site number, 596, was designated. Briefly, <b>we</b> <b>planned</b> to obtain oriented hydraulic piston cores to the top of the cherts, then core through the cherts using the extended core barrel (XCB) to basement.

In the letter they stated that [...] "he Committee is interested in hearing from you [...] and FBI Director Robert F.

[...] Only 28 questions were answered publicly, with 7 answered under separate cover to the Committee. Meanwhile, organisations such as the ACLU, the EFF and EPIC had not stopped opposing the most controversial parts of the Act. Three months after the official response to the Select Committee on the Judiciary, EPIC filed a Freedom of Information (FOI) request seeking the information that was not released by the U.S. Department of Justice. While the Department of Justice released a number of records in response to the request, they didn't release all the material, asserting that certain responsive records were exempt from disclosure. In order to gain access to these records, the ACLU and EPIC brought a civil action against the Department of Justice, and on November 26 U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle ordered the Department of Justice to complete its processing of the FOI request by January 15, 2003.|$|E

40|$|Extent: 20 p.

There is currently no consensus as to the regimen to use {{in terms of the}} dose, duration, the use of repeat dosing and timing. Objectives: To assess the comparative effectiveness and adverse effects of different magnesium sulphate regimens for neuroprotection of the fetus in women considered at risk of preterm birth. Search methods:We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register (31 December 2011). Selection criteria:Randomised trials comparing different magnesium sulphate regimens when used for neuroprotection of the fetus in women considered at risk of preterm birth. <b>We</b> <b>planned</b> to include cluster trials. <b>We</b> <b>planned</b> to exclude quasi-randomised trials and those with a crossover design. <b>We</b> <b>planned</b> to include trials published as full-text papers, along with those published in abstract form only.

Authors’ conclusions: Although strong evidence supports the use of antenatal magnesium sulphate for neuroprotection of the fetus prior to very preterm birth, no trials comparing different treatment regimens have been completed. Research should be directed towards comparisons of different dosages and other variations in regimens, evaluating both maternal and infant outcomes.
