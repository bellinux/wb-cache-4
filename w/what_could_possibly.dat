25|$|A third-millennium BC earthen goblet {{discovered}} at the Burnt City, a Bronze Age urban settlement in southeastern Iran, depicts <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> be the world's oldest example of animation. The artifact, associated with Jiroft, bears five sequential images depicting a wild goat jumping up {{to eat the}} leaves of a tree. The earliest attested Iranian examples of visual representations, however, are {{traced back to the}} bas-reliefs of Persepolis, the ritual center of the Achaemenid Empire. The figures at Persepolis remain bound by the rules of grammar and syntax of visual language. The Iranian visual arts reached a pinnacle by the Sasanian era, and several works from this period have been found to articulate movements and actions in a highly sophisticated manner. It is even possible to see a progenitor of the cinematic close-up shot in one of these works of art, which shows a wounded wild pig escaping from the hunting ground.|$|E

500|$|Five {{days before}} the first PS2 release for Kanon, a PS2 printer called Tapis MPR-505 went on sale which enabled the user to print out game screens. Kanon {{was one of the}} three games {{supported}} at launch, the other two being America Ōden Ultra Quiz from DigiCube and Marle de Jigsaw from Nippon Ichi Software. The first PS2 release in 2002 was reviewed by the Japanese video game magazine Famitsu where the game received an overall score of 29/40 (out of the four individual review scores of 7, 8, 7, and 7). Yūichi Suzumoto commented in an interview in March 2001 that he felt the end of Kanons story could be summed up as [...] "the prince and princess live happily ever after. The end," [...] resulting in an ending that does not expand on <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> happen afterwards. In the October 2007 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, poll results for the 50 best bishōjo games were released. Out of 249 titles, Kanon ranked fifth with 71 votes.|$|E
500|$|Despite his contributions, his {{captaincy}} {{and coaching}} methods came under immense scrutiny {{from the press}} {{as well as other}} scholars. Engel commented that [...] "He seems like aloof to the problems that his mal-decisions are creating. I don't particularly believe that Ganguly has an 'effing knowledge how to lead his team and tries to counter-pose it with instigating limitless, confrontational behaviours within the younger members of it. [...] the time will come when such shock tactics will cease to work." [...] An article on Cricinfo Magazine pointed out his reckless behaviour. The reporter Rahul Bhattacharya said, [...] "Generally Ganguly fostered angry or reckless young men. To him 'good behaviour', a broad term espoused by the present team management, belonged in school and probably not even there. He himself had been summoned to the match referee no less than 12 times in the last decade. His approach was bound to precipitate <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> be termed a cultural conflict in the world of modern sport. For Ganguly, like for Arjuna Ranatunga, competitiveness involved brinksmanship rather than training. As far as they were concerned Australia were not to be aspired to. They were simply to be toppled. England were not to be appeased. Victory lay precisely in their disapproval. In other words, Ganguly and Ranatunga wanted to do things their way." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{a hybrid}} {{scientific}} discipline, evolutionary physiology provides some unique perspectives. [...] For example, {{an understanding of}} physiological mechanisms can help in determining whether a particular pattern of phenotypic variation or covariation (such as an allometric relationship) represents <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> exist or just what selection has allowed. [...] Similarly, a thorough knowledge of physiological mechanisms can greatly enhance understanding of possible reasons for evolutionary correlations and constraints than is possible {{for many of the}} traits typically studied by evolutionary biologists (such as morphology).|$|E
2500|$|Sullivan {{endorsed}} Senator Barack Obama for the Democratic {{nomination in}} the 2008 United States presidential election, and Representative Ron Paul for the Republican nomination. He eventually endorsed Obama for president, largely {{because he believed}} that he would restore [...] "the {{rule of law and}} Constitutional balance"; he also argued that Obama represented a more realistic prospect for [...] "bringing America back to fiscal reason", and expressed a hope that Obama would be able to [...] "get us past the culture war." [...] Sullivan has continued to maintain that Obama is the best choice for president from a conservative point of view. During the 2012 election campaign, he wrote, [...] "Against a radical right, reckless, populist insurgency, Obama is the conservative option, dealing with emergent problems with pragmatic calm and modest innovation. He seeks as a good Oakeshottian would to reform the country's policies in order to regain the country's past virtues. <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> be more conservative than that?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Page {{recorded}} with many notable musicians, {{many of these}} early tracks are only available as bootleg recordings, several of which were released by the Led Zeppelin fan club in the late 1970s. One of the rarest {{of these is the}} early jam session featuring Jimmy Page and Stones guitarist Keith Richards covering Robert Johnson's [...] "Little Queen of Spades". Several early tracks with Page were compiled on the twin album release, [...] Page also {{recorded with}} Richards on guitar and vocals in Olympic Sound Studios on 15 October 1974. Along with Ric Grech on bass and Bruce Rowland on drums, a track called [...] "Scarlet" [...] was cut. Page reflected later in an interview with Rolling Stones Cameron Crowe: [...] "I did <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> be the next Stones B side. It was Ric Grech, Keith and me doing a number called [...] "Scarlet." [...] I can't remember the drummer. It sounded very similar in style and mood to those Blonde on Blonde tracks. It was great, really good. We stayed up all night and went down to Island Studios where Keith put some reggae guitars over one section. I just put some solos on it, but it was eight in the morning of the next day before I did that. He took the tapes to Switzerland and someone found out about them. Keith told people that it was a track from my album".|$|E

2500|$|Hawaii's {{very high}} cost of living {{is the result of}} several {{interwoven}} factors of the global economy in addition to domestic U.S. government trade policy. Like other regions with desirable weather throughout the year, such as areas of California, Arizona and Florida, Hawaii's residents can be considered to be subject to a [...] "Sunshine tax". This situation is further exacerbated by the natural factors of geography and world distribution that lead to higher prices for goods due to increased shipping costs, a problem which many island states and territories suffer from as well. The situation is compounded even further by <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>possibly</b> be the single largest contributor to the high costs of living in Hawaii, a U.S. trade law known as the Jones Act, or the Merchant Marine Act of 1920. This trade regulation prohibits any foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between two American ports—a practice known as cabotage. Most consumer goods in the United States are manufactured by outsourced labor in East Asia, then transported by container ships to ports on the U.S. mainland, and Hawaii also receives the same goods. Being located in the central Pacific Ocean, right between major Pacific shipping lanes, it would be very economical to unload Hawaiian-bound goods in Honolulu, before continuing on to the mainland. However, this would effectively make the second leg of the voyage between Hawaii and the mainland a domestic route between two American ports. Because most large cargo ships operate under foreign [...] "flags of convenience" [...] such as Liberia, Vanuatu or Papua New Guinea, allowing them to avoid the more stringent, and thus more costly, regulations of developed nations' ports, the domestic leg of the voyage would be disallowed by the Jones Act. Instead, those cargo ships must proceed directly to the West Coast, where distributors break bulk and transport the Hawaiian-bound, Asian-manufactured goods back across the ocean by U.S.-flagged ships and increasing the length of the voyage by more than 50%. This highly inefficient system of shipping Hawaii's consumer cargo comes at a very hefty price for the average Hawaiian citizen, and makes the cost of living in Hawaii much, much higher than it would otherwise be.|$|E
