5|$|Sanctions against FR Yugoslavia <b>were</b> <b>lifted</b> in January 2001.

5|$|Brewing at home {{is subject}} to {{regulation}} and prohibition in many countries. Restrictions on homebrewing <b>were</b> <b>lifted</b> in the UK in 1963, Australia followed suit in 1972, and the US in 1978, though individual states were allowed to pass their own laws limiting production.|$|E
5|$|The War Department requisitioned {{the rails}} during the First World War and they <b>were</b> <b>lifted</b> for scrap in 1917. A {{majority}} of the railway company board proposed seeking an abandonment order at once, but a rival Board was established; they continued to receive the Ebbw Vale Company's contracted lease payments until the lease expired in 1919.|$|E
5|$|The {{line was}} finally closed to freight traffic in 1967, {{after which the}} tracks <b>were</b> <b>lifted.</b> Part of the {{trackbed}} is now used by the Milton Keynes redway system, the network of cycle and pedestrian routes that serves the Milton Keynes urban area.|$|E

50|$|There is {{evidence}} that meltwater discharges are episodic. This can result because as water continues to collect, more ice <b>is</b> <b>lifted,</b> and the water moves outward in a growing under-ice lake. Areas where the ice <b>is</b> most easily <b>lifted</b> (i.e., areas with thinner overlying ice sheets) <b>are</b> <b>lifted</b> first. Hence the water may move up the terrain underlying the glacier if it moves toward areas of lower overlying ice. As water collects, additional ice <b>is</b> <b>lifted</b> until a release path is created.|$|R
5000|$|After the {{expansion}} draft, the trade limitation of allocated-for-same-country-allocated <b>was</b> <b>lifted.</b> [...] Players that were 'unevenly' traded once this restriction <b>was</b> <b>lifted</b> include Amy LePeilbet (to Kansas City), Karina LeBlanc (to Chicago), and Veronica Perez (to Washington).|$|R
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued {{in response to}} Isaac on October 1 for the Avalon Peninsula. The watch was upgraded to a {{tropical storm}} warning the next day, while a separate watch was posted for the Burin and Bonavista peninsulas, though it was quickly discontinued. By 2100 UTC on October 2, all tropical cyclone watches and warnings <b>were</b> <b>lifted.</b> Heavy rainfall and gusty winds were expected, prompting the issuance of rainfall warnings for parts of southeastern Newfoundland, while wind and gale advisories were declared offshore.|$|E
5|$|Burger's Daughter is a {{political}} and historical novel by the South African Nobel Prize in Literature-winner Nadine Gordimer, first published in the United Kingdom in June 1979 by Jonathan Cape. The book {{was expected to be}} banned in South Africa, and a month after publication in London the import and sale of the book in South Africa was prohibited by the Publications Control Board. Three months later, the Publications Appeal Board overturned the banning and the restrictions <b>were</b> <b>lifted.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, this winding route {{proved to}} be too {{dangerous}} and difficult for the explosion of vehicle traffic that occurred after World War II. Alvinston was originally reliant on the Canada Southern Railroad, which {{was taken over by}} the Michigan Central Railway and that by New York Central. However, by 1960 the use of the rails had declined so much that service was stopped. The tracks <b>were</b> <b>lifted</b> two years later.|$|E

50|$|If meltwater accumulates, the {{discharges}} are episodic under continental ice sheets as well {{as under}} Alpine glaciers. The discharge results when water collects, the overlying ice <b>is</b> <b>lifted,</b> and the water moves outward in a pressurized layer or a growing under-ice lake. Areas where the ice <b>is</b> most easily <b>lifted</b> (i.e. areas with thinner overlying ice sheets) <b>are</b> <b>lifted</b> first. Hence the water may move up the terrain underlying the glacier if it moves toward areas of lower overlying ice. As water collects, additional ice <b>is</b> <b>lifted</b> until a release path is created.|$|R

5|$|In Oaxaca, 42municipalities were {{declared}} disaster areas. Throughout {{the state}} of Guerrero, 56 municipalities were declared a disaster area while 9 municipalities in Michoacán were declared a disaster zone. In all, 428municipalities were designated as disaster areas and 155emergencies declarations were issued due to both Ingrid and Manuel. State of emergencies were declared in Michoacan and 21 municipalities in Jalisco, though by mid-October, they <b>were</b> <b>lifted.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lady Denman Drive, a roadway {{atop the}} dam wall, {{provides}} a third road crossing for the lake. It {{consists of a}} roadway and a bicycle path, and allows residents in western Canberra to cross the lake. This was possible because the dam gates are closed by pushing up from below, unlike most previous designs that wherein the gates <b>were</b> <b>lifted</b> from above.|$|E
5|$|On October 12, a {{hurricane}} watch was issued for the coast from Culiacán to Manzanillo and the Baja California Peninsula south of latitude 24°N. At the same time, {{a tropical storm}} warning was issued from Manzanillo to Tepic.

5|$|The service {{modifications}} lowered operating expenses, but {{the coefficient}} of use went down dramatically: 0.33 for the first ten months of 1908. The decision to axe the line was made on 1 November 1908. Two strategic errors had been made: wanting a service independent of the CTR's network, and putting its terminus out of town. The railway was officially disbanded by a decree of 14 September 1911, the rails <b>were</b> <b>lifted,</b> the public highway restored; {{no trace of the}} tramway remains.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{designated}} Tropical Disturbance 06F, {{tropical cyclone}} alerts and strong wind warnings were issued for Niue, Tonga, the Cook Islands, and French Polynesia. A flood advisory and small craft advisory were issued for Samoa. Later that day, the strong wind warnings for the Cook Islands and French Polynesia were canceled, as Urmil no longer posed {{a threat to}} the islands. By January15, all of the warnings associated with Urmil <b>were</b> <b>lifted.</b>|$|E
5|$|A new mineral venture was {{attempted}} in 1907, {{for which}} {{much of the}} line was re-opened and a -gauge extension was added, but this failed and the line closed again in 1910. A section of the track {{was used to test}} and demonstrate an automatic signal warning device in 1911 and occasionally used in that connection up to 1914. The tracks <b>were</b> <b>lifted</b> for scrap in 1917, after which a light railway was laid on part of the trackbed in 1918 to carry timber. This ended in 1920 and the company was wound up in 1925.|$|E

5|$|In June 2010, {{one of the}} TBMs {{completed}} its tunnel at the cavern. The second TBM broke through {{the wall of the}} cavern on July 15, 2010, completing its tunneling operation. The TBMs were partially disassembled and backed up to the 25th Street shaft, where they <b>were</b> <b>lifted</b> out. In April 2011, the MTA announced that the contract covering the tunnels, the 34th Street station mezzanine and passenger platform was 85% complete, and that the systems contract, covering mechanical and electrical systems, electric power, lighting and train tracks would be awarded by July 2011. A second entrance to the station is planned. In May 2012, the MTA announced that the extension, now 65% complete, had received the installation of the first set of rails.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to {{stabilize}} the situation, the Icelandic government stated that all domestic deposits in Icelandic banks would be guaranteed, imposed strict capital controls to stabilize {{the value of the}} Icelandic króna, and secured a US$5.1bn sovereign debt package from the IMF and the Nordic countries in order to finance a budget deficit and the restoration of the banking system. The international bailout support programme led by IMF officially ended on 31 August 2011, while the capital controls which were imposed in November 2008 <b>were</b> <b>lifted</b> on 14 March 2017.|$|E
5|$|New backup oxygen {{generators}} and filters have been {{installed on the}} aircraft. The coughing symptoms {{have been attributed to}} acceleration atelectasis ("collapse or closure of a lung resulting in reduced or absent gas exchange"), which may be exacerbated by the F-22's high performance. The presence of toxins and particles in some ground crew was deemed to be unrelated. On 4 April 2013, the distance and altitude flight restrictions <b>were</b> <b>lifted</b> after the F-22 Combined Test Force and 412th Aerospace Medicine Squadron determined that breathing restrictions on the pilot were responsible as opposed to an issue with the oxygen provided.|$|E
50|$|Although laid as double track, {{one line}} <b>was</b> <b>lifted</b> in 1916 to provide {{materials}} {{for use in}} France.
