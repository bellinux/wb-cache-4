Autonomy provided that the head of government would be an ethnic Tibetan; however, actual power in the TAR is held by the First Secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Regional Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> a Tibetan. The role of ethnic Tibetans in the higher levels of the TAR Communist Party remains very limited.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the early}} 20th century, most modern works feature Morgan as a sorceress and {{sometimes}} a priestess, and usually a half-sister of Arthur {{and sometimes a}} femme fatale, but some also have her in other roles, including as a fairy or an otherwise non-human character. Many authors effectively merge Morgan with Morgause (traditionally a sister of Morgan {{and the mother of}} both Mordred and Gawain) and combine her with the less savory aspects of the Lady of the Lake (this is further positioning a modern Morgan as a nemesis for Merlin, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> truly her foe in the medieval Arthurian lore); such a composite character is then often turned into Mordred's mother or partner.|$|E

The Inspector was convinced a vagrant named Mr. Bones had killed Amy, but was unable to prove it, and so planted evidence. However, the local newspaper discovered his ruse, and the case against Bones fell apart. He was released, and Amy's trail went cold. Her parents subsequently blamed The Inspector for the police's failure to find her, and he was fired. Now, on the fifth anniversary of her disappearance, he has come to the abandoned ruins of Dowerton train station and hotel after local children reported seeing Amy in the vicinity.|$|E

Dana Phillips writes: [...] "Tarantino's film is immensely entertaining, not despite {{but because it is}} so very audacious—even, at times, downright lurid, thanks to its treatment of slavery, race relations, and that staple of the Western, violence. No doubt these are matters that another director would have handled more delicately, and with less stylistic excess, than Tarantino, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> bashful. Another director also would have been less willing to proclaim his film the first in a new genre, the 'Southern'." ...|$|E

Nolan delivers another true original: welcome to an undiscovered country." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B+ rating and Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote, [...] "It's a rolling explosion of images as hypnotizing and sharply angled as any in a drawing by M. C. Escher or a state-of-the-biz video game; the backwards splicing of Nolan's own Memento looks rudimentary by comparison." [...] The New York Post gave the film a four-star rating and Lou Lumenick wrote, [...] "DiCaprio, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> better as the tortured hero, draws you in with a love story that will appeal even to non-sci-fi fans." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film a full four stars and said that Inception [...] "is all about process, about fighting our way through enveloping sheets of reality and dream, reality within dreams, dreams without reality. It's a breathtaking juggling act." [...] Richard Roeper, also of the Sun-Times, gave Inception a perfect score of [...] "A+" [...] and called it [...] "one of the best movies of the [...] century." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Put Yourself in My Place" [...] was written, arranged, and {{produced}} by American musician and songwriter Jimmy Harry. The track was recorded at Whorga Musica Studios, Axis Studios and Power Station Studios in New York City by Doug Deangelis, {{who served as}} the engineer and mixer for Minogue's fifth and eponymous studio album (1994); it was the only entry from the parent album that was recorded away from Minogue's home in the United Kingdom. British author Sean Smith, who had written an biography detailing Minogue's career, noted that [...] "Put Yourself in My Place" [...] was one of the singer's most personal yet favourite tracks. Musically, it is a ballad-inspired recording that incorporates musical elements of trip hop and pop music, as described by writers Adrian Denning and Hunter Felt from PopMatters. Chris True of AllMusic described the song as [...] "slicker, more stylish, and less hooky than anything she had previously recorded." [...] According to the demo sheet music at Sheet Music Direct published by Music Sales Group, the song is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 78 beats per minute. During the opening sequence and first verse, it has a chord progression of F♭-F-F♭-F-F♭-F-F♭-F-F/A-F♭-F, and Minogue's vocals span from B♭3 to D5. Julie Aspinall stated that the lyrical content is [...] "about a woman <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> able to get over her ex-boyfriend".|$|E

2500|$|Nevertheless, many {{teachers}} of English still admonish students against using split infinitives in writing. Because the prohibition {{has become so}} widely known, the Columbia Guide recommends that writers [...] "follow the conservative path , especially when you're uncertain of your readers' expectations and sensitivities in this matter". Likewise, the Oxford Dictionaries do not regard the split infinitive as ungrammatical, but on balance consider it likely to produce a weak style and advise against its use for formal correspondence. [...] R. W. Burchfield's revision of Fowler's Modern English Usage goes farther (quoting Burchfield's own 1981 book The Spoken Word): [...] "Avoid splitting infinitives whenever possible, but do not suffer undue remorse if a split infinitive is unavoidable for {{the completion of a}} sentence already begun." [...] Still more strongly, the style guide of The Economist says, [...] "Happy the man <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> told that it is wrong to split an infinitive: the ban is pointless. Unfortunately, to see it broken is so annoying to so many people that you should observe it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Associated {{terms for}} {{pregnancy}} are gravid and parous. Gravidus and gravid {{come from the}} Latin for [...] "heavy" [...] and a pregnant female is {{sometimes referred to as}} a gravida. Gravidity is a term used to describe the number of times that a female has been pregnant. [...] Similarly, the term parity is used for the number of times that a female carries a pregnancy to a viable stage. Twins and other multiple births are counted as one pregnancy and birth. [...] A woman <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> pregnant is referred to as a nulligravida. [...] A woman who is (or has been only) pregnant for the first time is referred to as a primigravida, and a woman in subsequent pregnancies as a multigravida or as multiparous. Therefore, during a second pregnancy a woman would be described as gravida 2, para 1 and upon live delivery as gravida 2, para 2. [...] In-progress pregnancies, abortions, miscarriages and/ or stillbirths account for parity values being less than the gravida number. In the case of a multiple birth the gravida number and parity value are increased by one only. Women who have never carried a pregnancy achieving more than 20 weeks of gestation age are referred to as nulliparous.|$|E

2500|$|Wanda Dollard (Nancy Robertson) is {{a quirky}} cashier at Corner Gas, and the self-professed smartest person in town. She {{was born on}} April 16, 1968 (as shown on her driver's license in the episode [...] "The Accidental Cleanist"). Wanda has a sardonic, caustic {{personality}} and enjoys lording her knowledge over others. She is the single mother of a 6-year-old son, Tanner Vincent Dollard, <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> seen or heard on-screen. (It's implied that Hank is Tanner's father; when Wanda is approached about this, she tries to laugh it off, but doesn't deny it outright.) Tanner is portrayed as a living nightmare for prospective babysitters (Season 1, Episode 4) and is a handful for his own mother, doing things like putting peanut butter up her nose while she sleeps. Accused of being a know-it-all, Wanda {{is also one of}} very few Dog River residents who has gone to university; she holds a degree in linguistics with a minor in comparative religion but took classes in many other subjects. Despite her extensive education, she considers her job at Corner Gas a privilege. She is shown as having a case of mild agoraphobia in one episode. Like Brent and Hank, Wanda grew up in Dog River. After the end of the series, she pursued a Ph.D. in theoretical physics though she still works at Corner Gas, albeit with a pay raise.|$|E
2500|$|Jaci Stephen {{from the}} Daily Mail praised the casting of Essex in the role, saying, [...] "There {{is always a}} frisson of {{excitement}} when a big star joins a soap. [...] None, however, has excited {{me as much as}} the arrival of David Essex in EastEnders. It is inspired casting, not only because the part of Eddie Moon fits Essex like a glove, but because he brings a gravitas to the show. And those eyes. Goodness, those beautiful eyes." [...] Stephen went on to positively review Eddie's arrival, saying, [...] "It made for a great start to the week, with David Essex's exquisite comic timing bringing some light-hearted relief to the rather heavy Moon/Mitchell stuff of late." [...] Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror also positively reviewed Eddie's arrival in Albert Square, saying, [...] "Dressed in a smart, black three-piece whistle and flute [...] and a white button-down collar shirt, the dapper grey-haired man looks like he could have been a guest at a Big, Fat Gypsy Wedding. But within four minutes of arriving in Albert Square on Monday, he's been knocked over by Carol's car as he snatches Roxy's toddler Amy from its path. Although there have been reports that this newcomer has been banned from singing in the Vic, within 15 minutes he's croaking out a line from the Leyton Orient supporters' song. This is the grand entrance of former 70s teen idol David Essex" [...] Conversely, Jim Shelley, also from the Daily Mirror, criticised Eddie's arrival, saying, [...] "on Monday they blessed us with the arrival of Whispering David Essex as Eddie Moon, the latest example of the Long-Lost Relative <b>Who</b> <b>Has</b> <b>Never</b> <b>Been</b> Mentioned Before that is routine in soaps nowadays. [...] Eddie had been in EastEnders three whole minutes before the writers unleashed the bi-annual cliche of The Mean & Moody New Guy Saving A Child Running Out In Front Of A Car. [...] Eddie spent the week ticking off the components of that great EastEnders cliche, the 'rough diamond'/silver-tongued 'ladies' man.' (See also Dennis Watts, Michael Moon, Johnny Allen, Max & Jack Branning, Steve Owen et al.)" [...] A reporter from the Metro called the character [...] "mischievous", and another from the Evening Chronicle called him [...] "a pleasant, charming character", adding [...] "It seems as if a little bit of Essex will brighten up the East End for a while. [...] s far as I can tell, [...] will be {{a breath of fresh air}} in a soap that sometimes forgets to have a laugh." ...|$|E
