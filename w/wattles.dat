5|$|Immature red wattlebirds are {{generally}} less flamboyant. Juveniles have much less prominent <b>wattles,</b> brown irises, a pale crown {{and much less}} yellow on the belly. They moult into first immature plumage {{within a few months}} of leaving the nest. First immature birds are more similar to adults overall, having red irises with brown rings, <b>wattles</b> larger but still smaller than adults, and a greyish pink gape.|$|E
5|$|<b>Wattles</b> was vehemently {{opposed to}} unionization, and in 1909 fought strikes {{in favor of}} unionization with hired policemen and rampant violence. By 1934 the Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway Employees was {{organized}} in Omaha.|$|E
5|$|In the American Revolutionary War {{the tavern}} {{was run by}} Captain Alden. Around 1850, it was owned by Mr. <b>Wattles,</b> a {{descendant}} of Captain Alden. The tavern's last owner or date of destruction is unknown, but {{it was part of}} the town green by the 1903 publication of Butterworth's book, Brother Jonathan.|$|E
50|$|Common names include knife-leaf (or -leaved) <b>wattle,</b> golden glow <b>wattle,</b> {{half-moon}} <b>wattle</b> or dog-tooth <b>wattle.</b>|$|R
50|$|Other {{common names}} include Rhodesian blackwood, African blackwood, African <b>wattle,</b> African false <b>wattle,</b> Rhodesian <b>wattle</b> and Rhodesian black <b>wattle.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Common names include coast green <b>wattle,</b> black <b>wattle,</b> early black <b>wattle,</b> Sydney green <b>wattle,</b> queen <b>wattle,</b> and in {{the local}} Dharawal language, Boo'kerrikin. Maiden noted that was called Wat-tah by the {{indigenous}} people of Cumberland (Parramatta) and Camden districts. Sydney <b>wattle</b> was a name coined by von Mueller and early settlers around Penrith called it green <b>wattle.</b> Feathery <b>wattle</b> was another early name. It {{is also known as}} early green <b>wattle</b> in the Sydney basin, as it flowers in winter—earlier than similar species such as Parramatta <b>wattle</b> (Acacia parramattensis), blueskin (A. irrorata) and late black <b>wattle</b> (A. mearnsii). It has attracted the vernacular name [...] "green cancer" [...] in South Africa, where it has become weedy.|$|R
5|$|The Australian Coat of Arms {{includes}} a wreath of wattle; this does not, however, accurately represent a golden wattle. Similarly, {{the green and}} gold colours used by Australian international sporting teams were inspired by the colours of <b>wattles</b> in general, rather than the golden wattle specifically.|$|E
5|$|The {{cotingas}} are {{birds of}} forests or forest edges in tropical Central and South America. Comparatively {{little is known}} about this diverse group, although all have broad bills with hooked tips, rounded wings, and strong legs. The males of many of the species are brightly colored or decorated with plumes or <b>wattles.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1901 local {{businessman}} Gurdon W. <b>Wattles</b> consolidated {{several of}} the older horsecar and cable car companies to create the Omaha and Council Bluffs Streetcar Company, which later became the Omaha Traction Company. After receiving a 30-year franchise {{from the city of}} Omaha, the company established a mass transit system that covered the entire city, including commuter trains and interurbans.|$|E
5000|$|Acacia spectabilis, {{commonly}} known as Mudgee <b>wattle,</b> is an erect or spreading shrub, endemic to Australia. Alternative common names include glory <b>wattle,</b> Pilliga <b>wattle</b> and golden <b>wattle</b> ...|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} reserves, {{including}} Kauri Point Reserve down Moor Park, <b>Wattle</b> Farm Reserve on <b>Wattle</b> Farm Road and <b>Wattle</b> Farm Wetlands Reserve also on <b>Wattle</b> Farm Road.|$|R

5|$|In 1898, Omaha's leaders, {{under the}} {{guidance}} of Gurdon <b>Wattles,</b> held the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, touted as a celebration of agricultural and industrial growth throughout the Midwest. The Indian Congress, which drew more than 500 American Indians from across the country, was held simultaneously. More than 2 million visitors attended these events, located at Kountze Park and the Omaha Driving Park in the Kountze Place neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Like other <b>wattles,</b> Acacia pycnantha fixes {{nitrogen}} {{from the}} atmosphere. It hosts bacteria known as rhizobia that form root nodules, where they make nitrogen available in organic form and thus help the plant grow in poor soils. A field study across Australia and South Africa {{found that the}} microbes are genetically diverse, belonging to various strains of the species Bradyrhizobium japonicum and genus Burkholderia in both countries. It is unclear whether the golden wattle was accompanied by the bacteria to the African continent or encountered new populations there.|$|E
5|$|Silkies {{appear in}} two {{distinct}} varieties: bearded and non-bearded. Bearded Silkies {{have an extra}} muff of feathers under the beak area that covers the earlobes. They also are separated according to color. Colors of Silkie recognized for competitive showing include black, blue, buff, grey, partridge, and white. Alternative hues, such as cuckoo, lavender, red, and splash also exist. The standards of perfection call for all Silkies to have a small walnut-colored comb, dark <b>wattles,</b> and turquoise-blue earlobes. In addition to these defining characteristics, Silkies have five toes on each foot. Other breeds which exhibit this rare trait include the Dorking, Faverolles, and Sultan.|$|E
5|$|Common names {{recorded}} include golden <b>wattle,</b> green <b>wattle,</b> black <b>wattle,</b> and broad-leaved <b>wattle.</b> At Ebenezer Mission in the Wergaia {{country of}} north-western Victoria the aborigines {{referred to it}} as witch.|$|R
50|$|Acacia murrayana is {{a tree in}} {{the family}} Fabaceae. It has {{numerous}} common names, including sandplain <b>wattle,</b> Murray's <b>wattle,</b> fire <b>wattle,</b> colony <b>wattle</b> and powder bark <b>wattle.</b> It is widespread throughout Australia's arid zone, occurring on sand ridges and in disturbed areas in every mainland State except Victoria.|$|R
50|$|The southernmost {{species in}} the genus are Acacia dealbata (silver <b>wattle),</b> Acacia longifolia (coast <b>wattle</b> or Sydney golden <b>wattle),</b> Acacia mearnsii (black <b>wattle),</b> and Acacia melanoxylon (blackwood), {{reaching}} 43°30' S in Tasmania, Australia.|$|R
5|$|They live {{throughout}} rainforest, dry sclerophyll (Eucalyptus) forest, open woodland, Pandanus thickets, paperbarks, mangroves, watercourses, and wetter {{areas of}} semi-arid regions, {{as well as}} parks, gardens, and golf courses in urban areas. The understory in eucalypt-dominated woodland where the blue-faced honeyeater is found is most commonly composed of grasses such as Triodia, but sometimes it {{is made up of}} shrubs or small trees such as grevilleas, paperbarks, <b>wattles,</b> Cooktown ironwood (Erythrophleum chlorostachys) or billygoat plum (Terminalia ferdinandiana). One study in Kakadu National Park found that blue-faced honeyeaters inhabited mixed stands of eucalypts and Pandanus but were missing from pure stands of either plant.|$|E
5|$|Turkeys {{are large}} birds, their nearest {{relatives}} being the pheasant and the guineafowl. Males {{are larger than}} females and have spreading, fan-shaped tails and distinctive, fleshy <b>wattles,</b> called a snood, that hang {{from the top of}} the beak and are used in courtship display. Wild turkeys can fly, but seldom do so, preferring to run with a long, stratling gait. They roost in trees and forage on the ground, feeding on seeds, nuts, berries, grass, foliage, invertebrates, lizards, and small snakes.|$|E
5|$|From {{the twelfth}} century, burghs, towns that were granted certain legal {{privileges}} from the Crown, developed, {{particularly on the}} east coast with distinctive urban building patterns. They were typically surrounded by a palisade, and many had a castle. They usually had a market place, with a widened high street or junction, often marked by a mercat cross. There were houses for the nobles, burgesses and other significant inhabitants, which were often built in a relatively elaborate style {{and by the end of}} the period some would have slate roofs or tiles. Very little has survived of the houses of the urban poor. They were probably largely located in the backlands, away from the main street frontages. From Aberdeen and Perth there is evidence of nearly forty buildings dating from the twelfth to the fourteenth centuries, with walls of planks or <b>wattles.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1913, the {{national}} <b>Wattle</b> Day League {{was established to}} organise the celebration of <b>Wattle</b> Day. [...] In 1916, NSW changed its <b>Wattle</b> Day to 1 August so that Cootamundra <b>wattle</b> could be used.|$|R
50|$|Acacia beckleri, or Barrier Range <b>wattle,</b> is a {{plant in}} the genus Acacia native to Australasia, {{typically}} Australia. It is named after Dr Herman Beckler, the botanist on the Burke and Wills expedition in 1861 and who collected the type specimen. The common name refers to the Barrier Range in the Broken Hill area, western New South Wales. This species is similar to A. notabilis (notable <b>wattle,</b> Flinder's <b>wattle,</b> stiff golden <b>wattle)</b> and A. gladiformis (sword <b>wattle,</b> sword-leaf <b>wattle).</b>|$|R
50|$|Acacia difformis, {{commonly}} known as drooping <b>wattle,</b> Wyalong <b>wattle</b> or mystery <b>wattle,</b> is a shrub or small tree which is native to New South Wales.|$|R
5|$|From {{the twelfth}} century, burghs, towns that were granted certain legal {{privileges}} from the crown, developed, {{particularly on the}} east coast. They were typically surrounded by a palisade or had a castle and usually had a market place, with a widened high street or junction, often marked by a mercat cross, beside houses for the nobles, burgesses and other significant inhabitants, which were often built in a relatively elaborate style {{and by the end}} of the period some would have slate roofs or tiles. Very little has survived of the houses of the urban poor. They were probably largely located in the backlands, away from the main street frontages. From Aberdeen and Perth there is evidence of nearly forty buildings dating from the twelfth to the fourteenth centuries, with walls of planks or <b>wattles.</b>|$|E
5|$|Guinea fowl {{originated}} in southern Africa, and the species most often kept as poultry is the helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris). It is a medium-sized grey or speckled bird {{with a small}} naked head with colourful <b>wattles</b> and a knob on top, and was domesticated {{by the time of}} the ancient Greeks and Romans. Guinea fowl are hardy, sociable birds that subsist mainly on insects, but also consume grasses and seeds. They will keep a vegetable garden clear of pests and will eat the ticks that carry Lyme disease. They happily roost in trees and give a loud vocal warning of the approach of predators. Their flesh and eggs can be eaten in the same way as chickens, young birds being ready for the table at the age of about four months.|$|E
5|$|Telopea speciosissima is a pyrogenic-{{flowering}} species, {{relying on}} post-fire flowering followed by production and dispersal of non-dormant seeds {{to take advantage}} of favourable growing conditions in the altered environment following a fire. Of the woody resprouter species of southeastern Australia, {{it is one of the}} slowest to produce seedlings after bushfires, taking at least two years. The species resprouts from a lignotuber, a swollen woody base largely under the soil, that stores energy and nutrients as a resource for rapid growth of new shoots after a bushfire. Waratahs dominate the understorey around two years after a fire, but are later overtaken by the slower-growing banksias (Banksia) and <b>wattles</b> (Acacia). Fire also serves to strip away diseases and pests. Flowering may be prolific at this time.|$|E
50|$|Between 1840 and 1856 {{plantations}} {{of several}} non-native tree species {{were introduced to}} the area to satisfy the fuel-wood demand. These included four <b>wattle</b> species (black <b>wattle,</b> silver <b>wattle,</b> green <b>wattle</b> and blackwood), eucalyptus, cypress, Indian long leaf pine and thorny gorse. Eucalyptus became the preferred plantation tree.|$|R
50|$|<b>Wattle</b> Grove Lake is an {{artificial}} lake in suburb of <b>Wattle</b> Grove, Sydney, Australia. It was constructed by Delfin in 1990 {{along with the}} surrounding <b>Wattle</b> Grove residential development.|$|R
50|$|Acacia acinacea is a {{flowering}} shrub growing to 2m in height. It {{is native to}} Australia and lives for 15 years (on average). They are tolerant of drought and frost. It is also a species of <b>wattle,</b> and {{is commonly known as}} wreath <b>wattle,</b> gold dust <b>wattle</b> or round-leaf <b>wattle.</b>|$|R
5|$|Turquoise parrots are {{encountered}} in pairs or small groups consisting {{of parents and}} several offspring, though they may congregate into larger flocks of up to 75 predominantly juvenile birds outside the breeding season. As the breeding season nears, pairs separate out from these flocks. Turquoise parrots roost together communally in autumn and winter. At night they roost among the foliage of trees such as gums or <b>wattles,</b> anywhere from 1 to 8m (3–25ft) above the ground. They retreat to trees near their feeding areas during the day. The calls of the turquoise parrot have been little-studied; birds give a high-pitched soft contact call when feeding or in flight, while the alarm call {{has been described as}} a high-pitched zitting call. Turquoise parrots also chatter when settling to roost in the evening.|$|E
25|$|<b>Wattles</b> began {{training}} Dan Patch {{in earnest}} at a half-mile track (0.8 km) in Templeton in 1899. Before {{his first start}} in August 1900, Dan Patch impressed Messner and <b>Wattles</b> with a timed mile of 2:14, a promising performance for an unprompted horse who {{did not seem to}} be working hard. On August 30, they entered him at the Boswell county fair with a purse of $250 against 2:35 horses, meaning their fastest official time was no better than the next level of 2:20. Attendance at the fair that day exceeded 8,000, boosted by a large contingent from Oxford who wanted to see the local favorite. Dan Patch did not disappoint, winning in three straight heats in times of 2:24, 2:24 and 2:24. <b>Wattles</b> had not pushed the colt, wanting to be able to stay at the 2:35 level and perhaps to improve his odds in potential side bets in his upcoming races.|$|E
25|$|This switch {{was said}} to be due to a stream of losses {{stemming}} from the rapid decline of flat-panel TV prices, and possibly due to the strong call for Schoonover's removal from activist shareholder Mark <b>Wattles.</b>|$|E
