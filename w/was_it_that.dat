He stated in an {{interview}} that he began thinking of [...] "when <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> I felt I was really myself? And I remember it was when I put on my skates and my Eaton catalogues on my legs, and I stood up, and I was taller than my mom, and I had a stick in my hands, so I was stronger than my brother, and I felt that I was little me. So I started to write about that and it turned into the Hockey Sweater story." ...|$|E
500|$|Next {{to appear}} on the stand was Virtue Hall, who recounted much of her earlier {{statement}} to Fielding. [...] Squires again interrupted, asking [...] "What day <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> the young woman was robbed?" [...] The answer came back, from the court: [...] "She says {{on the morning of the}} 2nd of January", and Squires replied [...] "I return thanks for telling me, for I am as innocent as the child unborn". [...] Susannah Wells used the opportunity to ask how long Squires and her family were supposed to have been at the house, and was answered by Hall [...] "They were there six or seven weeks in all; they had been there about a fortnight before the young woman was brought in". [...] Amongst others, Thomas Colley and Mrs Canning also gave testimony. [...] Canning's former employer, John Wintlebury, told the court how he had deduced that it was Wells's house where Canning had been held. [...] Mary Myers and James Lord also claimed to have heard Canning say [...] "Wills or Wells", as did Robert Scarrat, a hartshorn-rasper and previously a servant in nearby Edmonton who had visited Wells's house on previous occasions.|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{concluding}} scene involving Sophia's {{death was}} {{cited as the}} episode highlight. Janet Turley of The Huffington Post asserted that the sequence was [...] "fiction not afraid to provoke", while Goldman described it as an [...] "absolutely horrific scenario". CNN's Henry Hanks opined that the sequence [...] "left [...] with a final scene that we'll be talking about until then." [...] New York City Starlee Kine asserted that it contained cinematic qualities, and felt that the scene was [...] "satisfying, sad, and fun". She wrote: [...] "It was everything you've ever wanted this show to be. Zombies plus no dialogue, such a winning combination! And how great <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> Sophia was dead instead of impossibly alive somewhere, holed up with Merle or Morgan or those warmhearted gang members in Atlanta. And because she was granted more screen time than she ever was when she was alive, we were finally able {{to care about the}} loss of her short, young life." [...] Jen Chaney of The Washington Post echoed synonymous sentiments; [...] "Really, the final moments of the last episode before the AMC series' December/January hiatus played like a fireworks finale on the Fourth of July, assuming your Fourth of July celebrations typically involve zombies and a pile of corpses." [...] Rawlings concluded that it was the perfect resolution for what he called [...] "television's slowest subplot". McIntyre felt that the concluding sequence was the most eventful moment of the episode, and stated that it was difficult to watch.|$|E

2500|$|The tour {{party were}} finally allowed {{to board the}} aircraft. According to Barrow, the {{harassment}} continued as they crossed the tarmac leading to the {{steps up to the}} plane. Some of the band's fans were also present; when they expressed sympathy for the Beatles, they too attracted scorn from the mob. McCartney recalled that, such was their relief once inside the cabin, [...] "We were all kissing the seats." [...] An announcement then called Epstein off the plane to finalise the unpaid tax demand. Barrow and Evans were also told to disembark. After their passport irregularities had been sorted out, they both re-boarded and the plane was able to take off. Lewis then got into a heated argument with Epstein regarding the concert takings. Epstein admonished Lewis for focusing on money, given the ordeal they had all just endured, and asked him: [...] "Who <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> screwed up the party invitation?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Many of the Mollies were {{miners and}} {{the mode of}} working the mines lent itself to their {{peculiar}} policy. Miners were paid by the cubic yard, by the mine car, or by the ton, and (in the driving of entries) by the lineal yard. In the assignment of places, which {{was made by the}} mining boss, there were [...] "soft" [...] jobs and hard. If a Molly applied for a soft job and was refused, his anger was aroused and not infrequently in due time the offending boss was murdered. If he got employment, there was a constant chance of disagreement in measuring-up the work and in estimating the quality of the coal mined, for it was the custom to dock the miners' wages for bad coal with too much slate and dirt, and a serious disagreement was apt to be followed by violence. Little wonder <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>that,</b> as the source of the outrages was well understood, mining bosses refused to employ Irishmen, but this did not ensure their safety, as they might then be murdered for their refusal. A good Superintendent of any colliery would, in his quality of superior officer, support an efficient mining boss and would thus fall under the ban himself. John T. Morse, Jr., who made a contemporaneous study of the Molly Maguires, wrote in his vivid account of their operations: [...] "The superintendents and 'bosses' in the collieries could all rest assured that their days would not be long in the land. Everywhere and at all times they were attacked, beaten, and shot down, by day and by night; month after month and year after year, on the public highways and in their own homes, in solitary places and in the neighborhood of crowds, these doomed men continued to fall in frightful succession beneath the hands of assassins." ...|$|E
