25|$|The final {{prediction}} of the male-assistance hypothesis {{has been extensively}} investigated. It predicts that females will exhibit differing mate preferences during fertile and non-fertile periods. Specifically, when fertile, the females will be sensitive to indicators of high genetic quality to increase the genetic quality of her offspring. Conversely, outside of the fertile period, females will show a preference for males <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> resources {{for her and her}} offspring. In most species, males of higher genetic quality offer fewer non-genetic resources (such as shelter and food) than those of lower quality, so females are likely to choose different males at each stage.|$|E

In 1998, it was announced that the competition would be changed to the International Mister Bootblack Competition and that a separate competition solely for women would be held at International Ms. Leather. This change was made largely because it was commonly held that women had a significant disadvantage competing for ballots from the mostly gay male IML attendees, who often base their bootblack selection at least partly on their sexual attraction to the bootblack. Since 1999, competitors for IMrBB are restricted to persons over the age of 21 <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> a valid government-issued form of identification that identifies them as male.|$|E

40|$|The aim {{of making}} {{selection}} in volleyball {{is to determine}} on a precise basis rate of selectivity {{as a starting point}} to gain successful involvement of young population in training, which can greatly help them in a subsequent stage to “clear their way” for high sports achievements.

The test results obtained from the random sampling showed that for 12, 16 % of the female volleyball players ultimate height of above 185 cm is expected what is advantageous for achieving good sports development and high rank competions; 32, 43 % of them are expected to reach height levels between 175 and 185 cm what is promising for improving their personal abilities in medium-rank team competitions, while the remaining 55, 41 % are expected to reach ultimate height less than 175 cm what may seriously restrain them in proper physical development or out playing in volleyball games...|$|R
25|$|One may {{reasonably}} {{maintain an}} average and acceptable temperature for the snake {{by the use}} of a heating element or infrared light bulbs. A gradient must be offered within the enclosure to allow the snake to bask in the heat or go to cooler areas in the tank. Optimum humidity can be difficult to maintain and research must be done on the snake to determine the correct level. More than 80% humidity must be maintained for caging an anaconda species from the tropical region, while a slightly less than 30% humidity must be maintained for a species of a desert region. Photoperiods are often used with most species of snake; natural light is best for this, but low UV percentage bulbs can also be used. Captive anacondas have a reputation for unpredictability and aggression due to the temperaments of wild-caught specimens first collected for captive breeding, but with proper care, green anacondas can and do make for calm, relatively sedate pets. Due to their immense size and power however, proper respect and caution should always be maintained, and they are best left to experienced adult owners <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> them with the proper requirements.|$|E
25|$|Girls {{are most}} likely to enjoy high {{self-esteem}} when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> social and moral support. When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low self-esteem. In contrast, boys are more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relation to authority. As such, {{they are more likely to}} derive high self-esteem from their ability to successfully influence their friends; on the other hand, the lack of romantic competence, for example, failure to win or maintain the affection of the opposite or same-sex (depending on sexual orientation), is the major contributor to low self-esteem in adolescent boys. Due to the fact that both men and women happen to have a low self-esteem after ending a romantic relationship, they are prone to other symptoms that is caused by this state. Depression and hopelessness are only two of the various symptoms and it is said that women are twice as likely to experience depression and men are three to four times more likely to commit suicide (Mearns, 1991; Ustun & Sartorius, 1995).|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Interactive Evolutionary Algorithms (IEAs) use human {{input to}} help drive a search process. Traditionally, IEAs allow {{the user to}} exhibit {{preferences}} among some set of individuals. Here we present {{a system in which}} the user directly demonstrates what he or she prefers. Demonstration has an advantage over preferences because the user <b>can</b> <b>provide</b> the system with a solution that would never have been presented to a user <b>who</b> <b>can</b> only <b>provide</b> preferences. However, demonstration exacerbates the user fatigue problem because it is more taxing than exhibiting preferences. The system compensates for this by retaining and reusing the user demonstration, similar in spirit to user modeling. The system is exercised on a robot locomotion and obstacle avoidance task that has an obvious local optimum. The user demonstration is provided through low-level control. The system is compared against a high-level fitness function that is susceptible to becoming trapped by a local optimum and a mid-level fitness function designed to remove the local optimum. We show that our proposed system outperforms most variants of these completely automatic methods, providing further evidence that Evolutionary Robotics (ER) can benefit by combining the intuitions of inexpert human users with the search capabilities of computers.

Urban planning in general, environmental planning in particular, and nature conservation and amenity planning most of all should demand a comprehensive, frequently updated set of relevant information. Much of this information needs to be given a spatial framework, including distributions and distributional interrelationships. In a word, the information needs to be mapped.
