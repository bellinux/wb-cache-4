6000|$|... "Yes, once. But I {{never told}} any of you, {{for fear of}} raising false hopes. I did apply, {{and it was all}} straight, but at the last moment the Department decided that I must have another <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> my identity, and this I could not get." ...|$|R

5000|$|Keyes, whose case relied totally on this <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> {{the alleged}} conspiracy, {{realized}} Wiseman-Sielaff was giving false testimony against Mrs. McPherson.

60|$|While this met {{fully with}} Bududreen's plans {{he urged the}} man against any such act {{that he might have}} <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that he not only had no hand in the crime, but had exerted his {{authority}} to prevent it; but when two of the men separated themselves from the party and crept toward the bungalow no force was interposed to stop them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you see, {{you have}} got nothing against him. He {{may have been a}} Knight of the Road for the last five years, but you have no <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> it, and it is not much use to accuse him of {{intending}} to rob the North mail. You have no proofs, even of that. It is only your word against his.|$|R
60|$|POTHINUS (desperately). Then I make a last {{appeal to}} Caesar's justice.

He had, at least, in Colonel McIntosh an unimpeachable <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> {{that he could not}} have {{committed}} that murder--and yet," [...] he added with slow, excited emphasis, marking each sentence with a knot, [...] "and yet he deliberately tries to throw the guilt upon a man who obviously was also innocent.

2500|$|In July 2005, the High Court {{ruled that}} the case should be reopened by the {{district}} court, allowing the defence <b>to</b> call new <b>witnesses.</b> The onus was on the defence team <b>to</b> call sufficient <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that Corby did not place the drugs in her bodyboard bag. One man was named {{as the owner of}} the drugs in Corby's bag. He was named as a key witness, but he said that he [...] "knows nothing".|$|R
60|$|Clarence denied {{all these}} {{charges in the}} most earnest and solemn manner. The king insisted upon the truth of them, and brought forward many <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> them. Of course, whether the charges were true or false, {{there could be no}} {{difficulty}} in finding plenty of <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> give the required testimony. The lords listened to the charges and the defense with a sort of solemn awe. Indeed, all England, as it were, stood by, silenced and appalled at the progress of this dreadful fraternal quarrel, and at the prospect of the terrible termination of it, which all could foresee must come.|$|R
5000|$|Buckley's autopsy {{showed no}} signs of drugs or alcohol in his system, and the death was ruled as an {{accidental}} drowning. The following statement was released from the Buckley estate: Jeff Buckley's death was not [...] "mysterious," [...] related to drugs, alcohol, or suicide. We have a police report, a medical examiner's report, and an eye <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that it was an accidental drowning, and that Mr. Buckley was in a good frame of mind prior to the accident.|$|R
60|$|Dugdale's {{talk was}} thought, at the time, to clinch the {{demonstration}} that the Jesuits were concerned in Godfrey's murder, L'Estrange says, and he brings in his <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove,</b> that the London rumour existed, and {{could reach the}} country by post. In fact, Chetwyn, on the evidence of Sanbidge, suggested this improvement of his original romance to Dugdale, and Sanbidge contradicted Chetwyn. He knew nothing of the matter. Such {{is the value of}} the only testimony against the Jesuits which deserves consideration.|$|R
6000|$|... "True--and I {{am glad to}} know by {{your last}} words that you are {{sensitive}} about the justice of what you propose to do. Indifference to pure and simple justice is the great curse of mankind. It is not indeed the root, {{but it is the}} fruit of our sins. The suspicion that detains Baderoon is more than justified, for I could bring many <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that he has vowed to take my life, and I know him to be a murderer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "On {{the other}} hand, Mr. Henry Oranmore, K.C., very ably and courteously {{replied that he}} too had several <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that Mr. Brooks {{certainly}} did make a will on the day in question, and that, whatever his intentions {{may have been in}} the past, he must have modified them on the day of his death, for the will proved by Mr. Percival Brooks was found after his death under his pillow, duly signed and witnessed and in every way legal.|$|R
50|$|The {{trial was}} adjourned several times due to legal arguments. It soon became politicised as Paul Kruger, the defence lawyer, {{argued that the}} South African {{government}} was illegitimate and unconstitutional, and that the first multi-racial elections in the country had not been valid, as white voters had never been consulted. The defence originally planned to call the former President of South Africa, FW De Klerk, as a <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> their case. The court later ruled {{that he could not}} be forced to stand.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Snyder's {{breath was}} not often taken {{away in his}} own office. As a rule, he {{received}} his clients' communications calmly, strange as they often were. But at her words he gasped. The thought crossed his mind that Mrs. Pickett might well be mentally unbalanced. The details of the case were fresh in his memory, and he distinctly recollected that the person she mentioned had been away from the boarding house {{on the night of}} Captain Gunner's death, and could, he imagined, produce <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{makes the}} {{identification}} so easy," [...] he pointed out, [...] "and {{no one knew}} of it except he. I could easily get a <b>witness</b> presently <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that I am Merton Ware." ...|$|R

However, Robert, who was to inherit Annandale on Esther's death, commenced court proceedings in March 1829 against her, to have her declared insane and incapable of running the Annandale properly. Esther put up a strong legal battle, producing many <b>witnesses</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> she was of sound mind. Her refutation of the insanity claim was upheld; but trustees were nonetheless appointed to manage her affairs. Following the case, Esther {{went to live with}} David.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} {{a new approach}} <b>to</b> <b>proving</b> termination with size change graphs. This is the first decision procedure for size change termination (SCT) which makes direct use of global ranking functions. It handles a well-defined and significant subset of SCT instances, designed to be amenable to a SAT-based solution. We have implemented the approach using a state-of-the-art Boolean satisfaction solver. Experimentation indicates that the approach is {{a viable alternative to}} the complete SCT decision procedure based on closure computation and local ranking functions. Our approach has the extra benefit of producing an explicit <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> termination {{in the form of a}} global ranking function. ...|$|R
