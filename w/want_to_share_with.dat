6000|$|There {{are good}} things which we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>with</b> {{the world and}} good things which {{we want to keep}} to ourselves. The secret of our {{favourite}} restaurant, to take a case, is guarded jealously from all but a few intimates; the secret, to take a contrary case, of our infallible remedy for seasickness is thrust upon every traveller we meet, even if he be no more than a casual acquaintance about to cross the Serpentine. So with our books. There are dearly loved books of which we babble to a neighbour at dinner, insisting that she shall share our delight in them; and there are books, equally dear to us, of which we say nothing, fearing lest the praise of others should cheapen the glory of our discovery. The books of [...] "Saki" [...] were, for me at least, in the second class.|$|E
60|$|Cicero {{makes his}} points {{so well that}} I would fain go through the whole speech, were it not that a similar reason might induce me to give abridgments of all his speeches. It may not be that the readers of these orations will always sympathize with the orator in the matter which he has in hand--though his power over words is so great as to carry the reader with him very generally, even at this {{distance}} of time--but the neatness with which the weapon is used, {{the effectiveness of the}} thrust for the purpose intended, the certainty with which the nail is hit on the head--never with an expenditure of unnecessary force, but always with the exact strength wanted for the purpose--these are the characteristics of Cicero's speeches which carry the reader on with a delight which he will <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>with</b> others, as a man when he has heard a good story instantly wishes to tell it again. And with Cicero we are charmed by the modernness, by the tone of to-day, which his language takes. The rapid way in which he runs from scorn to pity, from pity to anger, from anger to public zeal, and then instantly to irony and ridicule, implies a lightness of touch which, not unreasonably, surprises us as having endured for so many hundred years. That poetry should remain to us, even lines so vapid as some of those in which Ovid sung of love, seems to be more natural, because verses, though they be light, must have been labored. But these words spoken by Cicero seem almost to ring in our ears as having come to us direct from a man's lips. We see the anger gathering on the brow of Hortensius, followed by a look of acknowledged defeat. We see the startled attention of the judges as they began to feel that in this case they must depart from their intended purpose. We can understand how Cæcilius cowered, and found consolation in being relieved from his task. We can fancy how Verres suffered--Verres whom no shame could have touched--when all his bribes were becoming inefficient under the hands of the orator.|$|E

30|$|Participants in {{both groups}} <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> their moods and {{feelings}} (20 %), physical health (15 %), physical activities (20 %), and interests (15 %) (Table  1).

Other information they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> was their interests (30 %), to show “who I am and what I am good at,” and physical health (30 %), such as burned calories and heart rate. Among EX, many preferred not sharing about themselves (50 %) due to discomfort and concerns about privacy. The aspects they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>with</b> others were physical activities (40 %) like number of steps they walked. Several <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> only <b>with</b> small groups (30 %) of their families or friends.

The experience of using wearables may arouse attention to privacy issues and developers could consider how to protect the privacy of users, and make them feel comfortable when using wearables (Drugge et al. 2006). Thus, designers would need to consider how to develop wearable trackers without violating privacy issues especially for EX.|$|R

50|$|Social {{media is}} more than just the {{communication}} of words. With social media increasing in popularity, pictures have become a large role in how many people communicate. Research conducted in 2013 found that over 57% of pictures posted on social networking sites were sexual and were created to gain attention. More shockingly, 58% of women and 45% of men don't look into the camera, which is creating an illusion of withdrawal. Other factors to be considered are the poses in pictures such as women laying down in subordinate positions or even touching themselves in child like ways. In conclusion, research has found that images shared online through social networking sites help establish personal self-reflections that individuals <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>with</b> the world.|$|E
