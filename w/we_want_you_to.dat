25|$|Trump and Kiyosaki intersperse {{financial}} {{lessons with}} personal anecdotes from their respective careers. They elaborate on points previously raised in Why <b>We</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> <b>to</b> be Rich, and criticize {{a dearth of}} financial literacy education in the U.S. system. The authors warn of the middle-class squeeze and the harm this will cause to the American middle class.

25|$|Midas Touch elaborates on points made by Trump and Kiyosaki {{in their}} prior work Why <b>We</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> <b>to</b> be Rich. The coauthors assert their ideas {{will lead to}} an uptick in the American economy. Trump and Kiyosaki lament the lack of {{financial}} literacy espoused in the U.S. education structure. They argue students should be taught how to become business owners instead of learning how to go work for another company. Trump and Kiyosaki write that such students are instructed to achieve academic excellence through avoiding risk. They say those who do engage in risk will learn from their mistakes and be stronger for it.|$|E
25|$|Why <b>We</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> <b>to</b> Be Rich {{notes in}} the {{introduction}} it is not intended as a technical manual with specific recommendations. The book warns the reader that the American middle class strata is shrinking due to multiple factors including oncoming retirement of the baby boomers, rising costs of light crude oil, decreasing employer pay to employees, increasing national debt of the United States, and a declining power of the United States dollar. The authors caution that individuals should not rely on the federal bureaucracy for support from problems including the middle-class squeeze, economic globalization, and threats of terrorism. They assert that employment opportunities are not formed from the government but rather through entrepreneurship.|$|E

The coauthors became familiar with each other through encounters at the company The Learning Annex.

25|$|Trip Brennan of The Intercept {{reviewed}} both Why <b>We</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> <b>to</b> be Rich and Midas Touch, and {{was critical}} of both books. Brennan criticized Midas Touch for its support of multi-level marketing, a practice he described as a pyramid scheme in disguise. He wrote negatively of the book's discounting of investment in mutual funds. BuzzFeed News wrote about the work during Trump's 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, and contrasted the book's views on the changing American economy with Trump's statements from the campaign trail. BuzzFeed News was critical Trump had shifted his perspective from the book, where he had previously written U.S. industrial jobs would never return and individuals needed to learn to cope with new skills in the Information Age. Business Insider similarly compared the work with Trump's 2016 campaign message, noting the book ended with a passage embracing immigrants whereas the Trump campaign {{was critical of}} illegal immigration from Mexico.|$|E

[...] The review noted, [...] "They sell positive thinking and can-do haziness -- specific details cost extra." ...|$|E
