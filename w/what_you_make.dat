25|$|Yes, I suppose. The {{violence}} {{served a}} therapeutic purpose. It's unsettling {{to think that}} at any moment life can flare up into senseless violence. But it can and does, and {{people need to be}} ready for it. <b>What</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> for others is first of all <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> for yourself. If I’m persuaded that our life is predicated upon violence, that the entire structure of what we call civilization, the scaffolding that we’ve built up over the millennia, can collapse at any moment, then whatever I write is going to be affected by that assumption. The process of life presupposes violence, in the plant world the same as the animal world. But among the animals only man can conceptualize violence. Only man can enjoy the idea of destruction.|$|E

500|$|Metalholic said 'I’m back…” [...] I can’t {{think of}} a more {{appropriate}} way to flow into the second track “Tragic Magic.” [...] Ronnie Radke is most definitely back {{and he is not}} afraid to tell you so.' This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again. [...] Life is <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> of it, if you have lost yourself, it is up to you to find your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E
500|$|The main show {{started with}} Cyrus {{descending}} {{onto the stage}} in a neon pink cube that bore a digital image of her silhouette, as pink fireworks were fired behind her. Donning a long, sequined, cheetah and black-striped tank top and cardigan, sparkling black tights, black boots, and the blonde Hannah Montana wig, she began to perform the concert's opening number, [...] "Rock Star". In continuation, Cyrus was joined by multiple backup dancers to perform dance routines for [...] "Life's <b>What</b> <b>You</b> <b>Make</b> It". Removing the cardigan, she concluded the segment with [...] "Just Like You". Still costumed as Hannah Montana, Cyrus reappeared {{from the back of}} the stage, wearing sparkly blue denim jeans, a white tank top, a blue denim vest, and shiny silver tie; she performed [...] "Old Blue Jeans" [...] among female backup dancers and [...] "Nobody's Perfect" [...] roaming the stage alone. The next segment began with the performance of [...] "Pumpin' Up the Party", where Cyrus dressed with a pink and purple sequined mini-dress, fuchsia ad violet tights and maroon boots and dancers wore 1960s-inspired attires while performing calisthenics. The segment continued with [...] "I Got Nerve", which required participation and elaborate routines on behalf of the dancers, and a duet with the opening act. While they served as opening act, [...] "We Got the Party" [...] was performed as a duet with the Jonas Brothers. She annexed a pink and purple trench coat to her attire and performed with the Jonas Brothers, who also played electric guitars. At one point of the performance, Cyrus disappeared to be replaced by a body double who completed the performance. While Aly & A.J. and Everlife served as opening acts, a postmodern cover of Kiss' [...] "Rock and Roll All Nite" [...] (1975) was performed by them and Cyrus wore a geometric-patterned cocktail dress. Afterwards, the opening act performed an interlude of several songs.|$|E
