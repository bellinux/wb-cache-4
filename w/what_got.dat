25|$|The Rainbow follows {{three generations}} of a Nottinghamshire farming family from the pre-{{industrial}} to the industrial age, focusing particularly on a daughter, Ursula, and her aspiration for a more fulfilling life than that of becoming a housebound wife. Women in Love delves into the complex relationships between four major characters, including the sisters Ursula and Gudrun. Both novels challenged conventional ideas about the arts, politics, economic growth, gender, sexual experience, friendship and marriage and {{can be seen as}} far ahead of their time. The frank and relatively straightforward manner in which Lawrence dealt with sexual attraction was ostensibly <b>what</b> <b>got</b> the books banned, perhaps in particular the mention of same-sex attraction – Ursula has an affair with a woman in The Rainbow and in Women in Love there is an undercurrent of attraction between the two principal male characters.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Hook arrives to the mansion to warn Emma, but Gold thwarts his efforts, erases his {{phone calls to}} Emma, and ties him to the fence. Inside the mansion, Elsa finds Emma and tells her that she sees her {{doing the same thing}} that she once did, blaming herself {{for not being able to}} control her powers because her family was harmed, and that she should be blessed to have this gift. Elsa then asks Emma for her hand and she takes it, {{resulting}} in Emma's powers returning to normal. Outside, Gold, upset over what he just saw, becomes furious over his failed attempt to take Emma's power, which pleased Hook. However, Gold says that despite the setback, he will find a way to acquire the power to free him of the Dagger of Kris. But Gold also needs another item: the heart of someone who knew Gold before he became the Dark One. Since Killian is the only one left alive, Gold takes his heart. By doing so, Gold makes Killian his puppet and vows to use him to find another way to get Emma's powers, before he will kill him. As Hook reunites with Emma and kisses her, Emma wondered <b>what</b> <b>got</b> into him, and after she and Elsa walk away, he grabs the Sorcerer's box and hides it inside the jacket. Regina arrives at the library, where Robin shows her a page that featured the two together at the pub back in the Enchanted Forest, leading to indications that whoever wrote the story wanted them to be together. Back at the Snow Queen's lair, Ingrid, now free of the force field, follows through with her plan to bring her three sisters together by sending out her ribbons to Emma and Elsa. As Emma and Elsa are reunited with David, Mary Margaret, and Henry, she unleashed her magic into the sky, which creates colorful auroras and then fireworks. Unfortunately, Emma and Elsa notice the yellow ribbons on their left wrists too late, and that they can't remove their ribbons, even while the ribbons are siphoning away their power.|$|E

500|$|Some {{similarities}} {{exist between}} the character of W.P. Mayhew and novelist William Faulkner. Like Mayhew, Faulkner became known as a preeminent writer of Southern literature and later worked in the movie business. Like Faulkner, Mayhew is a heavy drinker and speaks contemptuously about Hollywood. Faulkner's name appeared in the Hollywood 1940s history book City of Nets, which the Coens read while creating Barton Fink. Ethan explained in 1998: [...] "I read this story in passing that Faulkner was assigned to write a wrestling picture.... That was part of <b>what</b> <b>got</b> us going on the whole Barton Fink thing." [...] Faulkner worked on a wrestling film called Flesh (1932), which starred Wallace Beery, the actor for whom Barton is writing. The focus on wrestling was fortuitous for the Coens, as they participated in the sport in high school.|$|E

[...] Dan Aquilante of the New York Post stated that after the Beyoncé's performances of the songs on 4 at the concerts, the album was to be rated a 10 out of 10. He further wrote, [...] "Where tunes felt lackluster and flabby on the recording, Beyoncé injected a vibrancy in the new songs that boosted the material to be almost the equal to some of her best and biggest radio hits." [...] Yolanda Sangweni of Essence magazine viewed the concert as a chance for Beyoncé to remind people that her [...] "vocal chops" [...] are <b>what</b> <b>got</b> her where she stands today as an artist, and concluded that Michael Jackson and Diana Ross would be very proud of Beyoncé's accomplishments and performances on 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé.|$|E
500|$|When {{reviewing}} Slipknot's show in Düsseldorf, Sebastian Huhn called Shawn Crahan's hydraulic percussion platform as {{a highlight}} of the performance. However, he also said, [...] "Even though the tour had been named after the new album, the most part of the set consisted of tracks from the previous releases." [...] Huhn rated Slipknot's overall performance 8 out of 10. Alistair Lawrence of Kerrang! reviewed {{the first of the}} band's three shows at the Hammersmith Apollo in London. He said, [...] "The choreographed chaos is too multi-faceted to fully describe", and noted that Taylor's performance made songs like [...] "Before I Forget" [...] and [...] "Psychosocial" [...] sound better than on the recorded versions. Overall, Lawrence scored the show 4 out of 5. When reviewing one of the Hammersmith Apollo shows, Rick Pearson of the Evening Standard wrote that there was [...] "a strong feeling of camaraderie" [...] at the concert. While he admitted he did not understand the draw of the band, [...] "Spit It Out" [...] offered [...] "glimpses as to <b>what</b> <b>got</b> the maggots hooked on this brutal, bludgeoning band." [...] Adrian Osmond of Western Mail said that their show in Cardiff was [...] "a pretty flawless, colourful and exciting piece of musical theatre", adding that on entertainment value it would [...] "rival any of the pantomimes out there this month." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{recorded}} at the Darryl F. Zanuck Building on the 20th Century Fox lot in West Los Angeles, where {{the cast and}} crew of The Simpsons gathered on a Monday morning in October 1993. Before the recording session took part, the main voice actors of the show (Dan Castellaneta, Harry Shearer, Julie Kavner, Yeardley Smith, Nancy Cartwright, and Hank Azaria) sat down with executive producer David Mirkin and a crew of writers at a table reading to determine what shape the script was in. There was [...] "genuine hearty laughter at various points" [...] during the script run-through, said Ray Richmond, a reporter for the Los Angeles Daily News. Immediately after the reading, the crew of writers hurried to make script changes based on <b>what</b> <b>got</b> laughs and what did not, while the actors waited impatiently. Mirkin told Richmond that the script would require the equivalent of ten rewrites: [...] "At every step, there are amendments and additions and refinements." [...] Richmond commented that as the recording session started, the [...] "astounding versatility" [...] of the actors became clear; [...] "Castellaneta bounces from being Homer to Grampa to Barney without taking a breath and minus any evident vocal similarities." [...] Mirkin said the episode was also a tour de force for Kavner, who in one scene voices Marge, Marge's two sisters, and Marge's mother. He added that even though she enjoyed the process, it was tough on Kavner's voice because those characters talk with [...] "gravelly voices".|$|E

500|$|Soon after, Moore and Black quit {{their old}} band, the Starlite Wranglers, {{to play with}} Presley regularly, and DJ and {{promoter}} Bob Neal became the trio's manager. From August through October, they played frequently at the Eagle's Nest club and returned to Sun Studio for more recording sessions, and Presley quickly grew more confident on stage. According to Moore, [...] "His movement was a natural thing, {{but he was also}} very conscious of <b>what</b> <b>got</b> a reaction. He'd do something one time and then he would expand on it real quick." [...] Presley made what would be his only appearance on Nashville's Grand Ole Opry on October 2; after a polite audience response, Opry manager Jim Denny told Phillips that his singer was [...] "not bad" [...] but did not suit the program. Two weeks later, Presley was booked on Louisiana Hayride, the Oprys chief, and more adventurous, rival. The Shreveport-based show was broadcast to 198 radio stations in 28 states. Presley had another attack of nerves during the first set, which drew a muted reaction. A more composed and energetic second set inspired an enthusiastic response. House drummer D. J. Fontana brought a new element, complementing Presley's movements with accented beats that he had mastered playing in strip clubs. Soon after the show, the Hayride engaged Presley for a year's worth of Saturday-night appearances. Trading in his old guitar for $8 (and seeing it promptly dispatched to the garbage), he purchased a Martin instrument for $175, and his trio began playing in new locales including Houston, Texas, and Texarkana, Arkansas.|$|E

2500|$|In April 1985, Loveless {{felt her}} {{marriage}} to Terry Lovelace was ending (they eventually divorced amicably in 1986). She contacted her brother Roger to help her get back to Nashville. [...] After being in the rock 'n' roll scene for so long she felt {{completely out of the}} country-music loop but wanted to sing country music again.

2500|$|The {{audition}} process proved difficult, {{as some of}} Akingbola's {{close friends}} were also considered for the part. He was dually motivated {{by the prospect of}} financial security, and the role itself. Enthused by the character outline, he tailored his performance to the detailed breakdown he was given, and attended his audition dressed in the style he believed Malick would wear. Akingbola recalls, [...] "They were very open with me, encouraging me to push it further and make him more aggressive." [...] The producers were flexible when it came to his interpretation of the character, and Akingbola believes it was his intense portrayal which secured him the role. He explained: [...] "They were looking for someone to put the flesh on the character, and that's what I did. I even wondered whether I was pushing it too much, as people might have wondered how such an extreme person could be a doctor. But I think that's <b>what</b> <b>got</b> me the part in the end – {{they were looking for a}} character who would be in people's faces, be a bit dangerous and speak his mind!" [...] Following his successful audition, Akingbola began filming in September 2010. It took several months for him to become accustomed to the job security; initially he took extra roles before arriving to film Holby City. His first episode as Malick aired in January 2011.|$|E

2500|$|However, one of {{the most}} {{controversial}} moments of Pippen's career came in his first year without Jordan. In the 1994 NBA Playoffs, the Eastern Conference Semifinals pitted the Bulls against the New York Knicks, whom the Bulls had dispatched en route to a championship each of the previous three seasons. On May 13, 1994, down 2–0 in the series in Game 3, Bulls coach Phil Jackson needed a big play from his team to have any chance of going on to the conference finals. With 1.8 seconds left and the score tied at 102, Jackson designed the last play for rookie Toni Kukoč, with Pippen instructed to inbound the basketball. Pippen, who had been the Bulls' leader all season long in Jordan's absence, was so angered by Jackson's decision to not let him take the potential game-winner that he refused to leave the bench and re-enter the game when the timeout was over. Although Kukoč did hit the game-winner, a 23-foot fadeaway jumper at the buzzer, there was little celebrating by the Bulls, as television cameras caught an unsmiling Phil Jackson storming off the court. [...] "Scottie asked out of the play," [...] Jackson told reporters moments later in the post-game interview. Teammate Steve Kerr elaborated when asked to recall the event: [...] "I don't know <b>what</b> <b>got</b> into Pippen. He is such a great teammate and maybe the pressure was getting to him and he just could not take it anymore, no one knows for sure but he is a team player." ...|$|E
