5|$|A Turkish kilim is a flat-woven rug from Anatolia. Although {{the name}} kilim is {{sometimes}} used loosely in the West {{to include all}} type of rug such as cicim, palaz, soumak and zili, in fact any type other than pile carpets, the name kilim properly denotes a specific weaving technique. Cicim, palaz, soumak and zili are made using three groups of threads, namely longitudinal warps, crossing wefts, and wrapping coloured threads. The wrapping threads give these rugs additional thickness and strength. Kilim in contrast are woven flat, using only warp and weft threads. Kilim patterns are created by winding the weft threads, which are coloured, backwards and forwards around pairs of <b>warp</b> <b>threads,</b> leaving the resulting weave completely flat. Kilim are therefore called flatweave or flatware rugs.|$|E
5|$|A kilim is an Islamic flatwoven carpet (without a pile), {{whether for}} {{household}} use or a prayer mat. The pattern {{is made by}} winding the weft threads back over the <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> when a colour boundary is reached. This technique leaves a gap or vertical slit, so kilims are sometimes called slit-woven textiles. Kilims are often decorated with geometric patterns with 2- or 4-fold mirror or rotational symmetries. Because weaving uses vertical and horizontal threads, curves are difficult to generate, and patterns are accordingly formed mainly with straight edges. Kilim patterns are often characteristic of specific regions. Kilim motifs are often symbolic as well as decorative. For example, the wolf's mouth or wolf's foot motif (Turkish: Kurt Aǧzi, Kurt İzi) expresses the tribal weavers' desires for protection of their families' flocks from wolves.|$|E
25|$|Picking:The {{operation}} of projecting the shuttle {{from side to}} side of the loom through the division in the <b>warp</b> <b>threads.</b> This is done by the overpick or underpick motions. The overpick is suitable for quick-running looms, whereas the underpick is best for heavy or slow looms.|$|E

25|$|Citing this, the Mishnah Berurah {{rules that}} not only are women not to prepare or attach <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> to a weaving loom, but it is {{forbidden}} for anyone to make, buy or wear new clothes or shoes {{from the beginning of}} the week in which Tisha B'Av falls until after the fast, and that people should ideally not do so from the beginning of Av.|$|E
25|$|The Dobcross H.K. {{box loom}} was {{manufactured}} in ca.1950 by Hutchinson, Hollingworth & Co. Ltd of Dobcross, Oldham. This loom was claimed by its makers {{to be one}} of the most widely used power looms in the woollen and worsted industries. It was used, with minor adaptations, for weaving goods as varied as light tropical suiting, costume cloths, overcoatings, army and police uniform cloths and heavy blankets. The main feature of this loom is the dobby (located top right of the loom with the hand wheel) which is known as the Knowles, American or positive wheel dobby. This device lifts and lowers the wooden shafts through which the warp ends are threaded, separating the <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> to produce the shed. The loom has four rising or drop boxes at each side, which can be moved independently, and can weave up to seven shuttles, each with a different colour.|$|E
25|$|Twisting is {{the process}} in which two or more single-spun yarns are united to produce a yarn of greater {{strength}} for use as <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> in the weaving process and for normal knitting purposes. This is done by rollers delivering the yarns to a revolving spindle which twists or folds the single yarns around one another. The machines used are similar to spinning frames in their method of applying twist, but differ in that they have only one set of delivery rollers {{instead of the usual}} complement of drafting rollers. This machine is an early example of a flyer twisting frame. On the flyer twister, twist imparted to the yarn in a similar manner as on the flyer spinner. A weighted band, running in a groove {{at the base of the}} bobbin, retards the revolving bobbin creating enough tension for the flyer to wind the yarn evenly onto the bobbin. The machine is hand doffed.|$|E
50|$|Tent stitch is a small, {{diagonal}} needlepoint stitch {{that crosses}} over {{the intersection of}} one horizontal (weft) and one vertical (<b>warp)</b> <b>thread</b> of needlepoint canvas forming a slanted stitch at a 45-degree angle. It {{is also known as}} Needlepoint stitch {{and is one of the}} most basic and versatile stitches used in Needlepoint and other Canvas work embroidery. When worked on fine weave canvas over a single <b>warp</b> and weft <b>thread</b> it is known as Petit point in contrast to stitches, such as Gobelin, worked over multiple <b>warp</b> and/or weft <b>threads.</b>|$|R
40|$|Basic weave {{structures}} — interlacement patterns — can {{be described}} in many ways, but they all come down to representing the crossings of <b>warp</b> and weft <b>threads.</b> One or the other is on top. This is represented in drawdowns by a grid in which the cells represent the intersections and (usually) a cell is black if the <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> is on top but white if the weft thread is on top. See Figure Ω. 1. Note: This material should be covered in the introduction to the book. Figure Ω. 1. Drawdown From a computational point of view, 1 s and 0 s instead of colors are the natural representation of interlacement patterns. See Figure Ω. 2, which corresponds to the drawdown of Figure Ω. 1.

25|$|The first {{tapestries}} {{were brought}} by Queen Bona Sforza as her wedding dowry. Then in 1526 and 1533, Sigismund I the Old ordered 108 fabrics in Antwerp and Bruges. Most of the tapestries, however, were commissioned by king Sigismund II Augustus in Brussels in the workshops of Willem and Jan de Kempeneer, Jan van Tieghem and Nicolas Leyniers between 1550-1565. Initially, {{there were about}} 170 tapestries in the royal collection, among them 84 black-and-white tapestries with the royal crest and the letters SA, 8 tapestries which Sigismund I the Old had been received from the Emperor Maximilian I, and others, gifts from foreign delegations. The gifts include one tapestry with the Polish eagle bearing the date 1560, the royal initials and the letters CKCH (Christophorus Krupski Capitaneus Horodlo) next to the Korczak coat of arms and the inscription SCABELLVM PEDVM TVORVM (the footstool under your feet, Psalm 110, A Psalm of David), a gift from Krzysztof Krupski, starost of Horodło for Sigismund Augustus. The tapestries had been displayed publicly {{for the first time}} during the wedding of king Sigismund Augustus with Catherine of Austria. To this day, preserved about 138 of which exposed are about 30. They were matched in size to the walls and some of them reach the size of 5 × 9 m (5.47 × 9.84 yd). The tapestries were made of wool strands, silk and gold and woven on looms with a density of about 8 - 10 <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> per centimeter.|$|E
25|$|Like weaving, {{knitting}} is {{a technique}} for producing a two-dimensional fabric made from a one-dimensional yarn or thread. In weaving, threads are always straight, running parallel either lengthwise (<b>warp</b> <b>threads)</b> or crosswise (weft threads). By contrast, the yarn in knitted fabrics follows a meandering path (a course), forming symmetric loops (also called bights) symmetrically {{above and below the}} mean path of the yarn. These meandering loops can be easily stretched in different directions giving knit fabrics much more elasticity than woven fabrics. Depending on the yarn and knitting pattern, knitted garments can stretch as much as 500%. For this reason, knitting was initially developed for garments that must be elastic or stretch in response to the wearer's motions, such as socks and hosiery. For comparison, woven garments stretch mainly along one or other of a related pair of directions that lie roughly diagonally between the warp and the weft, while contracting in the other direction of the pair (stretching and contracting with the bias), and are not very elastic, unless they are woven from stretchable material such as spandex. Knitted garments are often more form-fitting than woven garments, since their elasticity allows them to contour to the body's outline more closely; by contrast, curvature is introduced into most woven garments only with sewn darts, flares, gussets and gores, the seams of which lower the elasticity of the woven fabric still further. Extra curvature can be introduced into knitted garments without seams, as in the heel of a sock; the effect of darts, flares, etc. can be obtained with short rows or by increasing or decreasing the number of stitches. Thread used in weaving is usually much finer than the yarn used in knitting, which can give the knitted fabric more bulk and less drape than a woven fabric.|$|E
500|$|Sprang is {{an ancient}} method of {{constructing}} fabric that has a natural elasticity. [...] Its appearance is similar to netting, but unlike netting sprang is constructed entirely from <b>warp</b> <b>threads.</b> [...] Archaeological evidence indicates that sprang predates knitting; the two needlework forms bear a visible resemblance and serve similar functions but require different production techniques.|$|E
50|$|Mono canvas {{comes in}} the widest variety of colors (especially 18 mesh) and is plain woven, with one weft thread going over and under one <b>warp</b> <b>thread.</b> This canvas has the most {{possibilities}} for manipulation and open canvas. It is used for hand-painted canvases as well as counted thread canvaswork.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} dynamic {{optimization}} technique, <b>thread</b> <b>warping,</b> {{that uses a}} single processor on a multiprocessor system to dynamically synthesize threads into custom accelerator circuits on FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays). Building on dynamic synthesis for single-processor single-thread systems, known as <b>warp</b> processing, <b>thread</b> <b>warping</b> improves performances of multiprocessor systems by speeding up individual threads and by allowing more threads to execute concurrently. Furthermore, <b>thread</b> <b>warping</b> maintains the important separation of function from architecture, enabling portability of applications to architectures with different quantities of microprocessors and FPGA—an advantage not shared by static compilation/synthesis approaches. We introduce a framework of architecture, CAD tools, and operating system that together support <b>thread</b> <b>warping.</b> We summarize experiments on an extensive architectural simulation framework we developed, showing application speedups of 4 x to 502 x, averaging 130 x compared to a multiprocessor system having four ARM 11 microprocessors, for eight benchmark applications. Even compared to a 64 -processor system, <b>thread</b> <b>warping</b> achieves 11 x speedup...|$|R
5000|$|The Ikat {{technique}} (also called [...] "chong kiet" [...] in Khmer) {{is one of}} {{the most}} ancient weaving techniques in the world and is used to create designs in fabrics. Artisans create a tight knot resistant to dyes which forms an original pattern with the complex intertwining of the <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> and the weft thread.|$|R
500|$|In principle, sprang may be {{regarded}} as a practical application of the fiber manipulation techniques used in the children's game known as cat's cradle. [...] Sprang is made by preparing a set of <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> either on a rectangular frame or between a pair of beams. [...] The craftsperson then generates a fabric by interlinking the <b>warp</b> <b>threads.</b> [...] Unlike most textile production techniques that add new rows at the end of completed rows, sprang works upon the center of a group of fibers and the material grows inward from both ends with symmetrical top and bottom halves. [...] The craftsperson must maintain control of the center area or the structure unravels: most sprang worked upon has too many fibers to keep in hand, so rods or sticks maintain the appropriate fiber positions. [...] The fiber manipulation itself is done by the craftsperson's fingers. [...] Decorative patterns may be generated by regular variations in the fiber crossings. [...] As crossings accumulate the craftsperson beats the material flat with a stick. [...] Work continues with the material growing from both edges toward the middle until the center band becomes too tight to continue work. [...] The completed fabric is either separated into two identical items or permanently secured at the middle to stabilize the contrary twists. [...] In traditions where two halves of sprang are not severed by cutting, this center seam is a telltale sign of sprang manufacture.|$|E
500|$|Traditional Navajo weaving used upright looms with no moving parts. Support poles were {{traditionally}} {{constructed of}} wood; steel pipe {{is more common}} today. The artisan sits on the floor during weaving and wraps the finished portion of fabric underneath the loom as it grows. [...] The average weaver takes anywhere from 2 months to many years to finish a single rug. [...] The size greatly determines {{the amount of time}} spent weaving a rug. The ratio of weft to <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> had a fine count before the Bosque Redondo internment and declined in the following decades, then rose somewhat to a midrange ratio of five to one for the period 1920-1940. 19th-century warps were colored handspun wool or cotton string, then switched to white handspun wool in the early decades of the 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|Shedding: The {{operation}} of dividing the warp into two lines, {{so that the}} shuttle can pass between these lines. There are two general kinds of sheds-"open" [...] and [...] "closed."

Closed Shed-The <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> are all placed level in one line after each pick.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of tulle is actually bobbinet, invented in Britain {{in the early}} 19th century. Bobbinet is made by wrapping the weft <b>thread</b> around the <b>warp</b> <b>thread,</b> creating a strong hexagonal design which tends not to twist or fall out of shape, because the wrapped threads maintain a state of tension. The result is tulle netting which is lightweight and surprisingly strong and durable for its weight.|$|R
5000|$|Patterns {{result from}} a {{combination}} of the warp dye and the weft <b>thread</b> colour. Some <b>warp</b> ikat traditions are designed with vertical-axis symmetry or have a [...] "mirror-image" [...] running along their long centre line. That is, whatever pattern or design is woven on the right is duplicated on the left in reverse order about a central <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> group. Patterns can be created in the vertical, horizontal or diagonal.|$|R
40|$|To date, in {{the textile}} {{manufacturing}} process of warp knitting, trouble-shooting and process optimization mainly rely on empirical knowledge and experiments.

On the other hand, using simulations, different phenomena that {{affect the quality of}} the knitted fabric and the knitting process can be clarified in the run-up of the experiments. Consequently, an increase in quality and flexibility can be reached with reduced experimental effort.

2500|$|On a knotted {{pile carpet}} (formally, a [...] "supplementary weft cut-loop pile" [...] carpet), the {{structural}} weft threads alternate with a supplementary weft that rises {{at right angles}} {{to the surface of the}} weave. This supplementary weft is attached to the warp by one of three knot types (see below), such as shag carpet which was popular in the 1970s, to form the pile or nap of the carpet. Knotting by hand is most prevalent in oriental rugs and carpets. Kashmir carpets are also hand-knotted. Pile carpets, like flat carpets, can be woven on a loom. Both vertical and horizontal looms have been used in the production of European and oriental carpets. The <b>warp</b> <b>threads</b> are set up on the frame of the loom before weaving begins. A number of weavers may work together on the same carpet. A row of knots is completed and cut. The knots are secured with (usually one to four) rows of weft. The warp in woven carpet is usually cotton and the weft is jute.|$|E

40|$|The weaving {{process is}} {{substantially}} {{influenced by the}} <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> tension. In order to obtain good fabric quality at a smooth run of the loom, the optimisation of the <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> tension is necessary. The tension is influenced by a multitude of parameters, especially the back shedding geometry. The pure analytical determination of the best back shedding geometry is not possible. The experimental determination of the best loom setting takes up {{a great deal of}} time and is only an approximation. This complex task occurs particularly with new products, for which the user has not established machine settings yet. Within the framework of the presented thesis the development of a technical system is presented that provides optimised machine settings based on machine and fabric specific data and with help of mathematic methods and simulations. Neural networks have been trained and tested for the prediction of ideal article and machine specific <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> tension sequences (comparison tension sequences) based on empiric data of weaving mills. For that the necessary product, machine and operational data was collected on very well adjusted weaving machines with satisfactory processing performance and fabric quality over a long time period. This data has been analysed by special mathematic methods. The determination of the machine setting from the tension sequence is not possible directly. Because of that the optimisation algorithm of the AUTO-WARP-concept, that has been developed at the Institut für Textiltechnik der RWTH Aachen (ITA), is used. According to the principle of evolution strategy and based on fabric and machine data, the comparison tension sequence and by the help of a special simulation program of the ITA for <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> tension sequences the fabric and machine specific optimised machine setting is calculated. For an easy operation the various described components have been put together to one program and a common user interface was created to achieve a simple data input according to the demand of a weaving mill. The developed system was tested in practise for the product family of aramid yarns. In the practise test the developed adjustment device was able to determine good and very good machine settings for new products and machines, although the test fabric was far out of the training product spectrum. With the recommended loom setting the <b>warp</b> <b>thread</b> tension sequence, the run of the loom and the fabric quality were improved clearly. The adjustment device is a tool for the weaver that makes a good and quick fabric specific adjustment of the back shedding possible even for new fabrics. By this it enable the weaver to reduce material, machine and personal costs and to improve the fabric quality. The program is simple to operate and runs on usual personal computers. In order to use the system for new product families the neural networks have to be trained with corresponding data. This further conversion and marketing strategies are viewed finally...|$|R
