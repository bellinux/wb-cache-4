5|$|After {{the death}} of her {{grandson}} in August 1963, Calment lived on her own from age 88 until shortly before her 110th birthday, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>decided</b> to move to a nursing home. Her move was precipitated by the winter of 1985 which froze the water pipes in her house (she never used heating in the winter) and caused frostbite in her hands. According to one of her doctors, she had hitherto been healthy but began showing signs of senescence (or aging) at this point.|$|E

She {{was buried in the}} cathedral of Várad (now Oradea in Romania). Mary's sister, Jadwiga, claimed the crown, but Sigismund retained it without much difficulty.|$|E

5|$|Steffy Forrester is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the American CBS soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful. Introduced by Bradley Bell, {{she is currently}} portrayed by Jacqueline MacInnes Wood. Steffy and her twin sister Phoebe (MacKenzie Mauzy) were born onscreen as the daughters of supercouple Ridge Forrester (Ronn Moss, later Thorsten Kaye) and Taylor Hayes (Hunter Tylo) during the episode airing on September 21, 1999. For the character's first five-year period, she appeared as a minor. In 2005, Steffy was rapidly aged to a teenager, and in 2008 she appeared as an adult when Wood took over the role. Wood portrayed the role continuously until 2013, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>decided</b> to leave her regular capacity with the series; following a series of guest appearances, Wood returned as a series regular in 2015.|$|E
5|$|The novel has {{pervasive}} lesbian themes, {{concentrating on}} eroticism and self-discovery. Waters {{was working on}} a PhD dissertation in English literature <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>decided</b> to write a story she would like to read. Employing her love for the variety of people and districts in London, she consciously chose an urban setting. As opposed to previous lesbian-themed fiction she had read where the characters escape an oppressive society to live apart from it, Waters chose characters who interact with their surroundings. She has acknowledged that the book imagines a lesbian presence and history in Victorian London where none was recorded. The main character's experiences in the theatrical profession and her perpetual motion through the city allow her to make observations on social conditions while exploring the issues of gender, sexism, and class difference.|$|E

25|$|During {{her last}} days in office, Clarkson's {{popularity}} with the Armed Forces was {{expressed in a}} large farewell ceremony mounted by the military; the first ever such send-off for a governor general. Similarly, {{on the morning of}} September 26, 2005, Clarkson attended a celebration on Parliament Hill in which members of parliament thanked her for her work and presented her with the viceregal flag that flew atop the Peace Tower when Clarkson was present in parliament. Then, following tradition, Clarkson and Saul planted on Rideau Hall's grounds, two ceremonial trees (swamp white oaks) to mark the end of the former's time in office, and the next day, Clarkson's time as vicereine ended when her successor, Michaëlle Jean, was sworn in as Governor General of Canada. However, Clarkson caused yet another controversy <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>decided,</b> with Jean's consent, to attend Jean's investiture, marking {{the first time in more}} than a century that a governor general had attended the swearing-in of his or her successor.|$|E
25|$|Hurd-Wood {{attended}} Rodborough Technology College in Milford, Surrey from 2001 to 2006 for her GCSEs with Art, English Literature, Psychology and Philosophy as subjects. She had tutored lessons {{during the}} filming of Peter Pan in Australia during 2002 to 2003 as her work lasted for a span of 8 to 9 months. She later attended sixth-form Godalming College from 2006 to 2008 to study for her GCE Advanced Levels with Art, Psychology and Philosophy as subjects. Hurd-Wood had considered becoming a marine biologist because of her love for dolphins. She gave up on the idea when she discovered that it would require studying science because {{she thought she was}} not very good at it. She became interested in working with children who have special needs or disabilities. Hurd-Wood studied linguistics from 2008 at University College London, having completed her first year in 2009, but left the course incomplete before travelling to Australia for the filming of Tomorrow, When the War Began, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>decided</b> to focus entirely on her career in acting.|$|E
500|$|Pollin finds no {{evidence}} that Imlay had been refused a position at her aunts' school, only that such a scheme may have been [...] "in contemplation", as Godwin later wrote, although Seymour grants this explanation some plausibility. St Clair claims that Imlay {{was on her way}} to join her maternal aunts in Ireland <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>decided</b> to commit suicide. He believes that it was to be a probationary visit, to see if she could be a teacher in their school. Godwin's modern biographer, Richard Holmes, dismisses this story.|$|E

500|$|Initially, {{the chief}} villain, Hugo Drax, {{was to be}} played by British actor James Mason, but once the {{decision}} was made that the film would be an Anglo-French co-production under the 1965–79 film treaty, French actor Michael Lonsdale was cast as Drax and Corinne Cléry was chosen for the part of Corinne Dufour, to comply with qualifying criteria of the agreement. Stewart Granger [...] and Louis Jourdan was considered also for the role of Drax. [...] Jourdan later portrayed prince Kamal Khan, chief villain of Octopussy. American actress Lois Chiles had originally been offered the role of Anya Amasova in The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), but had turned down the part <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>decided</b> to take temporary retirement. Chiles was cast as Holly Goodhead by chance, when she was given the seat next to Lewis Gilbert on a flight and he believed she would be ideal for the role as the CIA scientist.|$|E
500|$|On 15 December 2008, {{recording}} company Polydor officially {{announced that}} [...] "Si j'avais au moins..." [...] {{as the next}} single from the album Point de suture (2008) while simultaneously a promotional format was released on radio stations. This format contained a radio edit version, in which the last refrain of the original song, before the musical bridge, was deleted. Many fans were disappointed by this choice, {{as demonstrated by the}} results of a survey published on the website Mylene.net which showed that only 1.7% of the voters wanted the song as the third single. Charles Decant of Ozap deemed this release a [...] "surprising decision" [...] which recalled the choice of the ballad [...] "Redonne-moi" [...] as the third single from her previous album Avant que l'ombre... (2005). As the song has a very slow tempo, author Erwan Chuberre deemed that Farmer made [...] "an artistic rather than a commercial choice" [...] <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>decided</b> to release the song as a single.|$|E
500|$|... "Cosas del Amor" [...] {{was written}} by Roberto Livi and Rudy Pérez, {{performed}} by American singer Vikki Carr and included on the album of the same title, Carr's fourteenth Spanish language studio album and thirty-third overall.

Carr recorded Cosas del Amor {{under the guidance of}} Roberto Livi in 1991, and was released a year after her duet album with Mexican singer Vicente Fernández which gave the singer her second top ten single in the Billboard Latin Songs chart with [...] "Dos Corazones" [...] ("Two Hearts") peaking at number ten. The first single released was recorded in a duet with Mexican singer-songwriter Ana Gabriel, who was also signed on Carr's record label Sony Music.

[...] Before the tour began, Forbes reported that concert promoter SFX Entertainment guaranteed her a minimum of $200,000 per show. Tour sponsors from the 2000 leg of the ...Baby One More Time Tour, Got Milk?, and Polaroid, remained. Clairol's Herbal Essences was also added as a sponsor.

500|$|The travel motif is a {{recurring}} theme in Traveling Shoes, as evidenced in the book's title, but Angelou's primary motivation in living in Africa, as she told interviewer George Plimpton, was [...] "trying to get home". Angelou not only related her own journey of an African-American woman searching for a home, but the journeys of other Black expatriates at the time, whom McPherson compared to the descriptions of white expatriates in Europe in the 1920s by Ernest Hemingway and Henry James. Angelou's issues were resolved {{at the end of}} Traveling Shoes <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>decided</b> to return to America. She called her departure a [...] "second leave-taking", and compared it to the last time she left her son with his grandmother in Singin' and Swingin' when he was a child, and to the forced departure from Africa by her ancestors. As Lupton states, [...] "Angelou's journey from Africa back to America is in certain ways a restatement of the historical phase known as mid-passage, when slaves were brutally transported in ships from West Africa to the so-called New World". Even though Angelou's final autobiography A Song Flung Up to Heaven took place in her home country, the travel motif continued. [...] Reviewer Patricia Elam described Song as a [...] "journey through an authentic and artistic life".|$|E
500|$|From a young age, Lopez's Puerto Rican parents {{stressed}} the importance of work ethic and being able to speak English. They encouraged their three daughters to put on performances at home, singing and dancing in front of each other and their friends so that they would stay [...] "out of trouble". While attending her final year of high school, Lopez learned about a film casting that was seeking several teenage girls for small roles. She auditioned and was cast in My Little Girl (1986), an low-budget film co-written and directed by Connie Kaiserman. After she finished filming her role in the film, Lopez knew that she wanted to become a [...] "famous movie star". She told her parents this, but they ensisted that it was a [...] "really stupid" [...] idea and that [...] "no Latinos did that". Their disagreements led Lopez to move out of their family home and into an apartment in Manhattan. During this period, Lopez performed in regional productions of several musicals, before being hired for the chorus in a musical that toured Europe for five months. She was unhappy with the role, as she was {{the only member of the}} chorus not to have a solo. From there, she got a job on the show Synchronicity in Japan, where she acted as a dancer, singer and a choreographer. Lopez then gained her first regular high-profile job as a Fly Girl dancer on the television comedy program In Living Color. She moved to Los Angeles with then-boyfriend David Cruz to film the series and remained a regular cast member until 1993 <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>decided</b> to pursue a full-time acting career.|$|E
