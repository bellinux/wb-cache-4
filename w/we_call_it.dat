25|$|In England, {{during the}} Elizabethan and Jacobean eras, any {{stringed}} keyboard instrument was {{often described as}} a virginals, and could equally apply to a harpsichord or possibly even a clavichord or spinet. Thus, the masterworks of William Byrd and his contemporaries were often played on full-size, Italian or Flemish harpsichords, and {{not only on the}} virginals as <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> today. Contemporary nomenclature often referred to a pair of virginals, which implied a single instrument, possibly a harpsichord with two registers, or a double virginals (see below).|$|E

500|$|A {{few days}} before the opening of the 1943 season, Stengel was hit by a vehicle while {{crossing}} Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, and he severely fractured a leg. He missed the first two months of the season, receiving many well-wishers, and reading get-well cards jokingly misaddressed to the hospital's psychiatric ward. For the rest of his life, Stengel walked with a limp. At the end of the season, Braves management, tired of minimal progress, fired Stengel, and he received no immediate job offers. Stengel testified about this part of his career before a Senate subcommittee fifteen years later, [...] "I became a major league manager in several cities and was discharged. <b>We</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> discharged because there is no question I had to leave." ...|$|E
500|$|The Sun is {{like fire}} and the Moon like water. [...] The fire gives out light and the water {{reflects}} it. Thus the moon's brightness is produced from the radiance of the Sun, and the Moon's darkness is due to (the light of) the sun being obstructed. The side which faces the Sun is fully lit, and the side which is away from it is dark. The planets (as well as the Moon) have the nature of water and reflect light. The light pouring forth from the Sun does not always reach the moon owing to the obstruction of the earth itself—this is called 'an-xu', a lunar eclipse. When (a similar effect) happens with a planet (<b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>it)</b> an occultation; when the Moon passes across (the Sun's path) {{then there is a}} solar eclipse.|$|E

In 1995 she told BBC Radio Merseyside: [...] "Our philosophy then, because we were only little kids, was wearing black clothes and going around looking moody. Of course, we hadn't a clue who Jean-Paul Sartre was. We got inspired by all the French artists and writers, because that was the closest we could get. England was so far away, and America was out of the question. So France was the nearest. So we got all the information from France, and we tried to dress like the French existentialists... We wanted to be free, we wanted to be different, and tried to be cool, as <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> now." ...|$|E

500|$|The German word [...] "Achtung" [...] (...) in {{the album}} title {{translates}} into English as [...] "attention" [...] or [...] "watch out". U2's sound engineer Joe O'Herlihy {{used the phrase}} [...] "achtung baby" [...] during recording, reportedly taking it from the Mel Brooks film The Producers. The title was selected in August 1991 {{near the end of}} the album sessions. According to Bono, it was an ideal title, as it was attention-grabbing, referenced Germany, and hinted at either romance or birth, both of which were themes on the album. The band was determined not to highlight the seriousness of the lyrics and instead sought to [...] "erect a mask", a concept that was further developed on the Zoo TV Tour, particularly through characters such as [...] "The Fly". Of the title, Bono said in 1992, [...] "It's a con, in a way. <b>We</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> Achtung Baby, grinning up our sleeves in all the photography. But it's probably the heaviest record we've ever made... It tells you a lot about packaging, because the press would have killed us if we'd called it anything else." ...|$|E

The band spent {{a large amount of}} time rehearsing the songs to get the best takes possible. Gossard commented that there was more [...] "contouring" [...] and [...] "honing" [...] of demo {{material}} than on previous records. Regarding the recording sessions, drummer Jack Irons said, [...] "We didn't put any time limit on it. It was like, 'When this record's done, <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a record.' We took out time to come up with ideal sounds and feel for every song, so that each had its own identity. We would cut a track and go back and listen to it and openly discuss it." [...] Ament stated that [...] "Yield was a superfun record to make. And so much of it was Ed kind of sitting back." [...] He added that [...] "everybody really {{got a little bit of}} their say on the record...because of that, everybody feels like they're an integral part of the band."
