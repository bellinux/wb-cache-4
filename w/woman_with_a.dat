Gilbert and Sullivan added the element of the comic patter-singing character. With the success of H.M.S.

Before The Sorcerer, Gilbert had constructed his plays around the established stars of whatever theatre he happened to be writing for, as had been the case with Thespis and Trial by Jury. Building on the team he had assembled for The Sorcerer, Gilbert no longer hired stars; he created them. He and Sullivan selected the performers, writing their operas for ensemble casts rather than individual stars.|$|E

There {{is a need for}} {{a better understanding of the}} underlying mechanisms for a better diagnosis and treatment of <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ASD, because they are good in hiding the characteristics of an ASD. The current study compares different aspects of social cognition between <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high functioning ASD and typical developed (TD) women through <b>a</b> comparison between <b>women</b> <b>with</b> and without <b>an</b> ASD. This comparison is based on their performance of social cognition tasks and through <b>a</b> comparison between <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ASD mutually based on their reflectivity. A total of 31 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ASD and 30 TD women participated in this study. The prosody task of the ANT was used for recognition of basic emotions. For the visual emotion recognition the Facial Expression Recognition task was used. The informant list of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index was used to get the various aspects of empathy in daily life. The Dewey Social Story test was used for an impression of perspective taking and understanding of usual and unusual social situations. Results show that <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ASD have more difficulty with perspective taking and in understanding of other people’s mental states. Although <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ASD perform similar to TD women in recognizing the basic emotions, <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ASD perform worse when these emotions are showed <b>with</b> low intensity. <b>Women</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ASD are also slower in recognizing all basic emotions.

40|$|Background: Results from {{a number}} of {{long-term}} follow-up studies have suggested that hypertensive disorders in pregnancy are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease later in life. More recently, this putative relationship has been substantiated with findings of elevated cardiovascular risk factors, such as lipid profiles and glucose, in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> history of hypertensive pregnancy disorders. Homocysteine is a sensitive indicator of increased risk but data on homocysteine levels in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> history of hypertensive pregnancy disorders are inconsistent. Design: This cohort study included 279 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> history of hypertensive pregnancy disorders at term and 85 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> history of uncomplicated pregnancies who participated in the Hypitat Risk Assessment Study (HyRAS). Methods: Blood samples for total homocysteine determination were taken 2. 5 years postpartum. Homocysteine levels were determined in plasma using <b>an</b> immunoassay. Results: <b>Women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> history of hypertensive pregnancy disorders had significant higher median homo- cysteine levels (10. 66 l mol/L) 2. 5 years postpartum compared <b>with</b> <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> history uncomplicated pregnancies (9. 82 l mol/L; p = 0. 002). <b>Women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> history of hypertensive pregnancy disorders had a higher risk of having a homocysteine level in the highest quartile (odds ratio 3. 4, 95 % confidence interval 1. 5 – 7. 6). Conclusion: At 2. 5 years postpartum, <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> history hypertensive pregnancy disorders had higher homocysteine levels than women who had uncomplicated pregnancies. Although higher homocysteine levels might be a potential link between a history of hypertensive pregnancy disorders and increased cardiovascular disease risk later in life, the clinical implications remain an area for future research.

5|$|Many of the {{characters}} from the graphic novel underwent significant changes for the film. V is characterized in the film as a romantic freedom fighter who shows concern {{over the loss of}} innocent life. However, in the graphic novel, he is portrayed as ruthless, willing to kill anyone who gets in his way. Evey Hammond's transformation as V's protégée is also much more drastic in the novel than in the film. At the beginning of the film, she is already a confident <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hint of rebellion in her; in the graphic novel, she starts off as an insecure, desperate young woman forced into prostitution. V and Evey's relationship, though not as obvious in the book, ends in the film with pledges of love. In the graphic novel's finale, she not only carries out V's plans as she does in the film, but also clearly takes on V's identity. In the film, Inspector Finch sympathizes with V, but, in the graphic novel, he is determined to stop V and goes as far as taking LSD to enter into a criminal's state of mind. Gordon, a very minor character in both adaptations, is also drastically changed. In the novel, Gordon is a small-time criminal who takes Evey into his home after V abandons her on the street. The two share a brief romance before Gordon is killed by a Scottish gang. In the film, however, Gordon is a well-mannered colleague of Evey's, and is later revealed to be gay. He is arrested by fingermen for broadcasting a political parody on his TV program, and is later executed when a Quran is found in his possession.|$|E
5|$|Shtriga is a vampiric witch in {{traditional}} Albanian folklore that sucks {{the blood of}} infants at night while they sleep, and then turns into a flying insect (traditionally a moth, fly or bee). Only the shtriga herself could cure those she had drained. The shtriga is often pictured as a <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hateful stare (sometimes wearing a cape) and a horribly disfigured face. The male noun for shtriga is shtrigu or shtrigan. Edith Durham recorded several methods traditionally considered effective for defending oneself from shtriga. A cross made of pig bone could be placed {{at the entrance of}} a church on Easter Sunday, rendering any shtriga inside unable to leave. They could then be captured and killed at the threshold as they vainly attempted to pass. She further recorded the story that after draining blood from a victim, the shtriga would generally go off into the woods and regurgitate it. If a silver coin were to be soaked in that blood and wrapped in cloth, it would become an amulet offering permanent protection from any shtriga.|$|E
5|$|The Aboriginal group {{forms the}} inner centre {{piece in the}} tondo of both bowls. As the same image was used for both bowls, the {{implication}} is that the Chinese ceramic painters were copying from the same drawing and finishing them at the same place and time. The image is of a group of four Aboriginal men with club, shield and spears, one <b>woman</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> baby on her shoulders – standing and turned slightly away {{from the rest of the}} figures – and another woman cowed by the men. This is thought to depict a preliminary marriage ceremony. As with the Museum bowl's Sydney Cove image, no directly related, surviving, version is known that would have been used by the ceramic artists to paint the Aboriginal group. The closest match is a drawing after an apparently now-lost original sketch by Nicolas-Martin Petit, artist on the 1800–1803 French expedition to Australia led by Nicolas Baudin. Research made around 2009–2012, indicated that during Baudin's expedition, a report was prepared for Emperor Napoleon on the feasibility of capturing the British colony at Sydney Cove. As this expedition progressed around coastal Australia, Petit began to specialise in the drawing of portraits of indigenous peoples. The French expedition arrived at Port Jackson on 25April 1802. Petit's drawing was copied for publication as plate 114 in the Voyage autour du monde : entrepris par ordre du roi (Paris, 1825) , regarding a voyage around the world (1817–1820) led by Louis-Claude de Saulces de Freycinet. The engraving is entitled Port Jackson, Nlle Hollande. Ceremonie preliminaire d'un mariage, chez les sauvages (ceremony before a marriage among the natives, Port Jackson, New Holland). Port Jackson aborigines are from the Eora group of indigenous people living in the Sydney Basin.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} {{pregnancy}} outcomes of <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dichorionic triamniotic triplet pregnancy that {{was reduced to}} a singleton pregnancy and to review the literature. METHODS: We performed a nationwide retrospective cohort study. We compared time to delivery and perinatal mortality in dichorionic triplet pregnancies reduced to singletons with ongoing dichorionic triplet pregnancies and primary singleton pregnancies. Additionally, we reviewed the literature on the subject. RESULTS: We studied 46 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> reduced dichorionic triplet pregnancy and 42 <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ongoing dichorionic triplet pregnancy. Median gestational age at delivery was 38. 7 vs. 32. 8 weeks, respectively (p < 0. 001). Delivery < 24 weeks occurred in 9 (19. 6 %) <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> reduced triplet pregnancy and 4 (9. 5 %) <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ongoing triplet pregnancy (p = 0. 19). Perinatal survival rates between the reduced group and the ongoing triplet group were not significantly different. CONCLUSION: Multifetal pregnancy reduction in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dichorionic triplet pregnancy to a singleton pregnancy prolongs median gestational age at birth. No statistically significant association was found with miscarriage and perinatal survival rates...|$|R
40|$|Aims. : There {{is limited}} {{longitudinal}} {{research that has}} looked at the longer term incidence of depressive symptoms, comparing <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hysterectomy to <b>women</b> without a hysterectomy. We aimed to investigate the association between hysterectomy status and the 12 -year incidence of depressive symptoms in a mid-aged cohort of Australian women, and whether these relationships were modified by use of exogenous hormones. Methods. : We used generalised estimating equation models for binary outcome data to assess the associations of the incidence of depressive symptoms (measured by the 10 -item Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale) across five surveys over a 12 -year period, in <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hysterectomy <b>with</b> ovarian conservation, or <b>a</b> hysterectomy <b>with</b> bilateral oophorectomy compared <b>with</b> <b>women</b> without <b>a</b> hysterectomy. We further stratified <b>women</b> <b>with</b> hysterectomy by their current use of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT). Women who reported prior treatment for depression {{were excluded from the}} analysis. Results. : Compared <b>with</b> <b>women</b> without <b>a</b> hysterectomy (n = 4002), both <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hysterectomy <b>with</b> ovarian conservation (n = 884) and <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy (n = 450) had a higher risk of depressive symptoms (relative risk (RR) 1. 20; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 06 – 1. 36 and RR 1. 44; 95 % CI 1. 22 – 1. 68, respectively). There were differences in the strength of the risk for <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hysterectomy <b>with</b> ovarian conservation, compared with those without, when we stratified by current MHT use. Compared <b>with</b> <b>women</b> without <b>a</b> hysterectomy who did not use MHT, <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hysterectomy <b>with</b> ovarian conservation who were also MHT users had a higher risk of depressive symptoms (RR 1. 57; 95 % CI 1. 31 – 1. 88) than <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hysterectomy <b>with</b> ovarian conservation but did not use MHT (RR 1. 17; 95 % CI 1. 02 – 1. 35). For <b>women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy, MHT use did not attenuate the risk. We could not rule out, however, that the higher risk seen among MHT users may be due to confounding by indication, i. e. MHT was prescribed to treat depressive symptoms, but their depressive symptoms persisted. Conclusions. : <b>Women</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hysterectomy (<b>with</b> and without bilateral oophorectomy) have a higher risk of new incidence of depressive symptoms in the longer term that was not explained by lifestyle or socio-economic factors...|$|R
