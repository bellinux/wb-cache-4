Hillary Clinton {{said that she}} and Bill {{came out of the}} White House financially [...] "broke" [...] and in debt, especially due to large legal fees incurred during their years in the White House. [...] "We had no money <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> and we struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea's education." [...] She added, [...] "Bill has worked really hard... we had to pay off all our debts... he had to make double the money because of, obviously, taxes; and then pay off the debts, and get us houses, and take care of family members." ...|$|E
500|$|Following their Edinburgh Fringe shows, {{the group}} enjoyed {{considerable}} {{success in the}} United Kingdom, making appearances on numerous BBC comedy shows. In 1988, the group was nominated for the Perrier Comedy Award for their performances at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Fidler says that the British people were more receptive to their act at the time than Australians had been. [...] "The whole thing exploded for us <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> it was quite incredible. Within {{a very short time}} we were doing national television appearances in front of millions of people and playing these enormous shows," [...] he says. They played extensively in Canada, Germany, America and Britain, and finished their time in Britain by appearing on the final episode of the successful Friday Night Live. However, despite the acclaim they were receiving overseas, when they returned to Australia at the end of 1988 they remained unknown. Upon arriving in Melbourne, they struggled to gain a following and went back to busking on the streets.|$|E
2500|$|The Dust Brothers had a {{bunch of}} music {{together}}, before we arrived to work with them. As a result, a lot of the tracks come from songs they'd planned to release to clubs as instrumentals – [...] "Shake Your Rump," [...] for example. They'd put together some beats, basslines and guitar lines, all these loops together, and they were quite surprised when we said we wanted to rhyme on it, because they thought it was too dense. They offered to strip it down to just beats, but we wanted all of that stuff on there. I think half of the tracks were written <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> and the other half we wrote together." ...|$|E

2500|$|Comey also {{testified that}} Ashcroft [...] "expressed himself in very strong terms." [...] Goldsmith testified that Ashcroft spoke {{at length about}} the legal issue. [...] "Attorney General Ashcroft… [...] a couple of minutes' speech {{in which he said}} that he…. shared the Justice department's concerns." [...] Although he was not present for the {{conversation}} between Gonzales and Ashcroft, FBI Director Bob Mueller testified, [...] "Ashcroft complained to Judge Gonzales about White House compartmentalization rules preventing Ashcroft from getting the advice he needed." [...] On July 24, 2007, Gonzales testified that he and Card were also concerned about Ashcroft's competency. [...] "Obviously there was concern about General Ashcroft's condition. [...] And we would not have sought nor did we intend to get any approval from General Ashcroft if in fact he wasn't fully competent to make the decision." [...] In response to a question from Senator Hatch, Gonzales continued, [...] "Obviously we were concerned about the condition of General Ashcroft. [...] We obviously knew he had been ill and had surgery. [...] And we never had any intent to ask anything of him if we did not feel that he was competent. [...] <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> I will just say that Mr. Ashcroft did most of the talking. [...] We were there maybe five minutes – five to six minutes. [...] Mr. Ashcroft talked about the legal issues in a lucid form, as I've heard him talk about legal issues in the White House.|$|E

5000|$|I saw {{the most}} gruesome sight I’ve ever seen. Lying on a blood stained brancard was a man—not older than twenty I {{afterwards}} ascertained—suffering the agonies of hell. His whole right cheek was completely shot away {{so you could}} see all the insides of his face. He had no jaws, teeth, or lips left. His nose was plastered in. Blood was streaming all over. Under his eyes the skin was just dead blue.... It took us an hour driving between two or three miles per hour to get him to his destination. Of course he couldn’t yell as his mouth or what was left of it was a mere mass of pulp. For a while I was afraid our ambulance was to be turned into a hearse, but he was still alive <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> him <b>there.</b> Of course in typical French fashion the doctors held their usual debate of questioning whether it was the right hospital or where his papers were.|$|R

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the difference in}} top managers' strategic cognition of the strategy making process in high and low performing firms. At the heart of every organizational success lies a well crafted strategy of where are we now, where {{do we want to}} go, how do we get there, and how do <b>we</b> know <b>when</b> <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>there.</b> This article presents the latest findings on how top managers [...] boards of directors and top management team members [...] in high and low performing firms describe their strategy making experiences. The similarities and differences found are quite intriguing and useful for any senior executives involved with the strategic direction of their organisations. A Repertory Grid Technique was chosen to elicit top managers' strategic thinking in this article because it was known to be a powerful, rigorous and systematic interviewing approach to discover how people construe and make sense of their worlds. This interviewing technique basically consists of three aspects: elements, constructs and ratings. Department of Management and Marketin...|$|R

5000|$|On 20 September 1915, he was {{transferred}} to the casualty clearing station at Corbie, located in a former bicycle factory. As well as his spiritual work, he helped feed and dress the wounded patients. His first period of leave since enlisting came in November, when he spent a week home, before returning to the front. On his return passage, he was shipped from Southampton on a crowded troop ship. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> on board <b>there</b> wasn’t a seat to be had, and not much lying down room on the floor.

6000|$|There was {{genius in}} his house, too, I thought, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> there; <b>there</b> was {{imagination}} in the carpets and curtains, {{in the pictures}} and books, in the garden behind it, where certain old brown walls were muffled in creepers that appeared to me to have been copied from a masterpiece {{of one of the}} pre-Raphaelites. That was the way many things struck me at that time, in England; as if they were reproductions of something that existed primarily in art or literature. It was not the picture, the poem, the fictive page, that seemed to me a copy; these things were the originals, and the life of happy and distinguished people was fashioned in their image. Mark Ambient called his house a cottage, and I perceived afterwards that he was right; for {{if it had not been}} a cottage it must have been a villa, and a villa, in England at least, was not a place in which one could fancy him at home. But it was, to my vision, a cottage glorified and translated; it was a palace of art, on a slightly reduced scale,--it was an old English demesne. It nestled under a cluster of magnificent beeches, it had little creaking lattices that opened out of, or into, pendent mats of ivy, and gables, and old red tiles, as well as a general aspect of being painted in water-colors and inhabited by people whose lives would go on in chapters and volumes. The lawn seemed to me of extraordinary extent, the garden-walls of incalculable height, the whole air of the place delightfully still, private, proper to itself. [...] "My wife must be somewhere about," [...] Mark Ambient said, as we went in. [...] "We shall find her perhaps; <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> about an hour before dinner. She may be in the garden. I will show you my little place." ...|$|R

Beyond that, the men {{had been able to}} gather no news whatever of the carriage. The country was a desert, tenanted only by dead; and the men's descriptions of what they saw were so horrible that my blood was frozen. However, I kept on my journey, taking them with me. We went to the post-house where the carriage had last stopped, and then took up the search. There were half a dozen roads by which they might have proceeded; however, we took the most easterly one, and then, when it crossed the main road, followed the latter. It was choked with deserted waggons and guns. Dead bodies lay everywhere; many partly devoured by wolves; all stripped of their clothing. After making our way through this terrible scene for a few miles, we saw, fifty yards from the road, the remains of a sleigh. Its bright yellow colour caught our eyes, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to it <b>there</b> was no room for doubt. The body of the sleigh was gone--had been burnt for firewood; but the colour was that of my own carriage, and two of the men who belonged to the stables at Kieff said that they could swear to it, owing to a new iron that had been put on to one of the runners the day before it had started. But there were other signs. Portions of the harness lay about, and on one of these enough of the silver-work remained to show that it was ours.|$|R
5000|$|Touchdown {{finally took}} place at 16:04:46 UTC on 30 March 1982, at Northrop Strip. STS-3 was the only shuttle mission to land at White Sands. The final {{approach}} was in part flown by the shuttle's autopilot, but the autoland program was not complete, {{and it was not}} meant to be an automatic landing. Rolling out on final, the autopilot was reengaged, and responded by closing the speedbrakes (despite the orbiter being on profile), resulting in increased speed. The autopilot then commanded full speedbrakes, and kept oscillating like this for some time. Lousma left the autopilot activated in order to gather data on its behavior, but disconnected it again at a very late stage to touch down manually. The landing {{was also one of the}} more dramatic of the program, with the landing gear deploying at an altitude of 150 ft at a speed of 275 kn and locking just five seconds before touchdown, and the nose being raised again right before nose-gear touchdown. Lousma did not know that the autoland system was still partially engaged until Fullerton warned him, causing Lousma to pitch up; Charles F. Bolden, who had worked on the autoland system early in his astronaut career, stated in 2004 that [...] "he saved the vehicle" [...] by doing so. The unexpectedly difficult landing damaged the shuttle, requiring extensive repair at KSC. So much gypsum dust covered Columbia that Bolden recalled, [...] "I flew it several flights later on my first flight and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> on orbit, <b>there</b> was still gypsum coming out of everything! They thought they had cleaned it … but it was just unreal what it had done!" [...] Dust continued to be found in the spacecraft for the rest of its career.|$|R

What follows? The risk of keeping him forcibly in concealment--of suppressing him, if I may so express myself--increases at compound interest, and becomes Enormous! My house is at this moment virtually ready for patients. Patients may present themselves in a week's time. Patients may communicate with Mr. Armadale, or Mr. Armadale may communicate with patients. A note may be smuggled out of the house, and may reach the Commissioners in Lunacy. Even {{in the case of}} an unlicensed establishment like mine, those gentlemen--no! those chartered despots in a land of liberty--have only to apply to the Lord Chancellor for an order, and to enter (by heavens, to enter My Sanitarium!) and search the house from top to bottom at a moment's notice!
