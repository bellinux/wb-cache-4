5|$|Leo's {{election}} {{was seen as}} a victory for France, with supporters of the French celebrating in Rome's streets upon his election. Leo's election pleased the French, because he was a relative of Marie de' Medici who was happy with his election. Leo's reign, however, <b>was</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> month of April 1605. He caught a cold while appearing in public, and died on 27 April 1605, twenty-six days after his election.|$|E

5|$|Agricola's successors {{were unable}} or unwilling to further subdue the far north. The {{fortress}} at Inchtuthil was dismantled before its completion, and the other fortifications of the Gask Ridge were abandoned within the space of a few years. By CE 87 the occupation <b>was</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Southern Uplands, {{and by the end of}} the first century the northern limit of Roman expansion was a line drawn between the Tyne and Solway Firth. Elginhaugh fort, in Midlothian, dates to about this period, as may Castle Greg in West Lothian. The Romans eventually withdrew to a line in what is now northern England, building the fortification known as Hadrian's Wall from coast to coast.|$|E
5|$|Due to the coyote's {{wide range}} and {{abundance}} throughout North America, it {{is listed as}} least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The coyote's pre-Columbian range <b>was</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Southwest and Plains regions of the United States and Canada, and northern and central Mexico. By the 19th century, the species expanded north and east, expanding further after 1900, coinciding with land conversion and the extirpation of wolves. By this time, its range encompassed all of the United States and Mexico, southward into Central America, and northward into most of Canada and Alaska. This expansion is ongoing, and the species now occupies the majority of areas between 8°N (Panama) and 70°N (northern Alaska).|$|E
5|$|Following the Constitution of May 3, 1791, the senate's competences were altered; in {{most cases}} the {{senators}} could only vote together with the sejm, and the senate's veto powers were limited. Legislative power <b>was</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> deputies of the sejm (not senators voting separately, except on the senate's privilege of veto, a suspension of a given legislation until the sejm votes on it again during the next session). The king, who nominated senators, ministers and other officials, presided over the senate, and could propose new laws together with the executive government, over which he also presided (the newly created Straż Praw or the Guardianship of Laws). The sejm also had the supervisory role, as government ministers and other officials were to be responsible to it.|$|E

5|$|Meerkat Manor {{was created}} by Caroline Hawkins, {{executive}} producer and series editor at Oxford Scientific Films, and commissioned for Animal Planet International by executive producer and commissioning editor Mark Wild. Filming for a 13-episode series took seven to eight months, and <b>was</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kalahari spring and summer seasons, as meerkats are less active during winter. Series three was filmed from November 2006 through April 2007, and Series four began filming in October 2007. Most scenes were filmed on location at the Kuruman River Reserve, where the Kalahari Meerkat Project that the meerkats {{are a part of}} is based. However, the meerkats seen in commercials and on the show's website were not the same animals portrayed in Meerkat Manor. Instead, tamer-rescued meerkats from the Fellow Earthlings' Wildlife Center were filmed against a green screen.|$|E

The company released recovery media and instructions {{which could be used}} to repair the device, and restored access to Windows RT 8.1 the next day.|$|E
5|$|The Old Curiosity Shop is a 1911 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film is an adaptation of The Old Curiosity Shop by Charles Dickens that <b>was</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> time constrictions of the single reel format. The film focuses on the grandfather who gambles into poverty and the consequences which eventually claim the life of Little Nell. Its survival and attribution as a Thanhouser film was noted by Kamilla Elliott in her 2003 book Rethinking the Novel/Film Debate under the title Little Nell. In 2012, the work was confirmed to be a Thanhouser production at the Pordenone Silent Film Festival. The identification of the film as Little Nell arose due to head of the film having been lost.|$|E

5|$|The Singapore National Library traces {{its roots}} to Sir Stamford Raffles, {{the founder of}} modern Singapore, who in 1823 started a small private {{collection}} of books housed in the Raffles Institution. This was known as Raffles Library, {{and access to the}} collection <b>was</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British and privileged class. Dr. Robert Morrison, an eminent missionary and educator became the first librarian from 1823 to 1845. He was mainly responsible for establishing the plans with Raffles and soliciting book donations for the Library. When it was first built, it has a red-brick façade.|$|E
5|$|Until 2009 {{the wearing}} of Boat Club Jackets (ivory with navy blue piping and cuff rings, bearing the three ostrich feather emblem on the left breast) <b>was</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1st and 2nd Summer VIII's and Torpids and the Oriel College Boat Club Committee.

These now {{obsolete}} designations can still seen at the Walters of Oxford website.|$|E
5|$|Although the VC held {{a greater}} {{portion of the}} Ngok Tavak garrison, {{particularly}} on the eastern side, their attack was stalled. After the 40th Battalion had overrun the command post, they tried to advance on the landing zone where allied soldiers {{had set up a}} strong position from fortified underground bunkers, which the VC had failed to detect in their previous reconnaissance patrols. At 04:20, an AC-47 gunship from the 4th Air Commando Squadron was reported to be flying over the garrison, so White directed the aircraft to fire down on VC-held positions around the perimeter. After he had shouted warnings to the Marines and the Nungs, White approved the aircraft to fire on the position area of the 105mm howitzers. The arrival of the AC-47 enabled the allied forces to hold their last remaining ground, and repulse the final attack. By 05:30, fighting in and around Ngok Tavak <b>was</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hurling of grenades, and random fire on any movement that was believed to be that of the VC. In one of their final attempts to overcome the last allied position, the VC set off tear gas of such low density that it had little effect on most of the allied soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the notorious}} laxity of the South Vietnamese {{military}} {{when it came}} to security precautions and the uncanny ability of communist agents to uncover operational information, the planning phase lasted only a few weeks and was divided between the American and Vietnamese high commands. At the lower levels, it <b>was</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> intelligence and operational staffs of ARVN's I Corps, under Lieutenant General Hoàng Xuân Lãm, who was to command the operation, and the XXIV Corps, headed by General Sutherland. When Lãm was finally briefed by MACV and the South Vietnamese Joint General Staff in Saigon, his chief of operations was forbidden to attend the meeting, even though he had helped to write the very plan under discussion. At this meeting, Lãm's operational area was restricted to a corridor no wider than 15 miles on either side of Route 9 and a penetration no deeper than Tchepone.|$|E
5|$|During {{his tenure}} as {{principal}} of Comilla Victoria College, Khan developed {{a special interest in}} grassroots actions. Between 1954 and 1955, he took a break to work as director of the Village Agricultural and Industrial Development (V-AID) Programme. However, he was not satisfied with the development approach adopted in the programme that <b>was</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> training of villagers. In 1958, he went to Michigan State University to acquire education and training in rural development. Returning in 1959, he established the Pakistan Academy for Rural Development (PARD) at Comilla on 27 May 1959 and was appointed as its founding director. He also laid foundations for the Comilla Cooperative Pilot Project in 1959. In 1963, he received a Ramon Magsaysay Award from the Government of the Philippines for his services in rural development. Khan became Vice-chairman of the board of Governors of PARD in 1964, and in the same year, was awarded an honorary Doctorate of law by Michigan State University. In 1969, he delivered a series of lectures at Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University, based on his experience with rural cooperatives. During the visit, he established collaborative links with Arthur Lewis.|$|E
5|$|During his voyage, Cook also visited New Zealand, first {{discovered}} by Dutch explorer Abel Tasman in 1642, and claimed the North and South islands for the British crown in 1769 and 1770 respectively. Initially, {{interaction between the}} indigenous Māori population and Europeans <b>was</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> trading of goods. European settlement increased through {{the early decades of}} the 19th century, with numerous trading stations established, especially in the North. In 1839, the New Zealand Company announced plans to buy large tracts of land and establish colonies in New Zealand. On 6 February 1840, Captain William Hobson and around 40 Maori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi. This treaty is considered by many to be New Zealand's founding document, but differing interpretations of the Maori and English versions of the text have meant that it continues to be a source of dispute.|$|E
