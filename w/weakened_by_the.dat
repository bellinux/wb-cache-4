5|$|Lecter takes Starling to Krendler's secluded lake {{house and}} treats her wounds. When Krendler arrives for the Fourth of July, Lecter subdues and drugs him. Starling, disoriented by {{morphine}} {{and dressed in}} a black velvet evening gown, awakens to find Krendler seated at the table set for an elegant dinner. <b>Weakened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> drugs, she looks on in horror as Lecter removes part of Krendler's prefrontal cortex, sautés it, and feeds it to him.|$|E
5|$|The Muslim siege {{forces had}} been <b>weakened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{withdrawal}} of 9,000 men to repel the Byzantine relief force. If the Byzantine garrison had sallied {{out against the}} Muslim army, historians suspect the defenders would have broken through the Muslim lines and lifted the siege. Understanding {{the danger of the}} situation, Khalid hurriedly returned to Damascus.|$|E
5|$|The Vandals {{were also}} <b>weakened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> hostility of their Roman subjects, the {{continued}} existence among the Vandals of a faction loyal to Hilderic, and by the ambivalent position of the Moorish tribes, who watched the oncoming conflict from the sidelines, ready to join the victor and seize the spoils.|$|E
50|$|Minnesota was {{considered}} a leaning-Carter state, as the Republican Party of Minnesota was terribly <b>weaken</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Watergate scandal, and Jimmy Carter picked Walter Mondale, an incumbent senator from Minnesota.|$|R

5|$|The {{third and}} {{smallest}} group {{are those who}} see through the illusion; they are usually dubbed dangerous or mad. The Red Dress genetic lines interbreed obsessively {{to make sure their}} bloodlines are not <b>weakened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> second or third levels of consciousness, because consciousness can rewrite the software.|$|E
5|$|<b>Weakened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{prolonged}} {{economic downturn}} of the Panic of 1893, the Northern Pacific went bankrupt in October 1893, {{and was forced}} to end its ownership of the Chicago and Northern Pacific, including Grand Central Station. Ultimately, tenant railroad Baltimore and Ohio purchased the station at foreclosure in 1910 along with all the terminal trackage to form the Baltimore and Ohio Chicago Terminal Railroad (B).|$|E
5|$|Acknowledged by Malcolm III {{as part of}} the Kingdom of the Isles, a Norwegian crown dependency, {{from the}} 12th century onwards Norwegian power in the Western Isles <b>weakened.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> 1266 Treaty of Perth they reverted to the Scottish crown control under the tutelage of the quasi-autonomous Lordship of Garmoran (ruled by the MacRory, a faction among the rulers of the Kingdom of the Isles). In 1427, {{following}} violence between the MacRory heirs to Garmoran (Clan Ranald, the Siol Gorrie, and Siol Murdoch), Garmoran was declared forfeit.|$|E

50|$|The ICU captures Bu'alle and Badhadhe {{from the}} JVA on October 15, pushing the JVA out of Lower Juba entirely. Barre Hirale {{attempted}} a final push to recapture Kismayo and Bu'alle through mid October, mustering {{all of his}} forces for a final battle near Kismayo where his forces were defeated, along with a simultaneous attempt to capture Bu'alle. Several of the Marehan subclans had opened their own negotiations with the ICU, and his position was <b>weakening</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> day.|$|R
5|$|Arsenal's {{dominance}} of the decade was sealed with a second FA Cup in 1935–36, winning 1–0 against Sheffield United with a goal from Drake. Arsenal faded in the League somewhat after the 1934–35 title, and were <b>weakened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> retirement of Alex James and the club's inability to replace him, as well as long-term injuries to several other key players such as Herbie Roberts and Joe Hulme. Nevertheless, they won a fifth League title in 1937–38, pipping Wolves {{on the final day}} of the season, to cap off a highly successful decade.|$|E
5|$|Despite the RIRA's renewed activity, the {{organisation}} was <b>weakened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> arrest of key members and continued infiltration by informers. McKevitt {{was arrested on}} 29 March 2001 and charged with membership of an illegal organisation and directing terrorism, and remanded into custody. In July 2001, following the arrests of McKevitt and other RIRA members, British and Irish government sources hinted that {{the organisation}} was now in disarray. Other key figures were jailed, including the RIRA's Director of Operations, Liam Campbell, {{who was convicted of}} membership of an illegal organisation, and Colm Murphy who was convicted of conspiring to cause the Omagh bombing, although this conviction was overturned on appeal.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{commercial}} successes of Terang Boelan (Full Moon; 1937), Fatima (1938), and Alang-Alang (Grass; 1939), the Dutch East Indies film industry– {{which had been}} severely <b>weakened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Great Depression– was revived. Film production increased and, in 1940, four new production houses were opened, including Oriental Film. Funded entirely by the ethnic Chinese businessman Tjo Seng Han, the company's first headquarters were at 42 Matraman Street, in eastern Batavia (now Jakarta); according to the weekly Sin Po, this studio had simple facilities. Another ethnic Chinese businessman, Tjan Hock Siong, was brought on to manage the day-to-day activities of the studio.|$|E

5|$|In 1600, as Russia was {{entering}} {{a period of}} instability, the Commonwealth proposed a union with the Russian state. This failed move was followed by many other similarly unsuccessful, often adventurous attempts, some involving military invasions, other dynastic and diplomatic manipulations and scheming. While {{the differences between the}} two societies and empires proved in the end too formidable to overcome, the Polish–Lithuanian state ended up in 1619, after the Truce of Deulino, with the greatest ever expansion of its territory. At the same time it was <b>weakened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> huge military effort made.|$|E
5|$|Macrinus and his son, <b>weakened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{desertion}} of the Second Legion due to bribes {{and promises}} circulated by Julia Maesa, were defeated on 8 June 218 at the Battle of Antioch by troops commanded by Gannys. Macrinus fled to Italy, {{disguised as a}} courier, but was intercepted near Chalcedon and executed in Cappadocia. His son Diadumenian, sent as a friendly hostage to the Parthian court as a guarantee of peace between the states, was captured at Zeugma and also put to death.|$|E
5|$|Many {{paintings}} can {{be found}} in the museums of Europe depicting tulips with attractive coloured stripes. Most, such as the still life studies of Johannes Bosschaert, were painted during the 17th century. These flowers were particularly popular and became sought after by those who could afford them. At the peak of this tulip mania in the 1630s, one bulb could cost as much as a house. It was not known at the time that the stripes were caused by a virus accidentally transferred by humans to tulips from jasmine. <b>Weakened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> virus, the plants turned out to be a poor investment. Only a few bulbs produced flowers with the attractive characteristics of their parent plants.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, L. Sprague de Camp {{considered}} Morris's fantasies {{to be not}} wholly successful, partly because Morris eschewed many literary techniques from later eras. In particular, De Camp argued the plots of the novels are heavily driven by coincidence; while many things just happened in the romances, the novels are still <b>weakened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> dependence on it. Nevertheless, large subgenres {{of the field of}} fantasy have sprung from the romance genre, but indirectly, through their writers' imitation of William Morris.|$|E
5|$|Summers are hot and humid; {{during this}} season, highs {{average in the}} upper80s °F (lower30s °C) and lows average in the upper60s °F (lower20s °C). The {{combination}} of heat and humidity in the summer brings very frequent thunderstorms, some of which occasionally produce tornadoes in the area. While hurricanes (or their remnants) occasionally track through the area in late summer and early fall, they have often <b>weakened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> time they reach Stephens City, {{partly due to the}} city's far inland location.|$|E
5|$|The Allied defeat {{during the}} Greek Campaign {{indirectly}} {{contributed to a}} change of government in Australia. Prime Minister Menzies' leadership had been <b>weakened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lengthy period he spent in Britain during early 1941, and the high Australian losses in the Greek Campaign led many members of his United Australia Party (UAP) to conclude {{that he was not}} capable of leading the Australian war effort. Menzies resigned on 26 August after losing the confidence of his party and was replaced by Arthur Fadden from the Country Party, which was the UAP's coalition partner. Fadden's government collapsed on 3 October and was replaced by an Australian Labor Party government under the leadership of John Curtin.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{transferring}} responsibility, {{the hurricane}} {{was given the}} name Kanoa, the Hawaiian name meaning [...] "the free one". As the storm approached Hawaii, it began to weaken as convection filled the eye. The storm's track mirrored that of the shipping lane between the Panama Canal and Hawaii, leading to several ships being affected. Colder air also began to enter the circulation, leading to further <b>weakening.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> time the system reached Hawaii, it {{was no more than}} an area of disturbed weather. The remnants of Kanoa persisted until July26, at which time they dissipated over the Hawaiian Islands. The remnants of the storm brought beneficial rainfall to most of Hawaii, with heavy rains being reported in parts of the Big Island.|$|R

5|$|The {{goal of the}} {{operation}} was to secure the vital ports on the French Mediterranean coast and increase pressure on the German forces by opening another front. After some preliminary commando operations, including the British 4th Para's landing behind enemy lines to secure vital transport links, the US VI Corps landed on the beaches of the Côte d'Azur under the shield of a large naval task force, followed by several divisions of the French Army B. They were opposed by the scattered forces of the German Army Group G, which had been <b>weakened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> relocation of its divisions to other fronts and the replacement of its soldiers with third-rate Ostlegionen outfitted with obsolete equipment.|$|E
5|$|The wars {{destroyed}} the old civilian bureaucracy that had governed {{the region for}} centuries, as {{institutions such as the}} audiencias were eliminated and many Peninsular officials fled to Spain. The Catholic Church, which had been an important social and political institution during the colonial period, initially came out <b>weakened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> end of the conflicts. As with government officials, many Peninsular bishops abandoned their dioceses and their posts were not filled for decades until new prelates could be created and relations between the new nations and the Vatican were regularized. Then as the Church recovered, its economic and political power was attacked by liberals.|$|E
5|$|After {{some notable}} successes and some early {{failures}} in the 1920s, the League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the Axis powers in the 1930s. The credibility of the organization was somewhat <b>weakened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that the United States never officially joined the League and the Soviet Union joined late and only briefly. Germany withdrew from the League, as did Japan, Italy, Spain, and others. The onset of the Second World War showed that the League had failed its primary purpose, which was to prevent any future world war. The League lasted for 26 years; the United Nations (UN) replaced it {{after the end of}} the Second World War and inherited several agencies and organisations founded by the League.|$|E
