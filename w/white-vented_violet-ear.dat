40|$|Entropy {{calculations}} {{for measuring}} bird song diversity: The {{case of the}} <b>White-vented</b> <b>Violet-ear</b> (Colibri serrirostris) (Aves, Trochilidae) The <b>White-vented</b> <b>Violet-ear</b> (Colibri serrirostris) is a common and brilliantly colored Brazilian hummingbird that sings a series of high-pitched and evenly spaced short notes with a repertoire size of 3 to 5 note types. We ana-lyzed the song of 17 individuals from 10 localities in relation to note types, repertoire size and non-conditioned and conditioned entropy. Despite the small repertoire size, each singer presented different note types and sequences. Neighbors can share note types, but maintain distinct sequences and entropy values. The entropy values were useful to objectively differentiate between more or less versatile songs with the same repertoire size. Conditioned entropy, a calculation that shows {{the distribution of the}} combinations of two consecutive notes, revealed the more versatile singers, which were not evident from the repertoire size only nor the non-conditioned entropy. Despite the rare pre-sence of note sharing in our sample, we did not find any cue of dialects or geographic patterns of variation, but indi-vidual variation. The variability of C. serrirostris song in note structures, sequences and entropy is evidence of vocal learning and creative capacity, a poorly described communication strategy in non passerine birds...|$|E
