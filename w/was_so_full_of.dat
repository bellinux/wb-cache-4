She and her younger brother Adrian were raised in {{the faith of the}} Romanian Orthodox Church. In a 2011 interview, Nadia's mother Ștefania said that she enrolled her daughter into gymnastics classes simply because she was a child who <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> energy and active that she was difficult to manage. Comăneci graduated from Politehnica University of Bucharest with a degree in sports education that qualified her to coach gymnastics.|$|E
25|$|The Clive Davis's pre-Grammy {{party that}} Houston was {{expected}} to attend, which featured many {{of the biggest names}} in music and movies, went on as scheduled although it was quickly turned into a tribute to Houston. Davis spoke about Houston's death at the evening's start: By now you have all learned of the unspeakably tragic news of our beloved Whitney's passing. I don't have to mask my emotion in front of a room full of so many dear friends. I am personally devastated by the loss of someone who has meant so much to me for so many years. Whitney <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> life. She was so looking forward to tonight even though she wasn't scheduled to perform. Whitney was a beautiful person and a talent beyond compare. She graced this stage with her regal presence and gave so many memorable performances here over the years. Simply put, Whitney would have wanted the music to go on and her family asked that we carry on.|$|E
25|$|The {{final stage}} of the {{compositional}} process was the writing out in ink of a fair copy of the full score (Reinschrift der Partitur). This task was begun by Wagner himself on 15 February 1854, {{while he was still}} at work on the instrumentation draft. It was delayed, however, by his decision to start work on Die Walküre (28 June 1854). Sometime in the summer of 1854 he hired a copyist to make a fair copy in ink of Das Rheingold (using his own unfinished fair copy as a model), but the copyist's work <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> blunders that Wagner was forced to dismiss him and resume work on his own copy. He worked at it on and off for several months, alternating this work with the ongoing composition of Die Walküre. By 25 September 1854 the fair copy of Das Rheingold was finally completed. Wagner then sent it to the Dresden copyist Friedrich Wölfel, who completed a beautiful and very accurate ink copy on 11 November 1855. Wöfel's copy was used as the source-text (Stichvorlage) for the first public printing of the complete opera in 1873.|$|E

500|$|After President John F. Kennedy {{was assassinated}} in , {{his family and friends}} {{discussed}} how to construct a library that would serve as a fitting memorial. A committee was formed to advise Kennedy's widow Jacqueline, who would make the final decision. The group deliberated for months and considered many famous architects. Eventually, Kennedy chose Pei to design the library, based on two considerations. First, she appreciated the variety of ideas he had used for earlier projects. [...] "He didn't seem to have just one way to solve a problem," [...] she said. [...] "He seemed to approach each commission thinking only of it and then develop a way to make something beautiful." [...] Ultimately, however, Kennedy made her choice based on her personal connection with Pei. Calling it [...] "really an emotional decision", she explained: [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> promise, like Jack; they were born in the same year. I decided {{it would be fun to}} take a great leap with him." ...|$|E
500|$|Brian Donlevy as Professor Bernard Quatermass: Donlevy reprised {{his role}} as the eponymous professor, much to the despair of Nigel Kneale, who had heavily criticised his {{interpretation}} of the role in The Quatermass Xperiment. As had been the case on The Quatermass Xperiment, Donlevy's alcoholism presented challenges for the production. Nigel Kneale recalled visiting the set one day: “He [...] <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> whiskey he could hardly stand up. He staggered over to the set and looked dazedly around. They held up an idiot board with his lines on and he said, “What's this movie called?” and they said, “Well, it's called Quatermass 2”. He said, “I've got to say all that? There's too much talk. Cut down some of the talk”. He tried to read it and he had to have go after go after go, so crippled with drink he hardly knew who he was”. Val Guest has denied Kneale's claims, saying “So many stories have been concocted since, about how he was a paralytic. It's absolute balls, because he was not paralytic. He wasn't stone cold sober either, but he was a pro and he knew his lines”. Guest also recalled, “By after lunch he would come to me and say “Give me a breakdown of the story so far. Where have I just been before this scene?” We used to feed him black coffee all morning but then we discovered he was lacing it. But he was a very professional actor and very easy to work with”.|$|E
500|$|In the 1971 Candidates matches, Fischer {{was set to}} {{play against}} Soviet {{grandmaster}} and concert pianist Mark Taimanov in the quarter-finals. [...] "Their match was to begin in May 1971 in Vancouver, Canada, on the beautiful campus of the University of British Columbia." [...] "Analysts and players alike predicted that Fischer would win the Candidates, but not without a struggle. Tal predicted that Fischer would win 5½–4½ against Taimanov." [...] " [...] saw himself as the firm favorite in the Taimanov match. He was not alone; the noncommunist press was of the same mind. Only Taimanov insisted that he could win, dismissing Fischer as a mere computer". Taimanov had reason to be confident. He was backed by the firm guidance of Botvinnik, who [...] "had thoroughly analysed Fischer's record and put together a 'dossier' on him", from {{when he was in}} talks to play Fischer in a match [...] "a couple of years earlier". After Fischer defeated Taimanov in the second game of the match, Taimanov asked Fischer how he managed {{to come up with the}} move 12. N1c3, to which Fischer replied [...] "that the idea was not his—he had come across it in the monograph by the Soviet master Alexander Nikitin in a footnote". Taimanov said of this: [...] "It is staggering that I, an expert on the Sicilian, should have missed this theoretically significant idea by my compatriot, while Fischer had uncovered it in a book in a foreign language!" [...] With the score at 4–0, in Fischer's favor, the fifth game adjournment was a sight to behold. Schonberg explains the scene:Taimanov came to Vancouver with two seconds, both grandmasters. Fischer was alone. He thought that the sight of Taimanov and his seconds was the funniest thing he had ever seen. There Taimanov and his seconds would sit, six hands flying, pocket sets waving in the air, while variations were being spouted all over the place. And there sat Taimanov with a confused look on his face. Just before resuming play [...] the seconds were giving Taimanov some last-minute advice. When poor Taimanov entered the playing room and sat down to confront Fischer, his head <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> conflicting continuations that he became rattled, left a Rook en prise and immediately resigned. Fischer beat Taimanov by the score of 6–0. [...] "The record books showed that the only comparable achievement to the 6–0 score against Taimanov was Wilhelm Steinitz's 7–0 win against Joseph Henry Blackburne in 1876 in an era of more primitive defensive technique." [...] "Who would have imagined that any challenger's match would ever have been decided by a perfect score, when the participants are all to be ranked among the strongest players in the world?" [...] "It is difficult to portray to non-chess players the magnitude of such a shutout. A typical result between well-matched players might be, say, six wins to four, with nine draws". Taimanov later recalled, [...] "When Grand Masters play, they see the logic of their opponent's moves. One's moves may be so powerful that the other may not be able to stop him, but the plan behind the moves will be clear. Not so with Fischer. His moves did not make sense..." ...|$|E

2500|$|From 1827 onwards Liszt gave {{lessons in}} {{composition}} and piano playing. He wrote on December 23, 1829 [...] that his schedule <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> lessons that each day, from half-past {{eight in the}} morning till 10 at night, he had scarcely breathing time. Most of Liszt's students of this period were amateurs, {{but there were also}} some who made a professional career. An example of the former is Valérie Boissier, the later Comtesse de Gasparin. Examples of the latter are Julius Eichberg, Pierre Wolff, and Hermann Cohen. During winter 1835–36 they were Liszt's colleagues at the Conservatoire at Geneva. Wolff then went to Saint Petersburg.|$|E

2500|$|On 5 June 1944, {{the ships}} {{were kept in}} the dark about the actual timing of the invasion. [...] "The secrecy {{surrounding}} the whole thing was uncanny." [...] As the ships began to congregate, the crew did not know whether this was the real thing or another rehearsal. As the number of ships poured in, it soon became obvious. According to crew member Ted Guzda, [...] "We knew when the invasion would come because the channel <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> ships you couldn’t count them. The sea was so rough that when we started we couldn’t make it." [...] Executive officer, Lt. Bradley Moll recalled, [...] "...it was quite a sight to see the task force gathering in the blue-grey channel mist, grouping from various ports, and destined to control one of the beaches on D-Day." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thomas Dinely, an English {{traveller}} in Ireland in 1681, {{remarked that}} [...] "the Irish of all stations and condicõns were crosses in their hatts, some of pins, some of green ribbon." [...] Jonathan Swift, writing to [...] "Stella" [...] of Saint Patrick's Day 1713, said [...] "the Mall <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> crosses that I thought {{all the world}} was Irish". In the 1740s, the badges pinned were multicoloured interlaced fabric. In the 1820s, they were only worn by children, with simple multicoloured daisy patterns. In the 1890s, they were almost extinct, and a simple green Greek cross inscribed in a circle of paper (similar to the Ballina crest pictured). The Irish Times in 1935 reported they were still sold in poorer parts of Dublin, but fewer than those of previous years [...] "some in velvet or embroidered silk or poplin, with the gold paper cross entwined with shamrocks and ribbons".|$|E
2500|$|Total cleanup {{time for}} most of the beaches was about 45 days after the initial spill, {{although}} globs of tar continued to wash ashore due to the high seep rate, and bigger patches came ashore during subsequent spills. [...] Most beaches were open to the public by June 1, although some of the rocky areas on the shore were not cleaned until around August 15. [...] Yet oil continued to pool and wash up on shore; on August 26, the harbor <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> oil that once again it had to be closed, with cleanup crews spreading straw from boats to bunch the oil up again, just as they had six months before. [...] Indeed, oil from the spill persisted in the ocean into 1970, with large areas of crude still being observed. [...] Since the spill occurred during the stormy season, when beach sand is at its lowest levels (it replenishes {{during the course of a}} normal spring and summer), one fear was that regions of oily sand would be revealed during the following winter; however this did not happen.|$|E

2500|$|Murphy also preached {{the need}} for a pure mind and body and {{abolished}} the old attitude that athletes in training for a physical test required ale and certain stimulants [...] "to give them the vim and make them 'go.'" [...] He also became known for his advocacy of not over-working an athlete during training. In 1895, one of his athletes, Sweeney, set a world record in the high jump. Murphy rested Sweeney for three days before the International Games against England, and Sweeney {{spent most of his time}} in bed. When Sweeney arrived at the field on the day of the competition, [...] "he <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> ginger he could hardly stand still" [...] and set a world record. Another writer emphasized Murphy's recognition in his training regimen that an athlete is a human:"He is the originator of the now generally accepted belief that an athlete is a human. Under his system the old idea of athletes being steamed and worked like mules was banished. Training with weighted shoes or running uphill in rubber boots were old methods that were put into the discard. Light shoes for racing and heavier ones for workout are enough." ...|$|E
