5|$|The {{prizes for}} the {{competition}} were $1 million {{for first place}} (Watson), $300,000 for second place (Jennings), and $200,000 for third place (Rutter). As promised, IBM donated 100% of Watson's <b>winnings</b> to charity, with 50% of those <b>winnings</b> going to World Vision and 50% going to World Community Grid. Similarly, Jennings and Rutter donated 50% of their <b>winnings</b> to their respective charities.|$|E
5|$|The {{software}} {{allows the}} user to monitor each poker session's profit or loss, hands played, time played, and table style. It calculates and graphs statistics such as hands per hour, <b>winnings</b> per hand, <b>winnings</b> per hour, cumulative profit and loss, and individual game profit and loss across multiple currencies.|$|E
5|$|Originally from southwestern Ohio, Larson {{used his}} cash <b>winnings</b> for taxes {{and real estate}} investments. However, he also had {{problems}} with the law and was involved in illegal schemes. As a result, Larson lost all of his <b>winnings</b> within {{two years of the}} show's taping and moved to Florida, where he later died of throat cancer at the age of 49. Since his death in 1999, Larson's game has re-aired on TV at various times and inspired the 2003 Game Show Network documentary Big Bucks: The Press Your Luck Scandal.|$|E
5|$|After {{his initial}} {{appearance}} on the show, Chu competed in the 2014 Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions, where he finished second to Ben Ingram, an IT consultant from South Carolina. Chu won $100,000 for his second-place finish, bringing his overall <b>winnings</b> to $398,200.|$|E
5|$|By {{winning the}} 6,494-entrant Main Event {{at the age}} of 21, Cada surpassed Peter Eastgate as the {{youngest}} champion ever. Cada had two previous WSOP in the money finishes, both in 2009. Cada had been a regular online poker player for several years prior to winning the live WSOP event. He is primarily an online poker player, with more than $500,000 in online tournament <b>winnings</b> at present. As of October 2016, his total live tournament <b>winnings</b> exceed $10,460,000. Cada became a representative of Team PokerStars in 2009 in the weeks prior to becoming World Champion. On June 18, 2012, he lost heads up in the 2,811-entrant $1,500 No Limit Texas hold 'em event at the 2012 World Series of Poker.|$|E
5|$|Each {{contestant}} had {{the same}} decision facing them as before, which was whether to attempt {{to answer the question}} or walk away with their pre-tournament total intact. Attempting the question and answering incorrectly incurred the same penalty as in regular play, with a reduction of their pre-tournament <b>winnings</b> to $25,000. If the question was answered correctly, the player that did so became the tournament leader. If another player after him/her answered correctly, that player assumed the lead and the previous leader kept their pre-tournament <b>winnings.</b> The highest remaining seed to have attempted and correctly answered their question {{at the end of the}} tournament on November 20, 2009 would be declared the winner and become the syndicated series' third millionaire.|$|E
5|$|After {{a three-week}} airtime break, he became {{eligible}} for the Tournament of Champions on February 24 when he won for the fifth time; his total <b>winnings</b> were $123,600. On February 26, he became the ninth biggest all-time Jeopardy! winner, {{with a total of}} $180,000. The next day, he jumped to third, with a total of $238,200.|$|E
5|$|At first, CBS {{refused to}} pay Larson, {{considering}} him a cheater. However, Brockman and the producers {{could not find a}} clause in the game's rules with which to disqualify him (largely because the board had been constructed with these patterns {{from the beginning of the}} series), and the network complied. Because he had surpassed the CBS <b>winnings</b> cap (at the time) of $25,000, Larson was not allowed to return for the next show.|$|E
5|$|Craig is {{the holder}} {{of the all-time}} record for single-day <b>winnings</b> on Jeopardy!. On the episode that aired September 14, 2010, he amassed a score of $47,000 after the game's first two rounds, then wagered and won an {{additional}} $30,000 in the Final Jeopardy! round, finishing with $77,000. The previous single-day record of $75,000 had been set by Jennings.|$|E
5|$|Fleury was a {{participant}} {{on the second}} season of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation figure skating reality show Battle of the Blades, aired {{in the fall of}} 2010, and was donating his <b>winnings</b> to The Men's Project, a charity that provides support for men abused in childhood. His partner was Jamie Salé and the pair finished 5th.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, ABC {{launched}} an ultra high-stakes version of Millionaire entitled Who Wants to Be a Super Millionaire, with a $10,000,000 top prize. Two separate Super Millionaire series aired, one in February {{and one in}} May of that year. However, despite the higher stakes {{and the potential for}} someone to top the all-time record for <b>winnings,</b> the largest prize awarded was $1,000,000 won by Robert Essig.|$|E
5|$|In {{the season}} finale, Andrew Kravis {{defeated}} Brandon Saunders {{to win the}} grand prize, for an overall total of $2,326,346. Seacrest then announced that Kravis's <b>winnings</b> would be increased to $2,600,000 to make him the all-time highest-earning regular-season contestant on a single American game show, surpassing Ken Jennings's $2,522,700 run on Jeopardy! in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Massaro {{initially}} {{found out}} about World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) 2005 Raw Diva Search when she met a WWE casting director during a swimsuit pageant. After beating the seven other chosen finalists, Massaro was declared the winner on the August 15, 2005 edition of Raw. Her <b>winnings</b> included $250,000 and a one-year contract with WWE.|$|E
5|$|On August 23, 2000, the Survivor: Borneo finale {{received}} the highest ratings of any Survivor episode to date {{with an average}} of 51.7 million viewers. Nielsen reported that 125 million people watched at least some part of the finale. The season was released on DVD on May 11, 2004. In 2006, it was revealed that Hatch failed to declare his <b>winnings,</b> among other earnings, in his tax return and was sentenced to 51 months imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|Act III Le Chiffre tortures Bond {{in order}} to find out where Bond has hidden the cheque for his <b>winnings,</b> but Bond does not reveal where it is. After a fight between Bond and Le Chiffre's guards, Bond shoots and wounds Le Chiffre, saving Valerie in the process. Exhausted, Bond sits in a chair {{opposite}} Le Chiffre to talk. Mathis gets in between them and Le Chiffre grabs her from behind, threatening her with a concealed razor blade. As Le Chiffre moves towards the door with Mathis as a shield, she struggles, breaking free slightly and Bond is able to shoot Le Chiffre.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his WSOP success, he was playing {{approximately}} 2,000 hands per day online at PokerStars under the User ID jcada99. Cada had been a professional poker player for six years at {{the time of}} his world championship. Between the end of 2008 and the 2009 November Nine, Cada had earned $551,788 online. Prior to the tournament, he had a $150,000 downswing that necessitated him finding a financial backer for the WSOP. Professional poker financiers Eric Haber and Cliff Josephy paid his entry fee in exchange for half of his <b>winnings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before 1984, {{all three}} contestants {{received}} their <b>winnings</b> in cash (contestants who finished with $0 or a negative score received consolation prizes). This was changed {{in order to}} make the game more competitive, and avoid the problem of contestants who would stop participating in the game, or avoid wagering in Final Jeopardy!, rather than risk losing the money they had already won. From 1984 to 2002, non-winning contestants on the Trebek version received vacation packages and merchandise, which were donated by manufacturers as promotional consideration. The current cash consolation prize is provided by Geico.|$|E
5|$|Eddie {{returns to}} {{challenge}} Fats again, putting up his entire $3,000 stake {{on a single}} game. He wins game after game, beating Fats so badly that Fats is forced to quit. Bert demands a share of Eddie's <b>winnings</b> and threatens that Eddie will be injured unless he pays. But Eddie says that {{if he is not}} killed he will kill Bert when he recovers; invoking the memory of Sarah, he shames Bert into giving up his claim. Instead, Bert orders Eddie never to walk into a big-time pool hall again. Eddie and Fats compliment each other as players, and Eddie walks out.|$|E
5|$|Hard times {{forced the}} family to {{relocate}} to San Francisco, California when Turner was six years old, and her parents soon separated. On December 14, 1930, her father won some money at a traveling craps game, stuffed his <b>winnings</b> in his left sock, and headed for home. He was later found murdered {{on the corner of}} Minnesota and Mariposa Streets, on the edge of San Francisco's Potrero Hill and the Dogpatch District with his left shoe and sock missing. The robbery and homicide were never solved.|$|E
5|$|In November 1984, Larson {{learned about}} a local radio show {{promotion}} promising a $30,000 prize for matching a $1bill's serial number with a random number read {{out on the}} air. Over several days, he withdrew his remaining <b>winnings</b> in $1bills, examined each dollar, and (upon discovering {{that he did not}} have the winning number) re-deposited roughly half of the money. Larson left about $50,000 in his house, which was stolen in a burglary while he was attending a Christmas party. The case remains unsolved to this day.|$|E
5|$|In {{the centre}} of the {{foreground}} is a figure modelled on Caius Gabriel Cibber's Raving Madness, which at the time was one of two monumental sculptures above the entrance to Bethlem Hospital ("Bedlam"), and a well-known London landmark and symbol of insanity. The chained figure is contorted in agony struggling to escape his bonds, while a daemon pulls {{on one end of the}} chain. Beside this lunatic is an unconscious or dead gambler, his <b>winnings</b> spread on the floor beside him.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} round, there are again three {{question}}s. Each question {{starts with a}} value of $10,000 and has two correct answers; the team must select both correct answers {{in order to get}} credit. After the second round, the contestants secretly vote on which of them will be eliminated from further play. In order to eliminate a contestant, the other three must agree unanimously. If there is no unanimous agreement, then the contestants are given a 15-second grace period (10 seconds in season one only) before their bank begins to drain. Once there is a unanimous agreement, the chosen contestant is eliminated from the show with no <b>winnings.</b>|$|E
5|$|In this bonus round, {{each member}} of the winning team plays the same {{question}} individually. While the first contestant is asked the question, the second is isolated offstage so that they cannot see or hear the question. The two teammates have a total of 40 seconds to answer (in seasons 1 and 2, the time limit was 30 seconds); the clock stops when the first contestant submits an answer, and resumes when the second contestant first sees the question. If one team member answers the question correctly, they receive an additional $1,000; if both answer correctly, their <b>winnings</b> are augmented to $10,000.|$|E
5|$|Legler {{held the}} record {{for well over a}} year. As 2000 ended and 2001 began, the {{producers}} of Millionaire decided that it had been too long (71 games over a five-month period) since their top prize had been won, and instituted an accumulating jackpot which added $10,000 to the grand prize amount for each game it was not won. Kevin Olmstead claimed the top prize on April 10, 2001, winning a jackpot of $2,180,000. Olmstead became the first contestant to top $2,000,000 in total <b>winnings</b> on a game show and supplanted Legler as the all-time leader.|$|E
5|$|Many people, {{including}} Fudge, do {{not believe}} Harry and Dumbledore about Voldemort's return, and as Fudge has the Dementor's Kiss performed, Crouch Jr. is unable to give testimony. Hermione discovers Rita Skeeter is an unregistered Animagus, who can {{take the form of}} a beetle, and blackmails her to force her to stop writing her libellous stories. Not wanting his tournament <b>winnings,</b> Harry gives them to Fred and George to start their joke shop and returns home with the Dursleys.|$|E
5|$|Murphy {{became a}} Christian {{at the age}} of 15, after meeting a {{religious}} family on holiday. Murphy is well known for his charitable nature, having spent some of the summer of 2006 doing aid work in Zimbabwe with his then wife, Clare. He also donated one-tenth of his 2005 World Championship <b>winnings</b> to the church, and at the 2012 World Snooker Championship Murphy donated £100 to the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital Charity for every century he made.|$|E
5|$|On the {{syndicated}} version's first season, two contestants correctly answered all 15 questions {{and won the}} top prize of $1,000,000: Kevin Smith on February 18, 2003, and Nancy Christy on May 8 of the same year. During the Million Dollar Tournament of Ten which aired in November 2009, Sam Murray, who had previously supplied correct responses for eleven questions, risked his <b>winnings</b> on a special $1,000,000 question; {{he was the only}} contestant to answer his question correctly.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{countdown}} clock reaches zero, the four contestants {{with the highest}} totals throughout the game keep all of their credited <b>winnings</b> and compete {{in a series of}} three elimination bouts; the fourth and third-place winners face off in a 400-second bout, the victor of the first bout faces the second-place winner (400 seconds), and the victor of the second bout faces the first-place winner (500 seconds). The victor of the final bout receives a further $2,000,000.|$|E
5|$|Smythe {{first became}} {{interested}} in horse racing as a boy, when he would take stories his father wrote at the track to the newspaper office downtown. Smythe started owning horses in the late 1920s, but he rarely had any success. One early purchase {{turned out to be}} one of his most famous. When Mrs. L. A. Livingston sold off her stable, he bought Rare Jewel, a filly, for $250. The filly regularly ran last. The horse was eligible for the Coronation Futurity Stakes, one of the best two-year-old races. Smythe was full of blind hope, and on the trainer's advice, entered her in the race. The day of the race, both the trainer and his partner gave the horse some brandy, unknown to Smythe, who bet over $100 on Rare Jewel. She won the race, a 100–1 longshot paying $214.40 on a $2 bet, besting future Queen's Plate winner Froth Blower. Between the <b>winnings</b> from his bets and his portion of the winner's purse as horse owner, Smythe won more than $10,000 on that one race. Three weeks later, he put his windfall to work for the Maple Leafs by purchasing star defenceman King Clancy from the depression-strapped Ottawa Senators for $35,000. The purchase was only possible because of his gambling <b>winnings,</b> as the other Maple Leafs owners refused to pay the Senators' then-high price, and only agreed when Smythe volunteered to use his own money.|$|E
5|$|The IBM Challenge aired February 14–16, 2011, and {{featured}} IBM's Watson computer facing {{off against}} Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter in a two-game match played over three shows. This {{was the first}} man-vs.-machine competition in Jeopardy!s history. Watson won both the first game and the overall match to win the grand prize of $1 million, which IBM divided between two charities (World Vision International and World Community Grid). Jennings, who won $300,000 for second place, and Rutter, who won the $200,000 third-place prize, both pledged to donate half of their <b>winnings</b> to charity. The competition brought the show its highest ratings since the Ultimate Tournament of Champions.|$|E
5|$|The top scorer(s) in {{each game}} retain {{the value of}} their <b>winnings</b> in cash, and return to play in the next match. Non-winners receive {{consolation}} prizes. Since May 16, 2002, consolation prizes have been $2,000 for the second-place contestant(s) and $1,000 for the third-place contestant. Since the show does not generally provide airfare or lodging for contestants, cash consolation prizes alleviate contestants' financial burden. An exception is provided for returning champions who must make several flights to Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Various special editions and tournaments {{have been}} {{conducted}} which feature celebrities playing the game and donating <b>winnings</b> to charities of their choice. During celebrity editions on the original ABC version, contestants were allowed to receive help from their fellow contestants during the first ten questions. The most successful celebrity contestants throughout the show's run have included Drew Carey, Rosie O'Donnell, Norm Macdonald, and Chip Esten, all of whom won $500,000 for their respective charities. The episode featuring O'Donnell's $500,000 win averaged 36.1 million viewers, the highest number for a single episode of the show.|$|E
5|$|After {{forfeiting}} {{his title}} as World Champion, Fischer became reclusive and sometimes erratic, disappearing from both competitive chess {{and the public}} eye. In 1992, he reemerged to win an unofficial rematch against Spassky. It was held in Yugoslavia, which was under a United Nations embargo at the time. His participation led to a conflict with the U.S. government, which sought income tax on Fischer's match <b>winnings,</b> and ultimately issued a warrant for his arrest. After that, he lived his life as an émigré. In 2004, {{he was arrested in}} Japan and held for several months for using a passport that had been revoked by the U.S. government. Eventually, he was granted an Icelandic passport and citizenship by a special act of the Icelandic Althing, allowing him to live in Iceland until his death in 2008.|$|E
5|$|After the ten minutes, {{the first}} team comes on-stage, while the second team is placed in a sound-proof booth. The host then asks the team {{questions}} from the announced category. Each question is given, in rotation, to one player, who cannot confer with teammates. Both teams play {{the same set of}} questions. Each team has a total of 60 seconds to answer as many questions as possible, and the team that answers more questions correctly wins $20,000 for their charity; the runners-up win $5,000 for their charity. Teams that win this round advance to a semi-final game; the winners of that episode advance to the season finale, where the team that wins this round wins $100,000 for their charity as well as all <b>winnings</b> from previous episodes.|$|E
5|$|Bond beats Le Chiffre at {{the poker}} table, but Lynd is kidnapped by Le Chiffre after the game, as is Bond, who is {{captured}} whilst pursuing them; Lynd is ransomed {{for the money}} and Bond is tortured. Le Chiffre is subsequently killed by Mr. White, a liaison between Le Chiffre {{and a number of}} his clients. Bond learns that his poker <b>winnings</b> were never repaid to the Treasury, which Lynd was supposed to have done, and Bond establishes that she was a double agent. Bond pursues her and is attacked by members of White's organisation: he survives, but White takes the money and Lynd sacrifices herself in exchange for Bond's life, as he later finds out from M. Bond subsequently finds and captures White.|$|E
