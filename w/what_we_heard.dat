500|$|Reger {{completed}} {{the composition of}} the psalm in May to August 1909. The work was published by Peters in Leipzig, first the vocal score with piano in September 1909, with the piano reduction prepared by Reger himself. The score and the parts appeared in December that year. The complete work was premiered simultaneously on 23 February 1910 in both Chemnitz and Breslau. In Chemnitz, Reger conducted the church choir of St. Lukas and the municipal orchestra (Städtische Kapelle), with Georg Stolz at the organ. In Breslau, [...] conducted the Sing-Akademie and the Orchester-Verein, with organist Max Ansorge. A reviewer wrote in the journal NMZ: [...] "" [...] (Still under the impression of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> and experienced, it is unspeakably difficult for me to express here all the deeply experienced, the sublime and divine of that hour. One was deeply shaken, when the gigantic double fugue ended, had experienced something unforgettable.") ...|$|E
500|$|For his part, anchor Mike Wallace came {{to regret}} his {{participation}} in the episode. [...] "I should have known better," [...] he said in 1992. Speaking in 1996, Wallace stated, [...] "That is [...] God help us [...] what our understanding was of the homosexual lifestyle a mere twenty-five years ago because nobody {{was out of the}} closet and because that's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> from doctors [...] that's what Socarides told us, {{it was a matter of}} shame." [...] However, Wallace was at the time of broadcast close friends with noted designer James Amster (creator of the landmark Amster Yard courtyard in New York City) and Amster's male long-term companion, men whom Wallace later described as [...] "a wonderful old married couple" [...] and [...] "oth people that [...] admired". Despite this personal knowledge, Wallace relied on the American Psychiatric Association's categorization of homosexuality as a mental illness rather than his own experience in creating the episode. As recently as 1995, Wallace told an interviewer that he believed homosexuals could change their orientation if they really wanted to.|$|E
2500|$|Haifa District Court {{spokeswoman}} Nitzan Eyal {{said that}} her family could appeal the ruling. The amount sought was a symbolic US$1 and legal costs. Her mother reacted to the verdict in saying: [...] "I am hurt. We are, of course, deeply saddened and deeply troubled by <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> today from Judge Oded Gershon." [...] Corrie's sister, Sarah Corrie Simpson, stated that she believed [...] "without a doubt" [...] that the driver had seen her as he approached, and stated that she hoped he would one day [...] "have the courage" [...] to tell the truth. The right wing political party Yisrael Beitenu issued a statement that called the verdict [...] "vindication after vilification".|$|E
6000|$|... "After <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> here, that is {{an opinion}} with which I heartily agree," [...] {{a man at the}} back declared. [...] "None of us can doubt that Allinson is a justly {{respected}} name." ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{the fewest}} words {{possible}} I told him <b>what</b> <b>we</b> had <b>heard,</b> and when I was {{come to an}} end of the brief recital, Jacob asked, as if believing that now all our plans would be changed: ...|$|R
5000|$|... 1992 Mr. Sullivan <b>What</b> happened? <b>We</b> <b>heard</b> him {{scream and}} came {{and found him}} like this. A tongue in cheek, black humour collage film made as a music video for the band Nimrod. Later adapted for Vent du Mont Scharr.|$|R
2500|$|Healthy in Paranoid Times was {{met with}} mixed reviews. It was loved and hated by many critics who either called it the band's best work to date or their weakest. It was also called [...] "their most sonically mature album to date." [...] and their best album since Clumsy by Circle 6 Magazine. At the time, the band praised their own efforts on the album. Duncan Coutts said in an interview, [...] "I {{think this is the}} closest we've ever come to {{achieving}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> in our heads and got on (record). For us this is the most complete record, start to finish. Some of the other records had awesome moments, but I think this is as close as we feel we have gotten to getting a whole record exactly the way we wanted it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But if <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> {{last night}} is all true, there's {{somebody}} else that {{does want to}} ask for something, or, as has asked, as folks say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would have}} been dreadful news yesterday," [...] said Gertrude, [...] "but {{compared}} to <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> this morning it is almost like good news. But still," [...] she added, trying to smile, [...] "I am afraid I will not sleep much tonight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a {{very rare}} bird--practically extinct--in England now, but all things are {{possible}} upon the moor. Yes, I {{should not be surprised}} to learn that <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> is the cry of the last of the bitterns." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{asked not}} who was dead. We knew! We raced before the driving snow to Hunno, {{thinking}} perhaps Allo might be there. We found him already at our stables, {{and he saw}} by our faces <b>what</b> <b>we</b> had <b>heard.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I think so. From <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard,</b> Mrs. Arabin must {{be either}} there or at Venice, and I don't suppose I {{could learn from}} any one at Paris at which town she is staying at this moment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess you're Mr. Ormesby, and I'm auctioneer's assistant," [...] he said. [...] "One could {{understand}} {{that you were a}} bit sore, but I can't see that it's my fault, anyway; and from <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard,</b> you don't usually turn strangers into the stable." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then up {{and spoke}} an Egyptian Queen--the {{daughter}} of a Pharoah--and she said, 'Our Palace cannot be plucked up by the roots like a leek {{for the sake of}} a little insect. No! Suleiman-bin-Daoud must be dead, and <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> and saw was the earth thundering and darkening at the news.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{can bear}} with hunger many hours {{and make no}} complaint, as has already been shown at Breed's hill," [...] Hiram replied {{in a tone of}} sharpness. [...] "Because of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> last night, and through knowing that we were locked in here as prisoners, did we come to be {{somewhat}} uneasy in mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{guess we}} are {{aiding and abetting}} a felony, Watson? But, after <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> I don't feel as if I could give the man up, so there is an end of it. All right, Barrymore, you can go." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then <b>we</b> {{told him}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> had <b>heard,</b> and when I {{mentioned}} {{the name of}} the traitor, he brought his hand down on his leg with a resounding thwack that might have been heard some distance away, as he said incautiously loud: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] Major Swan admitted. [...] "It {{is merely}} a {{corroboration}} of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have already <b>heard</b> from Mullins and Sir Terence." ...|$|R
6000|$|He averted {{his eyes}} and did not answer this. It was {{impossible}} to make them out. For instance, his niece was weeping for Falk. Now he (Hermann) would like to wring his neck--but then... He supposed he had too tender a heart. [...] "Frankly," [...] he asked at last, [...] "what {{do you think of}} <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> last night, captain?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Kent, poor Mason has gone. He left {{a message}} for you, and I felt impelled to come and give it now, because I think you were touched by <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> today, {{and in need of}} the help Mason tried to give you,' said the chaplain, taking the one seat and fixing his kind eyes on the grim figure in the bed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Call {{upon the}} wheels, master, {{call upon the}} wheels, [...] Steel is beneath your hand, stone beneath your heels, [...] Steel will never laugh aloud, hearing <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard,</b> [...] Stone will never break its heart, mad with hope deferred-- [...] Men of tact that arbitrate, slow reform that heals-- [...] Save the stinking grease, master, save it for the wheels.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Mrs. Macallan, {{have you}} {{forgotten}} already <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have both <b>heard</b> him say of me while we have been sitting by his bedside?" ...|$|R
60|$|Remark, again, how short the {{sentences}} are. Each {{is made up}} of a very few words, and followed by a full stop, that our minds may come to a full stop likewise, and think over <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> before St. John goes on to tell us more.|$|R
6000|$|... "Jine 'em, say I," [...] replied Joe. [...] "I'm fond of Meyer, and I {{like the}} Scotchman too, {{though he is}} rather fond of argification; besides, {{it strikes me that}} from <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> of diggers' ways, we shall be the better of being a strong party." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Likely enough, as {{to their}} course. They have probably, from <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard,</b> taken and sunk several ships, and some may be in favour of {{returning}} to dispose of their booty, while others may be for cruising longer. I only hope that scoundrel Ruggiero is among those we heard fall. They are quiet now, and one party or the other has evidently {{got the best of}} it. There, they are taking to the oars again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'The Englishman {{is going}} to leave us, {{in a day or}} two. I have not {{forgotten}} what I owe him, and should like to make him a present. I propose that we search all the party thoroughly, today. From <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard,</b> some of them come from the ruby country, and are pretty sure to have gems concealed about them, or in their baggage. I propose that all the stones we find we will give to our friend.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You saw nobody outside there? I hardly {{thought you}} would," [...] he said. [...] "Our animal {{instincts}} are sometimes more useful than our powers of reasoning, Hilton. It {{is probable that}} if you had not checked me, I should now be on my way out of this land of surprises. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> was a diminutive arrow, no doubt with the venom there's no cure for upon its point. It could not have been shot at us by either of the Africans yonder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know we are," [...] Meinik replied, [...] "but we {{were away}} with a caravan of traders when the order came; and so, instead of going down the river, {{we have had to}} journey on foot. But we shall be there in time. From <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard,</b> there has not been much fighting, yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou knowest nought of it," [...] said Wilfred, impatiently; [...] "this dead pause only {{shows that}} the men are at their posts on the walls, and expecting an instant attack; <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> was but the instant muttering of the storm--it will burst anon in all its fury.--Could I but reach yonder window!" ...|$|R
50|$|The double CD, The {{other side}} of all things, was {{released}} on Pleasuredisc Records on February 26, 2005 under the alias Ljungblut. The sound {{is a lot more}} acoustic and melancholic than <b>what</b> <b>we</b> ever <b>heard</b> from Seigmen, but the melodies and lyrics are strong and personal and this is certainly a contender for the title Best Norwegian Album of the Year.|$|R
6000|$|... “I haven’t {{seen her}} for years,” he said, “and in {{comparison}} with what she was then she must be very grown up by now. From <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> from Mr. Blunt she had experiences which would have matured her more than they would teach her. There are of course people that are not teachable. I don’t know that {{she is one of}} them. But as to maturity that’s quite another thing. Capacity for suffering is developed in every human being worthy of the name.” ...|$|E
60|$|So we {{sat down}} in the vault-like place and let the sharp draught of air rushing to and from the {{passages}} play upon us, for we were heated with journeying up those close galleries. As we sat thus I heard a roaring sound and asked Oros what it might be. He answered that we were very near to the crater of the volcano, and that <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> through the thickness of the rock was the rushing of its everlasting fires. Then the ascent commenced.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{care to be}} shut up in {{a palace}} and obliged to live by rule any more. But if <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> is true, {{there is plenty of}} work to do for the poor here, and we have saved so much we can at least begin to help those who suffer most. No one need know us, and we can be at work while waiting for our father to {{remember}} and recall us," [...] answered Plush, who was as princely yet as delicate as the soft silken stuff he loved to wear.|$|E
60|$|And <b>what</b> he <b>heard</b> <b>we</b> {{may very}} fairly guess, {{because we know}} from St. Paul's {{writings}} what {{he was in the}} habit of saying.|$|R
6000|$|... "Excellent," [...] said Sherlock Holmes. [...] "Send the boy for a four-wheeler, and {{we shall}} be off at once." [...] He opened the table-drawer as he spoke, and I noticed that he slipped his {{revolver}} into his pocket. [...] "Yes," [...] said he, in answer to my glance; [...] "I should say from <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard,</b> that <b>we</b> {{are dealing with a}} particularly dangerous gang." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not wish}} to retire," [...] {{promptly}} returned Aunt Martha. [...] "I was never more awake in my life, and couldn't go asleep if I tried. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> {{may or may not be}} true, but it furnishes subjects for reflection--serious reflection. I wish very much to hear what that man in the middle of the bench has to say for himself; I am sure he has a story." ...|$|R
