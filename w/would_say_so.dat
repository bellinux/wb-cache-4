500|$|A Tulsa-area {{supervisor}} {{with the}} U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) commented upon environmental issues {{pertaining to the}} Creek Turnpike in a 19-page letter to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dated February 9, 1990. USACE was responsible for issuing three essential permits (which OTA had applied for on November 6, 1989) that would allow construction to continue, and was required to consider input from the service. In the letter, supervisor Stephen Forsythe recommended that the permits be denied and further studies conducted into alternate routes for the turnpike and the environmental impact on roads that connected to the turnpike. However, USACE only {{had the authority to}} review the impacts the Creek Turnpike itself made on wetland areas. Governor Bellmon publicly criticized Forsythe for focusing on concerns beyond USACE's jurisdiction. Bellmon's Transportation Secretary, Neal McCaleb, publicly stated [...] "I think [...] is out of line and <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>so</b> to Mr. Forsythe." [...] Bellmon and McCaleb discussed the letter in a private meeting with the Secretary of the Interior, Manuel Lujan, although Lujan neither commented nor committed to any action regarding the letter. In response to Bellmon's criticism of the letter, Tulsans Against Turnpikes issued a public statement, saying [...] "Running behind closed political doors like that demonstrates the governor is an environmental hypocrite," [...] contrasting his statements with a letter he wrote assuring a constituent in Jenks that the project would be [...] "the most aesthetically pleasing and environmentally sound facility that can be constructed".|$|E

[...] In The Daily Telegraph, Ed West wrote of Hitchens, [...] "I'm a great admirer of Peter, a decent, kind and deeply compassionate man with {{the air of a}} prophet about him; and like all prophets, doomed to be scorned by so many. I {{think a lot of people}} affect to despise his archaic value system while suspecting that there's something in it, and <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>so</b> if only more influential people would stick their head above the parapet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the release}} of , Black Box {{had been working on}} another entry to the franchise, presumably {{continuing}} the action focused street-racing gameplay of Black Box's previous titles. This game had an extended development window to give the developers a chance to create a game that [...] "could really blow the doors off the category". It was confirmed that the game would feature a fictional storyline and characters. The game was first hinted early in November 2010 by Senior Vice President of EA Games Europe, Patrick Söderlund in an interview with Eurogamer, before {{the release of}} [...] Söderlund stated he wanted to alternate developers to give them time to make a good game. Eurogamer’s Robert Purchese asked, [...] "You say there will be an arcade NFS game every year in November, but next year's game won't be developed by Criterion. Is it Black Box?", Söderlund stated [...] "You can assume that, yes. Yes. I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> yes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘We-e-ell!’ {{said the}} Dean, {{in a more}} {{confidential}} tone, and slightly glancing around him, ‘I <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> generally. Not generally. Enough of suspicion attaches to him to—no, I think I <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> generally.’ ...|$|R
60|$|Margaret {{thought that}} Lady Ball {{had no such}} right, but she <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> <b>so</b> at that moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>would</b> {{naturally}} <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> but that's {{not what}} we have heard," [...] retorted Mr. Jones quickly, with a grin so ghastly {{that it was impossible}} to think it voluntary.|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>so</b> {{if you saw}} her at a lecture; and she is also gaining {{power of}} expressing and reproducing," [...] said Gillian.|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> indeed, if {{you really}} knew her, or how she has found {{strength}} and courage for me through all the terrible sutfering." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; it cannot be. It {{would be}} plain treachery to your parents; Mr. Fellowes <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>so.</b> I am {{sure he would}} not marry us." ...|$|E
6000|$|However, he conquered {{himself by}} the time he had reached the door, and came back to say, [...] "I beg your pardon, mother, I know you <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> <b>so</b> without need." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it isn't anybody else, {{and that}} makes it impossible. Sometimes I think it might be if I <b>would</b> only <b>say</b> <b>so</b> to myself, and then all that I said to her about you comes up----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's not {{of myself}} I'm thinking; and it's only you, and such as you, <b>would</b> be <b>saying</b> <b>so</b> of me. But supposing now, the owld man consinted to this bargain,--how {{would he be}} sure of his money?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{say that}} it is a false calumny,--a lie! and I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>so</b> to any man on earth who should dare to slander my child's name." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well--lower than me. That is {{what you}} have said, and I do not believe that you <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>so</b> falsely. You would not descend to flatter me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Alas! I {{feared that}} you <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>so.</b> Had I taken you, Nigel--that is your name, is it not?--had I taken you, I {{would not have}} acted thus." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you were}} engaged {{to a man}} you {{would be much better}} to him. You <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> <b>so</b> much, but what you did <b>say</b> <b>would</b> be all affection. I am always making horrid little speeches, for which I should like to cut out my tongue afterwards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> Mrs. Trevelyan; {{but who can}} tell? I am sure of this,--that {{he should}} not be left alone. If it were only because of the misery of his life, {{he should not be}} left alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, mamma," [...] Percy said, [...] "from some {{particulars}} he gave, {{and from}} what he said, I feel almost sure--I may say I am quite sure--it is Ralph. I <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> you know, unless I felt very certain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{thought the}} monshure <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>so.</b> The last {{molasses}} {{that we had}} was excellent good. It isn’t likely that you have any more of it on hand?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew you}} <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> Ambrose," [...] {{returned}} Charlotte. [...] "All the same, the child's thought shames me that I've {{never done anything}} for the poor old thing; and she won't harm me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew you}} <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>so.</b> If I {{understand}} rightly {{there is something}} like a jealousy of her case in the Merrifields, prompted greatly by their wish to expiate any neglect of her father." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> <b>so</b> did you but {{know what}} I know," [...] she {{informed}} me roguishly. [...] "Often, I confess, rumour may swell {{the importance of}} such an affaire, {{but in this case}} I do not think that rumour does it justice." ...|$|R
60|$|I had {{no answer}} ready for him. I knew that in my grief for Margaret I had been advocating an unworthy course, but I <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> <b>so.</b> I went gloomily to the door, and there, presently, his hand fell on my shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Mike shrewdly {{believed}} that it was due to Miss Panney's knowledge of some of Molly's misdeeds, and not to any desire to please the old lady, that the commands of the latter were law to the Irishwoman, but he <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> <b>so.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>so</b> if I did, Mrs. Milray," [...] said Clementina. [...] "I was hu't, at the time; but I don't care {{anything}} for it, now. I hope you won't {{think about it}} any more!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And that Hermann hates me, I know it!" [...] {{he cried}} in his undertone, {{with a sudden}} {{recrudescence}} of anxiety. [...] "I must tell them. It is proper that they should know. You <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>so</b> yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The rest {{is still}} more wonderful," [...] replied Scheherazade, [...] "and you <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> if the sultan {{would allow me to}} live another day, and would give me leave to tell it to you the next night." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sam {{looked a}} little disconcerted, and it struck her that, though he <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> he was {{doubtful}} whether the Greville influence might not render Henry unmanageable; but he quickly gave it another turn. [...] "Only you must not plague us about London manners." ...|$|R
60|$|But Frank <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> <b>so.</b> To {{postpone}} {{his marriage}} for four years, or for three, {{seemed to him}} to be tantamount to giving up Mary altogether; {{and he would not}} acknowledge that any one had the right to demand of him to do that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can you not? If you saw him, and the house, and my mother, you <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> <b>so.</b> In the Bible {{it is said}} of some {{season that}} it is not a time for marrying, or for giving in marriage. And so it is with us." ...|$|R
6000|$|Kea {{turned her}} big brown eyes full upon me, all tearful as they were. [...] "If you knew all," [...] she answered, [...] "you <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>so</b> indeed. You would pity me, both of you--oh, {{how you would}} pity me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{say that}} he asked you, Everett. I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>so,</b> {{in spite of its}} being a lie, if I didn't fear that your father might say {{something}} unkind, so that the lie would be detected by both of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Few <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>so</b> if {{they thought}} so,' said Claude. 'I have been quite admiring the way Rotherwood has gone on--enjoying the fun {{as if he was}} nobody--just as Reginald might, making other people happy, and making no secret of his {{satisfaction}} in it all.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I do. I {{think we}} shall have a verdict; I do, indeed. I <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> <b>so</b> before Lady Mason if my opinion was not very strong. The jury may disagree. That is not improbable. But I cannot {{anticipate}} that the verdict will be against us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I was {{not fully}} {{convinced}} that it was right, and the best for all parties, I <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> <b>so</b> much about it," [...] said Henrietta, in a tone rather {{as if she was}} preparing for some great sacrifice, instead of domineering over her mother.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Barbara," [...] {{he said in}} a drolly serious fashion, [...] "if {{you think}} the Court of Chancery <b>would</b> seriously object, <b>say</b> <b>so</b> at once." ...|$|R
