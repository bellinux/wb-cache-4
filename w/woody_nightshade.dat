40|$|Contamination {{caused by}} heavy metals has been long known {{as well as}} its toxic effects on the {{environment}} and mankind. Several approaches have been taken for the cleaning up of such contamination but none of them can efficiently counteract these toxic effects. Chemical reduction/neutralization/precipitation electrochemical treatment, ion exchange, carbon adsorption, membrane filtration, and electro and evaporative recovery are some of the current technologies used to eliminate heavy metals from the environment. These techniques have proven extremely expensive and ineffective. It has also been observed that some native plants such as the <b>woody</b> subshrub silverleaf <b>nightshade</b> (Solanum elaeagnifolium) have survived within the areas polluted with heavy metals. Scientists and engineers have realized that these plants can be used for heavy metal removal from contaminated soils and waters. The removal of metals from water can be achieved using living or inactivated plants. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|R

50|$|The species most {{commonly}} called nightshade in North America and Britain is Solanum dulcamara, also called bittersweet or <b>woody</b> <b>nightshade.</b> Its foliage and egg-shaped red berries are poisonous, the active principle being solanine, {{which can cause}} convulsions and death if taken in large doses. The black nightshade (S. nigrum) is also generally considered poisonous, but its fully ripened fruit and foliage are cooked and eaten in some areas. The deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna) {{is not in the}} Solanum genus, but {{is a member of the}} wider Solanaceae family.|$|E

40|$|This article studies what Anglo-Saxons {{in around}} 700 [...] 900 {{understood}} by the Latin plant-name elleborus, looking particularly at Aldhelm's Latin riddle Elleborus, {{which suggests that the}} word was understood to denote <b>woody</b> <b>nightshade</b> (Solanum dulcamara). It examines the semantics of Old English words that gloss elleborus in earlier Anglo-Saxon sources: wedeberge, ceasteræsc, ceasterwyrte, and ælfþone. The article finds evidence for the presence of a copy of Dioscorides’ De materia medica in seventh-century Canterbury. It also argues for a culturally significant connection between ingesting <b>woody</b> <b>nightshade,</b> the production of an altered state of mind attested in Latin as dementia cordis and in Old English as wedenheortnes, and elves. Ælfþone might originally have meant {{something along the lines of}} ‘vine which causes the symptoms which elves cause’. It seems likely that there was a custom of ingesting it deliberately to achieve mind-altering effects...|$|E
40|$|Lesions of Phytophthora infestans {{were found}} on <b>woody</b> <b>{{nightshade}}</b> (Solanum dulcamara), black nightshade (S. nigrum) and S. sisymbriifolium during a nationwide late blight survey in the Netherlands in 1999 and 2000. Pathogenicity and spore production of P. infestans isolates collected from potato (S. tuberosum), S. nigrum, S. dulcamara and S. sisymbriifolium were determined on several host plant species, and oospore formation in naturally infected and inoculated foliage of hosts was quantified. The present population of P. infestans in the Netherlands is pathogenic on S. nigrum, S. dulcamara and S. sisymbriifolium. Oospores were produced in leaves of S. nigrum, S. dulcamara and S. sisymbriifolium following infection with A 1 and A 2 isolates. Therefore these plant species {{should be regarded as}} alternative hosts for the late blight pathogen. In the case of S. nigrum and S. dulcamara infection was a relatively rare event, suggesting that diseased plants do not significantly contribute to the overall late blight disease pressure present in potato-production areas. Oospore production in ageing S. nigrum and S. dulcamara plants in autumn, however, may generate a considerable source of (auto) infections in following years. Considerable numbers of sporangia and oospores were produced on S. sisymbriifolium following infection with P. infestans. Additional field infection data are needed to evaluate the epidemiological consequences of a commercial introduction of S. sisymbriifolium as a potato cyst nematode trap cro...|$|E
