5|$|During {{a central}} eclipse, the Moon's umbra (or antumbra, {{in the case}} of an annular eclipse) moves rapidly from <b>west</b> <b>to</b> <b>east</b> across the Earth. The Earth is also {{rotating}} from <b>west</b> <b>to</b> <b>east,</b> at about 28km/min at the Equator, but as the Moon is moving in the same direction as the Earth's spin at about 61km/min, the umbra almost always appears to move in a roughly west-east direction across a map of the Earth at the speed of the Moon's orbital velocity minus the Earth's rotational velocity.|$|E

While the two highways still passed through Pawhuska from <b>west</b> <b>to</b> <b>east,</b> after turning north, the new route bypassed much of the city. The application for this alteration was submitted to AASHTO on September 22, received the same day, and approved on November 8.|$|E
5|$|Project Cirrus was {{the first}} attempt to modify a hurricane. It was a {{collaboration}} of the General Electric Corporation, the US Army Signal Corps, the Office of Naval Research, and the US Air Force. After several preparations, and initial skepticism by government scientists, the first attempt to modify a hurricane began on October 13, 1947 on a hurricane that was heading <b>west</b> <b>to</b> <b>east</b> and out to sea.|$|E

25|$|Broadly {{speaking}} the area {{can be divided}} into three bands, the divisions between which run south <b>west</b> <b>to</b> north <b>east.</b> Generally {{speaking the}} rocks become younger from north <b>west</b> <b>to</b> south <b>east.</b> The north western band is composed of early to mid-Ordovician sedimentary rocks, largely mudstones and siltstones of marine origin. Together they comprise the Skiddaw Group and include the rocks traditionally known as the Skiddaw Slates. Their friability generally leads to mountains with relatively smooth slopes such as Skiddaw itself.|$|R
5|$|The Cascade Range is {{dramatically}} different in climate from <b>west</b> <b>to</b> <b>east.</b> The west side is heavily forested and features trees such as Douglas firs, western hemlock, Pacific silver firs, and Alaska yellow cedars. East of the Cascades, where Yamsay lies, the climate becomes much drier, even arid. Precipitation significantly declines and vegetation becomes more sparse, with lodgepole pine, white fir, ponderosa pine, and juniper. To the south, chaparral {{plants such as}} beargrass and bitterbrush prevail.|$|E
5|$|The Itcha Range {{is part of}} an east-west {{trending}} volcanic zone {{called the}} Anahim Volcanic Belt. This consists of large shield volcanoes, small cinder cones, lava domes and lava flows that become progressively younger from <b>west</b> <b>to</b> <b>east.</b> Several explanations have been made regarding the creation of this feature, each citing a different geologic process. If volcanic activity were to resume at the Itcha Range, Canada's Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan (IVENP) is prepared to notify people threatened by eruptions.|$|E
