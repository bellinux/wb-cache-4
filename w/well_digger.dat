50|$|Sybaris {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} Greek colonies (founded ca. 720 B.C.). It was supposed to be located near the modern town of Sibari in Calabria on the coast of Southern Italy near the Crati and Coscile rivers but eventually was buried by silt. His archaeological and historical research, along with geological and geographical reconnaissance, led him to believe the city lay now {{on both sides of the}} Crati. Archaeologists had traditionally used a trench system to investigate sites and in the early 1930s the Italian government had excavated two parallel drainage ditches to alleviate the area of its malarial swamp. In 1950, inspired by methods used by Italian <b>well</b> <b>diggers,</b> he invented the core-sampling method, hiring several <b>well</b> <b>diggers</b> (and their oxen) to pound pipes down into the earth, bring up the pipes and deposit their contents into long wooden boxes to be examined. The fourth boring at its deepest level revealed the pottery of Sybaris, the first evidence in situ of the city.|$|R
50|$|Wells {{often had}} to be sunk a {{considerable}} depth in order to tap the nearest geological stratum holding sufficient water, the actual depth depending on {{the height of the}} castle and level of the groundwater. This was particularly challenging in the construction of hill castles. In addition, there was also the problem of providing sufficient oxygen for <b>well</b> <b>diggers</b> as they dug the well out of the rock by hand.|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} supply fresh {{air to the}} <b>well</b> <b>diggers</b> during construction, a {{dividing}} wall, usually of wood, was built into the well shaft, any gaps being stuffed with straw and pitch {{to make it as}} airtight as possible.

Fresh air (and hence oxygen) circulated through the artificially built U-shaped pipe so created, its two halves being separated by the dividing wall. This supplied fresh air at the [...] "bend" [...] which provided the diggers with sufficient oxygen.|$|R

At 17, Zeisel entered Budapest's Magyar Képzőművészeti Akadémia (Hungarian Royal Academy of Fine Arts) as a painter. However, to support her painting, she eventually decided to pursue a more practical profession and apprenticed herself to Jakob Karapancsik, the last pottery master in the medieval guild system. From him she learned ceramics from the ground up. After graduating as a journeyman she found work with German ceramic manufacturers. She was the first woman to qualify as a journeyman in the Hungarian Guild of Chimney Sweeps, Oven Makers, Roof Tilers, <b>Well</b> <b>Diggers</b> and Potters.|$|R

50|$|One {{feature of}} Lemberg Castle is its shaft cistern, also, {{but not quite}} correctly, called the well shaft. After digging down 94.80 metres the <b>well</b> <b>diggers</b> had still not struck the ground water. So the shaft {{was turned into a}} cistern and almost {{horizontal}} adit driven to the shaft. After almost 200 metres the adit meets the shaft at a depth of about 60 metres. A spring on the hillside filled the shaft via the adit thus providing the required water supply. All the work was carried out with hammers and chisels. It is also remarkable that the tunnel ever intercepted the shaft. The well proved to be a valuable archaeological site during several excavation projects in the 1990s, especially for the period of the destruction of the castle in the 17th century.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to the increased town and rural population and agricultural specialization, Coon Rapids saw the appearance of service industries to support the changing farm economy. There were carpenters specializing in farm building construction, <b>well</b> <b>diggers,</b> tiling and drainage concerns, dealers in cement {{and other types of}} fencing, a creamery to support the burgeoning dairy and poultry industry. By the early twentieth century, Coon Rapids was the dominant trading center between Perry and Manning. The downtown was filled with two and three storey brick buildings and offered an array of shops, services, and amenities such as an opera house, bowling alley, restaurants, a hotel and other amusements. From a simple market and trading point, Coon Rapids had become the economic, social, recreational and service center for the four county areas. It continued in this role despite the fall in farm values in the late teens and Great Depression of the 1930s.|$|R

It is estimated {{that there were more}} than one million miners working outside the formal sector nationwide. Many suffered violence from guards and security forces for illegally entering mining concessions.|$|R
50|$|In the 1930s, {{the era of}} the Great Depression, {{the city}} of Hanover lacked the {{necessary}} finance for the commencement of the Maschsee project, even though the project had already been planned some ten years earlier. The project was favourable for the Nazi Party that came to power in January 1933 as it would help reduce unemployment levels, which was a central theme of their propaganda. On 28 November 1933 the project was approved {{at a meeting of the}} city council. On 21 March 1934 the first ground was broken in the Leine swamp. Despite the unsettled financing of the project, it provided many people with work. Driven by the harshness of the economic situation of the time, they took on tough working conditions and low pay which was barely much higher than unemployment support. During construction fourteen locomotive trains with 365 tipping wagons were used along a 15 km track as <b>well</b> as <b>diggers</b> and five crawler tractors. Many workers though had to supply their own tools. Initially there were 100 people working on the project, but by its completion 1,650 people had been involved to excavate roughly 780,000 square metres of earth to create the lake basin. With the Maschsee project fully completed by early 1936, the official opening took place on 21 May 1936. Hundreds of thousands of Hanoverians and guests looked on from the edge of the lake as the event began with the then-typical trooping of the Nazi Party. In addition some 6,000 sporting persons took part in a rally along with the armed forces and public officials. During World War II the lake was covered up with canvasses and fake landscapes created on floating islands created, in an attempt to confuse Allied bomber pilots of their whereabouts during air raids on Hanover.|$|R
40|$|NASA s {{plans for}} a lunar outpost require {{extensive}} excavation. The Lunar Surface Systems Project Office projects that {{thousands of tons of}} lunar soil will need to be moved. Conventional excavators dig through soil by brute force, and depend upon their substantial weight to react to the forces generated. This approach will not be feasible on the Moon for two reasons: (1) gravity is 1 / 6 th that on Earth, which means that a kg on the Moon will supply 1 / 6 the down force that it does on Earth, and (2) transportation costs (at the time of this reporting) of $ 50 K to $ 100 K per kg make massive excavators economically unattractive. A percussive excavation system was developed for use in vacuum or nearvacuum environments. It reduces the down force needed for excavation by an order of magnitude by using percussion to assist in soil penetration and digging. The novelty of this excavator is that it incorporates a percussive mechanism suited to sustained operation in a vacuum environment. A percussive digger breadboard was designed, built, and successfully tested under both ambient and vacuum conditions. The breadboard was run in vacuum to more than 2 [...] times the lifetime of the Apollo Lunar Surface Drill, throughout which the mechanism performed and held up <b>well.</b> The percussive <b>digger</b> was demonstrated to reduce the force necessary for digging in lunar soil simulant by an order of magnitude, providing reductions as high as 45 : 1. This is an enabling technology for lunar site preparation and ISRU (In Situ Resource Utilization) mining activities. At transportation costs of $ 50 K to $ 100 K per kg, reducing digging forces by an order of magnitude translates into billions of dollars saved by not launching heavier systems to accomplish excavation tasks necessary to the establishment of a lunar outpost. Applications on the lunar surface include excavation for habitats, construction of roads, landing pads, berms, foundations, habitat shielding, and ISRU...|$|R
