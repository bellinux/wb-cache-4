40|$|A {{series of}} test roofs clad with radiata pine (Pinus radiata D. Don) {{shingles}} {{that had been}} pressure-treated with various <b>water-borne</b> <b>preservative</b> formula-tions were installed at a Forest Research Institute test site in Rotorua in 1977. A further series of test roofs installed in 1978 included radiata pine shingles pressure-treated with a commercial light organic solvent preservative. Evaluation of selected radiata pine shingle test roofs in early 1984 showed that, although preservative leaching had occurred from shingles treated with an alkyl ammonium compound, a copper-chrome-arsenic preservative, and a light organic solvent preservative, the shingles appeared sound when examined microscopically. Slight lichen growth was evident on some shingles. In contrast, untreated radiata pine shingles displayed marked fungal infection, early stages of decay, and plentiful mould and lichen growth. Untreated western red cedar (Thuja plicata D. Don) shingles, which were used as a reference point from which to judge radiata pine shingles, showed lichen and mould growth after 7 years' exposure. Checking and cupping of western red cedar shingles were attributable {{in part to the}} inclusion of some flat-sawn material...|$|E

Results showed that the bar force loss already reached almost the maximum 60 % level within less than a year. One reason {{is the use of}} a <b>water-borne</b> <b>preservative</b> for the preliminary pressure treatment of the glulam members. There were large variations in the humidity within 24 -hr spans which resulted to corresponding changes in the bar force. The maximum deflection under the test truck positioned longitudinally at the center of each span in the downstream lane was 8. 4 mm (L/ 2400) on the downstream side tie member which is smaller than L/ 500, the maximum allowable deflection for steel bridges. The deflections are greater when the truck is positioned at the downstream side than those when the truck is positioned at the longitudinal centerline. There is a good agreement between measured and the estimated values using FEM. The maximum deflection under the test truck positioned longitudinally at the center of each span in the downstream lane was 2. 72 mm which is equal to 1 / 1. 56 of the design deflection value of the deck...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} shows that {{isolates}} of P. vitreus have an extraordinary capacity to induce substantial permeability changes in heartwood of P. abies without causing significant losses in impact bending strength. The degradation of pit membranes by P. vitreus is an important aspect that could also have significant benefits in wood protection processes.

40|$|Douglas fir {{roundwood}} in New Zealand {{is currently}} {{not used in}} high decay situations because the heartwood is not sufficiently durable and the sapwood is not permeable to <b>water-borne</b> <b>preservatives.</b> The results in this study have confirmed that during water-storage of wood, bacteria selectively attack pit membranes, improving permeability, which leads to enhanced preservative uptake. To optimise conditions for bacterial growth and distribution within wood, the effects of temperature, nutrient supplements, pH and incising/kerfing were investigated during the sprinkling of short Douglas fir bolts in small tanks. For water-sprinkling to be commercially acceptable the treatment time must be as brief as possible. Bacterial access to the wood is an important limiting factor. Tangential movement of bacteria in wood {{was found to be}} more rapid than radial movement and so the effect of incising or kerfing on bacterial access was investigated. Kerfing provided an ideal pathway for tangential entry into wood. Nutrient supplements in the sprinkling solution, particularly nitrogen and phosphate together, enhanced bacterial growth and enzyme activity, reducing the time required to achieve total sapwood preservative penetration. Sprinkling had no effect on heartwood permeability. Sprinkling treatments also influenced the drying characteristics of Douglas fir. Short sprinkling times (1 - 4 weeks) reduced radial and tangential drying rates. Longer sprinkling times improved the rate of drying. Shrinkage measurements were made on small cubes cut from sprinkled wood. Tangential shrinkage was reduced but radial shrinkage was unaffected; this should reduce the incidence of checking in water-sprinkled wood...|$|R
30|$|Wood {{preservation}} {{with either}} oil-borne or <b>water-borne</b> <b>preservatives</b> can eliminate biological attack by fungi, insects and termites and can increase mechanical strength [8]. However, no single preservative is available {{that can provide}} all the desired kinds of protection. Though the natural durability of wood offers {{a certain degree of}} resistance to wood degrading agents, there is evidently no ideal wood species that can be used universally in any application without eventual break-down [9]. As a result, a wide range of techniques and methods have been developed for wood preservation [10 – 13]. Preservation {{is an important part of}} wood technology, encompassing every process of chemical or physical treatment that is undertaken to extend the service life of wood by optimizing its resistance to biological attack, fire, shrinkage and swelling due to changes in MC. One of the greatest advantages of wood treatment is that it reduces the ability of wood to absorb moisture and thus improves its dimensional stability. Water repelling characteristics have been shown to increase after the impregnation of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) sapwood with linseed oil [14], coconut oil and various tall oils [15]. Even though the decreased hygroscopicity in heat-treated wood is reported to increase decay resistance [16 – 18], thermally modified wood is not found to be suitable for ground contact outdoor applications [3, 19]. The decay resistance depends on several factors, such as wood species, treatment method and exposure conditions. For example, a noticeably lower mass loss due to fungal attack is observed for oil–heat-treated wood compared with air–heat-treated wood [20]. Nevertheless, heat-treated wood is found to be susceptible to termites as well as marine borers [21, 22]. No single method has been shown to protect wood from all types of biodegradation. Thus, heat treatment in combination with oil can provide more effective protection than single treatment methods alone [13, 20].|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Substantial {{progress}} has been made in remediation of preservative treated waste wood by chemical extraction with several mineral and organic acids and biodegradation using bacteria and fungi in recent years. Non-conventional low-cost adsorbents are used to bind the metal ions in extremely stable complexes in heavy metal contaminated soils or polluted waters and thus to remediate such substrates. In this study, various adsorbents from industrial and agricultural processes were evaluated in removal of copper, chromium, and arsenic from chromated copper arsenate (CCA) - treated wood by using batch extracting experiments. Most adsorbents used in the study had the potential to remove copper ele-ment from CCA-treated wood, while chromium was the most resistant element against removal in most cases. In general, as amount of adsorbents in the extraction process and extraction duration increased, the percentage of elements removed increased. The adsorbents used in the study could be important in the remediation of wood treated with organic or <b>water-borne</b> wood <b>preservatives</b> containing copper since the use of the adsorbents is one key to unfix copper from treated wood treated...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to search for appropriate low-toxicity preservatives to be used as green colour protectors for makino bamboo (Phyllostachys makinoi) culms, and to find appropriate conditions and process, especially an alkali-pretreatment-free and a solvent-free process, for treating makino bamboo to achieve green colour protection. The influence of various green colour protection reagents and treatment conditions on the colour of bamboo culms was examined using a colour difference meter. Two <b>water-borne</b> copper-based <b>preservatives,</b> namely ammoniacal copper quaternary compound-type B (ACQ-B) and copper azole (CuAz), were tested as protectors. In addition to heating in a water bath, the ultrasonic heating method was also employed. Results revealed that, without alkali-pretreatment, an excellent green colour protection (a) Z 11. 0) was obtained when the makino bamboo culms were treated with 2 % aqueous ACQ-B solution in a 60 C water bath for 1 h, and that CuAz has no effect on green colour protection (a) Z 3. 9) under the same conditions. Compared with conventional heating in a water bath, improvement on the green colour protection can be achieved with a shorter treatment time by using ultrasonic heating. The a) value of bamboo culms after the treatment with 2 % ACQ-B at a 60 C ultrasonic bath for 15 min was 10. 0...|$|R
40|$|Notes: Includes: A. Natural decay {{resistance}} of wood [...] B. Laboratory evaluation of wood preservatives [...] C. Preservative tolerance of wood-destroying fungi© 1977 Dr. Edwin Warner Brandon Da CostaThe researches {{described in the}} attached papers followed a prolonged period of change and development. The initial purpose was to evaluate in the laboratory the probable durability of Australian timbers in service as poles, posts, sleepers and so on. (Papers A 1, A 2, A 3, A 4). These papers were {{at the time of}} publication more rigorous and comprehensive than any published tests. (In this connection, {{it should be noted that}} the “Progress Report” series of the Division of Forest Products were distributed to all known major research workers in the field, abstracted in major abstracting journals, and freely cited in publications. Divisional policy was at that time opposed to publication of results in scientific journals, rather than specialized reports with “targeted” distribution). They were especially notable in the variety of test fungi used; in the development of testing techniques which would allow decay in dense timbers (based on extensive so far unpublished experiments on varying technique parameters); in the use of statistical analyses; and in recognition that no single value can be assigned to “natural durability”, a theme developed in A 14, my final definitive paper on natural durability, which should be a seminal paper for future work in this field. A major contribution has been the clear understanding that weight losses in decay tests cannot have any absolute value and that tests are essentially comparative. Classification of natural durability is therefore best obtained, not by arbitrary classification on weight losses, but by close comparison with “yardstick” timbers whose durability is thoroughly familiar. (A 11, A 12, A 14). These papers, and several unpublished experiments of the same nature, contributed largely to the lists of natural durability of timbers published by the Division of Forest Products and used in Australian Standards (e. g. As 1604 – 1974, on preservation of sawn timber). Similar inter-species comparisons were later made of Papua New Guinea timbers (A 11) where information on natural durability, vital to effective utilization of mixed hardwood rain forests, was virtually absent. From this work on inter-species variation in durability, there came an interest in the causes of this variation and this was investigated for several years in collaboration with Dr. P. Rudman (A 3, A 4, A 7, A 9, A 10). The initial and critical paper in this series (A 3) was a seminal paper in being the first paper to adopt a “toxicity balance” approach, in which the decay {{resistance of}} untreated wood, of extracted wood, and of susceptible wood containing these extractives was measured. This was important because previous workers had concentrated on the toxicity of specific extractives as the explanation of durability, neglecting the possibility that the wood might still be durable after complete removal of these extractives, due to other extractives or to physical factors. My approach also took account of the detoxification of extractives during removal and of the effect of their original distribution in the wood. The paper also contained the first description of a reliable and precise technique for determining decay resistance of wood meal of a variety of species. Since adequate extraction required conversion of wood to a finely-divided form, this technique was essential and was unexpectedly difficult to develop. The general design of the work the decay technique, the decay tests and interpretation of the results were the work of the senior author. This line of work on chemical reasons for decay resistance was gradually transferred to Dr. Rudman. Because of the reputation acquired from earlier work on natural durability, work on natural durability of teak (Tectona grandee) was requested by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. This was concerned with relative durability of plantation-grown and natural teak and with possible detrimental effects of high growth rates on durability. The resultant work (A 5, A 6, A 7, A 8) showed that the widely held belief that fast frown timber was less durable was, at best, only partially true. The papers were important in describing some of the few attempts to test this experimentally and in pioneering multiple regression analyses to assess the relative importance of silvicultural, factors in durability of teak and the potential importance of decay resistance testing in selection and breeding of teak and other timbers. The early stages of my research in wood pathology were confined to natural durability, but with the establishment and rapid growth of a pressure-impregnation wood preservation industry in Australia, and the world-wide need for more sophisticated treatments, my research activities changed to study of chemically enhanced decay resistance. After some preliminary investigations to solve urgent problems (B 1, B 2, B 3), they took the form of an intensive study of <b>water-borne</b> <b>preservatives</b> (especially copper-chrome-arsenic preservatives or “CCA”) and factors affecting their efficiency (B 4, B 5, B 6, B 7, B 16, B 19); and also a study of factors affecting the performance of Australian [?] (B 8, B 10, B 11, B 12, B 18, B 20). CCA studies were important as being the most comprehensive studies to that date of fixed <b>water-borne</b> <b>preservatives</b> (B 6) and as the first to discuss the effect of wood substrate on preservative performance (B 7), a topic of international recognition in the 1970 ’s. My demonstration of the enormous variation in CCA tolerance of basidiomycete wood-destroying fungi (C 1) led to a fundamental study of fungal tolerance (c 4, C 5, C 6). This included the original discovery that basidiomycete cultures could be dedikaryotized by toxic agents (C 2, C 3) a discovery of considerable importance to general biology and experimental fungal taxonomy, as well as to wood pathology (C 5). My later discovery that the toxic effects of arsenic could be antidote by phosphate (B 16, C 7, C 8, B 19, B 21) is also one of fundamental importance to general biology, as well as to wood pathology, especially to techniques of standard testing of wood preservatives (C 7, C 8). The research on creosote established conclusively that removal of phenols from low temperature creosotes lowered their efficiency and led directly to a revision of the Standards Association of Australia specification for creosote (despite considerable opposition from manufacturers). The work on use of propylene oxide for sterilization (B 10, B 11) had important implications in view of its widespread use in laboratory tearing (e. g. in British Standard 338; 1961). I was probably the first worker to use propylene oxide as a sterilant for wood specimens (B 3, C 1) and have much unpublished data on its use, as well as the best statement to date (B 11) of its limitations. Apart from work on CCA and on creosotes, I studied various organic solvent preservatives (B 9, B 13 < B 14) and also studied the use of special techniques for preservation of plywood (B 15, B 17). In general, these papers are regarded as making a substantial contribution to the science of wood pathology and of biodeterioration as well as having had some influence in the application of wood preservation technology in Australia and overseas. Many of the papers (e. g. A 1, A 3, A 8, A 10, A 11, A 14, B 6, B 9, B 17, B 20, C 1, C 2, C 5, C 6, C 7) introduced novel concepts and techniques.

40|$|The {{relationships}} {{of difference in}} rate of drying to permeability and wood structure were determined for two angiosperms and one gymnosperm. These investigations took two particular drying problems {{as a basis for}} study and attempted to explain why: - heartwood of Nothofagus fusca (red beech) takes many times longer to dry than sapwood. - green sapwood of Pinus radiata (radiata pine) dries readily but, if dried and pressure-treated with <b>water-borne</b> <b>preservatives,</b> its subsequent drying is greatly retarded. Test material was used from 14 trees of N. fusca from New Zealand, four trees of Eucalyptus regnans (mountain ash) and seven trees of P. radiata from Victoria, Australia and the experimental work was carried out under three headings: (a) Unidirectional drying. Small specimens, sealed on all except one pair of grain faces, were dried in a laboratory kiln at temperatures up to 60 C. Comparisons were made between radial and tangential drying in sapwood and heartwood or in green and resaturated specimens; effects of treatments such as steaming were also assessed. Moisture gradients were determined to show the contribution of free water movement to overall drying. (b) Permeability studies. A method was developed to measure the transverse permeability of green wood to the flow of micro-filtered water; established methods were used for longitudinal permeability. Data for P. radiata met the requirements allowing application of Darcy's Law for flow of fluids through inert porous media and N. fusca approximated them. Pathways of flow were determined with chemical stains. (c) Wood structure. The transmission electron microscope was used to compare the appearance of pit membranes and the cell walls in sapwood and heartwood of N. fusca. In P. radiata, emphasis was on determining the percentage of bordered pits that were aspirated in sapwood - green, after drying and resaturation and after various treatments - and relating this to differences in drying and permeability. The main conclusions drawn from this study are: (a) The green sapwood of N. fusca and E. regnans is permeable to micro-filtered water in the radial and tangential directions. After drying and resaturation, the permeability of N. fusca is unchanged but that of E. regnans is drastically reduced, particularly in the tangential direction. The heartwood of both species is impermeable when tested at a pressure differential of 40 cm. Hg. (b) Differences in the permeability of N. fusca can be explained by differences in the appearance of pit membranes in sapwood and heartwood: in heartwood, the membrane surfaces are usually completely occluded when viewed as replicas in a transmission electron microscope; in sapwood, the surfaces are always less occluded often exhibiting a clean primary well texture. It is inferred from studying the effects of various extraction treatments that the pit membrane surfaces in sapwood are less occluded than indicated by the appearance of replicas. (c) Plasmodesmata may provide pathways for mass movement of liquids in the radial direction in the wood, but, in other pits, without obvious pores, permeability probably results from movement through the general structure of the pit membrane. (d) Heartwood of N. fusca takes several times longer to dry than sapwood because of its reduced permeability coupled with lower rates of moisture diffusion. (e) Contrary to previous reports, at least 80 percent of the bordered pits in green sapwood of P. radiata are open, irrespective of distance from the outside of the tree. After drying and resaturation most pits are aspirated and the wood is much less permeable than in the green state. (f) The condition of the bordered pits has an effect on the rate of drying in the tangential direction - causing a marked reduction in resaturated material - but has no appreciable effect on radial drying which is little different in green or resaturated wood.
