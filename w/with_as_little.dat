5|$|Bardou-Jacquet {{wanted to}} compose the {{advertisement}} <b>with</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> computer-generated imagery as possible, {{believing that the}} final product would be that much more appealing to its audience. To this end, he set two months aside {{for the creation of}} hundreds of conceptual drawings detailing various possible interactions between the parts, and a further four months for practical testing and development. For the testing phase, the script was broken into small segments, each comprising only one or two interactions. Ideas deemed unworkable by the testing crew, such as airbag explosions and collisions between front and rear sections of the car, were abandoned, and the remaining segments were slowly brought together until the full and final sequence was developed.|$|E
5|$|On April 8, 2014, Microsoft {{released}} the Windows 8.1 Update, which included all past updates plus new features. It was unveiled by Microsoft vice president Joe Belfiore at Mobile World Congress on February 23, 2014, and detailed in full at Microsoft's Build conference on April 2. Belfiore {{noted that the}} update would lower the minimum system requirements for Windows, {{so it can be}} installed on devices <b>with</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> as 1GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. Unlike Windows 8.1 itself, this cumulative update is distributed through Windows Update, and must be installed in order to receive any further patches for Windows 8.1.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} was initially {{powered by the}} Pegasus 6 engine which {{was replaced by the}} more powerful Pegasus 11 during the Harrier GR.1 to GR.3 upgrade process. The primary focus throughout the engine's development was on achieving high performance <b>with</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> weight as possible, tempered by the amount of funding that was available. Following the Harrier's entry to service the focus switched to improving reliability and extending engine life; a formal joint US–UK Pegasus Support Program operated for many years and spent a £3-million annual budget to develop engine improvements. Several variants have been released; the latest is the Pegasus 11–61 (Mk 107), which provides 23,800lbf (106kN) thrust, more than any previous engine.|$|E

5|$|These words {{indicate}} that Tong Yabghu {{was eager to}} retain control of the westernmost portion of the Silk Route, as he tightened his grip of its other segments all the way east to China. In April 630 Böri Shad determined to expand his control of Transcaucasia and sent his general Chorpan Tarkhan <b>with</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> as 30,000 cavalry to invade Armenia. Using a characteristic ploy of nomadic warriors, Chorpan Tarkhan ambushed and annihilated a Persian force of 10,000 dispatched by Shahrbaraz to counter the invasion. Turks knew the Sassanid response would be harsh, they plundered cities and withdrew their forces back to the steppes.|$|E
5|$|Uranium is more {{plentiful}} than antimony, tin, cadmium, mercury, or silver, and it {{is about}} as abundant as arsenic or molybdenum. Uranium is found in hundreds of minerals, including uraninite (the most common uranium ore), carnotite, autunite, uranophane, torbernite, and coffinite. Significant concentrations of uranium occur in some substances such as phosphate rock deposits, and minerals such as lignite, and monazite sands in uranium-rich ores (it is recovered commercially from sources <b>with</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> as 0.1% uranium).|$|E
5|$|Winfield Scott, the {{commanding}} {{general of the}} U.S. Army {{at the beginning of}} the war, devised the Anaconda Plan to win the war <b>with</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> bloodshed as possible. His idea was that a Union blockade of the main ports would weaken the Confederate economy; then the capture of the Mississippi River would split the South. Lincoln adopted the plan in terms of a blockade to squeeze to death the Confederate economy, but overruled Scott's warnings that his new army was not ready for an offensive operation because public opinion demanded an immediate attack.|$|E

25|$|The {{boats that}} are used for {{trawling}} are called trawlers or draggers. Trawlers vary in size from small open boats <b>with</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> as 30 hp (22 kW) engines to large factory trawlers with over 10,000hp (7.5 MW). Trawling {{can be carried out}} by one trawler or by two trawlers fishing cooperatively (pair trawling).|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} {{hydration}} shells is well {{developed in the}} physical chemistry literature however a simple model is required that captures the essential effects <b>with</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> computational overhead as possible. For this purpose the same pairwise potential discussed by Im and Roux is implemented to include the effect of hydration shells.|$|E

25|$|The International Organisation of Biological Control (IOBC) {{describes}} Integrated Farming {{according to}} the UNI 11233-2009 European standard as a farming system where high quality organic food, feed, fibre and renewable energy are produced by using resources such as soil, water, air and nature as well as regulating factors to farm sustainably and <b>with</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> polluting inputs as possible.|$|E
25|$|By early 1861, General Winfield Scott had {{devised the}} Anaconda Plan {{to win the}} war <b>with</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> bloodshed as possible. Scott argued that a Union {{blockade}} of the main ports would weaken the Confederate economy. Lincoln adopted parts of the plan, but he overruled Scott's caution about 90-day volunteers. Public opinion, however, demanded an immediate attack by the army to capture Richmond.|$|E
25|$|After TVR {{extended}} the deadline of competing entries, {{it had been}} rumoured that the broadcaster had received very few extries for the contest, <b>with</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> as five entries being reported. However, TVR rebuked this claim, confirming that they had received over 250 entries for the contest. 24 entries were selected by a special panel {{to compete in the}} two semi-finals on 8 January 2009, and were released on 9 January.|$|E

25|$|Hydrogen {{fluoride}} gas is {{an acute}} poison that may immediately and permanently damage lungs and the corneas of the eyes. Aqueous hydrofluoric acid is a contact-poison {{with the potential}} for deep, initially painless burns and ensuing tissue death. By interfering with body calcium metabolism, the concentrated acid may also cause systemic toxicity and eventual cardiac arrest and fatality, after contact <b>with</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> as 160cm2 (25 square inches) of skin.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, it {{is capable}} of greater {{work-hardening}} than is the case with pure copper, so that it performs better when used for cutting or chopping. There is an increase in work-hardening capability with increasing percentage of arsenic, and it can be work-hardened over a wide range of temperatures without fear of embrittlement. Its improved properties over pure copper can be seen <b>with</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> as 0.5 to 2wt% As, giving a 10 to 30% improvement in hardness and tensile strength.|$|E
25|$|The heavy {{armor plates}} {{required}} {{to build the}} two monitors forced the company to upgrade its ironworking facilities, leaving it <b>with</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> as $25,000 to $30,000 in working capital. The shortage of capital {{may have contributed to}} the fact that, of all the companies contracted to build Passaic class monitors, Reaney, Son & Archbold was the last to make delivery, which was achieved respectively in February and April 1863. With a displacement of 1,875 tons apiece, these would be the two largest-tonnage vessels ever built by the company.|$|E

25|$|Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow, {{better known}} as 'Bonny and Clyde' (active February 1932 – May 1934), were an American couple who went on a crime spree during the Great Depression with their gang, the Barrow Gang. They were best known for {{capturing}} the public's imagination with their image as a wild young couple. Along with their gang, they were credited with only ten bank robberies, often making away <b>with</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> as $80. They were eventually ambushed and killed on the roadside outside Bienville Parish, Louisiana by a posse of Texas and Louisiana lawmen.|$|E
25|$|Hayek {{was one of}} {{the leading}} {{academic}} critics of collectivism in the 20th century. Hayek argued that all forms of collectivism (even those theoretically based on voluntary co-operation) could only be maintained by a central authority of some kind. In Hayek's view, the central role of the state should be to maintain the rule of law, <b>with</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> arbitrary intervention as possible. In his popular book, The Road to Serfdom (1944) and in subsequent academic works, Hayek argued that socialism required central economic planning and that such planning in turn leads towards totalitarianism.|$|E
25|$|The SAT {{became known}} in Japanese media again when its Fukuoka branch {{took part in}} recapturing a hijacked bus in Fukuoka in the Neomugicha {{incident}} in 2000, capturing the lone hijacker alive. The hijacking event showcased the SAT's dedication {{to protect the public}} with their counter-terrorist skills in subduing felons such as criminals and terrorists <b>with</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> force as possible, although it was suggested that the SAT captured the hijacker was because of the rules implemented in the Law Concerning Execution of Duties of Police Officials, which doesn't allow any police officer to fire their weapons except for situations that require self-defense.|$|E
