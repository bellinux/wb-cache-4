500|$|A second crisis arose on 30 July 1832. A {{constitutional}} amendment effecting greater reforms was voted on and approved in the Chamber of Deputies, but still faced major {{opposition in the}} Senate. Diogo Antônio Feijó and Aureliano Coutinho, both Moderates, planned a coup d'état. Feijó would assume dictatorial powers and immediately enact the {{constitutional amendment}}, thus bypassing the Senate entirely. Honório Hermeto called on his fellow deputies to uphold the Constitution: [...] "We need not hurt the legal order and [...] principles: we can make fair laws ... and in the respected Constitution we have safe and legal ways of giving the nation <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>wants...</b> let us not violate it , as it is our only safeguard." [...] He rallied the deputies to his view, and in defeating the unconstitutional proposal, the coup attempt was crushed.|$|E

[...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle enjoyed the film, asking his readers [...] "... {{if you can find}} a better time at the movies this year than this wild comic thriller, let me in on it." [...] Boston Globe reviewer Ty Burr reacted to Samuel L. Jackson's performance by saying he [...] "... bestrides this film with the authority of someone who knows the value of honest bilge.

500|$|Bird later {{recalled}} that he clashed with executives {{who wished to}} add characters, such as a sidekick dog, set the film in the present day, and include a soundtrack of hip hop. This was due to concerns that the film was not merchandisable, to which Bird responded, [...] "If {{they were interested in}} telling the story, they should let it be <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>wants</b> to be." [...] The film was also initially going to released under the Warner Bros. Family Entertainment banner, the logo for which featured mascot Bugs Bunny in a tuxedo. Bird was against this for a multitude of reasons, and eventually got confirmation that executives Bob Daley and Terry Semel agreed. Instead, Bird and his team developed another version of the logo to resemble the classic studio logo in a circle, famously employed in Looney Tunes shorts. He credited executives Lorenzo di Bonaventura and Courtney Vallenti with helping him achieve his vision, noting that they were open to his opinion.|$|E

He praised Townshend for deliberately constructing the album so that each song can be enjoyed individually and felt that {{he is determined to}} [...] "give his audience <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>wants</b> without burying his own peculiarity". Albert Goldman, writing in Life magazine, said that The Who play through [...] "all the kinky complications" [...] of the narrative in a hard rock style that is the antithesis of most contemporary [...] "serious" [...] rock. Goldman asserted that, based on innovation, performance, and [...] "sheer power", Tommy surpasses anything else in studio-recorded rock. Christgau named Tommy the best album of 1969 in his year-end list for Jazz & Pop magazine.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, detractors {{targeted}} the film's direction of storyline and structure. In his review for The New York Times, Harold C.

He describes Peruchazhi as a spoof about how a politician from Kerala ends up being the chief political adviser to a state election campaign in California and the havoc he creates while chasing success there. Since Vaidyanathan wanted the protagonist to have international appeal, he named him [...] "Ulaganathan" [...] (conqueror of the world) in his original Tamil script; in Malayalam the name was changed to [...] "Jagannathan", its meaning unchanged.|$|E

2500|$|On November 15, 2007, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 10–9 along {{party lines}} to send an {{alternative}} measure to the full Senate {{other than the one}} the intelligence committee had crafted with the White House.

Judiciary Committee chairman Patrick Leahy said that granting such immunity would give the Bush administration a [...] "blank check" [...] to do <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>wants</b> without regard to the law.

2500|$|The cost of {{maintaining}} the old structure had become prohibitive, so it was considered easier to demolish the old Pennsylvania Station by 1963 {{and replace it with}} Penn Plaza and Madison Square Garden. As a New York Times editorial critical of the demolition noted at the time, a [...] "city gets <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>wants,</b> is willing to pay for, and ultimately deserves." [...] Modern architects rushed to save the ornate building, although it was contrary to their own styles. They called the station a treasure and chanted [...] "Don't Amputate– Renovate" [...] at rallies. Demolition of the above-ground station house began in October 1963. As most of the rail infrastructure was below street level, including the waiting room, concourses, and boarding platforms, rail service was maintained throughout demolition with only minor disruptions. Madison Square Garden, along with two office towers were built above the extensively renovated concourses and waiting area (the tracks and boarding platforms were not modified at this time). A 1968 advertisement depicted architect Charles Luckman's model of the final plan for the Madison Square Garden Center complex.|$|E
