In the GA, a population of candidate solutions, called chromosomes, containing low objective function values are selected from a random population [31, 32]. These selected chromosomes change their elements, called genes, through crossover or mutation processes to produce offspring chromosomes [33]. Then, these offspring chromosomes are evaluated by the objective function and selected to evolve the population if they could provide better solutions than <b>weak</b> <b>population</b> members do [34]. In the crossover process, selected chromosomes containing better solutions exchange parts of their information to produce offspring chromosomes [35].

In areas with a late food peak, early-breeding birds still breed at the right time, and there is, at most, a <b>weak</b> <b>population</b> decline. If food phenology advances further, we also predict population declines in areas with a late food peak, as in these areas adjustment to an advanced food peak is insufficient(4).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{northern}} {{fur seal}} (Callorhinus ursinus; NFS) is a widely distributed pinniped that {{has been shown to}} exhibit a high degree of philopatry to islands, breeding areas on an island, and even to specific segments of breeding areas. This level of philopatry could conceivably lead to highly genetically divergent populations. However, {{northern fur seal}}s have the potential for dispersal across large distances and have experienced repeated rapid population expansions following glacial retreat and the more recent cessation of intensive harvest pressure. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using microsatellite and mitochondrial loci, we examined population structure in NFS throughout their range. We found only <b>weak</b> <b>population</b> genetic structure among breeding islands including significant F(ST) and Phi(ST) values between eastern and western Pacific islands.

40|$|Population genetic {{studies of}} {{widespread}} Mediterranean shrubs are scarce {{compared with those}} of trees and narrow endemics or studies from phylogeographical perspectives, despite the key role these species may play in Mediterranean ecosystems. Knowledge on the effect of ecological factors in shaping their genetic patterns is also limited. In this study we investigate genetic diversity and population structure across 18 populations of Rosmarinus officinalis, a Mediterranean shrubland plant. Populations were sampled along two elevational gradients, one each on calcareous and siliceous soils in a mountain system in the eastern Iberian Peninsula, to decipher the effect of ecological factors on the genetic diversity and structure based on 11 microsatellite loci. We found overall high levels of genetic diversity and <b>weak</b> <b>population</b> structure. Genetic diversity increased with elevation, whereas population differentiation was stronger among populations growing on siliceous soils. The nested analysis of elevational gradients within soil types revealed that these general patterns were mostly driven by siliceous populations, whereas calcareous populations were more homogeneous along elevational belts. Bayesian analysis of population structure revealed genetic membership of lowland and high-elevation populations to different genetic clusters and a higher admixture of intermediate-elevation populations to both clusters. High-elevation populations were less differentiated from a hypothetical ancestral cluster, suggesting the persistence of their gene pool during the Pleistocene glaciations. In contrast, lowland populations resulted from more recent divergence. We propose that life-history and reproductive traits mostly contribute to explain the high levels of genetic diversity and <b>weak</b> <b>population</b> structure, whereas ecological and historical factors mostly contribute to the stronger differentiation of siliceous populations and a rapid expansion of R. officinalis on calcareous soils possibly mediated by human landscape transformations, © 2015 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2016, 180, 50 - 63.

However, in practice, the unit mis-classification cost, such {{as the cost of}} mis-classifying a strong component as weak, cannot be estimated precisely.
