5|$|Segments {{are further}} divided into work areas, {{indicated}} by brackets {{in the list}} above. Work {{is scheduled to begin}} in Segments 2 and 4 and proceed from north to south within each segment before moving on to Segments 1 and 3. The first work area will be in the cities of South San Francisco and San Bruno. Within each work area, the first activity will be tree pruning and removal (scheduled duration, two months) followed by construction of the foundations for the overhead contact system poles (scheduled duration, three to five months). Once the foundations are complete, construction of the traction power substation (estimated at twelve months in duration) and pole and wire installation (estimated at three months) <b>will</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> parallel. Schedules have been announced for Segment 2, Work Areas 5 (South City/San Bruno), 4 (Millbrae/Burlingame), and 3 (San Mateo). Traction power substations have been confirmed for South San Francisco and Burlingame, with another traction power substation in the city of San Mateo at a site yet to be named.|$|E

Wildlife management in the airport environment can be grouped into two broad categories: non-lethal and lethal. Integration of multiple non-lethal methods with lethal methods results in the most effective airfield wildlife management strategy.|$|E

25|$|A working Kangal on duty will station {{itself on}} a high vantage point {{overlooking}} its flock. On hot days, the dog will dig itself a hollow in the ground to keep cool. Novices learn by staying close to older dogs.

The intensity of their patrols around the sheep increases at nightfall.|$|E
25|$|The reach method, (or hose trace method), is {{the most}} {{reliable}} as it <b>will</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> all cases where the DV is not snagged somewhere. The diver reaches back over the right shoulder to the low pressure hose feeding the DV, and loops thumb and fingers round the hose, then slides the hand along the hose, pulling it forward and over the shoulder until the DV is in the right hand, at which stage it can be turned the right way round and replaced in the mouth.|$|E

25|$|Half of the Bangladesh's 12 million tube wells contain {{unacceptable}} {{levels of}} arsenic {{due to the}} wells not being dug deep enough (past 100 metres). The Bangladeshi government had spent less than US$7 million of the 34 million allocated for solving the problem by the World Bank in 1998. Natural arsenic poisoning is a global threat, 140 million people affected in 70 countries on all continents. These examples illustrate the need to examine each location {{on a case by}} case basis and not assume what works in one area <b>will</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> another.|$|E
25|$|The National Academy of Sciences {{released}} a report in 2004 supporting the use of clinical studies under strict regulations; the regulations mandated that the study's benefit to society outweigh the risk to the individual, that the study be conducted under a strict ethical code, that there be reasonable certainty that no harm will come to participants {{and that it has}} been shown that no other study <b>will</b> <b>work.</b> <b>In</b> 2005, adhering to a congressional directive, the EPA adopted the Human Studies Regulation; the regulations permit human studies, do not allow the use of pregnant women or children in human studies, mandate that a strict ethical code be followed and establish a Human Studies Review Board to oversee the use of human studies. The EPA considers the regulations as a major accomplishment in public policy.|$|E
25|$|Existing drum kits from Rock Band, Guitar Hero, {{and other}} games, {{including}} the ION electronic drum kits, {{can be used}} for Basic mode play in Rock Band 3. For Pro drums, a three cymbal-pad set is added to the core drum kit; notes on screen are marked as a rounded note instead of rectangular to indicate a cymbal hit instead of a drum hit. MadCatz and other manufacturers already produced a cymbal add-ons for Rock Band 2 drum kits, but introduced a new version with the release of Rock Band 3. The player can optionally use 1 or 2 additional cymbal pads, configuring the Pro Drums mode to only recognize those. Players can also add a second foot pedal and configure the game to act as a second bass drum pedal or as a hi-hat pedal. Additionally, existing ION drum kits <b>will</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> Pro mode for Rock Band 3.|$|E

50|$|Today, torchère lamps use {{fluorescent}} or halogen light bulbs. Halogen torchères {{usually have}} a TRIAC dimmer circuit built into the stem. The same circuit <b>will</b> not <b>work</b> <b>in</b> a fluorescent torchère {{for the same reason}} that it <b>will</b> not <b>work</b> <b>in</b> other types of fluorescent applications: namely, because the pulsing will cause the arc in the fluorescent tube to become erratic. This is overcome by adjusting the pulse-width modulation in the electronic ballast instead; and most fluorescent torchères use this method.|$|R

In February 2011, Activision decided to shutter their Guitar Hero development, and initially stated that no further downloadable content will be forthcoming. Due to [...] "continued support" [...] from their fanbase, Activision has since decided {{it will continue to}} release downloadable content for Warriors of Rock through at least March and April 2011 with packs that were in the works prior to the closure of Guitar Hero.|$|E
500|$|The {{pastoral}} interlude {{that follows}} {{begins with the}} short instrumental movement, the Pifa, which {{takes its name from}} the shepherd-bagpipers, or pifferari, who played their pipes in the streets of Rome at Christmas time. Handel wrote the movement in both 11-bar and extended 32-bar forms; according to Burrows, either <b>will</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> performance. The group of four short recitatives which follow it introduce the soprano soloist—although often the earlier aria [...] "But who may abide" [...] is sung by the soprano in its transposed G minor form. The final [...] recitative of this section is in D major and heralds the affirmative chorus [...] "Glory to God". The remainder of Part I is largely carried by the soprano in B flat, in what Burrows terms a rare instance of tonal stability. The aria [...] "He shall feed his flock" [...] underwent several transformations by Handel, appearing at different times as a recitative, an alto aria and a duet for alto and soprano before the original soprano version was restored in 1754. [...] The appropriateness of the Italian source material for the setting of the solemn concluding chorus [...] "His yoke is easy" [...] has been questioned by the music scholar Sedley Taylor, who calls it [...] "a piece of word-painting... grieviously out of place", though he concedes that the four-part choral conclusion is a stroke of genius that combines beauty with dignity.|$|E
