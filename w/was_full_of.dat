5|$|After Manzikert, {{a partial}} {{recovery}} {{was made possible}} due {{to the efforts of}} the Komnenian dynasty. This is sometimes referred to as the Komnenian restoration. The first emperor of this royal line was Alexios I Komnenos (whose life and policies would be described by his daughter Anna Komnene in the Alexiad). Alexios's long reign of nearly 37 years <b>was</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> struggle. At his accession in 1081, the Byzantine Empire was in chaos after a prolonged period of civil war resulting from the defeat at Manzikert.|$|E
5|$|Another {{characteristic}} {{attributed to}} the ala is extreme voracity; in the Leskovac region, she was imagined as a monster with a huge mouth and a wooden spoon in her hand, with which she grabbed and devoured whatever came her way.

5|$|From 28 December 1945 to 4 January 1946, seven Wehrmacht {{servicemen}} {{were tried}} by a Soviet military court in Leningrad. One of them, Arno Düre, who {{was charged with}} murdering numerous civilians using machine-guns in Soviet villages, confessed to having taken part in burial (though not the execution) of 15,000 to 20,000 Polish POWs in Katyn. For this he was spared execution and was given 15 years of hard labor. His confession <b>was</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> absurdities, and thus he was not used as a Soviet prosecution witness during the Nuremberg trials. He later recanted his confession, claiming that {{he was forced to}} confess by the investigators.|$|E
5|$|Head I, {{completed}} late in 1948, {{is considered}} {{more successful than}} Head II. Although it is well-regarded critically, Head II is seen {{as something of a}} creative cul-de-sac, while Heads III, IV and V are usually considered as merely intermediate steps towards HeadVI. It is exceptional in Bacon's oeuvre that works of their relative poor quality survive; he was ruthlessly self-critical and often slashed or abandoned canvasses before they were completed. When pressed again by Brausen in 1953 to produce works for a New York show that she had been publicising for a year, he <b>was</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> doubt and destroyed most of what he had been working on, including several other popes.|$|E

The first publication of a Bible translation from Greek to a modern Balkanic language, it ran to 2,000copies, a huge number for the time. It preceded the modern Bulgarian version by two years and the Romanian translation by twenty.

5|$|Nazi {{occupation}} {{ended on}} 30 August 1944 and Liberation slowly healed the town's wounds. It {{had been a}} catastrophe for the network: of the 76 trams in circulation in 1939, 24 had been destroyed and 25 damaged; track and overhead lines had been mutilated; the Trianon depot had been bombed several times Still, service was slowly restored, thanks to the staff's hard work and above all passengers' help in shunting trailing cars. In 1945, 38 locomotives and 14 trailing cars were operational, but, despite restoration of service across the Seine on 20 April 1946, the war had struck a fatal blow. Rouen <b>was</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> out-of-date equipment and so trams were progressively replaced by buses and trolleybuses.|$|E
5|$|Wallace visits Menado on the {{northeast}} coast of Celebes. The people of the Minahasa region are fair-skinned, unlike {{anywhere else in the}} archipelago.

He finds that the people, under the guidance of missionaries, are the most hard-working, peaceful and civilised of the whole archipelago.

5|$|In 1907 Sir Walter Jenner of the Jenner baronets {{and son of}} {{the late}} Sir William Jenner, {{physician}} to Queen Victoria, bought Lytes Cary. At that time the Great Hall was {{being used as a}} cider store and the Great Parlour <b>was</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> farm equipment. Jenner's brother Leopold had just bought and started to restore Avebury Manor in Wiltshire, and Jenner was inspired by his brother's work there. He set about restoring Lytes Cary and decorating the interiors in period style, including fine 17th century and 18th century oak furniture, antique tapestries and fabrics modelled after medieval textiles. He had the west range rebuilt in a plain William and Mary style by the architect C.E. Ponting, but left the historic core of the house mostly untouched. It incorporates carvings believed to be from the demolished St Benet Gracechurch.|$|E

Like many of her experiences, the interview was to be incorporated into a future work; others included her impromptu baptism of Reggie with cold tea because she feared being separated from him after death, and Reggie's production of a Shakespeare play, in which she was promised a prime role that was given to another.|$|E
5|$|On 10 June 1166, Becket excommunicated {{a number}} of his opponents, some {{specifically}} by name, as well as any who opposed his cause. Henry's response was to order the English bishops to appeal to the pope, which they did at a council that Foliot organised and led in London on 24 June. The appeal was written by Foliot, and a separate letter from the bishops, also written by Foliot, was sent to the archbishop. The bishops rested their case on the fact that those excommunicated had not been warned or allowed to defend themselves. They pointed out to the pope that the king had not escalated the conflict and had behaved reasonably to the last papal overtures in the summer of 1165. Becket replied to these moves with a letter written to Foliot that <b>was</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> resentment and reproaches. Foliot's reply, in a letter that is usually titled Multiplicem nobis, set forth his view of Becket's abilities as archbishop as well as giving reasons why Becket was wrong. He then suggested that the archbishop compromise and exercise some humility in order to reach his goals. By the end of 1166, Foliot managed to resign his custody of the confiscated Canterbury benefices, something he had been attempting to do for some time, thus removing one source of conflict between him and Becket.|$|E

The hotel at Miami Locks (today known as Lake Harbor) was the sole {{structure}} to survive the storm. The bodies of many dead animals were resting on the canal banks. Ninety-nine people died in that town. In Chosen, only two people managed to escape a house that sheltered nineteen people.

5|$|The {{first act}} {{in this new}} war was Philip's seizure of 230 grain ships that had been waiting {{on the far side}} of the Bosphorus to be convoyed past Byzantion by Chares. He used the grain for his own {{supplies}} and the ships' timbers to build siege engines. However, what happened over the next few months is unclear; although to judge by Philip's activities in 339 BC, he cannot have spent more than three months besieging Byzantion. The walls of Byzantion were very tall and strong, and the city <b>was</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> defenders, and well supplied by sea; it is therefore possible Philip gave up on the siege, rather than waste time and men trying to assault it. The Greeks viewed this, and the abandonment of the siege of Perinthos, as a glorious victory. Philip's motives are as unclear as ever; Cawkwell suggests that, since he was now at war with Athens, he decided to go straight to the root of the problem, rather than be detained at Byzantion.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortunes}} of the LSA had begun to decline by 1920 when Boyce hired the first professional editor for Lone Scout, George N. Madison. Madison discovered that the LSA's membership roster was wildly inaccurate: it <b>was</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> duplications and inactive members. The reported 490,000 Lone Scouts in 1922 was a vastly inflated number. Boyce finally accepted West's annual offer to merge with the BSA in April 1924, with the merger formalized on June 16, 1924. Some Lone Scouts did not transfer to the BSA, but the BSA continued Lone Scouting as a separate division for another decade, gradually losing its unique programs. Present day Lone Scouts use the standard Cub Scouting and Boy Scouting programs and activities, but {{are not part of}} a pack or troop on a regular basis because of factors such as distance, weather, time, disability or other difficulties.|$|E
