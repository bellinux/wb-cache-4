500|$|Released on July 20, 1981, {{the album}} was not commercially acclaimed, failing to spawn a single hit. Though Sire Records had merged with Warner Bros. Records, none of the singles from Pleasant Dreams [...] were {{released}} in the US. Sire had insisted that the album be produced by a celebrity producer, hiring Graham Gouldman to the job expecting this to help expand the band's fan-base. Joey relates: [...] "The record company told us the album would bomb if we didn't use Graham Gouldman, so <b>we</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> Graham--and the album bombed anyway." [...] The album would only chart in the US and Sweden, peaking at fifty-eight on the Billboard 200 and thirty-five on the Sverigetopplistan chart—the singles released from the album failed to chart.|$|E
500|$|Of {{the twelve}} songs on Through the Windowpane, nine {{were written by}} lead singer Fyfe Dangerfield. Speaking in 2008, Guillemots member MC Lord Magrão remarked: [...] "For the first album, Fyfe handled most of the songs.... <b>We</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> him and {{developed}} [...]" [...] In October 2006, Guillemots brought out Of the Night, a four-track EP that featured one song written by {{each member of the}} band. Eighteen months later, the band released their second album, Red. This album's songs were more pop-orientated than their debut's, and were written by all four members of the group. Magrão explained: [...] "With the second , we ended up improvising loads and getting all the new songs from all of the improvised sessions we had." [...] Of the eleven tracks on the record, nine were credited to Guillemots, with the remaining two being credited to Dangerfield alone. Red songs received less critical acclaim than their debut's; Metacritic awarded the album a score of 60 out of 100, suggesting [...] "mixed or average reviews". Four tracks—"Get Over It", [...] "Falling Out of Reach" [...] and a double A-side of [...] "Kriss Kross" [...] and [...] "Clarion"—were released as singles in the UK.|$|E

500|$|In {{the season}} ten premiere, the {{audience}} got its {{first glimpse of}} the traditional Superman costume, which was left for Clark by Martha in the season nine finale. Although the suit was briefly seen through a reflection in Clark's eyes in the season nine finale, the suit that appeared in the season ten premiere was a different design. The producers, working alongside Warner Bros. and DC Comics, procured the costume worn by Brandon Routh in Superman Returns, which the team chose over the Christopher Reeve suit of the 1980s. DC Comics offered the suit worn by Reeve, but Peterson explained that it [...] "... just didn't quite fit with our world." [...] According to producer Kelly Souders, [...] "Well, the process was really a group effort. <b>We</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> DC, and we have Alicia Louis, who does a lot of stuff for us at the studio, and who was really instrumental. It took quite a bit to get that costume. There's a lot of sign-offs, it really was Warner Bros. and DC and us working to make it happen." [...] Peterson stated that the costume plays a more prominent role in the final season, with the last scene of Smallville ending with Clark wearing it. Before then, Clark began wearing a new costume in the season ten episode [...] "Shield". Here, Clark replaced the black trenchoat with a red leather jacket, and the [...] "S" [...] shield now embossed onto the chest of that jacket.|$|E
500|$|My Bloody Valentine were {{scheduled}} to record at Blackwing Studios in Southwark, London {{for the month of}} February 1989, and intended to use the time to conceptualise a new, more studio-based sound for their second album. Shields said that Creation first believed the album could be recorded [...] "in five days". According to Shields [...] "when it became clear that wasn't going to happen, they [...] freaked." [...] After several unproductive months, the band relocated in September to the basement studio The Elephant and Wapping, where they spent eight unproductive weeks. In-house engineer Nick Robbins said Shields made it clear from the outset that he (Robbins) [...] "was just there to press the buttons." [...] Robbins was quickly replaced by Harold Burgon, but according to Shields, Burgon's main contribution was to show the group how to use the in-studio computer. Burgon and Shields spent three weeks at the Woodcray studio in Berkshire working on the Glider EP, which Shields and Creation owner Alan McGee agreed would be released in advance of the album. Alan Moulder was hired to mix the Glider song [...] "Soon" [...] at Trident 2 studio in Victoria (the song would reappear as the closing track on Loveless). Shields said of Moulder, [...] "As soon as <b>we</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> him we realized we'd love to some more!" [...] When the group returned to work on the album Moulder was the sole engineer Shields trusted enough to perform tasks such as miking the amplifiers; all the other credited engineers were told [...] "We're so on top of this you don't even have to come to work." [...] Shields has since stated that [...] "these engineers—with the exception of Alan Moulder and later Anjali Dutt—were all just the people who came with the studio...everything we wanted to do was wrong, according to them", although the band did give credit on the album sleeve to anyone who was present during the recordings, [...] "even if all they did was fix tea", according to Shields.|$|E
500|$|Rainie's {{relationship}} with Phil Mitchell (McFadden) was first explored during her stint in 2010. Rainie and Phil {{were to be}} involved in a storyline involving the taking of crack cocaine. Discussing her return in 2010, she said she was pleased to be working closely with McFadden as they had not worked together. Franks explained that after being thrown out of the house by Tanya's ex-husband Max, and moving in with Phil that, [...] "it gets quite dark and dirty, really. Phil and Rainie are two people who meet at a point in their lives where they both see something equivalent in each other. He offers her something that she wants, and that is a place to be, while she has something that he wants, and that's drugs—so it's a match at that time." [...] Franks was given advice from the charity DrugScope on how to act the part and also undertook some of her own research, and she said she believed the scenes to be very realistic. She wanted the drugs storyline to help people, saying, [...] "If {{there are people who have}} a drugs problem, or an addiction problem of any kind really, they might watch something like this and it could trigger something in their mind that is relevant to them, or someone that they know. Hopefully it could make people think twice about carrying on with that, and perhaps look into getting some help. The organisation that <b>we</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with,</b> DrugScope, gives a lot of help and advice for people with drug addictions. I think it can be hugely helpful when a show as popular as EastEnders does something like this." [...] She also stated that if EastEnders [...] "has saved one life by putting this story out it's been worth it. The whole point of soaps is to reflect a certain amount of everyday life. Some of it is going to be light entertainment, some isn't." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{not officially}} confirmed, Ralf Hütter {{suggested}} that a second boxed set of their first three experimental albums—Kraftwerk, Kraftwerk 2 and Ralf and Florian—could be on its way, possibly seeing commercial release after their next studio album: [...] "We've just never really taken {{a look at those}} albums. They've always been available, but as really bad bootlegs. Now we have more artwork. Emil has researched extra contemporary drawings, graphics, and photographs to go with each album, collections of paintings that <b>we</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with,</b> and drawings that Florian and I did. We took a lot of Polaroids in those days." [...] Kraftwerk also released an iOS app called Kraftwerk Kling Klang Machine. The Lenbach House in Munich exhibited some Kraftwerk 3-D pieces in Autumn 2011. Kraftwerk performed three concerts to open the exhibit.|$|E
2500|$|On November 18, 2008, Blabbermouth.net {{announced}} Believer's {{signing with}} Cesspool Recordings, an imprint of Metal Blade Records owned by Howard Jones of Killswitch Engage. In {{an interview with}} Metalsucks.net, Bachman commented that the announcement about the band's re-activation had spread to the industry, and a staff member from Blabbermouth/Roadrunner Records suggested that they should contact Howard: [...] "We {{got in touch with}} him and it turns out he is a big Believer fan. He knows more about the history of Believer than we do! It was really cool. So we flew him in to the studio, <b>we</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> him over two days. Then he mentioned that he was starting this imprint with Brian Slagel from Metal Blade and he asked us if we wanted to be the first band on it." [...] Jones forwarded the band to Slagel whom reportedly replied: [...] "Believer? Absolutely, lets do this.'" [...] "It was sort of an easy process for us as far as the business end of it was concerned," [...] Bachman stated. They signed a 3-album deal with Metal Blade.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{one week}} before {{recording}} was due to start, a dearth of material became apparent: [...] "I had four songs written, because {{that was all the}} lyrics I had from Graham. And I realized I wasn't getting any more words out of him. So I had to write a song a day so there was enough. Graham came with a couple of things, {{but there was no way}} he would come with enough songs to fill out the rest of the record. So I took an instant editorial decision that was what was going to happen. Some of those words stayed, and some of those words got worked on by Graham and me. That was it, basically." [...] The band worked on more than a dozen songs, dropping those that were not [...] "working quite well enough". Many of the songs were recorded in a single take, the band playing as a threesome: [...] "You have to understand, as a three-piece, we'd very rarely played together. [...] So [...] I thought, 'Let's see how it goes in the studio.' <b>We</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> an engineer that we'd never worked with before, who was Irish. We did 'Moreover,' and after we were done playing, he came in and said, 'You make a big fookin' noise for three.'" [...] The band felt vindicated.|$|E

2500|$|The Smith {{family also}} practiced {{a form of}} folk magic, which, {{although}} not uncommon in this time and place, was criticized by many contemporary Protestants [...] "as either fraudulent illusion or {{the workings of the}} Devil." [...] Both Joseph Smith, Sr. and at least two of his sons worked at [...] "money digging," [...] using seer stones in mostly unsuccessful attempts to locate lost items and buried treasure. In a draft of her memoirs, Lucy Mack Smith referred to folk magic:I shall change my theme for the present, but let not my reader suppose that because I shall pursue another topic for a season that we stopt our labor and went at trying to win the faculty of Abrac, drawing magic circles or soothsaying, to the neglect of all kinds of business. We never during our lives suffered one important interest to swallow up every other obligation. But whilst <b>we</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> our hands, we endeavored to remember the service of and the welfare of our souls. D. Michael Quinn has written that Lucy Mack Smith viewed these magical practices as [...] "part of her family's religious quest" [...] while denying that they prevented [...] "family members from accomplishing other, equally important work." [...] Quinn also notes that the Smith family [...] "participated {{in a wide range of}} magic practices, and Smith's first vision occurred within the context of his family's treasure quest." [...] Jan Shipps notes that while Smith's [...] "religious claims were rejected by many of the persons who had known him in the 1820s because they remembered him as a practitioner of the magic arts," [...] others of his earliest followers were attracted to his claims [...] "for precisely the same reason." ...|$|E
