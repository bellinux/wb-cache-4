When standing shoulder to shoulder these pieces protect each other's blind spots, making the defense hold up against a lone Lion. An even stronger castle results from leaving the Golds diagonally protecting the outer-most pieces of the wall, although this has the obvious disadvantage that these Golds then cannot be used for attacking, or protecting the wings of your camp from infestation by enemy promoting pieces.

A 2007 article by Bruce Bawer published in City Journal magazine and a subsequent article in February 2009 by Barbara Kay in the National Post criticised some of Galtung's statements. Both authors criticized Galtung's opinion that while Communist China was [...] "repressive in a certain liberal sense", Mao Zedong was [...] "endlessly liberating when seen from many other perspectives that liberal theory has never understood" [...] because China showed that [...] "the whole theory about what an 'open society' is must be rewritten, probably also the theory of 'democracy'—and it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time before the West will be willing to view China as a master teacher in such subjects."

During the March 2011 nuclear accident the No. 2 reactor is believed to have released the largest amount of radioactive substances.
