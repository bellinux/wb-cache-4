60|$|In regions {{richer than}} the Upper Gambia the {{disappearance}} of man is ever followed by a springing of bush and forest so portentous that a few hands are helpless and hopeless. Such {{is the case with}} the great <b>wooded</b> <b>belt</b> north of the Gold Coast, where even the second-growth becomes impenetrable without the matchet, and where the swamps and muds, bred and fed by torrential rains, bar the transit of travellers. The Whydah and Gaboon countries are notable specimens of once populous regions now all but deserted.|$|E
60|$|Sometimes he {{grew tired}} of the prairies and then he and Tannis paddled {{themselves}} over the river in Nitchie Joe's dug-out, and landed on the old trail that struck straight into the <b>wooded</b> <b>belt</b> of the Saskatchewan valley, leading north to trading posts on the frontier of civilization. There they rambled under huge pines, hoary with the age of centuries, and Carey talked to Tannis about England and quoted poetry to her. Tannis liked poetry; she had studied it at school, and understood it fairly well. But once she told Carey that she thought it a long, round-about way of saying what you could say just as well in about a dozen plain words. Carey laughed. He liked to evoke those little speeches of hers. They sounded very clever, dropping from such arched, ripely-tinted lips.|$|E

Among the {{landmarks}} are the <b>wooded</b> <b>belt</b> on Botany Bay Island, {{location of}} the first contraband camps, which can be seen south of the river. The village of Rockville, location of a Confederate camp, is across the river on Wadmalaw Island ...|$|E
50|$|The {{martial eagle}} (Polemaetus bellicosus) {{is a large}} eagle native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is {{the only member of}} the genus Polemaetus. A species of the booted eagle {{sub-family}} (Aquillinae), it has feathering over its tarsus. One of the largest and most powerful species of booted eagle, it is a fairly opportunistic predator that varies it prey selection between mammals, birds and reptiles. Its hunting technique is unique as it is one of few eagle species known to hunt primarily from a high soar, by stooping on its quarry. An inhabitant of <b>wooded</b> <b>belts</b> of otherwise open savanna, this species has shown a precipitous drop in the last few centuries due to a variety of factors. The martial eagle is one of the most persecuted bird species in the world. Due to its habit of taking livestock and regionally valuable game, local farmers and game wardens frequently seek to eliminate martial eagles, although the effect of eagles on this prey is almost certainly considerably exaggerated. Currently, the martial eagle is classified with the status of Vulnerable to extinction by the IUCN.|$|R
5000|$|The Western Ukrainian {{agricultural}} settlers {{brought with}} them a style of folk architecture dominated by buildings made of unprocessed logs, which were much better suited to the <b>wooded</b> parkland <b>belt</b> rather than the [...] "bald prairie". The first house built - usually a burdei - used some sod; but was not exactly a sod hut, more like a dugout. The second house was often a white-washed and plastered log cabin usually with thatched roof, {{very similar to those}} seen in Ukraine. Barns, chicken coops, granaries, and so on were all built using the same techniques as the houses. By the 1930s most Ukrainian Canadians adopted the building styles of the North American mainstream including framed homes and barns built from commercial plans and using milled lumber.|$|R
5000|$|The {{botanical garden}} is {{centrally}} {{located on the}} site of the old cemetery and features old tree specimens and thematic gardens. The site for burials was transferred in 1904 to a new site on the Weser north of the town centre. The [...] "Glacis" [...] stems from the Fortress Minden. The present <b>wooded</b> parklike green <b>belt</b> was started after the demolition of the fortress walls. The post Napoleonic fortifications had replaced older walls stemming from the Middle Ages.|$|R
50|$|Dumble is a dialect word mainly (but not exclusively) {{confined}} {{to the north and}} east Midlands both as a place-name element and as a lexical item. It seems to contain the Old English dumbel or dymbel, 'hollow; wooded valley; deep cut water course'. The English Dialect Dictionary finds the word in Cheshire, Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Warwickshire (where 'doomble' is also found) and in Shropshire, with the meaning of a <b>wooded</b> valley, a <b>belt</b> of trees along the bed of a small stream; a ravine through which a watercourse runs; sometimes the word appears in the plural.|$|R
