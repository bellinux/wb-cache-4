She wrote to a friend, Charlotte Murchison, in November of that year: [...] "Perhaps you will laugh <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{the death of my}} old faithful dog has quite upset me, the cliff that fell upon him and killed him in a moment before my eyes, and close to my feet ... it was but a moment between me and the same fate." ...|$|E
500|$|England's next match pitted {{them against}} the United States—an {{opponent}} {{they were expected to}} easily overcome—at the Estádio Independência in Belo Horizonte, [...] inland. The selectors again picked Ramsey, but left star winger Stanley Matthews out on the grounds that England could beat the Americans without him, ignoring Winterbottom's protests. England dominated the first half. [...] "I'm not making excuses <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> in the first 45 minutes we had a year's bad luck," [...] Ramsey wrote in 1952. [...] "Shots which appeared certain to score missed by the width of a coat of paint. The American goalkeeper, much to his astonishment, found himself stopping the ball with his body, and on occasions his face, without really knowing what it was all about." [...] The US grabbed a shock lead on 37 minutes when a long shot towards England's penalty area flew into the net off the head of American forward Joe Gaetjens.|$|E

2500|$|Wilson made a {{plea for}} postwar world peace in May 1916; his speech recited the right of every nation to its sovereignty, {{territorial}} integrity and freedom from aggression. [...] "So sincerely do we believe these things", Wilson said, [...] "that I am sure that I speak the mind and wish {{of the people of}} America <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the United States is willing to become a partner in any feasible association of nations formed in order to realize these objectives". At home the speech was seen as a turning point in policy. In Europe the words were received by the British and the French without comment. His harshest European critics rightly thought the speech reflected indifference on Wilson's part; indeed, Wilson never wavered from a belief that the war was the result of corrupt European power politics.|$|E
2500|$|Adolf Hitler was {{appointed}} Chancellor on 30 January 1933 {{and sought to}} gain international respectability and to remove internal opposition by representatives of the Church and the Catholic Centre Party. He sent his vice chancellor Franz von Papen, a Catholic nobleman {{and member of the}} Centre Party, to Rome to offer negotiations about a Reichskonkordat. On behalf of Pacelli, Prelate Ludwig Kaas, the outgoing chairman of the Centre Party, negotiated first drafts of the terms with Papen. The concordat was finally signed, by Pacelli for the Vatican and von Papen for Germany, on 20 July and ratified on 10 September 1933. Father Franziscus Stratman, senior Catholic chaplain at Berlin University wrote [...] "The souls of well-disposed people are in a turmoil {{as a result of the}} tyranny of the National Socialists, and I am merely stating a fact <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the authority of the bishops among innumerable Catholics and non-Catholics has been shaken by the quasi-approval of the National Socialist movement". Bishop Preysing cautioned against compromise with the new regime, against those who saw the Nazi persecution of the church as an aberration that Hitler would correct.|$|E
