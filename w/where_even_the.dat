25|$|In 1904, Savage split {{company with}} McHenry, {{who had been}} Dan Patch's trainer and driver since 1901. A variety of reasons were cited, {{including}} McHenry's drinking and his complaints that Savage was treating Dan Patch like a circus act. Savage replaced McHenry with Harry Hersey, {{who had been the}} manager of Savage's farm in Minnesota but had little race-driving experience. Savage had no inclination to test Dan Patch in competitive formats, <b>where</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> fastest horse can lose due to a variety of factors. Instead, Savage used Dan Patch to promote the horse feed supplements his company produced and, in the model of Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West Show, turned each appearance by Dan Patch into a major event. Dan Patch was shipped in a custom built rail-car, with half of the space reserved for Dan Patch and the other half for his grooms and the horses used as prompters. Savage estimated that Dan Patch traveled roughly 10,000 miles in 1904 alone.|$|E

Rodriguez writes: [...] "To be sure, Extra Texture boasted several fine cuts... but the remainder of the collection was almost entirely weary in tone, amounting to a prolonged buzz kill." [...] Nick DeRiso, co-founder of the music website Something Else!, includes it on his list of the five worst solo albums by either John Lennon, McCartney or Harrison, and describes it as a [...] "grinding, relentlessly downbeat album, <b>where</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> name Extra Texture has come to feel like a cruel joke".|$|E
500|$|The {{influence}} of Paris permeates La Comédie: nature defers to the artificial metropolis, {{in contrast to}} descriptions of the weather and wildlife in the countryside. [...] "If in Paris", Rogers says, [...] "we are in a man-made region <b>where</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> seasons are forgotten, these provincial towns are nearly always pictured in their natural setting". Balzac said, [...] "the streets of Paris possess human qualities and we cannot shake off the impressions they make upon our minds." [...] His labyrinthine city provided a literary model used later by English novelist Charles Dickens and Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky. The centrality of Paris in La Comédie Humaine is key to Balzac's legacy as a realist. [...] "Realism {{is nothing if not}} urban", notes critic Peter Brooks; the scene of a young man coming into the city to find his fortune is ubiquitous in the realist novel, and appears repeatedly in Balzac's works, such as Illusions Perdues.|$|E
500|$|The {{period of}} the British Raj hastened the Marwari's downfall, as did the {{eventual}} independence of India. The British occupiers preferred other breeds, and tried to eliminate the Marwari, along with the Kathiawari. The British instead preferred Thoroughbreds and polo ponies, and reduced {{the reputation of the}} Marwari to the point <b>where</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> inward-turning ears of the breed were mocked as the [...] "mark of a native horse". During the 1930s the Marwari deteriorated, with breeding stock diminishing and becoming of poorer quality due to poor breeding practices. Indian independence, along with the obsolescence of warriors on horseback, led to a decreased need for the Marwari and many animals were subsequently killed. In the 1950s many Indian noblemen lost their land and hence much of their ability to take care of animals, resulting in many Marwari horses being sold as pack horses, castrated, or killed. The breed {{was on the verge of}} extinction until the intervention of Maharaja Umaid Singhji in the first half of the 20th century saved the Marwari. His work was carried on by his grandson, Maharaja Gaj SinghII.|$|E

500|$|Martin {{deliberately}} {{ignored the}} writing rule of never giving two characters names {{starting with the}} same letter. Instead, character names reflect the naming systems in various European family histories, where particular names were associated with specific royal houses and <b>where</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> secondary families assigned the same names repeatedly. The Ice and Fire story therefore has children called [...] "Robert" [...] in honor of King Robert of House Baratheon, a [...] "Brandon" [...] in every other generation of the Starks in commemoration of Brandon the Builder (of the Wall), and the syllable [...] "Ty" [...] commonly occurring in given names of House Lannister. Confident that readers would pay attention, Martin distinguished people sharing a given name by adding numbers or locations to their given names (e.g. Henry V of England). The family names were designed in association with ethnic groups (see backstory): the First Men in the North of Westeros had very simply descriptive names like Stark and Strong, whereas {{the descendants of the}} Andal invaders in the South have more elaborate, undescriptive house names like Lannister or Arryn, and the Targaryens and Valyrians from the Eastern continent have the most exotic names with the letter Y.|$|E
500|$|The second season's mythology was {{intended}} to be revealed in small parcels. Throughout the season, Pinkner and Wyman tried to create an episode that best bridged [...] "standalone" [...] traits—needed for casual viewers—with the further advancement of the show's mythology for those who watched regularly. At {{the start of the season}} Pinkner believed they had found a [...] "good rhythm" [...] between the two, as the mythology [...] "really [...] affect the characters, to the point <b>where</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> standalone [...] advance mythology". After the season ended, Wyman commented at San Diego Comic-Con International, [...] "We learned that the fan fans love mythology but there are needs from the networks. We started experimenting with a thing we called 'mythalones', not standalone or myth." [...] Wyman cited the season's 18th episode, [...] "White Tulip" [...] as a prime example, noting [...] "You can see that you're following Walter's journey, it's the right mix." [...] The Fringe producers strove to avoid becoming bogged down in mythology, an issue that they perceived happened in Alias, another J.J. Abrams television series. In a joint statement released midway through the season, Abrams, Pinkner, and Wyman noted that their [...] "only internal rule is that we make every effort to not raise mythological questions merely to string viewers along, but rather to provide answers that generate consequences." ...|$|E
500|$|The song has {{received}} almost universally negative reviews from music critics, for its songwriting, instrumentation, Black's singing voice, and the video choreography. Lyndsey Parker of Yahoo! Music {{asked if it}} could be [...] "the worst song ever." [...] On March 29, 2011, it surpassed Justin Bieber's [...] "Baby" [...] as the most disliked YouTube video, with 1.17 million dislikes, and once had over 3 million [...] "dislikes", accounting for 88% of the total ratings of the video. The video was later removed, although it has since been officially re-uploaded. The co-writer and producer of [...] "Friday", Clarence Jey, said about the song that [...] "the concept we feel seems to have crossed a lot of boundaries, for the better or worse." [...] Observers have called it [...] "bizarre," [...] "inept," [...] and [...] "hilariously dreadful." [...] The song and Black herself were [...] "savaged" [...] on social networks across the Internet, while being seen as a [...] "YouTube laughing stock." [...] On YouTube, the video was met with negative comments and video responses, including comments interpreted as [...] "violent". Kevin Rutherford, a columnist for Billboard magazine, wrote, [...] "Black's video for 'Friday' is one of those rare occurrences <b>where</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> most seasoned critics of Internet culture don't know where to begin. From the singing straight out of Auto-Tuned hell to lyrics such as 'Tomorrow is Saturday / And Sunday comes afterwards / I don't want this weekend to end' and a hilariously bad rap about passing school buses, 'Friday' is something that simply must be seen and heard to be fully appreciated." [...] Many other reviewers also singled out the lyrics in particular for criticism, which were described as [...] "overly simple and repetitive" [...] by TNT Magazine. Jim Edwards of BNET and Doug Gross of CNN both noted that the rap break from the considerably older rapper was [...] "creepy."

[...] Blake is emphasizing, she thinks, [...] "that aspiration itself (if it is present-hating and future-loving) is a form of confinement".

2500|$|Combinatorial auction is any auction for the {{simultaneous}} sale {{of more than}} one item where bidders can place bids on an [...] "all-or-nothing" [...] basis on [...] "packages" [...] rather than just individual items.

In combinatorial auctions, determining the winning bidder(s) can be a complex process <b>where</b> <b>even</b> <b>the</b> bidder with the highest individual bid is not guaranteed to win. For example, in an auction with four items (W, X, Y and Z), if Bidder A offers $50 for items W & Y, Bidder B offers $30 for items W & X, Bidder C offers $5 for items X & Z and Bidder D offers $30 for items Y & Z, the winners will be Bidders B & D while Bidder A misses out because the combined bids of Bidders B & D is higher ($60) than for Bidders A and C ($55).|$|E

2500|$|Explanations other than, or emphasizing, the prosecution's lack of {{forensic}} evidence were {{given for the}} jury's decision.

The CSI effect was also extensively argued—that society now lives [...] "in a 'CSI age' where everyone expects fingerprints and DNA, and we are sending a message that old-fashioned circumstantial evidence is not sufficient". Likewise, commentators such as O. J. Simpson case prosecutor Marcia Clark believe that the jury interpreted [...] "reasonable doubt" [...] too narrowly.

2500|$|Much {{criticism}} of the novel noted its length.

Contrarily, the Star Tribune felt [...] "the satiric early half is Ellis in peak form, the thriller-style second half is less successful."
