One SEAL sniper fired two shots at al-Kuwaiti and the other fired two three-round bursts. Two of the snipers' bullets went through al-Kuwaiti and killed his wife who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> him. The Razor 2 team cleared the guest house and then breached their way into the main house with explosives. As the Razor 2 team entered the main house, al-Qaeda courier Arshad Khan pointed his AK-47 gun and was killed with two shots. The SEAL team fired a total of 16 shots, killing Osama bin Laden, Khalid bin Laden, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti and al-Kuwaiti's wife, Arshad Khan, and wounding Osama bin Laden's wife Amal al-Sadah.|$|E

The final provocation was when Fiala moved into Gravano's private office and began breaking through an office wall. Gravano, enraged, stormed {{into the office}} followed by Garafola. Fiala <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> Gravano's desk. He sat down in Gravano's chair, smirking at the two men.|$|E

The driver and his commanders were interrogated extensively {{over a long period of}} time with the use of polygraph tests and video evidence. They had no knowledge that she was standing in the path of the tractor. An autopsy of Corrie's body revealed that the cause of death was from falling debris and not from the tractor physically rolling over her. It was a tragic accident that never should have happened.|$|E

25|$|The next psychic {{claimed to}} be able to read auras around people. He claimed that auras were visible at least five inches above each of them. He {{selected}} ten people who he said had clearly visible auras. They were to stand behind screens and he claimed that their auras would be visible above the screens, which were numbered 1 through 10, and the subjects were told by the astrologer behind which screen to stand. He was to tell whether or not a person <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> each screen, by seeing their aura above. Since random guessing would be expected to get about five correct, the psychic needed to get eight of the ten right. The psychic stated that he saw an aura over all ten screens, but people were behind only four of the screens.|$|E

Knowing he will not receive any funds, Chellappa decides to scare Viswanathan and narrates a horror story. Nagesh later said this was Gopu's idea; [...] "You know how director Dada [...] tells a story. Just follow the pattern". Nagesh and Balaiah completed shooting the scene in a single take.

Shanmugham who, impressed with the narration, called Sridhar to listen to it. Kanchana recalled filming the scene and said, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>behind,</b> trembling to control my laughter.

500|$|O'Neill {{states that}} bin Laden <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> {{a woman with}} {{his hands on her}} shoulders, pushing her forward. O'Neill {{immediately}} shot bin Laden twice in the forehead, then once more as bin Laden crumpled to the floor. Matt Bissonnette, who entered the room at about the same time, also claims to have fired shots into bin Laden's fallen body. Simultaneously, in these versions, one of bin Laden's wives, Amal Ahmed Abdul Fatah is said to have screamed at the SEALs in Arabic and motioned as if she were about to charge. The lead SEAL shot her in the leg, then grabbed both women and shoved them aside. The weapon used to kill bin Laden was an HK416 allegedly using 5.56mm NATO 77-grain OTM (open-tip match) rounds made by Black Hills Ammunition. The SEAL team leader radioed, [...] "For God and country—Geronimo, Geronimo, Geronimo" [...] and then, after being prompted by McRaven for confirmation, [...] "Geronimo E.K.I.A."

500|$|In the video, {{the lyrics}} of [...] "Come Dancing" [...] are used as the storyline. Calling back to his youth, Ray starred as the [...] "spiv" [...] {{character}} who took the sister out to dance. Ray's character, according to author Johnny Rogan, {{was inspired by the}} Davies brothers' uncle, Frank Willmore, who Dave Davies described as [...] "an old school kind of cockney". The members of the Kinks were featured as the band performing at the palais {{at the end of the}} video, with the spiv character solemnly watching the performance. Temple said of this scene, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> [...] Scorcese at a bar, and he was going on about that shot, saying it was one of his favorites ever. There's a [...] Buñuel film, Simon of the Desert, where this guy who's been suffering on his pillar in the desert in BC whatever ends up in some weird club in Mexico City in '65. It's a bit like that. [...] did it beautifully, the fact he's so still and they're all heaving around him. I think Ray could have been more of an actor. He has a great, deep sense of film." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nicknamed [...] "Big Jake" [...] and [...] "Wrong-Grip Jake", Iverson's unique style caused Australian captain Lindsay Hassett, {{a fellow}} Victorian, {{to hide his}} action during {{training}} sessions for the national team. Hassett prohibited Iverson from bowling to New South Wales batsmen {{to prevent them from}} analysing his bowling action, making him more effective in Sheffield Shield matches for Victoria against New South Wales. This led to conflict with New South Wales batsmen. When Iverson was put on to bowl during the Tests, Hassett would remove Keith Miller, a New South Welshman, from his position at first slip and move him to mid on, so that he <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> Iverson and could not understand how Iverson's bowling action worked.|$|E

According to this account, singer-songwriter James Blunt was also at the party and joked that he would love a knighthood, at which point Beatrice jokingly said she could arrange it and fetched a ceremonial sword. Blunt got down on one knee while Beatrice held the sword above him and said 'arise Sir James', before she swung the sword over her shoulder unaware that Sheeran <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> her.

2500|$|The six conspirators {{lined the}} route. They were spaced {{out along the}} Appel Quay, each one with {{instructions}} to try to kill Franz Ferdinand when the royal car reached his position. The first conspirator on the route to see the royal car was Muhamed Mehmedbašić. Standing by the Austro-Hungarian Bank, Mehmedbašić lost his nerve and allowed the car to pass without taking action. Mehmedbašić later said that a policeman <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> him and feared he would be arrested before {{he had a chance}} to throw his bomb. At 10:15, when the six-car procession passed the central police station, nineteen-year-old student Nedeljko Čabrinović hurled a hand grenade at the Archduke's car. The driver accelerated when he saw the object flying towards him, but the bomb had a 10-second delay and exploded under the wheel of the fourth car. Two of the occupants, Eric von Merizzi and Count Alexander von Boos-Waldeck, were seriously wounded. About a dozen spectators were also hit by bomb shrapnel. After Čabrinović's bomb missed the car, five other conspirators, including Princip, lost an opportunity to attack because of the heavy crowds and the car's high speed. To avoid capture, Čabrinović swallowed a cyanide capsule and jumped into the Miljacka river to make sure he died. However, the cyanide pill was decayed and only made him sick, and the river was only [...] deep. He was soon hauled out and detained by police.|$|E

A Derek Grant goal in the first period for the Predators was overturned on review, despite such a play not being reviewable by NHL rules, after the NHL declared that game referee Ghislain Hebert, who <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> the net when the goal was scored, [...] "was in the process of blowing his whistle to stop play when Miller covered the puck with his blocker before the puck crossed the goal line." [...] Continuing their swing through Canada on January 19 in Calgary, the Predators jumped to a 4–0 lead – thanks to Ellis (two goals), Forsberg and Neal – {{at the beginning of the}} third period. Saros made 32 saves and held off a three-goal rally in the final four minutes of the game to beat the Flames 4–3. The next night in Edmonton, Ardvisson and Ellis scored for the Predators, while goals by Matt Hendricks and Milan Lucic of the Oilers sent the contest into overtime. Ellis and Neal scored in shootout to give the Predators a 3–2 victory over the Oilers. Back in the United States on January 22 to conclude their five-game road trip, the Predators scored four unanswered goals – thanks to Forsberg (two), Johansen and Neal – to overcome a two-goal deficit, defeat the Minnesota Wild 4–2 and give head coach Peter Laviolette his 500th career victory.|$|E
