5|$|The Temple {{teaches that}} the true self, or essence, is immortal, and Xeper {{is the ability to}} align {{consciousness}} with this essence. Aquino taught that there is an afterlife for those who have reached the necessary level of individual development. This afterlife could occur in the individual's subjective universe. Those unable to reach this level dissolve into non-existence when the physical body dies. Self-initiation is knowledge understood as a conjunction of intellect and intuition. In keeping <b>with</b> <b>its</b> <b>emphasis</b> on the individual, the Temple encourages their members to celebrate their own birthday, and does not prescribe any other calendar of religious festivities.|$|E
5|$|This Lime-Tree Bower and Frost at Midnight also {{deal with}} a similar {{understanding}} of nature, and the ideas within This Lime-Tree Bower {{form the basis for}} a natural education. Coleridge hoped that his son Hartley would be able to learn through nature in an innocent way. Unlike Wordsworth's nature, Coleridge's has a strong Christian presence and nature is a physical presence of God's word. There is also a connection between Dejection and Frost at Midnight <b>with</b> <b>its</b> <b>emphasis</b> on Coleridge's private life.|$|E
5|$|Italian neorealism of the 1940s, <b>with</b> <b>its</b> <b>emphasis</b> on quasi-documentary authenticity, was an {{acknowledged}} {{influence on}} trends {{that emerged in}} American noir. The Lost Weekend (1945), directed by Billy Wilder, another Vienna-born, Berlin-trained American auteur, {{tells the story of}} an alcoholic in a manner evocative of neorealism. It also exemplifies the problem of classification: one of the first American films to be described as a film noir, it has largely disappeared from considerations of the field. Director Jules Dassin of The Naked City (1948) pointed to the neorealists as inspiring his use of location photography with non-professional extras. This semidocumentary approach characterized a substantial number of noirs in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Along with neorealism, the style had an American precedent cited by Dassin, in director Henry Hathaway's The House on 92nd Street (1945), which demonstrated the parallel influence of the cinematic newsreel.|$|E

5|$|Wagner {{had been}} greatly {{impressed}} with his reading of Arthur Schopenhauer in 1854, and this deeply affected his thoughts and practice on music and art. Some writers (e.g. Bryan Magee) see Parsifal as Wagner's last great espousal of Schopenhauerian philosophy. Parsifal can heal Amfortas and redeem Kundry because he shows compassion, which Schopenhauer saw as the highest form of human morality. Moreover, he displays compassion {{in the face of}} sexual temptation (act 2, scene 3). Schopenhaurian philosophy also suggests that the only escape from the ever-present temptations of human life is through negation of the Will, and overcoming sexual temptation is in particular a strong form of negation of the Will. When viewed in this light, Parsifal, <b>with</b> <b>its</b> <b>emphasis</b> on Mitleid ("compassion") is a natural follow-on to Tristan und Isolde, where Schopenhauer's influence is perhaps more obvious, with its focus on Sehnen ("yearning"). Indeed, Wagner originally considered including Parsifal as a character in act 3 of Tristan, but later rejected the idea.|$|E

An argument is made that this curriculum approach <b>with</b> <b>its</b> <b>emphases</b> on authenticity, identity, agency and embodied learning addresses issues of the disjunct between access to knowledge, museums and cultural capital.

40|$|Qualitative {{psychology}} {{has been}} co-opted by institutions that represent scientific rationality inherited from modernity (<b>with</b> <b>its</b> <b>emphases</b> on observation, measurement, and control). A process of cooptation involves an assimilationist attitude of ownership, where the difference or opposition adheres to a policy preset by {{the largest group}} 2 ̆ 7 s consensus and privilege. Through the institutionalization of qualitative research and its bond, sometimes forced-to traditional scientific paradigms, qualitative psychology loses its critical potential. Given this, we propose a critical review of the epistemological and ontological assumptions of qualitative psychology and propose alternative methods (such as critical discourse analysis, feminist epistemology, fractal method, critical ethnography, among others) to revitalize critical activity...|$|R

25|$|Thackeray {{saw himself}} as writing in the {{realistic}} tradition, and distinguished his work from the exaggerations and sentimentality of Dickens. Some later commentators have accepted this self-evaluation and seen him as a realist, but others note his inclination to use eighteenth-century narrative techniques, such as digressions and direct addresses to the reader, and argue that through them he frequently disrupts the illusion of reality. The school of Henry James, <b>with</b> <b>its</b> <b>emphasis</b> on maintaining that illusion, marked a break with Thackeray's techniques.|$|E

The Inquisition had not kept the writings of Niccolò Machiavelli, Voltaire, Denis Diderot, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Paine, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, John Locke, and others out of Spanish America; their ideas were often discussed by criollos, especially those educated at the university in Chuquisaca.

However, it is argued here that some troubling issues need attention if the CT movement is to achieve the impact of its promise. Problematic silences in its discourse may lead to more parochial rather than more expansive teaching; structural gaps in its implementation threaten its sustainability; and a certain timidity in the Standard steers away from the most compelling issues for public education and teaching. This discussion suggests that we consider ways of encouraging teaching to be more bold, rude and risky.
