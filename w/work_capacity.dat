40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether employees with disabilities were initially assigned to jobs with work demands that matched their <b>work</b> <b>capacities.</b> Participants: Forty-six employees with various physical, mental, sensory and multiple disabilities {{working in a}} sheltered workshop. Methods: Physical and psychosocial <b>work</b> <b>capacities</b> were assessed post-offer and pre-placement using the Ergo-Kit and Melba. Work demands of the jobs were determined by workplace assessments with TRAC and Melba and were compared with the <b>work</b> <b>capacities.</b> Results: Of the 46 employees, 25 employees were not physically overloaded. When physical overload occurred, it was most often due to regular lifting. All employees were physically underloaded on six or more work activities, most often due to finger dexterity and manipulation. Almost all employees (n = 43) showed psychosocial overload or underload on one or more psychosocial characteristics. Psychosocial overload was most often due to endurance (long-term work performance), while psychosocial underload was most often due to speaking and writing. Conclusion: Despite the assessment of <b>work</b> <b>capacities</b> at job placement, underload and overload occurred on both physical activities and psychosocial characteristics. Assessing both <b>work</b> <b>capacities</b> and <b>work</b> demands before job placement is recommended. At job placement more attention should be paid to overloading due to lifting and long-term work performanc...|$|R

50|$|Hypoxia {{occurs when}} the {{bloodstream}} lacks oxygen. In an aerospace environment, this occurs because {{there is little or}} no oxygen. The <b>work</b> <b>capacity</b> of the body is reduced, decreasing the movement of all muscles (skeletal and cardiac muscles). The decrease in <b>work</b> <b>capacity</b> is related to the decrease of the oxygen of transportation velocity. Some acute effects from hypoxia include: dizziness, laxity, mental fatigue, muscle fatigue and euphoria. These effects will affect a non-acclimated person starting in an altitude of 3650 meters above sea level. These effects will increase and can result in cramps or convulsions at an altitude of 5500 meters and will end in an altitude at 7000 meters with a coma.|$|E

These capacities are used to develop the closure scheduling tool. The developed tool is computer-based which considers the excessive flows due to lane closure and determine the dissipation period affecting from the closure. The results show the summary of dissipation durations for different closure schedules. To demonstrate the real world application of this developed tool, a selected section of Highway No. 1 (Phaholyothin highway) was selected as a case study.
