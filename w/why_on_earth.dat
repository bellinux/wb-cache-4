It was the hardest video I`ve ever done so I kept thinking, <b>why</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> did I come up with this concept? People don’t realise but I definitely have that Australian tomboy side to me. I love snakes and sharks and jumping out of planes and stuff.

500|$|For the game's cover, Acclaim hired Italian male model Fabio Lanzoni to pose as Kuros; Fabio was {{presented}} {{on the cover}} bare-chested and without armor. When Zippo Games saw {{the image of the}} cover a week prior to its release, they were perplexed. According to Ste Pickford, [...] "Our jaws hit the floor when we first saw this image (which was, being merely the developers, probably about a week before the game's release). <b>Why</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> did they choose a photograph of a bare-chested barbarian to promote a game starring a knight in shining armour?". Pickford added that [...] "We used it {{as an example of the}} lack of imagination of Americans", while suggesting that having an actual suit or armor would be too costly to use for a photo shoot. Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II was released by Acclaim for the NES in North America in December1989 and in Europe and Australia in 1991. It managed to sell about 500,000 copies in North America and about 50,000 copies in Europe. Following the game's release, Zippo Games would proceed to develop its next game for Rare, they would eventually also release the third installment in the Wizards & Warriors series, [...]|$|E
500|$|Poppy's {{introduction}} to EastEnders in what Jody Thompson of the Daily Mail described as [...] "a bizarre and utterly irrelevant chat" [...] was criticised by Daniella Graham of the Metro, {{who said that}} [...] "viewers were left questioning <b>why</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> anyone thought this pointless sub-plot was necessary". In contrast, The Press and Journal Derek Lord deemed Poppy to have been [...] "a welcome addition to the show"; he wrote that, [...] "as a double act, [...] no Morecambe and Wise, {{but at least they}} bring an element of something approaching humour to the otherwise soul-destroying drabness of the London soap". Jim Shelley of the Daily Mirror labelled Poppy the [...] "Optimist of the week" [...] for her line [...] "I bet it's really nice here when they ain't having a funeral", and [...] "Delicate flower of the week" [...] for her [...] "That is so well tragic innit?" [...] when commenting on Tommy Moon's death. Stuart Heritage from guardian.co.uk said that Poppy made an impact in her two episodes, branding her as [...] "perhaps the greatest television bit-part character of the modern age". Heritage added that she had [...] "the name of a Bond girl, the hair of a Winkleman and the voice of a Katie Price robot running low on batteries"; describing her as [...] "electrifying", he hoped that she would return. Katy Moon from Inside Soap discussed Poppy's original two episode stint: ...|$|E

In China. [...] According to a 2006 interview with The Independent, Andy Stephens, manager of George Michael, said that the film [...] was simply not good enough to be shown in public: [...] "It's a dreadful film... It's 20 years old and it's rubbish. <b>Why</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> should we allow it to be shown?", although after viewing it in 2008 critic and journalist John Harris described it as [...] "a rich, poetic, panoramic portrait of China's strangeness to the eyes of outsiders".|$|E
2500|$|Both Johnny Marr and Morrissey have {{repeatedly}} {{said that they}} will not reunite the band. In 2006, Morrissey declared, [...] "I would rather eat my own testicles than reform the Smiths, and that's saying something for a vegetarian." [...] When asked why in another interview the same year, he responded, [...] "I feel as if I've worked very hard since the demise of the Smiths and the others haven't, so why hand them attention that they haven't earned? We are not friends, we don't see each other. <b>Why</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> would we be on a stage together?" [...] In a February 2009 interview on BBC Radio 2, he said, [...] "People always ask me about reunions and I can't imagine why... the past seems like a distant place, and I'm pleased with that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2016, in the Rolling Stone video series 'Her Sound, Her Story: Tina Arena', she {{discusses}} how {{the music}} industry squanders women as both they and their careers mature. [...] "You’ve got {{to give me a}} really damn good reason why somebody, who is in the prime of their career and are doing really good work, <b>why</b> <b>on</b> <b>earth</b> they should stop? Are you going to tell a male who {{is at the top of}} his game in whatever domain, that he needs to step down and retire?". Speaking to series creators Michelle Grace Hunder and Claudia Sangiorgi Dalimore, Arena goes on to talk about the importance of female solidarity, mentioning how competition between women can be (and has been) dismantled by supportive relationships and encouragement of other women. Arena says [...] "Get out of the ring. Take your boxing gloves off. Be convinced in the argument of your thoughts and your dreams".|$|E

"Indeed," [...] Captain Manley said {{surprised}}; [...] "I thought, of course, {{they were}} family pistols. <b>Why,</b> how <b>on</b> <b>earth,</b> {{if it is}} not an impertinent question, did you boys get hold of two brace of such pistols as these?

50|$|Larger {{planetary}} {{bodies in}} the early Solar System were hot enough to experience melting and differentiation, with heavier elements (like nickel) finding {{their way into the}} core. The lighter silicate rocks presumably float to the surface. Thus this might explain <b>why</b> iron <b>on</b> <b>Earth's</b> surface is depleted in nickel, while iron meteorites (from the center of a differentiated planetoid) are rich in nickel. Since it is not a very active rock-forming element, most of our nickel is in the Earth's core. A key feature of extraterrestrial materials, in comparison to naturally occurring terrestrial materials, is therefore Ni/Fe ratios above several percent.|$|R
