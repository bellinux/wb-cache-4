25|$|On 26 June 1964, American Ambassador to Laos Leonard Unger was {{ambivalent}} about Operation Triangle's chances of success, but felt {{the opportunity for}} victory too good to resist. The planning of the military operation may have been local; however, approval to proceed had {{to come from the}} White House, where President Lyndon Baines Johnson was monitoring the situation. In any case, it was planned that three Royal Lao Army columns would converge on the intersection of Routes 7 and 13 in Laos, trapping a Lao communist force. <b>With</b> <b>any</b> <b>luck,</b> the highly strategic Plain of Jars would be left exposed to Royal Lao Government occupation.|$|E
500|$|In France, satirical {{magazine}} Charlie Hebdo {{was taken}} to court for publishing the cartoons; it was acquitted of charges that it incited hatred. [...] In Canada a human rights commission investigated The Western Standard, a magazine which published the cartoons, but found insufficient grounds to proceed with a human rights tribunal (which does not imply criminal charges, but is a quasi-judicial, mandatory process) against the publication. These government investigations of journalists catalysed debate {{about the role of}} government in censoring or prosecuting expressions they deemed potentially hateful. Critics said the cartoon controversy was a sign that attempts at judicial codification of such concepts as respect, tolerance and offence have backfired on the West. Michael Neumann wrote, [...] "Western piety has left the West without a leg to stand on in this dispute. It is no good trumpeting rights of free expression, because these rights are now supposed to have nebulous but severe limitations." [...] Tim Cavanaugh wrote that the incident revealed the danger of hate speech laws, writing, [...] "The issue will almost certainly lead to a revisiting of the lamentable laws against 'hate speech' in Europe, and <b>with</b> <b>any</b> <b>luck</b> to a debate on whether these laws are more likely to destroy public harmony than encourage it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{critical}} {{response to}} Good Morning Revival has been mixed to negative, {{with a score}} of 45/100 points on review aggregator site Metacritic. The New York Times gave the album a negative review, calling it [...] "a mystifyingly inept CD that includes {{some of the worst}} lyrics you will — or, <b>with</b> <b>any</b> <b>luck,</b> won’t — hear all year." [...] The Guardian said [...] "Revival is a fourth album of stunning fatuousness." [...] Dr Dave De Sylvia of Sputnikmusic said [...] "Good Morning Revival is inconsistent; downright sinful at times, it contains sparks of brilliance and some very creditable pop moments." [...] Alternative Press said [...] "Good Charlotte have become caricatures of themselves". NOW Magazine said [...] "After years and years of hating every ounce of Maryland's mall-punk icons Good Charlotte, it seems now that the actual trick to enjoying their music on any plausible level is to go into the whole thing with absolutely no expectations. Not even low expectations. Nothing." [...] However, Billboard was positive of the album, calling it [...] "an album that proves being rich and famous doesn't always blunt a band's creative appetite." ...|$|E
40|$|Not {{every class}} {{can be a}} cakewalk. From three-hour labs to brutal exams, {{there are a number}} of factors that can take a class from an “easy A” to a {{nightmare}} in no time. But sometimes, the class matters less than who’s teaching it.

60|$|We hunted {{near the}} coast for a while, but were pot rewarded <b>with</b> <b>any</b> {{particular}} <b>luck.</b> Finally {{we decided to}} hide the canoe and strike inland in search of game. At Juag's suggestion we dug {{a hole in the}} sand at the upper edge of the beach and buried the craft, smoothing the surface over nicely and throwing aside the excess material we had excavated. Then we set out away from the sea. Traveling in Thuria is less arduous than under the midday sun which perpetually glares down on the rest of Pellucidar's surface; but it has its draw-backs, one of which is the depressing influence exerted by the everlasting shade of the Land of Awful Shadow.|$|R

Milverton is a heavy sleeper, and retires punctually at ten-thirty. <b>With</b> <b>any</b> <b>luck</b> we should be back here by two, with the Lady Eva's letters in my pocket." ...|$|E
60|$|They had a {{perfectly}} miserable time. Edgar Wallace {{seems to have}} lost his way almost at once. He was found two days later in an almost starving condition at Steeple Bumpstead. How he got there nobody knows. He said he had set out to walk to where {{the noise of the}} guns seemed to be, and had gone on walking. Bennett Burleigh, that crafty old campaigner, had the sagacity to go by Tube. This brought him to Hampstead, the scene, it turned out later, of the fiercest operations, and <b>with</b> <b>any</b> <b>luck</b> he might have had a story to tell. But the lift stuck half-way up, owing to a German shell bursting in its neighbourhood, and it was not till the following evening that a search-party heard and rescued him.|$|E

25|$|England and Australia {{drew the}} match. England were happy {{that they had}} saved the Test, but their batting was still weak with only Graveney, May and Cowdrey capable of playing Benaud's leg-spin <b>with</b> <b>any</b> confidence. Trueman had bowled well without <b>any</b> <b>luck</b> and Laker and Lock had shown their {{spinning}} skills, but the English fielding needed to be improved. Benaud was criticised for his defensive tactics, but {{said he had a}} job to do and 2–0 up was good for him and his team.|$|R

5000|$|IGN {{reviewer}} Jesse Schedeen {{gave the}} miniseries an 8.8 out of 10, saying [...] "The Night Manager proves that television {{is the ideal}} format to bring le Carré's novels to life. This miniseries is tightly paced, suspenseful and boasts strong performances {{from the likes of}} Hiddleston, Laurie, Colman and Hollander. <b>With</b> <b>any</b> <b>luck,</b> this series will open the doors for more of le Carré's classic spy tales to {{make their way to the}} small screen." ...|$|E
5000|$|Reception of {{the album}} was good with the critics. Matthew Chisling of Allmusic stated that Broken & Beautiful was a strong effort where [...] "...every single track {{individually}} is strong, and the best moments on the album are stronger than anything Kelly Clarkson ever recorded. <b>With</b> <b>any</b> <b>luck,</b> Broken and Beautiful will be a commercial success and McNeil will become the household name she deserves to be."

5000|$|Bobby Peacock of Roughstock {{also gave}} a {{generally}} positive review, saying that some {{songs such as}} [...] "Consider Me Gone", the second single, recalled her early-1990s work.
