5|$|Before his {{execution}} {{a convicted felon}} was usually detained in custody for three market days, on each {{of which he was}} publicly displayed in the stocks, accompanied by the stolen goods. After the sentence had been carried out a county coroner <b>would</b> <b>visit</b> Halifax and convene a jury of 12men, sometimes the same individuals who had found the felon guilty, and ask them to give an account under oath of the circumstances of the conviction and execution, for the official records.|$|E
5|$|Caribbean {{monk seals}} {{were found in}} warm temperate, {{subtropical}} and tropical waters of the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the west Atlantic Ocean. They probably preferred to haul out at sites (low sandy beaches above high tide) on isolated and secluded atolls and islands, but occasionally <b>would</b> <b>visit</b> the mainland coasts and deeper waters offshore. This species may have fed in shallow lagoons and reefs.|$|E

5|$|His mother, Elizabeth Barrow, and {{her three}} {{youngest}} children joined {{her husband in the}} Marshalsea in April 1824. Dickens <b>would</b> <b>visit</b> them every Sunday until he found lodgings in Lant Street, closer to the prison, in the attic of a house belonging to the vestry clerk of St George's Church. This meant he was able to breakfast with his family in the Marshalsea and dine with them after work.|$|E
5|$|In February 1767, Johnson {{was granted}} a special {{audience}} with King George III. This {{took place at the}} library of the Queen's house, and it was organised by Barnard, the King's librarian.

5|$|A point guard, Farmer led Clay County High School to the 1987 Kentucky High School Athletic Association (KHSAA) State Basketball Championship and, in 1988, {{was named}} Kentucky Mr. Basketball and Kentucky Associated Press Male High School Athlete of the Year after setting a {{championship}} game record with 51 {{points in a}} losing effort. Although he was popular state-wide and publicly stated his desire to play collegiate basketball for the Kentucky Wildcats, Coach Eddie Sutton was reluctant to offer Farmer a scholarship. After Farmer announced that he <b>would</b> <b>visit</b> other colleges and issued a deadline past which {{he would no longer}} consider Kentucky without a scholarship offer, Sutton relented and Farmer joined the University of Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} feature that distinguished Maqam al-Khawwas from the Deir Ghassaneh mosque {{was that it}} acted primarily as a women's domain whereas the mosque had largely been a male domain. In the pre-British Mandate era, it was frequented by women {{on a daily basis}} and during a seasonal pilgrimage for women known as mawsim al-banat. During this pilgrimage, which coincided with the Nabi Salih pilgrimage, a largely male affair, large groups of women and children from the villages of Bani Zeid <b>would</b> <b>visit</b> the Khawwas mausoleum to celebrate festivities, socialize with other women and pray. According to Palestinian architecture expert Suad Amiry, Maqam al-Khawwas's isolation and the ritual of having to travel uphill to reach the sanctuary added to the tranquil feeling of the visit.|$|E

5|$|Calvin {{also wrote}} that he was {{prepared}} to follow the Lord's calling. A plan was drawn up in which Viret would be appointed to take temporary charge in Geneva for six months while Bucer and Calvin <b>would</b> <b>visit</b> the city to determine the next steps. The city council pressed for the immediate appointment of Calvin in Geneva. By mid-1541, Strasbourg decided to lend Calvin to Geneva for six months. Calvin returned on 13 September 1541 with an official escort and a wagon for his family.|$|E
5|$|Gossip soon {{spread of}} the {{existence}} of an illegitimate child. Some historians contend that, sometime before August 1800 in Weymouth, Sophia gave birth to a child fathered by Garth. Flora Fraser believes the rumours that Sophia had a child, but has questioned whether the child was fathered by Garth, or Sophia's brother the Duke of Cumberland. Historians further write that the child, baptised Thomas Garth like his father, was raised by his father in Weymouth, where his mother <b>would</b> <b>visit</b> him occasionally. In 1828 he apparently tried to blackmail the royal family with certain incriminating documents from his father about his supposed parents' relationship, though this ended in failure.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Nixon {{published}} his memoirs, RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon, {{the first of}} ten books he was to author in his retirement.

Carter had not wanted to invite Nixon, but Deng had stated he <b>would</b> <b>visit</b> Nixon in California if the former president was not invited. Nixon had a private meeting with Deng and visited Beijing again in mid-1979.|$|E

5|$|McCauley was {{an active}} member of the Edmonton community. He served as a {{director}} of the Edmonton Agricultural Association for 16 years. The association brought the Edmonton Exhibition to Edmonton, one of the prominent fairs of the west at the time. As telephone service was brought to Edmonton, McCauley was one of the first to receive one installed. His telephone number was #1. When John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair <b>would</b> <b>visit</b> Edmonton for business, McCauley and his wife would usually be the ones to entertain him. Also an avid curler, McCauley was a founder of the Royal Curling Club in Edmonton and led his curling team where he served as a skip. He also enjoyed other sports, including horse carriage racing.|$|E
5|$|Michel Roux is {{the brother}} of Albert Roux. Michel has a son named Alain Roux, while Albert's son is Michel Roux, Jr.. When Alain was ten years old, Michel and his wife divorced, with his wife taking British born Alain and his two sisters to France. Alain <b>would</b> <b>visit</b> during the school {{holidays}} and work with Michel in the kitchens and decided {{at the age of}} fourteen that he wanted to become a chef like his father. Michel met his second wife, Robyn Joyce, after being set up on a blind date with her by former apprentice Leigh Stone-Herbert in Sydney, Australia. The relationship has been credited with opening the door to Australian chefs being trained by the Roux brothers.|$|E
5|$|One of Sikorski's {{political}} goals {{was the creation}} of a Central and Eastern European federation, starting with the Polish-Czechoslovakian confederation. He saw such an organization as necessary if smaller states were to stand up to traditional German and Russian imperialism. That concept, although ultimately futile, gained some traction around that time, as Sikorski and Edvard Bene≈° from the Czechoslovak government-in-exile, signed an agreement declaring the intent to pursue closer cooperation on 10 November that year. On 24 December 1940 Sikorski was promoted to genera≈Ç broni. In March 1941 he visited the United States; he <b>would</b> <b>visit</b> USA again in March and December 1942.|$|E

5|$|Paoli kept busy {{performing}} in Italy, South America and the United States. He returned to Puerto Rico in 1923. At the time, Amalia Paoli was residing in San Juan (in the ward of Santurce) {{where she was}} running a singing school (Academia Paoli). Antonio conducted a few performances around the island and then departed to sing at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Manhattan Opera House and the Metropolitan Opera House in Philadelphia. He had wanted to sing in the Metropolitan Opera House in New York, but apparently his competitor Enrico Caruso opposed this. Some attribute this {{to the fact that}} Caruso was a shareholder of the renowned opera house. From the U.S., the tenor <b>would</b> <b>visit</b> Cura√ßao, Cuba, Colombia, Haiti and Ecuador.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona {{would return}} to France six more times {{over the course of}} the next twelve years. Her {{frequent}} visits and excellent reputation made her the cause c√©l√®bre of many French citizens who pitied the queen's fate and admired her gracious acceptance of her new life. Ranavalona's visits were generally accompanied by much media fanfare and the queen's popularity among the French public grew to the extent that she was featured on the box of Petit Beurre cookies in 1916. The queen's second visit to France occurred in September 1903, when she visited Vic-sur-C√®re and Aurillac. Pressure by citizens during this visit succeeded in raising her pension to 37,000 francs. Two years later she <b>would</b> <b>visit</b> Marseilles and Saint-Germain and inhabit a large five-bedroom Parisian apartment in the sixteenth arrondissement from which she would attend the Paris Opera, observe a session of the French House of Representatives and be formally received at the Ministry of the Colonies. Again due to pressure from sympathetic French citizens, Ranavalona's pension was further raised to 50,000 francs per annum. On her next visit in 1907, the queen would use Dives-sur-Mer as a home base to visit the Calvados region, where she was photographed for the French press. From August to September 1910, Ranavalona <b>would</b> <b>visit</b> Paris, Nantes, La Baule and Saint-Nazaire and was repeatedly the target of undesired attention from press photographers. Her 1912 trip to the tiny, remote village of Quiberville would coincide with the increase of her annual pension to 75,000 francs. The queen's final voyage in 1913 would take her to Marseilles, Aix-les-Bains and Allevard.|$|E
5|$|The {{marriage}} {{was not a}} success. By the 1840s, Natalie Benjamin was living in Paris with the couple's only child, Ninette, whom she raised as a Catholic. Benjamin <b>would</b> <b>visit</b> them annually. While a senator, in the late 1850s he persuaded Natalie to rejoin him and expensively furnished a home in Washington for all three to live in. Natalie and their daughter soon embarked again for France. Benjamin, publicly humiliated by his failure to keep Natalie, consigned the household goods to auction. There were rumors, never substantiated, both that Benjamin was impotent, and that Natalie was unfaithful.|$|E
