500|$|It {{has also}} been argued that the {{methodology}} used by modern Egyptologists to translate ancient records is unreliable and unstable, and therefore produces flawed and nonsensical translations. Thus, the modern translations of the Joseph Smith Papyri as produced by Egyptologists {{are not to be}} trusted. This line of thinking was used by Nibley in his 1975 book, The Message of the Joseph Smith Papyri. He wrote: [...] "To the often asked question, 'Have the Joseph Smith Papyri been translated?' The answer is an emphatic no! What, then, is the foregoing? A mechanical transcription, no more [...] What we have is a transmission rather than a translation of the text [...] Though as correct and literal as <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>it,</b> the translation in the preceding chapter is not a translation. It is nonsense." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} Just Dance {{led to the}} {{development}} of a sequel, Just Dance 2, which focused on adding new features and refinements to the game—such as improvements to its motion tracking system, new game modes, and support for downloadable content. Sales of Just Dance 2 surpassed that of the original; with over 5 million copies as of January 2011, it was the best-selling third-party title for the Wii. Laurent Detoc, CEO of Ubisoft's North American operations, stated that this achievement [...] " [...] the Just Dance brand as a pop culture phenomenon." [...] Poix felt that [...] "there's a pressure within Ubisoft to keep Just Dance enormous, and we think <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> enormous. But it wasn't like that initially, because at the end of the first one, people—even us—had our doubts that it would last. After the first one we thought maybe there would be a second one, and then it would be over." ...|$|E

2500|$|There was {{initially}} uncertainty over whether a third series would be produced. In an April 2008 interview, Jones said [...] "We {{never intended to}} write a second series let alone a third. We don't want it to become predictable. We will see how the Christmas special goes and take it from there." [...] Corden added: [...] "We will write one if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> better. We have {{to be true to}} ourselves." [...] Corden and Jones completed the final draft of the Christmas Special by September 2008, although they ruled out writing the third series at the time due to pressures of other work, and repeating the wish not to produce a sub-standard script. After the 2008 Christmas special premiere, BBC Three aired a making-of documentary about the special, titled 12 Days of Christmas.|$|E

[...] The clip fulfilled the intention of [...] "creating a world around her," [...] desiring to have an [...] "iconic" [...] aura. Kahn exclaimed [...] "the great thing about Janet is that her videos go all out, and that's risk-taking. She's not just doing what other people are doing, she's willing to go and try to create something new." [...] Jackson responded [...] "I enjoy trying different things, video wise as well as make-up and costuming, that's fun for me.

5000|$|In late July, 2008, federal legislators reached {{agreement}} on improving children's product safety. The course of KID's {{role in the}} legislation and {{the portion of the}} law named in honor of Danny Keysar was described in the Chicago Tribune as follows:Ginzel has spent the last decade pushing for tougher testing of children's products before they're sold and more effective ways of sweeping dangerous products off store shelves...."We'd rather have our son," [...] Ginzel said, choking up. [...] "But whatever <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do to protect other families-it's not really a choice <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>make.</b> <b>It's</b> something <b>we</b> have to do"....That part of the law (named after Danny Keysar) forces the US Consumer Product Safety Commission to enact tougher safety rules for durable nursery products, including cribs, and requires that manufacturers test their products to those standards before they're sold.|$|R

In May 2015, former star Sam Waterston (EADA/DA Jack McCoy) announced to The Hollywood Reporter that he supports and would join a revival of Law & Order, saying: [...] "You're darn right. Sure, I'd love it. Got to break the record." [...] Creator Dick Wolf has expressed wanting to use a L revival to do a [...] "ripped from the headlines" [...] storyline surrounding the murder trial of Robert Durst, Wolf said [...] " [...] I'd bring back Law & Order.

2500|$|Following an April 2008 set visit, Meyer {{opined that}} Pattinson and Stewart had {{developed}} chemistry so good it [...] "may cause hyperventilation". Pattinson revealed that Meyer {{had given him}} an early copy of Midnight Sun—a re-telling {{of the events of}} Twilight, narrated from Edward's point of view. He explained that: [...] "That is what I liked about [...] the job, because the guy doesn’t really exist that much, so you can just create whatever you want. Then, when I found out there was another book from Edward’s perspective, [...] we had the same perspective!" [...] In preparation for the role, Pattinson wrote journal entries as Edward and distanced from his friends and family, explaining that he [...] "wanted to feel his isolation". Physically, he revealed that; [...] "I was supposed to get a six-pack. But it didn't really work out." [...] One scene in the story sees Edward, a gifted pianist, compose a lullaby for Bella. Pattinson was given the opportunity to submit a composition for consideration for this scene, with Hardwicke stating; [...] "I told him he should write one, and let’s see if <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> work, because that would be really cool if it was Rob’s song. He’s a beautiful musician, a very creative soul, very similar to Edward. He just totally reads the most interesting stuff, and sees the most interesting movies, and is very introspective and diving into his existential self." [...] Meyer approved; [...] "If Robert could write a lullaby, that would definitely add to some of the mystique of the movie, wouldn’t it?" [...] While two of Pattinson's compositions do feature in the final film, the lullaby piece finally selected was composed by Carter Burwell.|$|E
