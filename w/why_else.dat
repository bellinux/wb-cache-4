500|$|On 16 December 1784, St. James's Chronicle stated Hawkins and Boswell {{were both}} writing biographies. However, Thomas Tyers {{published}} before them when his A Biographical Sketch of Dr Samuel Johnson, the first postmortem biographical work on Johnson {{but not a}} full-length biography, ran in the December 1784 issue of The Gentleman's Magazine. This did not deter Hawkins and by 21 December 1784, he began advertising his [...] "authentick" [...] life of Johnson. This provoked an anonymous articles in St. James's Chronicle started attacking Hawkins: [...] "It {{is evident from the}} Conduct of the late Dr. Johnson, that he designed Mr. Boswell for the sole Writer of his Life. <b>Why</b> <b>else</b> did he furnish him with such Materials for it as were withheld from every other Friend ... Little indeed did he suppose that a Person whom he had made one of his Executors would have instantly claimed the Office of his Biographer. Still less could he have imagined that this Self-Appointment would have been precipitately confirmed by the Booksellers." ...|$|E
500|$|Matt Hurwitz and Chris Knowles {{referred}} to the episode as [...] "controversial" [...] in their 2008 book, The Complete X-Files. Kenneth Silber from Space.com was critical of the episode, writing that [...] "this episode vividly demonstrates that what Carl Sagan once called 'the burden of skepticism' is no longer being shouldered by anyone in the series. <b>Why</b> <b>else</b> would Mulder's assertion that a necromancer has successfully raised the dead provoke such a languid response {{in a room full}} of FBI agents?" [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one-and-a-half stars out of five, noting that the episode's premise felt, [...] "stylistically wrong for Millennium." [...] Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson argued the episode was [...] "a terrible X-File" [...] because, instead of featuring Mulder and Scully solving a mystery, the plot revolved around the two saving the world from Armageddon, which caused [...] "the thin credibility upon which hangs the series [...]" [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris noted that, despite the teaser and first act being [...] "promising enough", the episode [...] "slides downhill rapidly with a storyline that crosses the border into ludicrous." ...|$|E
2500|$|Asked why, {{given the}} clear {{advantage}} {{that seemed to}} offer, Mitsubishi would have written into what Rodriguez-Ramon contended was an adhesion contract such a narrow arbitration clause, the lawyer insisted that [...] "Mitsubishi only considered the possibility of arbitrating commercial contractual controversy." [...] <b>Why</b> <b>else,</b> he suggested, would {{the language of the}} arbitration clause have specifically mentioned the sections of the contract to which it applied? And even if it had been intended so broadly, he reminded the Court that it had held in many other cases that some statutory claims could not be arbitrated.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his book}} The Israel–Palestine Conflict: One Hundred Years of War, James L. Gelvin states that [...] "Palestinian {{nationalism}} {{emerged during the}} interwar period in response to Zionist immigration and settlement." [...] However, this does not make Palestinian identity any less legitimate: [...] "The fact that Palestinian nationalism developed later than Zionism and indeed {{in response to it}} does not in any way diminish the legitimacy of Palestinian nationalism or make it less valid than Zionism. All nationalisms arise in opposition to some [...] "other." [...] <b>Why</b> <b>else</b> would there be the need to specify who you are? And all nationalisms are defined by what they oppose." ...|$|E
2500|$|Justice Stevens {{opined that}} the Court's {{precedent}} required it {{to strike down}} Nevada's stop-and-identify law. [...] Under the Court's Terry jurisprudence, a suspect has always {{had the right to}} refuse to answer questions put to him by police officers during a Terry stop. [...] And the Fifth Amendment privilege had always attached during custodial interrogations because information extorted by the police during such interrogations is unavoidably testimonial. [...] <b>Why</b> <b>else</b> would the police ask for a person's name, if not to determine whether that person was either wanted for committing a crime or directly suspected of committing a crime? [...] "The officer in this case told [...] that he was conducting an investigation and needed to see some identification. [...] As the target of that investigation, , in my view, acted well within his rights when he opted to stand mute. [...] Accordingly, I respectfully dissent." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{studying}} compliance, social psychologists aim {{to examine}} overt and subtle social influences experienced {{in various forms}} by all individuals.
