50|$|After the {{breeding}} season, the <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swallow</b> forms flocks that sometimes consist {{of hundreds of}} individuals. These flocks frequently consist of both the <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swallow</b> and other species of swallows.|$|E
50|$|The {{shiny cowbird}} is a brood {{parasite}} that occasionally lays its {{eggs in the}} nest of <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swallow.</b> After a shiny cowbird fledges, it exhibits behaviour that causes it to be fed more, much {{to the detriment of}} <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swallow</b> nestlings. About six percent of nests are affected by this. This swallow has been known to lose nests to the southern house wren, a subspecies of the house wren.|$|E
50|$|It {{is similar}} to the <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swallow,</b> but lacks the white {{forehead}} of that species and has bluer upperparts and grey underwing-coverts. In addition to this, the breeding ranges of the two have almost no overlap.|$|E
40|$|Female {{birds that}} engage in extrapair mating may choose extrapair mates that are genetically compatible, {{increasing}} their fitness through genetic benefits, such as increased heterozygosity, to their offspring; or choose mates that are heterozygous at {{one or more}} loci. Here, we describe the extrapair mating system, explore the fitness benefits of extrapair mating and test the heterozygosity hypothesis in <b>White-rumped</b> <b>Swallows</b> (Tachycineta leucorrhoa) breeding in Argentina using a panel of microsatellite loci. Extrapair offspring accounted for 56 % of the nestlings and 77 % of the broods in our population. Within broods, 1 [...] 4 males fathered extrapair offspring, and in 29 % of nests, all offspring were from extrapair sires. We found that broods with extrapair offspring fledged overall more young than broods with no extrapair offspring but that the young that died were more heterozygous than the ones that fledged. Although extrapair offspring had a higher probability of surviving than within-pair offspring, these 2 {{groups did not differ}} in their level of heterozygosity. Neither the heterozygosity of the social mate nor the genetic similarity of the social pair predicted the presence of extrapair young. Instead, females chose social mates that were significantly less genetically similar to them. Our results do not support the heterozygosity hypothesis and contradict 2 of its main predictions.

50|$|The {{song of the}} <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swallow</b> {{is often}} {{described}} as a soft gurgling or a broken warble. It usually sings while flying at dawn. The call is described as a quick and toneless zzt. The alarm note it uses is short and harsh.|$|E
50|$|This swallow {{is similar}} to the Chilean swallow but can be {{differentiated}} by the Chilean swallow's lack of a supraloral white streak. The Chilean swallow also seems to keep its glossy blue upperparts when not breeding. The <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swallow</b> is, in addition, larger than the Chilean swallow.|$|E
50|$|The {{breeding}} {{season of the}} <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swallow</b> is from October to December in Brazil, and from October to February in Argentina. During this period, one brood is usually laid, although it will occasionally lay a second brood. On average, 58 percent of nests will fledge at least one chick.|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swallow</b> is {{an aerial}} {{insectivore}} that usually feeds {{alone or in}} small groups, feeding on flies, beetles, flying ants, Orthoptera, and Lepidoptera. It usually feeds close over water, pastures, and open woodland. Occasionally skimming the ground, its flight is fast and direct. It follows humans and other animals, and can usually be seen near humans and animals that are disturbing insects.|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swallow</b> is {{classified}} as a least-concern species by the IUCN. This is due to its large range, estimated to be 5580000 km2, its increase in population, and its large population. Increase in the availability of artificial nest sites may benefit this bird, and could {{be a factor in}} its increasing population. It is described as being fairly common in its range.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swallow</b> {{was first}} {{formally}} described as Hirundo leucorrhoa by French ornithologist Louis Vieillot in 1817 in his Nouveau Dictionnaire d'Histoire Naturelle. It was since moved {{to its current}} genus, Tachycineta, which was created in 1850 by Jean Cabanis. The binomial name is derived from Ancient Greek. Tachycineta is from takhukinetos, [...] "moving quickly", and the specific leucorrhoa is from leukos, [...] "white", and orrhos, [...] "rump".|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swallow</b> {{measures}} 13 cm {{in length}} and weighs 17 - 21 g. It has an average wingspan of 115.7 mm. It has a white supraloral streak, a white streak above its eye, and black lores and ear coverts. The lores and ear-coverts have a blue-green gloss. It has black wings, with white tips on its inner secondaries, tertials, and greater wing-coverts. The white tips erode with age. The tail is black and has a shallow fork. The <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swallow</b> also has, as the name implies, a white rump. The rump is not totally white; it has some fine shaft streaks. The rest of the upperparts, {{in addition to the}} crown, nape, and forehead, are a glossy blue. These features, when this bird is not breeding, are more greenish-blue. The underparts and underwing-coverts are white. The bill, legs, and feet are black, and the irides are brown. The sexes are alike, and the juvenile can be distinguished by its dusky breast {{and the fact that it}} is duller and more brownish.|$|E
50|$|The {{species was}} {{formerly}} considered a subspecies of the Chilean swallow, most {{likely due to}} the similarity in morphology and calls. It is occasionally placed in the genus Iridoprocne with the tree swallow, mangrove swallow, white-winged swallow, and Chilean swallow. A study of the mitochondrial DNA of Tachycineta supports the split, although studies do show that the <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swallow</b> forms a superspecies, leucorrhoa, with the Chilean swallow. This species is monotypic, with no known subspecies.|$|E
50|$|This swallow {{is found}} in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay. Its natural {{habitats}} are dry savanna, pastureland, the edge of forests, and subtropical or tropical seasonally wet or flooded lowland grassland. It is classified as a least-concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Its population is increasing and it may benefit from the increase in availability of artificial nest sites. The shiny cowbird is an occasional brood parasite of the <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swallow.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The new genus Tachycineta {{was created}} for this group of {{swallows}} by German ornithologist Jean Cabanis in 1850. The current genus name Tachycineta, is from Ancient Greek takhukinetos, [...] "moving quickly", and the specific meyeni commemorates Prussian botanist and collector Franz Meyen. It should be noted, although, that some consider the species name to be leucopyga, {{which is what the}} species name originally was. This species, along with the <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swallow,</b> T. leucorrhoa, form a superspecies. This species is monotypic.|$|E
50|$|This species usually builds its nest in {{holes in}} trees or dead snags or under or in {{artificial}} structures like fence posts and the eaves of buildings. The <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swallow</b> is solitary and nests in distributed pairs during the breeding season. The breeding season is from October to December in Brazil and from October to February in neighboring Argentina. Usually, only one brood with four to seven eggs is laid, although {{a second one}} will occasionally be laid. The female incubates the eggs over a period usually between 15 and 16 days, with the fledging after usually between 21 and 25 days.|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swallow</b> builds nests in holes or crevices {{in a tree}} or dead snag. It also builds them in {{artificial}} structures like {{holes in}} fence posts or under eaves, typically under those of abandoned buildings. This swallow will sometimes reuse favourable nest sites, which has {{a positive effect on}} fledgling survival. It occasionally nests in abandoned nests of the firewood-gatherer. The nests themselves are usually made of plant fibres and lined with hair and feathers. This swallow is solitary and, during the breeding season, is scattered in pairs. Pairs can be seen to fight and chase each other at the nest site.|$|E
5000|$|All nine Tachycineta {{species have}} glossy {{blue or green}} backs and white underparts, but the five species with white rumps [...] - [...] the {{mangrove}} swallow, Tumbes swallow, white-winged swallow, <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swallow</b> and Chilean swallow [...] - [...] are particularly closely related, the first three and the last two forming two superspecies. The Tumbes swallow of coastal Peru was formerly {{considered to be a}} subspecies of the mangrove swallow, but its calls, behaviour, and cytochrome b data indicate that it should be considered as a separate species. It is also differentiated from the mangrove swallow by its lack of a supraloral white line and by its slight difference in size.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mangrove}} swallow (Tachycineta albilinea) is a passerine {{bird in the}} swallow {{family that}} breeds in coastal regions from Mexico through Central America to Panama. It has blue-green upperparts, blackish flight feathers, a white rump, a black tail, and white underparts. It can be identified by the [...] white streak, the white line near its eye, which only occurs in two other species of Tachycineta: the violet-green swallow and the <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swallow.</b> The sexes, although similar in plumage, differ slightly in size. The juveniles have grey-brown upperparts and white-washed underparts. This swallow's song is generally described as a soft trilling, with a rolled jeerrt call, and a sharp alarm note.|$|E
50|$|The clutch {{is usually}} four to seven eggs that {{transition}} from pinkish-white when laid to pure white. The eggs measure 19.6 x 13.7 mm and weigh 1.9 g on average. Clutch size and egg size are noted to usually decrease as the breeding season progresses. Late-season nestlings also weigh less than early-season nestlings. It takes 15 to 16 {{days for the}} female to incubate the clutch. About 58 percent of the broods hatch synchronously, although the hatching sometimes lasts over four days. On average, 78 percent of the eggs will hatch. The fledging period is 21 to 25 days, with about 95 percent of the nestlings fledging. The <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swallow,</b> on average, lives for 2.12 years. The male lives slightly longer than the female.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swallow</b> (Tachycineta leucorrhoa) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Hirundinidae. First {{described}} and given its binomial name by French ornithologist Louis Vieillot in 1817, it was for many years considered a subspecies of the Chilean swallow. The species is monotypic with no known population variations. It has a white [...] streak, or streak above its lores (the region between a bird's eye and nostrils), {{which can be used}} to differentiate it from the Chilean swallow. The lores, ear coverts, tail, and wings are black, with white tips on the inner secondaries, tertials, and greater coverts of the wings. The rest of the [...] are a glossy blue. Its underparts and underwing-coverts are white, in addition to the rump, as the name suggests. The sexes are similar, and the juvenile is duller and browner with a dusky breast.|$|E
50|$|A {{relatively}} small swallow, the mangrove swallow is 11 - 12 cm long and weighs about 14 g. The adult has iridescent blue-green upperparts, white underparts, rump, and undertail- and wing-coverts, and blackish tail and flight feathers. The feathers are greener when fresh and bluer when worn. The white underparts sometimes have faint, dark shaft streaks. The bill {{is small and}} black, about 11 mm long. The iris is a dark brown, and the tarsus and toes range in colour from black to fuscous-brown. The lores are black and have a thin white line above them. Two other species of Tachycineta have this distinctive feature: the violet-green swallow and the <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swallow.</b> The adult's tail is only slightly forked. The sexes are similar, although they differ slightly in size. Compared to the male, the female has a slightly longer tail and slightly shorter wings. The juvenile is dull grey-brown above and grey-brown washed white below. Occasionally, the juvenile's upperparts have a subtle, greenish gloss.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, after {{watching}} {{an episode of}} Grizzly Adams on television, Peter decides to grow a beard, despite Lois' disapproval. After his beard is fully grown, the Griffin family decide {{to go out for}} dinner, but are soon pestered by a <b>white-rumped</b> <b>swallow,</b> who eventually settles in Peter's facial hair. Unaware that the bird is actually an endangered species, Peter attempts to remove the bird, but is soon threatened with jailtime if he does so. Left with no other choice but to let the bird live within his hair, Peter attempts to continue life as normally as possible, until he can no longer take the bird's constant squawking, and decides to shoot the bird. Stopped at the last second by Lois, Peter accidentally shoots a nearby window, causing the bird to fly out. Thankful that the bird is finally gone, the two soon hear peeping coming from inside his facial hair, and discover three small baby birds. Won over by their resemblance to his own children, he decides to keep the baby birds, and take the place of its mother. As time goes on, he becomes reluctant to release the birds once they have become fully grown, but is ultimately convinced by Lois to release them back into the wilderness once they attempt to fly out of their bedroom window. He does release them, and then he shaves the beard.|$|E
