While in the US, Nhất Hạnh stopped at Gethsemani Abbey to speak with Thomas Merton. When Vietnam threatened to block Nhất Hạnh's re-entry to the country, Merton penned an essay of solidarity entitled [...] "Nhat Hanh is my Brother". He had written a letter to Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1965 entitled: [...] "In Search of the Enemy of Man". It was during his 1966 stay in the US that Nhất Hạnh met with King and urged him to publicly denounce the Vietnam War. In 1967, Dr. King gave a famous speech at the Riverside Church in New York City, his first to publicly question the U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Later that year, Dr. King nominated Nhất Hạnh for the 1967 Nobel Peace Prize. In his nomination Dr. King said, [...] "I do not personally know of anyone more worthy of [...] than this gentle monk from Vietnam. His ideas for peace, if applied, would build a monument to ecumenism, to <b>world</b> <b>brotherhood,</b> to humanity". The fact that King had revealed the candidate he had chosen to nominate and had made a [...] "strong request" [...] to the prize committee, was in sharp violation of the Nobel traditions and protocol.
