5|$|The {{character}} is introduced {{as a boy}} genius from the year 2012 who attracts {{the attention of the}} Doctor's traveling companion Rose after she and the Doctor meet him in his place of work. Despite Rose's <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> Adam as a fellow traveller, the Doctor is skeptical. After Adam attempts to use information from the future for his own gain he throws Adam out of his time machine, the TARDIS. This was the first example of the Doctor forcing a companion to leave because of negative behaviour.|$|E
5|$|According to Nolutshungu, the 1984 {{bilateral}} Franco-Libyan agreement {{may have}} provided Gaddafi with {{an excellent opportunity}} to find an exit from the Chadian quagmire, while bolstering his international prestige and giving him an opportunity to force Habré into accepting a peace accord which would have included Libya's proxies. Instead, Gaddafi misread France's withdrawal as a <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> Libya's military presence in Chad and the de facto annexation of the whole BET Prefecture by Libya, an action that was certain to meet the opposition of all Chadian factions and of the OAU and UN. Gaddafi's blunder would eventually bring about his defeat, with the rebellion against him of the GUNT and a new French expedition in 1986.|$|E

40|$|The Moral Sentiment in Britain and the United States is changing. There is {{no longer}} a such a <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>accepted</b> high and often rising levels of {{economic}} inequality. Coupled with this is a growing refusal <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> what now appear to be arguments in support of high inequality. The ‘new urban crisis’ is a book whose time has passed, a book which contains arguments for some people being very creative and others not which are now widely greeted with distain. We are very possibly at a tipping point and economically inequality in countries worldwide may be beginning again to fall. The last such tipping point occurred in 1913 as the Titanic sank. It was most likely greatly aided, if not partly caused, by the First World War. If the moral sentiment is changing now with widespread war that is even more reason to hope for a better future...|$|R
5|$|Discussions {{proceeded}} rapidly {{during the}} week, {{but did not}} touch {{on the issue of}} Lisbon until the fifth day, 26 July, when Hughes and Johnston met with Smith, Deputy Prime Minister Clifford Dupont, and Trade and Industry Minister George Rudland. Dupont opened the discussion by referring to Sandys' statement from 1963, which said the Rhodesian government would retain any rights previously granted to the Federation, which Dupont reasoned surely included the ability given in 1957 to appoint its own overseas agents if it informed Britain. As Portugal had indicated its <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> a Rhodesian diplomat, Dupont said, the Rhodesian government was acting perfectly within its rights.|$|E
5|$|Between his two matches against Janowski, Lasker {{arranged}} another World Chess Championship in January–February 1910 against Carl Schlechter. Schlechter was {{a modest}} gentleman, who was generally unlikely {{to win the}} major chess tournaments by his peaceful inclination, his lack of aggressiveness and his <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> most draw offers from his opponents (about 80% of his games finished by a draw). The conditions of the match against Lasker are still debated among chess historians, but it seems Schlechter accepted to play under very unfavourable conditions, notably that {{he would need to}} finish two points ahead of Lasker to be declared the winner of the match, and he would need to win a revenge match to be declared World Champion. The match was originally meant to consist of 30 games, but when it became obvious that there were insufficient funds (Lasker demanded a fee of 1,000 marks per game played), the number of games was reduced to ten, making the margin of two points all the more difficult.|$|E

Physician experiences and perspectives were investigated in regard to reimbursement, formulary limitations, pre-authorizations, specialty referrals, responsiveness to problems, and patient knowledge of their plans. The <b>willingness</b> of physicians <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> new patients from specific insurance company programs clearly correlated with the difficulties and limitations physicians perceive in working with the companies (p < 0. 0012). Survey results indicate that providers in private practice {{were much more likely}} <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> University Health Alliance (UHA) and Hawai‘i Medical Services Association (HMSA) Commercial insurance than Aloha Care Advantage and Aloha Quest. This was likely related to the more favorable impressions of the services, payments, and lower administrative burden offered by those companies compared with others...|$|R

40|$|We {{construct}} a spatially explicit agent-based {{model of a}} bilateral land market. Heterogeneous agents form their bid and ask prices for land based on the utility that they obtain from a certain location (houte/land) and base {{on the state of}} the market (an excess of demand or supply). We underline the distinction between bid/ask price and individual <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> pay/to <b>accept</b> and show that variations between them that reflect market conditions can influence land prices. Agents sort among locations with respect to distance from the city center and environmental spatial externalities. Aggregated outcocomes such as land patterns and land prices are producee by the model. The basic model of buyers and sellers trading land in the urban area produces results identical to the monocentric urban model. however, more complex dynamics appears when environmental amenities and market-adjustment variable influence the formation of land prices...|$|R
40|$|A physician's Medicare {{assignment}} rate is {{one measure}} {{of his or her}} <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> participate in the Medicare program.

General-ly, Medicare reasonable fees are lower than the payment which a physician receives from providing the same service to a private patient or to a Medicare patient who is not treated on assignment. Because Medicare eligibles not treated on an assigned basis are financially liable for the difference be-tween the physician's charge and the Medicare reasonable fee, the assignment rate is an indication of the out-of-pocket costs borne by Medicare eligibles.

25|$|A similar {{breakdown}} {{is employed}} in environmental analysis of total economic value. Both {{costs and benefits}} can be diverse. Financial costs tend to be most thoroughly represented in cost-benefit analyses due to relatively abundant market data.

25|$|Skilled, {{highly trained}} and very fit freedivers can often go {{as deep as}} {{recreational}} scuba divers, and sometimes deeper, but for a very much shorter time. Recreational scuba diving is generally limited by diver certification {{to a maximum of}} 40 meters, for reasons of safety. Recreational divers who dive to deeper depths are generally expected by the certification agencies to have technical diver training, while freediving is only limited by the divers ability and <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> the risks. The risks of freediving to these depths are significant, and a major difference is that recreational scuba certification agencies specify depth restrictions to avoid liablity issues, while freedivers are left to make their own choices regarding risk acceptance. Recreational freediving is practiced by many people ranging from the average snorkeler to the professional freediver. Recreational freediving is also frequently practiced in freshwater springs due to excellent visibility.|$|E
25|$|Green related an estrangement between Wynne and Edmonds, over Edmonds' <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> Gough's objections. Edmonds sent Wynne to meet Gough, {{which led}} to a {{substantial}} change in Wynne's point of view. Wynne revised the draft to remove much of the blame from Gough, writing that Haig bore principal responsibility for the Fifth Army plan in the third (1945) draft. Edmonds then found this draft objectionable and quarrelled with Wynne, who declined to be named as an author. Green wrote that Edmonds and Wynne had changed their views about Gough and made the narrative of his role in the events of 1917 much more accurate, it being noticeably less defensive of Haig. Wynne's conclusion had been that the strategy of retaining the initiative to protect the French Army had worked and that the tactical intention to clear the Belgian coast had failed, due to an underestimation of German resilience and the mistaken attempt at a breakthrough.|$|E

40|$|This study {{addresses}} the relative underdevelopment of high tech {{industries in the}} Eurozone compared to high tech industries in the US. Based on a review of previous studies this study identifies a paradox, in which limited acquisition of early stage venture capital hinders the growth of New Technology Based Firms (NTBFs) in the Eurozone, and in which underdevelopment of NTBFs results in the lagging development of high tech industries in the Eurozone. Further exploration of this paradox shows that it comprises an industry as well a firm level dimension, namely the market dynamics of HHTIs in the Eurozone and the <b>willingness</b> by NTBFs <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> early stage venture capital in the Eurozone. The study of these two dimensions leads {{to a discussion of}} technology-push versus demand-pull. The results show that ‘well developed’ industries in terms of relatively high R&D intensities go along with relatively more demand-pull in early stages of the development process of NTBFs. In addition this study relates a smaller <b>willingness</b> by NTBFs <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> early stage venture capital to the presence of relatively less tech technology-push at later stage in development process of NTBFs.

25|$|Like many spiritually minded Russians, Rasputin {{spoke of}} {{salvation}} as depending {{less on the}} clergy and the church than on seeking the spirit of God within. He also maintained that sin and repentance were interdependent and necessary to salvation. Thus, he claimed that yielding to temptation (and, for him personally, this meant sex and alcohol), even {{for the purposes of}} humiliation (so as to dispel the sin of vanity), was needed to proceed to repentance and salvation. Rasputin was deeply opposed to war, both from a moral point of view and as something which was likely to lead to political catastrophe. During the years of World War I, Rasputin's increasing drunkenness, sexual promiscuity and <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> bribes (in return for helping petitioners who flocked to his apartment), as well as his efforts to have his critics dismissed from their posts, made him appear increasingly cynical.

25|$|Details of the {{negotiations}} between Kane and Young are unfortunately unclear. It seems that Kane successfully convinced Young to accept Buchanan's appointment of Cumming as Territorial governor, although Young had expressed his <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> such terms {{at the very beginning}} of the crisis. It is uncertain if Kane was able to convince Young at this time to allow the army into Utah. However, in early March Kane traveled to the Johnston's winter base at Fort Bridger. Although his relationship with Colonel Johnston was poor, he eventually persuaded Governor Cumming to travel to Salt Lake City without his military escort under guarantee of safe conduct. As they descended Echo Canyon to Salt Lake city, Kane and the Mormon militia men successfully fooled Cumming as to the size of the armed contingent lining the canyon, something of which Cumming later complained bitterly. Cumming was courteously received by Young and the Utah citizenry in mid-April, and was shortly installed in his new office. Cumming thereafter became a moderate voice, and opposed the hard-line against the Mormons proposed by Colonel Johnston and other federal officials still at Camp Scott. Kane left Utah Territory for Washington, D.C. in May to report to President Buchanan on the results of his mission.|$|E
