5|$|In June 2010, some 43 {{days after}} Kepler came online, its {{operating}} scientists submitted {{a list of}} over 700 exoplanet candidates for review. Of those, five were originally suspected {{to have more than}} one planet. Kepler-9 was one of the multiplanetary systems; it was identified as such <b>when</b> <b>scientists</b> noticed significant variations in the time intervals at which Kepler-9 was transited. Kepler-9 holds the first multiplanetary system discovered using the transit method. It is also the first planetary system where transiting planets were confirmed through transit timing variations method, allowing to calculate the masses of planets. The discovery of the planets was announced on August 26, 2010.|$|E
5|$|Novomessor was synonymized in 1974, {{although}} {{evidence to}} retain it as a valid genus emerged <b>when</b> <b>scientists</b> discovered an exocrine gastral glandular system in two Novomessor species and none in Aphaenogaster. However, N. ensifer {{does not have}} this glandular system. English myrmecologist Barry Bolton argues that basing the genus on such feature cannot justify the separation of Novomessor and Aphaenogaster. In 2015, a phylogenetic study concluded that Novomessor was genetically distinct from Aphaenogaster, and the genus was revived from synonymy to include N. ensifer, N. albisetosus and N. cockerelli as members of it.|$|E
5|$|The {{loss of his}} {{security}} clearance ended Oppenheimer's role in government and policy. He became an academic exile, cut off from his former career and the world he had helped to create. The reputations {{of those who had}} testified against Oppenheimer were tarnished as well, and Oppenheimer's reputation was later partly rehabilitated by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. The brief period <b>when</b> <b>scientists</b> were hailed as heroes uniquely qualified to comment on public policy was ended, and scientists working within the government were on notice that dissent was no longer tolerated.|$|E

50|$|The {{term was}} used as early as 1973, <b>when</b> <b>scientist</b> Carl Sagan {{described}} it and other human chauvinisms that limit imagination of possible extraterrestrial life.

5|$|Scientific {{investigation}} {{has resulted in}} several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet. In the West, belief in a flat Earth was displaced {{by the idea of}} spherical Earth, credited to Pythagoras in the 6th century BC. Earth was further believed {{to be the center of}} the universe until the 16th century <b>when</b> <b>scientists</b> first theorized that it was a moving object, comparable to the other planets in the Solar System. Due to the efforts of influential Christian scholars and clerics such as James Ussher, who sought to determine the age of Earth through analysis of genealogies in Scripture, Westerners before the 19th century generally believed Earth to be a few thousand years old at most. It was only during the 19th century that geologists realized Earth's age was at least many millions of years.|$|E

25|$|India's {{interest}} in space travel {{began in the}} early 1960s, <b>when</b> <b>scientists</b> launched a Nike-Apache rocket from TERLS, Kerala.

25|$|<b>When</b> <b>scientists</b> use {{the idea}} of parsimony, it has meaning only in a very {{specific}} context of inquiry. Several background assumptions are required for parsimony to connect with plausibility in a particular research problem. The reasonableness of parsimony in one research context may {{have nothing to do}} with its reasonableness in another. It is a mistake to think that there is a single global principle that spans diverse subject matter.|$|E
25|$|A {{scientific}} revolution occurs, {{according to}} Kuhn, <b>when</b> <b>scientists</b> encounter anomalies that cannot {{be explained by}} the universally accepted paradigm within which scientific progress has thereto been made. The paradigm, in Kuhn's view, is not simply the current theory, but the entire worldview in which it exists, and all of the implications which come with it.

After more than a century of warning mariners away from the treacherous reef, the lighthouse was given a new mission in 2008 <b>when</b> <b>scientists</b> placed equipment atop the tower to measure whether increased evaporation was the cause of receding Great Lakes water levels.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{inquiry into}} the wave nature of light began in the 17th and 18th centuries, <b>when</b> <b>scientists</b> such as Robert Hooke, Christiaan Huygens and Leonhard Euler {{proposed}} a wave theory of light based on experimental observations. In 1803, Thomas Young, an English polymath, performed the famous double-slit experiment that he later described in a paper titled On the nature of light and colours. This experiment {{played a major role}} in the general acceptance of the wave theory of light.|$|E
25|$|<b>When</b> <b>scientists</b> {{were given}} the {{opportunity}} to study the webs, they discovered that the space webs were finer than normal Earth webs, and although the patterns of the web were not totally dissimilar, variations were spotted, and there was a definite difference in the characteristics of the web. Additionally, while the webs were finer overall, the space web had variations in thickness in places: some places were slightly thinner, and others slightly thicker. This was unusual, because Earth webs have been observed to have uniform thickness.|$|E

500|$|Criticality {{accidents}} {{have occurred}} in the past, some of them with lethal consequences. Careless handling of tungsten carbide bricks around a 6.2kg plutonium sphere resulted in a fatal dose of radiation at Los Alamos on August 21, 1945, <b>when</b> <b>scientist</b> Harry Daghlian received a dose estimated to be 5.1sievert (510rems) and died 25days later. Nine months later, another Los Alamos scientist, Louis Slotin, died from a similar accident involving a beryllium reflector and the same plutonium core (the so-called [...] "demon core") that had previously claimed the life of Daghlian.|$|R
25|$|During the 17th and 18th century, <b>when</b> <b>scientists</b> began {{analysing}} the Earth's atmosphere, gases such as hydrogen {{were discovered}} {{which in turn}} led to the invention of hydrogen balloons. Various theories in mechanics by physicists {{during the same period}} of time—notably fluid dynamics and Newton's laws of motion—led to the foundation of modern aerodynamics. Tethered balloons filled with hot air were used {{in the first half of}} the 19th century and saw considerable action in several mid-century wars, most notably the American Civil War, where balloons provided observation during the Siege of Petersburg.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, <b>when</b> <b>scientists</b> were just {{discovering}} the potential uses of radiation to treat disease, little {{was known about}} safe dosage levels and precise methods of delivery. At that time, radiation was used to treat a variety of noncancerous medical problems, including enlargement of the tonsils, adenoids, and thymus gland. Later, researchers found that high doses of radiation caused soft-tissue sarcomas in some patients. Because of this risk, radiation treatment for cancer is now planned {{to ensure that the}} maximum dosage of radiation is delivered to diseased tissue while surrounding healthy tissue is protected as much as possible.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the reason}} that {{positive}} science, according to Giddens, is never possible in the social sciences: every time an investigator tries to identify causal sequences of action, the actors can change their further line of action. The problem is, however, that conflicting viewpoints in social science result in a disinterest of the people. For example, <b>when</b> <b>scientists</b> don't agree about the greenhouse-effect, people will withdraw from that arena, and deny that there is a problem. Therefore, the more the sciences expand, the more uncertainty there is in the modern society. In this regard, the juggernaut gets even more steerless.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} this was seen <b>when</b> <b>scientists</b> studied red winged blackbirds. These birds are known for {{remaining}} in monogamous relationships {{during the course of}} mating season. During the course of the study, the researchers gave a few select males vasectomies just before mating season. The male birds behaved like they do every season, establishing territory, finding a mate, and attempting to make baby birds. Despite apparent social monogamy, the female birds whose partners were surgically altered still became pregnant, indicating that overt social monogamy did not predict for sexual fidelity. These babies were cared for by their sterile adoptive fathers.|$|E
25|$|Others such as Francis Collins, Kenneth R. Miller, George Coyne and Francisco J. Ayala {{argue for}} {{compatibility}} {{since they do}} not agree that science is incompatible with religion and vice versa. They argue that science provides many opportunities to look for and find God in nature and {{to reflect on their}} beliefs. According to Kenneth Miller, he disagrees with Jerry Coyne's assessment and argues that since significant portions of scientists are religious and the proportion of Americans believing in evolution is much higher, it implies that both are indeed compatible. Elsewhere, Miller has argued that <b>when</b> <b>scientists</b> make claims on science and theism or atheism, they are not arguing scientifically at all and are stepping beyond the scope of science into discourses of meaning and purpose. What he finds particularly odd and unjustified is in how atheists often come to invoke scientific authority on their non-scientific philosophical conclusions like there being no point or no meaning to the universe as the only viable option when the scientific method and science never have had any way of addressing questions of meaning or God in the first place. Furthermore, he notes that since evolution made the brain and since the brain can handle both religion and science, there is no natural incompatibility between the concepts at the biological level.|$|E
