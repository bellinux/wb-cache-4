5|$|HMS Lord Nelson {{was laid}} down by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company at Jarrow on 18 May 1905 and {{launched}} on 4 September 1906. Her completion was greatly delayed by the diversion of her 12-inch (305mm) guns and turrets to expedite completion of , {{and she was not}} fully completed until October 1908. Although she was not the last pre-dreadnought laid down for the Royal Navy, she <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>one</b> commissioned.|$|E

They also find that Fiore's wife Anita keeps a collection of origami animals made by her first husband—Charlie Morris. Anita tells the agents that Fiore hasn't returned home from the previous night; meanwhile, the agents find that pages are missing from the file on Morris' murder, and Fiore <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>one</b> to have checked the file out.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} play of the drive, Clark was sacked by Kenny Smith for a six-yard loss. Pegues ran for one yard, then ran for 12yards on third down. The Hokies punted after going three and out, but the ball bounced off Alabama kick {{returner}} Alvin Richard. The loose ball was recovered by Virginia Tech's Cory Bird, and the Hokies' offense returned to the field with 35 seconds remaining in the quarter. From the Alabama 19-yard line, Clark scrambled for a one-yard gain. The play <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>one</b> of the third quarter, which ended with Virginia Tech leading, 247.|$|E

5|$|Patrick {{gets on the}} bus to go {{home but}} accidentally leaves SpongeBob behind. After several {{unsuccessful}} attempts {{to get on the}} bus, SpongeBob heads to a bus station and waits in a very long line. By the time he reaches the front, he finds out that the next bus leaves in 5 seconds; he misses it, then learns that it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>one</b> and he is stuck there until morning. He becomes frightened by a raspberry sound coming from off in the distance, and he dashes back to the cliff in terror. Finally, the raspberry sound's maker is revealed to be a friendly-looking anglerfish creature, who has retrieved SpongeBob's glove balloon. The creature blows up the balloon and ties it to SpongeBob's wrist, which allows him to rise up the cliff and float back to Bikini Bottom. The episode ends with Patrick {{on his way back to}} Rock Bottom, thinking SpongeBob is still there.|$|E
5|$|Susan and David {{defy the}} group and go check on Mr. Griffin. The two find him dead {{as a result of}} {{coronary}} arrest after being unable to take his medication for angina. Mark convinces {{the rest of the group}} to cover up the death. He instructs Susan, who <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>one</b> known to the police to see Mr. Griffin, to tell them Mr. Griffin kept looking at his watch during the conference and left with a pretty woman. Jeff, Mark, and David bury the body in the mountains. Betsy and David also drive Mr. Griffin's car to the airport, but the officer who gave Betsy a ticket sees her there. Worried that the officer might later identify the car as Mr. Griffin's, Jeff and Betsy move the car into Jeff's garage so he can repaint it before they hide it elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Deep Purple {{arrived in}} California on 15 October 1968 and their first public {{appearance}} on American soil was at The Dating Game TV show on ABC on 17 October. They {{were the first}} rock band to perform on the show, where Jon Lord {{was one of the}} contestants. The next two days the band played live in the US {{for the first time as}} supporting act of Cream in their Goodbye tour. The concerts were held at the Inglewood Forum near Los Angeles, California, in front of more than 16,000 people every night. Recordings of those live shows were issued in 2002 as Inglewood – Live in California. The next gig at San Diego <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>one</b> supporting Cream, whose management apparently did not appreciate the cheerful reaction of the audience to Deep Purple and dropped them. After a week of forced stop, their American manager succeeded in setting up a tour which included the San Francisco International Pop Festival and venues on the West Coast. This opportunity was very useful for the young musicians, who as headliners could lengthen their live shows up to 90 minutes and gained much needed experience on the road. This was particularly true for Blackmore, who developed and extended his guitar solos, incorporating more improvisations.|$|E

25|$|The {{show was}} {{a number of times}} said to have come to its end, only to reappear. For example, in 1984, TV Times {{reported}} that series 5 would be the last. In 1985, it again seemed as if that the current series <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>one,</b> and it was off-air (bar repeats) for three years, to reappear in 1988. This series appeared to be the last as Dennis Waterman announced his departure {{at the end of its}} run. However, after a two-and-a-half-year break, the show was back again for a further two-and-a-half-year run, which ended with the tenth series in 1994.|$|E
25|$|The 1938 {{effort to}} remove the {{building}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>one</b> for 30 years. Various reasons have been suggested for why the Old Post Office Building survived. A common claim is that the federal government, fighting the Great Depression, simply {{did not have the}} money. Press reports at the time, however, noted that voters would have punished congressmen who tore down a perfectly good building. Architectural historians have also argued that President Franklin D. Roosevelt (who took office in March 1933, five years into the Federal Triangle's construction) was not interested in completing the expensive complex of white marble office buildings or making the Federal Triangle architecturally harmonious.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{the presidential}} term of 1973–1977 is notable {{for being the}} only one in American history in which both the {{original}} President and Vice President fail to complete the term. Vice President Spiro Agnew, who resigned {{less than a year after}} the election over allegations that he had accepted bribes as Governor of Maryland, was replaced by Gerald Ford under the terms of the 25th Amendment, while Nixon would resign due to the Watergate Scandal in August 1974. Ultimately, the 1973–77 term would see two different Presidents and three different Vice Presidents. , the 1972 election <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>one</b> where the winning candidate did not serve his full term of office.|$|E
