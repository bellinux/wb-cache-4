40|$|Hypodermosis, {{caused by}} warble fly Przhevalskiana silenus (Order: Diptera, Family: Oestridae), is an endemic {{parasitic}} infestation of goats in Pakistan. The larvae of this fly, obligatory parasite of their hosts, are economically very important causing severe losses to leather industry. This infestation is {{also responsible for}} growth retardation, carcass depreciation and production losses in milk and meat. Keeping in view {{the importance of this}} infestation, studies were designed on serodiagnosis, epidemiology and economic importance of hypodermosis in goats in northern uplands of Balochistan, Pakistan, with the objectives to diagnose <b>warble</b> <b>fly</b> <b>infestation</b> at early stages through serology for better control and eradication strategies, to study different epidemiological factors (age, sex, breed, temperature, humidity and rain fall) contributing goat <b>warble</b> <b>fly</b> <b>infestation,</b> to compare seroprevalence over the prevalence based on clinical examination and to study the economic importance of hypodermosis in the study area. The duration of the study was one year (April 2011 to March 2012) and the most prevalent breed of goat i. e. khurasani breed in uplands of Balochistan was involved in the study which was compared with the non-descriptive breed of goat. In the first experiment, a total of 1440 sera samples were processed by commercial ELISA kit (IDEXX hypodermosis serum antibody test) method. The infestation was detected in May (summer) while the infestation is usually detected in the months of October until February (winter) by clinical palpation method when warbles appear {{on the backs of the}} animals. ELISA based seroprevalence showed the highest mean percentage (48. 45 % Â± 16. 14) of goat hypodermosis. In the second experiment on epidemiology, the mean percentage was 15. 94 % Â± 5. 65 by clinical palpation method in the field. In the slaughter house and skin market studies, the mean percentages were 9. 07 % Â± 3. 90 and 7. 16 % Â± 3. 39, respectively, while the mean intensity was 16. 19 Â± 3. 04 holes per skin. Analysis of data by Pearson Chi-square test (Ã· 2), revealed highly significant differences (P 2 years of age groups whereas no significant difference (P< 0. 05) was observed sex-wise and breed-wise. The life cycle of warble fly in naturally infested goats was studied from April 2011 to March 2012. First instars larvae (L 1) were observed in subcutaneous tissues from mid of May to mid of July in slaughter houses of the study areas, second instars larvae (L 2) from mid of July to November and third instars larvae (L 3) were palpated in the field animals from December until the end of February. The pupal period was observed in early spring in the months from March to mid April while the adult fly activity season (Oviposition period) was observed in early summer from mid April to mid May. In the third experiment, the overall loss due to skin damages by <b>warble</b> <b>fly</b> <b>infestation</b> was calculated as Pak. Rupees 7578625. 49 (Pak.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{a review of the}} {{development}} of economically significant diseases of cattle within the territory of the former German Democratic Republic from 1946 to 1989. The available literature was screened and evaluated according to certain time periods. These time periods were based on the development of GDR-agriculture, which is briefly summarized. The state of animal health in live stock cattle changed significantly {{during the course of the}} study period. In the beginning epidemics and venereal diseases were the most important cattle diseases, whereas towards the end, non-infectious diseases, particularly nutritional disorders, and multifactorial infectious diseases took this place. Bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis, trichomoniasis, vibriosis and <b>warble</b> <b>fly</b> <b>infestation</b> were eradicated in the GDR from 1946 to 1989. A significant relationship can be established between the development of agriculture and the main foci of diseases. Freestall housing, the foundation of large-scale live stock enterprises and industrialized cattle production caused specific animal health problems. Control of economically significant cattle diseases in the GDR was performed by an extensive public veterinary service under central government guidance and coordination. The efficiency of this system was high, especially in controlling epidemics, but it was restricted to the limited economic capacities of the GDR. The control of animal epidemics and parasitoses was mainly performed in an administrative manner. Area sanitation programmes were successfully applied for tuberculosis, brucellosis, <b>warble</b> <b>fly</b> <b>infestation,</b> mastitis agalactiae and leucosis. It was shown, that set-backs in controlling animal epidemics were often caused by uncertainties in diagnostic measures.

40|$|Abstract. Among the {{arthropods}} causing diseases to animals, myiasis {{causes a}} broad range of infestations depending on the location of larvae and its developmental stages on the body of the host. These infestations reduce host physiological functions, destroy host tissues and cause significant economic losses to livestock worldwide. This study was conducted to find out the pathological changes of goats tissue infested with Przhevalskiana silenus. Goat <b>warble</b> <b>fly</b> <b>infestation</b> (GWFI), improperly named goat hypodermosis, is a myiasis caused by larvae of P. silenus. Out of 16, 250 goats examined in the slaughter house in the studied area, 433 (2. 67 %) were infested with warble fly. The minimum and maximum rate of infectivity was 7 and 84 with an average of 32. 4 warbles per animal. Histopathological examinations were carried out on the infested subcutaneous tissues. Infiltration of the mononuclear cell types, tissue necrosis, pyogranulomatous reaction, hyalinization, mineralization, muscle fragmentation, oedema, and hyperemia of arterioles and capillaries were the most important microscopic findings associated with different developmental stages of P. silenus instars in the goats.

40|$|The {{prophylactic}} {{efficacy of}} microdoses of injectable and pour-on ivermectin formulations against larval stages of Przhevalskiana silenus was assessed in naturally infected goats {{in the region}} of Calabria (southern Italy). Sixty-eight goats from two goat farms were divided into five groups: one group remained untreated, while the other four groups were treated with microdoses of ivermectin (5 and 10 microg/kg injectable formulation and 10 and 20 microg/kg pour-on formulation). The microdoses of ivermectin were fully effective in the treatment of goat <b>warble</b> <b>fly</b> <b>infestation</b> (GWFI) as no larvae emerged from the warbles in the treated groups, while all the larvae emerged in the control groups. Irrespective of the type of formulation used, the difference between the treated groups and the control group was statistically significant (P< 0. 001). By contrast, no statistical {{differences were found between the}} goats treated with the injectable formulation and those receiving the pour-on applications, and between the two doses of the injectable and pour-on formulations used. Given the plasma concentrations it attains at its lowest dose (0. 052 - 0. 042 ng/ml for the injectable formulation and 0. 030 ng/ml for the pour-on) the injectable formulation seems to offer the most reliable route for the administration of ivermectin microdoses and it is acceptable for milk consumption. The introduction of ivermectin in the early eighties and the use of microdoses in some cases have made it possible to control cattle hypodermosis in large areas of Europe. As with cattle hypodermosis, the administration of ivermectin microdoses in goats is particularly interesting because of the low costs involved and the low levels of residues found in goat milk; it may thus constitute the basis for GWFI control campaigns in areas where the disease is prevalent...|$|E

In natural populations, Corsican blue tit chicks are exposed to the highest levels of blood-sucking ectoparasitic blow flies Protocalliphora spp. reported in Europe. These ectoparasites can have severe negative effects on chick development and survival probabilities, especially when food constraints are elevated. Here we investigated in several natural Corsican blue tit populations the hypothesis that aromatic plants brought to the nest have anti-blow fly effects during the chick-rearing stage.
