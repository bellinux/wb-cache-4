Since 1925 there have been six series printed, with the design remaining the same until 1980, though the colour and watermarks have changed. The Irish word pingin, for penny, is used in both £.s.d and decimal currency, but because it has the same meaning in each, the value on the label does not indicate whether the label was issued before or after decimalisation. Hence, identifying the issue of a label requires further information: if collectors knows the date of use, the existence of a watermark and if so which type, and the specific colour, identification <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier.</b> For example, the 3d value was blue between 1940 and 1969, and stone colour from 1971 until 1980; it changed from a watermarked to a non-watermark paper in 1978. Additionally, the 1, 5 and 8 pence values are seen in two different colours depending on the issue, while the d, 1d, 2d and 6d are seen with both watermark varieties. Except for the sixth issue, which has the word Éire in the design, there is no explicit country identity on any of the others. The first four series use only Irish words.|$|E

25|$|Testosterone {{increases}} {{body weight}} (and increases appetite). The form that this weight gain will take depends on {{diet and exercise}} as well as genetic factors. Since testosterone has anabolic effects, gain of lean muscle mass <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> than it previously was for transgender men. Moderate amounts of exercise will cause greater gains and will ameliorate some of the adverse effects of testosterone.|$|E
25|$|Temperature, pressure, and the {{concentration}} of the oxidizer also influences flammability limits. Higher temperature or pressure, as well as higher concentration of the oxidizer (primarily oxygen in air), results in lower LFL and higher UFL, hence the gas mixture <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> to explode. The effect of pressure is very small at pressures below 10 millibar and difficult to predict, since it has only been studied in internal combustion engines with a turbocharger.|$|E

25|$|It is safest to longe in an {{enclosed}} area. If the horse escapes, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> to catch, and {{an enclosed}} area {{will make him}} easier to control on the longe. Ideally, a 60 to 70-foot (20–25 m) round pen is used. However, the corner of any enclosed arena or small field may also be used. For safety, it is best {{if there is no}} one riding in the longeing area.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{challenges}} in thermal therapy is delivering the appropriate amount of heat to the correct part of the patient's body. A great deal of current research focuses on precisely positioning heat delivery devices (catheters, microwave, and ultrasound applicators, etc.) using ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging, {{as well as of}} developing new types of nanoparticles that make them particularly efficient absorbers while offering little or no concerns about toxicity to the circulation system. Clinicians also hope to use advanced imaging techniques to monitor heat treatments in real time—heat-induced changes in tissue are sometimes perceptible using these imaging instruments. In magnetic hyperthermia or magnetic fluid hyperthermia method, it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> to control temperature distribution by controlling the velocity of ferrofluid injection and size of magnetic nanoparticles.|$|E

500|$|When {{production}} restarted in 2005, {{there was}} a more budget-conscious approach to filming The Fountain, whose original budget was mostly intended for visual effects. Libatique reflected, [...] "Visual effects [...] {{a lot of the}} budget in the original conception. The popcorn moments were in there to justify the budget and bring target audiences into the theater. Ultimately, I think the streamlining of the film helped us tell the story more effectively. It's been stripped down to the core, to what it's really about: a search for immortality, when the truth of life is mortality. I {{think at the end of}} the day, the theme of the film <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> to feel." ...|$|E
500|$|Faust {{noted the}} cynicism about the brony fandom, and commented that in {{considering}} the idea of grown men watching a show for little girls, [...] "They think there's something wrong with that, something devious about it"; she noted that it was [...] "upsetting to me that people jump to those conclusions". Faust believes that her future animated shows aimed at girls <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> to sell considering the male adult fandom of Friendship Is Magic, and that that type of programming is not as great a risk as is perceived. After Hasbro issued a cease and desist to the Fighting Is Magic project {{over the use of}} copyrighted and trademarked characters, Faust offered to provide the developers with original character arts to allow them to continue to develop the game without copyright issues.|$|E

500|$|Potter {{completed}} {{the text of}} Timmy Tiptoes but decided it was too long. She was also uncertain exactly how to put the bird calls into print. She revised the text, and wrote publisher Harold Warne: [...] "I have compressed {{the words in the}} earlier pages, but it seems unavoidable to have a good deal of nuts. The songs of the little birds <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> to judge as to spelling when one sees it in type." [...] The illustrations presented another problem. For her earlier productions, Potter was able to observe the species concerned in the wild, and kept specimens at home as pets and models. For Timmy Tiptoes however, she was unable to do so. Instead, she relied on specimens in the London Zoological Gardens as models, and checked photographs in reference books including one from the firm of taxidermist Rowland Ward. [...] "The book obtained from Rowland Ward will be very useful," [...] she wrote.|$|E
