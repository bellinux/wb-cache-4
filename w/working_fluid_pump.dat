40|$|The use of efficient, {{innovative}} and cost effective renewable energy systems {{in order to}} produce potable water seems to be a very promising research objective for scientists, engineers and economists, since the choice of the appropriate technologies is combined with the fact that these systems should be economically feasible. This paper presents a general concept of designing a desalination system which uses a solar collectors' field to drive a reverse osmosis process through an Organic Rankine Cycle. The auxiliary equipment power demand (i. e. cooling pump, collectors' circulator and <b>working</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>pump)</b> is satisfied by a hybrid system based on a PV generator. An inverter is used to convert the DC to AC current while a battery array is also integrated into the system as energy storage. In order to make a complete study of the system, the pumping loads through the sea and to the area's municipal water network have been taken into consideration. The objective of the current work is to study an autonomous desalination system that can be applied to several Greek islands where two problems are to be solved at the same time: the lack of potable water and the absence of electrical grid. The investigation of the financial conditions for the realization of a feasible project of an integrated hybrid desalination system (including Solar Thermal and PV technology) is finally presented.

Flue gas in cement plant can be utilized as alternative power generation. With the 200 - 300 oC temperature output range of flue gas from suspension preheater and air quenching cooler (AQC) in cement plant, organic rankine cycle (ORC) can be suitable option for alternative power generation. ORC is development of rankine cycle, the different is the working fluid in ORC using refrigerant.

40|$|SummaryIn this study, the Trilateral Flash Cycle (TFC) and the Partially Evaporating Cycle (PEC) {{have been}} {{analyzed}} and {{compared to the}} Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) for power production from low temperature heat sources. This study {{is a continuation of}} the work done in my project thesis fall 2013. The ORC is a well-known technology that is in use in several plants today. The TFC and PEC on the other hand are still in a state of technical development. The biggest challenge for the TFC and PEC is the required two-phase expansion. Lately, two-phase expanders with high efficiencies have been developed, which makes the TFC and PEC economically interesting. Currently, only a few studies on the TFC and PEC can be found, {{and most of them are}} theoretical considerations. All of these studies finds the TFC promising for low temperature heat sources, which was also the findings of my project thesis. The PEC is found to be promising for smaller systems where the <b>working</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>pump</b> efficiency is low. The TFCs main difference from the ORC is that the heating process ends at the boiling point of the working fluid, i. e. there is no evaporation and superheating. This leads to a better temperature match between the working fluid and the heat source, such that more heat can be transferred to the working fluid. Power is produced in a two-phase expander after the heating process. The cost pr. kWh for TFC systems have been estimated to be lower than for ORC systems due to the elimination of the evaporator, separator drum, gear box, lube oil system and the fact that simpler heat exchangers can be used. In the PEC, the working fluid is allowed to be partially evaporated during the heating process. This is done in an attempt to combine the advantages of the TFC and the ORC. The ORC, TFC and PEC have been simulated in a Microsoft Excel calculation tool, using Visual Basic for Applications. The simulations include detailed heat exchanger models to calculate heat transfer coefficients and pressure losses, and two-phase expander efficiency models for the TFC and PEC. The three cycles have been simulated and optimized for maximum net power production for three cases using different heat source temperatures. Air with a mass flow of 10 kg/s and temperatures of 100, 150 and 200 &# 176;C are used for Case I, Case II and Case III respectively. Water at 20 &# 176;C is used as the heat sink. The three cases are simulated with eight different working fluids, R 123, R 134 a, R 245 fa, R 1234 ze(E), butane, pentane, isopentane and propane with maximum heat exchanger areas of 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500 and 4000 m 2. Different performance parameters are calculated and used to compare the performance of the ORC, TFC and PEC, and the different working fluids. The results show that the TFC has the lowest power production for all cases, and the largest estimated system size. Both the total heat exchanger area and expander outlet volume flow are generally higher for the TFC systems, especially for the lower heat source temperature cases. For the 100 &# 176;C and 150 &# 176;C cases the power production for the TFC and ORC is in the same range. Since TFC systems are estimated to have a lower cost than ORC systems, they can be suitable for systems with heat sources in this range when system size is not a critical factor. The PEC does not show any advantage over the ORC for the cases analyzed here. This study shows less promising results for the TFC than my project thesis and other published studies. This is mainly due to the variable two-phase expander efficiency used here, and that none of the other studies considers pressure losses in the system or calculation of heat transfer coefficients for each working fluid. A scientific paper on the main results from the study before the simulation of the PEC and inclusion of the heat exchanger models is given in Appendix C. This paper has been submitted to the journal Energy. A scientific paper on the final results of the study is given in Appendix D. This paper has been submitted to the Gustav Lorentzen Conference. </p...|$|E

The presence of <b>fluid</b> <b>pumps</b> in the medical field has gained momentum and has become an essential factor considering handling of life saving drugs and fluidic transport within the body. The need for a miniaturized flow pump based on size, application and capacity has driven the evolution from robust size pumps to MEMS based pumps.

40|$|Vapor {{compression}} heat <b>pumps</b> which employ <b>working</b> <b>fluid</b> mixtures {{rather than}} pure substances offer significant advantages leading to larger temperature lifts at low pressure ratios or to completely new applications. The main feature of such cycles {{is the fact}} that the <b>working</b> <b>fluid</b> mixture does not evaporate completely in the evaporator. The remaining liquid phase is then recirculated by means of a liquid pump into the condenser. This yields significant improvements compared to conventional systems: -Adjustable gliding temperature intervals in desorber and absorber by merely adjusting the flow rate through the liquid pump and/or ?Dramatically reducing pressure ratios (to typically 45 % of the one for a single <b>working</b> <b>fluid</b> heat <b>pump)</b> for a given temperature lift due to staging of the solution circuit. The latter is accomplished when a two-stage version of this cycle is used.

One advantage of this design is that it can be easily and precisely fabricated using microelectromechanical system (MEMS) processing techniques: this has allowed us to integrate a micropump and a microchannel into a single device. Moreover, the pressure generated by the pump is induced solely by electrochemical reactions; since mechanical components such as gears are not required, this helps reduce the noise generated by the device...|$|R

The capillary performance of these porous copper fiber sintered sheets were analyzed and discussed. The influence of the surface morphology, filling ratio, and <b>working</b> <b>fluid</b> on the thermal resistance, evaporator wall temperature, and start-up time of the loop heat pipes were investigated. The {{results showed that the}} capillary <b>pumping</b> amount of <b>working</b> <b>fluid</b> for both smooth and rough porous copper fiber sintered sheets initially increases rapidly, and then gradually attains a stable state. The curve of the capillary <b>pumping</b> amount of <b>working</b> <b>fluid</b> can be described as a function that increases exponentially over time. When rough porous copper fiber sintered sheets are used as wicks and deionized water is used as the <b>working</b> <b>fluid,</b> the capillary <b>pumping</b> amount is maximized.

This paper conducts a review of how to optimize the {{concentrated solar power}} plant by increasing the stored energy capacity or by stabilizing the absorptance and emittance in the solar absorber. The additional stages in the CSP may increase thermal efficiency. The stages consist of two oriented solar absorber to create superheated steam fed to the steam turbine and one regenerator to optimally regenerate heat for <b>working</b> <b>fluid</b> before <b>pumped</b> to solar absorber. A suitable treatment for superheated steam from solar absorber can optimally supply the turbine with a continually stable steam.

In-plane heat flux was provided by a high-power ceramic heater, while <b>working</b> <b>fluid</b> was <b>pumped</b> through the system using a servo-controlled syringe pump. 	Temperature data was collected primarily using infrared thermal imaging, and detailed analysis was conducted to estimate convective heat losses from external surfaces and calculate the effective in-plane thermal conductivity. The veracity of this analysis was verified experimentally by analyzing the well-established case of pure conduction and correctly predicting the intrinsic solid conductivity of silicon (k ~ 130 W/m-K) over a wide range of input heat fluxes and surface temperatures. 	Several distinct performance regimes were observed as the input flux was increased and more vigorous vaporization occurred. Most significantly, subsequent to the onset of stable vaporization, the effective thermal conductivity of a device typically increased by a factor of more than ten (k ~ 1000 - 2000 W/m-K). This conductivity was easily maintained and extremely insensitive to further increases in flux. The highest effective thermal conductivities were observed just prior to dryout. Single data point spikes as well as short (3 - 5 second) intervals of 10, 000 - 20, 000 W/m-K were regularly observed. 		Peripheral experimental studies related to the author's previous work on self-nucleating surfaces were performed, as was a brief study on the hermetic sealing of microfluidic devices...|$|R

To evaluate <b>working</b> <b>fluid</b> refrigeration performance and the relationships between COPc and PR, CRPR is hence defined as the ratio of COPc to PR, which is an indicator of <b>working</b> <b>fluid</b> refrigeration performance.
