Our training for Iraqi security forces includes instruction on the proper observance of human rights. Human rights training is also {{a very important part of}} our and other international donors' civilian capacity-building efforts in Iraq. And the US embassy in Baghdad has raised, and will continue to raise, the issue with senior officials from the government of Iraq, and has urged them to respond appropriately to all credible reports of violence against gay and lesbian Iraqis.|$|E

25|$|Hierocles {{was among}} the campaigners for a {{stronger}} policy against Christians present at Diocletian's court through the early 4th century. The campaigners' aims were as realized in February 303 with the edicts of the Great Persecution, which expelled Christians from government service, deprived them of normal legal rights, and left them open to imprisonment and execution {{if they did not}} comply with traditional religious rites. Hierocles was avid enforcer of these edicts in his function as praeses of Bithynia, and again while serving as praefectus Aegypti during the late 300s or early 310s. It is largely through incidental notes in the Christian author Lactantius' On the Deaths of the Persecutors and Divine Institutes and Eusebius of Caesarea's On the Martyrs of Palestine and Against Hierocles that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> of his activities. Inscriptions at Palmyra preserve the details of his early career.|$|E

500|$|Bell and Zbyszewski worked {{together}} on the characters' storyline for the third season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., preparing them to move over to the spin-off, with Bell explaining that it would set up Most Wanted by defining exactly who the characters are, such as Hunter and his lack of loyalty to S.H.I.E.L.D. and to ideologies—"nothing specific about the show, it's just who Hunter is." [...] In March 2016, Bell stated that while Hunter and Morse are [...] "on S.H.I.E.L.D., {{we want to take}} advantage of who they are, and give the audience as much of their relationship with one another, and with other people, as possible. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> that there is a potential imminent end, and so they won't be neglected." ...|$|E

We should not focus on anything other than the thing that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> doing. One of the key methods that Hanh presents is learning to <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> of breathing.|$|R

500|$|However, a {{pilot for}} the spinoff was ordered in August 2015, with the series titled Marvel's Most Wanted. Bell and fellow Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. {{executive}} producer Paul Zbyszewski developed the series, {{while working on}} Hunter and Morse's storyline for season three, preparing them to move over to the spin-off. Bell explained that it would set up Most Wanted by defining exactly who the characters are, such as Hunter and his lack of loyalty to S.H.I.E.L.D. and to ideologies—"nothing specific about the show, it's just who Hunter is"—and that while the characters are [...] "on S.H.I.E.L.D., {{we want to take}} advantage of who they are, and give the audience as much of their relationship with one another, and with other people, as possible. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> that there is a potential imminent end, and so they won't be neglected." ...|$|E

The Uniformed Firefighters Association initially supported it, but withdrew when the connection to the Church of Scientology was revealed. Firefighter Union President Patrick Bahnken said his members' lives had benefited from the program, {{and that it had}} involved no religious rhetoric. Deputy Fire Commissioner Frank Gribbon of the FDNY told The New York Times, [...] "while <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> some members of the department have availed themselves of the program, we in no way endorse it." [...] Officials at the department raised concerns that firefighters were giving up existing medications in order to take part.

500|$|In France {{the action}} was greeted with celebration, and it became the only naval battle commemorated on the Arc de Triomphe. The British {{response}} was despondent, although all four captains were subsequently cleared and praised at their courts-martial inquiring into {{the loss of their}} ships. The only criticism was of Willoughby, who was accused of giving a misleading signal in indicating that the French were of inferior force on 22 August. Contemporary historian William James described British reaction to the battle as [...] "that the noble behaviour of her officers and crew threw such a halo of glory around the defeat at Grand Port, that, in public opinion at least, the loss of four frigates was scarcely considered a misfortune." [...] However, he also notes that [...] "No case of which <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> more deeply affects the character of the Royal Navy than the defeat it sustained at Grand Port." [...] On 30 December 1899, a monument was erected at the harbour of Grand Port in the memory of the British and French sailors who were killed in the engagement.|$|E

500|$|Richard Franklin {{contends that}} on {{occasion}} surrealist writing obscures meaning, but in [...] Asturias avoids this flaw. His combination of rationalism with [...] "a world of forms" [...] creates [...] "an imagery which reveals a deeper reality, {{one which is}} more {{deeply rooted in the}} human psyche". As such, Asturias's surrealist style highlights the modern disintegration of long-standing belief systems. Literary scholar Gabriele Eckart gives as an excellent example of Asturias's surrealist style his portrayal of The Zany's psychic processes in which [...] "language sometimes breaks apart into incomprehensible sounds". This allows Asturias to present the real and imaginary, as well as the communicable and incommunicable, as non-contradictory. Himelblau also highlights how [...] projects [...] "reality in relative, fluid termsthat is it allows its characters to disclose the temporal setting of the novel's fictional events". In this regard, then, Himelblau notes that [...] "is also, as far as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware,</b> the first novel in Spanish America that seeks to render fictional reality of time as a function of point of view". The novel defies traditional narrative style by inserting numerous episodes that contribute little or nothing to the plot as the characters in these episodes often appear inconsistently. Instead of relaying the book's themes through characters, Asturias uses repetition of motifs and a mythical substructure to solidify the book's message.|$|E

2500|$|Consciousness is {{sometimes}} {{defined as the}} quality or state of being aware of an external object or something within oneself. It has been defined somewhat vaguely as: subjectivity, awareness, sentience, the ability to experience or to feel, wakefulness, having a sense of selfhood, and the executive control system of the mind. Despite the difficulty in definition, many philosophers {{believe that there is}} a broadly shared underlying intuition about what consciousness is.

Though it was noted by Radhika Coomaraswamy, the UN special representative on children and conflict, that the [...] "actual numbers of abductions is much higher, these are just the ones <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> of".

In January 2015, the White House responded to a petition signed by 34,000 Americans condemning organ harvesting from Falun Gong prisoners. The response noted that “China's leaders have announced a pledge to abolish the practice of taking human organs for transplant from executed prisoners, although <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> of continued reports of such practices.

The only way that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> of you can do that is to have tight configuration management and tight central control. So that is where a lot of the complaints came from.

2500|$|An {{incubation}} {{effect can}} be observed in TOT states, where the passage of time alone can influence the resolution of the state and result in successful recall. Also, the presence of a TOT state is a good predictor that the problem can be resolved correctly, although this has been shown to occur more frequently with older-young-adults than young-adults or seniors. This is evidence for both the metacognitive perspective as well as the psycholinguistic perspective. [...] It demonstrates the devotion of resources to searching memory, a source of cumulative information, for the desired correct information, and it also shows that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> of what information we know or do not know. This is why the current debate between the psycholinguistic view of TOTs as retrieval failure and the metacognitive view of TOTs as a tool for learning continues.|$|E
