500|$|Strawberry Field was {{the name}} of a Salvation Army children's home just around the corner from Lennon's {{childhood}} home in Woolton, a suburb of Liverpool. Lennon and his childhood friends Pete Shotton, Nigel Walley and Ivan Vaughan used to play in the wooded garden behind the home. One of Lennon's childhood treats was the garden party held each summer in Calderstones Park, near the home, where a Salvation Army band played. Lennon's aunt Mimi Smith recalled: [...] "As soon as <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the Salvation Army band starting, John would jump up and down shouting, 'Mimi, come on. We're going to be late.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|.....sometimes without warning, a heavy {{thunderstorm}} high on {{the mountain}} changed it into a roaring, tearing monster. [...] At night, after a storm, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the giant rocks being pushed and crushed together by its force. [...] Trees, loosened by the flood, crashed into the water to be swept downstream.|$|E
2500|$|He also {{explained}} {{the benefits of}} recording that way, [...] "In the past, we've always done one instrument {{at a time and}} it takes twice as long, and half the members of the band are gone once their parts are done. [...] This way we all got to enjoy the entire process together and every two days <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> a rough mix of what that specific track sounded like." ...|$|E
60|$|The roar increased, and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> {{distinctly}} <b>hear</b> the shouting.|$|R
6000|$|... "They've gone!" [...] the man replied, and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> now <b>hear</b> {{his words}} more {{distinctly}} {{because he was}} coming nearer each instant.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who made {{believe to}} be so meek [...] That <b>we</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>hear</b> him speak, [...] Yet turned out an Informing Sneak? [...] Old Cheeseman." ...|$|R
2500|$|Towards {{the evening}} we bade them adieu and took horse, being {{resolved}} that, {{instead of the}} race which fails us, {{we would go to}} Epsom When we come there <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> of no lodging, the town so full, but which was better, I went towards Ashsted, and there we got a lodging in a little hole we could not stand upright in While supper was getting I walked up and down behind my cosen [...] Pepys's house that was, which I find comes little short of what I took it to be when I was a little boy.|$|E
2500|$|Caillat, in contrast, cites Fleetwood as [...] "still one of {{the most}} amazing drummers I've ever met. He had his rack of tom drums {{arranged}} back to front. Most drummers place them from high to low (in pitch) from their left to right, but Mick chose to place his mid, high, low. I think perhaps this helped him develop his unique style. He hit his drums very hard, except for his kick drum. For some reason, when he played his high hat, it distracted him. He would keep perfect beat with his kick, but he played it so softly that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> his mouth noises through his kick mic." ...|$|E
2500|$|An American {{break-out}} {{was achieved}} with Operation Cobra and the encirclement of German {{forces in the}} Falaise pocket {{at the cost of}} British losses with the diversionary Operation Goodwood. On the early morning of 18 July 1944, Operation Goodwood began with British heavy bombers beginning carpet bombing attacks that further devastated what was left of Caen and the surrounding countryside. A British tank crewman from the Guards Armoured Division later recalled: [...] "At 0500 hours a distant thunder in the air brought all the sleepy-eyed tank crews out of their blankets. 1,000 Lancasters were flying from the sea in groups of three or four at [...] Ahead of them the pathfinders were scattering their flares and before long the first bombs were dropping". A German tankman from the 21st Panzer Division at the receiving end of this bombardment remembered: [...] "We saw little dots detach themselves from the planes, so many of them that the crazy thought occurred to us: are those leaflets?...Among the thunder of the explosions, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the wounded scream and the insane howling of men who had [...] driven mad". The British bombing had badly smashed the German front-line units; e.g. tanks were thrown up on the roofs of French farmhouses. Initially, the three British armoured divisions assigned to lead the offensive, the 7th, 11th and the Guards, made rapid progress and were soon approaching the Borguebus ridge, which dominated the landscape south of Caen by noon.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What are you whining about?' Fred began, {{and then}} he broke off {{suddenly}} and listened. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> both <b>hear</b> the man's footsteps as he moved about.|$|R
60|$|There {{was another}} {{daughter}} I had, which, {{with all our}} inquiries, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> of, high nor low, for several years after the first. But I return to my own story.|$|R
60|$|That {{night the}} empty {{corridors}} Were full of forms of Fear, And {{up and down}} the iron town Stole feet <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear,</b> And through the bars that hide the stars White faces seemed to peer.|$|R
60|$|Hans hissed {{long and}} venomously. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the great beast quaking in his cage.|$|E
60|$|The lights {{switched}} off, and {{the darkness}} stunned like an avalanche. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> Dragomiroff's teeth on the glass edge.|$|E
60|$|And {{from afar}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the {{soldiers}} singing 'Two Lovely Black Eyes,' {{as they drove}} the remnant of the rioters within doors.|$|E
6000|$|That {{night the}} empty {{corridors}} [...] Were full of forms of Fear, [...] And {{up and down}} the iron town [...] Stole feet <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear,</b> [...] And through the bars that hide the stars [...] White faces seemed to peer.|$|R
60|$|We both sat quite silent, so that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} <b>hear</b> {{each other}} breathing. Everything seemed deadly still, but once something near us, some plaster or broken brickwork, slid {{down with a}} rumbling sound. Outside and very near was an intermittent, metallic rattle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Suzanne with mad glee, [...] "the best <b>we</b> <b>could</b> {{possibly}} <b>hear.</b> My Lord Hastings {{came to see}} maman {{early this}} morning. He said that all is now well with dear papa, and we may safely expect him here in England {{in less than four}} days." ...|$|R
60|$|Only maman {{continued}} to pray, and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> papa's rapid and stertorous breathing {{as he watched}} {{what was going on}} at that window above.|$|E
60|$|This {{illumination}} was {{but as the}} lightning's flash, {{and then}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the angry hum of the bullets as they swarmed above our heads.|$|E
6000|$|And {{from afar}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the {{soldiers}} singing [...] "Two Lovely Black Eyes," [...] {{as they drove}} the remnant of the rioters within doors.|$|E
60|$|Oh! now we knew, {{they were}} open also to another soul. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> see nothing save the Altar and the Effigy, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> only <b>hear</b> the slow chant {{of the priests}} and priestesses and the snake-like hiss of the rushing fires. Yet we knew that our hearts were as an open book to One who watched beneath the Mother's {{shadowing}} wings.|$|R
6000|$|Whenever {{we came to}} a {{full stop}} it was as if all nature ceased breathing, for <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> the lightest whisper amid the foliage, and when the flight had {{continued}} in such fashion for an hour or more, Simon Kenton said as we stood side by side listening intently for some token of the villains: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If he {{is still}} in New Zealand, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> telegraph, and <b>hear</b> directly. He {{did not know how}} long he should be there, for the ship had {{something}} to be done to it.' ...|$|R
60|$|My father {{opened the}} door and went out, and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> him striding down the gravel path, and we clung to one another and waited.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> the men {{working on}} the broken propellers, and from the {{port-hole}} we {{could see that the}} vessel was drifting lazily toward the south.|$|E
60|$|With the labored {{breathing}} of {{the horses}} filling our ears <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> no other sound. Dismounting, I went aside and turned my ear to the breeze.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is {{no reason}} she should speak to you in that way. I must ask you to excuse me, but <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not help <b>hearing,</b> she was so loud, and then I felt impelled to break in.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Does Dr. Watson live here?" [...] asked a clear {{but rather}} harsh voice. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> the servant's reply, {{but the door}} closed, and some one began to ascend the stairs. The {{footfall}} was an uncertain and shuffling one. A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he listened to it. It came slowly along the passage, {{and there was a}} feeble tap at the door.|$|R
60|$|A while passed, it {{may have}} been one minute or ten, when {{suddenly}} the priestess Papave, in obedience to some summons which <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear,</b> crept by me. I knew that it was she because her woman's garments touched me as she went. Another space of silence and of deep darkness, during which I heard Papave return, breathing in short, sobbing gasps like one who is very frightened.|$|R
6000|$|A faint shiver trembled {{through her}} wasted body. There was a pause. In the stillness <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> our breathings. Then she said, still in that low voice: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cap'n Silver! Don't know him. Who's he?" [...] {{cried the}} captain. And <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> him adding to himself, [...] "Cap'n, is it? My heart, and here's promotion!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} I mean--The Dowd and The Dancing Master. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> every word and we listened shamelessly--'specially the Hawley Boy. Polly, I quite love that woman!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good man! You've {{given me}} an idea. Vincent! Oh, Vincent!' He threw the General Communicator open so that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> all <b>hear,</b> {{and in a}} few minutes the chart-room filled with the rich, fruity voice of Leopold Vincent, who has purveyed all London her choicest amusements for the last thirty years. We {{answered}} with expectant grins, as though we were actually in the stalls of, say, the Combination on a first night.|$|R
60|$|We {{kept the}} valley of the glorified stream till the waters sank out of sight down the cliff side and <b>we</b> <b>could</b> but <b>hear</b> them calling to one another through the tangle of the trees. Where the {{woodlands}} were lovelier, the gorge deepest, and the colours of the young hornbeam most tender, they had clapped down two vile hostelries of wood and glass, and a village that lived by selling turned wood and glass inlay things to the tourist.|$|R
6000|$|In {{these days}} it is a {{delusion}} to suppose that you can speak confidentially in the English language, when French people are within hearing. One of the ladies asked Romayne, tenderly, if {{he was tired of}} her already. Another reminded him that it was raining heavily (as <b>we</b> <b>could</b> all <b>hear),</b> and suggested waiting until it cleared up. The hideous General waved his greasy hand {{in the direction of the}} card table, and said, [...] "The game is waiting for us." ...|$|R
