5|$|Contador faced {{repeated}} {{challenges from}} Riccardo Riccò and Danilo Di Luca in the race's final week. They <b>were</b> <b>separated</b> {{by less than}} a minute after stage 15, and though Di Luca would falter slightly in the Giro's second individual time trial, the time gap among the three of them was just 21 seconds heading in to the Giro's final mountain stage. Di Luca faltered further in that last mountain stage, losing almost five minutes and any chance to repeat as Giro champion, but Contador and Riccò finished together and <b>were</b> <b>separated</b> by only four seconds going into the Giro's final stage, another individual time trial. Contador's superior time trial skills provided the difference in the Giro's finale. Though he finished 11th on the stage, he gained almost two minutes over Riccò, winning the Giro overall without taking any individual stage.|$|E
