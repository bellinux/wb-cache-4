50|$|The keel of {{an iceberg}} or pack ice can extend {{far below the}} surface of the water. If this keel extends deep enough to make contact with the sea floor, it will scour the sea floor as the ice moves with the current. To protect the <b>wellhead</b> <b>equipment</b> from {{possible}} scouring, a glory hole is excavated into the sea floor. This excavation must be deep enough to allow adequate clearance between the top of the <b>wellhead</b> <b>equipment</b> and the surrounding sea floor. The resulting glory hole can be either open or cased. A cased glory hole utilizes steel casing as a retaining wall while an open glory hole is simply an excavation.|$|E

40|$|Theoretical {{calculations}} {{are presented}} {{to estimate the}} electrical generating capacity of the hot fluids discharged from individual geothermal wells using small <b>wellhead</b> generating <b>equipment</b> {{over a wide range}} of reservoir and operating conditions. The purpose is to appraise the possibility of employing slim holes (instead of conventional production-size wells) to power such generators for remote off-grid applications such as rural electrification in developing countries. Frequently, the generating capacity desired is less than one megawatt, and can be as low as 100 kilowatts; if slim holes can be usefully employed, overall project costs will be significantly reduced. This report presents the final results of the study. Both self-discharging wells and wells equipped with downhole pumps (either of the ''lineshaft'' or the ''submersible'' type) are examined. Several power plant designs are considered, including conventional single-flash backpressure and condensing steam turbines, binary plants, double-flash steam plants, and steam turbine/binary hybrid designs. Well inside diameters from 75 mm to 300 mm are considered; well depths vary from 300 to 1200 meters. Reservoir temperatures from 100 C to 240 C are examined, as are a variety of reservoir pressures and CO 2 contents and well productivity index values...|$|R
50|$|A {{glory hole}} {{in the context of}} the {{offshore}} petroleum industry is an excavation into the sea floor designed to protect the <b>wellhead</b> <b>equipment</b> installed at the surface of a petroleum well from icebergs or pack ice. An economically attractive alternative for exploiting offshore petroleum resources is a floating platform; however, ice can pose a serious hazard to this solution. While floating platforms can be built to withstand ice loading up to a design threshold, for the largest icebergs or the thickest pack ice the only sensible alternative is to move out of the way. Floating platforms can be disconnected from the wellheads in order to allow them to be moved away from threatening ice, but the <b>wellhead</b> <b>equipment</b> is fixed in place and hence vulnerable.|$|E

50|$|Shell {{plans to}} abandon the {{drilling}} areas immediately after the drilling or testing has taken place even if hydrocarbons are found, {{in accordance with the}} Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Drilling and Production Regulations. The drilled holes will be plugged with cement in order to prevent any leakage of subsurface compounds. These plugs are placed at varying depths in the well bore to separate and permanently isolate certain subsurface zones to prevent the escape of any subsurface fluids from the well.The drilled areas will be abandoned within seven to ten days of being exposed. As part of well abandonment, approval was sought to leave the wellhead in place. Where removal of the wellhead is required, the <b>wellhead</b> and associated <b>equipment</b> (casing) will be removed up to 1m below sea floor by using cutters.|$|R
40|$|The authors wish {{to thank}} the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC) for access to the data {{reviewed}} in this paper. We also wish to thank Mike Schmidt, formerly of the OCC, for having the foresight to initiate the OCC Complaint Database in 1992. A total of 16, 906 recent fluid releases were reported to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC) during the ten-year period from 1993 to 2003. Of these, 12, 863 were identified as exploration and production-related releases of oil or saltwater from identified geographic areas. The primary reported origins of oil and saltwater releases were leaks from lines, tanks, <b>wellheads,</b> surface <b>equipment</b> and pits. Important reported causes of fluid releases range from common overflows (tank, pit and dike), intentional dumping or other illegal activity, storms, fires or explosions, accidents (including the actions of livestock) and to occasional corrosion. Approximately 34 % of all recent oil or saltwater releases resulted in reported injury to environmental receptors (surface water, crops or livestock, soil, fish or wildlife). For the ten year period of record, 41 % of all E&P complaints to OCC involved the release of oil or saltwater. On an annual basis, complaints involving the release of fluids decreased from 65. 8 % in 1993 to 46. 1 % in 2002. Releases specifically identified as involving oil or saltwater comprised 76. 1 % of all fluid releases. Quantified releases of oil had a median volume of 10 barrels (bbl), while quantified releases of saltwater had a median volume of 40 bbl. For those releases in which the volume of both oil and saltwater were quantified, the volume of saltwater spilled was approximately 76 % of the total volume...|$|R

30|$|For example, the {{relative}} constancy of pressure in Mutnovskoe field {{is provided in}} the plant’s group separators; the steam–water mixture goes through {{the elements of the}} <b>wellhead</b> <b>equipment</b> and pipeline, sometimes more than 2  km long. When wells are being tested, the atmosphere is usually the environment with constant pressure. The measuring equipment is between the wellhead and the atmosphere. A change in wellhead pressure is executed via throttling on the wellhead valve. An analysis of stability of the system should be carried out taking into account additional resistance between the wellhead and the environment with constant pressure.|$|E
30|$|Sand {{production}} {{is one of}} the common problems in oil and gas production wells drilled in unconsolidated formations (Fattahpour et al. 2012). The abrasive flow of sand grains inside the wells and production lines leads to undesirable consequences including erosion of downhole or <b>wellhead</b> <b>equipment,</b> clogging of downhole equipment, subsidence of formation rock, walls destruction, reduction in reservoir recovery, maintenance cost, and in severe cases even death of the well (Ikporo and Sylvester 2015; Isehunwa and Olanrewaju 2010; Pedersen et al. 2017; Singh and van Petegem 2014). Sand production begins when the imposed in situ stresses on the formation exceeds the in situ formation strength (Gholami et al. 2016). On the contrary, sand consolidation usually happens when the natural bonds attach the grains by the cement materials in formations (Marfo et al. 2015).|$|E

40|$|A {{subsurface}} {{safety valve}} {{is used to}} shut in a well automatically, if the <b>wellhead</b> <b>equipment</b> or other surface production equipment fails. It is almost always installed as a vital component on the completion. In many industrial systems, scale formation causes significant problems, not when it precipitates in bulk solution but when it deposits on the surface. Surface scaling is a complex phenomenon where several processes such as heterogeneous crystallization or particle adhesion are inextricably linked and occur simultaneously. The sub-surface safety valve can accumulate carbonate, sulphate and sulphide scale. Even {{a thin layer of}} scale can impede the smooth operation of the valve and pose serious regulatory and safety risks. In this study twenty coatings from seven different natures have been tested. These coatings are Fluoropolymers, Composite (fluotopolymer matrix), Sol-gel nano-coating, Textured hydrophobic paint, Diamond Like Carbon (DLC), Polished Inconel and Nitro carburated Inconel. Whilst the anti-scaling capability of the coating is the key functional element, it is extremely important that the coating presents other important parameters such as hydrophobicity property, surface roughness, coating thickness and hardness, resistance to erosion, corrosion and temperature as well as coating adhesion. In this paper the controlling factors of anti-scaling coatings are discussed. Promising coatings with anti-scaling properties have been identified...|$|E
