5|$|In May 2011, the Ministry of Transport {{announced}} that SKA-Somalia had been contracted to manage {{operations at the}} re-opened Aden Adde International Airport {{over a period of}} ten years. Among its first initiatives, worth an estimated $6 million, SKA invested in new airport equipment and expanded support services by hiring, training and equipping 200 local workers to meet international airport standards. The company also assisted in comprehensive infrastructure renovations, restored a dependable supply of electricity, revamped the baggage handling facilities as well as the arrival and departure lounges, put into place electronic check-in systems, and firmed up on security and <b>work-flow.</b> Additionally, SKA connected the grounds' Somali Civil Aviation and Meteorological Agency (SCAMA) and immigration, customs, commercial airlines and Somali Police Force officials to the internet. By January 2013, the firm had introduced shuttle buses to ferry travelers to and from the passenger terminal.|$|E
5|$|This line — {{with many}} non-hamburger sandwiches, {{including}} chicken and fish — significantly expanded {{the breadth of}} the Burger King menu. The amount of new additions, several new sandwiches made with disparate ingredients was made possible due the design of Burger King's kitchen. The chain's kitchen is modeled around a more flexible concept that allows for a multiple <b>work-flow</b> operations where preparation stations can be re-tasked more easily. In comparison, McDonald's kitchen at the time was a more rigidly designed assembly line concept intended to quickly produce a more uniform product and was not easily adapted to new products. This more rigid system prevented McDonald's from broadening its menu to effectively competing with Burger King and other similar chains that were more flexible and were better positioned to expand their menu.|$|E
25|$|When color reproductions are made, {{the image}} is {{separated}} into its component colors by taking multiple photographs filtered for each color. One resultant film or plate represents each of the cyan, magenta, yellow, and black data. Color printing is a binary system, where ink is either present or not present, so all color separations to be printed must be translated into dots at some stage of the <b>work-flow.</b> Traditional line screens which are amplitude modulated had problems with moiré but were used until stochastic screening became available. A stochastic (or frequency modulated) dot pattern creates a sharper image.|$|E

40|$|With the {{exponential}} growth of LHC (Large Hadron Collider) data in 2012, distributed computing {{has become the}} established way to analyze collider data. The ATLAS grid infrastructure includes more than 130 sites worldwide, ranging from large national computing centers to smaller university clusters. HammerCloud was previously introduced {{with the goals of}} enabling VO- and site-administrators to run validation tests of the site and software infrastructure in an automated or on-demand manner. The HammerCloud infrastructure has been constantly improved to support the addition of new test <b>work-flows.</b> These new <b>work-flows</b> comprise e. g. tests of the ATLAS nightly build system, ATLAS MC production system, XRootD federation FAX and new site stress test <b>work-flows.</b> We report on the development, optimization and results of the various components in the HammerCloud framework...|$|R
25|$|The Generic Graphics Library (GEGL) {{was first}} {{introduced}} as part of GIMP on the 2.6 release of GIMP. This initial introduction does not yet exploit all of the capabilities of GEGL; as of the 2.6 release, GIMP can use GEGL to perform high bit-depth color operations; because of this less information is lost when performing color operations. When GEGL is fully integrated, GIMP will have a higher color bit depth and better non-destructive <b>work-flow.</b> Current distribution versions of GIMP only support 8-bit of color, which is much less than what e.g. digital cameras produce (12-bit or more). Full support for high bit depth is included with actual Gimp 2.9 Development version. For accelerations OpenCL is available for some operations.|$|E
25|$|The bulk of {{the report}} was {{dedicated}} to the navigational aids at Fornebu. The report underlined that false signals from the radio beacon were an important underlying cause. It noted that the beacon for runway 01 interfered with that for 06 and that up to three false signals could be transmitted. The commission recommended airlines enforce routines which ensured that multiple systems for determining position and bearing always be used, as a single system would never be reliable. It also recommended an extra radio beacon be installed in Drammen to aid approach to runway 06 and that airlines in the meantime not rely solely on radio beacons during approach to 06. The report also looked at the <b>work-flow</b> at the air traffic control. The airport had a radar system installed, but this was used solely for monitoring traffic and was not seen as a navigational aid. The commission commented that air traffic control could have prevented the accident had it recognized that the aircraft was on the wrong path and alerted the pilots. Sufficient equipment was installed, {{but there were no}} instructions for such activity.|$|E
2500|$|Lenin {{ultimately}} emerged triumphant in {{the struggle}} for hegemony of the Bolshevik faction. Relations between them in Western European exile remained tense. During {{the first decade of the}} 20th Century Bogdanov wrote two works of utopian science fiction about socialist societies on Mars, both of which were rejected by Lenin as attempts to smuggle [...] "Machist idealism" [...] into the radical movement. The second of these, a book called Engineer Menni (1913), was pronounced by Lenin to be [...] "so vague that neither a worker nor a stupid editor at Pravda [...] could understand it." [...] In 1913 Bogdanov, a student of the Taylor system of factory <b>work-flow</b> rationalization, published a massive work on the topic, General Organizational Science, which Lenin liked no better.|$|E

50|$|The {{fundamental}} difference between Maven and Ant is that Maven's design regards all projects as having a certain structure {{and a set of}} supported task <b>work-flows</b> (e.g., getting resources from source control, compiling the project, unit testing, etc.). While most software projects in effect support these operations and actually do have a well-defined structure, Maven requires that this structure and the operation implementation details be defined in the POM file. Thus, Maven relies on a convention on how to define projects and on the list of <b>work-flows</b> that are generally supported in all projects.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{this article}} {{we report on the}} effort of the {{university}} library of the Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration to integrate a digital library component for research documents authored at the university into the existing library infrastructure. Setting up a digital library has become a relatively easy task using the current data base technology and the components and tools freely available. However, to integrate such a digital library into existing library systems and to adapt existing document acquisition <b>work-flows</b> in the organization are nontrivial tasks. We use a research frame work to identify the key players in this change process and to analyze their incentive structures. Then we describe the light-weight integration approach employed by our university and show how it provides incentives to the key players {{and at the same time}} requires only minimal adaptation of the organization in terms of changing existing <b>work-flows.</b> Our experience suggests that this light-weight integration offers a cost efficient and low risk intermediate step towards switching to exclusive digital document acquisition...|$|R
