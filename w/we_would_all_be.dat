We knew that if society broke down <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> doomed. Each day a different person took a bad turn. Every time that happened, we worked as a team {{to try to keep}} the morale up." [...] He also said that some of the older miners helped to support the younger men but all have taken an oath of silence not to reveal certain details of what happened, particularly during the early weeks of desperation.|$|E
2500|$|The {{use of the}} ADE 651 has {{prompted}} strong criticism and eventually led to {{a ban on the}} device's export from the UK to Iraq and Afghanistan and a criminal investigation of its manufacturer. The Iraqi security forces' reliance on the device was highlighted by The New York Times investigation in November 2009, which reported that United States military and technical experts believed the device was useless. U.S. Army Major-General Richard Rowe told the newspaper that [...] "there's [...] magic wand that can detect explosives. If there was, <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> using it. I have no confidence that these work." [...] Sandia National Laboratories had carried out testing of several similar devices but found that [...] "none have ever performed better than random chance." [...] Retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Hal Bidlack, a former national security aide in the Clinton and Bush administrations, condemned the device as [...] "laughable, except someone down the street from you is counting on this to keep bombs off the streets." [...] An Iraqi guard and driver for The New York Times, both of whom were licensed to carry firearms, were able to drive two AK-47 rifles and ammunition through nine police checkpoints that were using the device without any of them detecting the weapons.|$|E
2500|$|In this book, hooks {{combines}} {{her personal}} life experiences, along with philosophical and psychological ideas, to shape her thesis and discuss her main concepts. She criticizes {{the way in which}} love is used in today's society. To further explain, how we use the word without much meaning, when referring to how much we like or enjoy our favorite ice cream, color, or game. Hooks is very disturbed by the fact that our culture has lost the true meaning of love, and believes it is because we have no shared definition. For this reason, the first chapter of her book primarily focuses on what she thinks the definition of love is, which she explains includes components such as care, affection, trust, respect, honesty, communication, and commitment. She proposes that if we all came to the agreement that love is a verb rather than a noun, then <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> happier. Hooks believes love is more of an interactive process. It is not about what we just feel, but more about what we do. She states, [...] "So many people think that it's enough to say what they feel, even if their actions do not correspond to what they are feeling" [...] ("A Chat"). Bell hooks strongly clarifies why society needs to adopt a universal definition of love.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{academic}} {{criticism of}} the book has sought to appropriate it {{one way or the}} other; critics like Bernard Benstock, who argued that O'Brien's embrace of myth and refusal of realism [...] "ensnare him with the second rank", have been in the minority. Vivian Mercier described it in The Irish Comic Tradition as [...] "the most fantastic novel written by an Irishman in the twentieth century– with the doubtful exception of Finnegans Wake." [...] Rüdiger Imhof has noted how works by B.S. Johnson, Gilbert Sorrentino, Alasdair Gray and John Fowles carry explicit references to At Swim-Two-Birds. Michael Cronin draws attention to the metafictional and game-playing elements of the book, comparing it to the fictions of Raymond Queneau, and responds to criticism that the book is insufficiently respectful of realist conventions:Contrary to what Benstock argues, what post-independence Ireland needed was not less but more of the type of playful, self-aware writing being proposed by Flann O'Brien in At Swim-Two-Birds.... <b>We</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> very much poorer without Mad O'Brien's narrative chessmen.Keith Hopper has argued that, contrary to the common tendency to favour At Swim-Two-Birds as [...] "the primary defining text of the O'Brien oeuvre", the novel is in fact less, not more, experimental than O'Brien's second novel, the posthumously published The Third Policeman:At Swim-Two-Birds is best considered as a late-modernist, transitional text which critiques both realism and modernism in an openly deconstructive manner, and in the process comes to the brink of an exciting new aesthetic. I will argue that the metafictional techniques developed publicly in ... are imbricated and embedded within the texture of The Third Policeman.|$|E

"I {{have urged}} {{for a couple}} of years now for the need to think {{strategically}} about the issue and try and move to a high volume, low price paradigm, and I think the shock of this week's events in South Africa will now take them in that direction.

You had thrown your motley aside to don a dingy red coat; you were {{the hero of the}} play, you performed the gallant deeds, you made the noble speeches. I wonder what the play would be like, were we all to write our own parts.

Finally, were you all like me, I would consider you so common that I would not care to associate with you. To be individual, my friends, to be different from others, {{is the only way to}} become distinguished from the common herd.

These had high, steep banks on each side, and every time we flew down one bank and scrambled up the other, our party inside got mixed somewhat. First <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> down in a pile at the forward end of the stage, nearly in a sitting posture, and in a second we would shoot to the other end, and stand on our heads. And we would sprawl and kick, too, and ward off ends and corners of mail-bags that came lumbering over us and about us; and as the dust rose from the tumult, we would all sneeze in chorus, and the majority of us would grumble, and probably say some hasty thing, like: [...] "Take your elbow out of my ribs!--can't you quit crowding?" ...|$|E
6000|$|One could {{respect the}} {{argument}} that Dublin, with much poverty and many slums, could not afford the £22,000 the building was to cost the city, but not the minds that used it. One frenzied man compared the pictures to Troy horse which 'destroyed a city,' and innumerable correspondents described Sir Hugh Lane {{and those who had}} subscribed many thousands to give Dublin paintings by Corot, Manet, Monet, Degas, and Renoir, as 'self-seekers,' 'self-advertisers,' 'picture-dealers,' 'log-rolling cranks and faddists,' and one clerical paper told 'picture-dealer Lane' to take himself and his pictures out of that. A member of the Corporation said there were Irish artists who could paint as good if they had a mind to, and another described a half-hour in the temporary gallery in Harcourt Street as the most dismal of his life. Some one else asked instead of these eccentric pictures to be given pictures 'like those beautiful productions displayed in the windows of our city picture shops.' Another thought that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> more patriotic if we devoted our energy to fighting the Insurance Act. Another would not hang them in his kitchen, while yet another described the vogue of French impressionist painting as having gone to such a length among 'log-rolling enthusiasts' that they even admired 'works that were rejected from the Salon forty years ago by the finest critics in the world.' ...|$|E

In fact, it was one of this strange man's peculiarities that it was just those delicate and personal scenes with which privacy is usually associated that he preferred to have in public, for he knew that his reproaches had an additional sting when they fell upon other ears besides those of his victim. From his wife to his groom there was not one of those who were about him who did not live in dread of being held up to ridicule and infamy before a smiling crowd, whose amusement was only tempered by the reflection that each of them might be the next to endure the same exposure.|$|R
