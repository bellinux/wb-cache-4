5|$|A band of ranch land on Mauna Kea's lower slopes was {{formerly}} Acacia koa – Metrosideros polymorpha (koa-ōhia) forest. Its destruction {{was driven by}} an influx of European and American settlers in the early 19th century, as extensive logging during the 1830s provided lumber for new homes. Vast swathes of the forest were burned and cleared for sugarcane plantations. Most of the houses on the island were built of koa, and {{those parts of the}} forest that survived became a source for firewood to power boilers on the sugarcane plantations and to heat homes. The once vast forest had almost disappeared by 1880, and by 1900 logging interests had shifted to Kona and the island of Maui.

5|$|Supporters of {{the project}} {{suggested}} that the cheap electricity provided by the dam would be a strong enticement for electricity-intensive industries, such as aluminum smelting, to move to Alaska. They were encouraged by a 1962 economic feasibility study by the Development and Resources Corporation, which stated that the electricity generated would attract aluminum, magnesium and titanium industries to the region and help process locally produced minerals. The report also stated that the dam would attract a <b>wood</b> <b>pulp</b> mill on at least a temporary basis to process {{the hundreds of millions}} of board feet of timber that would otherwise be lost as the dam's reservoir flooded. The authors of the DRC report were specific enough to predict that 19,746 jobs would be created by the dam's construction—not including jobs opened during the construction process. Both the 1962 study, and another report by University of Michigan researcher Michael Brewer in 1966, stated that tens of thousands of jobs would be created by the construction process alone, even if the cheap electricity generated by the dam failed to attract any additional industries to Alaska.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the dozens}} of extant wasp families, only the family Vespidae {{contains}} social species, primarily in the subfamilies Vespinae and Polistinae. With their powerful stings and conspicuous warning coloration, often in black and yellow, social wasps are frequent models for Batesian mimicry by non-stinging insects, and are themselves involved in mutually beneficial Müllerian mimicry of other distasteful insects including bees and other wasps. All species of social wasps construct their nests using some form of plant fiber (mostly <b>wood</b> <b>pulp)</b> as the primary material, though this can be supplemented with mud, plant secretions (e.g., resin), and secretions from the wasps themselves; multiple fibrous brood cells are constructed, arranged in a honeycombed pattern, and often surrounded by a larger protective envelope. Wood fibers are gathered from weathered wood, softened by chewing and mixing with saliva. The placement of nests varies from group to group; yellow jackets such as D. media and D. sylvestris prefer to nest in trees and shrubs; P. exigua attaches its nests {{on the underside of}} leaves and branches; Polistes erythrocephalus chooses sites close to a water source. Other wasps, like A. multipicta and V. germanica, like to nest in cavities that include holes in the ground, spaces under homes, wall cavities or in lofts. While most species of wasps have nests with multiple combs, some species, such as Apoica flavissima, only have one comb. The length of the reproductive cycle depends on latitude; Polistes erythrocephalus, for example, has a much longer (up to 3 months longer) cycle in temperate regions.|$|E
5|$|The port {{remained}} open {{to service}} the papermills, importing <b>wood</b> <b>pulp</b> and esparto grass from Russia and Scandinavia, using mainly East European registered vessels after World War II. Requiring a return load, {{the result was that}} Watchet became a leading UK port for the export of car parts, tractors and other industrial goods. However, with the replacement of coal with oil from the mid-1960s, the port traffic began to terminally decline. The harbour was in commercial use until 2000, the harbour has now been converted into a marina for pleasure boats. It is surrounded by renovated quaysides and narrow streets. The commercial esplanade has been refurbished with new shelters, information points, and the provision of new paving in some areas, as well as railings, lamps, curved benches, planters and new tree plantings. There are several museums in the town, including the Market House Museum, which explores the history of the town and its harbour. The building was constructed in 1820 {{on the site of the}} previous market house which had been demolished in 1805. It was converted into a museum in 1979. It houses a collection of exhibits about the natural history of Watchet and the surrounding area. The focus is on nautical and maritime history of the port. Artefacts include those relating to: Archaeology, Coins and Medals, Land Transport, Maritime, Natural Sciences, Science and Technology and Social History. At the rear of the museum building is the old town lock-up for the temporary detention of people, often drunks who were usually released the next day or to hold people being brought before the local magistrate. The Watchet Boat Museum, which is housed in the 1862 Victorian architecture former railway goods shed, displays the unusual local flatner boats and associated artefacts.|$|E

40|$|Soy-protein is used, for {{the first}} time, as bulk binder in {{papermaking}} from <b>wood</b> <b>pulps</b> (hardwood and softwood <b>pulps).</b> <b>Wood</b> <b>pulps</b> represent the major pulps used for paper production. A green denaturing method, involving only biodegradable compounds, was found sufficient to expose the functional groups of proteins. Addition of denatured soy-protein caused a considerable increase in all strength properties of paper, at all beating degrees. The effect was highest in non-wood (for comparison) followed by hardwood and softwood pulps respectively. This could be correlated to ratio of fiber length/width, fines, and hemicellulose content of pulps. The less the ratio, and the higher the fines and hemicellulose content, the more was the increase in strength properties; due to more exposed surfaces.

40|$|The {{processing}} of wood to yield such varied products as paper, paperboard, lumber, plywood, and reconstituted building board {{ranks among the}} ten largest industrial activi-ties in the United States. To produce paper or paperboard, the <b>wood</b> is first <b>pulped.</b> Pulps are made from wood chips, whole tree chips, sawmill residues, or logs. Pulps can be produced through chemical or mechanical means or {{by a combination of}} both. The pulp may then be bleached to various degrees of brightness. Finally, bleached or un-bleached pulp is processed into thick sheets of paperboard or paper. The manufacture of building boards, with a few exceptions, involves processing the wood itself into sheets or boards, with the aid of adhesives. The following material is intended to provide a broad overview of selected segments of the wood processing in-dustry. The production process, atmospheric emissions, and emission control technologies employed are described for (l), several chemical <b>wood</b> <b>pulping</b> processes, (2) mechani-cal <b>wood</b> <b>pulping</b> processes, and (3) paper and paperboard manufacture. It should be recognized that this manual only provides information on the most common manufacturing processes and control technologies.
