25|$|On March 4, 1991, Francis {{was traded}} to the Pittsburgh Penguins, along with Ulf Samuelsson and Grant Jennings, in {{exchange}} for John Cullen, Zarley Zalapski and Jeff Parker. Francis {{was one of the most}} popular players on the team, and held nearly every significant offensive record in the franchise's history, both in the WHA and NHL. The trade was condemned by Whalers fans, most of whom were not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> The Hockey News assessment that the Whalers had actually received the better end of the bargain. Less than two weeks after the trade, Parker suffered a career-ending knee injury. The Francis trade was made all the more painful when Francis and Samuelsson promptly helped lead the Penguins to two consecutive Stanley Cup titles. Coincidentally, Eddie Johnston, the Hartford general manager who had orchestrated the Francis trade, would follow him to Pittsburgh as the Penguins' head coach two years later.|$|E

They sailed north, and Darwin wondered about the fossils he had found. The giant Mastodons and Megatheriums were extinct, but he had found no geological signs of a [...] "diluvial debacle" [...] or of the changed circumstances that, in Lyell's view, led to species no longer being adapted to the position they were created to fit.

[...] "I {{am amazed}} – yes, {{that is the}} word, amazed", he said, [...] "that France's fine expeditionary corps in Indochina is {{commanded}} by officers who would rather negotiate than fight". D'Argenlieu stated that a higher level meeting in Paris would be required. He then unilaterally declared a French-controlled Autonomous Republic of Cochinchina without asking either Paris or the Vietnamese. In 1946, Leclerc was replaced as commander of the French forces by Jean-Étienne Valluy.

500|$|The player {{takes on}} the role of Lara, who is a young and ambitious {{archaeology}} graduate whose theories on the location of the lost kingdom of Yamatai have convinced the Nishimura family—descendants from the people of Yamatai themselves—to fund an expedition in search of the kingdom. The expedition is led by Dr. James Whitman, a celebrity archaeologist who has fallen on hard times and is desperate to avoid bankruptcy, and is accompanied by Conrad Roth, a Royal Marine turned adventurer and close friend of the Croft family who serves as mentor to Lara; Samantha [...] "Sam" [...] Nishimura, Lara's friend and a representative of the Nishimura family who films the expedition for a documentary; Joslyn Reyes, a skeptical and temperamental mechanic and single mother; Jonah Maiava, an imposing and placid fisherman who is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in the existence of the paranormal and esoteric; Angus [...] "Grim" [...] Grimaldi, the gruff Glaswegian helmsman of the Endurance; and Alex Weiss, a goofy and bespectacled electronics specialist.|$|E

The Americans {{believed that}} Rafsanjani had the power to order Hezbollah to free the American hostages and establishing a relationship with him [...] by selling Iran arms would ultimately place Iran back within the American sphere of influence. It remains unclear if Rafsanjani really wanted a rapprochement with the United States or was just deceiving Reagan administration officials who were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that he was a moderate who would effect a rapprochement. Rafsanjani, whose nickname is [...] "the Shark" [...] was described by the British journalist Patrick Brogan as a man of great charm and formidable intelligence known for his subtlety and ruthlessness whose motives in the Iran–Contra affair remain completely mysterious. The Israeli government required that the sale of arms meet high level approval from the United States government, and when McFarlane convinced them that the U.S. government approved the sale, Israel obliged by agreeing to sell the arms.|$|E

2500|$|While Schiller's <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> is {{a central}} theme of Riddle of the Sphinx (appearing mainly in the {{introduction}} and conclusion of his text), in 1891 the doctrine held a limited role in Schiller's philosophy. In Riddles, Schiller only employs {{his version of the}} <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> doctrine when he is faced with overcoming sceptic and pessimistic methods of philosophy. In 1897, William James published his essay [...] "The <b>Will</b> <b>to</b> Believe" [...] and this influenced Schiller to drastically expanded his application of the doctrine. For a 1903 volume titled Personal Idealism, Schiller contributed a widely read essay titled [...] "Axioms as Postulates" [...] in which he sets out to justify the [...] "axioms of logic" [...] as postulates adopted {{on the basis of the}} <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> doctrine. In this essay Schiller extends the <b>will</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> doctrine <b>to</b> be the basis of our acceptance of causality, of the uniformity of nature, of our concept of identity, of contradiction, of the law of excluded middle, of space and time, of the goodness of God, and more.

2500|$|Despite {{this early}} interest, most {{scientists}} ignored Stevenson's work. According to his New York Times obituary, his detractors {{saw him as}} [...] "earnest, dogged but ultimately misguided, led astray by gullibility, wishful thinking and a tendency to see science where others saw superstition." [...] Critics suggested that the children or their parents had deceived him, {{that he was too}} <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> them, and that he had asked them leading questions. In addition, critics said, the results were subject to confirmation bias, in that cases not supportive of the hypothesis were not presented as counting against it.

2500|$|The {{content of}} her letters {{does not permit}} one to see her primary motives as {{anything}} other than propagandistic. She is not at all interested in broadening her cultural and intellectual horizons. Catherine seeks no advice from Voltaire on how to rule Russia….Instead Catherine tries to impose her views, justify her policies and explain away her failures. Voltaire is, for Catherine, the best method of diffusing favorable information in Europe. As a testament to Catherine's political ingenuity, she skillfully kept Voltaire at arm's length, feigning a belief in absolute liberalism in her letters while, in practice, implementing repressive reforms in her country. For example, the opinion she shares with Voltaire regarding serfdom did not always correspond with the laws she passed. [...] "The Empress turned over 800,000 peasants to private proprietors. The 1763 law limiting freedom of movement by requiring the peasant to get a permit from the landlord before he/she could leave the property has been cited as evidence that Catherine enserfed peasants in the name of fiscal expediency,". [...] Catherine's correspondence largely acted as propaganda intended to assure Voltaire (and Europe) of Russia's prosperity. [...] Handicapped by distance and a lack of information, Voltaire was simply too <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in Catherine's liberalism.|$|E
2500|$|The early 1950s {{also saw}} a number of movies {{depicting}} flying saucers and aliens, including The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951), The War of the Worlds, Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (1956), and Forbidden Planet (1956). Despite this, public belief in ETH seems to have remained low during the early 1950s, even among those reporting UFOs. A poll published in Popular Science magazine, in August 1951, showed that 52% of UFO witnesses questioned believed that they had seen a man-made aircraft, while only 4% believed that they had seen an alien craft. [...] However, an additional 28% were uncertain, {{with more than half}} of these stating they believed they were either man-made aircraft or [...] "visitors from afar". [...] Thus the total number of UFO witnesses who considered the ETH viable was approximately 20%. Within a few years, belief in ETH had increased due to the activities of people such as retired U.S. Marine Corps officer Maj. Donald E. Keyhoe, who campaigned to raise public awareness of the UFO phenomenon. By 1957, 25% of Americans responded that they either believed, or were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe,</b> in ETH, while 53% responded that they were not (though a majority of these respondents indicated they thought UFOs to be real but of earthly origin). 22% said that they were uncertain.|$|E
