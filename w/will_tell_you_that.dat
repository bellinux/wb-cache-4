5|$|When making observations, {{scientists}} {{look through}} telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a basic level, they {{can agree on}} what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if these scientists have different ideas about the theories {{that have been developed}} to explain these basic observations, they may disagree about what they are observing. For example, before Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, observers would have likely interpreted the image at left as five different objects in space. In light of that theory, however, astronomers <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> there are actually only two objects, one in the center and four different images of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be theory-laden.|$|E

One New York Times writer found [...] "little {{justification}} for installing either team as the favorite". Regardless of the odds, players from both teams were confident of victory. Hornsby said, [...] "We're {{going to come}} through winners. We have the better pitching staff, the better hitters and the greater experience. That's {{what it takes to}} win. ...

Microsoft intended the rules to be [...] "flexible", and, because it was unilateral, the license was legally unable to reduce rights. However, machinima artists, such as Edgeworks Entertainment, protested the prohibitions on extending Microsoft's fictional universes (a common component of fan fiction) and on selling anything from sites hosting derivative works. Compounding the reaction was the license's statement, [...] "If you do any of these things, you can expect to hear from Microsoft's lawyers who <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> you have to stop distributing your items right away." ...|$|E

Biohazard, Mindless Self Indulgence, Krayzie Bone, and Twiztid were well {{received}} by audiences; however, Coal Chamber was not. Insane Clown Posse fans were not purchasing tickets, {{as they did}} not like Coal Chamber. For the three shows that Coal Chamber played, there were multiple ticket refunds. Bruce and his brother, Rob, {{made the decision to}} eliminate Coal Chamber from the tour. After doing so, there were no tickets returned {{for the remainder of the}} tour dates. Bruce and Utsler claimed that Coal Chamber had been removed from the tour because of equipment problems, but later revealed the true reason for their actions on The Howard Stern Show, which aired August 19, 1999. Bruce continued by saying, [...] "Nobody <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that,</b> because everybody's afraid of your crumpet-ass bitch manager". Later that night, Stern contacted Bruce and Utsler, asking them to appear on his show the following day to talk with Coal Chamber's manager, Sharon Osbourne.|$|E

500|$|In 2004, Antestor {{changed their}} style {{into a more}} modern black metal, and {{released}} their first set of new songs since The Return of the Black Death in an EP called Det tapte liv ("The Lost Life"). Det tapte liv concentrated less on the black metal aspects of Antestor's style, instead focusing more on instrumental songs. [...] However, it hinted at what the band was preparing for their 2005 full-length, The Forsaken. The cover arts for both releases were once again done by Kristian Wåhlin, and the cover for the EP depicts the Borgund Stave Church. Hellhammer played all drums on both of these releases. In {{an interview with the}} Russian metal site Metal Library on January 7, 2007, Blomberg was asked what did his Mayhem colleagues and record company think about his participation in Antestor, and he said: [...] "To be honest, it was a big 'fuck off!' to them all. I will repeat again that I decide what I do and I play not only in black metal groups." [...] The band also asked Hellhammer to play live for them, but Blomberg refused. Hellhammer also went to state: [...] "In my opinion, black metal today is just music. I <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> neither I nor other members of Mayhem never really were against religion or something else. We are primarily interested in music." [...] Ronny Hansen commented on Blomberg's appearance: ...|$|E
500|$|Writer John Swartzwelder {{has noted}} that the staff members of the show write the {{character}} Homer {{in the same way}} that they write Santa's Little Helper: [...] "Both are loyal. Both have the same emotional range. And both will growl and possibly snap if you try to take their food." [...] Although animals in cartoons often behave with [...] "semi-human awareness", Groening said on the DVD audio commentary for the episode [...] "Two Dozen and One Greyhounds" [...] that he prefers animals in cartoons to behave exactly the way they do in real life. As a result, Santa's Little Helper is depicted in this way on the show. There have, however, been some exceptions for gags, but most of the time the staff of The Simpsons tries to keep animals acting realistically. Several journalists have commented on the greyhound's lack of intelligence. In an article that compared The Simpsons to the animated series Family Guy, Todd Camp of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram noted that [...] "though Santa's Little Helper may be the only Simpson who's dumber than Homer, the Griffins' pooch [...] is the brainiest member of the household". In 1991, Copley News Service's Alison Ashton described Santa's Little Helper as a [...] "sweet and stupid dog". Tom Coombe of The Morning Call wrote in 2002 that [...] "fans of The Simpsons <b>will</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> the cartoon family's dog [...] is often dumb, disobedient and skittish.
