5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the Categorical Imperative provides us with the maxim that {{we ought not to}} lie in any circumstances, even if we are trying to bring about good consequences, such as lying to a murderer to prevent them from finding their intended victim. Kant argued that, because we cannot fully know <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of any action will be, the result might be unexpectedly harmful. Therefore, we ought to act to avoid the known wrong—lying—rather than to avoid a potential wrong. If there are harmful consequences, we are blameless because we acted according to our duty. Driver argues that this might not be a problem if we choose to formulate our maxims differently: the maxim 'I will lie to save an innocent life' can be universalized. However, this new maxim may still treat the murderer as a means to an end, which we have a duty to avoid doing. Thus we may still be required to tell the truth to the murderer in Kant's example.|$|E
25|$|Rutledge {{also argued}} that if either house of the {{legislature}} {{was to have the}} sole authority to introduce appropriation bills, it should be the Senate. He noted that the Senate, by nature of its lengthier terms of office, would tend to be more leisurely in its actions. Because of this, Rutledge felt that the Senate would be better able to think clearly about <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of a bill would be. Also, since the bills could not become law without the consent of the House of Representatives, he concluded {{that there would be no}} danger of the Senate ruling the country.|$|E
25|$|Political {{and popular}} debate {{concerning}} {{the existence and}} cause of climate change includes {{the reasons for the}} increase seen in the instrumental temperature record, whether the warming trend exceeds normal climatic variations, and whether human activities have contributed significantly to it. Scientists have resolved these questions decisively in favour of the view that the current warming trend exists and is ongoing, that human activity is the cause, and that it is without precedent in at least 2000 years. Public disputes that also reflect scientific debate include estimates of how responsive the climate system might be to any given level of greenhouse gases (climate sensitivity), how global climate change will play out at local and regional scales, and <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of global warming will be.|$|E

500|$|Fair {{dealing in}} United Kingdom {{law is a}} {{doctrine}} which provides an exception to United Kingdom copyright law, {{in cases where the}} copyright infringement is for the purposes of non-commercial research or study, criticism or review, or for the reporting of current events. More limited than the United States doctrine of fair use, fair dealing originates in Sections 29 and 30 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, and requires the infringer to show not only that their copying falls into one of the three fair dealing categories, but also that it is [...] "fair" [...] and, in some cases, that it contains sufficient acknowledgement for the original author. Factors when deciding the [...] "fairness" [...] of the copying can include the quantity of the work taken, whether It was previously published, the motives of the infringer and <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of the infringement on the original author's returns for the copyrighted work will be.|$|E
500|$|After Budington and the {{remainder}} of the crew were rescued and returned to the United States, the board of inquiry continued. Budington attacked Tyson's credibility, disputing Tyson's claim that he had obstructed Hall's efforts to sail the ship further north. He also disputed reports of his drinking, saying that he [...] " [...] it a practice to drink but very little". Bessels was questioned about Hall's cause of death. Bessels stated that [...] "My idea of the cause of the first attack is that he had been exposed to very low temperature during the time that he was on the sledge journey. He came back and entered a warm cabin without taking off his heavy fur clothing, and then took a warm cup of coffee. And anyone knows <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of that might be." [...] Bessels testified that Hall was [...] "taken by hemiplegia", and his left arm and side were paralyzed, and that he had injected Hall with quinine to correct his elevated temperature before he died.|$|E
500|$|Like {{his father}} before, Dejan's eldest son Jovan {{received}} {{the title of}} despot from Emperor Uroš. [...] He and his brother later received most of Jovan Oliver's lands. It is not known why Jovan Oliver's sons did not inherit his lands. Serbian historian V. Ćorović attributed this to turmoil and disorder, {{though it is not}} known what extent it developed to and <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> were. Earlier scholars believed that the Dejanović were relatives of Jovan Oliver, although this is no longer accepted. The Dejanović brothers ruled a spacious province in eastern Macedonia, in the southern lands of the Empire, and remained loyal to Uroš V until his death. Emperor Uroš V died childless on December 2/4, 1371, after many of the Serbian nobility had been killed in the Battle of Maritsa against the Ottomans earlier that year. This marked an end to the once powerful Serbian Empire. [...] Vukašin's son Marko, who had earlier been crowned Young King, was to inherit his father's royal title, and thus became one in the line of successors to the Serbian throne. Meanwhile, the nobles pursued their own interests, sometimes quarreling with each other. [...] Serbia, without an Emperor, became [...] "a conglomerate of aristocratic territories", and the Empire was thus divided between the provincial lords: Marko Mrnjavčević, the Dejanović brothers, Đurađ I Balšić, Vuk Branković, Nikola Altomanović, and Lazar Hrebeljanović. In the new redistribution of feudal power, after 1371, the brothers despot Jovan and gospodin (lord) Konstantin greatly expanded their province, not only recreating their father's province, but also at least doubling the territory, on all sides, but chiefly to the south. The brothers ruled on the left riverside of the Vardar, from Kumanovo to Strumica. [...] In 1373, two years after Maritsa, the first mentions are made on the events in the province of the Dejanović brothers, as well as their mutual relation. As Marko had done, also the Dejanović brothers recognized Ottoman sovereignty. Although vassals, they had their own government. Their state symbol was the white double-headed eagle and they minted coins according to the Nemanjić style.|$|E

2500|$|The {{editor who}} {{originally}} approved the cartoons, Carsten Juste, later {{declared that the}} opponents of free speech had [...] "won" [...] because the furor would almost undoubtedly deter future editors from printing anything similar.

2500|$|Similarly, Norman Manea placed Negoiţescu's public {{profile in}} {{relation}} with the aesthetic ideals of his work: [...] "The indestructible attachment toward beauty and aesthetics has fortified the otherwise sober and frail being of the writer through times of Iron Guardist exultation, {{as well as through}} times of communist disarray and persecution. [...] The ugliness, barbarity, vulgarity and stupidity into which the great totalitarian setup quickly crumbles have proved themselves [...] rejected by Beauty." [...] Matei Călinescu mentioned his older friend's [...] "internally proud awareness of his own genius", as manifested against such definitions of genius as were being favored by [...] "communist cultural parochialism". Contrasting Negoiţescu's [...] "aestheticism", [...] "individualism" [...] and [...] "quasi-anarchism" [...] with the [...] "gray, stiff and fear-impregnated everyday of communism", Călinescu also noted: [...] "Nego's daily heroism was that of being himself, no matter <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> of this social preservation of his identity and the refusal to hide it." [...] Such views, Ion Vianu adds, transformed Negoiţescu into [...] "the perfect, exemplary victim of communism".|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson is unsympathetic to {{the green}} {{movement}} and has little respect for groups such as Greenpeace—he believes that the [...] "eco-mentalists" [...] are a by-product of the [...] "old trade unionists and CND lesbians" [...] who had found a more relevant cause—but [...] "loves the destination" [...] of environmentalism and believes that people should quietly strive to be more eco-friendly. Regarding windfarms, he {{says that in the}} future, they will be described as [...] "a reminder of the time when mankind temporarily took leave of its senses and decided wind, waves and lashings of tofu could somehow generate enough electricity for the whole planet". Clarkson has voiced some views regarding global warming: he believes that higher temperatures are not necessarily negative and that anthropogenic carbon dioxide production has a negligible effect on the global climate, but is aware of the negative potential consequences of global warming, saying [...] "let's just stop and think for a moment <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> might be.

2500|$|Meyer {{decided to}} include the {{pregnancy}} in her story while she was researching vampires, early in 2003, and came across {{the legend of the}} incubus, a demon who could father children. Bella's insistence to not let her child die was inspired by Meyer's reaction when asked if she would let one of her children die so she could live, which was to deliver the child no matter <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>consequences</b> were. Meyer {{said in an interview with}} Shannon Hale, published in , that the birth scene published is a little less grotesque than the one she wrote before editing due to her editor, agent and publisher's requests to [...] "tone down the violence a little". She stated that Bella's pregnancy and childbirth, for her, were [...] "a way to kind of explore that concept of what childbirth used to be" [...] in the past and acknowledged that they were [...] "taking Bella in a new direction that wasn't [...] relatable for a lot of people." [...] Concerning the subject of the relatability of Bella, Meyer admitted that she lost some of her relatability to the character when she became a vampire and said, [...] "every point up until that point in the story [...] I would say I could step into this story right here and I could do everything she could do which made it really fun." [...] Meyer wanted to experience Bella's vampiric experiences and [...] "enjoyed very much" [...] writing about them and wanted to end the book from her perspective, but still thought it was [...] "a little bit harder" [...] as she couldn't step in into the story anymore.|$|E
