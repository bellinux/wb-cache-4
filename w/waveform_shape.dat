40|$|Blood {{pressure}} waveform {{features and}} non-invasive central pressure estimation are increasingly used {{in research and}} clinical environments. Brachial cuff based biomedical devices often use an arbitrary absolute cuff pressure to measure waveforms. That is, cuff pressure is not relative to a person’s own blood pressure. This may alter the measured <b>waveform</b> <b>shape,</b> changing outcomes. This study investigates the impact of cuff pressure on pulse <b>waveform</b> <b>shape.</b> Supine brachial systolic, diastolic, and true mean blood pressure was measured in 14 healthy volunteers (age 25 to 60 years, 2 female) using the oscillometric technique. Brachial volume pressure pulse was measured using a standard brachial cuff inflated to: 10 mmHg below diastolic pressure (subdiastolic); mean pressure; 10 mmHg above systolic pressure (suprasystolic). At each cuff pressure, 10 seconds of data was acquired (sampling rate 2 kHz, 0. 2 second Bartlett smoothing window) and averaged to form a single pulse waveform. <b>Waveform</b> <b>shape</b> was quantified in terms of form factor ((mean– diastolic pressure) /pulse pressure), normalised root mean square (RMS), and frequency components. Waveforms acquired at each cuff pressure, the radial artery pressure waveform acquired by tonometry, and form factor calculated from brachial oscillometric blood pressure values were statistically compared. Form factor was significantly different (p‹ 0. 001) between subdiastolic (0. 56 ± 0. 04), mean pressure (0. 49 ± 0. 05) and suprasystolic (0. 24 ± 0. 03) cuff pressures. This was also significantly different (p‹ 0. 001) to form factor acquired by oscillometric method (0. 33 ± 0. 02) and radial tonometry (0. 32 ± 0. 03). Oscillometric brachial and tonometric radial form factor was not significantly different (p‹ 0. 64). Normalised RMS values did not differ between suprasystolic (0. 41 ± 0. 04) and radial tonometry (0. 42 ± 0. 03) but were significantly different (p‹ 0. 001) between suprasystolic, mean pressure (0. 59 ± 0. 03) and subdiastolic (0. 64 ± 0. 03) values.

40|$|Electrical microstimulation {{has been}} widely used to artificially {{activate}} neural circuits on fast time scales. Despite the ubiquity of its use, {{little is known about}} precisely how it activates neural pathways. Current is typically delivered to neural tissue in a manner that provides a locally balanced injection of positive and negative charge, resulting in negligible net charge delivery to avoid the neurotoxic effects of charge accumulation. Modeling studies have suggested that the most common approach, using a temporally symmetric current pulse waveform as the base unit of stimulation, results in preferential activation of axons, causing diffuse activation of neurons relative to the stimulation site. Altering <b>waveform</b> <b>shape</b> and using an asymmetric current pulse waveform theoretically reverses this bias and preferentially activates cell bodies, providing increased specificity. In separate studies, measurements of downstream cortical activation from sub-cortical microstimulation are consistent with this hypothesis, as are recent measurements of behavioral detection threshold currents from cortical microstimulation.

We present cosinusoidal AM pulses as stimuli where {{we are able to}} manipulate <b>waveform</b> <b>shape</b> independently of the fixed repetition rate of 4 Hz. We either present sounds in which the <b>waveform</b> <b>shape,</b> the pulse-width, is fixed throughout the presentation or where it varies pseudo-randomly. Importantly, the average spectra of all the fixed-width AM stimuli are equal to the spectra of the mixed-width AM. Our null hypothesis is that the average ASSR to the fixed-width AM will not be significantly different from the ASSR to the mixed-width AM. In a region of interest beamformer analysis of MEG data, we compare the 4 Hz component of the ASSR to the mixed-width AM with the 4 Hz component of the ASSR to the pooled fixed-width AM. We find that at the group level, there is a significantly greater response to the variable mixed-width AM at the medial boundary of the Middle and Superior Temporal Gyri. Hence, we find that adding variability into AM stimuli increases the amplitude of the ASSR.

Further investigation and control of these physical processes, including high-harmonic generation, ask for the capability of <b>waveform</b> <b>shaping</b> on sub-cycle time scales, which requires a fully phase-controlled multiple-octave-spanning spectrum. In this paper, we present a light source that enables sub-cycle <b>waveform</b> <b>shaping</b> with a two-octave-spanning spectrum and 15 ?J pulse energy based on coherent synthesis of pulses with different spectra, or wavelength multiplexing. The synthesized pulse has its shortest high-field transient lasting only 0. 8 cycles (amplitude FWHM) of the centroid frequency. The benefit of the approach lies in its modular design and scalability in both bandwidth and pulse energy. Full phase control allows for the synthesis of any optical waveform supported by the amplified spectrum. A numerical study shows the uniqueness of the light source for direct isolated soft-x-ray pulse generation based on high-harmonic generation, greatly reducing and eventually even eliminating the need for gating techniques or spectral filtering.

40|$|We {{developed}} a parametric {{method of estimating}} the Doppler ultrasound (US) umbilical maximal flow waveform envelope that is robust to varying levels of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The method differs from previously proposed estimation algorithms in {{that it does not}} incorporate preliminary removal or reduction of noise; thus, avoiding potential resulting biases. Instead, we relied on a multiple time series interpretation that facilitates a regression approach. The maximal <b>waveform</b> <b>shape</b> was assumed to {{take the form of a}} periodic series of gamma functions with a hidden baseline that is typically not reached on the downward diastolic phase before the flow increases to the systolic peak. The <b>waveform</b> <b>shape</b> is fitted via optimisation of the cross correlation of the Doppler signal and a periodic reference function locating the cardiac cycles within the blood flow image. Starting values for the iterative optimisation process were obtained using nonstandard least squares regression. Assessments of the fit of the model to waveform data were carried out through visual inspection. In 7 of 327 images analysed (2. 1 %), there appeared to be some discrepancy between the <b>waveform</b> <b>shape</b> and the gamma waveform envelope, such as variations in systolic or diastolic flows. Modification of the estimation procedure to incorporate blood flow cycles of slightly different lengths and use of other functional forms may improve the fit for waveforms for which the gamma fit is poor.
