40|$|One of {{the trends}} in ship {{building}} is {{the building of}} larger and faster ships. However, increasing demand for speed has forced the ship designers to search for alternative materials to reduce {{the weight of the}} ship without compromising strength. Aluminium alloys, once properly designed, can achieve this goal by reducing the weight of structural components by over 50 % compared to those made of normal carbon steel. Another advantage of aluminium alloys is that its corrosion resistance. In a sea environment, steel has been found to corrode about 100 times faster than aluminium alloys under the same corrosive environment. As the size of aluminium ship increases, fatigue {{has become one of the}} main design criteria. In order to effectively make use of the high strength/weight ratio of aluminium alloys, the cross section of the structural components as well as the joint design should be optimized to provide sufficient fatigue strength while still maintain acceptable fabrication cost. Extruded hollow stiffeners have been proven to be able to provide excellent light and stiff panels for aluminium ships. Box stiffener is such a cross section profile investigated in the present study. The box stiffener is usually oriented longitudinally by interacting with a large number of web frames by fillet welds. These welded joints may be exposed to larger fatigue damage due to its significant stress variations experienced during the service of the ships. In addition, welding of these joints is quite costly since there are a lage amount of them and it is difficult to apply automatic welding due to complex profile. Any simplification in the welding procedure would cause a significant benefit to the ship builders. Three similar web frame/box stiffener connections are considered in these studies, by varying the opening shape on the web fame and accordingly the welding procedure. The objective is to achieve sufficient fatigue strength while still maintaining an economically efficient joint. The first connection (denoted as Alt- 1) tries to make a relatively larger opening on the <b>web</b> <b>frame</b> for easy assembling and more space for welding. The second and third alternatives (denoted as Alt- 2 and Alt- 3) are identical in the opening on the <b>web</b> <b>frame</b> while differs on welding procedure only. Interrupted welding is performed for Alt- 2 to save both the human resource and weld material while continuous welding is required for Alt- 3 for a simple welding procedure. Alt- 3 also provides a water tight solution due to the continuous welding. It is found that the change of cutting shapes on the <b>web</b> <b>frame</b> as well as the corresponding weld procedure has great impact on both the static and fatigue properties of the joints. Extra welding around the <b>web</b> <b>frame</b> may cause a high stress concentration at the weld toe and therefore imply an unacceptable fatigue damage. However, a simple weld can be a good candidate to achieve sufficient fatigue strength. Butt weld is usually used to join two pre-fabricated units to obtain sufficient overall strength of the joined single piece structure. However, difficulty may arise for such units when the box stiffeners are presented as the longitudinal stiffeners due to relatively large shrinkage and distortion introduced in the fabrication process including welding in the adjacent area. A special type of lap joint, denoted as box stiffener lap joint is designed to provide a joining solution for the box stiffeners. By enabling the inside profile of the lapping plate to be identical to the outside profile of the box stiffener, the joining of two box stiffeners is just to weld the intersection lines between the lapping plate and box stiffener. Only the wide flanges of the box stiffener require a conventional weld. Cracking from the weld root should be avoided to ensure sufficient fatigue strength. Good fatigue performance is observed for the box stiffener lap joint. The weld leg length is found to be a determining factor that affects both the fatigue strength and fatigue crack initiation site. Weld leg length between 6. 0 and 7. 5 mm is suggested to avoid high stress concentration at the weld toe. Moreover, this design reduces the likelihood of fatigue cracks to initiate from the most complex manual welding area. Information about fatigue analysis of welded aluminium structures is quite limited in the open literature. This thesis deals with fatigue assessment methods of welded aluminium plate structures based on both numerical analysis and experimental tests. Various stress based fatigue assessment methods such as the nominal, structural and notch stress approaches have been applied to the investigated joints. The nominal stress range approach can not provide a satisfactory prediction of the fatigue strength of novel welded joints because the local geometrical details including structural geometry and weld geometry are implicitly embedded in the nominal design SN curves. Laboratory tests would hence be needed to establish nominal stress approaches. More refined local approaches including the structural stress range approach and the notch stress range approach have been developed for a more accurate assessment of the fatigue strength. The main challenge for these local approaches is to find suitable stress calculation methods in the vicinity of the weld and thereby the uncertainties that determine the fatigue strength of the joint can be quantitatively reflected in a local stress concentration factor. Several of these methods are applied in the study of novel types of welded aluminium joints in this thesis. The choice of design SN curves must be consistent with the way by which the design stress range is calculated. Fatigue test data support the use of a structural stress design SN curve of fatigue class 40 for the fatigue assessment of aluminium fillet welded in-plane bracket connections when the structural stress has been derived from the extrapolation methods. It has been shown that a structural stress design SN curve of fatigue class 44 for the fatigue assessment of aluminium lap joints can be used. Another important issue is to investigate the effect of the local weld geometry such as the weld toe angle, weld toe radius, and weld leg length on the value of the structural/notch stress and accordingly on fatigue behaviour. The weld parameters of the joints have been measured in the laboratory and the statistical measured values are used in the numerical finite element models (FEM). Improving fatigue strength of critical joints is found to be necessary late in the design process or during the service time of a structure to extend the whole service life of the structure. The effect of weld toe grinding on the stress concentration at the weld toe is studied by finite element analysis (FEA). Fatigue tests show that the fatigue life in terms of number of cycles to failure is nearly doubled by simply grinding the weld toe of the joint. However, the standard deviations are not so much affected as the fatigue strength. The effect of weld parameters such as the grinding depth has been found to play a decisive role in fatigue life improvement. </p...|$|E
40|$|Aluminium is a {{material}} commonly used for smaller boats and high speed crafts {{due to its}} low weight. Traditionally the hull construction is performed {{in a similar manner}} as that of steel ships, with longitudinal stiffeners fitted through cut-outs in the transverse web frames and welded to the shell plating. This requires much fitting and welding, making the production of hulls a slow and expensive task due to the manual labour needed. An alternative method for construction of aluminium hulls is to extrude panels consisting of both the shell plating and stiffener. These pre-fabricated panels are then welded directly to the transverse frames, thus reducing the manual labour related to hull production significantly. This thesis continues the work previously performed by Jon Englund on floating panels. He found that the stresses will increase significantly in a floating frame structure compared to that of a traditional, fixed structure. It was discovered that the main challenge of a floating frame structure is out-of-plane bending stresses occurring in the stiffeners webs due to frame deflections. By use of finite element analyses and analytical calculations, a compartment of the JumboCat 60 is analysed, and proposals for achieving acceptable stresses are given. The stiffener stresses mentioned above are found to be drastically reduced by increasing the bending- and axial stiffness of the transverse web frames. Local stress concentrations are found in the intersection between stiffener and <b>web</b> <b>frame.</b> Nonlinear finite element analyses show that substantial strain-hardening can be achieved in the stiffeners webs through cyclic loading. The loss of strength due to welding may thus be partly recovered. </p...|$|E

The stated {{aim of the research}} is to seek to identify key features of the developers' requirements for methodologies and then from this, to design a framework for use in practice. The literature review reveals that a great many methodologies are available but recent research also suggests that these are poorly used in practice. This study explores {{whether or not this is}} so and if so, why. Using an interpretevist epistemological framework the principles of Grounded Theory Methodology are used to conduct a mixed methods investigation. Structuration Theory offers a theoretical framework for analysis and development of the theory. An initial web-based survey aims to capture a breadth of developers' views and experiences. This is then followed with semi-structured interviews which enables exploration of the area in depth. The findings suggest that web information system developers are not following a published methodology but prefer instead to develop their own 'bespoke' approach to suit the project. The developers seem to be aware of, and are using, traditional information system tools and importing them as appropriate into the web development methodologies. They are however, less aware or concerned with published web methodologies apparently needing greater flexibility and choice for developing web information systems than the published methodologies offer. Thus, the proposed new framework (entitled <b>WEB</b> <b>FRAME)</b> aims to provide web developers with a set of key principles to facilitate development of web information system development methodologies. This proposed framework is evaluated and validated by an expert panel of web developers with findings from this evaluation and validation reported here.

40|$|Fatigue {{prediction}} of ships {{is always a}} challenge. For container ships, that which, by default, are sensitive to fatigue because of their large deck openings and because of their operating in the extreme conditions of the North Atlantic, this prediction is even harder to make. Further studies are trying {{to establish a new}} method that can predict possible material failure in a more effective way. This study aims at performing stochastic fatigue analyses using a finite element model of a 4, 400 TEU container ship according to the procedure of DNV software SESAM. These analyses could become a basis for the comparison of results between the standard method of fatigue prediction and a new simplified method. The analysis contains frequency domain hydrodynamic simulation, linear elastic structural analysis and stochastic fatigue analysis. The finite element (FE) model of the entire ship indicated several regions where severe fatigue damage is expected. One of these areas was chosen to be represented by a more detailed FE model. The bilge in the midship region was considered most critical because being under the waterline level, cracks are not easily noticed. This local submodel indicated that the highest fatigue damage is located at the connection of transverse web frames with the double side. A detailed FE model represents the double side with a transverse <b>web</b> <b>frame</b> and cut-outs for longitudinal stiffeners. From this analysis, the largest damage is expected at the cut-outs. The hotspot method, according to DNV recommendations, was used to obtain stress concentration factors at two points, which are then applied to the fatigue analysis of the global FE model of the entire ship. The stochastic fatigue analysis of the detailed FE model gives unrealistically high fatigue damage for some local areas. The assumptions and limitations {{of this study suggest that}} the resulting fatigue damage will be overestimated, although they cannot explain this extent of overestimation. Stress concentration factors and SN-curves are therefore examined as for how modifications in their values affect the results...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{behaviour}} of the x-core double-hull design {{was investigated in}} various collision situations between two RORO vessels and compared to a conventional double-hull design using explicit finite element analysis. The purpose was, besides {{the examination of the}} x-core structure’s increased crashworthiness, to investigate how different parameters influence the collision simulations. From this, recommendations were deduced on how to model future simulations most effectively. To achieve this, geometry models of both doublehulls and a striking bow section were created from CAD-data and drawings. The material model of a regular-strength shipbuilding steel was extended with the GL-approach describing a constant effective plastic failure strain, the PES-criterion describing a failure strain being dependent on sheet thicknesses of the shell model and mean edge lengths of the elements, and the RTCL-criterion accounting for triaxiality and introducing a damage variable. The RTCLcriterion was calibrated with simulated tensile tests. Collision simulations were carried out at two different draughts, hitting on a <b>web</b> <b>frame</b> and between two web frames, respectively. The collision angle was varied from the perpendicular angle to the struck hull to a 15 degrees inclination, and the influence of dynamic friction was examined. The conventional hull’s level of detail was reduced and the x-core’s mesh was coarsened and the resulting savings in time and errors in absorbed energy were examined. It was found that the x-core structure shows the potential to provide a higher crashworthiness than the conventionally used hull. The PES-criterion responded well to changing sheet thicknesses, while the GL-approach and the RTCL-criterion were totally and virtually independent of them, respectively. Collisions from the inclined direction yielded higher energies than from the perpendicular one, which showed Minorsky’s method to be inaccurate for this kind of collision. A comparison between results obtained from simulations regarding and disregarding friction showed only minor differences in the behaviour of folding structures and none in the absorbed energies. Simplification of the conventional double-hull and coarsening of the mesh of the x-core double-hull showed that the PES-criterion yielded the best compromise between reduction of calculation time and introduced error in this investigation...|$|E
40|$|The {{northern}} {{areas are}} becoming more and more attractive because off the large oil and gas reservoir that is there. In this area there is a harsh environment and the possibility to collide with an iceberg increases as the number of vessels in the area increases. The project is a master thesis that was trying to find appropriate shapes of the contact area of an iceberg in relation with the ship scantlings that can be used for design against iceberg impacts. This thesis investigated an accident with a return period of 10 000 years, which correspond to an ALS (accidental limit state) type of event. This type of event allows for some plastic deformation in the structure as long as it does not danger human life, have significant pollution or financial consequences. By dividing the calculation in two, first by calculation of the energy in the iceberg relative to the ship and then impose the energy in a collision with the ship. To simulate the collision between the ship and the iceberg there were used non-linear finite element method by using the computer code LS-DYNA 971. The ship structure and iceberg were modeled in PATRAN with shell elements for the ship and solid elements for the iceberg. The icebergs were modeled as a cone with a radius in front where the angle of the cone and radius of the front were varied. The ice material was modeled with a material model that was developed by an earlier Phd. student at NTNU. This corresponds to a shared energy design of the ship according the NORSOK codes three categories. The three categories are ductile design, shared energy design and strength design. The shipside scantlings was also varied with a ship without ice strengthening, a 1 C ice strengthened ship and a 1 A ice strengthened ship. The ship structure was limited to only a section of the shipside modeled with an elasto-plastic material model. In the analysis the iceberg was pushed into the shipside with a constant speed and the forces, deformations and pressures were measured. The result was showing a tendency of that an iceberg with the largest radius in front equal to half of the <b>web</b> <b>frame</b> spacing and a cone angle higher than about 50 degrees was the most onerous for the shipside, but were not tested any icebergs with larger radius. </p...|$|E

40|$|Failure of {{ballast tank}} {{coatings}} {{is an increasing}} problem in today’s shipping industry. The consequences of coating failures (fracture) are corrosion of the steel {{which can lead to}} early occurrence of fatigue cracks and fast fatigue crack propagation. Inspections of coatings in water ballast tanks of ships have shown that fracture of many coatings occurs earlier than their design life (which is around 8 - 12 years), although the coatings have been maintained regularly and properly. From a financial perspective, maintenance and repair of a coating is very expensive (810 million USD for the US marine shipping industry in 2006) and should be reduced. This can be achieved by better methods that can assist in the identification of critical locations in water ballast tanks regarding coating failure. With such a method, the preparation for maintenance and repair procedures can be made more efficiently. The aim of this thesis is to suggest a method (simulation procedure) which can be used to identify local areas inside a ballast tank where coating fracture may occur as a result of large strains and ageing of the coating’s mechanical properties. The methodology proposed is to use a finite element sub-modelling technique that involves full ship analysis to find local areas which thereafter are refined to better represent ballast tank areas and locations with high strain levels. These areas are then modelled into more detailed local models in order to perform non-linear finite element analyses where the ship steel is allowed to exceed its yield stress in e. g. cut-outs. Fracture of a coating is assumed to occur when the strain level of the ship steel exceeds the fracture strain of the aged coating. Different sea state conditions are simulated where the significant wave height, the wave heading angle and the ship’s speed are varied. Six different local areas are studied in detail with regard to the strain response of the steel (substrate). The computed strains in the substrate are compared against fracture strains of un-aged and aged water ballast tank coating samples from uniaxial tensile tests. The results show that the strain in the substrate exceeds the fracture strain of aged coatings in several locations, i. e. the coating will fracture. The most critical areas and locations of the case study vessel are {{at the bottom of the}} ballast tank, in the cut-outs that intersect a longitudinal stiffener and a transverse <b>web</b> <b>frame.</b> It is concluded that the method proposed is suitable for finding local areas where the strain of the substrate exceeds the fracture strain of the coating. It is also concluded that high mesh density in local details is necessary in this method in order to carry out realistic simulations and resolve the strain gradients in cut-out details and thereby be able to compare strains in the substrate with coating fracture strains...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{wave and}} other loadings, the {{connections}} between longitudinals and transverse members of ship's side shell structure become vulnerable to cracking. The main objective of the studies carried out in this thesis was to identify the occurrence of cracks in a stiffened plate model representing the ship's side shell structure. [...] Based on analysis using a finite element program package, a one-twentieth aluminum stiffened plate model of a tanker ship's side shell structure was designed. Three models were fabricated; the models were tested using random excitation forces whose dominant frequency was far separated <≈ 2 Hz) from the first natural frequency of the models <≈ 580 Hz) under intact and 8 (eight) damaged conditions. These damages occurred at flange(s) and web(s) of the model's longitudinal(s). In damage cases # 1 to # 4, the damage occurred at a longitudinal in {{the connections between}} the longitudinal and bulkheads while in damage cases # 5 to # 8, damage the intersections of longitudinals and a <b>web</b> <b>frame.</b> Using the model's responses obtained from finite element analysis the best accelerometer and strain gage locations were determined. Output-only modal analysis was implemented in the experimental investigations; random decrement method and Ibrahim time domain identification technique were employed to extract modal parameters. [...] Natural frequencies, root mean square (rms) of acceleration and strain response and amplitudes of {{a function of the}} natural frequency, the damping ratio and free response (which was called Dn in this study) obtained from numerical and experimental investigations were compared. Although natural frequencies, the rms and the Dn amplitude values computed from the results of numerical investigations were different from those obtained from the experimental investigations, most of them had similar trends due to increasing crack lengths. [...] Damage identification schemes for on-line and off-line identification of cracks, using the rms of acceleration and strain response and the amplitude of Dn function, were presented. Using these values a damage indicator was proposed. It was demonstrated that the schemes could identify the crack locations and lengths. In the first scheme, a damage indicator was computed from the rms of acceleration and strain response obtained from numerical and experimental investigations. To estimate the damage indicator values as cracks increased in length an algebraic function was developed and used. It was observed that the difference between the actual and extrapolated damage indicator values was a maximum of 18. 63 %. Crack lengths could also be estimated by employing the function along with an iteration procedure using assumed damage indicator value as initial value and defined error tolerance. Very good results were obtained; a maximum error of 3 % was observed. Another damage identification scheme using numerically computed rms response to obtain crack length and location was also presented. This scheme can be categorized as a nomogram technique. It is shown that the scheme can be used to identify accurately the extent and the location of cracks occurring in the horizontal's flange and web with maximum error of 2 %. [...] The amplitude of Dn function was also examined to assess damage in the investigated model. The function was obtained utilizing a neural network technique. While the modal frequencies decreased and modal damping ratios did not have definable trend as the crack lengths grew, the Dn amplitudes changed consistently as a results of cracks occurring at one location. A damage indicator was also computed from the amplitudes of Dn function, for different damage cases. The algebraic function developed earlier was also employed to extrapolate the damage indicator values for subsequent damage cases with assumed crack lengths and locations. In addition, the function was also employed to estimate the crack sizes for known damage indicator values. The scheme produced promising results with a maximum error of about 11 %...|$|E
40|$|Esta tesis {{doctoral}} es una investigación cuantitativa y cualitativa, descriptiva y analítica, basada en el método de análisis de contenido, que tiene por objeto de estudio el contenido que los periodistas profesionales españoles difunden en Twitter. El propósito del estudio es describir ese contenido, analizarlo e inferir de ello determinadas tendencias. Se pretende hallar en tales tendencias indicaciones relativas a la consideración del papel de Twitter por parte de los periodistas en el proceso de cambio general que experimenta el periodismo en el marco de la Red. Ello podría ayudar a advertir indicios de actividad innovadora en la Red por parte de los autores de los tuits que forman el corpus de la investigación. En la investigación se utiliza el método de análisis de contenido desarrollado por Berelson, Holsti y Krippendorff introduciendo algunas adaptaciones metodológicas y técnicas al aplicarlo a un objeto de estudio que se da en una determinación tecnológica muy distinta a la usual {{en el momento}} que fue creado aquel método: las redes sociales de internet. Por ello, la tesis pretende aportar algunas innovaciones metodológicas al respecto que puedan ajustar las metodologías establecidas en el estudio de los medios de comunicación de masas a las nuevas y cambiantes realidades que presentan las redes sociales de internet en el contexto y evolución de la Web 2. 0. La hipótesis principal propone que los periodistas españoles publican en Twitter contenido de distinta naturaleza según trabajen en medios masivos o en cibermedios. La diferencia denota distintos posicionamientos respecto al papel de Internet en las tareas periodísticas. Tales tendencias implican prioridades distintas en el abordaje de la actualidad, así como determinadas concepciones de la profesión y la Red. El trabajo de campo alcanza el análisis de 3. 500 tuits y 350 portadas de periódicos, que corresponden, los primeros, a dos muestras formadas por 20 cuentas de Twitter de otros tantos periodistas, y las segundas, a una muestra compuesta de cinco diarios de referencia publicados en Barcelona y Madrid. El seguimiento de las muestras ha sido realizado durante siete días, no consecutivos y en semanas escalonadas, lo que supone un contexto de actualidad comprendido en el marco temporal de siete semanas. Las conclusiones de la tesis apuntan a la relación entre el periodismo español de ahora y las expectativas de innovación del mismo en los nuevos escenarios de la Red. The actual {{doctoral thesis}} is a quantitative and qualitative, descriptive and analytic research, based in the content analysis method, whose object is the content that professional spanish journalists spread through Twitter. The purpose {{of this research is}} describying that content, analyzing it and deduce from it certain tendences. The aim is to find in them data referring to the way how journalists considere Twitter’s role amid the general change process that journalism is suffering in the <b>Web</b> <b>frame.</b> Tendences and data could help to find traces of innovating activity in the Web shown by the senders of tweets analyzed from the research corpus. In this research the content analysis method developed by Berelson, Holsti and Krippendorff is used, introducing some methodological and technical adaptations {{due to the fact that}} the object of study is given in a dramatically different technological determination that the prevailing in the time when analysis content method was created: the internet’s social networks. For that reason this thesis would introduce some methodological innovations on that subject that could update the established methodologies used in the study of mass media communications and adapt them to the new and changing realities shown by the internet’s social networks in the frame and evolution of the Web 2. 0. Tha main hypothesis of the research proposes that the spanish journalists publish on Twitter diferent nature of content either they work in mass media or cybermedia. That difference indicates different stances concerning the role of Internet in newsmaking. These stances mean different priorities in the approach of current affairs, just like certain considerations on the journalism and the Net. The field work includes an analysis of 3. 500 tweets and 350 journals front pages, belonging either to two samples composed by 20 Twitter accounts corresponding to the same amount of journalists and one sample composed by five reference daily newspapers published in Barcelona and Madrid. The following of these samples has been carried out during seven days, non consecutive and in staggered weeks, what means a frame of seven weeks period of current issues. The summation of the thesis shows a relation between the current journalism as is practiced in Spain and the innovation expectations in the new scenes in the Net...|$|E
5000|$|Short and stubby icebreakers are {{generally}} built using transverse framing {{in which the}} shell plating is stiffened with frames placed about 400 to 1000 mm apart as opposed to longitudinal framing used in longer ships. Near the waterline, the frames running in vertical direction distribute the local ice loads on the shell plating to longitudinal girders called stringers, which in turn are supported by <b>web</b> <b>frames</b> and bulkheads that carry the global hull loads. While the shell plating, which is {{in direct contact with}} the ice, can be up to 50 mm thick in older polar icebreakers, the use of high strength steel with yield strength up to [...] in modern icebreakers results in the same structural strength with smaller material thicknesses and lower steel weight. Regardless of the strength, the steel used in the hull structures of an icebreaker must be capable of resisting brittle fracture in low ambient temperatures and high loading conditions, both of which are typical for operations in ice-filled waters.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how segregationists fused traditional frame arguments with Cold War geopolitics {{to defend the}} South’s racial hierarchy and white supremacist ideology. For social movements, ideology’s power is its capacity to weave seemingly disparate cultural perspectives of deep historical roots together with more contemporary concerns and reorient them into a <b>web</b> of <b>frame</b> arguments serving the core logic for collective action. As the intellectual architecture of a movement’s cosmology, the frame constellation is the entire interlocking <b>web</b> of <b>frames</b> as defined by core ideology. Its structure is comprised of multiple frame clusters that are regional assemblages in the constellation of frames organized around a central subject as related to the movement’s ideological nucleus. Within frame clusters are frame sub-clusters, which are relatively smaller numbers of tightly interconnected frame arguments structuring the larger frame cluster theme as related to movement ideology. Frame arguments then, are basic units of a movement’s ideological thrust. In this research white supremacist ideology functions as the gravitational center around which all thematic arguments orbit in the segregationist frame constellation; a dynamism characterized by interrelated, overlapping and intersecting notions which operate for the singular purpose of defending the segregationist vision of the cosmos...|$|R
