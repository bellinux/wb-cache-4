60|$|She stopped exactly {{opposite}} to Valentine; and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> she looked on him alone.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned her}} head and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> and replied, her voice was rather hard.|$|E
60|$|Flora {{turned her}} head for a moment, but <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> again her eyes shone.|$|E
5000|$|When Olivia sees {{a bowl of}} oranges she discovers she has {{a hidden}} talent for juggling. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> throws four oranges in the air they disappear. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up,</b> <b>she</b> realizes Ian who is {{standing}} on the stairs above her has caught them.|$|R
5000|$|As Spike {{heads off}} {{to look for}} Dana, Angel follows Lorne's {{suggestion}} to visit Dana's childhood home with a psychic. The psychic flashes back to Dana’s abduction and her family’s murder; the smell of molasses and a basement is “where her pain lives,” he says. Meanwhile, Dana goes to {{the basement of the}} building where she was held captive, flashing back to her torturer injecting her with various drugs. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> at his face, it’s Spike.|$|R
2500|$|In a 2009 interview, Bai {{claimed that}} she is from the moon, where her {{grandmother}} lives. [...] "I'm not really in reality. I'm in my own universe and my mind is a million miles somewhere else," [...] she stated, further explaining, [...] "Why I feel like I come from the moon is because {{my mother told me}} I was found somewhere." [...] <b>She</b> believes that <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> at the moon, she can often spot her grandmother there, still living in her childhood home.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} Betty turned her head, but <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> again she was calm and businesslike.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> {{her eyes}} met the fixed stare of Razumov, {{who began to}} speak at once.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> her {{substitute}} {{was lost}} in the undulating mass below, and for her the spectacle was over.|$|E
5000|$|Back in Salamanca Teresa {{finds the}} region {{suffering}} a drought [...] "for four years now," [...] {{as a woman}} tells her - ever since the statue of Mary disappeared. Bidding farewell to Flaco, Teresa enters the chapel she'd left so long ago and prays. Weeping, she prostrates herself {{on the floor as}} the Blessed Virgin enters, pauses to bless her, and then returns to the pedestal that had been for so long vacant. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up,</b> Teresa finds the statue returned to its pedestal and gazes on it in awe.|$|R
50|$|One night Horacio is {{smoking in}} his room when he sees Talita {{crossing}} the moonlit garden below, apparently heading to bed. A moment later, he thinks he sees La Maga appear and begin a game of hopscotch in the same general area; but <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> at him, he realizes it is Talita, who had turned and recrossed the garden. A kind of guilt, fed {{in part by the}} institution's gloomy atmosphere, begins to steal into his musings, and it is not long before he conceives of the idea of someone's trying to murder him while he is on duty—perhaps Traveler.|$|R
60|$|Kate {{was alone}} <b>when</b> I entered. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> quickly as I opened the door, {{and turned away}} {{disappointed}} <b>when</b> <b>she</b> recognized me.|$|R
60|$|She {{gave him}} a quick glance, {{and for a moment}} turned her head. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> her colour was rather high.|$|E
60|$|Aunt Em {{had just}} come out of the house to water the {{cabbages}} <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> and saw Dorothy running toward her.|$|E
60|$|Carrie said nothing, but {{the firelight}} {{was on her}} face <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> at her husband, and once more he was satisfied.|$|E
50|$|Posing as a prostitute, Vanessa steals a {{car from}} a {{prospective}} john and drives to her grandmother's house. Vanessa finds Bob in bed wearing her grandmother's nightgown and nightcap with the covers {{pulled up to}} his nose. Bob reveals himself and Vanessa sees her grandmother's body on the floor. A struggle ensues, culminating in Vanessa strangling Bob. Detectives Breer and Wallace arrive and approach the trailer with their guns drawn when they hear the commotion inside. Vanessa eventually exits the trailer exhausted after her struggle and the detectives enter to find Bob and Vanessa's grandmother both dead. Outside, Vanessa sits in a chair, near her breaking point, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> and asks the detectives {{if they have a}} cigarette. They smile and Vanessa responds in kind.|$|R
5000|$|Months {{go by and}} Mrs Rymer becomes {{good friends}} with Joe Welsh, a widowed farmhand. They enjoy the lambing season in Spring, walks in the Summer and the harvest in October. It is on the eighth of that month, and almost a year has passed since her new life started, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> from her work in the {{vegetable}} patch and sees Pyne watching her from over a fence. She starts to curse him and he admits to all the deceptions. He agrees that Hannah Moorhouse never existed and tells her that Mrs Gardner is in on the act. Pyne has had Mrs Rymer's power of attorney {{for the past year}} and her fortune has been safe and actually improved in the interim. He asks her a simple question: [...] "Are you happy?" ...|$|R
60|$|The church-bells were ringing <b>when</b> he came. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> in keen {{anticipation}} at his entry. But he {{was troubled}} and his pride was hurt. He seemed very much clothed, she {{was conscious of}} his tailored suit.|$|R
6000|$|Belle didn't see him flush and frown as {{she made}} her confession, and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> he only said, half gratefully, half reproachfully,-- ...|$|E
60|$|But Katherine, {{whose face}} {{was buried in}} the {{cushions}} of the lounge, did not hear him and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> he was gone.|$|E
60|$|Anna sat silent a moment, {{wondering}} what he meant; and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> {{she found him}} pensively staring at her, through a fragrant cloud of smoke.|$|E
50|$|Soon after, an {{attractive}} young Australian girl named Raylene Miles {{arrives at the}} hotel, which creates a similar situation for Basil to that which Johnson created for Sybil. Basil handles his attractive character quite differently however. While Sybil openly flirts with Johnson, Basil tries too hard to ensure he appears uninterested, such as looking at her and then glancing away <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up.</b> This makes him nervous and he begins to act as though he does fancy her, via Freudian slips or luckless accidents. One such accident occurs while repairing Raylene's bathroom light: he reaches around a corner for the switch and, as Raylene is stretching beside the door, instead accidentally tweaks her nipple rather than the switch. Of course, Sybil steps in and sees this, leading her to believe Basil is softly groping her. Sybil does not react by insulting Raylene as Basil had with Johnson, but rather to berate Basil, and to apologise to her afterwards.|$|R
6000|$|He was {{standing}} with his face towards the door, and as Dinah entered, lifting up her mild grey eyes towards him, she saw at once the great change that had come since the day <b>when</b> <b>she</b> had <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> at the tall man in the cottage. There was a trembling in her clear voice as {{she put her hand}} into his and said, [...] "Be comforted, Adam Bede, the Lord has not forsaken her." ...|$|R
60|$|And <b>when</b> <b>she</b> could <b>look</b> <b>up</b> <b>she</b> did, {{and there}} was Robert himself close behind, smiling at her eagerness, <b>looking</b> better than <b>she</b> had ever seen him look--looking, indeed, to her partial eyes, so very {{handsome}} that she dared not trust herself to hazard a second glance; for his image struck on her vision with painful brightness, and pictured itself on her memory as vividly as if there daguerreotyped by a pencil of keen lightning.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Pasmer read it, {{not only}} without indignation, but {{apparently}} without displeasure. But, she understood perfectly what the trouble was, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> and asked, cheerfully, [...] "Well?" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{turned her}} head aside, and <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> again I {{saw that she was}} weeping, really weeping this time, not just making her eyes swim, as she did before.|$|E
6000|$|Her eyes {{fell and}} {{her right hand}} slowly turned the mug around and around. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> she seemed older {{and her eyes were}} sadder. [...] "That need make no difference." ...|$|E
6000|$|In a {{very few}} minutes she was back. Her {{appearance}} might have frightened some people, for she was clad only in a shroud. Her feet were bare, and she walked across {{the room with the}} gait of an empress, and stood before me with her eyes modestly cast down. But <b>when</b> presently <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> and caught my eyes, a smile rippled over her face. She threw herself once more before me on her knees, and embraced me as she said: ...|$|R
60|$|She {{bent forward}} until {{her face was}} {{completely}} hidden. Her body was shaken. Once or twice he fancied that her laughter had turned to sobs. <b>When</b> at last <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up,</b> however, there were the remains of an almost devilish mirth on her lips. She rang the bell.|$|R
6000|$|The guest sat {{looking at}} her as he smoked out his final cigarette, and as she sat with her head bent over her work, with an {{expression}} that might have resolved her doubts, and brought her to a lasting conclusion {{on the subject of}} his good or bad <b>looks</b> if <b>she</b> had seen it. <b>When</b> <b>she</b> did <b>look</b> <b>up,</b> the expression was not there. The hand was smoothing his shaggy moustache. 'May one ask to be shown to bed, madame?' ...|$|R
60|$|Sophy paused {{until she}} had lit a cigarette. The {{expression}} in her face, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> at John, irritated him vaguely. It {{was as if she}} were talking to a child.|$|E
60|$|She {{covered her}} face with her hands for a moment. If indeed she really felt any emotion it passed quickly away, for <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> again there were no traces left.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> {{from her}} task, presently, {{he was sitting}} {{in the shade of the}} cedar, {{watching}} her. He had the expression of a man who hardly believed what he saw.|$|E
5000|$|Play Now {{tries to}} {{negotiate}} with George, but he won't give in. Later, he offers his office and one of their rubber balls to allow Kramer to test his oil tanker bladder idea. The big test takes place at George's workplace where Jerry plans to meet Claire. They quickly notice and try to warn her about the falling rubber ball of oil, but all she hears is [...] "the voice" [...] from Jerry and won't listen; <b>when</b> <b>she</b> finally <b>looks</b> <b>up,</b> it's too late.|$|R
60|$|The sharp hiss {{the steel}} runners made was louder, the wind began to scream, {{and she got}} {{something}} of a shock <b>when</b> <b>she</b> cautiously <b>looked</b> <b>up.</b> It {{was hard to see}} through the snowy spray, but the top of the crag looked ominously near. Glancing down hill with smarting eyes, she thought the slope, which, from the top, had seemed to fall evenly to the dale, was also inclined towards the crag. She could not see much of the latter, but there was a fringe of dark rock where the white declivity broke off.|$|R
60|$|Lucille moved {{a little}} away from me, and I {{could not see}} her face, for <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> back towards the train of cars which came clanking down the track; but for once words were given me, and <b>when</b> I ceased, <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> again. Though the rich damask had deepened in her cheek, there was a {{significant}} question in her eyes.|$|R
