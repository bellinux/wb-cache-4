5|$|About 222million <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> {{to avoid}} {{pregnancy}} {{in developing countries}} are not using a modern birth control method. Birth control use in developing countries has decreased {{the number of deaths}} during or around the time of pregnancy by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% if the full demand for birth control were met. By lengthening the time between pregnancies, birth control can improve adult women's delivery outcomes and the survival of their children. In the developing world women's earnings, assets, weight, and their children's schooling and health all improve with greater access to birth control. Birth control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children, more women participating in the workforce, and less use of scarce resources.|$|E

25|$|Garson Romalis (October 23, 1937 – January 31, 2014) was a Canadian {{gynecologist}} {{who specialized}} in providing abortions. (See Abortion in Canada.) He was twice wounded in attempts on his life. The first attempt on his life {{was by far the}} most violent antiabortion crime in Canada, according to the National Post. The second attempt was made by an unknown assailant who stabbed him and fled. Since being personally attacked, Romalis became more outspoken and more determined to provide abortions to <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> them. As such, he was a notable public figure in the Canadian abortion debate. The University of Toronto Law School invited him to speak at their Symposium to mark the 20th Anniversary of R. vs. Morgentaler. He worked to convince medical students of the need to continue providing abortions.|$|E
25|$|The National Public Radio investigative {{report on}} Acu-Gen {{predicted}} that parents {{may use the}} Baby Gender Mentor test {{as a basis for}} determining whether to get a sex-selective abortion. KMSP-TV interviewed genetic counselor Dr. Analia Bortz who made the same prediction. The concern is that learning the sex at such an early point may lead parents to terminate the pregnancy if they were hoping for a baby of the opposite sex to that indicated by the test. Americans United for Life argues that women disappointed by the result of their test would find it easier to have an abortion if they get the results early. They say that <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> to have a specific sex will be learning the results {{at a time when it}} is safer for them to have an abortion, without the complications associated with aborting later in pregnancy.|$|E

25|$|If a cone biopsy {{does not}} produce clear margins (findings on biopsy showing that the tumor is {{surrounded}} by cancer free tissue, suggesting all of the tumor is removed), one more possible treatment option for <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> to preserve their fertility is a trachelectomy. This attempts to surgically remove the cancer while preserving the ovaries and uterus, providing for a more conservative operation than a hysterectomy. It is a viable option for those in stage I cervical cancer which has not spread; however, {{it is not yet}} considered a standard of care, as few doctors are skilled in this procedure. Even the most experienced surgeon cannot promise that a trachelectomy can be performed until after surgical microscopic examination, as the extent of the spread of cancer is unknown. If the surgeon is not able to microscopically confirm clear margins of cervical tissue once the woman is under general anesthesia in the operating room, a hysterectomy may still be needed. This can only be done during the same operation if the woman has given prior consent. Due to the possible risk of cancer spread to the lymph nodes in stage 1b cancers and some stage 1a cancers, the surgeon may also need to remove some lymph nodes from around the uterus for pathologic evaluation.|$|E

500|$|On 29 March 1928, when a bill {{came before}} {{parliament}} giving {{the vote in}} parliamentary elections to all men and women over 21, she termed the measure [...] "a tremendous social advance", and added: [...] "At last [...] are established on that equitable footing because we are human beings and part of society as a whole... once and for all, we shall destroy the artificial barrier {{in the way of}} any <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> to get education in politics and who want to come forward and take their full share in the political life of their day". When the bill became law, 4 million voters, most of them women, were added to the register. In the 1929 general election, held on 30 May, Bondfield easily held her Wallsend seat despite the intervention of a candidate representing unemployed workers. The overall election result left Labour as the largest party with 287 seats, but without an overall majority, and MacDonald formed his second minority administration.|$|E

500|$|In 1999, {{as part of}} a new storyline, Sable was {{attacked}} by a masked woman named Spider Lady, {{who turned out to be}} Luna. Sable defeated Luna in a Strap match at the Royal Rumble after an assist from a planted female Sable fan, WWF newcomer Tori. Tori's debut signified a change in Sable's persona. After the Rumble, Rena (under her Sable ring name) was featured as the cover girl for the April 1999 issue of Playboy. The issue was one of the highest selling issues of Playboy ever. Surrounding the release of the issue, the Sable character turned heel by [...] "going Hollywood" [...] and having an inflated ego. Rarely defending her title, Sable continually berated her fan Tori, and she feuded with both Tori and Luna Vachon (who had turned face). She debuted a new catchphrase: [...] "This is for all the <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> to be me and all the men who come to see me" [...] and a dance move called [...] "the grind." [...] The feud with Tori led to a match at WrestleMania XV. During the contest, Nicole Bass debuted as Sable's bodyguard and helped Sable win the match.|$|E
500|$|Falle took a {{sustained}} interest in Bedford v. Canada, {{a case that}} began in the fall of 2010 when laws against keeping a brothel, communicating in order to facilitate prostitution, and living off the avails of prostitution were struck down by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice as unconstitutional. When Falle first heard about this decision, she cried, and expressed surprise and disappointment. She said that she did not believe that the average Canadian realized the implications of striking down these laws, which she said were that [...] "your next door neighbours can run a brothel right beside you. Your children could be exposed to condoms left on their driveway, johns propositioning them." [...] She also expressed her concern that striking down anti-prostitution laws normalizes prostitution as a career option for children to consider. She also said that, without the laws, [...] "pimps will be legitimate businesspeople [...] billboards advertising brothels could start appearing on roadsides." [...] Ron Marzel, a lawyer attempting to have the anti-prostitution laws declared unconstitutional, said, [...] "the reality is there are consenting adults who want to go into" [...] prostitution. Falle was angered by this statement, and replied that 97% of women in the sex industry are not engaging in prostitution by choice, and that [...] "the voices of the overwhelming majority of <b>women</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> to get out of prostitution are being drowned out by a vocal few." ...|$|E

[...] Along with this is a similar rise in the risk of emergency hysterectomies at delivery.|$|E
2500|$|In a July 1995 {{interview}} with Playboy magazine, Gibson said President Bill Clinton was a [...] "low-level opportunist" [...] and someone was [...] "telling {{him what to}} do".

Gibson later backed away from such conspiracy theories saying, [...] "It was like: 'Hey, tell us a conspiracy'...so I laid out this thing, and suddenly, it was like I was talking the gospel truth, espousing all this political shit like I believed in it."
