25|$|Shane Warne {{continued}} {{after lunch}} {{by taking the}} wicket of Kevin Pietersen for 14. Andrew Flintoff emerged to form a vital partnership of 143 with Andrew Strauss, before to falling to Glenn McGrath for 72 an hour after tea. Strauss made his 2nd century of the series, before being dismissed by Shane Warne off an acrobatic catch by Simon Katich. The day ended with Geraint Jones and Ashley Giles at the crease, with England 319 for 7. Certain forecasts for London called for showers sometime during the weekend, which, it was thought, might <b>wipe</b> <b>up</b> to a day of action or more from the ledger.|$|E
2500|$|Vice Admiral William P. Mack {{recalled}} {{the antics of}} the diminutive vice chief: [...] "He would grab three-star officers by the lapels, literally shake them, and say, 'Why don't you do so and so or such and such?' They'd be thirty or forty pounds heavier than he was, but that didn't bother him at all. He was there for two years, which was probably about a year too long, because morale was getting pretty low. As I told Admiral Burke, {{it was just a}} matter of time before someone was going to slug him. You can't operate like that. Admiral Felt wasn't big enough to defend himself. I said that one of these days he's going to come at someone who's going to <b>wipe</b> <b>up</b> the corridor with him, regardless of how many stars he has." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, The Deer Hunter was {{not without}} {{critical}} backlash. Pauline Kael of The New Yorker wrote a positive review with some reservations: [...] " [...] a small minded film with greatness in it... with an enraptured view of common life... enraging, because, despite its ambitiousness and scale, it has no more moral intelligence than the Eastwood action pictures." [...] Andrew Sarris wrote that the film was [...] "massively vague, tediously elliptical, and mysteriously hysterical... It is perhaps significant that the actors remain {{more interesting than the}} characters they play." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum disparaged The Deer Hunter as an [...] "Oscar-laden weepie about macho buddies" [...] and [...] "a disgusting account of what the evil Vietnamese did to poor, innocent Americans". John Simon of New York wrote: [...] "For all its pretensions to something newer and better, this film is only an extension of the old Hollywood war-movie lie. The enemy is still bestial and stupid, and no match for our purity and heroism; only we no longer <b>wipe</b> <b>up</b> the floor with him—rather, we litter it with his guts." ...|$|E
5000|$|Hisamatsu {{states it}} more bluntly: From the Zen perspective, scriptures {{are nothing but}} scraps of paper for <b>wiping</b> <b>up</b> filth.|$|R
50|$|Cheesecloth {{can also}} be used for several printmaking {{processes}} including lithography for <b>wiping</b> <b>up</b> gum arabic. In intaglio a heavily starched cheesecloth called tarlatan is used for wiping away excess ink from the printing surface.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fire 'em, most likely, {{and they}} deserve to be fired," [...] growled Stanley. [...] "Oh, when I think of the trick that was played I feel like <b>wiping</b> <b>up</b> the floor with {{every one of those}} scoundrels!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let's {{go down to}} the old mill after him," [...] {{burst out}} Tom. [...] "I'd like nothing better than to <b>wipe</b> <b>up</b> the ground with him." [...] And he clenched his fists tightly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tommy told me {{that they}} had not less than a dozen {{first-class}} baseball players at their academy. He boasted that they would <b>wipe</b> <b>up</b> the diamond with your school--I am now quoting his words." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{asked you}} {{what you have to}} say against Walter Russell," [...] demanded Caleb. [...] "Come, out with it, or by the jumping beeswax, I'll <b>wipe</b> <b>up</b> this deck with you!" [...] And he doubled up his fists.|$|E
6000|$|... "Great Cæsar's ghost, and {{the floor}} not scrubbed!" [...] With a squawk of anxiety he leaped on the scrubbing-brush, and when Milt and Dlorus {{appeared}} at the door, Mr. Kloh and Miss Claire Boltwood were <b>wiping</b> <b>up</b> the kitchen floor.|$|R
60|$|Attached {{to the bar}} is a {{pneumatic}} beer-pump, {{by means}} of which the bar-tender can flood the bar with beer. Afterwards he <b>wipes</b> <b>up</b> the beer with a rag. By this means he polishes the bar. Some of the beer that is pumped up spills into glasses {{and has to be}} sold.|$|R
60|$|After {{securing}} the Caelops frithii, removing the shattered glass, <b>wiping</b> <b>up</b> the oil, and putting chairs and tables on their legs, the professor was urged {{to go to}} bed,--advice which, in his excitement, he refused to take until it was suggested that, if he did not, he would be totally unfit for exploring the forest next day.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind; {{you just}} <b>wipe</b> <b>up</b> {{your face and}} come along, and we'll tell Ma all about it, and she'll fix us as nice as can be. I shouldn't wonder if Sanch got home now before we did," [...] said Ben, cheering himself {{as well as her}} by the fond hope.|$|E
6000|$|It was Andrew Jackson Sutter who, despising Mr. Cutter for remarks [...] {{he heard}} him utter in debate upon the floor, [...] Swung him {{up into the}} skylight, in the peaceful, pensive twilight, [...] and then keerlessly proceeded, makin' no account what WE did-- [...] To <b>wipe</b> <b>up</b> with his person casual dust upon the floor.|$|E
6000|$|... "'You didn't get any brag from me,' poor Bobby said, {{his voice}} {{trembling}} {{as if he}} wanted to cry. 'I'm going to do just as I allowed, and you two fellows want to follow me close, so's to make certain I <b>wipe</b> <b>up</b> the earth with Mr. Towser, if he has the nerve to show himself where I am.' ...|$|E
25|$|Among {{the many}} {{elements}} taken from The Dolorous Passion are scenes {{such as the}} suspension of Jesus from a bridge after his arrest by the Temple guards, the torment of Judas by demons after he had handed over Jesus to the Sanhedrin, the <b>wiping</b> <b>up</b> of the blood of Jesus after his scourging, and the dislocation of Jesus' shoulder so that his palm would reach the hole bored for the nail.|$|R
50|$|Nadine {{anchored}} Al Arabiya's {{special coverage}} of the major Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC) markets' correction that <b>wiped</b> <b>up</b> to 50 {{percent of the market}} capitalization of GCC stocks at the beginning of 2006. Her experience however goes beyond the newsroom to the field, where she has reported live from the NYSE, and has done investigative reports from major Arab cities especially Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to keep laminate clean, as dust, dirt, and sand particles may scratch the surface over time in high-traffic areas. It is also important to keep laminate relatively dry, since sitting water/moisture can cause the planks to swell, warp, etc., though some brands are equipped with water-resistant coatings. Water spills aren't a problem if they're <b>wiped</b> <b>up</b> quickly, and not allowed to sit for a prolonged period of time.|$|R
60|$|Among other peculiarities in Mr Sudberry's character, he was {{afflicted with}} a chronic {{tendency}} to dab his pen into the ink-bottle and split {{it to the}} feather, or double up its point so as to render it unserviceable. This infirmity, coupled with an uncommon capacity for upsetting ink-bottles, had induced him to hire a small clerk, whose principal duties were to mend pens, <b>wipe</b> <b>up</b> ink, and, generally, {{to attend to the}} removal of debris.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind. They let the {{sunshine}} through just as well," [...] said Faith cheerfully. [...] "They MUST be clean {{after all the}} soap and water I've used, and that's the main thing. Now, it's past eleven, so I'll <b>wipe</b> <b>up</b> this mess {{on the floor and}} we'll go outside. You dust the furniture and I'll shake the rugs. I'm going {{to do it in the}} graveyard. I don't want to send dust flying all over the lawn.|$|E
6000|$|... "Whoop her up, Dauntless!" [...] yelled Roy Bock, {{as soon as}} {{he reached}} the {{grandstand}}. [...] "Whoop her up, and <b>wipe</b> <b>up</b> the ground with Putnam Hall!" [...] And then he swung his big rattle, and his cronies did likewise. Then the Pornellites crowded into the grandstand and took seats near Pepper and his fellow cadets and the girls. They talked in loud voices and said {{a number of things that}} caused the faces of the girls to burn, and made the cadets thoroughly angry.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the many}} {{elements}} {{taken from the}} Dolorous Passion are scenes such as the suspension of Jesus from a bridge after his arrest by the Temple guards, the torment of Judas by demons after he had handed over Jesus to the Sanhedrin, the <b>wiping</b> <b>up</b> of the blood of Jesus after his scourging, and the dislocation of Jesus' shoulder so that his palm would reach the hole bored for the nail.|$|R
5000|$|Wet wipes {{can serve}} {{a number of}} {{personal}} and household purposes. [...] Although marketed primarily for wiping infants' bottoms in diaper changing, {{it is not uncommon}} for consumers to also use the product to clean floors, toilet seats, and other surfaces around the home. Parents also use wet wipes, or as they are called for baby care, baby <b>wipes,</b> for <b>wiping</b> <b>up</b> baby vomit and to clean babies' hands and faces.|$|R
60|$|The starch {{having been}} <b>wiped</b> <b>up</b> by Molly's help, and the ironing {{apparatus}} put by, Mrs. Poyser took up her knitting which always lay ready at hand, {{and was the}} work she liked best, because she could carry it on automatically as she walked to and fro. But now she came and sat down opposite Dinah, whom she looked at in a meditative way, as she knitted her grey worsted stocking.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "you'll do no good wi' crying an' making more wet to <b>wipe</b> <b>up.</b> It's all your own wilfulness, as I tell you, for there's nobody no call to break {{anything}} if they'll only go {{the right way}} to work. But wooden folks had need ha' wooden things t' handle. And here must I take the brown-and-white jug, as it's niver been used three times this year, and go down i' the cellar myself, and belike catch my death, and be laid up wi' inflammation...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I won't go to {{any more}} of their cursed nonsense, Tom," [...] said St. Clare; [...] "on my honor, I won't. I don't know why I haven't stopped long ago. I've always despised it, and myself for it,--so now, Tom, <b>wipe</b> <b>up</b> your eyes, and go about your errands. Come, come," [...] he added, [...] "no blessings. I'm not so wonderfully good, now," [...] he said, as he gently pushed Tom to the door. [...] "There, I'll pledge my honor to you, Tom, you don't see me so again," [...] he said; and Tom went off, wiping his eyes, with great satisfaction.|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep your {{stitches}} whole, Cousin; if any skins {{are to be}} pricked it can't be helped, and {{at least}} you won't have to <b>wipe</b> <b>up</b> the mess. I {{am not going to}} run away from the man, more likely he will run away from me. I look well in this fine dress of yours, and I mean to wear it out. Now begone--begone, before some of them come to seek me. Don't you grieve for me; I'll lie in the bed that I have made, and if the worst comes to the worst, I have money in my pocket--or its worth--and we will meet again in England. Come, give my love and duty to Master Peter and your father, and if I should see them no more, bid them think kindly of Betty Dene, who was such a plague to them." ...|$|E
50|$|Squircles {{have also}} been used to {{construct}} dinner plates. A squircular plate has a larger area (and can thus hold more food) than a circular one with the same radius, but still occupies {{the same amount of}} space in a rectangular or square cupboard. This is even more true of a square plate, but there are various problems (such as fragility, and difficulty of <b>wiping</b> <b>up</b> sauce) associated with the corners of square plates.|$|R
6000|$|... "My brother Seth," [...] replied Mrs. Grant, still laughing. [...] "I {{thought you}} might be afraid to be there all alone, so he slipped into the bedroom, and I forgot to tell you. He's a {{powerful}} snorer, and that's one of the awful sounds. The other was the dripping of salt water; for you wanted some, and the girl got it in a leaky pail. Seth <b>wiped</b> <b>up</b> the slops when he came out early in the morning." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{went to my}} mother. Presently {{she raised}} herself {{from the ground and}} sat up with her hands over her face. The blood from the wound the stick had made ran down her face on to her breast, and I wiped it away with grass. She sat for a long while thus, while the child cried, the cow lowed to be milked, and I <b>wiped</b> <b>up</b> the blood with the grass. At last she took her hands away and spoke to me.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Roberts, {{with many}} proofs of an afternoon's {{shopping}} {{in her hands}} and arms, appears {{at the door of the}} ladies' room, opening from the public hall, and studies the interior with a searching gaze, which develops a few suburban shoppers scattered over the settees, with their bags and packages, and two or three old ladies in the rocking-chairs. The Chorewoman is going about with a Saturday afternoon pail and mop, and profiting by the disoccupation of the place in the hour between the departures of two great expresses, to <b>wipe</b> <b>up</b> the floor. She passes near the door where Mrs. Roberts is standing, and Mrs. Roberts appeals to her in the anxiety which her failure to detect the object of her search has awakened: [...] "Oh, I was just looking for my husband. He was to meet me here at ten minutes past three; but there don't seem to be any gentlemen." ...|$|E
6000|$|As for Peter, he {{has already}} been {{described}} as the timid clerk of humble origin, whose chief duties, while in London, were to <b>wipe</b> <b>up</b> ink and clear away debris. He had been taken with the family to act the part of a page in buttons without the buttons--and to make himself generally useful. Hitherto the page's bosom had, since leaving London, been a chamber of indescribable terrors. Truly, if, as is said, the anticipation of death be worse than the reality, poor Peter must have suffered a prolonged and continuous death during the last few days. Never having been on a railway before, the first shriek of the whistle pierced him like a knife, the shock of starting rent him, (figuratively), like a thunderbolt. Thereafter, every passing train was an excruciating arrow in his quivering heart, every tunnel was a plunge into the horrible anticipation that [...] "here it was coming at last!" [...] But Peter's trials were now, for a time, he fondly hoped, at an end. Poor boy! he little knew what was in store for him.|$|E
60|$|Every {{expended}} butt {{in the old}} cellar did he set a-tilt, {{and shake}} with the desperate expectation of collecting enough of the grounds of claret to fill the large pewter measure which he carred in his hand. Alas! each had been too devoutly drained; and, with all the squeezing and manoeuvring which his craft as a butler suggested, he could only collect about half a quart that seemed presentable. Still, however, Caleb was too good a general to renounce the field without a strategem to cover his retreat. He undauntedly threw down an empty flagon, {{as if he had}} stumbled at the entrance of the apartment, called upon Mysie to <b>wipe</b> <b>up</b> the wine that had never been spilt, and placing the other vessel on the table, hoped there was still enough left for their honours. There was indeed; for even Bucklaw, a sworn friend to the grape, found no encouragement to renew his first attack upon the vintage of Wolf's Crag, but contented himself, however reluctantly, with a draught of fair water. Arrangements were now made for his repose; and as the secret chamber was assigned for this purpose, it furnished Caleb with a first-rate and most plausible apology for all deficiencies of furniture, bedding, etc.|$|E
60|$|Their eyes {{followed}} {{the movements of}} the little girl as she spread the breakfast-cloth on the table they had been using, without <b>wiping</b> <b>up</b> the slops of the liquor. The curtains were undrawn, and the expression of the house made to look like morning. Some of the guests, however, fell asleep in their chairs. One or two went to the door, and gazed along the street more than once. Tinker Taylor was the chief of these, and after a time he came in with a leer on his face.|$|R
2500|$|The {{series of}} attacks started on 23 September 1995, at about 6:00p.m. CET, when Borel killed his stepfather, Yves Bichet, {{in the kitchen}} by {{shooting}} him four times with a [...]22-caliber rifle, before smashing {{his head with a}} hammer. Police assumed that they had a quarrel beforehand, when Borel tried to run away from home. Next, Borel assaulted his half-brother, 11-year-old Jean-Yves Bichet, who was watching TV, in a similar manner, by first shooting him with the rifle and afterwards bludgeoning his head with the hammer. After <b>wiping</b> <b>up</b> the blood trails, Borel waited for his mother to come home.|$|R
2500|$|New Zealand's second innings started smoothly, with Blair Hartland and Bryan Young adding 59 before Hartland became DeFreitas's {{hundredth}} Test victim. [...] Young {{went on to}} make 53, {{but that}} ended up being the tourists highest score. [...] Such bowled extremely economically {{in the middle of}} the innings, his 34 overs conceding just 50 runs, and he picked up the wickets of Rutherford and Shane Thomson, and although Parore once again dug in to try to restore some pride, when DeFreitas (5-71) returned he <b>wiped</b> <b>up</b> the tail, finally removing Parore (42) caught behind as the last wicket.|$|R
