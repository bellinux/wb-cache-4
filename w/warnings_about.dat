5|$|Fearing a major {{hurricane}} strike, coastal locations from Florida to Virginia performed extensive preparations {{in advance}} of the storm. In addition to tropical cyclone watches and <b>warnings,</b> <b>about</b> 950,000people were evacuated from the Carolinas, and the military evacuated and relocated hundreds of aircraft and vessels from the storm's projected path. Soldiers and guardsmen were deployed throughout those regions.|$|E
5|$|In comparison, 2008 Presidential {{candidate}} Hillary Clinton {{began to}} disengage from Hsu {{at an earlier}} phase of the scandal when Hsu's long time fugitive status was first revealed. After indications of additional misconduct by Hsu, the Clinton campaign then decided to refund a total of $850,000 in bundled contributions Clinton {{was the first major}} candidate to give up bundled contributions from associates of Norman Hsu. However, {{it is also true that}} her campaign ignored earlier private <b>warnings</b> <b>about</b> Hsu and that Clinton was the largest recipient of bundled donations from Hsu.|$|E

5|$|Lea {{took him}} {{to one side and}} {{informed}} him of the charges, but Corder denied all knowledge of both Maria and the crime. A search of the house uncovered a pair of pistols supposedly bought {{on the day of the}} murder, some letters from a Mr Gardener, which may have contained <b>warnings</b> <b>about</b> the discovery of the crime, and a passport from the French ambassador, evidence which suggested that Corder may have been preparing to flee.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Roy's {{increasingly}} erratic behavior causes Ronnie {{to become}} upset and leave him, taking {{their three children}} with her, never to be seen again. When a despairing Roy inadvertently sees a television news program about the train wreck near Devils Tower, he realizes the mental image of a mountain plaguing him is real. Jillian sees the same broadcast, and she and Roy, {{as well as others}} with similar visions and experiences, travel to the site in spite of the public <b>warnings</b> <b>about</b> nerve gas.|$|E
5|$|One mine-awareness {{campaign}} involving {{billboard advertising}} attracted {{criticism from the}} Ministry of Tourism and the Croatian National Tourist Board (CNTB) because the signs were placed in tourist areas, far from any mine-suspected areas. The Ministry of Tourism and the CNTB welcomed the effort's humanitarian aspect, but considered the signs a potential source of unwarranted negative reaction from tourists. Tourist guidebooks of Croatia include <b>warnings</b> <b>about</b> the danger posed by mines in the country, and provide general information about their location.|$|E

5|$|The IRA {{had sent}} telephoned <b>warnings</b> <b>about</b> 90 {{minutes before the}} bomb detonated. At least 75,000 people were {{evacuated}} from the area, but the bomb squad were unable to defuse the bomb in time. More than 200 people were injured {{but there were no}} fatalities despite the strength of the bomb, which has been largely credited to the fast response of emergency services. At the time, England was hosting the Euro '96 football championships and a Russia vs Germany match was to take place in Manchester the following day.|$|E
5|$|Toxic {{blue-green algae}} blooms are a {{reasonably}} common occurrence in the lake. <b>Warnings</b> <b>about</b> coming {{into contact with}} the water are released when an algal bloom is detected. Attempts are being made to limit the amount of phosphates entering the lake in the hope of improving its water quality. Blue-green algae (more correctly cyanobacteria) produce toxins, which can be harmful for humans and any other animals that come in contact with the contaminated water. There have been several cases of dogs being affected after playing in and drinking the lake water.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane {{warnings}} {{were put}} in effect for six provinces in southeastern Cuba, where significant precipitation ranging up to 20inches (500mm) across the mountainous south was expected {{as the center of}} Ernesto tracked slowly across Cuba. Cuban officials evacuated 300,000people and brought its fishing fleet into harbors. The Cuban state television broadcast extensive <b>warnings</b> <b>about</b> the storm, urging precautions. Cattle were moved to higher ground, tourists were evacuated from hotels in the southeastern province of Granma, and baseball games scheduled for the evening of August 27 in Havana were played earlier in the day. The threat of the storm caused domestic flights to be canceled.|$|E

5|$|The next morning, Jo {{is furious}} to {{discover}} that all the chickens have been slaughtered. Blaming a local fox, she lays traps for the animal and goes after it with a rifle, assisted by Jessica and Kator. When the hunt fails, Kator tracks and kills the fox {{on his own and}} presents it to Jessica and Jo as a trophy. The trio celebrate with a champagne party for which Jo dresses Kator in drag. A subsequent game of hide-and-seek brings out more of the hunter in Kator. Later, Jo is disturbed to find the fox carcass stripped bare and realises that the animal was not caught in a trap as she and Jessica thought. Jessica angrily rejects her <b>warnings</b> <b>about</b> Anders, interpreting Jo's fear as jealousy and revealing that she knows the truth about Simon.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 28 January, the Coalition {{received}} {{a number of}} warnings suggesting an impending Iraqi offensive. The Coalition was flying two brand-new E-8A Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS) aircraft, which picked up the deployment and movement of Iraqi forces to the area opposite of Khafji. Observation posts 2, 7 and 8 also detected heavy Iraqi reconnoitering along the border, and their small teams of air-naval gunfire liaison Marines called in air and artillery strikes throughout the day. Lieutenant Colonel Richard Barry, commander of the forward headquarters of the 1st Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Intelligence Group, sent <b>warnings</b> <b>about</b> an impending attack to Central Command. CentCom leaders were too preoccupied with the air campaign to heed them however, and so the Iraqi operation came as a surprise.|$|E
5|$|When the {{restoration}} of the Sistine Chapel was announced, it sparked a barrage of queries and objections from art historians around the world. One of the most vocal of these critics was James Beck, of ArtWatch International, who issued repeated <b>warnings</b> <b>about</b> the possibility of damage to Michelangelo's work from over-strenuous restoration. An argument that was used repeatedly was that all the previous interventions had caused damage of one sort or another. Any restoration, as opposed to conservation, puts an artwork at risk. Conservation, on the other hand, aids in the preservation of the work in its present state and in prevention of further deterioration. Beck has written about his concerns in Art Restoration, the Culture, the Business and the Scandal.|$|E

5|$|Kouao and Climbié {{left the}} Ivory Coast {{possibly}} in November 1998 and flew to Paris, France, where Climbié enrolled at school. By December 1998, however, Kouao began to receive <b>warnings</b> <b>about</b> Climbié's absenteeism, and in February 1999, the school issued a child-at-risk notification {{and a social}} worker became involved. The school observed how Climbié tended to fall asleep in class, and the headteacher later recalled Kouao's mentioning Climbié suffering from some form of dermatological condition and that, on her last visit to the school on 25 March 1999, Climbié had a shaven head and was wearing a wig. When they left France, Kouao owed the authorities £2,000, after being wrongly paid in child benefit, and it is claimed that Kouao viewed Climbié as {{a useful tool for}} claiming benefits. Kouao had also been evicted from her home in France because of rent arrears.|$|E
5|$|Noriega {{received}} several <b>warnings</b> <b>about</b> the invasion from individuals within his government; though he initially disbelieved them, they grew more frequent as the invasion drew near, eventually convincing Noriega {{to go on}} the run. Noriega used a number of subterfuges, including lookalikes and playbacks of his recorded voice, to confuse U.S. surveillance as to his whereabouts. During his flight Noriega reportedly took shelter with several supportive politicians, including Balbita Periñan, the mayor of San Miguelito. The last two days of his flight were spent partly with Noriega's ally Jorge Krupnick. Kempe reported that Noriega considered seeking sanctuary in the Cuban or Nicaraguan embassies, but both buildings were surrounded by U.S. troops. On the fifth day of the invasion, Noriega and four others took sanctuary in the Apostolic Nunciature, the Holy See's embassy in Panama. Having threatened to flee to the countryside and lead guerrilla warfare if not given refuge, he instead turned over the majority of his weapons, and requested sanctuary from José Sebastián Laboa, the papal representative.|$|E
5|$|The Nazis used several public {{relations}} tactics {{to convince the}} general population of Germany not to smoke. Well-known health magazines like the Gesundes Volk (Healthy People), Volksgesundheit (People's Health) and Gesundes Leben (Healthy Life) published <b>warnings</b> <b>about</b> the health consequences of smoking and posters showing the harmful effects of tobacco were displayed. Anti-smoking messages were sent to the people in their workplaces, often {{with the help of the}} Hitler-Jugend (HJ) and the Bund Deutscher Mädel (BDM). The anti-smoking campaign undertaken by the Nazis also included health education. In June 1939, a Bureau against the Hazards of Alcohol and Tobacco was formed and the Reichsstelle für Rauschgiftbekämpfung (Reich Office for Drug Control) also helped in the anti-tobacco campaign. Articles advocating nonsmoking were published in the magazines Die Genussgifte (The Recreational Stimulants), Auf der Wacht (On the Guard) and Reine Luft (Clean Air). Out of these magazines, Reine Luft was the main journal of the anti-tobacco movement. Karl Astel's Institute for Tobacco Hazards Research at Jena University purchased and distributed hundreds of reprints from Reine Luft.|$|E
