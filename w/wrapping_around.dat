5|$|Venus {{is known}} {{not to have}} a {{magnetic}} field. The reason for its absence is not clear, but is probably related to the planet's slow rotation or the lack of convection in the mantle. Venus only has an induced magnetosphere formed by the Sun's magnetic field carried by the solar wind. This process can be understood as the field lines <b>wrapping</b> <b>around</b> an obstacle—Venus in this case. The induced magnetosphere of Venus has a bow shock, magnetosheath, magnetopause and magnetotail with the current sheet.|$|E
5|$|Supersymmetry {{severely}} {{restricts the}} possible number of dimensions of a brane. In 1987, Eric Bergshoeff, Ergin Sezgin, and Paul Townsend showed that eleven-dimensional supergravity includes two-dimensional branes. Intuitively, these objects look like sheets or membranes propagating through the eleven-dimensional spacetime. Shortly after this discovery, Michael Duff, Paul Howe, Takeo Inami, and Kellogg Stelle considered a particular compactification of eleven-dimensional supergravity {{with one of}} the dimensions curled up into a circle. In this setting, one can imagine the membrane <b>wrapping</b> <b>around</b> the circular dimension. If the radius of the circle is sufficiently small, then this membrane looks just like a string in ten-dimensional spacetime. In fact, Duff and his collaborators showed that this construction reproduces exactly the strings appearing in type IIA superstring theory.|$|E
5|$|The African {{elephant}} has two finger-like extensions {{at the tip}} of {{the trunk}} that allow it to grasp and bring food to its mouth. The Asian elephant has only one, and relies more on <b>wrapping</b> <b>around</b> a food item and squeezing it into its mouth. Asian elephants have more muscle coordination and can perform more complex tasks. Losing the trunk would be detrimental to an elephant's survival, although in rare cases, individuals have survived with shortened ones. One elephant has been observed to graze by kneeling on its front legs, raising on its hind legs and taking in grass with its lips. Floppy trunk syndrome is a condition of trunk paralysis in African bush elephants caused by the degradation of the peripheral nerves and muscles beginning at the tip.|$|E

5|$|The stadium was {{designed}} to be capable of supporting future seating expansion to 80,000. The 30,000 seats would be added above the second deck of the stadium {{from the end of the}} press boxes across to the northwest end of the venue, <b>wrapping</b> <b>around</b> the remainder of the horseshoe. The auxiliary video display currently adjacent to the easternmost section of the media areas would likely be relocated to atop the new third deck. The University of Minnesota could add all 30,000 seats in a single addition or in increments of 10,000 seats, meeting demand as it is needed (although the duplicated costs of such a plan make it unlikely). If expansion is ever undertaken, it can be completed in about 9 months so that there would be minimal interruption of a football season.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the day on}} July2, the {{depression}} began to take a slow northward track {{in response to a}} mid-level subtropical ridge to the east and later that day, the JTWC upgraded it to a tropical storm. Early the next day, the JMA also upgraded the system to a tropical storm, at which time it received the name Kirogi. Although a broad cyclone, convection was gradually <b>wrapping</b> <b>around</b> the southern periphery of the circulation. Several hours after being named, the JMA upgraded Kirogi to a severe tropical storm and later a typhoon. At the same time, the JTWC classified the storm as a typhoon. Upon being upgraded the typhoon featured a well-developed outflow and prominent banding features consolidating around the system.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Cyclone Urmil (RSMC Nadi designation: 06F, JTWC designation: 07P) {{was a short}} lived {{storm of}} January 2006 that explosively {{intensified}} to reach its peak intensity as a high-end Category 2 cyclone on the Australian Scale, just 12hours after being named. Forming out of a tropical disturbance early on January14, Urmil quickly intensified before weakening just as quickly. The intensification {{was a result of}} the main convective banding feature <b>wrapping</b> <b>around</b> the center of circulation. However, the combination of high wind shear and the rapid movement of the cyclone caused convection to become separated from the center. By January15, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone shortly before dissipating. Urmil had only minor effects on land; scattered vegetation damage was reported in Tonga.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Ivan {{gradually}} became better organized as wind shear decreased, and its outflow expanded in all quadrants. Satellite imagery late on September 3 depicted a well-defined curved band <b>wrapping</b> <b>around</b> {{much of the}} circulation. The next day, the deep convection temporarily became ill-defined, before reorganizing and developing an eye feature. Convection strengthened further as the feature transitioned into an eye, and Ivan became a hurricane at around 0600UTC on September 5. After reaching hurricane status, Ivan began to rapidly intensify with continued favorable conditions, and in an 18‑hour period the pressure dropped 39mbar (1.15inHg) as the winds increased by 60mph (95km/h); early on September 6 Ivan attained an initial peak intensity of 135mph (215km/h) while located about 825miles (1330km) east of the island of Tobago in the southern Lesser Antilles.|$|E
5|$|On 14 April 1471, {{at around}} 4o'clock in the morning, both armies woke. Edward had planned {{for an early}} attack, however, and quickly roused his men to engage the Lancastrians. Both sides fired their cannon and arrows before laying into each other with polearms. The morning fog was thick and the night {{movements}} of the two forces had displaced them laterally with each other. Neither group was facing the other; each was offset slightly to the right. This displacement meant that the right end of either army could outflank the other by <b>wrapping</b> <b>around</b> the opposing left end. The Lancastrians {{were the first to}} exploit this advantage; Oxford's group quickly overwhelmed Hastings'. Yorkist soldiers fled towards Barnet, chased by the Lancastrians. Some of Hastings' men even reached London, spreading tales of the fall of York and a Lancastrian victory. Oxford's group disintegrated as they split off to loot the fallen enemies and plunder Barnet. Yelling and chasing after his men, Oxford rallied 800 of them and led them back to the battle.|$|E
5|$|Six {{hours after}} being {{declared}} a depression, the system quickly intensified into a tropical storm, {{at which time}} it was given the name Rick. Deep convection, an early indication of an eye forming, had begun <b>wrapping</b> <b>around</b> {{the center of the}} system. Early on October16, a ragged eyewall began to develop and several hours later, Rick intensified into a Category1 hurricane with winds of 75mph (120km/h). The rapid intensification was fueled by waters of , several degrees above average. By the evening of October16, microwave satellite imagery depicted a well-defined eye; however, this feature was not present on infrared images. Despite this, the NHC upgraded Rick to a Category2 hurricane with winds now reaching 100mph (155km/h). Early the next morning, the storm intensified into a major hurricane, a storm that ranks as a Category3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. The eye was clearly visible on satellite images and deep, very cold convection surrounded it, signifying a powerful cyclone. Less than 40 minutes after this upgrade, the NHC issued a special advisory stating that Rick had further strengthened into a Category4 hurricane.|$|E

5|$|The {{precursor}} to Hurricane Celia was first identified on June5, 2010 by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) as a disorganized area of disturbed weather {{associated with a}} tropical wave off the western coast of Africa in the Atlantic Ocean. Tracking westward, little development took place and the system eventually crossed Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean on June17. Situated several hundred miles south-southeast of the Gulf of Tehuantepec, the disturbance moved slowly towards the west-northwest and little development was expected to occur. By June18, scatterometer data of the system indicated that a surface circulation had developed and the system's overall structure had become increasingly organized. Later that day, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued for the system as it was now anticipated to become a tropical cyclone within 48hours. At this time, convective banding features had begun <b>wrapping</b> <b>around</b> the system; however, it lacked deep, central cloud cover. Further development {{was expected to be}} slow due to moderate wind shear in the region of the low. Around 1800UTC, the system had become sufficiently organized for the NHC to designate it as a tropical depression. At this time, the depression was situated roughly 370mi (595km) southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Operationally, the depression was not warned upon until early the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Florence {{turned to}} the north and {{north-northeast}} through a break in the subtropical ridge. Though its eyewall was open on the north side, favorable conditions led forecasters to predict Florence passing near Bermuda as a strong Category 2 hurricane. The inner core of convection became ragged-looking on satellite imagery, and based on reports from Hurricane Hunters it is estimated the hurricane attained peak winds of 90mph (150km/h) late on September 10. Subsequent to further erosion of the eyewall, the hurricane weakened, and on September 11 passed about 60miles (95km) west of Bermuda with winds of 85mph (135km/h). The overall cloud pattern became slightly better organized, and Florence briefly re-strengthened before encountering increased upper-level winds and cooler waters. Dry air <b>wrapping</b> <b>around</b> the southern periphery of the cyclone eroded most of the deep convection by early on September 12. The cloud shield became asymmetrically displaced {{to the north of the}} center, and frontal-like features began to form. It continued to lose tropical characteristics, and on September 13 Florence transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about 485miles (780km) south-southwest of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Initially maintaining hurricane-force winds, the extratropical remnant passed near Cape Race before turning to the east-northeast, and on September 14 the winds weakened to gale force. The storm executed a broad cyclonic half-loop to the southwest of Iceland over the subsequent days, and after turning to the west the extratropical remnants of Florence were absorbed to the east of Greenland by a developing extratropical cyclone to its south.|$|E
