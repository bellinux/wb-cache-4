5|$|Television {{audiences for}} the final reached more than 10million in both Spain and the United Kingdom. 11.3million people watched the match on Spain's Antena 3 network – the largest viewing figures for that station {{in the past year}} – while another 600,000 <b>watched</b> <b>on</b> Canal+ Spain. In the United Kingdom, however, {{although}} the match received the highest ratings of any programme that evening, viewing figures were down by 1.5million on the previous year's final, with just 9.6million watching on ITV1, although an additional 1.79million <b>watched</b> <b>on</b> Sky Sports 1. Despite there being no Italian or French representative in the final, the figures were much the same in those two countries as they were in Spain and the United Kingdom, with Italy's Rai Uno garnering an average viewership of 9.63million and France's TF1 receiving 8.25million. Only 6.55million people watched the match on Germany's Sat.1 channel. According to a survey, global viewing figures for the match averaged 109million; this put the UEFA Champions League final above the Super Bowl (106million viewers in 2009) as the most-watched annual sporting event in the world. Total figures, which included viewers who watched only part of the match, put the Champions League final even further ahead of the Super Bowl, with 206million viewers compared to 162million.|$|E

5|$|Mulder and Scully {{visit the}} murderer's house, where Mulder sees a {{repairman}} {{working on the}} cable line. They find hundreds of video tapes of the news. Scully believes all the violence the man <b>watched</b> <b>on</b> TV may have {{led him to the}} murders, something Mulder does not believe. That night Scully watches the tapes, seeing if there are any clues to why the man committed murder. She steps outside for a break and sees Mulder in a car talking to the Cigarette Smoking Man. In the morning Scully suspiciously asks Mulder if he moved the car in the night. When Mulder tells her he only went out for a paper earlier, she believes he is lying. The next day a similar murder occurs when a woman thinks she sees her husband in a hammock with another woman; in reality she has killed her neighbor who was in a hammock with his dog. Mulder sees the same cable repairman near the house, who escapes from him. Climbing up on the telephone pole Mulder finds a device inside the cable box.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{reliability}} of these metrics has been drawn into question, partly due to widely divergent estimates. For example, between May and June 2010, ComScore updated its scoring methodology and its estimates for Hulu dropped from 43.5 million unique viewers to 24 million in a single month.

As the Romanian authorities established a provisional capital in Iași, the indignant Carp personally witnessed the triumphal entry of German troops into Bucharest.|$|E
25|$|The electoral {{start of}} 1888 brought an {{explosive}} situation. All opposition forces, including Fleva's group, reached {{most of their}} electoral goals, even though the government remained in place. On March 14, when Carol returned from a visit to Berlin, Fleva, with Catargiu, Blaremberg and various others, instigated a riot which began at Orfeu Hall, Bucharest. Under their supervision, the crowd trying to occupy the building and make it an anti-government fief found its access blocked by pro-government men (soldiers, mounted Gendarmes, police or simply National Liberal militants). A chase followed through the city center, and the rioters attempted {{to make their way}} into the (old) Royal Palace, to demand that the king dispose of Brătianu.

She is in the company of Tommy Angel, an ex-SAS bodyguard who makes wildly optimistic passes at Rosie, such as suggesting that many people find this sort of danger arousing. Tommy then asks Rosie to hit him on the head to show how tough he is. Rosie does so, and Tommy instantly falls unconscious, out of view. Seconds later, Edna calls at the door. Rosie plays the part of Joanna well, and hands over the case of money from a hidden compartment in a table as soon as she sees the drugs. Unfortunately, when Edna inspects the briefcase, it is full of cut newspaper instead of money. Even though Rosie knows nothing about it, Edna tries to punish Rosie by spraying acid in her eyes. After a struggle, Edna catches her and is about to do the deed when Tracy comes in and brutally incapacitates her.|$|E
