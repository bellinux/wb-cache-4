5|$|A shot rang out. It {{was likely}} a <b>warning</b> <b>shot</b> fired by a panicked, {{exhausted}} British soldier from the 43rd, according to Captain Laurie's report to his commander after the fight. Two other regulars then fired immediately after that, shots splashing in the river, {{and then the}} narrow group up front, possibly thinking the order to fire had been given, fired a ragged volley before Laurie could stop them.|$|E
5|$|Marxuach fired a <b>warning</b> <b>shot</b> from {{a cannon}} {{located at the}} Santa Rosa battery of El Morro fort, in what is {{considered}} to be the first shot of World War I fired by the regular armed forces of the United States against a ship flying the colors of the Central Powers, forcing the Odenwald to stop and to return to port where its supplies were confiscated.|$|E
5|$|Assuming this <b>warning</b> <b>shot</b> {{had been}} fired {{in the belief that}} his brig, which was not flying a flag, may be an enemy vessel, Barlow ordered the British naval ensign and the pennant of the Channel Fleet run up. Thus clearly {{identified}} as a neutral British warship, Barlow allowed Childers to drift closer inshore with the tide. The French battery responded by raising tricolour flags and red pennants, a move copied by the other batteries covering the Goulet. Having drifted much closer to two batteries Childers suddenly came under heavy fire, the batteries containing very large 48-pounder cannon.|$|E

50|$|On 11 January 2008, the US Navy {{reported}} that Whidbey Island had fired <b>warning</b> <b>shots</b> near a small Iranian {{boat in the}} Strait of Hormuz in December. The boat was reportedly approaching Whidbey Island rapidly but stopped after the <b>warning</b> <b>shots</b> were fired.|$|R
50|$|On December 9, 1987 an F-4EJ {{operated}} by the squadron flying from Naha fired <b>warning</b> <b>shots</b> on two occasions when a Tupolev Tu-16 of the Soviet Air Force entered Japanese air space over Okinawa. This {{was the first time}} an SDF fighter had fired <b>warning</b> <b>shots</b> at an intruding aircraft.|$|R
5|$|Enterprise is then {{ordered to}} Mars {{to destroy the}} array, but is turned away when a <b>warning</b> <b>shot</b> from the weapon damages the ship. Gannet Brooks, now in the brig, reveals to Ensign Mayweather she is a Starfleet Intelligence operative, and that Terra Prime {{probably}} has an operative aboard. Under the urging of Minister Samuels, the crew of Enterprise conceive a way to approach the deadly station undetected, using a shuttlepod hidden inside {{the tail of a}} comet. Captain Archer elects to lead the away mission, along with Lieutenant Reed, Doctor Phlox, and Mayweather.|$|E
5|$|Koufax and Drysdale did {{not report}} to spring {{training}} in February. Instead, they both signed {{to appear in the}} movie <b>Warning</b> <b>Shot,</b> starring David Janssen. Drysdale was to play a TV commentator and Koufax a detective. Meanwhile, the Dodgers waged a public relations battle against them. After four weeks, Koufax gave Drysdale the go-ahead to negotiate new deals for both of them. Koufax ended up getting $125,000 and Drysdale $110,000 ($ today). They rejoined the team in the last week of spring training.|$|E
5|$|On January 16, 2013, Dunderdale held a {{surprise}} cabinet shuffle that saw Minister Marshall shuffled out of Finance and appointed as Minister of Natural Resources. He {{was replaced by}} Jerome Kennedy, who had served as Natural Resources Minister since October 2011. With contract negotiations underway with public sector unions Minister Kennedy's appointment was called a <b>warning</b> <b>shot</b> to the union leaders by the opposition. Minister Kennedy is considered a tough negotiator, and was Minister of Finance in 2008 during the last round of contract negotiations.|$|E
50|$|Although Spain never {{acted on}} its threat {{to destroy the}} English settlement, a Spanish vessel did arrive off of Castle Harbour, not long after settlement. Fortunately, the vessel turned and fled after the firing of <b>warning</b> <b>shots</b> by the Militia. According to popular accounts, the <b>warning</b> <b>shots</b> had left only enough powder for one more shot.|$|R
5000|$|On September 25 {{a five-minute}} {{skirmish}} broke out between Pakistani and US {{forces on the}} Afghan-Pakistan border after Pakistani soldiers fired <b>warning</b> <b>shots</b> near two US helicopters, according to a senior US military official. No one {{was reported to be}} injured. The US claims it never crossed the border and Nato said the helicopters came under fire from a Pakistani checkpoint. However, according to an official statement by Pakistan, commanders said troops fired <b>warning</b> <b>shots</b> at the helicopters when they strayed over the Pakistan border. The statement said the US helicopters were [...] "well within Pakistani territory", and that prompted their forces to fire <b>warning</b> <b>shots.</b>|$|R
25|$|On 2 February 2000, the Rajah Humabon fired <b>warning</b> <b>shots</b> at two Chinese {{fishing boats}} near Scarborough Shoal. According to Navy chief Vice Admiral Luisito Fernandez, the Rajah Humabon {{was forced to}} fire <b>warning</b> <b>shots</b> to avert a {{collision}} with two Chinese fishing boats and only after the Chinese boats refused to respond to radio contact, loudspeaker, sirens, and flashing lights.|$|R
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Königsberg was ordered to attack British commerce around {{the entrance to the}} Red Sea. A lack of coal hampered Looff's efforts; the British prevented his collier Koenig from leaving Dar es Salaam and purchased all the coal in Portuguese East Africa to deny it to Königsberg. Looff then radioed the German steamer Zieten to warn her against using the Suez Canal, where she would have been confiscated. Königsberg chased after the German freighter Goldenfels, whose officers mistook the ship for a British cruiser and refused to stop. Königsberg was forced to fire a <b>warning</b> <b>shot</b> across the bow of Goldenfels to force the ship to stop so that Looff could warn her captain of the state of war.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, Israeli AH-64As {{frequently}} attacked Hezbollah outposts in Lebanon. On 13 April 1996, during Operation Grapes of Wrath, an Apache fired two Hellfire {{missiles at}} an ambulance in Lebanon, killing six civilians. During the al-Aqsa Intifada in the 2000s, AH-64s {{were used to}} kill senior Hamas figures, such as Ahmed Yassin, Abed al-Aziz Rantissi, and Adnan al-Ghoul. On 24 May 2001, a privately owned Lebanese-registered Cessna 152 flew 15 minutes down the coast over Israeli airspace, refused to identify and respond to contact and a <b>warning</b> <b>shot</b> before it was shot down by an IAF AH-64A. IAF Apaches played {{a prominent role in}} the 2006 Lebanon War, launching strikes into Lebanon targeting Hezbollah forces.|$|E
5|$|In early 1798, after 14 {{months in}} Paris, Surcouf took command of Clarisse, a 14-gun {{privateer}} brig armed with four 12-pounders, ten 8-pounders, and manned by a 120-strong complement. He departed from Paimboeuf, Nantes, in February 1798, {{this time with}} a proper lettre de marque. During the journey to Isle de France, Clarisse chased a British slave ship, which escaped after one of her shots cut off Clarisse 's foremast tops. Surcouf captured a British brig South of Cape of Good Hope, which surrendered at the <b>warning</b> <b>shot,</b> on which he sent a prize crew under Captain Dujardin, and arrived La Réunion on 5 December.|$|E

5|$|On 2 December, The Washington Post {{reported}} an incident involving Montanan. While {{headed down the}} Pacific coast of Mexico with a cargo of dried fruits and canned goods, Montanan was approached by a Japanese warship, which fired a <b>warning</b> <b>shot</b> for Montanan to stop. After doing so, a boarding party with Japanese officers in a launch headed to Montanan. When the American identity of Montanan was established {{to the satisfaction of}} the Japanese, they returned to their ship without boarding Montanan. The news report did not identify the type or the name of the Japanese warship, which had been searching for a German vessel thought to be operating in the area.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war in May, Blitz was {{stationed}} as a guard ship in the Elbe, primarily in Glückstadt, where a large number of French prisoners of war were being transferred back to France. In July, Blitz became a fishery protection ship; though the duty was generally uneventful, in one case she had to fire a <b>warning</b> <b>shot</b> toward a British fishing vessel to force the crew to recognize German sovereignty. In late July, Blitz steamed to the island of Sylt, where Kronprinz (Crown Prince) Frederick, his wife Kronprinzessin (Crown Princess) Victoria, and their two sons, Wilhelm and Heinrich came aboard for a fishing trip. From 7 October 1871 to June 1872, Blitz {{was stationed}} as a guard ship in Altona, and on 26 June she began another stint as a fishery protection ship. While Blitz was patrolling in the northern North Sea on 29 June, one of her masts broke, forcing her to put into Aberdeen, Scotland for repairs. The crew's unfamiliarity with tidal conditions in Aberdeen nearly caused the boat to run aground. On 5 July, Blitz was ready to depart for the Shetland Islands, and she arrived in Lerwick three days later. On 9 July, she began the journey back to Germany, arriving in Wihelmshaven on the 20th.|$|E
5|$|Further success {{followed}} in early 1777 with {{the capture of}} the 18-gun American privateer General Montgomery. News had reached England that this vessel was off the island of Madeira in March, having sailed from the Port of Philadelphia in February with a crew of 100 men. Levant was sent in pursuit, with her crew sighting the General Montgomery at midday on 8 March. Captain Murray ordered Levant to fly false colours, hoisting a Dutch flag to avoid alerting the privateer's crew. General Montgomery had also disguised herself by flying a British flag. For several hours the Americans allowed Levant to draw near, finally turning to flee when Murray fired a <b>warning</b> <b>shot.</b> A seven-hour chase ensued, extending into the night with the two ships often within musket shot but unable to bring their broadside cannons to bear. At around 1:00am the wind strengthened and Levant was able to overhaul her prey, forcing the out-gunned Americans to surrender. Nine of General Montgomerys crew enlisted aboard Levant, with the remainder being conveyed to Portsmouth where they remained imprisoned in poor conditions {{until the end of}} the war.|$|E

5|$|Pattillo Higgins {{was born}} to Roberto James and Sarah (Raye) Higgins on December 5, 1863, in Sabine Pass, Texas. His family moved to Beaumont when he was six years old. He {{attended}} school {{until he reached the}} fourth grade, after which he apprenticed as a gunsmith under his father’s direction. In his youth, he was a violent troublemaker, pulling pranks and harassing African Americans. When he was seventeen, he pulled a prank on a black Baptist church that got the attention of a sheriff deputy. The deputy fired a <b>warning</b> <b>shot</b> over Higgins' head, after which Higgins fired back and delivered what would later {{turn out to be a}} fatal hit. The wounded deputy managed to fire again, striking Higgins lower left arm. Higgins' arm would later become severely infected, requiring amputation from the elbow down. Higgins was put on trial for the murder of the deputy, but he would be found not guilty by a jury that perceived his act as self-defense. After his acquittal, he worked as a logger along the Texas-Louisiana border, apparently unhindered by his lack of an arm. It was in 1885 that he attended a Baptist revival meeting where he made the decision to become a Christian. Realizing that the lumber camps were not the ideal place to maintain a good morality, he decided to return to Beaumont, Texas to establish himself as a businessman.|$|E
5|$|As {{the threat}} of a German naval attack had been removed by the {{destruction}} of the East Asia Squadron, Australia was free for deployment elsewhere. Initially, the battlecruiser was to serve as flagship of the West Indies Squadron, with the task of pursuing and destroying any German vessels that evaded North Sea blockades. Australia was ordered to sail to Jamaica via the Panama Canal, but as it was closed to heavy shipping, she was forced to sail down the coast of South America and pass through the Strait of Magellan during 31 December 1914 and 1 January 1915—Australia is the only ship of the RAN to cross from the Pacific to the Atlantic by sailing under South America. During the crossing, one of the warship's propellers was damaged, and she had to limp to the Falkland Islands at half speed. Temporary repairs were made, and Australia departed on 5 January. A vessel well clear of the usual shipping routes was spotted on the afternoon of the next day, and the battlecruiser attempted to pursue, but was hampered by the damaged propeller. Unable to close the gap before sunset, a <b>warning</b> <b>shot</b> was fired from 'A' turret, which caused the ship—the former German passenger liner, now naval auxiliary Eleonora Woermann—to stop and be captured. As Australia could not spare enough personnel to secure and operate the merchant ship, and Eleonora Woermann was too slow {{to keep pace with the}} battlecruiser, the German crew were taken aboard and the ship was sunk.|$|E

50|$|The ships {{enforced}} {{the embargo}} against Iraq by controlling merchant shipping, including 28 586 controls and the boarding of over 1000 ships for further inspection. 14 <b>warning</b> <b>shots</b> were fired. Notably, on 20 September, the Iraqi ship Al Taawin Al Aradien was intercepted by the cruiser , the Spanish frigate Infanta Cristina and the fleet escort Du Chayla; {{she refused to}} comply until <b>warning</b> <b>shots</b> were fired, but refused to be boarded by anyone but the French. A group of Fusiliers Marins hence inspected the ship.|$|R

25|$|Another legend {{claims that}} {{following}} the Navigation Acts (a 1651 ordinance by Oliver Cromwell requiring all foreign fleets in the North Sea or the Channel to dip their flag in salute) the Wilhelmus was sung (or rather, shouted) by the sailors on the Dutch flagship Brederode {{in response to}} the first <b>warning</b> <b>shot</b> fired by an English fleet under Robert Blake, when their captain Maarten Tromp refused to lower his flag. At the end of the song, which coincided with the third (i.e. last) English <b>warning</b> <b>shot,</b> Tromp fired a full broadside thereby beginning the Battle of Goodwin Sands and the First Anglo-Dutch War.|$|E
25|$|In March, {{during a}} virtual witch-hunt against 'heretical' preachers by Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, Gregory Cromwell {{requested}} Henry Dowes {{to write a}} letter detailing the recantation of William Jerome, Vicar of Stepney. This was significant, as Stepney was Thomas Cromwell's church, where he and his family worshipped. Gardiner was firing a <b>warning</b> <b>shot</b> in his rival's direction.|$|E
