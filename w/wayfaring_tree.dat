5|$|The site of {{the fort}} and warren is now grassy slopes which attract {{a wide range of}} wild flowers and butterflies. The differing soil types provide {{suitable}} habitats for both acid- and lime-loving plants. Kidney vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), harebell (Campanula rotundifolia) and woolly thistle (Cirsium eriophorum) thrive on the dry stony soils. Heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile) and wood sage (Teucrium scorodonia) are found in more acidic areas. The higher areas support bell heather (Erica cinerea), western gorse (Ulex gallii) and common heather (Calluna vulgaris). Trees and shrubs include the <b>wayfaring</b> <b>tree</b> (Viburnum lantana), guelder rose (Viburnum opulus), whitebeam (Sorbus aria), privet (Ligustrum vulgare) and dogwood (Cornus sanguinea).|$|E

60|$|How {{beautiful}} was the world! How beautiful, but how still! I {{walked slowly}} through the barley towards a line of elder bushes, <b>wayfaring</b> <b>tree</b> and bramble that made the hedge of the field. I noted as I passed along a dead shrew mouse, as it seemed to me, among the halms; then a still toad. I was surprised that this did not leap aside from my footfalls, and I stooped and picked it up. Its body was limp like life, but it made no struggle, the brightness of its eye was veiled, it did not move in my hand.|$|E
40|$|Tropospheric ozone and {{particulate}} matter affect {{human health and}} cause vegetation stress, dysfunction and damages. In this study we investigate the effect of increasing urban vegetation i. e. tree species on atmospheric chemistry, a potential urban management strategy to counteract high levels of local pollutants such as ozone, OH and PM 10 caused by e. g. traffic. We use an extended version of an atmospheric chemistry box model including detailed gas-phase chemistry, mixing layer height variation and secondary organic aerosol calculations based on observations for Berlin, Germany. It is shown to accurately simulate the observed ozone volume mixing ratios during the intensive measurement period in July 2014 (BAERLIN 2014) if basic parameters such as nitrogen oxides, meteorological conditions, PM 10 concentrations as well as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are considered as 1  h resolved datasets. Based on this setup the effects of changing present day vegetation mixture by 24 different relevant tree species and of urban greening is tested to elucidate benefits and drawbacks {{in order to support}} future urban planning. While the present day vegetation causes boundary layer ozone to decline slightly at 35  °C, individual tree types alter the ozone production rate and concentration as well as the secondary organic aerosol mass in different ways. Our results suggest that trees intensively emitting isoprene such as black locust, European oak and poplar result in higher ozone and total PM 10 concentrations than at present, while tree species emitting primarily monoterpenes such as beech, magnolia and <b>wayfaring</b> <b>trees</b> yield less of both. This is in line with the similar behaviour of OH concentration and new particle formation rates. Thus, for future urban planning including urban greening, consideration of the beneficial and harmful aspects of tree species need to ensure that citizens benefit from and are not being negatively affected by climate adaptation strategies...|$|R
6000|$|Lady Grove, you know, {{is a very}} {{beautiful}} house indeed, a still and gracious place, whose age-long seclusion was only effectively broken with the toot of {{the coming of the}} motor-car. An old Catholic family had died out in it, century by century, and was now altogether dead. Portions of the fabric are thirteenth century, and its last architectural revision was Tudor; within, it is for the most part dark and chilly, save for two or three favoured rooms and its tall-windowed, oak-galleried hall. Its terrace is its noblest feature; a very wide, broad lawn it is, bordered by a low stone battlement, and there is a great cedar in one corner under whose level branches one looks out across the blue distances of the Weald, blue distances that are made extraordinarily Italian in quality by virtue of the dark masses of that single tree. It is a very high terrace; southward one looks down upon the tops of <b>wayfaring</b> <b>trees</b> and spruces, and westward on a steep slope of beechwood, through which the road comes. One turns back to the still old house, and sees a grey and lichenous facade with a very finely arched entrance. It was warmed by the afternoon light and touched with the colour of a few neglected roses and a pyracanthus. It seemed to me that the most modern owner conceivable in this serene fine place was some bearded scholarly man in a black cassock, gentle-voiced and white-handed, or some very soft-robed, grey gentlewoman. And there was my uncle holding his goggles in a sealskin glove, wiping the glass with a pocket-handkerchief, and asking my aunt if Lady Grove wasn't a [...] "Bit of all Right." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{had a great}} walk, not a long one, but a great one. They went up by the Sanatorium, {{and over}} the East Cliff and into that queer little {{wilderness}} of slippery and tumbling clay and rock under the chalk cliffs, a wilderness of thorn and bramble, wild rose and <b>wayfaring</b> <b>tree,</b> that adds so greatly to Folkestone's charm. They traversed its intricacies and clambered up to {{the crest of the}} cliffs at last by a precipitous path that Chitterlow endowed in some mysterious way with suggestions of Alpine adventure. Every now and then he would glance aside at sea and cliffs with a fresh boyishness of imagination that brought back New Romney and the stranded wrecks to Kipps' memory; but mostly he bored on with his great obsession of plays and playwriting, and that empty absurdity that is so serious to his kind, his Art. That was a thing that needed a monstrous lot of explaining. Along they went, sometimes abreast, sometimes in single file, up the little paths, and down the little paths, and in among the bushes and out along the edge above the beach, and Kipps went along trying ever and again to get an insignificant word in edgeways, and the gestures of Chitterlow flew wide and far and his great voice rose and fell, and he said this and he said that and he biffed and banged into the circumambient Inane.|$|E

5000|$|Viburnum lantanoides (commonly {{known as}} hobble-bush, [...] witch-hobble, alder-leaved viburnum, American <b>wayfaring</b> <b>tree,</b> and moosewood) is a {{perennial}} shrub {{of the family}} Adoxaceae (formerly in the Caprifoliaceae), growing 2-4 meters (6-12 ft) high with pendulous branches that take root where they touch the ground. These rooted branches form obstacles which easily trip (or hobble) walkers - hence the common name.|$|E
50|$|Mesolithic pointed shafts {{have been}} found in England, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden. They were often rather long, up to 120 cm (4 ft) and made of European hazel (Corylus avellana), <b>wayfaring</b> <b>tree</b> (Viburnum lantana) and other small woody shoots. Some still have flint arrow-heads preserved; others have blunt wooden ends for hunting birds and small game. The ends show traces of fletching, which was {{fastened}} on with birch-tar.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{a sloping}} dry chalk bank, which has {{a wide variety of}} plants, {{butterflies}} and birds. Plants include the pyramidal and man orchids, and the greater yellow-rattle, which is rare nationally. Over 100 species of moth and 36 of butterfly have been recorded. It also has scrub with wild privet, dogwood and the <b>wayfaring</b> <b>tree.</b> Sheep graze on the grassland as part of the Surrey Downs Project.|$|E
50|$|Patches of scrub with {{emergent}} {{tree species}} have developed on slopes, common components {{of which are}} hawthorn (Crataegus sp.), buckthorn (Rhamnus spp.), blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), common holly (Ilex aquifolium), <b>wayfaring</b> <b>tree</b> (Viburnum lantana), ash (Fraxinus excelsior), whitebeam and field maple (Acer campestre). Ash and wych elm (Ulmus glabra) form two stands on north-facing slopes on the eastern margins of the downs. The ground cover in these woods contains several species typical of those found in ancient woodland.|$|E
50|$|Birdlime from Damascus was {{supposed}} to be made of sebestens, their kernels being frequently found in it; this version was not able to endure frost or wet. That brought from Spain was said to have a bad odor. That of the Italians was made of mistletoe berries, heated, mixed with oil, as before; to make it water resistant, they added turpentine. It was said that the bark of the <b>wayfaring</b> <b>tree</b> (Viburnum lantana) made birdlime as good as the best.|$|E
50|$|A {{large part}} of the site is covered by broadleaved {{woodland}} with sessile oak, ash and sycamore among the dominant tree species. Notable plants in the woods include stinking hellebore, green-flowered helleborine and <b>wayfaring</b> <b>tree.</b> There are also areas of calcareous grassland with plants such as bloody cranesbill and lesser meadow-rue. Much of the site lies on an escarpment of Carboniferous limestone and there are three cave systems: Ogof Hesp Alyn, Ogof Hen Ffynhonnau and Ogof Nadolig. Lead ore, zinc ore, limestone and calcite were formerly mined in the area.|$|E
50|$|The site {{includes}} an extensive stand of juniper Juniperus communis, privet Ligustrum vulgare, buckthorn Rhamnus catharticus, rose Rosa spp., bramble Rubus spp., <b>wayfaring</b> <b>tree</b> Viburnum lantana and hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) and whitebeam Sorbus aria, which covers circa 20 ha to the west-facing slopes. There {{is little evidence}} of juniper regeneration (and some moribund bushes) and the site is probably witnessing a transition from juniper to a mixed scrub community, with the early indications of an eventual succession of woodland. The scrub is unusual on the chalk in lacking a yew Taxus baccata and ash Fraxinus excelsior component.|$|E

5000|$|Described by Natural England as a Site of Special Scientific Interest having [...] "one of {{the best}} {{remaining}} examples of wet ash-maple woodland in Bedfordshire", Hanger Wood is an ancient semi-natural woodland that retains characteristics of its coppice-with-standards historic management regime; the wood is located on poorly drained soils of boulder clay and was notified as an SSSI in 1988 under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Hanger Wood's canopy is dominated by mature penduculate oak (Quercus robur) and ash (Fraxinus excelsior) standards, with midland hawthorn (Crataegus laevigata) as well as hazel (Corylus avellana) coppice dominating the shrub layer. <b>Wayfaring</b> <b>tree</b> (Viburnum lantana) and spindle (Euonymus europaeus) are largely restricted to {{the margins of the}} wood, whilst blackthorn (Prunus spinosa) can be found forming dense thickets.|$|E

The agar diffusion method was used to examine the antimicrobial activities of the extracted EO. All the EO tested showed antibacterial properties against one or more strains while none of the EO was active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Viburnum lantana (<b>Wayfaring</b> <b>tree),</b> Annona muricata (Soursop), Coleus amboinicus (Spanish thyme) and Cinnamomum zeylancium (Cinnamon) showed good inhibition against both Gram- positive and Gram-negative bacteria and proved as worthy source of antimicrobial agent.

40|$|Individuals of the shrub species Viburnum lantana L. (<b>wayfaring</b> <b>tree)</b> {{treated with}} ozone (60 ppb for 45 days for 5 hours per day) or {{maintained}} in filtered air (control) were analyzed through {{suppression subtractive hybridization}} (SSH) {{in order to assess}} the main differences of induced (I) and repressed (R) libraries, representing the response of plants at a biological, cellular, and molecular level. Biomolecular procedures consisted of: RNA extraction, PCR select (SSH), and 454 cDNA library sequencing. A total of 38 800 and 12 495 high quality reads were assembled (Newbler and CAP 3 softwares) after filtering for the induced and repressed libraries, resulting in a total of 543 and 705 UniGenes, respectively. Functional annotation and gene ontology assignment were used to define the different relevance of gene ontology (GO) categories in the libraries. Results showed an enrichment of GO categories involved in the defense to oxidative stress for the induced library, with an increase in glutathione (GSH), thioredoxin- 1 (Trx 1), and heat shock proteins (HSP).

40|$|A {{specific}} sediment {{sampling strategy}} {{was applied to}} a late Neolithic settlement phase (dendrodated to around 3160 BC) in the pile-dwelling site of Parkhaus Opéra (Zürich, Switzerland). It consisted in a systematic collection of over 2100 large-volume samples (3 – 10 L) {{in an area of}} ∼ 3000 m 2, of which 255 were selected for archaeobotanical analysis. Over 80, 000 plant macroremains of large size (> 2 mm) were recovered and a rich assemblage of large-seeded wild fruits was evaluated. Hazelnuts (Corylus avellana L.), acorns (Quercus sp.), apples/pears (Malus/Pyrus), sloes (Prunus spinosa L.), wild rose fruits (Rosa sp.), beech nuts (Fagus sp.) and <b>wayfaring</b> <b>tree</b> fruits (Viburnum lantana L.) were among the most frequently and abundantly gathered and consumed wild fruits at the settlement. Three methods of quantification were used to evaluate their importance in the economy taking into account the samples retrieved from 16 fully excavated structures: total average density of fruit items, total estimated amount of fruits, and their calorific contribution. The estimation of the caloric importance of large-seeded wild fruits depends on assumptions on taphonomic biases. A first estimation suggested that they probably provided between 1. 5 % and 15 % of the total calorific input by the settlement's inhabitants...|$|E
40|$|Tropospheric ozone {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} phytotoxic air pollutant. Biomonitoring by native plants is an option when the assessment of its impact on vegetation in large-scale surveys and in remote areas is of concern. The shrub species Viburnum lantana L. (<b>wayfaring</b> <b>tree)</b> is known to be sensitive to ozone, develops specific symptoms consisting in red stipples on the upper surface, and has a wide spatial distribution. However it is not fully known if it meets all the requirements to be used as an in situ bioindicator (Doley, 2010). In particular, the actual responsiveness to ozone of native plants and the relationship between the intensity of responses and the levels of exposure to the pollutant under field conditions remain to be evaluated. For these purposes, two field studies were carried out in Trentino (North Italy) at local (1) and large scale (2). (1) Firstly, at local level, we considered two 1 x 1 km quadrates characterized by different ozone levels. A fully randomized design was adopted to ensure within-quadrate replications and to select V. lantana plants for the monitoring of ozone-specific foliar symptoms development, the chlorophyll (Chl) content and the fluorescence of Chl a during the entire growing season. (2) Secondly, a stratified (elevation x ozone) random design was used to test the response of V. lantana in terms of symptomatic plant percentage at larger scale (6200 km 2). Overall, the results of the two field studies allowed to verify a temporal development of the responses of V. lantana consistent with the trend of ozone exposure (Gottardini et al., 2010), and an higher frequency of symptomatic plants where ozone levels were also higher. However, the frequency of symptoms was not always proportionate to the level of ozone exposure. At the same time of the onset and spread of foliar symptoms, a decrease in the foliar Chl content and in photosynthetic performance occurred. V. lantana seems suitable as a bioindicator in situ to qualitatively assess the potential impact of ozone...|$|E
40|$|Tropospheric ozone {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} phytotoxic air pollutant. The exceedance of Critical Levels set to protect vegetation are quite common in Trentino so that large parts of forests result exposed to potentially harmful levels of ozone. While the potential impact of this pollutant on vegetation is high, its real impact can be assessed in terms of foliar symptoms at the meso- and large-scale and in remote areas by means of ozone-sensitive species. In a previous study, we demonstrated the potential of Viburnum lantana L. (<b>wayfaring</b> <b>tree)</b> for field studies (Gottardini et al., 2010, J. Env. Monit. 12, 2237 - 2243) : it is well known as ozone sensitive, it develops specific, unambiguous foliar symptoms (consisting of interveinal red-purple stippling on upper leaf surface) consistently with the trend of ozone exposure; it is widely distributed across the Alps. On this basis, a new, meso-scale study was launched to investigate whether – under field conditions - consistency exists between ozone exposure levels and response intensity of V. lantana in Trentino, northern Italy. To this purpose, a stratified random sampling design (elevation x ozone) was adopted to select 30 1 x 1 km quadrates on the entire surface of the Trento province (6, 200 km 2). The assessment of symptomatic plants was carried out in 2010 within each quadrate and repeated in 2012 on a subset of 10 quadrates. The frequency of symptomatic plants was higher where ozone levels were also higher. When comparing similar ranges of ozone exposures, symptomatic plants were always more frequent at higher altitude. However, the frequency of symptoms was not always proportionate to the level of ozone exposure. The lack of a statistically significant dose-effect relationship may reflect the complexity of ozone-plant interaction and the inherent large variability of biological response in field conditions. This is, however, the potential of the native bioindicator plants: the ability to identify potentially impacted (or protected) areas beyond the mere values of ozone exposure. In these terms, foliar symptoms on V. lantana are valid response indicators of ozone, suitable for large-scale surveys and on native vegetation in mountain forests...|$|E
