5|$|The Douglas Aircraft Company {{designed}} {{a system that}} would prevent the accidental reversal of propeller blades in-flight. During development of the DC-6, the company installed a system that cut electrical power to the mechanisms which rotated the blades while the airplane was in the air. When there was enough weight on the landing gear (which would only be the case when the aircraft was on the ground), a switch which supplied electrical power to the mechanisms was closedmeaning that when the aircraft touched down the blades could be reversed and thus the airplane could be slowed. When the switch was closed, a red flag would swing into view in the cockpit of the aircraft, warning the crew that the blades could be reversed. Should the switch fail to close upon landing, the flag could be raised manually and electrical power to the mechanisms would be restored. When the aircraft took off, electrical power would be cut to the mechanisms so that the propeller blades could not be inadvertently reversed, and the red flag swung out of sight. Reverse thrust <b>warning</b> <b>lamps,</b> which would have warned the crew if the propellers were reversed, were not fitted on Mainliner Idaho.|$|E
25|$|One {{potential}} problem with flashing stop lamps in the United States (and Canada) is the regulations that permit flashing stop lamps {{to be used}} in lieu of separate rear turn signal and hazard <b>warning</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The S50 {{was sold}} in some markets with an A150 designation. In European markets (and other export markets), it was also marketed as the PMC-Mikado A150. The S50-2 was also sold as the S56SE A190D, which was {{equipped}} with the [...] 1.9 liter D-6 OHV diesel engine. This model had trim and equipment levels similar to the S50S-2. In Europe, period testers commented on the car's compact size (more like a 1.0 than a 1.5) and its sprightly performance, in large {{part due to the}} extremely low gearing. The car's ample lighting was also noted, offering twin headlights, a bevy of <b>warning</b> <b>lamps,</b> numerous engine room light fittings, etcetera. Also lauded were the cars road manners, as evident by the six-cylinder Skyline's competition successes.|$|E
50|$|The oil {{pressure}} gauge, or <b>warning</b> <b>lamp,</b> gives only the pressure {{at the point}} where its sender enters that part of the pressurized system - not everywhere, not an average, nor a generalized picture of the systemic pressure.|$|R
25|$|The 2008 TL {{features}} an improved new immobilizer system, {{and a separate}} Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) <b>warning</b> <b>lamp.</b> The navigation system has been updated to work in Hawaii, and the AcuraLink satellite capability has been expanded to incorporate 76 markets (up from 38 markets for the 2007 model).|$|R
50|$|On the new C3, the {{instrumentation}} {{is a mix}} of analogue dials {{beneath a}} styled cowl and a digital display for the fuel and trip computer. There is no temperature gauge (unlike the DS3), but a red and blue <b>warning</b> <b>lamp</b> to show hot or cold engines which come on as required. The drag coefficient is 0.307 Cd.|$|R
2500|$|Emergency {{vehicles}} such as fire engines, ambulances, police cars, snow-removal {{vehicles and}} tow trucks are usually equipped with intense warning lights of particular colours. These may be motorised rotating beacons, xenon strobes, or arrays of LEDs. The prescribed colours differ by jurisdiction; in most countries, {{blue and red}} special <b>warning</b> <b>lamps</b> are used on police, fire, and medical-emergency vehicles. In the United States and some other jurisdictions, amber lights are for tow trucks, private security personnel, construction vehicles, and other nonofficial special-service vehicles, while volunteer firefighters use red, blue, or green, depending on jurisdiction. In the U.S. it {{is a violation of}} the D.O.T. (Department of Transportation) Uniform Vehicle Code for any non-emergency vehicle (Police/Fire/Ambulance) to operate forward-facing red lights of any kind. Cars in the U.S. only have red tail-lights, and no blue lights; a vehicle displaying a red (forward-facing) light (flashing or not) coming towards a driver, or from behind the driver (in rear view mirror) indicates that an official emergency vehicle is coming, requiring the driver to yield, pull {{off to the side of}} the road, or otherwise get out of its way. [...] Some U.S. States allow emergency vehicles to have blue lights that can be turned on to warn drivers of an emergency vehicle in action; blue and red lights can be combined, forward- and/or rear-facing, also. [...] In the UK, doctors may use green <b>warning</b> <b>lamps</b> although these do not allow the user to claim any exemption from road traffic regulations compared to the blue lights used by statutory emergency services when responding to calls. Special warning lights, usually amber, are also sometimes mounted on slow and/or wide vehicles such as mobile cranes, excavators, tractors, and even mobility scooters in certain conditions.|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{it became}} {{possible}} to carry a light, Bailey went to the barn and brought the team to the door. Rivers helped Blanche to {{a seat in the}} wagon and drove off across the plain, leaving Bailey alone in the water-soaked store-room. After a half-hour's work he, too, set out on a tour of exploration. The moon was shining on the plain as serenely as if only a dew had fallen. Water stood in shallow basins here and there, but the land was unmarked of the passion of lightning and of wind. Bailey walked across the level waste, straining his eyes ahead to see if the homes of his neighbors were still standing. He saw lights gleaming here and there like <b>warning</b> <b>lamps</b> of distant schooners, and when the infrequent, silent lightning flamed over the level waste, he caught glimpses of familiar shanties standing on the low swells.|$|E

50|$|The mandate did, however, {{provide a}} minimum {{standard}} {{for the type of}} data that EDRs would be required to record: at least 15 types of crash data. Some of the required crash data include pre-crash speed, engine throttle, brake use, measured changes in forward velocity (Delta-V), driver safety belt use, airbag <b>warning</b> <b>lamp</b> status and airbag deployment times.|$|R

50|$|An {{annunciator}} panel, {{also known}} in some aircraft as the Centralized Warning Panel (CWP), {{is a group}} of lights used as a central indicator of status of equipment or systems in an aircraft, industrial process, building or other installation. Usually, the annunciator panel includes a main <b>warning</b> <b>lamp</b> or audible signal to draw the attention of operating personnel to the annunciator panel for abnormal events or conditions.|$|R
50|$|KUV {{standard}} {{features include}} dual front airbags {{for the safety}} of driver and co-driver, Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) with Electronic Brake-Force Distribution (EBD) and front seat belt pretensioners which ensure the safety of all its occupants. The other safety features are collapsible steering column, child safety locks on rear doors, speed sensing automatic door locks, automatic hazard <b>warning</b> <b>lamps</b> on panic braking or bonnet opening, automatic hazard <b>warning</b> <b>lamps</b> on crash, anti-theft security alarm, anti-slip clips for driver side floor mat, ISOFIX child seat mount on rear seat.|$|E

50|$|There are red {{aircraft}} <b>warning</b> <b>lamps</b> (six sets of two lights) up {{the mast}} with two lights on top. The lights were upgraded in February 2007 {{to comply with}} CAA 2000 Air Navigation Order, designed to prevent low flying aircraft from hitting the mast.|$|E
5000|$|Water {{temperature}} gauge {{is replaced by}} <b>warning</b> <b>lamp</b> on dashboard, grille shield is replaced by lion.The optional automatic transmission (which is now 6 positions: PRN 3 2 1) is available {{until the end of}} 1974.In May 1975, production of European passenger models ceased. [...] By this time Peugeot customers in Europe strongly favoured the newer 304 and 504 models, and French 404 production was much reduced, with only 15,780 - all berlines/saloons/sedans produced during the first five months of 1975.|$|R
5000|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the use of}} {{blue lights}} is {{regulated}} by the Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations 1989, and sirens by the Road Vehicles Construction and Use Regulations 1986, both as amended by various other pieces of legislation (see right). The 1989 restrictions state that no vehicle, other than an emergency vehicle, shall be fitted with a [...] "blue warning beacon or special warning lamp", or a device which resembles a blue warning beacon or a special <b>warning</b> <b>lamp,</b> whether it works or not.|$|R
5000|$|The field {{windings}} are supplied with {{power from the}} battery via the ignition switch and regulator. A parallel circuit supplies the [...] "charge" [...] warning indicator and is earthed via the regulator (which is why the indicator is on when the ignition is on but the engine is not running). Once the engine is running and the alternator is generating power, a diode feeds the field current from the alternator main output equalizing the voltage across the warning indicator which goes off. The wire supplying the field current {{is often referred to}} as the [...] "exciter" [...] wire. The drawback of this arrangement is that if the <b>warning</b> <b>lamp</b> burns out or the [...] "exciter" [...] wire is disconnected, no current reaches the {{field windings}} and the alternator will not generate power. Some warning indicator circuits are equipped with a resistor in parallel with the lamp that permit excitation current to flow if the <b>warning</b> <b>lamp</b> burns out. The driver should check that the warning indicator is on when the engine is stopped; otherwise, there might not be any indication of a failure of the belt which may also drive the cooling water pump. Some alternators will self-excite when the engine reaches a certain speed.|$|R
50|$|Tall {{structures}} {{in excess of}} certain legislated heights are often equipped with aircraft <b>warning</b> <b>lamps,</b> usually red, to warn pilots of the structure's existence. In the past, ruggedized and under-run filament lamps were used to maximize the bulb life. Alternatively, neon lamps were used. Nowadays such lamps tend to use LED arrays.|$|E
50|$|For safety reasons, {{access to}} the public is only {{permissible}} when the ranges are not in operation. Large red flags are flown and flashing <b>warning</b> <b>lamps</b> on Bindon Hill and St Alban's Head are lit when the ranges are in use. At such times the entrance gates are locked and wardens patrol the area.|$|E
50|$|Isolation {{transformers}} {{are also}} used for the power supply of devices not at ground potential. An example is the Austin transformer for the power supply of air-traffic obstacle <b>warning</b> <b>lamps</b> on radio antenna masts. Without the isolation transformer, the lighting circuits on the mast would conduct radio-frequency energy to ground through the power supply.|$|E
5000|$|Moreover, Chrysler {{seemed not}} to support the model after the launch. Advertising was scanty and updates scarce and rather limited in scope. Chrysler {{did not bother to}} fit the {{supposedly}} upmarket model with such features as power windows, central locking, ( [...] though a then-unusual fitment was a low fuel <b>warning</b> <b>lamp</b> which would come on when a couple of gallons of fuel was left in the tank [...] ), even though they were all available in the smaller Simca 1307, launched around the time when the 180 was in mid-life.|$|R
50|$|Commercial flash pots include safety {{features}} such as <b>warning</b> pilot <b>lamps,</b> preignition grounding, and safing circuits. They also use isolated and low-voltage power sources, and have keyed power connections to help prevent accidental ignition.|$|R
2500|$|The {{simplest}} form {{of lighting}} is a steadily burning lamp. [...] These may be white lights used on scene to enable emergency workers {{to see what}} they are doing, or they may be colored lights that advertise the emergency vehicle’s presence. [...] In the latter case, steadily burning lights are often used alongside rotating or flashing lights rather than on their own, though historically some emergency vehicles only displayed steadily burning lights. [...] For example, California Vehicle Code Section 25252 states: “Every authorized emergency vehicle shall be equipped with at least one steady burning red <b>warning</b> <b>lamp</b> visible from at least 1,000 feet {{to the front of the}} vehicle” ...|$|R
5000|$|The mast of Deutschlandsender Herzberg/Elster had no {{aircraft}} <b>warning</b> <b>lamps</b> installed. It {{was instead}} lit by skybeamers mounted on small masts near the tower. This method {{was chosen as}} the mast was a mast radiator insulated against ground and for feeding the lamps on the mast otherwise special devices like Austin transformers would be required.|$|E
5000|$|Exterior {{differences}} were virtually unchanged, though all 1972 models were revised with [...] "Fasten Seat Belt" [...] <b>warning</b> <b>lamps</b> {{on the right}} side dash panel. The [...] "Decor Group" [...] exterior trim package was also revised, allowing coupe and convertible owners to option their car with tu-tone lower body paint, plus the honeycomb sportlamp grille from the Mach 1/Boss 351 and the Mach 1's urethane bumper.|$|E
50|$|The Diablo range also {{received}} an updated interior. Instead {{of the traditional}} flat dashboard with a separate upright instrument binnacle, as in many Italian sports cars of the era (and the previous Diablo), the new dash was an integrated wave-shaped design. A thin strip of black glass {{ran the length of}} the dash and contained various instrument indicator and <b>warning</b> <b>lamps.</b> This aesthetic design was inspired by Bang & Olufsen Hi-Fi products.|$|E
50|$|A {{shift light}} is a <b>warning</b> <b>lamp</b> fitted to {{vehicles}} {{in order to}} indicate to the driver that maximum RPM has almost been reached. Ideally a shift lamp will illuminate at the engine speed beyond that which delivers the maximum BHP such that the BHP before and after shifting is the same. Accelerating the engine beyond this point is not conducive to rapid acceleration. In use a shift light allows the driver to judge the exact point that a gear change should be carried out without having to glance down at the tachometer. This also increases safety for the driver by keeping his focus on the track at all times.|$|R
5000|$|A new {{optional}} feature for the 1978 Mark V was the [...] "Miles-To-Empty" [...] indicator. This {{was a small}} rectangular display, located {{to the right of}} the steering wheel, which sat in place of the standard equipment [...] "low fuel" [...] <b>warning</b> <b>lamp.</b> The amber LED readout would indicate the estimated distance (in miles) available before reaching empty based on remaining fuel, fuel consumption, and driving habits. This system was a precursor to the electronic digital full-instrumentation which would be available on the 1980 Continental Mark VI. The system represents a first for an American automobile manufacturer, as it is the first dashboard LED display of an automobile's mechanical function.|$|R

50|$|Sigma SE offered {{equipment}} including five-position, reclining rear seats. An interior {{boot lid}} release, roof console (incorporating dome lamp, map reading lamp, seat belt and door ajar <b>warning</b> <b>lamps),</b> steel belt radial ply tyres, laminated windscreen, distinctive grille, smoked glass on all instrument dials, front seat back pockets, and Ivanhoe cloth trim were also standard with the SE (with leather optional). The SE was further distinguished by its body-coloured hubcaps with silver trim.|$|E
5000|$|Also in 1979, Zastava {{launched}} the 101S (Super) and SC (Super Confort). They had new bumpers, square headlamps, a new radiator grille with chrome surround, black side mirror, black wipers, small black wheel caps, standard rear defroster and two new <b>warning</b> <b>lamps</b> (hand-brake on, brake-pad warning). Interior colors were added, as was a new, 1,290 cc engine, featuring 9.1:1 compression and an IPM 32 MGV 25/250 carburetor. The SC model used a two-barrel Weber 30/32 DMTR 90/250 carburetor and 4-2-1 exhaust, boosting power to [...]|$|E
50|$|A mast {{radiator}} {{may need}} various electrical connections {{other than the}} transmitter feed line. Such connections include static drain chokes (which drain off static charges caused by wind, clouds, etc.), spark-gap balls for lightning protection, power supplies for aircraft <b>warning</b> <b>lamps,</b> and coaxial feeders for ancillary antennas mounted on the mast. A variety of techniques are used to 'isolate' these connections from the high RF voltage on the mast, such as chokes, parallel tuned circuits and coupling loops, on a base-fed mast. On a shunt-fed mast, where the base is grounded, such measures are unnecessary.|$|E
5000|$|Randle {{was born}} in Aspull, near Wigan, Lancashire, to an {{unmarried}} Rhoda Heathcoate Hughes. He left school aged 13 and worked {{in a variety of}} menial jobs until two years later when he joined an acrobatic troupe. He took the name Arthur McEvoy after his mother married Richard McEvoy. In 1928 Randle began to tour as a comedian, principally in Lancashire and Northern England. Randle appeared on stage carrying a red <b>warning</b> <b>lamp,</b> similar to the type found around road works, declaring [...] "Look what some dam'd fool left in t'road". He developed his own show, Randle's Scandals, which in the 1950s featured Roy Castle.|$|R
50|$|In {{normal use}} the three {{channels}} were mixed onto the IC for monitoring. The commander or operator could select the A or B sets {{to remove them}} from the IC and allow push-to-talk. A <b>warning</b> <b>lamp</b> would light if both were on the B set, leaving the A set uncontrolled. The other crew members could only use the IC. The driver's push button incorporated a buzzer, allowing the commander's attention to be {{brought back to the}} IC if a situation requiring his attention arose. Later control boxes allowed the commander or operator to rebroadcast A onto B or vice-versa for message relay. Command and link/relay vehicles had provision to operate two A sets, one of which could be a high-power variant.|$|R
50|$|In most {{locomotives}} (in {{addition to}} a <b>warning</b> <b>lamp</b> or buzzer being sounded) the master controller undergoes auto-regression, with the notches falling to zero rapidly as the locomotive's motive power is switched off. The guard may also notice the loss of brake pressure (although he/she may not know it {{is due to the}} pulling of the alarm chain) and is expected to apply their brakes immediately as well. It is possible for a driver to override the alarm-chain pull; this is done where it is known that miscreants resort to pulling the emergency chain solely to get the train to stop at a point convenient for themselves. However, such an act by the driver (or guard) of deliberately ignoring an indication of alarm-chain pulling is a serious matter.|$|R
