2500|$|<b>What</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> most {{influence}} over happiness are internal {{factors such as}} genetics, personality traits, and {{internal locus of control}} [...] It is theorized that 50% of the variation in happiness levels is from genetic sources and is known as the genetic set point. The genetic set point is assumed to be stable over time, fixed, and immune to influence or control. This goes along with findings that well-being surveys have a naturally positive baseline.|$|E
2500|$|The {{injuries}} that [...] Adams cited {{in order to}} collect millions of tax-free dollars from a law-enforcement disability pension did not stop him from taking rigorous spinning classes and running in a 5K race, the Glendale Downtown Dash, in 2009. Nor did it stop him from stating on an 2008 application for Orange County sheriff, that he likes to ski and {{had been in the}} 120-mile Baker to Las Vegas Relay run. When Adams applied for Orange County sheriff, the year before joining Bell, he did not mention having any physical problems, said Rick Francis, chief of staff for county Supervisor John Moorlach. [...] "He was not disabled", said Glendale City Manager Jim Starbird, who was Adams' boss until he left for Bell. [...] "I never heard of someone being hired to work for a city and having that [...] determination made going in." [...] Glendale has joined two other cities in trying to block <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> potential to be {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} in pension payments for Adams, whose highly profitable term as police chief of Bell has far-reaching consequences to the state's complicated employee retirement system. Adams' salary of $457,000 was roughly double that of Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck who oversees almost 10,000 officers. Bell's police department numbers 48.|$|E
2500|$|A race, {{from the}} {{biological}} standpoint, may therefore {{be defined as}} one of the group of populations constituting the species Homo sapiens"… [...] "National, religious, geographic, linguistic and cult groups do not necessary coincide with racial groups: the cultural traits of such groups have no demonstrated genetic connexion with racial traits. Because serious errors of this kind are habitually committed when the term 'race' is used in popular parlance, it would be better when speaking of human races to drop the term 'race' altogether and speak of ethnic groups"… [...] "Now <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>the</b> scientist to say about the groups of mankind which may be recognized at the present time? Human races can be and have been differently classified by different anthropologists, but at the present time most anthropologists agree on classifying the greater part of present-day mankind into three major divisions, as follows: The Mongoloid Division; The Negroid Division; The Caucasoid Division." [...] … [...] "Catholics, Protestants, Moslems and Jews are not races … The biological fact of race and the myth of 'race' should be distinguished. For all practical social purposes 'race' {{is not so much a}} biological phenomenon as a social myth. The myth 'race' has created an enormous amount of human and social damage. In recent years it has taken a heavy toll in human lives and caused untold suffering. It still prevents the normal development of millions of human beings and deprives civilization of the effective co-operation of productive minds. The biological differences between ethnic groups should be disregarded from the standpoint of social acceptance and social action. The unity of mankind from both the biological and social viewpoint is the main thing. To recognize this and to act accordingly is the first requirement of modern man … ...|$|E
