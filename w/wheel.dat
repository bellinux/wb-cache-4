5|$|Although {{longitudinally}} stable when stationary, bikes {{often have}} a high enough center of mass and a short enough wheelbase to lift a <b>wheel</b> off the ground under sufficient acceleration or deceleration. When braking, depending on {{the location of the}} combined center of mass of the bike and rider with respect {{to the point where the}} front <b>wheel</b> contacts the ground, bikes can either skid the front <b>wheel</b> or flip the bike and rider over the front <b>wheel.</b> A similar situation is possible while accelerating, but with respect to the rear <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
5|$|The farther forward (closer {{to front}} <b>wheel)</b> {{the center of}} mass of the {{combined}} bike and rider, the less the front <b>wheel</b> has to move laterally {{in order to maintain}} balance. Conversely, the farther back (closer to the rear <b>wheel)</b> the center of mass is located, the more front <b>wheel</b> lateral movement or bike forward motion is required to regain balance. This can be noticeable on long-wheelbase recumbents, choppers, and wheelie bikes. It can also be a challenge for touring bikes that carry a heavy load of gear over or even behind the rear <b>wheel.</b> Mass over the rear <b>wheel</b> can be more easily controlled if it is lower than mass over the front <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{pumping station}} {{operated}} continuously, providing {{water for the}} increasing traffic on the canal. Problems {{with the size of}} the water <b>wheel,</b> which was supported at either end, meant that the middle of the <b>wheel</b> sagged, putting strain on the bearings and stays. In the 1840s the trussing was changed from stays to tension rods to strengthen and lighten the <b>wheel,</b> along with improvements to the pumps. The changes to the <b>wheel</b> were unsuccessful, and in the 1850s a central bearing was added dividing the <b>wheel</b> in two.|$|E

50|$|Taking {{into account}} their {{generally}} inferior quality compared to forged <b>wheels,</b> the main advantage of cast <b>wheels</b> is {{the relatively low}} cost of production. And although cast <b>wheels</b> are more affordable than forged <b>wheels,</b> cast <b>wheels</b> {{are designed to be}} heavier than forged <b>wheels</b> for a given required load. Manufacturing defects found in cast <b>wheels</b> include cavities or porosity and a different metallurgical microstructure, entailing larger grain size. Cast <b>wheels</b> will tend to fracture upon overbearing high-speed impact, whereas forged <b>wheels</b> will tend to bend.|$|R
5|$|Without the docking-pit, the {{caissons}} and extremities of {{the arms}} of the <b>wheel</b> would be immersed in water at the lower canal basin each time the <b>wheel</b> rotated. The buoyancy of the lower caisson would {{make it more difficult to}} turn the <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} how easy or difficult a bike {{will be to}} ride is trail, the distance that the front <b>wheel</b> ground contact point trails behind the steering axis ground contact point. The steering axis is the axis about which the entire steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, front <b>wheel,</b> etc.) pivots. In traditional bike designs, with a steering axis tilted back from the vertical, positive trail tends to steer the front <b>wheel</b> into {{the direction of a}} lean, independent of forward speed. This can be simulated by pushing a stationary bike to one side. The front <b>wheel</b> will usually also steer to that side. In a lean, gravity provides this force. The dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated, however, and other factors can contribute to or detract from this effect.|$|E

5|$|During the Song dynasty {{there was}} also great amount of {{attention}} given to the building of efficient automotive vessels known as paddle <b>wheel</b> craft. The latter had been known in China perhaps since the 5th century, and certainly by the Tang dynasty in 784 with the successful paddle <b>wheel</b> warship design of Li Gao. In 1134 the Deputy Transport Commissioner of Zhejiang, Wu Ge, had paddle <b>wheel</b> warships constructed {{with a total of}} nine wheels and others with thirteen wheels. However, there were paddle <b>wheel</b> ships in the Song that were so large that 12 wheels were featured {{on each side of the}} vessel. In 1135 the famous general Yue Fei (1103–1142) ambushed a force of rebels under Yang Yao, entangling their paddle <b>wheel</b> craft by filling a lake with floating weeds and rotting logs, thus allowing them to board their ships and gain a strategic victory. In 1161, gunpowder bombs and paddle <b>wheel</b> crafts were used effectively by the Song Chinese at the Battle of Tangdao and the Battle of Caishi along the Yangtze River against the Jurchen Jin dynasty during the Jin–Song Wars. The Jurchen invasion, led by Wanyan Liang (the Prince of Hailing), failed to conquer the Southern Song. In 1183 the Nanjing naval commander Chen Tang was given a reward for constructing ninety paddle <b>wheel</b> craft and other warships. In 1176, Emperor Xiaozong of Song (r. 1162–1189) issued an imperial order to the Nanjing official Guo Gang (who desired to convert damaged paddle <b>wheel</b> craft into junk ships and galleys) not to limit the number of paddle <b>wheel</b> craft in the navy's dockyards, since he had high esteem for the fast assault craft that won the Chinese victory at Caishi. However, paddle <b>wheel</b> craft found other uses besides effective assaults in warfare. The Arab or Persian Commissioner of Merchant Shipping for Quanzhou, the Muslim Pu Shougeng (who served from 1250 to 1275) noted that paddle <b>wheel</b> ships were also used by the Chinese as tugboats for towing.|$|E

5|$|The net {{aerodynamic}} drag forces {{may be considered}} to act at a single point, called the center of pressure.
