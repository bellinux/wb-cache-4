25|$|In early 2000, the {{national}} government developed two key policy instruments to control wastewater pollution. First, the National Plan for Municipal <b>Wastewater</b> <b>Management</b> (PMAR), which provides a framework for the rapid evolution of <b>wastewater</b> <b>management</b> programs in the large urban areas. This national plan promotes coordinated <b>wastewater</b> <b>management</b> at the local, regional, and national levels by focusing on institutional strengthening {{and the application of}} existing planning tools. Furthermore, it promotes the construction of wastewater treatment systems in municipalities with adequate water and sewerage service and with prioritized high impact watersheds, including Río Bogotá, Río Chicamocha, Río Medellin and Río Cauca. Second, the Sanitation and Management of Wastewater Discharge Plan (Plan de Saneamiento y Manejo de Vertimientos, PSMV), which mandates that the service providers indicate programs, projects and activities following an implementation schedule and investment plan aimed at reducing pollution loads in receiving waters and improving wastewater collection in municipal sewer systems. PSMV’s action plans are aligned with other planning instruments, for instance water quality objectives defined by the environmental authority, as well as master plans and investment plans set by the municipalities. These two national policies have been instrumental to support the recent increase of wastewater programs in large cities in Colombia.|$|E
40|$|<b>Wastewater</b> {{planning}} <b>management</b> is {{a complex}} problem involving agricultural, rural and industrial interests. In countries facing rapid population growth, identifying methods that can allow them to take good decisions among several competitive alternatives is of utmost importance. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present a methodology for a <b>wastewater</b> planning <b>management</b> system using a Multi-criterion Decision-making (MCDM) method based on utility function. It allows one to take into account a multiple conflicting multi criterion context in terms of objective specification, criteria, criterion scales and construction of a payoff matrix that consists of the alternative versus criteria array. These objectives deal with groundwater protection, effluent quality, wastewater reuse, system reliability and resources needed. A number of wastewater treatment techniques are presented as alternative action plans from which the most satisfying alternative is to be chosen. In order to select on appropriate management scheme, we propose to use the UTA (Utility Additive) method. This method is interactive and permits the decision maker (DM) to select the best solution according to his viewpoint. The UTA method proceeds in two steps: the assessment of optimal utility using piecewise linear programming techniques and sensitive analysis using a post- optimal procedure. An application of UTA method in <b>wastewater</b> planning <b>management</b> system is presented for the first time and some extensions of the method are discussed.

40|$|The world {{relies on}} major fossil fuels {{including}} oil and gas, which are predicted to deplete by 2042. At this critical stage, {{there is a}} dire need to look for alternative energy sources to reduce the dependency on fossil fuels. Rapid Industrialisation {{on the other hand}} has made the implementation of <b>wastewater</b> <b>managements</b> to be crucial even though it is energy intensive and money consuming. It has been known for the past decades that bacteria could be used to generate electricity from many substrates as in Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC). Thus, MFC could be a solution for environmental <b>wastewater</b> <b>managements</b> {{and at the same time}} would be able to solve the energy crisis by producing power. Platinum (Pt) for the past years has been widely used as the cathode catalyst to accelerate ORR and electron acceptance. Nevertheless, there is always been a driving force to produce a low-cost non precious metal catalyst for the cathode of a MFC. This work presents a preparation of non-precious iron-based electro catalyst responsible for ORR for air-cathode microbial fuel cell. Catalyst is synthesised by mixing Iron oxalate (recovered from industrial waste) and Phenanthroline in ethanol solution before being calcined under N 2 atmosphere at 800 ⁰C for 2 hours. The cathode was fabricated by coating the catalyst. Performance of the iron-based catalyst was investigated in a single chamber air-cathode MFC where palm oil mill effluent (POME) was used as the anode substrate and anaerobic sludge as inoculums. The maximum Open Circuit Voltage recorded was 0. 543 mV and the highest Power density drawn was 4. 9 mW/m 2 after 5 days. The physical properties of the catalyst were characterized via Brunauer Emmett Teller(BET), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Field Emmision Scanning Electron Microsopy (FESEM) analysis and the electrochemical properties was characterized by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) analysis.

40|$|The {{treatment}} {{efficiency of}} laboratory wastewaters was evaluated and ecotoxicity tests with Chlorella vulgaris {{were performed on}} them to assess {{the safety of their}} environmental discharge. For chemical oxygen demand wastewaters, chromium (VI), mercury (II) and silver were efficiently removedby chemical treatments. Areduction of ecotoxicitywas achieved; nevertheless, an EC 50 (effective concentration that causes a 50 % inhibition in the algae growth) of 1. 5 % (v/v) indicated still high level of ecotoxicity. For chloride determination wastewaters, an efficient reduction of chromium and silver was achieved after treatment. Regarding the reduction of ecotoxicity observed, EC 50 increased from 0. 059 % to 0. 5 %, only a 0. 02 % concentration in the aquatic environment would guarantee no effects. Wastewaters containing phenanthroline/iron (II) complex were treated by chemical oxidation. Treatmentwas satisfactory concerning chemical parameters, although an increase in ecotoxicitywas observed (EC 50 reduced from 0. 31 % to 0. 21 %). The wastes from the kinetic study of persulphate and iodide reaction were treated with sodium bisulphite until colour was removed. Although they did not reveal significant ecotoxicity, only over 1 % of the untreated waste produced observable effects over algae. Therefore, ecotoxicity tests could be considered a useful tool not only in laboratory effluents treatment, as shown, but also in hazardous <b>wastewaters</b> <b>management...</b>|$|R
40|$|Around {{the world}} every day, {{large amounts of}} {{wastewater}} are treated before release, to avoid impacts on humans and the environment. The treatment requires resources {{in the form of}} energy and chemicals, and it generates large amounts of sewage sludge, however, it can also serve as a source of energy, nutrients and carbon. These valuable resources can be recovered in many ways, including in the form of biogas, or through the use of sludge in agriculture or even, potentially, in form of biopolymer raw material. Life cycle assessment (LCA) can be used to quantify the life cycle impact of <b>wastewater</b> and sludge <b>management</b> with resource recovery, on humans and the environment, in order to evaluate their environmental performance and avoid sub-optimisation. LCAs of such systems face different types of methodological problems. This thesis focusses on two such problems. The first research topic concerns how to divide the environmental impact that results from a wastewater treatment process with the simultaneous production of a valuable by-product. Methodologies exist for handling such general situations, however, some properties inherent to <b>wastewater</b> and sludge <b>management</b> may result in complex allocation problems. This research identified the LCA of a system with wastewater treatment and simultaneous polyhydroxyalcanoate (PHA) production as particularly challenging, if PHA was considered as the main product. Three partly new allocation approaches were evaluated, and the choice of approach was found to influence the LCA results. A second research topic concerns the potential importance of assessing the risks of the pathogens that exist in <b>wastewater</b> and sludge <b>management</b> systems, which is not currently done within the LCA framework. This research has found that these risks are potentially important compared to other impacts on human health, both for <b>wastewater</b> and sludge <b>management</b> systems where sludge is incinerated or used for agricultural purposes...|$|R
25|$|While Morocco {{is already}} a model of water {{management}} in the MENA region, upgrades to its water system under the National <b>Wastewater</b> <b>Management</b> Programme should further improve wastewater treatment and maximise efficient water usage. Authorities are promoting better water rationalisation in agriculture, which uses 80% of water resources, by replacing existing irrigation systems with micro- irrigation and drip networks. A net energy importer, Morocco launched the National Renewable Energy and Efficiency Plan in February 2008 to develop alternative energy to meet 15% of its domestic needs and increase the use of energy-saving methods. It is expected to create more than 40,000 jobs and stimulate over €4.5 billion in investment by 2020.

25|$|The {{government}} {{also wanted to}} include Autonomous Republic of Adjara in the service area of UWSCG in 2010. However, this was opposed by the German state-owned development bank KfW that provided substantial funding for {{water supply and sanitation}} in Batumi on behalf of the German government. Adjara was thus excluded. In 2014 the government made a second attempt to included Adjara in the service area of the United Water Company through a decree issued by the Prime Minister, but this attempt was also foiled. De jure water and <b>wastewater</b> <b>management</b> in Adjara remains decentralized, but actually the government in Tbilisi is involved in all important decisions so that de facto it is as centralized as in other regions of Georgia. On the one hand, the Batumi water company remains financially weak, with non-revenue water as high as 90%, significant amounts of unpaid bills. As a result, tariff revenues were only 0.7 million Laris (USD 0.4m) in 2014, while operating costs stood at 10 million Laris (USD 5.7m), of which 45% were for salaries, according to an audit by the state auditor. On the other hand, there have been many notable improvements in service quality in Batumi. For example, a separate stormwater drainage system has been built, preventing flooding that had previously been frequent. 70% of customers now receive water 24 hours a day, and a modern wastewater treatment plant has been commissioned in 2012. The plant functions properly, so that the quality of coastal waters has improved substantially, benefiting tourism and making it possible to eat again locally caught fish. Both the investments costs and the energy consumption of the trickling filter plant are extremely low, for which the Austrian engineering company working on the plant was honored with an innovation award by the International Water Association (IWA), a professional association.|$|E
