5|$|Conductive CVD diamond is {{a useful}} {{electrode}} under many circumstances. Photochemical methods {{have been developed for}} covalently linking DNA to the surface of polycrystalline diamond films produced through CVD. Such DNA modified films can be used for detecting various biomolecules, which would interact with DNA thereby changing electrical conductivity of the diamond film. In addition, diamonds can be used to detect redox reactions that cannot ordinarily be studied and in some cases degrade redox-reactive organic contaminants in water supplies. Because diamond is mechanically and chemically stable, it can be used as an electrode under conditions that would destroy traditional materials. As an electrode, synthetic diamond can be used in <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> <b>treatment</b> of organic effluents and the production of strong oxidants.|$|E

5|$|The {{municipality}} {{aims for}} a coherent and holistic {{administration of the}} water cycle to protect against or clean up previous pollution and encourage green growth and self-sufficiency. The main issues are excessive nutrients, adapting to increasing levels of precipitation brought on by climate change, and securing the water supply.

In the 2000s, underground rainwater basins were built across the city while the two lakes Årslev Engsø and Egå Engsø were created in 2003 and 2006 respectively.

Speed feed and Sugar graze), maize (Var. SC 704) and millet (Var.

Four varieties of forage plants with five levels of treated waste water: % 0, % 25, % 50, % 75 and % 100 were compared in a split-plot experiment based on Randomized Complete Block Design with four replications per treatment. Feeding values of forage plants such as Crude Protein content (CP), Neutral Detergent Fiber content (NDF), in vitro Dry Matter Digestibility (DMD), Organic Matter Digestibility (OMD) and D-Value were measured. Results showed that treated <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> irrigation had a significant effect on crude protein content. The highest crude protein content was shown at % 100 treated <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> (% 13. 76) and the lowest was shown at % treated <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> (% 9. 54).

The results of this work show that the optimal conditions for a photocatalytic purification unit remarkably depend on the kinetics of the pollutants degradation. In the case of fast degradation reactions low-power UV sources and low absorption catalysts are preferable. On the contrary the use of high-power lamps and dense catalysts can reduce sensibly the treatment cost when the degradation processes is slow...|$|R
