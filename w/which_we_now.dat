25|$|Postmodernity {{can mean}} a {{personal}} {{response to a}} postmodern society, the conditions in a society which make it postmodern or the state of being {{that is associated with}} a postmodern society as well an historical epoch. In most contexts it should be distinguished from postmodernism, the adoption of postmodern philosophies or traits in art, literature, culture and society. In fact, today, historical perspectives on the developments of postmodern art (postmodernism) and postmodern society (postmodernity) can be best described as two umbrella terms for processes engaged in an ongoing dialectical relationship, the result of which is the evolving world in <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>now</b> live.|$|E
25|$|It was {{traditionally}} thought (especially by the Aristotelians) {{that the}} air did not have lateral weight: that is, that the kilometers of air above the surface did not exert any weight on the bodies below it. Even Galileo had accepted the weightlessness of air as a simple truth. Torricelli questioned that assumption, and instead proposed that air had weight {{and that it was}} the latter (not the attracting force of the vacuum) which held (or rather, pushed) up the column of water. He thought that the level the water stayed at (c. 10.3m) was reflective of the force of the air's weight pushing on it (specifically, pushing on the water in the basin and thus limiting how much water can fall from the tube into it). In other words, he viewed the barometer as a balance, an instrument for measurement (as opposed to merely being an instrument to create a vacuum), and because {{he was the first to}} view it this way, he is traditionally considered the inventor of the barometer (in the sense in <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>now</b> use the term).|$|E

500|$|After stanza 18, a prose {{narrative}} relates that Helgi and his immense {{fleet of}} ships are heading to Frekastein, but encounter a great storm. Lightning strikes {{one of the}} ships. The fleet sees nine valkyries flying through the air, among whom they recognise Sigrún. The storm abates, and the fleets arrive safely at land. Helgi dies in battle, yet returns to visit Sigrún from Valhalla once in a burial mound, {{and at the end}} of the poem, a prose epilogue explains that Sigrún later dies of grief. The epilogue details that [...] "there was a belief in the pagan religion, <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>now</b> reckon [...] an old wives' tale, that people could be reincarnated" [...] and that [...] "Helgi and Sigrun were thought to have been reborn" [...] as another Helgi and valkyrie couple; Helgi as Helgi Haddingjaskaði and Sigrún as the daughter of Halfdan; the valkyrie Kára. The epilogue details that further information about the two can be found in the (now lost) work Káruljóð.|$|E
500|$|Pierre Rémond de Montmort, in {{collaboration}} with Nicolaus Bernoulli, wrote a book on probability Essay d'analyse sur les jeux de hazard which appeared in 1708, which {{can be seen as}} an extension of the Part III of Ars Conjectandi which applies combinatorics and probability to analyze games of chance commonly played at that time. Abraham de Moivre also wrote extensively on the subject in De mensura sortis: Seu de Probabilitate Eventuum in Ludis a Casu Fortuito Pendentibus of 1711 and its extension [...] The Doctrine of Chances or, a Method of Calculating the Probability of Events in Play of 1718. De Moivre's most notable achievement in probability was the discovery of the first instance of central limit theorem, by which he was able to approximate the binomial distribution with the normal distribution. To achieve this De Moivre developed an asymptotic sequence for the factorial function —- <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>now</b> refer to as Stirling's approximation —- and Bernoulli's formula for the sum of powers of numbers. Both Montmort and de Moivre adopted the term probability from Jacob Bernoulli, which had not been used in all the previous publications on gambling, and both their works were enormously popular.|$|E
