Of {{the richer}} modes of wall {{decoration}} {{it is impossible}} to institute any general comparison; they are quite infinite, from mere inlaid geometrical figures up to incrustations of elaborate bas-relief. The architect has perhaps more license in them, and more power of producing good effect with rude design than in any other features of the building; the chequer and hatchet work of the Normans and the rude bas-reliefs of the Lombards being almost as satisfactory as the delicate panelling and mosaic of the Duomo of Florence. But this is to be noted of all good <b>wall</b> <b>ornament,</b> that it retains the expression of firm and massive substance, and of broad surface, and that architecture instantly declined when linear design was substituted for massive, and the sense of weight of wall was lost in a wilderness of upright or undulating rods. Of the richest and most delicate wall veil decoration by inlaid work, as practised in Italy from the twelfth to the fifteenth century, I have given the reader two characteristic examples in Plates XX. and XXI.|$|E
60|$|In St. Michele of Lucca we have {{perhaps the}} noblest {{instance}} in Italy of the Lombard spirit in its later refinement. It is some four centuries later than St. Michele of Pavia, and {{the method of}} workmanship is altogether different. In the Pavian church, nearly all the ornament is cut in a coarse sandstone, in bold relief: a darker and harder stone (I think, not serpentine, but its surface is so disguised by the lustre of ages that I could not be certain) {{is used for the}} capitals of the western door, which are especially elaborate in their sculpture;--two devilish apes, or apish devils, I know not which, with bristly moustaches and edgy teeth, half-crouching, with their hands impertinently on their knees, ready for a spit or a spring if one goes near them; but all is pure bossy sculpture; there is no inlaying, except of some variegated tiles in the shape of saucers set concave (an ornament used also very gracefully in St. Jacopo of Bologna): and the whole surface of the church is enriched with the massy reliefs, well preserved everywhere above the reach of human animals, but utterly destroyed to some five or six feet from the ground; worn away into large cellular hollows and caverns, some almost deep enough to render the walls unsafe, entirely owing to the uses to which the recesses of the church are dedicated by the refined and high-minded Italians. But St. Michele of Lucca is wrought entirely in white marble and green serpentine; there is hardly any relieved sculpture except in the capitals of the shafts and cornices, and all the designs of <b>wall</b> <b>ornament</b> are inlaid with exquisite precision--white on dark ground; the ground being cut out and filled with serpentine, the figures left in solid marble. The designs of the Pavian church are encrusted on the walls; of the Lucchese, incorporated with them; small portions of real sculpture being introduced exactly where the eye, after its rest on the flatness of the wall, will take most delight in the piece of substantial form. The entire arrangement is perfect beyond all praise, and the morbid restlessness of the old designs is now appeased. Geometry seems to have acted as a febrifuge, for beautiful geometrical designs are introduced amidst the tumult of the hunt; and there is no more seeing double, nor ghastly monstrosity of conception; no more ending of everything in something else; no more disputing for spare legs among bewildered bodies; no more setting on of heads wrong side foremost. The fragments have come together: we are out of the Inferno with its weeping down the spine; we are in the fair hunting-fields of the Lucchese mountains (though they had their tears also),--with horse, and hound, and hawk; and merry blast of the trumpet.--Very strange creatures to be hunted, in all truth; but still creatures with a single head, and that on their shoulders, which is exactly the last place in the Pavian church where a head is to be looked for.|$|E

40|$|Microfilm is deadly. Deadly for the eyes, {{the brain}} and, as I {{recently}} learned {{here on a}} research jaunt to Beijing, the stomach. So when a CD booklet on the bar of a Haidian district livehouse caught my weary eye I thought I’d found a good <b>wall</b> <b>ornament</b> for the apartment and a better image to set my evenings eyes on. The only problem was the insert – a black 2 ̆ 6 white sketch of a mass of punks tossing Molotovs at a grinning Mao – wasn’t big enough. I was thinking poster size, so I {{took it to the}} first place that came to mind: my local Beijing Kinko’s. The attendant lifted the thing to her face and, yes, things got uncomfortable. There was no mistaking the message on the graphic’s palace backdrop to the Chairman: fanzui xiangfa, pohuai (criminals minds, destroy). And I felt a bit awkward walking in as an American with this suggestive graphic, so I made sure the staff took in the CD cover: two hands, a bloodied hatchet and the head of George W. Bush. These rockers were clearly out for everyone. The manager and attendant conferred in mutters while a third staffer busied himself with the printed album lyrics, half rendered in English. (E. g. “Kill your Television. We sit back passively as OUR culture is commoditized and force-fed back to us. We have nothing to talk about except TV’s imaginary lives that are safe and sanitized, while the real hours of our own lives are sold away as advertising space to corporations. Our lives become the commodity as the things we buy, the words we speak and the way we live all become reflections of what we watch. Smash your TV and live YOUR life!”; or “We destroy the red dream… The dream turned into a nightmare without end. Now it’s time to destroy this dream gone stale.

40|$|Presented work {{is devoted}} to {{analysis}} of heat exchange on external surfaces with a complex geometry. Thermal processes in a thin layer enclosing external wall are determined by both: surface parameters (surface temperature and it’s geometry) and weather conditions (external temperature, solar radiation and wind induced). Heat exchange on the external surface depends on air flow (natural or/and forced convection), temperature difference and heat flow density. The character and magnitude of physical processes is conditioned by heat flux and temperature on external surface. In this study, heat exchange processes on external surface were evaluated using numerical techniques. On the beginning, surface temperature as well as heat flux density were estimated for selected cases of heavy, homogeneous, masonry brick walls and glazing. Additionally, air flows around detailed <b>wall’s</b> <b>ornaments</b> were calculated using CFD techniques. The numerical study were empirically validated based on the infrared camera measurements...|$|R

50|$|Ottomans were {{developing}} urban cities very fast upon their conquest of B&H. Enriched by Islamic and Byzantine experiences they build {{so much that}} it can be compared only with medieval building in Dalmatian cities. For example, in Foča in 16th century Ottomans build 17 mosques, 29 public fountains, 6 public baths (hamam) and 13 caravanserai motels (han).Sarajevo {{is an example of a}} non-urban open city where the most important buildings are organized around one veining street - čaršija (Persian chahar-su meaning all four sides). In Sarajevo the largest is famous Baščaršija with shops of 50 different crafts from the 15th century. Also in Baščaršija is most impressive Gazi Husrev-beg’s mosque, also known as Beg’s mosque, built in 1531. Founded on Byzantine central square plan it has dome on large drum, two smaller domes leaning on both sides of drum and a semi-dome behind; in addition, above entrance is a porch with five tiny domes. Inside it is filled with rich <b>wall</b> <b>ornaments</b> in wood and Arabic calligraphic writings. The complex is complete with a high tower (munara) and fountain (šedrvan) in the courtyard.|$|R

The furniture, made after {{the designs of}} Dragutin Inkiostri, has been partially preserved and several pieces (e.g., a chair from the Minister's cabinet) {{are now in the}} Ethnographic Museum and the Museum of Applied Art in Belgrade. Most of the original compositions on the walls have been destroyed over time. However, the <b>wall</b> <b>ornaments</b> in the gateway towards the courtyard are original as they were accidentally painted over after the Second World War. They were discovered by accident in 1963, cleaned, and the allegoric compositions of religion, education, history and art can be seen on them. They were restored in 1997. Above the entrance to the building, the emblem of the Kingdom of Serbia was placed, embedded into the Art Nouveau shaped two-colored, red and white facade, with originally blended motifs from Serbian Medieval architecture, elements of Serbian national tradition, as well as the decorative motifs from the European secession. The purpose of this object, which is a testimony to the continuity of the culture of education, has been preserved for one hundred and thirty-five years.|$|R

40|$|Circular to subcircular {{drill holes}} were {{identified}} on the bivalve shells {{collected from the}} Seogwipo Formation, Jejudo, Korea. A {{great majority of the}} drill holes (> 70 %) were found on the surfaces of a bivalve species Glycymeris rotunda. They are characterized by a beveled sharp edge and paraboloid in cross section with larger outer borehole diameter (OBD; mean 4. 21  mm) and smaller inner borehole diameter (mean 2. 94  mm). Walls of the drill holes are generally smooth, and <b>walls</b> <b>ornamented</b> with etched relief-like structures were also recognized. A slightly raised central boss observed in an incomplete specimen may indicate a failure of predator’s attack. All drill holes collected are classified as a single ichnospecies Oichnus paraboloides Bromley, 1981. They are interpreted as boring traces produced by predatory gastropods, particularly naticid gastropods. Most O.  paraboloides boreholes are observed in the central area of shell surfaces; a few boreholes lie marginally, which may reflect a borehole-site selectivity. No correlation between size of prey (shell height) and size of predator (OBD) is recognized. It is likely, however, that drilled shells of about 30  mm in height represent optimal prey size for naticid predators that lived in a benthic Seogwipo community...|$|R
5000|$|The Grand Auditorium and Hotel Block is a {{group of}} four {{adjoining}} historic commercial buildings located in Story City, Iowa, United States. From the east, buildings one and three housed various commercial establishments over the years. Building two housed the Grand Opera House, now known as the Story Theatre/Grand Opera House. It has been used for both live theater productions and movies. The fourth building housed the Grand Hotel. The Grand Hotel and Auditorium Company was organized from Story City's Commercial Club in 1913. They hired Estherville, Iowa architect James S. Cox to design the complex, which was completed in December 1913. While each facade is unique, all four buildings share common elements. Their commonalities include two-stories in height, red brick exterior <b>walls</b> <b>ornamented</b> with buff brick and concrete details. The first three buildings share the same wall plane, while the hotel is slightly recessed from the others. They also decrease in scale from east to west. This slight variation is due to differing treatments of the cornices and parapets. [...] The buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.|$|R

There were remnants of faded and tattered paper-hangings, but larger spaces of bare <b>wall</b> <b>ornamented</b> with charcoal sketches, chiefly of people's heads in profile. These being specimens of Peter's youthful genius, it went more to his heart to obliterate them than if they had been pictures on a church wall by Michael Angelo. One sketch, however, and that the best one, affected him differently. It represented a ragged man, partly supporting himself on a spade, and bending his lean body over a hole in the earth, with one hand extended to grasp something that he had found. But close behind him, with a fiendish laugh on his features, appeared a figure with horns, a tufted tail, and a cloven hoof.|$|R
