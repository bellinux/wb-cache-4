5|$|One of the {{earliest}} Sooty bear puppets used by Harry Corbett is on display on the pier. Corbett bought the original Sooty puppet on North Pier for his son, Matthew. When Corbett took the puppet on BBC's Talent Night programme, he marked the nose and ears with soot so that they <b>would</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> on {{the black and white}} television, giving the puppet its name.|$|E
25|$|When Chen Tai was {{retreating}} back to Longxi Commandery, {{he predicted}} that Jiang Wei {{would attempt to}} make use of the mountainous terrain along the way to lay an ambush, so he took a southern detour back to Longxi Commandery. As he expected, Jiang Wei had indeed sent troops to lie in ambush for three days. However, the historian Pei Songzhi pointed out that it made no sense for Jiang Wei to set up the ambush because he did not know that Wei reinforcements <b>would</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> when he was besieging Didao so the ambush would not have served its purpose.|$|E
25|$|Confronted with riots {{threatening}} {{the lives of}} citizens and damaging their properties, the government took the decision to raise a special police force. On the morning of April 27, the authorities informed the population that men who <b>would</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> at 6:00pm {{in front of the}} dépôt de l'ordonnance on rue du Bord-de-l'Eau would receive arms. Some 800 men, principally Canadians from Montreal and its suburbs and some Irish immigrants of Griffintown, presented themselves and between 500 and 600 constables were armed and barracked near the Bonsecours Market. During the arms distribution, a group of men showed up and attacked the new constables by firing on them and throwing rocks at them. The newly armed men fought back and wounded three of their assailants.|$|E

25|$|In {{the pilot}} episode, {{and for the}} first season, Crockett pilots a Chris Craft Stinger 390 X - a 39-foot deep-v {{offshore}} racing boat. According to T. Rafael Cimino, marine director for Miami Vice, a total of five Stinger 390 Xs were used on the show. A white 390 X was selected for the pilot episode as it <b>would</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> better for the night scenes. For the other four Stingers, Chris-Craft showed the production crew a colour scheme that included the red - however, since Michael Mann decided that the colour red was to never show up on the show so a blue colour scheme was instead chosen. The Stingers used on the show were not free from Chris-Craft. In fact, the boats had some serious warranty issues. These issues caused the production team to switch to using Wellcraft 38 Scarab KVs {{for the remainder of the}} show. The Scarab 38 KVs were a 28-hued, twin 440-hp boat that sold for $130,000 in 1986.|$|E
25|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} 17 May 2004 and lasted six weeks. Arctor's house was located on Eric Circle in Southeast Austin. The previous tenants {{had left a}} month prior to filming and left the place {{in such a state}} that production designer Bruce Curtis had to make few modifications so that it looked like a run-down home. The filmmakers had looked at 60 houses before settling on this one. Linklater shot a lot of exteriors in Anaheim, California and then composited them into the Austin footage in post-production. Since the live action footage was to be animated over later, makeup, lighting and visible equipment, like boom mics, were less of a concern. However, cinematographer Shane Kelly carefully composed shots and used a color palette with the animators in mind. Sometimes, they <b>would</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> to tell Kelly what they needed. Because the movie was being shot digitally and then animated, occasionally actors forgot they would later be animated as they worked through a scene. Robert Downey, Jr. noted that he completely forgot the scene would later be animated as he worked through several takes in order to produce the smoke ring that would be featured in Barris' first closeup shot.|$|E
500|$|Series co-star Robert Patrick had issues remembering and {{delivering}} his lines {{due to the}} theme of demonic possession, which reportedly [...] "was freaking" [...] him out. He later explained, [...] "It {{was the first time that}} I couldn't do my lines. Usually I <b>would</b> <b>show</b> <b>up,</b> and they'd always put the camera on me first [...] I couldn't do it." ...|$|E

50|$|In Detroit, Michigan {{during the}} 1970s, Incardona frequented the Capital Cue Club when games of stake were plentiful. He <b>would</b> often <b>show</b> <b>up</b> at pool tournaments and match up brilliantly, taking home the cash.|$|R

500|$|Although {{the number}} of visiting eagles fluctuated, about 200 to 300 eagles <b>would</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> each day during the months of winter and early spring. [...] Crows and gulls were also {{attracted}} to the area. Keene fed them an estimated 500 pounds (227kg) of fish per day, about 50,000 pounds (22,680kg) per year. Her fish supply included surplus and freezer-burned fish from fish processing facilities still on the Spit, her own purchases using her limited funds from Social Security or retirement benefits, or fish contributed by her supporters. Visitors could come and watch the eagles Keene fed on the Spit at no cost, but were asked {{to stay in their}} cars for their own safety and {{for the safety of the}} eagles.|$|E
500|$|In January 1971, {{upon their}} return from touring Atom Heart Mother, Pink Floyd {{began working on}} new material.

The band spent long periods working on basic sounds, or a guitar riff. They also spent several days at Air Studios, attempting to create music using a variety of household objects, a project which would be revisited between The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here.|$|E
500|$|Fear of Scientology's {{litigiousness}} rendered American networks {{unwilling to}} license any {{material to the}} filmmakers, which Gibney found [...] "astounding". He commented that he [...] "found it interesting that universally this subject — {{more than any other}} — provoked all the networks to decline to license. I {{think at the end of}} the day, that tells you more about Scientology than it does about the networks, which is how ruthless they've been in trying to silence any criticism." [...] The church's reputation for harassing its critics made it necessary for Gibney to use burner phones to contact interviewees and film in secret: [...] "Sometimes for the on-camera interviews we'd set up gear in somebody's house and I'd make sure I'd be there hours before. Then the person <b>would</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> there so it was like they were just going to somebody’s house." ...|$|E
50|$|Stephanie <b>would</b> also <b>show</b> <b>up</b> {{against her}} mentor's nemesis, the Calculator, with his daughter, Wendy Harris, to rescue Barbara and Gotham itself after the villain injects nanites into the {{citizens}} and {{heroes of the}} city and controls them.|$|R

50|$|Jakob Jensen was {{a strong}} {{opponent}} of public intoxication and workers spending their salaries in the nightlife instead of their families.

500|$|Both {{the opening}} and {{the ending of the}} film were {{reworked}} in various ways. First it would begin with a flashback to Tony's childhood. Then like Iron Man it would begin in medias res, with Tony crashing in Tennessee before a voiceover that would lead to how he got there, until it got changed to the final version. For the climactic tanker battle, it was originally considered that Brandt <b>would</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> in the James Bond tradition of the henchman coming back for the heroes. Instead they chose to use Killian himself, and have Pepper, whom he abused earlier, cause his downfall as a way of poetic justice. The final dialogue was originally written as [...] "I am Tony Stark" [...] to be a response to the first film's ending, but eventually it changed to [...] "I am Iron Man" [...] to enhance the mythical qualities.|$|E
500|$|Leckie {{had worked}} on albums such as George Harrison's All Things Must Pass and Ringo Starr's Sentimental Journey, and was {{employed}} as a tape-operator on Meddle, partly for his proclivity for working into {{the early hours of}} the morning. [...] He has said that Pink Floyd's sessions would often begin in the afternoon, and end early the next morning, [...] "during which time nothing would get done. There was no record company contact whatsoever, except when their label manager <b>would</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> now and again with a couple of bottles of wine and a couple of joints." [...] The band would apparently spend long periods of time working on simple sounds, or a particular guitar riff. [...] They also spent several days at AIR attempting to create music using a variety of household objects, a project which would be revisited between their next albums, The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here.|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions were}} difficult for lead singer Michael Stipe, who, among the band, was particularly worn {{out by the}} band's 1983 tour schedule. Getting usable vocal tracks from Stipe was difficult; Dixon recalled that he and Stipe <b>would</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> around noon each day {{before the rest of}} the band, but that [...] "he was kind of shut down, and it was difficult to get him to open up". While recording the song [...] "7 Chinese Brothers", Stipe sang so quietly that Dixon could not hear him on the tape. Frustrated, the producer climbed a ladder to a spot above the recording booth Stipe was in and found a gospel record titled The Joy of Knowing Jesus by the Revelaires, which he then handed to the singer in an attempt to inspire him. Stipe began reciting the liner notes from the album audibly, which enabled Dixon to move on to recording the vocal track to [...] "7 Chinese Brothers" [...] properly (the initial recitation take was later released in 1987 as [...] "Voice of Harold" [...] on the compilation Dead Letter Office).|$|E
5000|$|In the mid-2000s, the Secret Six {{made their}} {{headquarters}} in the House of Secrets.

5000|$|The {{original}} {{concept for}} Katahdin was considerably more terrifying than what <b>would</b> eventually <b>show</b> <b>up</b> on screen.

Interestingly, the original concept was actually quite close to the poster art.|$|R

500|$|Bart Simpson {{is one of}} Krusty's biggest fans. In {{the episode}} [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] (Season 1, Episode 12) he {{declared}} [...] "I've based my entire life on Krusty's teachings" [...] and sleeps in a room filled with Krusty merchandise. He exposed Sideshow Bob's attempted framing, helped Krusty return to {{the air with a}} comeback special and reignite his career and reunited Krusty with his estranged father. For his part, Krusty is usually grateful for Bart's assistance, but will almost immediately forget about it, presumably due to his excessive drinking and drug habits, and usually does not even remember his name the next time they encounter each other. One summer, Bart enthusiastically attended Kamp Krusty, largely because of the promise that he would get to spend his summer with Krusty. The camp {{turned out to be a}} disaster, with Krusty nowhere to be seen, as the camp was simply a franchise location that Krusty had licensed his image to. Bart kept his hopes up by believing that Krusty <b>would</b> <b>show</b> <b>up,</b> but one day the camp director, Mr. Black, brought in Barney Gumble with clown makeup masquerading as Krusty. This pushed Bart over the edge. He decided that he was sick of Krusty's shoddy merchandise and took over the camp. Krusty immediately visited the camp in hopes of ending the conflict and managed to appease Bart.|$|E
500|$|Stone gave Charlie Sheen {{the choice}} of Jack Lemmon or Martin Sheen to play his father in the film, and Sheen picked his father. The elder Sheen related to the moral sense of his character. Stone cast Daryl Hannah as Bud Fox's materialistic girlfriend Darien Taylor, but {{felt that she was}} never happy with the role and did not know why she {{accepted}} it. He tried to explain the character to Hannah repeatedly, and thought that the materialism of the character conflicted with Hannah's idealism. Stone said later that he was aware early on that she was not right for the part. [...] "Daryl Hannah was not happy doing the role and I should have let her go. All my crew {{wanted to get rid of}} her after one day of shooting. My pride was such that I kept saying I was going to make it work". Stone also had difficulties with Sean Young, who made her opinions known that Hannah should be fired and that she should play that role instead. Young <b>would</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> to the set late and unprepared. She did not get along with Charlie Sheen, which caused further friction on the set. In retrospect, Stone felt that Young was right and he should have swapped Hannah's role with hers. Stone admits that he had [...] "some problems" [...] with Young, but was not willing to confirm or deny rumors that she walked off with all of her costumes when she completed filming.|$|E
500|$|Hendrix {{was not as}} {{confident}} {{a singer}} as he was a guitarist, and because he strongly disliked anyone watching him sing he asked the engineers at Olympic to construct a privacy barrier {{between him and the}} control room. This created problems when the studio lights were low, and the engineers were unable to see him, making his visual cues and prompts difficult to communicate. As was the case at De Lane Lea, Hendrix's penchant for using multiple amplifiers at extreme volume drew criticism and complaints from the people living and working near to the studio. Olympic tape operator George Chkiantz recalled: [...] "Sometimes, it got so loud we'd turn the [...] monitors off and there was really very little difference." [...] Chkiantz noted that reactions to Hendrix's music were not always positive: [...] "I seem to recall a lot of musicians, a lot of people, saying, 'I can't see what all the fuss is about myself', or 'I don't know how you listen to all that noise; I'd be scared to work with him'... Chas was convinced that he was on to something. Not everyone was convinced that Chas was right." [...] Another issue that complicated the sessions were the large number of female fans who <b>would</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> at the studio wanting to watch the Experience record. As a habit, Hendrix would indiscriminately tell people where they would be on any given day, which led to large groups of fans following him everywhere. Olympic employees were tasked with keeping them under control and at a safe distance so as to not unduly burden the recording process. Chkiantz commented: [...] "It was extraordinary. I worked with the Stones. I worked with the Beatles. I worked with Led Zeppelin. I was not as jumpy; it was not as difficult as with Hendrix. It was something of an open house. Hendrix was not difficult at all, but I personally would have preferred not to have loads of girls lurking in the woodwork." ...|$|E
50|$|Blassie {{claims that}} he made Regis Philbin into the celebrity he is today. When Philbin had a late-night weekend talk show in San Diego, Blassie <b>would</b> {{routinely}} <b>show</b> <b>up</b> to yell at the audience, throw furniture, and threaten Philbin. In later years, Blassie also appeared on The Mike Douglas Show when Philbin was a guest host.|$|R
50|$|Mike {{was known}} for his clothing, which {{included}} a red Calgary Flames hat, a checkered shirt, and brown vest. He also owned a dog, named Norm, that was actually only a stuffed animal which he would attempt to have perform tricks. Mike <b>would</b> often <b>show</b> <b>up</b> at the most unexpected of times in various random skits in Air Farce.|$|R
5000|$|Parker, Coburn {{and others}} in the cast were working on other {{projects}} during the making of the film and <b>would</b> repeatedly <b>show</b> <b>up</b> {{in the nick of time}} and do their lines without makeup and little or no rehearsal. (Coburn also appeared with McQueen in The Magnificent Seven and another World War II film, The Great Escape.) ...|$|R
500|$|Bart {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} fans of children's {{television}} host Krusty the Clown. He once declared, [...] "I've based my whole life on Krusty's teachings," [...] and sleeps in a room filled with Krusty merchandise. He has helped the clown on many occasions, for example, foiling Sideshow Bob's attempt to frame Krusty for armed robbery in [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] (season one, 1990), reuniting Krusty with his estranged father in [...] "Like Father, Like Clown". and helping Krusty return to the air with a comeback special and reignite his career in [...] "Krusty Gets Kancelled". For his part, Krusty has remained largely ignorant of Bart's help and treats Bart with disinterest. One summer, Bart enthusiastically attended Kamp Krusty, which turned out to be a disaster, with Krusty nowhere to be seen. Bart keeps his hopes up by believing that Krusty <b>would</b> <b>show</b> <b>up,</b> but is soon pushed over the edge, and finally decides that he is sick of Krusty's shoddy merchandise and takes over the camp. Krusty immediately visits the camp in hopes of ending the conflict and manages to appease Bart. One of the original ideas for the series was that Bart worshiped a television clown but had no respect for his father, although this was never directly explored. Because of this original plan, Krusty's design is basically Homer in clown make-up. When Bart foiled Sideshow Bob's plans in [...] "Krusty Gets Busted", it sparked a long-standing feud between the two. The writers decided to have Bob repeatedly return to get revenge on Bart. They took the idea of the Coyote chasing the Road Runner and depicted Bob as an intelligent person obsessed with catching a bratty boy. Bob has appeared in fourteen episodes, generally plotting various evil schemes which often have to do with getting revenge on Bart (and sometimes the entire Simpson family by proxy), but is always foiled in the end.|$|E
2500|$|Johnson {{lived in}} Houston {{for four years}} after his arrest for flag desecration, during which he worked in a {{warehouse}} while his attorneys worked on his case. He was described by a contemporaneous Houston activist, Geov Parrish, as an [...] "obnoxious young transplanted New Yorker" [...] who <b>would</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> at [...] "every local demonstration with a bloody, severed pig's head (tendrils still trailing along) that he'd drag along on a leash and collar while shouting anti-imperialist slogans; the pig, of course, was the United States." ...|$|E
2500|$|On several occasions, Moe was {{convinced}} that rising star Lou Costello (a close friend of Shemp) was stealing material from Curly. Costello was known to acquire prints of the Stooges' films from Columbia Pictures on occasion, presumably to study Curly. Inevitably, Curly's routines <b>would</b> <b>show</b> <b>up</b> in Abbott and Costello feature films, much to Moe's chagrin. (It did not help that Columbia Pictures president Harry Cohn would not allow the Stooges to make feature-length films like contemporaries Laurel and Hardy, the Marx Brothers, and Abbott and Costello.) ...|$|E
5000|$|It was {{not always}} the A-side of a {{released}} single that <b>would</b> eventually <b>show</b> <b>up</b> on Svensktoppen. Sometimes also the B-side or even a non-single track managed to crack the top 10. For clarification, the song that eventually did <b>show</b> <b>up</b> on Svensktoppen {{can be found in}} the [...] "Svensktoppen entry" [...] column, with additional info about its date of entry, the highest position and the number of weeks the song stayed on the charts.|$|R
50|$|Felipe González became Prime Minister (Presidente del Gobierno in Spanish) after PSOE's {{victory in}} the elections. PSOE at that time, though it had renounced its Marxist ideology, still had a populist current, led by Alfonso Guerra, {{as opposed to a}} neo-liberal one, led by Miguel Boyer. This would cause {{divisions}} in the party which <b>would</b> not <b>show</b> <b>up</b> until years later.|$|R
50|$|In 1947, Carroll {{returned}} to the U.S. together with Lavorel. Their intention was for her to resume her acting career, which would fund their production company, but they soon separated.
