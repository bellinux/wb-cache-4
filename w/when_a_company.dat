Starting November 2, 1983, Greyhound suffered a major and bitter drivers' strike with one fatality in Zanesville, Ohio, <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>company</b> bus ran over a worker at a picket line. A new contract was ratified December 19, and drivers returned to work the next day.|$|E
5|$|Enron {{capitalized}} the Raptors, and, in {{a manner}} similar to the accounting employed <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>company</b> issues stock at a public offering, then booked the notes payable issued as assets on its balance sheet while increasing the shareholders' equity for the same amount. This treatment later became an issue for Enron and its auditor Arthur Andersen as removing it from the balance sheet resulted in a $1.2 billion decrease in net shareholders' equity.|$|E

50|$|From a {{risk profile}} perspective, {{dividends}} are unique. <b>When</b> <b>a</b> <b>company's</b> profit improve, dividends usually rise; when they fall dividends are cut.

5|$|Since {{its initial}} {{resolution}} of July 1960, the UN had issued further resolutions {{calling for the}} total withdrawal of Belgian and mercenary forces from Katanga in progressively stronger terms. By 1961, ONUC comprised nearly 20,000 men. Although their mandate prevented them from taking sides, ONUC had a mandate to arrest foreign mercenaries wherever they encountered them. In September 1961, an attempt to detain a group of Katangese mercenaries without violence during Operation Morthor went wrong {{and turned into a}} fire-fight. ONUC's claim to impartiality was undermined in mid-September <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>company</b> of Irish UN troops were captured by numerically superior Katangese forces following a six-day siege in Jadotville. Katanga proceeded to hold the Irishmen as prisoners of war, a development that deeply embarrassed the UN mission and its proponents.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Gang Toi (8 November 1965) {{was fought}} during the Vietnam War between Australian {{troops and the}} Viet Cong. The battle {{was one of the}} first engagements between the two forces during the war and {{occurred}} <b>when</b> <b>A</b> <b>Company,</b> 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (1 RAR) struck a Viet Cong bunker system defended by Company 238 in the Gang Toi Hills, in northern Bien Hoa Province. It occurred during a major joint US-Australian operation codenamed Operation Hump, involving the US 173rd Airborne Brigade, to which 1 RAR was attached. During the latter part of the operation an Australian rifle company clashed with an entrenched company-sized Viet Cong force in well-prepared defensive positions. Meanwhile, an American paratroop battalion was also heavily engaged in fighting on the other side of the Song Dong Nai.|$|E

5000|$|In <b>a</b> {{special case}} <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>company's</b> {{return on equity}} is equal to its risk {{adjusted}} discount rate, SPM {{is equivalent to the}} Gordon growth model (GGM). However because GGM only considers the present value of dividend payments, GGM cannot be used to value a business which does not pay dividends. Also, <b>when</b> <b>a</b> firm's return on equity is not equal to the discount rate, GGM becomes highly sensitive to input value changes. Alternatively, SPM values dividends and retained earnings separately, taking into consideration the present value of the future income generated by retained earnings, and then summing this result with the present value of expected dividends held constant in perpetuity. Consequently, SPM can be used to value <b>a</b> growing <b>company</b> regardless of dividend policy. SPM is also much less sensitive to input value changes <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>company’s</b> return on equity is different from the discount rate. An empirical test [...] shows that SPM is substantially more accurate in estimating observed stock market prices than the Gordon Growth Model.|$|R
50|$|Companies {{can also}} choose to rebrand to remain {{relevant}} to its (new) customers and stakeholders. This could occur <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>company's</b> business has changed, for example its strategic direction and industry focus, or its brand no longer fits its (new) customer base. For example, <b>a</b> <b>company</b> might rebrand {{so that its}} name works in new market it enters, for reasons of culture or language, such as {{to make it easier}} to pronounce.|$|R
25|$|Often {{business}} transfers take place <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>company</b> has plunged into an insolvency procedure.

25|$|The sling is {{mentioned}} by Homer and by other Greek authors. Xenophon in {{his history of}} the retreat of the Ten Thousand, 401 BC, relates that the Greeks suffered severely from the slingers in the army of Artaxerxes II of Persia, while they themselves had neither cavalry nor slingers, and were unable to reach the enemy with their arrows and javelins. This deficiency was rectified <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>company</b> of 200 Rhodians, who understood the use of leaden sling-bullets, was formed.

25|$|In Europe {{there exists}} a type of asset-backed bond called a covered bond, {{commonly}} known by the German term Pfandbriefe. Covered bonds were first created in 19th-century Germany when Frankfurter Hypo began issuing mortgage covered bonds. The market has been regulated since {{the creation of a}} law governing the securities in Germany in 1900. The key difference between covered bonds and mortgage-backed or asset-backed securities is that banks that make loans and package them into covered bonds keep those loans on their books. This means that <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>company</b> with mortgage assets on its books issues the covered bond, its balance sheet grows, which would not occur if it issued an MBS, although it may still guarantee the securities payments.|$|E
25|$|A {{different}} {{study showed}} that higher levels of media exposure are associated with lower reputations for companies, even when the mere exposure is mostly positive. A subsequent review of the research concluded that exposure leads to ambivalence because it brings about {{a large number of}} associations, which tend to be both favorable and unfavorable. Exposure is most likely to be helpful <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>company</b> or product is new and unfamiliar to consumers. An 'optimal' level of exposure to an advertisement may or may not exist. In a third study, experimenters primed consumers with affective motives. One group of thirsty consumers were primed with a happy face before being offered a beverage, while a second group was primed with an unpleasant face. The group primed with the happy face bought more beverages, and were also willing to pay more for the beverage than their unhappy counterparts. This study bolsters Zajonc's claim that choices are not in need of cognition. Buyers often choose what they 'like' instead of what they have substantially cognized.|$|E
25|$|The {{units of}} the 1st Arkansas were to proceed to Ft. Roots outside of Little Rock for {{mobilization}} when the companies had reached the minimum company strength of sixty-five men. The minimum strength was difficult to achieve because of new orders from the War Department mustering out guardsmen with families and those with previous orders. This released all men employed in government work. To counteract the men mustered out, companies were held at their home stations {{as long as possible}} to stimulate recruiting. It was known by guard officers that <b>when</b> <b>a</b> <b>company</b> leaves its home station the boys of the community lose interest in joining the guard the fear {{that they will not be}} assigned to their local company. Recruiting for the guard was greatly aided when Armour, one of the largest companies in Little Rock, gave the difference between salaries to its regular employees who had enlisted in the Arkansas National Guard before March 31, 1917, and were called into active service. Individuals also were exemplifying patriotism; one man upon learning the need of men for the guards left his work in the fields and walked thirty miles to enlist.|$|E
