40|$|Heat {{transport}} during short-circuit-Gas Metal Arc Welding is {{investigated by}} means of a calorimetric method. The influence of some important welding parameters on the heat flow to the <b>welding</b> <b>plate</b> is determined. The signal of current and voltage during the calorimetric experiments is used to calculate the heat transport to the <b>welding</b> <b>plate.</b> This calculation is done {{with the help of a}} computer program which analyses the measured signals of current and voltage. In this calculation is taken into account both the heat transport to the electrode and the heat transport to the weld pool. Also is looked for the influence of the welding parameters on some efficiencies. The stability of the process is strongly depending on the transport of the electrode material. Electrode melting plays an important role in the transport of the electrode material and therefore heat transport is important for the stability of the process. The results from the calorimetric experiments show that the heat transport to the <b>welding</b> <b>plate</b> is at most with maximum stability.

40|$|Heat {{production}} of {{friction stir welding}} (FSW) is afundamental phenomenon that affects the welding quality. Early studies havebeen focused on investigating and understanding the heat production andtemperature distribution of the <b>welding</b> <b>plate.</b> However, very few studies havebeen done to analyze {{the stress of the}} welding pin with reference to heat-forcecoupling, which is of great significance for the welding pin design. Therefore,this paper sets out to analyze the heat-force coupling effect of the weldingpin. Firstly, considering the variation of heat conduction coefficient atdifferent temperatures, the temperature distribution of both aluminum alloy 2 A 12 and copper plate were calculated for the FSW process. The temperaturedistribution results are then used to analyze the heat-force coupling of FSWpin referring to the cross force and axial pressure on the welding pin. Thecross force and axial pressure are determined by the softened base metal whichhas different mechanical properties at different temperatures. The results showthat the peak value of stress is at the boundary between the shoulder and pin. The pin is liable to break at peak stress, and hence more attention should bepaid to welding tool design...|$|E

Original {{position}} statistic distribution analysis (OPA) {{technique is}} {{a new kind of}} analysis method {{that can be used to}} detect the segregation, porosity and non-metal inclusion of iron and steel material. In the present paper, the technique has been applied to analyze two middle and low alloy <b>welding</b> <b>plate</b> samples. One sample is normal and there is no any defect in its welding seam, whereas the other sample has one obvious little defect in its welding seam. For each sample, both the welding seam and the mother material were scanned and analyzed, and the continuous content distribution of each element in scan area was thus accurately obtained. From the content distribution map, the weld shape and the transition zone were directly observed. By using the content curve from mother material to the welding seam, the content change range and its change gradient were calculated. These two parameters were suggested to evaluate the quality of the welding seam and the welding technology. For the sample with the little defect, in its defect region the contents of C and S presented higher, whereas the contents of metal elements such as Ni, Cr, Mn, Mo, Al presented lower. This result gave the reason why its mechanics property was relatively bad. It was suggested that the defect completely resulted from another kind of material. ...|$|E

A working welding model was created using a commercial finite element software package with the capabilities to model welding processes. The welding model was systematically developed from a two-dimensional model into a threedimensional full physics process model.
