5|$|After {{years of}} decline with {{abandoned}} buildings and high elderly populations, {{the demographics of}} Old Louisville began to change noticeably in the 1990s. New residents were not just college students using the area as housing, but also young professionals who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> Old Louisville. The Courier-Journal's Velocity weekly has reported the area as a hip, emerging center of culture in Louisville. This change is reflected in numerous coffeehouses, restaurants and bars opening in Old Louisville in the 1990s and early 2000s targeting at the younger crowd.|$|E
5|$|Hippopotamuses {{have been}} the {{subjects}} of various African folktales. According to a San story; when the Creator assigned each animal its place in nature, the hippos <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> the water, but were refused {{out of fear that}} they might eat all the fish. After begging and pleading, the hippos were finally allowed to live in the water on the conditions that they would eat grass instead of fish and would fling their dung {{so that it can be}} inspected for fish bones. In a Ndebele tale, the hippo originally had long, beautiful hair, but was set on fire by a jealous hare and had to jump into a nearby pool. The hippo lost most of his hair and was too embarrassed to leave the water.|$|E
5|$|After {{turning down}} {{potential}} transfers to West Ham and Torquay, because {{neither he nor}} his wife <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> either place, Irvine decided to sign for Third Division outfit Halifax Town in December 1972. Despite taking a considerable pay cut, he chose Halifax to enable his family to return to live near Burnley. Irvine made a total of 11 first-team appearances for Halifax Town, scoring one goal for the club. He played his last competitive game for the club in the 1–0 win against York City on 13 March 1973, after manager George Mulhall accused Irvine of not trying and not deserving his wage. At the end of the 1972–73 season, the team avoided relegation to the Fourth Division on goal difference. After failing to report for the away game at Walsall on 1May 1973, to play in a testimonial match for Burnley defender John Angus, he was fined two weeks' wages and forced into extra training sessions. In the summer of 1973, Irvine left Halifax Town by mutual consent, his professional football career over at the age of 29. Despite having the option to sign for Rochdale, he joined semi-professional side Great Harwood, who played in the Northern Premier League. At Great Harwood, he played alongside two former Burnley teammates; goalkeeper Adam Blacklaw and midfielder Les Latcham. Irvine remained at the club for a number of months, before leaving midway through the 1973–74 season and retiring from football altogether.|$|E

25|$|As Saratoga Springs {{began to}} develop {{into one of the}} country's most fashionable resorts in the late 19th century, it {{developed}} its own upper and upper-middle class. These people, primarily the owners of stores and spas and those who owned the firms that designed and built them, <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> houses that reflected their success. They gravitated to the neighborhoods east of upper Broadway and north of Union Avenue, where the wealthy summer residents had their homes. Their own homes were scaled-down versions of those homes, often by the same architects, including R. Newton Brezee, who himself lived on the East Side.|$|E
25|$|Fulgencio Batista {{had already}} been Cuban President once, from 1940 to 1944. Following his divorce from his first wife in October 1945, he married Marta Fernández Miranda on November 28th,1945. The couple moved to the United States during the 1940s after Batista's choice for his {{successor}} lost the presidential election in 1944. They had originally <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> Palm Beach, Florida, but were shunned by the Palm Beach community. They rented a car and began driving north on U.S. Route 1 along the Florida coast. After arriving in Daytona Beach {{at the end of}} the day, they liked the reception they received there. They hired a real estate agent the next day and purchased a large riverfront house, where they lived on and off while continuing to influence Cuban politics.|$|E
25|$|Unger's {{critique}} of economics {{begins with the}} identification of a key moment in economic history, when the analysis of production and exchange turned away from social theory and engaged in a quest for scientific objectivity. In Unger’s analysis, classical economics focused on the causal relations among social activities, which were connected with the production and distribution of wealth. Classical economists asked questions about the true basis of value, activities that contributed to national wealth, systems of rights, or about the forms of government under which people grow rich. In the late-nineteenth century, in response to attacks from socialist ideas and debates about how society works, and {{as a means to}} escape the conundrums of value theory and to answer how values could become prices, marginalist economics arose. This movement in economics disengaged economics from prescriptive and normative commitments to withdraw the study of economies from debates about how society worked and what kind of society we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in.</b> For Unger, this moment in the history of economics robbed it of any analytical or practical value.|$|E

500|$|The Chrysler Building {{also appears}} in many photo shoots. In December 1929, Walter Chrysler hired the {{photographer}} Margaret Bourke-White {{to take pictures}} of the building for publicity purposes. She took the images from a scaffold [...] meters high and worked at a studio at ground level until she was evicted in 1934. According to one account, Bourke-White <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> the building {{for the duration of the}} photo shoot, but the only person who could actually live in the building was the janitor, so she was relegated to co-leasing a studio instead with Time Inc. In 1930, several of her photographs were used in a special report on skyscrapers in the then-new Fortune magazine. In 1934, Bourke-White's partner Oscar Graubner took a famous photo called [...] "Margaret Bourke-White atop the Chrysler Building", which depicts her taking a photo of the city's skyline while sitting on the 61st-floor eagle ornaments. On October 5, 1998, Christie's auctioned the photograph for $96,000. In addition, during a January 1931 dance organized by the Society of Beaux-Arts, six architects, including Van Alen, were photographed while wearing costumes resembling the buildings that each architect designed.|$|E
