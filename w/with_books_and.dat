5|$|Japan's first {{experience}} <b>with</b> <b>books</b> <b>and</b> written language came from books written in Classical Chinese in China, brought to Japan from the Korean kingdoms, {{at least by}} the 5th and probably {{by the end of}} the 4th century. According to legend, the scholar Wani came to Japan in 406 and brought with him the Confucian Analects and Thousand Character Classic. These were followed, in later years, by the Five Classics (Book of Odes, Book of History, Book of Rites, Book of Changes and the Spring and Autumn Annals), which, by the 6th century, became well-known among the Japanese literary elite. The Seventeen-article constitution, compiled in 604 by Prince Shōtoku, has quotations that allow the identification of 18 Chinese books known to have existed in Japan at the time: Odes, Rites, Classic of Filial Piety, Analects, Chronicle of Zuo, the Han Chronicles (Book of Han and Book of the Later Han), Wen Xuan anthology, Zhuangzi and other classical Chinese writings.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, the University of Chicago, {{fearful that}} its vast {{resources}} would injure smaller schools by drawing away good students, affiliated with several regional colleges and universities: Des Moines College, Kalamazoo College, Butler University, and Stetson University. In 1896, the university affiliated with Shimer College in Mount Carroll, Illinois. Under {{the terms of}} the affiliation, the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university, to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals, to make no faculty appointment without the university's approval, and to send copies of examinations for suggestions. The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago. A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago, and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work. The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools <b>with</b> <b>books</b> <b>and</b> scientific apparatus and supplies at cost; special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses; and a copy of every book and journal published by the University of Chicago Press at no cost. The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice. Several University of Chicago professors disliked the program, as it involved uncompensated additional labor on their part, and they believed it cheapened the academic reputation of the university. The program passed into history by 1910.|$|E

25|$|Around February 1860 liberal theologians {{entered the}} fray, when seven {{produced}} a manifesto titled Essays and Reviews. These Anglicans included Oxford professors, country clergymen, {{the headmaster of}} Rugby school and a layman. Their declaration that miracles were irrational stirred up unprecedented anger, drawing much of the fire away from Darwin. Essays sold 22,000 copies in two years, more than the Origin sold in twenty years, and sparked five years of increasingly polarised debate <b>with</b> <b>books</b> <b>and</b> pamphlets furiously contesting the issues.|$|E

25|$|Concerned {{that the}} sale of items such as bongs and rolling papers, along <b>with</b> <b>books</b> <b>and</b> {{magazines}} devoted to the era's drug culture promoted and encouraged illegal recreational drug use, {{the board of trustees}} of the village of Hoffman Estates, Illinois, passed an ordinance requiring that vendors of drug paraphernalia obtain a license to do so, as they lacked the power to ban their sale outright. As a condition of that license, they were required to keep a record of the name and address of anyone buying such items for inspection by the police at any time. One of the two stores it applied to, The Flipside, filed suit in federal court for the Northern District of Illinois, seeking to have the ordinance invalidated, claiming its scope was so wide and overbroad as to possibly prevent the store from selling the books and magazines, thus infringing its First Amendment rights.|$|E

500|$|With {{the onset}} of the Great Depression in 1929, the Experimental College began a slow decline. Many {{students}} couldn't afford tuition, fewer had additional savings, and several dropped out. Along <b>with</b> <b>books</b> <b>and</b> campus salaries, the Experimental College became a budgetary luxury during a time of economic need for both students and the state, and its funding was in jeopardy. Meiklejohn started an Experimental College interest-fee loan fund for unfunded students, and asked advisers and monied students to donate. During this period, some sophomores absconded the college for two weeks to live like the vagrant hobos who traveled the Midwest by rail looking for work. They returned to write papers about their experiences, which Meiklejohn is said to have appreciated for its syncretism of experience and the great questions grounded in their readings.|$|E
500|$|The Gregorian {{mission was}} a group of Italian monks and priests sent by Pope Gregory the Great to Britain in the late 6th and early 7th centuries to convert and Christianize the Anglo-Saxons from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism. The first group {{consisted}} of about 40 monks and priests, some of whom had been monks in Gregory's own monastery in Rome. After a long trip, during which they almost gave up and returned to Rome, they arrived in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Kent in 597. [...] Gregory sent a second group of missionaries in 601 as reinforcements, along <b>with</b> <b>books</b> <b>and</b> relics for the newly founded churches. From Kent, the missionaries spread to the East Anglian kingdom and to the north of Britain, but after King Æthelberht of Kent's death, the mission was mostly confined to Kent. Another mission was sent to the kingdom of Northumbria when Æthelberht's daughter married King Edwin of Northumbria around 625. After Edwin's death in 633, a pagan backlash against Christianization occurred, and the mission was again confined to Kent; most of the missionaries fled Northumbria because they feared the pagans who returned to power after Edwin's death.|$|E

2500|$|The Swedish {{occupation}} of Olomouc from 1642 to 1650 led to total ruination of the library.

2500|$|A polymath, Fox {{included}} numerous real-world historical, scientific, and mythological {{references in}} his comic strips, once saying, [...] "Knowledge {{is kind of}} a hobby with me". For instance, during a year's worth of Atom comic strip stories, Fox referred to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, the space race, 18th-century England, miniature card painting, Norse mythology, and numismatics. He revealed in letters to fan Jerry Bails that he kept large troves of reference material, mentioning during 1971, [...] "I maintain two file cabinets chock full of stuff. And the attic is crammed <b>with</b> <b>books</b> <b>and</b> magazines....Everything about science, nature, or unusual facts, I can go to my files or the at least 2,000 books that I have".|$|E
2500|$|A {{short time}} {{after their first}} meeting Burke told his friend Sir Joshua Reynolds that Crabbe had [...] "the mind and {{feelings}} of a gentleman." [...] Burke gave Crabbe the footing of a friend, admitting him to his family circle at Beaconsfield. There he was given an apartment, supplied <b>with</b> <b>books,</b> <b>and</b> made {{a member of the}} family. The time he spent with Burke and his family helped by enlarging his knowledge and ideas, and introducing him to many new and valuable friends including Charles James Fox and Samuel Johnson. He completed his unfinished poems and revised others with the help of Burke's criticism. Burke helped him have his poem, The Library, published anonymously in June 1781, by a publisher that had previously refused some of his work. The Library was greeted with modest praise from critics, and slight public appreciation.|$|E
2500|$|Eliot's {{childhood}} {{infatuation with}} literature can be ascribed to several factors. Firstly, {{he had to}} overcome physical limitations as a child. Struggling from a congenital double inguinal hernia, he could not participate in many physical activities and thus was prevented from socializing with his peers. As he was often isolated, his love for literature developed. Once he learned to read, the young boy immediately became obsessed <b>with</b> <b>books</b> <b>and</b> was absorbed in tales depicting savages, the Wild West, or Mark Twain's thrill-seeking Tom Sawyer. In his memoir of Eliot, his friend Robert Sencourt comments that the young Eliot [...] "would often curl up in the window-seat behind an enormous book, setting the drug of dreams against the pain of living." [...] Secondly, Eliot credited his hometown with fuelling his literary vision: [...] "It is self-evident that St. Louis affected me more deeply than any other environment has ever done. I {{feel that there is}} something in having passed one's childhood beside the big river, which is incommunicable to those people who have not. I consider myself fortunate to have been born here, rather than in Boston, or New York, or London." ...|$|E

2500|$|Now {{with many}} {{connections}} from Florence, Milton had {{easy access to}} Rome's intellectual circles, including groups like the Fantastici. His poetic abilities impressed such as Giovanni Salzilli, who honoured Milton in an epigram; this praise was later mentioned {{in the preface to}} the Latin portion of Milton's Poems of 1645. In return for this poetic generosity, Milton returned the favour in his Latin Ad Salzillum, which discusses his own merits and laments that Salzilli was ill at the time. In late October, Milton, despite his dislike for the Society of Jesus, attended a dinner given by the English College, Rome, meeting English Catholics who were also guests, theologian Henry Holden and the poet Patrick Cary. There is little else known about this time beyond that he met David Codner, an English Benedictine with court connections, who also praised Milton's poetry, and that he attended various musical events, including oratorios, operas, and melodramas. [...] Milton left for Naples near the end of November and he stayed only for a month, finding that Spanish control diminished the local intellectual and artistic community. He was introduced to Giovanni Battista Manso, patron to both Torquato Tasso and to Giovanni Battista Marino. Manso became Milton's guide through Naples and gifted Milton <b>with</b> <b>books</b> <b>and</b> a distich that teases Milton through Gregory the Great's pun on [...] "Angle" [...] and [...] "angel" [...] when describing the English. Milton responded in his Mansus that he was grateful for the gesture of good will and claims Manso as his patron.|$|E
