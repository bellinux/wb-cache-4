25|$|Captain Lord {{had gone}} to the {{chartroom}} at 11:00p.m. to spend the night; however, Second Officer Herbert Stone, now on duty, notified Lord at 1:10a.m. that the ship had fired five rockets. Lord wanted to know if they were company signals, that is, coloured flares used for identification. Stone said {{that he did not know}} and that the rockets were all white. Captain Lord instructed the crew to continue to signal the other vessel with the Morse lamp, and <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> Three more rockets were observed at 1:50a.m. and Stone noted that the ship looked strange in the water, as if she were listing. At 2:15a.m., Lord was notified that the ship could no longer be seen. Lord asked again if the lights had had any colours in them, and he was informed that they were all white.|$|E
500|$|In the evening, Turner {{called a}} conference on his command ship off Guadalcanal with Crutchley and Marine {{commander}} Major General Alexander A. Vandegrift to discuss the departure of Fletcher's carriers and the resulting withdrawal schedule for the transport ships. At 20:55, Crutchley left the southern group in Australia to attend the conference, leaving Captain Howard D. Bode of Chicago {{in charge of the}} southern group. Crutchley did not inform the commanders of the other cruiser groups of his absence, contributing further to the dissolution of command arrangements. Bode, awakened from sleep in his cabin, decided not to place his ship in the lead of the southern group of ships, the customary place for the senior ship, and <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> At the conference, Turner, Crutchley, and Vandegrift discussed the reports of the [...] "seaplane tender" [...] force reported by the Australian Hudson crew earlier that day. They decided {{it would not be a}} threat that night, because seaplane tenders did not normally engage in a surface action. Vandegrift said that he would need to inspect the transport unloading situation at Tulagi before recommending a withdrawal time for the transport ships, and he departed at midnight to conduct the inspection. Crutchley elected not to return with Australia to the southern force but instead stationed his ship just outside the Guadalcanal transport anchorage, without informing the other Allied ship commanders of his intentions or location.|$|E

In the morning, Pharaoh was troubled and sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt and told them his dream, but none could interpret it. Then the chief butler spoke up, confessing his faults and relating how Pharaoh had put him in prison with the baker, and a Hebrew there had interpreted their dreams, correctly predicting the future. Pharaoh sent for Joseph, who shaved, changed clothes, and came to Pharaoh. The first reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E

2500|$|The shuttle astronauts went {{to sleep}} as planned but were awakened {{by the sound of}} a master alarm on board Atlantis at 22:07 GMT. The tone {{signaled}} a failure with one of Atlantis's five IBM AP-101 General Purpose Computers (GPCs) No. 4. The alarm prompted Commander Ferguson to head to Atlantis and evaluate the issue. GPC-4 was running system management software at the time of failure. Ferguson with the help of Ground Control later transferred the failed GPC's programs onto GPC-2. The transfer took about 45 minutes, bypassing an expected period of loss of signal by utilizing communications at White Sands, New Mexico. After activating GPC-2 and with Atlantis in good shape, Ferguson and other crew members <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> [...] "You all have done an absolutely fabulous job.

Ahab told Queen Jezebel how Elijah had killed all the prophets of Baal, and Jezebel sent a {{messenger}} to tell Elijah that she intended to have him killed by the next day in recompense. So Elijah ran for his life to Beersheba in the Kingdom of Judah, left his servant there, and went a day's journey into the wilderness. Elijah sat down under a broom tree, asked God to take his life, and lay down and slept. An angel touched Elijah and told him to arise and eat, and Elijah found at his head a cake and a jar of water, and so he ate, drank, and <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> The angel again touched him again and told him to arise and eat, and he did and on the strength of that meal journeyed 40 days and 40 nights to Mount Horeb, the mount of God.|$|E

5000|$|A {{variant of}} this {{solution}} {{could use a}} single condition variable for both producers and consumers, perhaps named [...] "queueFullOrEmptyCV" [...] or [...] "queueSizeChangedCV". In this case, more than one condition {{is associated with the}} condition variable, such that the condition variable represents a weaker condition than the conditions being checked by individual threads. The condition variable represents threads that are waiting for the queue to be non-full and ones waiting for it to be non-empty. However, doing this would require using notifyAll in all the threads using the condition variable and cannot use a regular signal. This is because the regular signal might wake up a thread of the wrong type whose condition has not yet been met, and that thread would <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> without a thread of the correct type getting signalled. For example, a producer might make the queue full and wake up another producer instead of a consumer, and the woken producer would <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> In the complementary case, a consumer might make the queue empty and wake up another consumer instead of a producer, and the consumer would <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> Using notifyAll ensures that some thread of the right type will proceed as expected by the problem statement.|$|R
