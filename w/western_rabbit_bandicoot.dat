40|$|For humans, strong {{evidence}} indicates that some mucosal papillomavirus (PV) types cause genital and oral neoplasia, and weaker evidence suggests that some cutaneous PVs may cause cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). For nonhuman species, {{strong evidence}} supports a causal role of PVs {{in the development of}} feline and equine sarcoids. Likewise, PVs are believed to cause cutaneous SCCs in <b>rabbits,</b> <b>western</b> barred <b>bandicoots,</b> and some rodents. Furthermore, some evidence suggests that PVs may influence the development of both feline and canine cutaneous SCCs. This review discusses the evidence that PVs cause human cutaneous SCCs and the proposed mechanisms for this action. It then reviews preneoplastic and neoplastic skin diseases that are associated with PV infection in nonhuman mammals...|$|R

40|$|Background: Despite {{the limited}} success {{after decades of}} {{intensive}} research and development efforts, vaccination still represents the most promising strategy to significantly reduce the disease burden in malaria endemic regions. Besides {{the ultimate goal of}} inducing sterile protection in vaccinated individuals, the prevention of transmission by so-called transmission blocking vaccines (TBVs) is being regarded as an important feature of an efficient malaria eradication strategy. Recently, Plasmodium falciparum GAP 50 (PfGAP 50), a 44. 6 kDa transmembrane protein that forms {{an essential part of the}} invasion machinery (glideosome) multi-protein complex, has been proposed as novel potential transmission-blocking candidate. Plant-based expression systems combine the advantages of eukaryotic expression with a up-scaling potential and a good product safety profile suitable for vaccine production.

The new population was derived from 14 animals, reintroduced to Heirisson Prong from Dorre Island in Shark Bay, Western Australia. Introduced predators (the European red fox and the feral cat) were controlled at the reintroduction site, but European rabbits were not. A large fenced area of natural vegetation within the reintroduction site {{was used as a}} secure refuge from mammalian predators. Bandicoots were released from this predator refuge to the 12 km 2 conservation site. Dispersal from the point of free release was minimal. The reintroduced population has persisted for 4 years and increased, with at least 175 bandicoots recruited to the population in this time. The recapture rate of marked bandicoots was low, suggesting that adult mortality was high. Reproductive output at Heirisson Prong appeared greater than that of the two surviving wild populations on Bernier and Dorre Islands. Litter size was similar, but there was an extended annual breeding season at the reintroduction site. Body condition of reintroduced and wild bandicoots were similar, although there was some indication that reintroduced males may have been in poorer condition than their island counterparts. The litter size of bandicoots increased with a decrease in <b>rabbit</b> abundance, however, <b>bandicoots</b> were able to reproduce, maintain condition, and sustain recruitment to allow the population to increase despite the presence of rabbits.
