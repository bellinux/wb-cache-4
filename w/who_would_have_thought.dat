25|$|<b>Who</b> <b>Would</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Thought</b> It? is a {{historical}} romance. Writing during the nineteenth century, Ruiz de Burton drew upon the classical tradition and European influence. However, her use of realism and naturalism distinguishes this novel from other historical romances at the time.|$|E
25|$|Conventions of domesticity in {{the nineteenth}} century {{reinforced}} the idea that women should remain at home to look after the family. <b>Who</b> <b>Would</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Thought</b> It? does not follow the typical romance of domesticity because it introduces women from the domestic sphere into political and public spheres. The novel is situated during a time of modernization in the United States during which the home was transformed. The novel also parodies mid-nineteenth-century family life.|$|E
25|$|María Ruiz de Burton's <b>Who</b> <b>Would</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Thought</b> It? (1872) was {{the first}} novel to be written in English by a Mexican living in the United States. After a long period in which Ruiz de Burton's work was almost {{completely}} unknown, the novel was rediscovered by critics interested {{in the history of}} Chicano literature, and republished to acclaim in 1995. Yet Ruiz de Burton's life was not particularly typical of the Mexican-American experience, as she married a prominent US officer, Captain Henry S. Burton, {{in the aftermath of the}} Mexican–American War. The novel reflects her ambiguous position between the Californio elite and the Anglo-Saxon majority of the United States.|$|E

25|$|Ruiz de Burton uses {{irony and}} satire to mock American {{political}} discourses and practices by ridiculing socio-political {{structures of the}} period. Using a variety of rogues, who have pretentious and comical names, Ruiz de Burton represents the vices of nineteenth-century middle-class society. The preachers, Mr. Hackwell and Mr. Hammerhard, the neighbors, the Cackles, and other political figures in <b>Who</b> <b>Would</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Thought</b> It? are unmasked to break down ideological myths of American political rhetoric by contrasting {{the expectations of the}} nation with the reality of their actions. American expectations include promoting civil virtue and acting against corruption. However, Mr. Hackwell, the primary religious figure in the novel, schemes to increase his wealth in order to satisfy his ravenous greed. The Cackles clan represents Northern politicians who are only motivated by self-interest. Ruiz de Burton implies that the national practice of self-deception, misrepresentation and secrecy are deeply rooted in the American character, though very rarely revealed. Juxtaposed to this satire of American life are the virtues of the good and beautiful Lola.|$|E

The film {{became one of}} the biggest box office hits in India, earning , and grossed over [...] abroad, the biggest Bollywood success of all-time in the overseas market up until then. It was her fourth overseas top-earner in four consecutive years. The film tells the story of two unhappily married couples in New York, and an ensuing extramarital affair. Zinta played the role of Rhea Saran, an ambitious fashion magazine editor. She described the role as an attempt to shed her vivacious public image. The Indian Express concurred that this was successful: [...] "The lady has not just looked glamorous but she has walked with poise, sat with grace, smiled with composure and spoken with calmness. <b>Who</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> that the bubbly girl could so skilfully shed her age-old tag and walk away as the don't-mess-with-me lass.

2500|$|After its publication, <b>Who</b> <b>Would</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Thought</b> It? {{remained}} relatively unnoticed for {{over one hundred}} years in American literary studies, demonstrating Ruiz de Burton's exclusion from American literary history and more broadly the marginal importance that Mexican-Americans were considered to have in American history.
