5|$|Braithwaite {{was taken}} to Enfield Police Station and interviewed by Det Sgt Dermot McDermott and Detective Constable Colin Biggar. He was held {{for three days and}} was at first denied access to a lawyer, on the {{instruction}} of Det Ch Supt Melvin. He was interviewed eight times over the first two days, and <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> present four times on the third. During the first 30 hours of his detention he had nothing to eat, and said in court – as did several other suspects – that the heat in the cells was oppressive, making it difficult to breathe.|$|E
5|$|Rita {{finds out}} from a county sheriff that Paul, her abusive ex-husband who {{attacked}} her the night before, is pressing charges against her for assault. She talks <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer,</b> who tells her that since she invited Paul into her house, she cannot prove that her intent was to defuse the situation. At a hearing, it is revealed that Rita violated her and Paul's custody agreement, making Paul's case against her even stronger. When Paul drops by Rita's house to return their children, he threatens Dexter when the two are alone in the kitchen, and Dexter responds by hitting him with a frying pan. Paul loses consciousness, so Dexter drives his body back to Paul's hotel and frames him for drug abuse. Dexter alerts the police and Paul is sent back to prison.|$|E

5|$|Dave Matthews Band is an American rock band, {{formed in}} Charlottesville, Virginia in 1991 by singer-songwriter and guitarist Dave Matthews. Other band members include bassist Stefan Lessard, violinist Boyd Tinsley, and drummer Carter Beauford. In November 1990, Matthews became friends <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> named Ross Hoffman while a {{bartender}} in Charlottesville. Hoffman convinced Matthews {{to create a}} demo album of a few songs that he had written. Matthews then shared the demo with other musicians, including Beauford and Moore. Both of them, who were jazz musicians at the time, joined Matthews after hearing the demo. The band has released eight studio albums, all with RCA Records: Under the Table and Dreaming (1994), Crash (1996), Before These Crowded Streets (1998), Everyday (2001), Busted Stuff (2002), Stand Up (2005), Big Whiskey and the GrooGrux King (2009), Away from the World (2012).

5|$|Upon {{returning}} to the hospital on 12 July for a tetanus injection, Behan was arrested by five policemen and taken to their Arcidosso barracks for questioning. He {{did not know what}} was happening at first as the police had no interpreter in the barracks. He was only provided <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> and interpreter 15 hours later when a magistrate from Grosseto came. Behan exercised his right not to answer questions. He was released, but was formally informed that he was under suspicion. As of 15 July 2008 he was the only suspect in the case. The police subsequently seized his car and a knife from his home, and secured a room in the house in which traces of blood were allegedly found. In addition, shoe prints found were said to have matched his footwear. Custody of his car and home (except for the cellar) were returned to him on 14 July by the judge overseeing the investigation.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Bonham {{had been}} {{admitted}} to St John's College, Cambridge, in 1581. Earning a bachelor's degree in 1584, he completed a master's by 1588 and studied for a medical doctorate at Cambridge, which was later granted by the University of Oxford. By 1602, he had completed his studies and moved to London, where he practised medicine and associated himself with the Barber-Surgeons' Company, campaigning {{for it to be}} allowed to authorise medical practitioners in a similar way to the College of Physicians. Apparently giving up after a failed petition to Parliament in 1605, Bonham petitioned to join the college on 6 December 1605 but was rejected and told to return after further study. Returning on 14 April 1606, he was again told he could not join and was fined £5 and threatened with imprisonment for continuing to practise. Bonham still kept working as a doctor; on 3 October it was announced he was to be arrested and fined £10. Bonham again appeared before the college, now <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer,</b> on 7 November. He announced that he would continue to practise without seeking the college's permission, which he claimed had no power over graduates of Oxford or Cambridge. He was then imprisoned (some say at Fleet Prison, and some say at Newgate Prison) for contempt, but his lawyer had a writ of habeas corpus, issued by the Court of Common Pleas, which freed him on 13 November.|$|E

This was an unexpected step for the band, as Essential was the smallest company that they interviewed with, but they felt it was most like a family. In addition, Essential had solid backing power from the larger Brentwood Music company which owned it, and Brentwood used a secular distributor, Silvertone Records of Zomba/Jive, {{in order to reach}} a wider audience.|$|E

Instead, he suggested they should have gone further and argued that homosexual activity was harmful to families and to American society as a whole.

25|$|In the late-1980s, {{producer}} Dr. Dre was {{a member}} of N.W.A, signed to friend Eazy E's Ruthless Records. As head of production at the label, Dre produced a large number of Ruthless projects, many of them successful; feeling the pressures of having to produce so many acts and feeling he was underpaid, Dr. Dre became frustrated with Ruthless Records. After the departure of Ice Cube in 1989 over financial disagreements with N.W.A. manager Jerry Heller, Suge Knight and fellow Ruthless artist, The D.O.C. went over the books <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer.</b> Convinced that Heller was dishonest, they approached Dr. Dre about forming a label with them, away from Heller and Eazy-E.

500|$|In {{the weeks}} after Feng Jianmei's story went public, the family {{suffered}} from what Zhang called [...] "state-backed harassment."

500|$|The court then {{considered}} {{whether the}} accused had taken action that waived those rights. Waiver {{must be a}} free choice with full awareness (Moran v. Burbine). Miranda v.

[...] It was noted that the accused had read and expressed understanding of the rights, and had them read aloud, he had not pleaded lack of understanding, was given time, and therefore knew his rights. Specifically, having read the 5th warning ("you have the right to decide at any time before or during questioning to use your right to remain silent and your right to talk <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> while you are being questioned") he was aware this right was enduring and could be applied {{at any time in the}} questioning if he chose, and the police would have to honor the invocation if he did so. The court observed that [...] "olice are not required to rewarn suspects from time to time". That a question is linked to religious beliefs does not cause the reply to be [...] "involuntary". The accused, understanding his rights and that they were capable of invocation at any point, had not chosen to invoke them.|$|E
