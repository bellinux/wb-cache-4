50|$|The {{container}} of the Bubblers {{is similar to}} the construction of a gas <b>washing</b> <b>bottle</b> and used for the protected storage of metalorganic compounds to exclude air (oxygen, moisture). The bubbler has a supply pipe and a sampling tube. The inlet tube ends just before the bottom of the tube. In this tube, an inert gas is introduced, which bubbles through the liquid chemical; a solid chemical will sublime. The mixture of the controlled inert gas and the vaporized chemical leaves the cylinder into a downstream reaction vessel. The temperature is controlled by a thermostat, so that a defined, constant steam pressure can be achieved. The supply of the often expensive and sensitive chemical is controlled by the regulated flow of inert gas and the temperature of the bubbler, resulting in a given vapor pressure of the chemical.|$|E

40|$|The nitrite {{equivalent}} of nitrogen dioxide in its determination in polluted air {{by means of}} a Griess type reagent is commonly called the Saltzman factor. Values ranging from 0. 5 to 1. 000 have been reported, but discussion about the 'right' value continues. The results of experimental calculations are presented to demonstrate that there is no set right value, but that it depends on circumstances and may be more or less chosen at will. No explanation was found for the differences reported. The results are summarized, and illustrate that the Saltzman factor is not a constant, but is inversely related to NO production and varies according to the expectations based on the expounded reaction mechanisms. In practice, a method with a high and therefore more constant factor would be recommended, {{such as the use of}} sulfanilamide instead of sulfanilic acid and a NEDA (naphthylethylene diamine dihydrochloride) concentration as low as possible without decreasing the collection efficiency too much with the air flow rate and <b>washing</b> <b>bottle.</b> Chemicals/CAS: nitrogen dioxide, 10102 - 44 -...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPanarea is a {{submarine}} volcanic caldera between the active volcanoes Stromboli and Vulcano, Aeolian Islands, Italy. Many locations within the caldera at a water depth between 10 and 30 m {{are characterized by}} emissions of hot water (partly boiling) and gases (fumaroles). The fumaroleś gas consists mainly of CO 2 (96 to 99. 5 %) with H 2 S being the second most abundant component. To investigate trace gases and in particular aerosols, volatile metals, and metalloids like arsenic a technique was used which allows sampling tens and even hundreds of litres of gas. The sampling system is rather simple: a stainless steel funnel, a 100 m long PE hose with an inner diameter of 4 mm and a gas bag (10 to 80 litres). After sampling, the gas is pumped into a PTFE <b>washing</b> <b>bottle</b> containing NaOCl in supra pure water which is effectively oxidizing organic compounds like methylated metals, other reduced species, and aerosols.

40|$|Biogas {{has been}} {{exploited}} {{as one of the}} alternative sources of renewable energy having the potential to replace fossil fuels. It contains impurities when raw, as it consists of 50 â 70 % methane (CH 4), 30 â 50 % carbon dioxide (CO 2) and trace gases such as hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S). Chemical absorption is often a preferred purification technique in industrial applications because it has high efficiencies, removes H 2 S completely, operates at low pressures, and has higher reaction rates. The focus of this study is on amines as they are widely used worldwide to purify biogas. A continuous system was used where 1 Â L digester was used for biogas production which was bubbled through an absorbent in 500 Â mL gas <b>washing</b> <b>bottle.</b> The gas exiting the absorption column was analyzed using Gas Chromatography. The methane yield obtained in this study was higher because MEA is a good absorbent. The biomethane potential was found to be 0. 40 Â m 3 CH 4 /kg VS (volatile solids). An increase in concentration resulted in increased co 2 absorption capacity and rate, an average of 76 %, 78 %, and 84 % vol from an initial concentration of 52 % vol were achieved for the respective concentrations. The CH 4 content of the purified biogas improved with increasing temperature. The removal efficiency of carbon dioxide increased from 66 % at room temperature to 77 % at 40 Â Â°C. Temperature of the solvent increased the absorption capacity and carbon dioxide removal efficiency of the process.

40|$|Bench-scale {{studies with}} mercury {{contaminated}} soil were {{performed at the}} SRTC to determine the optimum waste loading obtainable in the glass product without sacrificing durability, leach resistance, and processability. Vitrifying this waste stream also required offgas treatment for the capture of the vaporized mercury. Four soil glasses with slight variations in composition were produced, which were capable of passing the Product Consistency Test (PCT) and the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP). The optimum glass feed composition contained 60 weight percent soil and produced a soda-lime-silica glass when melted at 1, 350 C. The glass additives used to produce this glass were 24 weight percent Na{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } and 16 weight percent CaCO{sub 3 }. Volatilized mercury released during the vitrification process was released to the proposed mercury collection system. The proposed mercury collection system consisted of quartz and silica tubing with a Na{sub 2 }S <b>wash</b> <b>bottle</b> followed by a NaOH <b>wash</b> <b>bottle.</b> Once in the system, the volatile mercury would pass through the <b>wash</b> <b>bottle</b> containing Na{sub 2 }S, {{where it would be}} converted to Hg{sub 2 }S, which is a stable form of mercury. However, attempts to capture the volatilized mercury in a Na{sub 2 }S solution <b>wash</b> <b>bottle</b> were not as successful as anticipated. Maximum mercury captured was only about 3. 24 % of the mercury contained in the feed. Mercury capture efforts then shifted to condensing and capturing the volatilized mercury. These attempts were much more successful at capturing the volatile mercury, with a capture efficiency of 34. 24 % when dry ice was used to pack the condenser. This captured mercury was treated on a mercury specific resin after digestion of the volatilized mercury...|$|R
