25|$|In London a {{completely}} different model was used {{from the rest of}} the country; the Transport Act brought about the privatisation of London bus services, which required an arms-length subsidiary company of London Transport called London Buses to be set up with the remit to contract out the operation of services, but to determine service levels, routes, frequencies and fares <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> sector.|$|E
25|$|According to Moghadam, {{women are}} victims of clear political, economic, and social disparities in many Islamic {{countries}} which create gender distinctions <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> and private spheres.

25|$|On 3 May 2010, Lee {{enlisted in}} the Republic of Korea Army to serve his {{mandatory}} military service. He first underwent five weeks of basic training at Nonsan military training camp and was later drafted into active duty.

He was also chosen to represent Korea as a goodwill ambassador at the 2010 Shanghai Expo.

25|$|In the United States alone—before {{initiation}} of the rotavirus vaccination programme—over 2.7million cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis occurred annually, 60,000 children were hospitalised and around 37 {{died from the}} results of the infection. The major role of rotavirus in causing diarrhoea is not widely recognised <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> health community, particularly in developing countries. Almost every child has been infected with rotavirus by age five. It is the leading single cause of severe diarrhoea among infants and children, being responsible for about 20% of cases, and accounts for 50% of the cases requiring hospitalisation. Rotavirus causes 37% of deaths attributable to diarrhoea and 5% of all deaths in children younger than five. Boys are twice as likely as girls to be admitted to hospital.|$|E

At Jordanhill College, Macdonald chaired the PTA Action Committee, which campaigned successfully for the school's survival as a local primary and secondary <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> sector.

25|$|In one {{instance}} of DRM {{that caused a}} rift with consumers, Amazon.com in July 2009, remotely deleted purchased copies of George Orwell's Animal Farm (1945) and Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) from customers' Amazon Kindles after providing them a refund for the purchased products. Commentors have described these actions as Orwellian and have compared Amazon to Big Brother from Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. After Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos issued a public apology, the Free Software Foundation wrote {{that this was just}} one more example of the excessive power Amazon has to remotely censor what people read through its software, and called upon Amazon to free its e-book reader and drop DRM. Amazon then revealed the reason behind its deletion: the e-books in question were unauthorized reproductions of Orwell's works, which were not <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> domain and to which the company that published and sold them on Amazon's service had no rights.|$|E

The ridge boasts a substantial network of hiking trails and park roads, cliffs, rugged woodlands, scenic ponds and reservoirs, and waterfalls.
