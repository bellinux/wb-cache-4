40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} the reachability problem for {{fragments of the}} Mobile Ambients, a powerful model for distributed and mobile computation. By using a connection with associative-commutative term rewriting, we prove that reachability is decidable in the open-free fragment of pure Mobile Ambients with name restriction and weak reduction semantics. Processes in this model have three sources of infiniteness: depth <b>of</b> ambients, <b>width</b> <b>of</b> parallel <b>composition,</b> and number <b>of</b> restricted names. Our work extends similar results obtained for public fragments of Mobile Ambients...|$|R

He initially took up piano and viola as instruments, but playing with bands in his teenage years, he also {{learned to play}} guitar, bass and drums. He enrolled in Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama (now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland) to study music composition. His pieces were performed by various ensembles across the UK. His music takes in both classical and modern music and {{have been described as}} combining lush choral harmonies and acoustic instrumentation, textured like contemporary dreampop, and a cross of lo-fi folk with the harmonic <b>width</b> <b>of</b> choral <b>composition.</b>|$|R

We are {{not in a position to}} know exactly how the building was lit, nor what colors Polygnotos used to create his painting compositions. There is also disagreement as to whether they were painted directly onto the walls (i.e. Frescoes) or on to wooden slabs which were then hung on the walls. Also unknown are the height, the length and the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the <b>compositions,</b> except only through unconfirmed assumptions.In the course of the 4th century B.C., to the south of the monument was built a wall made of local limestone, on which were possibly exhibited votive offerings, according to the model of the Athenian Treasury.|$|R

Enhancement of the interference fringe amplitude in the specular scatter {{and the absence of}} changes in the diffuse scatter indicate that the sharpening is not a reduction in topological roughness but a reduction in the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the chemical <b>composition</b> profile across the interface. The temperature at which the sharpening occurs corresponds to that at which a maximum is found in the tunneling magnetoresistance of magnetic tunnel junctions...|$|R
40|$|The {{palace and}} garden complex in Otwock Wielki is {{situated}} in the Masovian voivodeship, southeast of Warsaw. The palace complex with the main garden establishment on the island on the Rokola Lake {{is an example of}} a classic late baroque garden from the turn of the 17 th cen­tury. The main goal of the study was to analyse the spatial composition and scenic connections of the palace and garden complex and to identify the accumulations from later transformations. The achievement of those goals might be used for determination of the bases of protection and cre­ation of the cultural landscape of this region and for revalorisation of the palace and garden complex in Otwock Wielki. As results from the field investigations and cartographic analyses of archival materials, the estate has retained numerous elements of a regular garden within the garden on the island. Apart from that, the accumulations of later transformations and the effects of revalorisation made after 1945 are still noticeable. Simple dimensional relationships are noticeable in the composition. They are based on the module making the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the main frontal façade of the palace, whereas major nodes <b>of</b> the <b>composition</b> could be found in the avant-corps of the palace front, in the fountain in the garden salon and at the junctions of main roads. The modifications of the module segments marking the lengths and <b>widths</b> <b>of</b> the <b>composition</b> elements changed at the 1  :  2 ratio. The main spatial elements were laid out according to the golden ratio proportions. The investigations and analyses prove that it is possible to restore the original spatial arrangement of the estate on the island...|$|R

The transmission efficiency is studied for various parameters including length, thickness, <b>width,</b> and <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> the antenna {{as well as the}} wavelength of incident light. The modeling and simulation of these structures is done using 3 -D finite element method based full-wave solutions of Maxwell’s equations. Next, a modeling-based automated design optimization framework is developed to optimize nano-antennas. The electromagnetic model is integrated with optimization solvers such as gradient-based optimization tools and genetic algorithms...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{explosion}} models for Type Ia Supernovae, we present one- and two-dimensional simulations of fully resolved detonation fronts in degenerate C+O White Dwarf matter including clumps of previously burned material. The ability of detonations to survive the passage through sheets of nuclear ashes is tested as a function <b>of</b> the <b>width</b> and <b>composition</b> <b>of</b> the ash region. We show that detonation fronts are quenched by microscopically thin obstacles with little sensitivity to the exact ash composition. Front-tracking models for detonations in macroscopic explosion simulations need to include this effect in order to predict the amount of unburned material in delayed detonation scenarios.
