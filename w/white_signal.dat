5|$|While on {{the move}} the lead {{vehicles}} of the patrol commanders and sergeants flew a small flag. Because the LRP was organised on divisional cavalry lines the leaders carried green flags for 'A' (HQ) Troop, black for 'B' Troop, yellow for 'C' Troop and red for 'D'. When the LRDG was organised into 11 vehicle patrols this was simplified to a green flag displaying the patrol letter in white; the later half-patrols used a plain green flag on occasion. When it became necessary to change course from an intended route, or {{in the event of}} enemy action, patrol movements were controlled by a simple semaphore flag system using blue and <b>white</b> <b>signal</b> flags, or hand signals, depending on how widely dispersed the trucks were.|$|E
25|$|The HSL {{color space}} {{was invented in}} 1938 by Georges Valensi as a method to add color {{encoding}} to existing monochrome (i.e. only containing the L signal) broadcasts, allowing existing receivers to receive new color broadcasts (in black and white) without modification as the Luminance (black and <b>white)</b> <b>signal</b> is broadcast unmodified. It {{has been used in}} all major analog broadcast television encoding including NTSC, PAL and SECAM and all major digital broadcast systems and is the basis for composite video.|$|E
25|$|The NTSC and PAL TV norms {{call for}} a {{compliant}} TV screen to display an electrically black and <b>white</b> <b>signal</b> (minimal color saturation) at a color temperature of 6500K. On many consumer-grade televisions, {{there is a very}} noticeable deviation from this requirement. However, higher-end consumer-grade televisions can have their color temperatures adjusted to 6500K by using a preprogrammed setting or a custom calibration. Current versions of ATSC explicitly call for the color temperature data {{to be included in the}} data stream, but old versions of ATSC allowed this data to be omitted. In this case, current versions of ATSC cite default colorimetry standards depending on the format. Both of the cited standards specify a 6500K color temperature.|$|E

The detonation of the mine alerted the Germans and British troops failed to occupy all of the mine crater, before German troops arrived and took over the far lip. Many troops of both brigades were shot down in no man's land, which was dominated by Redan Ridge and then caught by German artillery barrages. German <b>white</b> <b>signal</b> rockets were seen and taken for British success flares, which led the divisional commander Major-General de Lisle to order the 88th Brigade from reserve, to exploit the success. The brigade included the Newfoundland Regiment, which advanced on open ground from reserve trenches [...] back from the British front line.|$|E

60|$|The two {{men were}} both busy with their bicycle still, but now from among the trees emerged the massive bulk of a 'Marlborough Club' tandem, ridden by a slender woman in grey and a burly man in a Norfolk jacket. Following close upon this came lank black figure in a piebald straw hat, riding a {{tricycle}} of antiquated pattern with two large wheels in front. The man in grey remained bowed over the bicycle, with his stomach resting on the saddle, but his companion stood up and addressed some remark to the tricycle riders. Then {{it seemed as if}} he pointed up hill to where Mr. Hoopdriver and his companion stood side by side. A still odder thing followed; the lady in grey took out her handkerchief, appeared to wave it for a moment, and then at a hasty motion from her companion the <b>white</b> <b>signal</b> vanished.|$|E
60|$|He put his {{handkerchief}} through the window-slit, {{so that it}} fluttered outside, and, fixing it in its place by a large stone drawn from the loose ones around him, awaited succour as best he could. To begin this course of procedure was easy, but to abide in patience till it should produce fruit was an irksome task. As nearly as he could guess--for his watch had been stopped by the fall--it was now about four o'clock, {{and it would be}} scarcely possible for evening to approach without some eye or other noticing the <b>white</b> <b>signal.</b> So Somerset waited, his eyes lingering on the little world of objects around him, till they all became quite familiar. Spiders'-webs in plenty were there, and one in particular just before him was in full use as a snare, stretching across the arch of the window, with radiating threads as its ribs. Somerset had plenty of time, and he counted their number--fifteen. He remained so silent that the owner of this elaborate structure soon forgot the disturbance which had resulted in the breaking of his diagonal ties, and crept out from the corner to mend them. In watching the process, Somerset noticed that on the stonework behind the web sundry names and initials had been cut by explorers in years gone by. Among these antique inscriptions he observed two bright and clean ones, consisting of the words 'De Stancy' and 'W. Dare,' crossing each other at right angles. From the state of the stone they could not have been cut more than a month before this date, and, musing on the circumstance, Somerset passed the time until the sun reached the slit in that side of the tower, where, beginning by throwing in a streak of fire as narrow as a corn-stalk, it enlarged its width till the dusty nook was flooded with cheerful light. It disclosed something lying in the corner, which on examination proved to be a dry bone. Whether it was human, or had come from the castle larder in bygone times, he could not tell. One bone was not a whole skeleton, but it made him think of Ginevra of Modena, the heroine of the Mistletoe Bough, and other cribbed and confined wretches, who had fallen into such traps and been discovered after a cycle of years.|$|E
