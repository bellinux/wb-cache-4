In weaving plants, electricity intensity ranges from 1. 2 MWh/tonne fabric to 2. 2 MWh/tonne fabric, while fuel intensity was 10. 1 MBtu/tonne fabric and 16. 4 MBtu/tonne fabric for the two plants studied. In three wet-processing plants, the electricity intensity was found to be between 1. 5 MWh/tonne finished fabric and 2. 5 MWh/tonne finished fabric, while the fuel intensity was between 38. 2 MBtu/tonne finished fabric and 106. 3 MBtu/tonne finished fabric.

The book is attributed to J. Tuthill & Son(s) whose manufactory was located in the parish of St. George Colegate, Norwich (see 65 [*]×[*] 695.3 in [3]). Chosen for study because of its pristine condition, it contains 685 swatches grouped and named by fabric type with dimensions of completed pieces in inches and yards.

40|$|Abstract: Pilling is {{a serious}} {{problems}} in clothes, not only impairs its appearance but also reduces its service life. Several factors involved have been identified by some researchers. In this paper the combined effect of weave type and weave density on pilling has been studied. <b>Worsted</b> <b>fabrics</b> with plain, twill 2 / 1 and twill 2 / 2 weave patterns and different warp/weft density are subjected to abrasion test and pilling intensity is evaluated by counting the pills. It is shown that these two factors influence the total floating yarn length [L]. It is also shown that L has a considerable effect on pilling. An empirical equation is introduced relating the combined effect of weave type and fabric density to L. Also the effect of reduced ultimate bending stiffness on pilling has been tested by three kinds of low pilling polyester. ASTM D 4970 is used in this research. In this method for better displaying the results, instead of comparing the tested specimens with visual standards and evaluated degree of fabric pilling by scale ranging 5 to 1, the number of pills was counted. The results shows that the pilling decreased with increasing the yarn and fabric density however {{in order to preserve}} the products feature and properties, the use of modified polyester yarn are preferred which is also reducing the pilling...|$|R

There {{are a number of}} variables with a certain influence on the quality of fabrics, but some of these variables are more important than others, so it is useful to identify those variables to a better understanding the factors which can lead the improving of the fabrics quality. A solution to this problem can be the application of a method of factorial analysis, the so-called Principal Component Analysis, with the final goal of establishing and analyzing those variables which influence in a significant manner the internal structure of combed wool fabrics according to armire type. By applying PCA it is obtained a small number of the linear combinations (principal components) from a set of variables, describing the internal structure of the fabrics, which can hold as much information as possible from the original variables. Data analysis is an important initial step in decision making, allowing identification of the causes that lead to a decision- making situations. Thus it is the action of transforming the initial data in order to extract useful information and to facilitate reaching the conclusions.

The cross dyeing process can be used to create heather effects, and plaid, check, or striped fabrics.

40|$|Fabric woven from wool/polyester (PES) Murata vortex spun (MVS) blend yarn is {{a commercially}} viable {{proposition}} {{particularly on the}} basis of advantageous wear-resistant properties, compared with fabric made from traditional worsted ring-spun yarn. However, in some early industrial trials with fabric made from 45 / 55 -blend wool/PES MVS yarn, significantly greater relaxation shrinkage was found relative to comparable <b>worsted</b> ring-spun <b>fabric.</b> It was noted {{at the time that the}} amount of relaxation shrinkage in MVS fabric could be reduced to a large extent by using steamed MVS yarn. In this study, the extent of variations in the dimensional and mechanical properties of fabric samples woven from a combination of steamed and unsteamed MVS yarn and equivalent worsted ring-spun yarn is examined. In general, greater hygral expansion and relaxation shrinkage were found in loom-state fabrics made from unsteamed MVS yarns, whereas the fabric made from steamed MVS and ring-spun yarns gave relatively low levels of relaxation shrinkage and hygral expansion. Permanent setting of fabrics, by pressure steaming, was found to be more effective than yarn pre-steaming in reducing relaxation shrinkage levels of fabrics made from unsteamed MVS yarn. After pressure steaming, all fabrics showed similar levels of relaxation shrinkage and hygral expansion. Permanent setting of the fabrics, by pressure steaming, resulted in similar levels of relaxation shrinkage and hygral expansion, irrespective of the yarn production method; relaxation shrinkage fell to around 1 % and hygral expansion increased by about 1 %, relative to the loom-state samples. MVS fabrics were relatively heavier and fuller and had a firmer handle than the <b>worsted</b> ring-spun <b>fabrics,</b> reflecting the greater fabric weight, thickness and shear rigidity measured on these fabrics. These attributes are associated with different structures of the worsted ring-spun and MVS yarns used to make the fabrics. <br /...|$|R

Fabrics with defined enough ribs can be calendered with smooth rollers and produce a moire finish; however generally the rollers have ribs that correspond to the grain of the fabric.

Breeding management and marketing decisions may cause wools on the threshold of parameter values to shift between product-process groups with resulting different price-parameter premiums. Innovations in processing and product development can result in the formation of new groups and changes in the boundaries of the groups. This paper discusses the sources and quality of wool price information available to growers in New Zealand and highlights the need to relate this information to different product-process groups. In sheep breeding the optimum selection direction for economic improvement is usually based on current prices.

Forecasting wool prices, to construct a selection index requires prediction of these changes...|$|R
