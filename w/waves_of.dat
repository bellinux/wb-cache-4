Several such amplification cycles occur.

5|$|A {{cooperative}} mode {{was added}} to the game after its launch. It supports two players and features four missions. Players are tasked to defeat multiple <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> enemies and complete a series of objectives, similar to a horde mode.|$|E
5|$|As an extratropical storm, Leslie {{produced}} {{winds of}} around 40mph (65km/h) while making landfall in Newfoundland. It also caused <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> up to 16ft (fivem) in height, {{and brought up}} to onein (30mm) of rain. The overall impact in this region was minor.|$|E

40|$|The {{polarographic}} {{reduction of}} CO 2, COS, and CS 2 {{has been studied}} in several aprotic solvents and in DMF-water mixtures. COS gives one wave in most solvents, presumably by one-electron step, at less negative potential than the <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> CO 2 and at more negative than the first <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> CS 2, as expected. A week proton-donor, such as water or phenol affects on the second <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> CS 2, while benzoic acid on even the first wave in DMF. By {{the use of a}} higher alkyl-substituted tetraalkylammonium ion as the supporting electrolyte, the second <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> CS 2 shifts to more negative potential. Good liniarity is found between the donor number of the solvent and the half-wave potential <b>of</b> the <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> CO 2 and COS, and <b>of</b> the first <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> CS 2...|$|R
40|$|Lateral bending of {{the trunk}} during terrestrial, quadrupedal {{locomotion}} was analyzed in four species of lizards, using high-speed videography and computerized motion analysis. The focus of the analysis was whether lizards produce a standing or a traveling <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> bending in the trunk during locomotion. Lizards with well-developed limbs (Cnemidophorus tigris and Dipsosaurus dorsalis) exhibit a standing <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> lateral bending at low speeds, which {{is replaced by a}} traveling <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> bending as velocity increases. Lizards with diminutive limbs (Gerrhonotus kingii and Eumeces multivirgatus) exhibit a traveling <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> lateral bending, even at the lowest speeds recorded. These results are not consistent with the ideas that lizards produce a standing <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> lateral bending during locomotion or that amniote vertebrates have lost the ability to produce a traveling <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> lateral flexion due to a change in the central pattern generator that controls locomotion...|$|R

5|$|A study – {{conducted}} by He et al. – used a mechanistic modelling approach {{to study the}} three <b>waves</b> <b>of</b> the 1918 influenza pandemic.

Their analysis suggests that temporal variations in transmission rate provide the best explanation and the variation in transmission required to generate these three waves is within biologically plausible values.|$|E

5|$|Diffusion {{may also}} have had a {{significant}} effect on the evolution of primordial cosmic magnetic fields, fields which may have been amplified over time to become galactic magnetic fields. However, these cosmic magnetic fields may have been damped by radiative diffusion: just as acoustic oscillations in the plasma were damped by the diffusion of photons, so were magnetosonic waves (<b>waves</b> <b>of</b> ions travelling through a magnetised plasma). This process began before the era of neutrino decoupling and ended at the time of recombination.|$|E
