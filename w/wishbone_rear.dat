25|$|The third-generation RX's new {{transmission}} can lock-up its torque converter from 2nd through 6th gears to improve fuel economy. By dropping the center locking differential, a new Active Torque Control all-wheel drive system diverts anywhere from 50% {{or up to}} 100% power to the front wheels for reduced drivetrain associated efficiency losses which in turn increases fuel efficiency. An Electric Power Steering (EPS) system replaces the previous belt-driven hydraulic pump. A double <b>wishbone</b> <b>rear</b> suspension setup replaces the previous MacPherson strut design for improved handling and greater cargo space, while an optional Sports Package adds a performance-tuned suspension.|$|E
2500|$|Utilising {{the same}} fully {{independent}} four-link front suspension, and double <b>wishbone</b> <b>rear,</b> as its related A6 and S6, the RS6 was lowered by , with a 30% stiffer spring rate, and 40% increased compression damping. [...] The RS6 {{also served as}} the debut model for Audi's [...] "Dynamic Ride Control" [...] (DRC) system. [...] The DRC system is mainly mechanical, and uses a pump to provide additional pressure to individual dampers (shock absorbers) during cornering, acceleration or braking; to counteract rolling and pitching. [...] The system can adjust the stiffness at each individual damper constantly; to maintain both a comfortable ride on straight roads, and high level of poise and grip when cornering hard, accelerating, or braking. [...] The DRC's main advantage is that it operates {{without the need for}} complicated electronics, as required in similar systems from Mercedes-Benz and other competitors. Its main drawback is that the DRC dampers have been known to fail (leaking fluid from the cross-linked circuits), which can affect the handling and ride quality of the vehicle; some owners have reported needing multiple replacements of faulty DRC units and many drivers have opted to replace the system with simpler and more reliable aftermarket coilover suspension.|$|E
50|$|The Mojo 2 is a {{redesigned}} Mojo {{with independent}} double <b>wishbone</b> <b>rear</b> suspension. The body was redesigned at the rear, and 2 new nose designs introduced.|$|E

25|$|For space reasons, Oldsmobile adopted torsion {{bars for}} the Toronado's front {{suspension}} (the first GM passenger car application of torsion bars in the US, but {{still did not}} duplicate Packard's automatic ride leveling system. On a side note, European Opel and Vauxhall divisions used torsion bars in the 1930s and 1940s), with conventional, unequal-length double <b>wishbones.</b> <b>Rear</b> Toronado suspension was a simple beam axle on single leaf springs, unusual only in having dual shock absorbers, one vertical, one horizontal (allowing it {{to act as a}} radius rod to control wheel movement).|$|R
5000|$|As Volkswagen's first 4-door saloon, the Type 4 also {{introduced}} unibody construction, coil springs, trailing <b>wishbone</b> <b>rear</b> suspension, hydraulic clutch manual transmission [...] - [...] {{as well as}} MacPherson strut front suspension, subsequently adapted to the VW Type 1 1302/1303 ("Super Beetle").|$|E
5000|$|The {{independent}} double <b>wishbone</b> <b>rear</b> suspension {{has been}} redesigned for better handling and a smoother ride {{over the previous}} generation. [...] "Sportshift" [...] has been included with the four-speed computer-controlled automatic transmission. The in-dash, touch-screen satellite navigation system is Bluetooth compatible, and has the premium stereo integrated. Subaru also offers the six-speaker premium stereo, with surround sound enhancement, separate from the navigation system.|$|E
50|$|The {{successful}} mid-engined Lotus 18 of 1960 {{no longer}} had the high bodywork behind the driver's seat on which to mount the tops of the struts. Instead it used a <b>wishbone</b> <b>rear</b> suspension with wide-based tube lower wishbones carrying coilover shocks. The upper wishbones though were, once again {{in the style of the}} Chapman strut, using the driveshafts themselves and a front radius rod. This is similar to the Jaguar independent rear suspension, which also uses the driveshafts as an upper control arm.|$|E
50|$|Front wheel {{suspension}} was independent, with double <b>wishbones,</b> the <b>rear</b> used a solid axle. On all four wheels there were coil springs and telescopic dampers.Brakes were drums, with an hydraulic system.|$|R
50|$|Solar {{cars have}} {{a wide range of}} {{suspensions}} because of varying bodies and chassis. The most common front suspension is the double <b>wishbone</b> suspension. The <b>rear</b> suspension is often a trailing-arm suspension as found in motor cycles.|$|R
50|$|In 1971 the Minicab {{underwent}} {{its first}} model change, with the Minicab EL offering a new interior and a longer cargo bed. Called the T130 {{it was only}} available in truck form, with the old LT30 van soldiering on until the third generation was introduced in 1976. Ride quality was improved with {{the adoption of a}} front <b>wishbone</b> and <b>rear</b> leaf spring suspension. The EL received all new bodywork with tiny rectangular headlamps.|$|R
50|$|Subaru {{introduced}} {{improvements to}} the chassis, that they call Dynamic Chassis Control Concept, which uses high-tensile steel in critical areas to achieve high strength with lighter weight. The front-end structure introduces Cradle Mount that isolates the suspension and engine from the passenger compartment for a smoother and quieter ride using rubber mounts. New for this generation is a double <b>wishbone</b> <b>rear</b> suspension, with all suspension links and the rear differential isolated from the rear subframe with large rubber mounts to minimize noise and vibration intruding into the passenger compartment.|$|E

5000|$|For the 1960 {{season the}} FIA made {{changes to the}} {{regulation}} regarding the windscreen and cockpit size. These rules changes together with a larger (1.6-litre) Type 547/3 engine, developing [...] and a new double <b>wishbone</b> <b>rear</b> suspension brought about the RS 60 model. The RS 60 brought Porsche victory at the 1960 12 Hours of Sebring with a car driven by Hans Herrmann and Olivier Gendebien. 1960 also saw Porsche win the Targa Florio with Hans Herrmann being joined on the winner podium by Jo Bonnier and Graham Hill. The RS 60 also ensured that Porsche successfully defended their European Hill Climb Championship {{for the third year}} in a row.|$|E
50|$|Designed in 1985 and {{completed}} in 1990, {{it was basically}} a roofless MJ1 with a 3.5-litre Rover V8 engine. It had a very light aluminium monocoque chassis, Triumph Vitesse front suspension, a five-speed Heron/Škoda gearbox, and unequal length <b>wishbones</b> on the <b>rear.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Renault Express gave it {{both as a}} {{panel van}} with two sides {{battered}} double doors in the rear, as well as having a large, upward-opening tailgate. As with its predecessors Renault 4 F4 and F6 all wheels were the Renault Express individually suspended: the front of MacPherson struts and <b>wishbones</b> and <b>rear</b> to swing with torsion bars, while similar vehicles - such as the VW Caddy or Opel Combo etc. - Often with a rear live axle were fitted to leaf springs.|$|R
50|$|The GT uses a front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, {{with the}} engine inside the vehicle's wheelbase.The {{spaceframe}} chassis and body are made out of aluminium alloys, while the boot lid is steel and the engine bonnet magnesium.The suspensions are double <b>wishbones</b> front and <b>rear,</b> with forged aluminium wishbones and hub carriers.|$|R

5000|$|In 1974 the {{mid-engined}} Lancia Stratos, {{the first}} car designed specifically for rally racing, was operational and homologated. At {{the same time it}} was obvious that the rear-engined A110 was nearing the limits of its development potential. The adoption of fuel injection brought no performance increase. On some cars, a DOHC 16-valve head was fitted to the engine, but it proved unreliable. Chassis modification, like the use of an A310 double <b>wishbone</b> <b>rear</b> suspension, homologated with the A110 1600SC, also failed to increase performance. On the international stage the Stratos proved to be the [...] "ultimate weapon", making the A110, as well as many other rally cars, soon obsolete. The A110 is still seen in events such as Rallye Monte-Carlo Historique.|$|E
5000|$|Toyota debuted the {{production}} tC at the January 2004 NAIAS with sales beginning in June 2004 as a 2005 model year. The Scion tC {{is a spiritual}} successor to the Toyota Celica in order {{to appeal to the}} Millennial market. Toyota hoped to do so by making standard features numerous and optional features extremely easy to add as well as giving the car a sporty flair. The Scion tC shares its chassis with the Avensis and uses a MacPherson strut front and double <b>wishbone</b> <b>rear</b> suspension. Its low price (base MSRP of US$17,670 for the 2009 model with manual transmission) is a major feature, as well as the pure [...] "monospec" [...] pricing marketing style that Toyota has adopted. This generation was not sold in Canada.|$|E
50|$|During 1960 Tony Rudd {{designed}} his Mark II {{version of}} the car, with a conventional 2 disc rear brake layout, simple <b>rear</b> <b>wishbone</b> suspension and a much lower profile. This resulted {{in a much better}} handling car, and for the 1961 Formula One season BRM based their chassis designs on the Mark II.|$|R
50|$|The 1094cc {{engine block}} {{is the same}} as used in the Mitsubishi Colt, {{developing}} 80 hp at 6500 rpm and giving the vehicle a top speed of 135 km/h. The steering is a traditional rack and pinion setup, with power assistance. The front suspension is double <b>wishbone,</b> and the <b>rear</b> is helical spring.|$|R
25|$|Like its predecessor, the Testarossa used double <b>wishbone</b> {{front and}} <b>rear</b> {{suspension}} systems. Ferrari improved traction by adding 10-inch-wide alloy rear wheels. The Testarossa drivetrain {{was also an}} evolution of the BB 512i. Its engine used near identical displacement and compression ratio, but unlike the BB 512i had four-valve cylinder heads that were finished in red.|$|R
50|$|In December 2007, Subaru began {{testing the}} WRC2008, {{based on the}} all new GE chassis Impreza WRX. The 2008 car is {{expected}} to benefit from a decreased {{polar moment of inertia}} due to smaller overhangs, and also features a double <b>wishbone</b> <b>rear</b> suspension. However, Prodrive found this setup inferior, and converted the rear suspension back to the original MacPherson design. However, an updated 2007 car will be used for the first few rallies, with the 2008 car introduced after that. Markko Märtin signed a deal to become the official test driver for the Subaru team in 2008, and has thus far done the majority of the testing on the WRC2008.During a 4-day test at Sardinia between 30 April and 3 May 2008, Petter Solberg and Chris Atkinson drove the WRC2008 for the first time. A date for its debut was still not given.On 20 May 2008, the Subaru World Rally Team confirmed its new Impreza World Rally Car (WRC2008) will make its WRC debut at the Acropolis Rally of Greece, beginning on the 29th of May. On the cars rally debut, the WRC2008 scored its first podium finish with Petter Solberg placing 2nd in the Acropolis Rally.|$|E

5000|$|Tamiya has marketed several {{updated version}} of the Blackfoot. The Super Blackfoot {{was based on the}} same basic space frame chassis, with the most {{important}} improvements being a better gearbox and double <b>wishbone</b> <b>rear</b> suspension with dogbone driveshafts instead of the original's vulnerable and quickly wearing ORV-type gearbox, trailing arm suspension and hex type drive shafts and sockets. The body was basically {{the same as that of}} the Blackfoot, but with a different grill design and new decals. Later, the Super Blackfoot was replaced by the King Blackfoot, this time with an improved front suspension with longer suspension arms. The styrene body for the King Blackfoot was still clearly derived from a Ford design, but no longer identified as being a Ford by Tamiya and a totally new development. Tamiya currently (2005) markets a completely updated model called the [...] "Blackfoot Xtreme." [...] The [...] "Xtreme" [...] has a totally different chassis design than previous versions, but retains the body of the King Blackfoot, just mildly modified with a hood scoop, a modernized grill and new decals. The BX is the final incarnation of the Blackfoot name. The [...] "Xtreme" [...] can even be modified for 4WD with the addition of a front gearbox and a second motor. As a matter of fact, Tamiya markets the 4WD [...] "Wild Dagger", 4WD [...] "Twin Detonator", and the 4WD [...] "Double Blaze" [...] all based on the same basic chassis as the [...] "Xtreme".|$|E
50|$|The Maserati Coupé and Spyder {{both have}} a light alloy double <b>wishbone</b> {{suspension}}. The <b>rear</b> suspension is fitted with a toe-in regulator bar which enhances the precision of the drive train and provides balanced cornering. The front suspension layout incorporates “anti-dive” features to prevent nose-diving when braking. The suspension system is completed by front and rear anti-roll bars.|$|R
50|$|Haynes Roadster is a {{follow-up}} to the Locost design described in a book by Ron Champion. Locost uses Ford Escort Mark II as a donor, but as these have become increasingly rare, a design based on a more affordable Ford Sierra has been proposed. In contrast to Locost, which used Escort's solid axle at the rear, Haynes Roadster has independent, double <b>wishbone,</b> front and <b>rear</b> suspension.|$|R
50|$|AWD Diamantes come {{in three}} models: the 25V 4WD, 30R 4WD and the {{flagship}} 30R-SE 4WD. All have MacPherson {{strut front suspension}} with double <b>wishbones</b> at the <b>rear.</b> Both front and rear brake discs are ventilated. The AWD Diamante sits 5 mm lower than a standard FWD Diamante and has a 70-liter fuel tank instead of the FWD's 72-liter tank. All are available only as four-speed automatic.|$|R
50|$|The car was {{modified}} and {{entered in the}} 1972 Austrian Grand Prix. Migault qualified {{at the end of}} the field despite some engine troubles. After 22 laps, Migault had passed four competitors, but a <b>rear</b> <b>wishbone</b> mounting point failed and Migault had a nasty moment. The car swerved towards the barriers on the start/finish straight, but the driver brought the car safely to a halt without damage.|$|R
50|$|When first {{shown on}} Sardinia {{and at the}} Paris Auto Show in 1967, the 1100 was {{advanced}} in design, featuring a hatchback with folding rear seats, disc brakes, rack and pinion steering, an independent front (double <b>wishbone)</b> and <b>rear</b> (trailing arm) suspension using torsion bars. Numerous permutations were available, with a manual, automatic and semi-automatic transmission. The engine was slanted {{to allow for a}} lower bonnet; and the engine, gearbox, and suspension were carried on a subframe to allow the unibody to be relatively unstressed. The body was welded to the frame, not bolted. The 1100 was reportedly studied closely by Volkswagen when the latter company was designing its Volkswagen Golf, after making rear-engined, rear-wheel-drive vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Despite being {{a modest}} car, the Civic is popular as a {{platform}} for modification and customization by the enthusiast community. Starting with the fourth generation and continuing through the 2000 model year, Civics had front double <b>wishbone</b> suspension and <b>rear</b> semi-trailing arm suspension. Ready parts interchangeability allows easy engine swaps (primarily with more powerful B16A (Civic SI), B18C (Acura Integra GSR), and various K20 Civic motors) and many other upgrades.|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} {{is called}} as AlfaLink, double <b>wishbone</b> front, multi-link <b>rear</b> aluminium suspension. Springs are {{longer than the}} Giulia, but stiffer to counteract the extra height. Driver sit 190 mm further up from the road than in Giulia. The Alfa Q4 all-wheel drive system (rear drive in normal conditions, up to 50 per cent of the power frontwards in low-grip conditions) is standard on all versions except an entry-level turbo petrol version.|$|R
25|$|The {{suspension}} of the DMC-12 is a four-wheel independent suspension, coil springs, and telescopic shock absorbers. The front suspension uses double <b>wishbones,</b> while the <b>rear</b> is a multi-link setup. In its original development stages, the car {{is said to have}} handled quite well. Design drawings clearly show that the design met NHTSA minimum bumper and headlight heights of the time. Many owners have subsequently replaced or modified the front springs to return the front height to the original design specification.|$|R
50|$|The Atomota {{replaced}} the Atom in 1957 {{and was a}} complete re-design with front-mounted engine and new chassis. The engine was a twin cylinder, 646 cc BSA overhead-valve unit from the BSA Golden Flash model. It was coupled to a Standard 10 gearbox and drove the rear wheels via a propeller shaft and hypoid bevel gear. The suspension used coil springs all round with trailing <b>wishbones</b> at the <b>rear.</b> The number made is uncertain and the last car {{seems to have been}} made in 1960.|$|R
