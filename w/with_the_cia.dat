The Pakistani government denied {{that it had}} sheltered bin Laden, and said it had shared information <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> and other intelligence agencies about the compound since 2009.

5|$|A {{few days}} after his last meeting <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> he led an assault against Matamoros along {{with a handful of}} supporters. The attack failed, and Castillo Armas was wounded and arrested. A year later, he bribed his way out of prison, and escaped back to Honduras. The {{engineer}} dispatched by the CIA to liaise with Castillo Armas informed them that Castillo Armas had the financial backing of Somoza and Trujillo. US President Harry S. Truman thereupon authorized Operation PBFORTUNE. Castillo Armas's stories of his revolt and escape from prison proved popular among the right-wing exiles in Honduras. Among these people, Castillo Armas claimed to still have support among the army, and began planning another revolt. His reputation was inflated by stories that he had escaped from prison through a tunnel.|$|E
