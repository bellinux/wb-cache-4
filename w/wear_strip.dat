5000|$|After {{reaching}} takeoff speed, the tyre of {{the number}} 2 wheel was cut by a metal strip (a <b>wear</b> <b>strip)</b> lying on the runway, which had fallen from the thrust reverser cowl door {{of the number}} 3 engine of a Continental Airlines DC-10 that had taken off from the same runway five minutes previously. This <b>wear</b> <b>strip</b> had been replaced at Tel Aviv, Israel, during a C check on 11 June 2000, and then again at Houston, Texas, on 9 July 2000. The strip installed in Houston had been neither manufactured nor installed {{in accordance with the}} procedures as defined by the manufacturer.|$|E
50|$|Five {{minutes before}} the Concorde departed, a Continental Airlines DC-10 heading for Newark, New Jersey took off from the same runway and lost a {{titanium}} alloy strip (part of the engine cowl, identified as a <b>wear</b> <b>strip)</b> that was about 435 mm long, 29 to 34 mm wide and 1.4 mm thick.|$|E
5000|$|The railway {{consisted}} {{of a series of}} piles driven into the ground connected by 12" [...] square timbers upon which set a single rail.

Road crossings operated like a fence gate, as did switches.|$|E

5000|$|In March 2008, Bernard Farret, {{a deputy}} {{prosecutor}} in Pontoise, outside Paris, asked judges to bring manslaughter charges against Continental Airlines {{and two of}} its employees - John Taylor, the mechanic who replaced the <b>wear</b> <b>strip</b> on the DC-10, and his manager Stanley Ford - alleging negligence {{in the way the}} repair was carried out. Continental denied the charges, and claimed in court that it was being used as a scapegoat by the BEA. The airline suggested that the Concorde [...] "was already on fire when its wheels hit the titanium strip, and that around 20 first-hand witnesses had confirmed that the plane seemed to be on fire immediately after it began its take-off roll".|$|E
30|$|Shape control models include {{mechanism}} and intelligent models {{in terms of}} research methods. With regard to physical principles, shape control models consist of strip plastic deformation, rolls elastic deformation, strip and roll temperature field, rolls <b>wear,</b> <b>strip</b> buckling, shape pattern recognition, shape standard curve, and shape feedback control model [1]. Researches on shape control models have achieved remarkable progress in the past 10 years.|$|E
40|$|Background: Mechanical {{failure of}} femoral stems at the modular {{junction}} of revision hip arthroplasty systems {{has been reported}} only infrequently. In the current study, the cause of six stem fractures, which occurred in vivo, was analyzed with use of clinical data and failure analysis. Methods: Six patients with a fracture at the mid-stem junction of a modular revision hip implant were identified in our database of patients who had undergone revision arthroplasty. The characteristics of the patients with a fractured stem were {{compared with those of}} 165 patients from the same prospective database who had a modular stem implanted, had at least two years of follow-up, and had not had a fracture of the stem. Failure analysis of three implants (six fracture surfaces) was carried out, with use of microscopic, chemical, and microhardness characterization techniques. Results: Patients with a fractured stem had significantly higher body mass indices than patients without a stem fracture. Radiographs demonstrated that these femoral implants lacked adequate osseous support of the junction area of the stem. All stems failed approximately 1 to 2 mm proximal to the body-stem junction, thus indicating the presence of a bending moment. The chemical composition andmicrohardness matched those of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. Evidence of wear and fatigue were found on the fracture surface. A <b>wear</b> <b>strip</b> was also observed along the circumference of the stem near the junction. Conclusions: We concluded that the stem failure was initiated by a fretting fatigue mechanism and was propagated by a pure bending fatigue mechanism. Risk factors for fractures of the modular junction include excessive body weight an...|$|E
