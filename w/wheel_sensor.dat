50|$|The sport {{differential}} operates {{by using}} two superposition ("step up") gears at the differential, which are operated via multi-plate clutches {{each side of}} the differential crown wheel. When required by the software (using lateral and longitudinal yaw sensors, the ABS wheel sensors, and a steering <b>wheel</b> <b>sensor),</b> the control software (located in a control unit close to the rear differential), actuates the relevant clutch pack. This has the effect of taking the output shaft drive through the step-up gear to the attached wheel, while the other shaft continues to drive its wheel directly (i.e., the clutch pack not actuated). The higher speed output shaft produces increased torque to the wheel, producing a yaw (turning) moment. In normal operation increased torque is delivered to the wheel {{on the outside of the}} turn thereby increasing the vehicles turning moment, in other words, its willingness to turn in the direction pointed by the steering wheel.|$|E

This contribution describes algorithms, used to ensure – along with others – the overall safety of the system (i. e. preventing hazardous behavior). A kinematic constraint, modelled as a dynamic system, is used to estimate the steering wheel angle. This estimated signal is compared with the measured signal. Using change detection algorithms typical failure patterns of the steering <b>wheel</b> <b>sensor</b> are detected quite easily.

40|$|A {{depth control}} {{system based on}} the three point hitch of an {{agricultural}} tractor and a <b>wheel</b> <b>sensor</b> was developed for real time soil compaction measurements, aiming to develop compaction maps with uniform soil depths. To measure the distance variation between the soil surface and {{the frame of the}} compaction sensor system a pendulum-type metal-wheel sensor with a linear displacement transducer was designed. An analytical-statistical hybrid model was developed for the direct calculation of the frame height variation utilising the sensor output in volt. Results of various measurements performed on asphalt road, soil road and agricultural silty clay loam soil were compared with ultrasonic measurements to validate the sensor, resulting in standard deviations of 0 • 0035 m, 0 • 0051 m and 0 • 0080 m respectively. The relatively big weight of 175 N made the <b>wheel</b> <b>sensor</b> less sensitive to height variations compared to the ultrasonic sensor when passing directly above plant stubble. Therefore, the <b>wheel</b> <b>sensor</b> can be properly used in fields covered with plant residue and stubble, where the ultrasonic sensor provides misleading measurement of distance from the soil surface. A semi-analytical model was developed for the conversion of the voltage applied to the hydraulic system of the thee point hitch of a New Holland 8160 agricultural tractor to the depth under the soil surface of the cutting tool. The model consists of two distinct submodels: a model for the agricultural tractor based on a kinematic and dynamic analysis of the tractor in the xy-plane and a model for the hydraulic system with a theoretical model structure, for which the parameters have been determined by means of black box frequency domain identification techniques. Both submodels have been coupled and succesfully validated by comparing experimental results with those predicted by the model. It was concluded that the tractor dynamics were not excited by the activity of the hydraulic subsystem. Therefore, a reduced model consisting of the hydraulic system model multiplied by a conversion factor was used for controller design. Based on the dynamic model of the system, several controllers were designed with the root locus technique. A PID controller with a first order low pass filter on the D-action provided the best results in field conditions, reducing the depth variation range from 0. 012 m to 0. 002 m. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: There {{has been}} an {{increase}} in the use of composite materials in the aerospace industry which is driving a need for new NDT techniques that can rapidly scan large structures and provide quantitative data on the material integrity. In many applications there are common requirements for the ultrasonic inspection of composites for porosity, delaminations, foreign body contamination and fibre wrinkling. Traditional methods of ultrasonic inspection require the use of a single point probe or a multiplexed group of probes. NDT Solutions have developed new inspection techniques based on ultrasonic arrays housed within a rubber coupled <b>wheel</b> <b>sensor.</b> The wheel can be manually applied or scanned over the structure with an automated scanning system. Applications for the technology include real time imaging and reporting of impact damage, porosity sizing, delaminations and fibre wrinkles.

40|$|Department of Human Factors EngineeringDriving is {{a commonplace}} but safety {{critical}} daily activity {{for billions of}} people. It {{remains one of the}} leading causes of death worldwide, particularly in younger adults. In the last decades, a wide range of technologies, such as intelligent braking or speed regulating systems, have been integrated into vehicles to improve safetyannually decreasing death rates testify to their success. A recent research focus in this area has been in the development of systems that sense human states or activities during driving. This is valuable because human error remains a key reason underlying many vehicle accidents and incidents. Technologies that can intervene in response to information sensed about a driver may be able to detect, predict and ultimately prevent problems before they progress into accidents, thus avoiding the occurrence of critical situations rather than just mitigating their consequences. Commercial examples of this kind of technology include systems that monitor driver alertness or lane holding and prompt drivers who are sleepy or drifting off-lane. More exploratory research in this area has sought to capture emotional state or stress/workload levels via physiological measurements of Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Electroencephalogram (EEG), or behavioral measurements of eye gaze or face pose. Other research has monitored explicitly user actions, such as head pose or foot movements to infer intended actions (such as overtaking or lane change) and provide automatic assessments of the safety of these future behaviors – for example, providing a timely warning to a driver who is planning to overtake about a vehicle in his or her blind spot. Researchers have also explored how sensing hands on the wheel can be used to infer a driver’s presence, identity or emotional state. This thesis extends this body of work through the design, development and evaluation of a steering <b>wheel</b> <b>sensor</b> platform that can directly detect a driver’s hand pose all around a steering wheel. This thesis argues that full steering hand pose is a potentially rich source of information about a driver’s intended actions. For example, it proposes a link between hand posture on the wheel and subsequent turning or lane change behavior. To explore this idea, this thesis describes the construction of a touch sensor {{in the form of a}} steering wheel cover. This cover integrates 32 equidistantly spread touch sensing electrodes (11. 250 inter-sensor spacing) in the form of conductive ribbons (0. 2 " wide and 0. 03 " thick). Data from each ribbons is captured separately via a set of capacitive touch sensor microcontrollers every 64 ms. We connected this hardware platform to an OpenDS, an open source driving simulator and ran two studies capturing hand pose during a sequential lane change task and a slalom task. We analyzed the data to determine whether hand pose is a useful predictor of future turning behavior. For this we classified a 5 -lane road into 4 turn sizes and used machine-learning recognizers to predict the future turn size from the change in hand posture in terms of hand movement properties from the early driving data. Driving task scenario of the first experiment was not appropriately matched with the real life turning task therefore we modified the scenario with more appropriate task in the second experiments. Class-wise prediction of the turn sizes for both experiments didn’t show good accuracy, however prediction accuracy was improved when the classes were reduced into two classes from four classes. In the experiment 2 turn sizes were overlapped between themselves, which made it very difficult to distinguish them. Therefore, we did continuous prediction as well and the prediction accuracy was better than the class-wise prediction system for the both experiments. In summary, this thesis designed, developed and evaluated a combined hardware and software system that senses the steering behavior of a driver by capturing grip pose. We assessed the value of this information via two studies that explored the relationship between wheel grip and future turning behaviors. The ultimate outcome of this study can inform the development of in car sensing systems to support safer driving. clos...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a prototype energy harvesting autonomous sensor, called the Autonomous <b>Wheel</b> Speed <b>Sensor</b> (AWSS), that is targeted for {{operation in the}} Electronic Braking System (EBS) of vehicles. In order to monitor the rotational state of a wheel, the EBS currently uses a passive <b>Wheel</b> Speed <b>Sensor</b> (WSS) which is a variable reluctance electromagnetic transducer. In the existing EBS setup, one WSS is used per wheel, {{each of which is}} connected to the EBS system using extensive cabling. This project presents the first successful attempt at converting the WSS into an energy harvesting wireless <b>wheel</b> speed <b>sensor</b> or in other words an Autonomous <b>Wheel</b> Speed <b>Sensor</b> (AWSS), which provides information about the rotational state of the wheel to the EBS system over a wireless link. Unlike most wireless sensors which use batteries, the AWSS employs energy harvesting to power itself by simultaneously using the WSS electromagnetic transducer as an energy harvester as well as a sensor. By thus making an autonomous WSS, the amount of cables in the existing WSS assembly can be reduced, leading to savings in material, assembly and maintenance costs. The self-powered prototype AWSS successfully implements periodic wireless transmission of the wheel speed along with near real-time wheel lock detection, at a duty cycle of less than Th...|$|R
