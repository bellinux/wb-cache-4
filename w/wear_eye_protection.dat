50|$|Whether indoors or outdoors, all {{shooters}} {{are typically}} required to <b>wear</b> <b>eye</b> <b>protection</b> {{as well as}} hearing protection (ear muffs or ear plugs) at all times when within the defined boundaries of the range. Depending on the range, prescription eyeglasses may qualify as eye protection. Indoor ranges can be particularly unsafe, due to high lead exposures and increased noise exposures where the design or management is not of a quality conducive to best practice.|$|E
5000|$|As it is {{associated}} with excessive sun [...] or wind exposure, wearing protective sunglasses with side shields and/or wide brimmed hats and using artificial tears throughout the day may help prevent their formation or stop further growth.

50|$|Eye-gouging is {{prohibited}} in modern sports. It {{is a serious}} offence in rugby football codes where it occurs rarely. It {{is prohibited}} in combat sports, but some self-defense systems teach it. Training in eye-gouging can involve extensive grappling training to establish control, the eye-gouging itself being practiced with the opponent <b>wearing</b> <b>eye</b> <b>protection</b> such as swimming goggles. Yuki Nakai {{went on to win}} a bout in the Vale Tudo Japan 1995 tournament after his opponent performed an illegal gouge that blinded him in his right eye.|$|R
50|$|The injury may be {{prevented}} by <b>wearing</b> <b>eye</b> <b>protection</b> that blocks {{most of the}} ultraviolet radiation, such as welding goggles with the proper filters, a welder's helmet, sunglasses rated for sufficient UV protection, or appropriate snow goggles. The condition is usually managed by removal from the source of ultraviolet radiation, covering the corneas, and administration of pain relief. Photokeratitis is known {{by a number of}} different terms including: snow blindness, arc eye, welder's flash, bake eyes, corneal flash burns, sand man's eye, flash burns, niphablepsia, potato eye, or keratoconjunctivitis photoelectrica.|$|R

50|$|Women's {{lacrosse}} {{rules are}} specifically designed to limit physical contact between players. As {{a result of the}} lack of contact, the only protective equipment required are a mouth guard and face guard/goggles. Although headgear is not required except for Florida where its mandatory for girls lacrosse players to wear a head gear it is considered to new lacrosse players due to the risk of head injury. This caused by the round rubber ball used in the sport. Players must <b>wear</b> <b>eye</b> <b>protection</b> according to US Lacrosse rules. All field players must properly <b>wear</b> <b>eye</b> <b>protection</b> that meets ASTM specification standard F803 for women's adult/ youth lacrosse for the appropriate level of play. All players must wear a professionally manufactured intra-oral mouthpiece that fully covers the teeth. The mouthguard must include portions protecting and separating the biting surfaces and protecting the teeth and supporting structures and has to cover he posterior teeth with adequate thickness. No protruding tabs are allowed for field players. In addition, players may choose to wear gloves, and jewelry is not allowed to be worn. Although the rules specify these types of protection, injuries still occur from accidental checks to the head and the overall nature of the sport. Players must wear composition or rubber soled shoes. No spikes are allowed. Plastic, leather, or rubber cleats-studs may be worn. Shoes and socks are not required to be identical for team members. The pockets of women's sticks are shallower than those of the men, making the ball more difficult to catch and to shoot at high speed. The pockets also make it harder to cradle without dropping the ball. The crosse of a women's stick may be 35.5 inches and no longer than 43.25 according to the NCAA girls lacrosse committee.|$|E
50|$|Prevention of ocular {{trauma is}} most {{effective}} when soldiers wear polycarbonate eye armor correctly in the battlefield. For Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, the United States Military have made Ballistic Laser Protective Spectacles (BLPS), Special Protective Eyewear Cylindrical System (SPECS), and Sun/Wind/Dust Goggles (SWDG) available to combatants and associated personnel. These forms of eye protection are available in non-prescription and prescription lenses, and their use has been made mandatory at all times when soldiers are in areas of potential conflict. Despite their proven record of protection against secondary blast trauma, soldier compliance remains low: 85% of soldiers afflicted ocular trauma {{in the first year}} of OEF were not wearing their protective lenses at the time of detonation. While 41% of soldiers could not recall whether or not they were wearing eye protection at the time of detonation, 17% of casualties were wearing eye protection while 26% of casualties were not. Among this group, the poorest visual prognoses were documented in individuals who did not <b>wear</b> <b>eye</b> <b>protection.</b> The lack of compliance has been attributed to complaints about comfort, stylishness, and “misting” of the lenses when in the field. BLPS and SPECS offer the same line of protection against secondary trauma as the SWD goggles, and these lenses may overcome the complaints many soldiers have with their military-issue goggles.|$|E
5000|$|Team Challenge: The Gazebo: Jake and Nicole {{are given}} the job of leading the contestants through the task of {{building}} a prefabricated gazebo, along with making a picnic table from scratch, and building a barbecue out of an old oil drum. Jake assigns Fabian and Jesse to build the picnic table which, despite getting very little direction from Jake, they complete without any trouble. The barbecue is mostly handled by Steve, who also manages to finish it without any trouble, though considers Jake's leadership {{to be more than}} a little nitpicky. Nicole leads the remaining contestants in assembling the gazebo, and quickly gets very flustered and snappy, causing the build to progress slowly. Things speed up once the remaining contestants join them, despite Nicole continuing to maintain a negative attitude. However, after having already witnessed several safety violations (including Jesse and Fabian both needing to be reminded to <b>wear</b> <b>eye</b> <b>protection,</b> and Jake's unsafe use of the angle grinder), Rob drags everyone aside to reprimand them for failing to wear the safety gloves that they were specifically instructed to use. He warns them of dire consequences should he see any more safety violations, but minutes later Fabian is caught without his gloves on a critical part of the build. An infuriated Rob immediately shuts the build down and declares the project a failure; consequently, no team is named the best for this task, and no-one gets an advantage for the next challenge.|$|E

40|$|Full-contact {{martial arts}} *Javelin and discus {{have a small}} but {{definite}} potential for injury. However, good field supervision can reduce the extremely low risk injury to near- negligible. EVALUATION All athletes and their parents should {{be made aware of}} the risks associated with participation in sports and the availability of a variety of certified sports eye protectors. Although eye protectors cannot eliminate the risk of injury, appropriate eye protectors have been found {{to reduce the risk of}} significant eye injury by at least 90 % when properly fitted. 4, 6, 7 It would be ideal if all children and adolescents <b>wore</b> appropriate <b>eye</b> <b>protection</b> for all eye-risk sports and recreational activities. Physicians should strongly recommend that athletes who are functionally one-eyed <b>wear</b> appropriate <b>eye</b> <b>protection</b> during all sports, recreational, and work-related activities. Functionally one-eyed athletes are those who have a best corrected visual acuity of worse than 20 / 40 in the poorer-seeing eye. 1, 4, 8 If the better eye is injured, functionally one-eyed athletes may be severely handicapped and unable to obtain a driver's licens...|$|R
50|$|The game {{is played}} by 2 players, on a {{rectangular}} table with a centre board screen, and goal pockets on either short sides. The objective {{of the game is}} to bat the ball across the table, under the centreboard screen, into the opponent's goal, while the opponent tries to prevent this from happening. The players have to <b>wear</b> <b>eye</b> <b>protection,</b> to ensure that they won't {{be able to see the}} ball. Play is always initiated with a serve. To serve correctly, players must hit the ball so that it bounces off the side wall of the table exactly once, before passing under the centre screen. If not performed correctly, 1 point will be awarded to the opponent. Each player serves two times in a row. A player scores two points for a goal and one point when their opponent hits the ball into the screen, hits the ball off the table, touches the ball with the bat or the batting hand within the goal area, touches the ball with anything but the bat, or traps or stops the ball for more than 2 seconds, making the ball inaudible for the opponent. One point is also awarded to the opponent if a player touches his or her eye protection without first asking permission. Matches are usually played in 3 sets, best of 2 wins. The first player to reach 11 points, leading by 2 or more points wins the set. The exceptions are semifinals, and finals where best of 3 sets wins. Players will change sides after each set in match play. In the last set of the match the players will switch sides after 6 points are scored by 1 player or after half of stop time has expired. Spectators must be quiet during play, so as not to interfere with the players ability to hear the ball. Cheering is however allowed After the referee has whistled.|$|E
40|$|The milky sap or latex of Euphorbia {{plant is}} highly toxic and an {{irritant}} {{to the skin}} and eye. This report illustrates the spectrum of ocular inflammation caused by accidental inoculation of latex of Euphorbia plant. Three patients presented with accidental ocular exposure to the milky sap of Euphorbia species of recent onset. The initial symptoms in all cases were severe burning sensation with blurring of vision. Visual acuity reduced from 20 / 60 to counting fingers. Clinical findings varied from kerato-conjunctivitis, mild to severe corneal edema, epithelial defects, anterior uveitis and secondary elevated intraocular pressure. All symptoms and signs had resolved by 10 - 14 days with active supportive medication. People who handle Euphorbia plants should <b>wear</b> <b>eye</b> <b>protection.</b> It is always advisable to ask the patient to bring {{a sample of the}} plant for identification...|$|E

40|$|AIMS: To report {{four cases}} of Euphorbia sap causing {{anterior}} segment toxicity. METHODS: Medical records of four patients who presented with Euphorbia sap keratoconjunctivitis were reviewed. Clinical findings {{were compared with}} previously published reports. RESULTS: All of these patients experienced a similar clinical course. Initial contact with Euphorbia sap caused punctate epitheliopathy; patients noted immediate burning and photophobia, but no visual loss. In all cases, patients experienced epithelial slough with delayed healing, requiring approximately 9 days to heal the epithelial defect. Patients were treated with topical antibiotics, pressure patching or a bandage contact lens, and final visual acuities were excellent in all cases. A {{review of the literature}} revealed that Euphorbia sap contains a diterpenoid diester which exhibits antineoplastic activity in rodents. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals who work with Euphorbia plants should be cautioned to <b>wear</b> <b>eye</b> <b>protection.</b> Patients with Euphorbia sap anterior segment toxicity should be informed that their condition may worsen initially, but that visual outcome is generally excellent. The progressive corneal epithelial sloughing and delayed corneal epithelial healing may be secondary to the antineoplastic effects of Euphorbia sap...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine how much progress U. S. dental schools have made in providing eye protec-tion during restorative (adult operative and fixed prosthodontic) procedures since a 1979 survey. A seven-question survey was placed at a website, and fifty-five different U. S. dental schools were asked to complete the survey. Thirty-one schools responded (56 percent). Eighty-four percent of schools had safety glasses available for patients, but only 77 percent required usage during restorative procedures. Similarly, while 87 percent of schools required dental students working in restorative clinics to wear safety glasses, just 73 percent enforced the policy. Additionally, 84 percent provided blue light protection on curing lights and required students to <b>wear</b> <b>eye</b> <b>protection</b> while doing lab procedures. Compared to the 1979 survey, considerable progress has been made over the last twenty-seven years in protecting dental school patients and students from ocular injuries. Because one would hope to have 100 percent compliance on this issue, there is room for improvement in promoting patient eye safety and teaching good habits to dental students...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} on a sample of 1552 firefighting personnel to determine the incidence of eye injuries within the United Kingdom fire service. In total, 3. 5 % (n = 22 / 637) of firefighters per year will sustain an eye injury requiring 'medical attention'. This represents one ocular injury per 50, 000 working hours. In 80 % of cases eye protection was not being worn {{at the time of}} injury. Analysis of 75 accident report forms indicates that the vast majority (69 / 75) of eye injuries were sustained whilst on operational duty. These statistics are comparable to other professions which are considered to have an unacceptably high risk of injury and in which eye protection has therefore been actively enforced. It would follow that similar steps should be taken within the fire service to ensure firefighters <b>wear</b> <b>eye</b> <b>protection</b> on operational duty. This should apply even if there is no immediate recognition of a perceived danger. A firefighter presenting to an optometrist or medical practitioner, with or without an eye injury, should be counselled as to the advantages of eye protection...|$|E
