40|$|Les résidus de {{transformation}} du bois tels les écorces et la sciure de bois ont été largement étudiés depuis quelques années pour leur propriété d'adsorption et d'enlèvement des métaux toxiques contenus dans les effluents contaminés. En ce qui concerne la sciure de bois, les recherches répertoriées ont porté principalement sur l'utilisation du sapin rouge, du manga, du tilleul, de l'épinette, du pin, du cèdre, du teck, de l'akamatsu et du buna. Pour ce qui est des écorces de bois, plusieurs espèces ont été étudiées, notamment les écorces de pin, de chêne et d'épinette. La présente revue fait le point sur les performances de ces différents adsorbants peu coûteux pour l'adsorption des principaux métaux contaminants (Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb et Zn). Les points discutés portent sur les méthodes de préparation (lavage, séchage et tamisage) et de traitement chimique de l'adsorbant (traitement acide ou basique, traitement à la formaldéhyde, phosphatation, carboxylation, sulfoéthylation, carboxyméthylation, etc.), les conditions opératoires utilisées lors de l'adsorption, les modèles thermodynamiques, cinétiques et autres applicables au couple adsorbant-adsorbat, l'effet des principaux paramètres opératoires (temps de contact, pH de traitement, température, concentration d'adsorbant, taille des particules, etc.), les principes et les mécanismes impliqués dans l'élimination des contaminants métalliques par les adsorbants présentés. Wood industry by-products such as barks and sawdusts {{have been}} widely studied in recent years for their property of metal adsorption and metal removal from contaminated effluents. Concerning the utilization of sawdusts, many researchers have studied metal adsorption on material from species such as red fir, mango, lime, pine, cedar, teak, Japanese red pine and Japanese beech. As regards wood barks, several species were studied, in particular pine, oak and spruce. The present review gives a progress report on the efficiency of these various inexpensive materials for the adsorption of different metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn). The points discussed relate to the preparation methods (washing, drying, screening) and the chemical treatments of the adsorbents (acid or base treatment, formaldehyde treatment, phosphatation, carboxylation, sulfoethylation, carboxymethylation, etc.). We also consider the operating conditions used during adsorption, the thermodynamic, kinetic and other models applicable to the adsorbent-adsorbate couple, {{the effect of the}} operational parameters (time of contact, pH, temperature, adsorbent concentration, particle size, etc.), as well as the principles and mechanisms involved in metal removal by the adsorbents. The accumulation of organic or inorganic matter at the solid-liquid interface is the basis of almost all surface reactions. Adsorption is often a process described in terms of isotherms, which represent the relationship between the concentration of a solute in solution and the quantity adsorbed at the surface at constant temperature. The isotherms are often used to establish the maximum adsorption capacity of a given adsorbent for metals. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms are the most frequently used and their models are presented in this review. Knowledge of adsorption parameters is essential for understanding the adsorption mechanisms involved. Usually, the maximum adsorption capacity for sawdusts and barks is reached after one hour. The pH of the ambient water is a very important parameter because it affects the metal adsorption capacities. For most of the metals studied, the adsorption capacity increases when the pH increases. The opposite effect is observed for metals involved in an anionic complex (Cr, Se, Pt, Au). Metal adsorption efficiency also improves with increases in substrate concentration because there are more available adsorption sites. Metal adsorption is affected by an another important factor, the particle size. In effect, a smaller size particle increases the specific surface and improves the adsorption capacity. The presence of anions in the effluent doesn't appear to have a great effect on adsorption results with sawdusts. However, some anions were reported to have an influence on the metal adsorption capacities of barks. In the case of a metal mixture, the presence of one metal may influence, compete or exclude the recovery of another metal from the solution. Sawdusts contain lignin, cellulose, tannin and protein. <b>Wood</b> <b>tannin</b> likely serves as a primary adsorption site for divalent cations. The application of chemical treatments on sawdusts could modify the lignin functional groups. Other studies regarding the participation of major components of barks (lignin, carbohydrate and protein) in the adsorption process revealed the involvement of amine and carboxyl functional groups. The proposed mechanism involves an ion-exchange process. This phenomenon suggests that cationic exchange is the active mechanism for some wood species, in agreement with the work of some researchers. Currently, only a few industries use plant biomass to eliminate metals in wastewater. To encourage industries to use this biotechnology, research has to be oriented towards the cheapest and most competitive process rather than the current and conventional process. Forest waste products are produced in large quantities in several countries. They constitute easily-available resources of low cost. Future research in this field should be focused on cheap new chemical treatments to apply to by-products to improve their adsorption capacities...|$|E

The colouring body present in the wastewater from pulp and paper mill is organic in nature and is comprised of <b>wood</b> extractives, <b>tannin,</b> resins, synthetic dyes, lignin and its degradation products formed by the action of chlorine on lignin which imparts an offensive colour to the water. These mills use different chemical process for paper manufacturing due to which lignified chemicals are released into the environment. Therefore, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the emanating stream is quite high. This paper presents some new techniques that were developed for the efficiency of bioremediation on paper industry. A short introduction to paper industry and a variety of presently available methods of bioremediation on paper industry and different strategies are also discussed here. For solving the above problem, two bacterial strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis) and their consorti...|$|R
40|$|Aroeira {{has great}} {{economic}} importance {{due to its}} <b>wood</b> useful, <b>tannins</b> extraction and use in the pharmacology. The aim of this work was to evaluate the germination aspects and initial seedlings development of aroeira, under gibberellins, substrata and shading effects, and for that two experiments were led out. In the first one, seeds were previously soaked for 24 hours in water and in 100 mg. L- 1 gibberellin solution and were sowed directly in cells trays in the following substrata: land and sand (1 : 1 and 1 : 2) and Plantmax. In the second experiment, 15 cm length seedlings were transplanted to polyethylene sacks filled out land+sand+poultry manure (1 : 1 : 1) partly decomposed and they were maintained at greenhouse for 15 days. Soon after, seedlings were transferred for the following conditions: shading (50 %) and full sun and they were 50 mg. L- 1 and 150 mg. L- 1 gibberellins solutions pulverized, as control seedlings water pulverized. Aroeira seeds should not be previously water or gibberellins imbibed before being sowed. The best substrata for aroeira seeds germination was Plantmax without germinative treatments to reach higher than 80 % of seedlings survival. The seedlings developed better at full sun light and the gibberellin. It was observed increment in height, diameter, foliar area and fresh and dry mass from aerial and root part when compared to shading situation. The gibberellins applications did not influence the aroeira seedlings initial growth characteristics...|$|R
30|$|In {{the normal}} use of <b>tannins</b> in <b>wood</b> adhesives, the <b>tannins</b> {{have to be}} {{extracted}} from bark or wood using water as the solvent. However, an attempt {{has been made to}} use tannins directly without extracting them from the bark. This was based on the discovery that a fine particle fraction (<[*] 63  µm) of radiata pine bark contained up to 70 % tannin. Therefore, a technology to use the tannin in the finely ground bark particles without extraction has been developed for the production of wood adhesives [5]. A plywood adhesive has been formulated with bark particles (<[*] 63  µm, 100 parts), paraformaldehyde (10 parts), water (165 parts) and a small amount of aqueous sodium hydroxide to adjust the pH to 8. However, paraformaldehyde is not desired for factory use due to its toxicity {{and the quality of the}} formulations was found to be quite variable. Therefore, formulations producing a better quality of wood adhesives were required.|$|R
40|$|Quebracho <b>tannin</b> <b>wood</b> {{adhesive}} in a nonformaldehyde {{approach has}} a low hardening rate and needs more pressing time than formaldehyde-based wood adhesives during wood composites production. In this study, boric acid (BA) was used to increase autocondensation rate of tannin to make poplar plywood. The main ingredients of the adhesives included quebracho tannin, NaOH, hexamine, BA and polymeric isocyanate (PMDI). Thermomechanical analysis of without BA adhesives showed that maximum modulus of elasticity increased with increasing the initial tannin concentration from 40 % to 50 % (w/w), whereas no significant effect has been found by adding PMDI. Moreover, the addition of BA lowered time and temperature of hardening and increased modulus of elasticity of the adhesive. Also, tensile shear strength increased significantly with increasing the tannin concentration and the BA content (from 2 % to 4 %). Interestingly, applied BA in the glueline not only improved bonding quality of the panels but also provided good preservative performance against fungal attack even after mild leaching test.
