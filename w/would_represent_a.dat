5|$|The Plague of Justinian and the Arab conquests <b>would</b> <b>represent</b> <b>a</b> {{substantial}} {{reversal of}} fortunes {{contributing to a}} period of stagnation and decline.

5|$|Muren {{found both}} stop motion and optical effects {{to be too}} {{technically}} challenging and decided that the transformation scene would be a perfect opportunity for ILM to create advances with digital morphing technology. He proposed filming each animal, and the actress doubling for Hayes, and then feeding the images into a computer program developed by Doug Smythe. The program would then create a smooth transition from one stage to another before outputting the result back onto film. Smythe began development of the necessary software in September 1987. By March 1988, the impressive result Muren and fellow designer David Allen achieved what <b>would</b> <b>represent</b> <b>a</b> breakthrough for computer-generated imagery (CGI). The head of ILM's animation department, Wes Takahashi, supervised the film's animation sequences.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC) was {{initially}} welcomed by Lumumba and the central government who believed the UN would help suppress the secessionist states. ONUC's initial mandate, however, only covered peacekeeping. Viewing the secessions as an internal political matter, Hammarskjöld refused to use UN troops to assist the central Congolese government against them; he argued that doing so <b>would</b> <b>represent</b> <b>a</b> loss of impartiality and breach Congolese sovereignty. Lumumba also sought {{the assistance of the}} United States government of Dwight D. Eisenhower, which refused. Frustrated, he turned to the Soviet Union, which agreed to provide weapons, logistical and material support. Around 1,000 Soviet military advisors soon landed in the Congo. Lumumba's actions distanced him {{from the rest of the}} government, especially Kasa-Vubu, who feared the implications of Soviet intervention. The Americans also feared that a Soviet-aligned Congo could form the basis of a major expansion of communism into central Africa.|$|E

5|$|President of the RSK Milan Babić {{refused to}} endorse the plan; Milošević summoned him to Belgrade where he, Serb members of the federal presidency, JNA commanders and Bosnian Serb leaders tried to persuade Babić {{to change his mind}} in a 70-hour-long meeting. Despite failing to persuade Babić, Milošević {{arranged}} to have the RSK parliament approve the plan instead. Babić's and Milošević's supporters organized two separate, concurrent sessions of the RSK parliamenteach group proclaiming victory. On 27 February, Babić was removed as RSK president following an intervention by Milošević; he was replaced with Goran Hadžić. Babić opposed the Vance plan because he considered that acceptance of it, and the replacement of the JNA by UNPROFOR, <b>would</b> <b>represent</b> <b>a</b> de facto acceptance of Croatian sovereignty over the territory held by the RSK because the Vance plan treated RSK territory as part of Croatia. Croatia considered the UNPAs part of Croatia and objected to any official recognition of RSK officials within them. It feared the RSK would use the UN mission to consolidate itself within the UNPAs. The Croatian authorities considered that the only parties to the Vance Plan were the authorities in Belgrade, the UN and Croatia.|$|E

25|$|Scientists at Chugai Pharmaceuticals {{discovered}} an erythromycin-derived motilin agonist called mitemcinal that {{is believed to}} have strong prokinetic properties (similar to erythromycin) but lacking antibiotic properties.

25|$|Worship of the Holy Spirit was {{promoted}} by Joachim of Fiore, a millenarian prophet who, {{on the basis}} on his interpretation of the Book of Revelation, postulated that 1260 would see {{the beginning of a}} third age.

The third age would be governed by the Holy Spirit and <b>would</b> <b>represent</b> <b>a</b> monastic governance, in which the hierarchy of the Church would be unnecessary and infidels would unite with Christians.

Such a mission could assess the potential value of water, iron, nickel, platinum and other resources on the asteroid; test possible ways to extract them; and possibly examine or develop techniques {{which could be used}} to protect the Earth from asteroid impacts.

25|$|Since {{the demise}} of {{apartheid}} the ruling African National Congress has wanted to replace the Springbok across all national teams, as emblem of the racially segregated sporting codes, with a neutral symbol that <b>would</b> <b>represent</b> <b>a</b> decisive break with a repressive past. The King Protea as South Africa's national flower was chosen for this purpose, so that the national cricket team {{became known as the}} Proteas, for example. A similar change was envisioned for the national rugby squad's springbok emblem. Paul Roos's team had first introduced the Springbok in 1906, and it had promoted a measure of unity among white English and Afrikaans-speaking players after the two Anglo-Boer Wars of the late 19th century.|$|E
25|$|The burning {{sensation}} in muscles during hard exercise {{can be attributed}} to the release of hydrogen ions during the shift to glucose fermentation from glucose oxidation to carbon dioxide and water, when aerobic metabolism can no longer keep pace with the energy demands of the muscles. These hydrogen ions form a part of lactic acid. The body falls back on this less efficient but faster method of producing ATP under low oxygen conditions. This is thought to have been the primary means of energy production in earlier organisms before oxygen reached high concentrations in the atmosphere between 2000 and 2500 million years ago (see diagram above right), and thus <b>would</b> <b>represent</b> <b>a</b> more ancient form of energy production than the aerobic replenishment of NAD+ in cells.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical {{evaluation of the}} economic effects of the Structural Funds received by the Spain’s Objective 1 regions through the Community Support Framework (CSF).

Compared to a scenario without CSFs, the successive investment programmes from 1989 to 2006 <b>would</b> <b>represent</b> <b>an</b> average increase of 0. 56 percentage points in the growth rates of the Spanish recipient regions. This increase would translate to an average increase in per capita income of 425 euros at 1999 prices. In terms of the labour market, the CSF has maintained or generated an increase of 1. 46 per cent in employment compared to an alternative scenario without CSF. This in turn <b>would</b> <b>represent</b> <b>an</b> average reduction of 0. 74 percentage points in the unemployment rate during the aforementioned period. ...|$|R
