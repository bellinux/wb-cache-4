5|$|At {{the time}} of construction, {{artificial}} lakes <b>were</b> <b>typically</b> long and straight. The Serpentine {{was one of the}} earliest artificial lakes designed to appear natural, and was widely imitated in parks and gardens nationwide.|$|E
5|$|Building {{practices}} {{along the}} coast also included boathouses, fishing cottages, piers, etc. Here, houses for livestock and people <b>were</b> <b>typically</b> built up from the actual shoreline. A typical medium-sized farm in the inland of Norway would include a dwelling house (våningshus), hay barn (låve), livestock barn (fjøs), one or more food storage houses (stabbur), a stable, and occasionally separate houses for poultry, pigs, etc. Houses that had separate heat sources, e.g., washing houses (eldhus) and smithies were usually kept separate from the other houses to prevent fires. Outhouses <b>were</b> <b>typically</b> separate, small structures. If the farm housed craftsmen, there would also be separate houses for carpentry, wheel making, shoemaking, etc.|$|E
50|$|High school constructives <b>are</b> <b>typically</b> only 8 minutes, {{and high}} school rebuttals <b>are</b> <b>typically</b> only 5 minutes. College times <b>are</b> <b>typically</b> 9 minute constructives and 6 minute rebuttals.|$|R

5|$|By the 17th dynasty, the Book of the Dead {{had become}} {{widespread}} {{not only for}} members of the royal family, but courtiers and other officials as well. At this stage, the spells <b>were</b> <b>typically</b> inscribed on linen shrouds wrapped around the dead, though occasionally they are found written on coffins or on papyrus.|$|E
5|$|For {{landings}} and take-offs, wire flying riggings were devised and used. On location, {{these were}} suspended from tower cranes, {{whereas in the}} studio elaborate rigs were suspended from the studio ceilings. Some of the wire-flying work was quite audacious considering computer-controlled rigs were not then available—the penultimate shot where Superman flies out of the prison yard for example. Although stuntmen were used, Reeve did {{much of the work}} himself, and was suspended as high as 50feet in the air. Counterweights and pulleys <b>were</b> <b>typically</b> used to achieve flying movement, rather than electronic or motorized devices. The thin wires used to suspend Reeve <b>were</b> <b>typically</b> removed from the film in post-production using rotoscope techniques, although this wasn't necessary in all shots (in certain lighting conditions or when Superman is very distant in the frame, the wires were more or less imperceptible).|$|E
5|$|In 1903, {{secondary}} batteries <b>were</b> <b>typically</b> {{considered to}} be a combination of torpedo defense—defense against smaller boats armed with torpedoes, such as torpedo boats or destroyers—and weapons to attack the lightly armored upper structures of capital ships.|$|E

5|$|In Eastern inland Norway and Trøndelag, {{the houses}} around a tun <b>were</b> <b>typically</b> {{organized}} {{in a square}} (firkanttun); in Gudbrandsdal, there was a distinction between inntun (inner tun) and uttun (outer tun). The configuration of houses also depended on whether the farm was situated on a hill or in flatter terrain.|$|E
5|$|The NWMP was {{commanded}} by {{a relatively small}} team of commissioned officers, having an establishment of 25 officers in its early years, of whom around a quarter were medical and veterinary officers, rising to 50 after 1885, a ratio of approximately one officer to every twenty enlisted men. The officers were usually from middle- or upper-class backgrounds, and <b>were</b> <b>typically</b> Canadian-born; deliberate {{attempts were made to}} reflect the different religious and ethnic groups that made up white Canadian society. They depended on political patronage from the government of the day in Ottawa for their appointment and career progression, and <b>were</b> <b>typically</b> {{selected on the basis of}} their military experience, service in the police ranks or previous study at the Royal Military College in Ontario.|$|E
5|$|The castle's layout {{was unusual}} for the region during this period, where the fortifications built by the Normans <b>were</b> <b>typically</b> smaller ringwork designs, and it {{highlighted}} both the strategic importance of the location {{and the power of}} its builder. In scale and design it was similar to the initial version of Rochester Castle, another major fortification built by Odo in England.|$|E

5|$|These all-infantry {{units were}} {{modelled}} on the cohorts of the legions, {{with the same}} officers and sub-units. They <b>were</b> <b>typically</b> considered {{to be more of}} a light infantry than proper legionaries. Some auxiliaries may however have been equipped with the lorica segmentata, the most sophisticated legionary body-armour, although scholars dispute this.|$|E
5|$|A {{report in}} 2010 by Nekaris etal. {{reported}} that Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand {{were the primary}} exporters of slow lorises, with Singapore and Malaysia also involved. China and Indonesia were also known for international trade, although their local trade was more significant. Slow loris parts <b>were</b> <b>typically</b> exported from Thailand and Cambodia, but Malaysia and Singapore primarily exported live animals. The most noteworthy importer was Japan, followed by the United States and then the European Union. More than half of 400illegal imports were live animals (238), while the rest were either body parts (122) or unspecified (40).|$|E
5|$|A {{supporter}} of nine-man baseball teams, Adams favored a measure in 1856 which allowed for players {{from outside the}} Knickerbockers to join their intrasquad games when 17 or fewer team members appeared. No rules existed at the time regarding team size, but official games between clubs <b>were</b> <b>typically</b> played with nine men per club. The proposal was defeated by a 13–11 vote, {{in favor of a}} rule forbidding non-club members to play if there were 14 players (seven per team).|$|E

50|$|Polarization {{dependent}} isolators <b>are</b> <b>typically</b> used in {{free space}} optical systems. This {{is because the}} polarization of the source <b>is</b> <b>typically</b> maintained by the system. In optical fibre systems, the polarization direction <b>is</b> <b>typically</b> dispersed in non polarization maintaining systems. Hence the angle of polarization {{will lead to a}} loss.|$|R
50|$|The junk sail is a {{low tech}} {{approach}} to sailing and requires only inexpensive components. Spars <b>are</b> <b>typically</b> of wood. Lines for running rigging <b>are</b> <b>typically</b> 3-strand cordage rather than dual core braid. The sailcloth materials <b>are</b> <b>typically</b> light canvas or tarpaulin, used Dacron from discarded sails, or even PVC sheeting.|$|R
5|$|Army {{trousers}} were {{of similar}} pattern to the U.S. Army trousers, or civilian designs, {{depending on the}} area in which they were made. They <b>were</b> <b>typically</b> a shade of gray or brown, with a variety of medium blues also produced. The individual could also have them trimmed to reflect his militia unit, his Non-commissioned officer status, or as a personal flare, to the ubiquitous service pants. Noncommissioned officers were to wear on their outer seams a one and one-quarter inch cotton stripe or braid of colors appropriate to their army branch.|$|E
5|$|Barges {{were also}} used to {{transport}} ice, particularly along the Hudson River, doubling on occasion as storage units as well. These barges could carry between 400 and 800 tons (400,000 to 800,000kg) of ice and, like ice carrying ships, windmills <b>were</b> <b>typically</b> installed to power the barge's bilge pumps. Barges were believed to help preserve ice from melting, as the ice was stored beneath the deck and insulated by the river. Charlie Morse introduced larger, seagoing ice barges in the 1890s in order to supply New York; these were pulled by schooners and could each carry up to 3,000 tons (three million kg) of ice.|$|E
5|$|Caldas da Rainha's {{coat of arms}} {{was granted}} by Queen Leonor, before {{municipal}} coats of arms <b>were</b> <b>typically</b> used in Portugal. The centre of the city's arms consist of the queen's personal arms, flanked on the right by a shrimping net, to commemorate the fishermen who rescued her drowning son Prince Afonso, and on the left a pelican feeding its young, a symbol of her husband, King João II. Because of its early introduction, several elements of the arms violate Portuguese heraldic standards. The municipal flag consists of the coat of arms on a purple and yellow gyronny.|$|E

5|$|Cantor Fitzgerald L.P., an {{investment}} bank on the 101st–105th {{floors of the}} North Tower, lost 658 employees, considerably {{more than any other}} employer. Marsh Inc., located immediately below Cantor Fitzgerald on floors 93–100, lost 358 employees, and 175 employees of Aon Corporation were also killed. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) estimated that about 17,400 civilians were in the World Trade Center complex {{at the time of the}} attacks. Turnstile counts from the Port Authority suggest 14,154 people <b>were</b> <b>typically</b> in the Twin Towers by 8:45a.m. Most people below the impact zone safely evacuated the buildings.|$|E
5|$|Ceremonies came to {{surround}} many memorials; many memorials were formally opened or unveiled in public ceremonies, {{while others were}} used for recurring ceremonies on commemorative days. Memorials in Britain and France <b>were</b> <b>typically</b> opened in civic ceremonies involving local dignitaries, veterans and the next-of-kin of fallen servicemen. Some memorials acquired daily ceremonies; in 1928 it became customary to play the Last Post bugle call at the Menin Gate memorial each evening, for example, and this practice spread to many other similar memorials in France.|$|E
5|$|Chaffee excelled as a Boy Scout, {{earning his}} first merit badge {{at the age}} of thirteen. He earned ten more badges that year. Many of these awards <b>were</b> <b>typically</b> won by the older scouts. He {{continued}} his success by obtaining four additional badges {{at the age of}} fourteen. He won four badges for each of the next two years, and had earned almost all the badges available at the time. After becoming an Eagle Scout, he managed to earn another ten merit badges, for which he was awarded the bronze and gold palms.|$|E
50|$|Leprechaun traps <b>are</b> <b>typically</b> made by {{families}} with children to celebrate Saint Patrick's Day.
