25|$|The next Test was at {{his home}} ground, Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad. In good batting {{conditions}} the Australians had put on 576 runs in their first innings and the West Indies, having lost opener Devon Smith for a duck <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> down the barrel when Ganga came to the crease. In an innings which took 326 minutes, Ganga scored 117 and completed his second Test century in two innings against the Australians.|$|E
25|$|Bangladesh {{failed to}} convert a {{promising}} start into a competitive total {{in the third}} and final ODI of the series, as Maharoof and Lokuhettige conceded 46 runs off the eight opening overs, despite bowling in friendly conditions with plenty of clouds. Lokuhettige was especially expensive, and was duly taken off for Dilhara Fernando, who got the breakthrough for Sri Lanka as Javed Omar was out lbw to Fernando. That started the slide. Maharoof continued from the other end, inducing catches from the bats of Rafique and Shahriar Nafees, and suddenly Bangladesh <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> down a familiar hole, the score 51 for 3 at the end of 10 overs.|$|E
25|$|Opting to bat first, India {{got off to}} a poor start losing Virender Sehwag in {{the third}} over, after he scored three fours off Farveez Maharoof and Dilhara Lokuhettige. The other opener Mahendra Singh Dhoni soon {{followed}} him to the pavilion, and Rahul Dravid and Yuvraj Singh were to rebuild, from the score at 22/2. They played cautiously, yet the former gave away his wicket, pulling to substitute fielder Upul Tharanga at mid-on. More wickets followed in the form of debutante, Suresh Raina, who was trapped leg before wicket in his first ball in senior international cricket, by Muttiah Muralitharan's doosra, as India crumbled to 64/5. Dravid, however, played a reliable knock, and together with another debutante, Yalaka Venugopal Rao, added 58 in thirteen overs. However, it came to an end too early to help India significantly in the late overs, with leg-spinner Upul Chandana sneaking a ball past his bat and pads and having him bowled for 54, and India <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> at a very low score – 123/6 after 33 overs. Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan added 20 each, however, which coupled with Irfan Pathan's slow but steady 21, lifted India to a somewhat competitive score of 205/9 at the end of 50 overs.|$|E

After they arrived, the group was announced by their manager, Alex Abbiss. Bruce remembers that [...] "e came out with no microphones or nothing; we were just right up in the people's faces. Shaggy and I were just fuckin' yelling over our own cassette. The people <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> at us in amazement and bewilderment. They {{must have been in}} shock and awe. We finished our two-song set, and the crowd...didn't cheer or boo. They just stood there, stunned"; they later learned that the concert was supposed to occur earlier in the evening, and that they were performing in the wrong building.|$|E
2500|$|Sheldrake's The Sense of Being Stared At was {{published}} in 2003. The book explores telepathy, precognition, and the [...] "psychic staring effect". It reported on an experiment Sheldrake conducted where blindfolded subjects guessed whether persons <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> at them or at another target. Sheldrake reported subjects exhibiting a weak sense of being stared at, but no sense of not being stared at, and attributed the results to morphic resonance. Sheldrake reported a hit rate of 53.1%, describing two subjects as [...] "nearly always right, scoring way above chance levels".|$|E

2500|$|The hosts Sri Lanka were {{yet again}} {{stunned by the}} West Indies' {{accurate}} and fierce pace bowling, as they chose to bowl first at Kandy. In the third over, they got immediate reward, having Sanath Jayasuriya caught behind off Daren Powell for 2 – however, TV replays indicated that the decision was unjustified. To the West Indians, that mattered little, as it gave them a much needed confidence boost. Ten overs later, Tino Best and Powell had dug out a further three wickets, and Sri Lanka <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> down the barrel at 42 for 4. Thilan Samaraweera and Tillakaratne Dilshan paired up for 56 for the fifth wicket before Best ran out Dilshan, but {{this time there was}} little wagging from the tail, only Muttiah Muralitharan making an unbeaten 18, as Powell took the last three wickets – both Rangana Herath and Lasith Malinga ending up caught behind – and Sri Lanka subsided for 150.|$|E
2500|$|The Gemara helped {{explain why}} (as [...] reports) God chose a rainbow as {{the symbol of}} God's promise. The Mishnah taught with regard to those who take no thought for the honor of their Maker, {{that it would have}} been better if they had not been born. Rabbi Abba read this Mishnah to refer to those who stare at a rainbow, while Rav Joseph said that it refers to those who commit transgressions in secret. The Gemara {{explained}} that those who stare at a rainbow affront God's honor, as [...] compares God's appearance to that of a rainbow: [...] "As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord." [...] Thus those who stare at a rainbow behave as if they <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> directly at God. Similarly, Rabbi Judah ben Rabbi Nahmani, the speaker for Resh Lakish, taught that because [...] compares God's appearance to that of a rainbow, staring at the rainbow harms one's eyesight.|$|E
