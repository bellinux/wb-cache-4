25|$|The high {{real-estate}} {{prices in}} Santa Fe mean {{that many of}} the people <b>who</b> <b>work</b> <b>there</b> commute from the Albuquerque metro area. Furthermore, the capital is home to many of the state’s cultural institutions and tourist attractions, and most out-of-state visitors are forced to make the 60-mile journey from the Albuquerque International Sunport by car. As the population of the region grows, commute times are expected to increase 80% on some routes by 2025, making the introduction of additional forms of transportation a priority to local governments.|$|E

2500|$|There {{were three}} key {{elements}} in the writing process. First, Chibnall largely ignored traditional concepts about narrative structure when writing the teleplay. Instead, he focused on how the murder affected each character, and let each character's responses drive the story. His lone concession to narrative structure was driven {{by the need to}} insert a commercial break every 11 to 12 minutes. He chose to insert a surprising or shocking moment just before each break to encourage viewers to keep watching. This forced Chibnall to [...] "aggressively plot" [...] each episode, keeping the story as tight as possible so that he could focus on character development. Second, Chibnall emphasised the role of the local newspaper in the series. Having lived in the small Dorset town of Bridport, Chibnall saw how local newspapers had a major impact on their communities despite the prominence of new media such as the Internet. He created a fictional local newspaper, the Broadchurch Echo, and made it not only an element of the story (revealing information to which characters react) but also a character in the story itself, motivated by the people <b>who</b> <b>work</b> <b>there.</b> Third, Chibnall planned for a visual rather than dialogue-driven finale. Chibnall wanted the final episode of Broadchurch to be different than the typical murder-mystery series. He observed that most finales saved major revelations until the final minutes of the final episode. He felt this led to poor writing, with loose plot threads [...] "hastily" [...] tied up and no way for the audience to adjust emotionally to the new information. Chibnall decided his [...] "reveal" [...] would occur early in the final episode, and more time would be given to depicting the impact of the reveal on the characters. He also wanted to avoid a reveal which was primarily verbal, as occurred in many detective novels. Chibnall wanted his reveal to be visual and highly cinematic, and for time to slow down during the reveal to heighten the audience's tension. This, he felt, would help the audience feel as if they were actually part of the drama, as if they were really experiencing these events themselves.|$|E
