5|$|As part of Romblon, Banton is {{classified}} under Type III of the Corona climatic classification system. This type of climate {{is described as}} having no prominent <b>wet</b> <b>or</b> dry seasons. The wet season, which usually occurs from June to November can extend up to December during {{the onset of the}} southwest monsoon. The dry season from January to May may sometimes have periods of rainfall or even inclement weather.|$|E
5|$|An ore-bulk-oil carrier, {{also known}} as {{combination}} carrier or OBO, is a ship designed {{to be capable of}} carrying <b>wet</b> <b>or</b> dry bulk cargoes. This design was intended to provide flexibility in two ways. Firstly, an OBO would be able to switch between the dry and wet bulk trades based on market conditions. Secondly, an OBO could carry oil on one leg of a voyage and return carrying dry bulk, reducing the number of unprofitable ballast voyages it would have to make.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic {{ash fall}} is physically, socially, and {{economically}} disruptive. Volcanic ash can affect both proximal areas and areas {{many hundreds of}} kilometres from the source, and causes disruptions and losses {{in a wide variety}} of different infrastructure sectors. Impacts are dependent on: ash fall thickness; the duration of the ash fall; the grain size and chemistry of the ash; whether the ash is <b>wet</b> <b>or</b> dry; and any preparedness, management and prevention (mitigation) measures employed to reduce effects from the ash fall. Different sectors of infrastructure and society are affected in different ways and are vulnerable to a range of impacts or consequences. These are discussed in the following sections.|$|E

5|$|Peniophora quercina is {{a species}} of wood-decay fungus in the family Peniophoraceae. The species {{produces}} fruit bodies which vary in appearance depending on whether they are <b>wet</b> <b>or</b> dry. The wet fruit bodies are waxy and lilac, and attached strongly to the wood. When dry, the edges curl up and reveal the dark underside, while the surface becomes crusty and pink. P.quercina is the type species of Peniophora, and {{was moved to the}} genus upon its creation by Mordecai Cubitt Cooke. The species is found primarily in Europe, where it can be encountered all year. Though primarily growing upon dead wood, especially oak, it is also capable of growing upon still-living wood.|$|E
5|$|The <b>wet,</b> <b>or</b> rainy, {{season is}} the time of year, {{covering}} one or more months, when most of the average annual rainfall in a region falls. The term green season is also sometimes used as a euphemism by tourist authorities. Areas with wet seasons are dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics. Savanna climates and areas with monsoon regimes have wet summers and dry winters. Tropical rainforests technically do not have dry or wet seasons, since their rainfall is equally distributed through the year. Some areas with pronounced rainy seasons will see a break in rainfall mid-season when the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon trough move poleward of their location {{during the middle of the}} warm season. When the wet season occurs during the warm season, or summer, rain falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. The wet season is a time when air quality improves, freshwater quality improves, and vegetation grows significantly.|$|E
5|$|Three {{types of}} song have been described: the day song {{is the most}} common, sung by birds alone or in pairs as a chorus or an antiphonal duet, {{generally}} {{over the course of}} the day and while the birds are in flight. It appears to promote bonding and act as communication. The whisper song is sung more commonly in <b>wet</b> <b>or</b> windy weather, the singer sitting in a tree warbling soft and complex harmonies for up to 45 minutes, often mimicking many other bird species as well as dogs barking, lambs bleating or even people whistling. In the breeding season, pied butcherbirds sing the breeding song at night until dawn, when they switch to the day song. This song is longer and more complex than the day song. In response to threats, pied butcherbirds may chatter or make a harmonic alarm call composed of short, loud descending notes.|$|E

5|$|Damage to {{buildings}} and structures can range from complete or partial roof collapse to less catastrophic damage of exterior and internal materials. Impacts depend on the thickness of ash, whether it is <b>wet</b> <b>or</b> dry, the roof and building design and how much ash gets inside a building. The specific weight of ash can vary significantly and rain can increase this by 50-100%. Problems associated with ash loading are {{similar to that of}} snow; however, ash is more severe as 1) the load from ash is generally much greater, 2) ash does not melt and 3) ash can clog and damage gutters, especially after rain fall. Impacts for ash loading depend on building design and construction, including roof slope, construction materials, roof span and support system, and age and maintenance of the building. Generally flat roofs are more susceptible to damage and collapse than steeply pitched roofs. Roofs made of smooth materials (sheet metal or glass) are more likely to shed ash than roofs made with rough materials (thatch, asphalt or wood shingles). Roof collapse can lead to widespread injuries and deaths and property damage. For example, the collapse of roofs from ash during the 15 June 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption killed about 300 people.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius vietus {{is fairly}} common, {{and can be}} found growing in moist areas under trees in autumn, often among Sphagnum moss. Though it {{strongly}} favours beech, it has also been found under oak. It forms an ectomycorrhizal relationship with the trees under which it grows. It can also be found growing on rotting wood or other hard surfaces; specimens have been observed on both conifer and hardwood logs. These are typically smaller specimens, and it is possible that they represent a dwarf variety. Despite growing on rotting wood, the species is not saprotrophic; instead, the mycelia of the species are linking with tree roots growing through or near the wood. This is a particularly useful adaptation when the soil is either <b>wet</b> <b>or</b> nutrient-poor. Mushrooms can sometimes grow in large numbers, but they can also be found growing in tight clumps, or solitarily when growing out of season. The species can be found in Europe, with collections in Scandinavia, the British Isles Bulgaria, Germany, and northern Turkey; in North America, it has been recorded as common in Canada and both the northern and southern United States; in northern Asia, it was found in regions near both the Oka River and the central Angara River in Siberia; and in eastern Asia, it has been collected in China.|$|E
5|$|Rain hit {{the circuit}} on Saturday afternoon, ending {{three hours before}} the session started, {{resulting}} in several damp patches on the circuit though the air temperature remained hot. Different sections of the circuit dried out at different rates {{making it difficult for}} drivers to tell precisely how <b>wet</b> <b>or</b> dry certain corners were. The teams ran intermediate tyres before switching to the super-soft tyre as the session progressed. Some drivers ran deep into turn five. Vettel was the fastest driver of the session with a time of 1:48.028 set in the last twenty minutes of the one-hour period. The time was four-tenths faster than championship rival Alonso. Hamilton was third fastest, two-thousandths of a second in front of Massa. Rosberg was fifth, ahead of Webber and Nico Hülkenberg. Kubica, Sutil and Buemi completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Hispania Racing driver Bruno Senna's right-rear tyre got onto a white line at the Singapore Sling chicane and spun. Senna later brushed a wall entering the Esplanade Bridge in the final minute and stopped his car, causing the yellow-flags to be shown; drivers were unable to improve on their lap times because of the limited time available.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, modern {{equipment}} {{was developed to}} reduce injuries. The football helmet, although a scapegoat for concussions, serves as effective protection against more dangerous injuries like skull fractures. The modern helmet traces its roots back to the leather helmets used by football players in the early 1900s {{to protect themselves from}} head injuries. Helmets later evolved to be made of hard plastic, and a facemask was added to protect players from sustaining facial injuries. Many players also wear mouthguards to prevent injuries to their teeth and tongues; at some levels, such as the NCAA, the use of a mouthguard is mandatory. Football players wear a number of pads to protect themselves – shoulder pads are the most important pads, protecting the shoulder and sternum, but thigh pads, hip pads, tail pads, and knee pads are also used. Many quarterbacks wear flak jackets to protect their ribcage. Cleats come in a number of lengths, with players choosing which cleat to use based on the playing field – on artificial turf, for example, players prefer a shorter cleat to prevent their feet from digging into the ground and risking injury, while longer cleats are generally used on fields that are <b>wet</b> <b>or</b> slippery to provide better traction. Athletic cups are not typically used at the professional level, because athletic cups tend to make it harder to move and there is an unwritten code among players not to target the groin area. Additionally, studies have shown that proper conditioning techniques, fitness routines and exercise routines, as well as high-quality equipment and coaching, can reduce the risk of injury among players.|$|E

Other forms of urolagnia may involve {{a tendency to}} be sexually aroused by smelling urine-soaked clothing or body parts. In many cases, a strong correlation or conditioning arises between urine smell or sight, and the sexual act. For some individuals the phenomenon may include a diaper fetish and/or arousal from infantilism.|$|R
