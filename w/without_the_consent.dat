5|$|In ancient times, land {{appears to}} have been held in common with an {{individual}} unable to sell it <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> of the other owners, who in most cases were members of the same community. Prior to the arrival of the British, the concept of individual proprietorship of land had already emerged along India's west coast such that the new administration's land revenue system was not markedly different from that of its predecessor. Nevertheless, landlords never sold land <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> of other members of the community. This communistic property rights system was known as kaniachi among the Vellalars, swastium among the Brahmins and mirasi among Muslims and Christians. In the Tanjore district, all mirasi in the village were vested in a single individual who was called the Ekabhogam. The mirasidars were required to donate {{a certain amount of money}} known as mirei to the village administration. They also paid a specified sum to the Government. In return, the mirasidars demanded non-interference by the government in the internal affairs of the villages.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the famine, an increase in industrial production and a surge in trade brought a succession of construction booms. The population soared {{in the latter part of}} this century and the architectural legacy of Georgian Ireland was built. In 1782, Poynings' Law was repealed, giving Ireland legislative independence from Great Britain for the first time since 1495. The British government, however, still retained the right to nominate the government of Ireland <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> of the Irish parliament.|$|E

5|$|After {{the failed}} August Coup of 1991 Boris Yeltsin and the Ministry of Finance of the RSFSR claimed {{authority}} over the Ministry of Finance of the USSR, the state bank and the Bank of Foreign Economic Activity. This meant that the institutions could not carry out any orders <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> of the RSFSR government. The Ministry of Finance continued functioning until the RSFSR government issued a decree completing its takeover of the Soviet financial system. It was succeeded by the Ministry of Economics and Finance of the Russian Federation (1991) and the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation (1992). The last Soviet Minister of Finance was Vladimir Yefimovich Orlov, and Vladimir Rayevsky was acting Minister {{during the period of}} transition.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the end of}} the year, Gaveston had {{returned}} to England, and civil war appeared imminent. In May 1312, Gaveston was taken captive by the Earl of Pembroke, but Warwick and Lancaster had him abducted and executed after a mock trial. This affront to Pembroke’s honour drove him irrevocably into the camp of the king, and thereby split the opposition. The brutality of the act initially drove Lancaster and his adherents away from the centre of power, but the Battle of Bannockburn, in June 1314, returned the initiative. Edward was humiliated by his disastrous defeat, while Lancaster and Warwick had not taken part in the campaign, claiming that it was carried out <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> of the baronage, and as such in defiance of the Ordinances.|$|E

Further, the defendant has a right to a trial by jury if the actual sentence exceeds six months and the charged crime has no maximum authorized sentence (e.g. contempt of court).|$|E

According to that treaty, Géza promised that he would not depose or transfer prelates <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> of the Holy See; on the other hand, the pope acknowledged that no papal legates could be sent to Hungary without the king's permission and the Hungarian prelates were only allowed to appeal to the Holy See with the king's consent. He also signed a truce for five years with the Byzantine Empire. Shortly before his death, Géza granted Dalmatia, Croatia and other territories to his younger son, Béla, as an appanage duchy. Géza died on 31 May 1162 and was buried in Székesfehérvár.|$|E

In mid-1969, Nixon began efforts to negotiate {{peace with the}} North Vietnamese, sending a personal letter to North Vietnamese leaders, and peace talks began in Paris. Initial talks, however, {{did not result in}} an agreement. In May 1969 he publicly proposed to withdraw all American troops from South Vietnam provided North Vietnam also did so and for South Vietnam to hold internationally supervised elections with Viet Cong participation.|$|E

A Jehovah's Witness minister from Lake Jackson preached in English, quoting Paul the Apostle's words in 1 Corinthians 15. Hundreds of people began circling {{the area in}} their vehicles. Among the celebrities who attended Selena's funeral were Roberto Pulido, Bobby Pulido, David Lee Garza, Navaira, Laura Canales, Elsa Garcia, La Mafia, Ram Herrera, Imagen Latina, and Pete Astudillo. A special mass held the same day at Los Angeles Sports Arena drew a crowd of 4,000.|$|E
5|$|Opeth {{was formed}} in 1990 by vocalist David Isberg. He later {{recruited}} bassist Mikael Åkerfeldt <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> of the other band members he previously hired, {{which resulted in the}} departure of all members except Isberg and Åkerfeldt. Isberg soon left, but Åkerfeldt decided to remain in the band and keep it in activity. For this he contacted guitarist Peter Lindgren, bassist Johan De Farfalla, and drummer Anders Nordin. With this lineup, they recorded a demo, which led to the band’s first record label contract. Candlelight Records signed the band. In 1995, Opeth released their first studio album, Orchid, and after more changes to the lineup, the band released Morningrise and My Arms, Your Hearse in 1996 and 1997 respectively.|$|E
5|$|A major push {{occurred}} in 2002 when officials from Emery County, joined by Utah governor Mike Leavitt, petitioned President George W. Bush {{to use the}} authority of the Antiquities Act and create a San Rafael Swell National Monument. This effort lost momentum after the governor promised to honor the wishes of Emery County residents via a non-binding referendum, which did not pass. Common reasons given by residents for opposing the designation included fear of the federal government restricting access and a repetition of events that occurred with the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. This monument was established in 1996, by President Bill Clinton. In that case the monument was proposed at the federal level in secret. Boundaries were drawn <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> or even knowledge of local residents. This incited anger and triggered a backlash in rural Utah.|$|E

5|$|Admiral Nimitz {{recommended}} to the Joint Chiefs of Staff that development {{and control of}} the base facilities be placed under SOPAC by extending its border westward to include the Admiralties. MacArthur was furious; the borders of SWPA could not be changed <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> of the Australian government. Nimitz's proposal was eventually turned down by the Joint Chiefs but not before MacArthur restricted access to the facilities to ships of the United States Seventh Fleet and British Pacific Fleet. Halsey was summoned to MacArthur's headquarters in Brisbane on 3March 1944, and the two agreed to a compromise. Responsibility {{for the development of the}} base passed from Krueger's Alamo Force to Kinkaid's Allied Naval Forces on 18May 1944. It was proposed control would ultimately pass to SOPAC but it never did.|$|E
5|$|Barley evidently {{decided that}} it was futile to {{continue}} resisting the Stationers' Company, and on 15 May 1605, he successfully petitioned the Drapers' Company for a transfer to the Stationers' Company. On 25 June 1606, the Stationers' Company admitted him as a member. That same day, the Company's court, which had the authority to resolve disputes between members, negotiated a settlement in a lawsuit Barley had brought against East concerning the copyrights on certain music books. East claimed that since he had lawfully entered the books into the Company's register, the rights of the works belonged to him. Barley disagreed, claiming that the works were his through his partnership with Morley, who had held the royal music patent. The court's compromise settlement recognised the rights of both, stipulating that if East were to print an edition of any of the books in question, he was to acknowledge Barley's name on the imprint, pay Barley 20 shillings, and supply him with six free copies. On the other hand, Barley could not publish any of the books <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> of East or his wife.|$|E
5|$|In September 2014, Modi {{introduced}} the Make in India initiative to encourage foreign companies to manufacture products in India, {{with the goal}} of turning the country into a global manufacturing hub. Supporters of economic liberalisation supported the initiative, while critics argued it would allow foreign corporations to capture a greater share of the Indian market. In order to enable the construction of private industrial corridors, the Modi administration passed a land-reform bill that allowed it to acquire private agricultural land without conducting a social impact assessment, and <b>without</b> <b>the</b> <b>consent</b> of the farmers who owned it. Under the previous bill, the government had required the consent of 80% of the owners of a piece of property before acquiring it for a private project: this requirement was waived. The bill was passed via an executive order after it faced opposition in parliament, but was eventually allowed to lapse. Modi's government put in place the Goods and Services Tax, the biggest tax reform in the country since independence. It subsumed around 17 different taxes and became effective from 1 July 2017.|$|E
