5|$|Combat trials {{began in}} mid-September 1944 and were {{generally}} very positive. However four aircraft were lost to engine failures and the engines suffered from numerous lesser problems, despite its satisfactory {{service in the}} La-5FN.

One batch of flawed wings was built and caused six accidents, four of them fatal, in October <b>which</b> <b>caused</b> the fighter to be grounded until the cause {{was determined to be}} a defect in the wing spar.|$|E

5000|$|On Earth, an {{atmosphere}} containing naturally occurring amounts {{of greenhouse gases}} causes air temperature near the surface to be about [...] warmer {{than it would be}} in their absence. Without the Earth's atmosphere, the Earth's average temperature would be well below the freezing temperature of water.
