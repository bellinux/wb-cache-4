500|$|I {{can only}} {{remember}} {{bits and pieces}} of the game. I was psyched. I had a feeling of euphoria. I was zeroed in on the [...] glove, but I didn't hit the glove too much. I remember hitting a couple of batters, and the bases were loaded two or three times. The ball was small sometimes, the ball was large sometimes, sometimes I saw the catcher, sometimes I didn't. Sometimes, I tried to stare the hitter down and throw while I <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> I chewed my gum until it turned to powder. I started having a crazy idea in the fourth inning that Richard Nixon was the home plate umpire, and once I thought I was pitching a baseball to Jimi Hendrix, who to me was holding a guitar and swinging it over the plate. They say I had about three to four fielding chances. I remember diving {{out of the way of}} a ball I thought was a line drive. I jumped, but the ball wasn't hit hard and never reached me.|$|E
500|$|Once {{they have}} all four key cards, Bart and Homer {{infiltrate}} the creator's mansion. They are greeted by Matt Groening, who sends Futurama characters Bender and Dr. Zoidberg after them. The family manages to defeat them, however, and Groening admits that he is only creating new games for the money, and destroys the game engine. [...] The Simpsons, along with several other characters from the games escape to Springfield, where the aliens are still attacking. Lisa uses her power to create a stairway to heaven, and the family asks God for advice. After he is defeated {{in a game of}} Dance Dance Revolution, God reveals that the video game that they're in is a mini-game in another video game about Earth. He dropped the video game manual by accident, thus endowing the family with superpowers. Realizing his misdemeanor, he promises to restore Springfield, let them keep their powers, and to improve the working conditions of all video game characters. He also gives Homer three wishes. As the game ends, it turns out that Ralph Wiggum is playing the entire game before he looks at the screen, wondering who <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Even {{though the}} able-bodied men were gone, people still {{resisted}} being {{forced out of}} their dwellings and tried to desert from the columns as they moved through {{the eastern part of}} the ghetto. [...] The Nazis murdered 600 to 1,000 people in the process of forcing out the people. Eventually columns of about 1,000 people were formed and marched out. [...] The first column was led by the lawyer, Dr. Eljaschow. [...] "The expression on his face showed no disquiet whatsoever; on the contrary, because everyone <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> he made an effort to smile hopefully." [...] Next to Dr. Eljaschow was Rabbi Zack. [...] Other well-known citizens of Riga were in the columns. Among the guards were Altmeyer, Jäger, and Herberts Cukurs. [...] Cukurs, a world-famous pilot, was the most recognizable Latvian SD man at the scene, whom Kaufmann described as follows: ...|$|E

2500|$|Wes Craven {{said his}} {{inspiration}} for the basis of Freddy Krueger's power stemmed from several stories in the Los Angeles Times about a series of mysterious deaths: All the victims had reported recurring nightmares and died in their sleep. Additionally, Craven's original script characterized Freddy as a child molester, which Craven said was the [...] "worst thing" [...] he could think of. The {{decision was made to}} instead make him a child murderer in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time A Nightmare on Elm Street went into production. Craven's inspirations for the character included a bully from his school during his youth, a disfigured homeless man who had frightened him when he was 11, and the 1970s pop song [...] "Dream Weaver" [...] by Gary Wright. In an interview, he said, [...] "When I looked down there was a man very much like Freddy walking along the sidewalk. He must have sensed that someone <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> and stopped and looked right into my face. He scared the living daylights out of me, so I jumped back into the shadows. I waited and waited to hear him walk away. Finally I thought he must have gone, so I stepped back to the window. The guy was not only still looking at me but he thrust his head forward as if to say, 'Yes, I'm still looking at you.' The man walked towards the apartment building's entrance. I ran through the apartment to our front door as he was walking into our building on the lower floor. I heard him starting up the stairs. My brother, who is ten years older than me, got a baseball bat and went out to the corridor but he was gone." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Buffin did {{not affect}} to misunderstand. Sid Marks <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in that nasty way. Otto the Sausage <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in that nasty way. Rabbit Butler <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in that nasty way. This was an {{occasion}} where manly frankness was the quality most to be aimed at. To be misunderstood in the circles in which Mr. Buffin moved meant something more than the mere risk of being treated with cold displeasure.|$|E

60|$|He {{stopped in}} confusion. Miss Gwilt's eyes <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> again, and Miss Gwilt's hand had {{found its way}} once more into his own.|$|R
60|$|That {{was about}} all the {{explanation}} Leland ever got, but in another moment or two the trooper, who seemed to <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> curiously, spoke again.|$|R

60|$|There was no {{one there}} but the old people, who <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in bewilderment. They did not notice any {{confusion}} in Agnes's face. She recovered first.|$|R

60|$|Half an {{hour later}} the bell rang for me. Mr. Dark was sitting between my {{mistress}} (who <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> in amazement) and the lawyer (who <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with approval). He had a map open on his knee, and a pen in his hand. Judging by his face, the communication of the secret about my master {{did not seem to}} have made the smallest impression on him.|$|E
60|$|He {{hesitated for}} a moment, but the Duchess <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> She evidently {{expected}} him to continue the subject.|$|E

6000|$|... "His {{title is}} the Marquis of Lambeth," [...] said Beaumont; {{and then he}} was silent. Bessie Alden {{appeared}} to <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with interest. [...] "He is the son of the Duke of Bayswater," [...] he added presently.|$|R

This change is very apt to occur in statues." ...|$|R
