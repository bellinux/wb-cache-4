25|$|The {{route from}} Scafell Pike to Scafell (or its reverse) {{is one of}} the most {{frustrating}} in the Lake District. <b>What</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> direct route is in fact very hazardous as it has to negotiate Broad Stand crag, which is a dangerous and exposed scramble that has caused many accidents and injuries. It is usually treated as a rock climb, with appropriate ropes and belay protection. Wainwright warns against its dangers to walkers. Its dangers are more obvious travelling from Scafell Pike, but travelling from Scafell, the route loses a lot of height before the danger is seen.|$|E
500|$|The fifth part of [...] "Trinity War" [...] {{was given}} 4 stars out of 5 by Doug Zawiska at Comic Book Resources. He said, [...] "The pacing of Justice League Dark #23 is smart and gives readers lots to chew on, {{but it also}} leaves <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lot left to be {{resolved}} in the approaching final chapter of [...] "Trinity War"." [...] He also praised Janin's ability to accurately draw the characters used in the issue. Joshua Yehl of IGN also had similar sentiments, saying [...] "While [...] "Trinity War’s" [...] overall story is wonky, this chapter of Justice League Dark at least makes it a fun time." [...] He also enjoyed Janin's art and gave the issue a 7.6 out of 10. Richard Gray of Newsarama gave the issue an 8 out of 10, saying, [...] "Everything about this issue feels like a climax...even if next week’s final chapter proves {{to be less than}} definitive." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Folie à Deux" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics. Francis Dass of New Straits Times was positive toward the episode, considering it [...] "highly watchable". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a glowing review and awarded it an [...] "A". He praised {{the way it}} [...] "starts out as <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Mulder-centric episode, then slowly inverts on itself to become a Scully-centric episode". VanDerWerff also positively critiqued {{the manner in which}} [...] "the monster [...] works on a metaphorical level as well". He concluded that the episode's main theme—that [...] "adness is always better when shared by two"—was a [...] "great idea" [...] that resulted in [...] "one of the greatest episodes the show ever did". John Keegan from Critical Myth awarded the episode a 7 out of 10 and called it [...] "a pleasant enough diversion" [...] from the then-upcoming series feature film. He wrote that, while the episode fits the mold of [...] "the traditional late-season summary of the evolving character dynamic", the entry manages to frame Scully’s psychology [...] "in the limelight" [...] without actually [...] "emphasiz Scully herself".|$|E

2500|$|... "The Tour of Flanders {{is unlike}} any other bike race in the world. It is, without question, the hardest one-day bike race ever created. <b>What</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> million corners, {{combined}} with twenty to thirty steep pitches and narrow roads, none of which go the same direction {{for more than a}} mile, all mix together to make it war on a bike. There isn’t a race in North America that compares. Flanders may as well be a different sport."– George Hincapie ...|$|E
2500|$|Con men and grifters too may use {{techniques}} of conjuring for fraudulent goals. Cheating at card games {{is an obvious}} example, and not a surprising one: {{one of the most}} respected textbooks of card techniques for magicians, The Expert at the Card Table by Erdnase, was primarily written as an instruction manual for card sharps. The card trick known as [...] "Find the Lady" [...] or [...] "Three-card Monte" [...] is an old favourite of street hustlers, who lure the victim into betting on <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> simple proposition: to identify, after a seemingly easy-to-track mixing sequence, which one of three face-down cards is the Queen. Another example is the shell game, in which a pea is hidden under one of three walnut shells, then shuffled around the table (or sidewalk) so slowly as to make the pea's position seemingly obvious. Although these are well known as frauds, people still lose money on them; a shell-game ring was broken up in Los Angeles as recently as December 2009.|$|E
2500|$|... {{uses the}} device of the {{palimpsest}} {{to present a}} fictional tissue combining elements of both ancient and modern sources {{as well as the}} [...] "dialogue" [...] of its two protagonists. It is composed of a series of fragmented entries in a fictional diary recording the experiences of an unnamed protagonist during a train journey into an unknown land. The man has been released - or escaped - from some time of confinement elliptically described in his journal and reminiscent of a hospital, prison, ghetto or enclave of some sort. His subsequent wanderings among desolate landscapes on the verge of reality are set in a closely detailed, and somehow Kafkaesque, atmosphere, undercutting the point that the most dreamlike occurrences are also the realest. Along the way, the protagonist delves deeper in <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> quasi-religious quest while, at the same time, his growing impression of being stalked introduces an element of suspense and a film noir-like quality. Thus, the text hinges on the metaphysical but is also reminiscent of an L.A. private eye in a 1940s detective novel closing upon an extraordinary discovery. Z213: Exit ends with a description of a sacrifice where the protagonist and a [...] "hungry band feasting" [...] roast a lamb on a spit, cutting and skinning its still bleating body and removing its entrails as if observing a sacred rite.|$|E

6000|$|The prosperous days {{of every}} life pass away at last. Suffering and sorrow, failure and reverse {{are sure to}} await all who live out {{anything}} like their term of years, and the missionary is perhaps more liable than other men {{to meet with a}} great disappointment. 'Success but signifies vicissitude,' and looking at the history of the growth of the Church, it is impossible not to observe that almost in all cases, immediately upon any extensive progress, there has followed <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> strong effort of the Evil One at its frustration, either by external persecution, reaction of heathenism, or, most fatally and frequently during the last 300 years, from the reckless misdoings of unscrupulous sailors and colonists. The West Indies, Japan, America, all have the same shameful tale to tell--what wonder if the same shadow were to be cast over the Isles of the South? ...|$|E
6000|$|Did {{you ever}} try it, reader? If not, take an {{imaginary}} trip with us, just for experiment. [...] "There's the boat!"

[...] exclaim a dozen of voices, and forthwith a dozen heads {{go out of the}} window. [...] "Why, down there, under that bridge; don't you see those lights?" [...] "What! that little thing?" [...] exclaims an inexperienced traveller; [...] "dear me! we can't half of us get into it!" [...] "We! indeed," [...] says some old hand in the business; [...] "I think you'll find it will hold us and a dozen more loads like us." [...] "Impossible!" [...] say some. [...] "You'll see," [...] say the initiated; and, {{as soon as you get}} out, you do see, and hear too, <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> general breaking loose from the Tower of Babel, amid a perfect hail storm of trunks, boxes, valises, carpet bags, and every describable and indescribable form of what a westerner calls [...] "plunder." ...|$|E

Don't make me crush it. Don't destroy <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{beautiful}} dream. You can be patient for a little while, can you not? You shall be my dearest friend, my life shall be moulded as you will--listen, I will swear {{that no one in}} this world shall ever have a single word of love from me save you. Don't wreck our lives, dear, just from an impulse. Do you know you have saved me from a nightmare? I am older than you, Douglas, and I was beginning to wonder, to fear, whether I might not be one of those poor, unfortunate creatures to whom God has never given the power to love anything--and life sometimes was so cold and lonely. You could light it all for me, dear, with your love. You have shown me how different it could be. Don't go away.|$|E

6000|$|This is the lesson, I think, {{of what we}} call {{folklore}} or anthropology, {{which to}} many seems trivial, to many seems dull. It may become the most attractive and serious of the sciences; certainly it is rich in strange curiosities, like those mystic stones which were fingered and arrayed by the pupils in that allegory of Novalis. I am not likely to regret the accident which brought me up on fairy tales, and the inquisitiveness which led me to examine the other fragments of antiquity. But the poetry and the significance of them are apt to be hidden by the enormous crowd of details. Only late we find the true meaning of <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> mass of fantastic, savage eccentricities. I very well remember the moment when it occurred to me, soon after taking my degree, that the usual ideas about some of these matters were the reverse of the truth, that the common theory had to be inverted.
