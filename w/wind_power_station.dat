50|$|Aesthetic {{considerations}} of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> have often {{a significant role}} in their evaluation process. To some, the perceived aesthetic aspects of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> may conflict with the protection of historical sites. <b>Wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> {{are less likely to be}} perceived negatively in urbanized and industrial regions. Aesthetic issues are subjective and some people find wind farms pleasant or see them as symbols of energy independence and local prosperity. While studies in Scotland predict wind farms will damage tourism, in other countries some wind farms have themselves become tourist attractions, with several having visitor centers at ground level or even observation decks atop turbine towers.|$|R

40|$|Recently the <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> {{generation}} has attracted special interest and many <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> are being in {{service in the}} world. In the <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations,</b> induction machines are mostly used as a generator. Since induction machines can become unstable during a fault in power system, like a step-out of synchronous machines, {{it is important to}} analyze the stability of <b>power</b> system including <b>wind</b> generators.

40|$|AIM: As {{global warming}} is a fact and the {{consumption}} of energy is continuously increasing, alternative sourcing of energy is a must. The use of oil and coal for heating is limited due to it is nature resource which is also limited. Everyone {{will be forced to}} evaluate their own usage of energy and look into the alternatives of how {{to be a part of}} solving this global issue. For many, alternatives such as sun panels and <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> could be an alternative power source.   Today, there is only a limited availability in Sweden of small sized <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> and only small local producers or importers that sell the equipment – mostly through internet based market communications.   Method: The theoretical approach to this thesis is based on the MIO model in combination with several other models and tools such as, PESTEL, Marketing Mix, SWOT, Porter’s five forces, EVC and STP.   Result & Conclusions: There is a market for small <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> between 5 – 50 kW in Sweden. The biggest reason why the market segment exist and will increase is due to continuously increasing energy prices and that <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> of this size are permitted to be connected directly to household consumption.   Suggestions for future research: How are other energy complements like solar panels influenced? What governmental decisions affect the business of small <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations?</b>   Contributions to the thesis: Success in this segment requires a different approach to product offering than what the current competition is doing...|$|R
