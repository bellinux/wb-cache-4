He co-produced this record with funky rapper and producer, Stefan Adamek. While <b>Hammer's</b> <b>appearance</b> changed {{to keep up with}} the gangsta rap audience, his lyrics still remained honest and somewhat clean with minor swearing. Yet, on this album as <b>with</b> previous records, <b>Hammer</b> would continue to call out other rappers who had dissed him.|$|R

2500|$|In 1993, Hammer began {{recording}} {{his fifth}} official album. To {{adapt to the}} changing landscape of hip-hop, this album was a more aggressive sounding album entitled The Funky Headhunter. He co-produced this record with funky rapper and producer, Stefan Adamek. While <b>Hammer's</b> <b>appearance</b> changed {{to keep up with}} the gangsta rap audience, his lyrics still remained honest and somewhat clean with minor profanity. Yet, as <b>with</b> previous records, <b>Hammer</b> would continue to call out and disrespect other rappers on this album. As with some earlier songs such as [...] "Crime Story" [...] (from the album Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em), the content and reality about [...] "street life" [...] remained somewhat the same, but the sound was different, resulting in <b>Hammer</b> losing favor <b>with</b> fans. Nonetheless, this harder-edged, more aggressive record went gold, but failed to win him a new audience among hardcore hip-hop fans.|$|R

5000|$|According to legend, Pythagoras {{discovered}} {{the foundations of}} musical tuning by listening {{to the sounds of}} four blacksmith's hammers, which produced consonance and dissonance when they were struck simultaneously. According to Nicomachus in his 2nd century CE Enchiridion harmonices [...] Pythagoras noticed that hammer A produced consonance <b>with</b> <b>hammer</b> B when they were struck together, and hammer C produced consonance <b>with</b> <b>hammer</b> A, but hammers B and C produced dissonance <b>with</b> each other. <b>Hammer</b> D produced such perfect consonance <b>with</b> <b>hammer</b> A that they seemed to be [...] "singing" [...] the same note. Pythagoras rushed into the blacksmith shop to discover why, and found that the explanation was in the weight ratios. The hammers weighed 12, 9, 8, and 6 pounds respectively. Hammers A and D were in a ratio of 2:1, which is the ratio of the octave. Hammers B and C weighed 9 and 8 pounds. Their ratios <b>with</b> <b>hammer</b> A were (12:9 = 4:3 = perfect fourth) and (12:8 = 3:2 = perfect fifth). The space between B and C is a ratio of 9:8, which is equal to the musical whole tone, or whole step interval.|$|R
