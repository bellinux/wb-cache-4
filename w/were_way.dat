The animators began by drawing an accurate caricature of Schwarzenegger, {{but one of the}} staff instead suggested an altered version of recurring character Rainer Wolfcastle as President. This idea was developed, with the design of Wolfcastle, himself also a caricature of Schwarzenegger, being given more wrinkles under his eyes and a different hairstyle.|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{opening scene}} depicts a fire fight during the Gulf War. This sequence, which took {{two days to}} film, was shot on a dry expanse of land located an hour outside of Los Angeles. This area had been {{selected}} due to its resembles to an Iraqi desert. Series' co-executive producer Michelle MacLaren said: [...] "We [...] <b>were</b> <b>way</b> {{out in the desert}} and we drove around this corner of these hills and I felt like we had entered another country. It was so desolate, and there were these stone buildings that looked like a bomb had gone off in them. It was perfect." [...] To add authenticity to the shoot, several of the extras used during this scene were former US military personnel.|$|E
500|$|In June 2011, Walt Disney Studios set a July 26, 2013, {{release date}} for the Thor sequel with Chris Hemsworth reprising {{his role as the}} title hero. It was also {{reported}} that Branagh would not be returning as director but would likely be involved in a producing capacity. The Los Angeles Times cited the long commitment necessary for a special effects-heavy epic and the pressure to start the script process right away as reasons for Branagh's departure, although he was initially enthused by the chance to direct the sequel. Branagh noted, [...] "It was a long time [...] and they <b>were</b> <b>way</b> too quick for me to get straight back into another, [...] it was a pleasurable experience and a film I'm very proud of." [...] The following day, Marvel formally hired Payne, one of the credited writers of the first film, to script the sequel. In August, Brian Kirk entered early negotiations to direct the Thor sequel. The film would have marked Kirk's first time directing a big-budget motion picture, after having directed television series for HBO, Showtime and the BBC, including Game of Thrones.|$|E

500|$|The Saturn's design {{elicited}} mixed commentary among game {{developers and}} journalists. Developers quoted by Next Generation in December 1995 described the Saturn as [...] "a real coder's machine" [...] for [...] "those {{who love to}} get their teeth into assembly and really hack the hardware", with [...] "more flexibility" [...] and [...] "more calculating power than the PlayStation". The Saturn's sound board was also widely praised. By contrast, Lobotomy Software programmer Ezra Dreisbach described the Saturn as significantly slower than the PlayStation, whereas Kenji Eno of WARP observed little {{difference between the two}} systems. In particular, Dreisbach criticized the Saturn's use of quadrilaterals as its basic geometric primitive, in contrast to the triangles rendered by the PlayStation and the Nintendo 64. Ken Humphries of Time Warner Interactive remarked that compared to the PlayStation, the Saturn was markedly worse at generating polygons but markedly better at sprite-based graphics. Third-party development was initially hindered by the lack of useful software libraries and development tools, requiring developers to write in assembly language to achieve good performance. During early Saturn development, programming in assembly could offer a two-to-fivefold speed increase over higher-level languages like C.s number crunching was handled by four serial DSPs that <b>were</b> <b>way</b> too costly to be included in any home system. Sega's consequent development of the SH-2 meant that it could also produce a Saturn-compatible arcade system.}} The Saturn hardware is considered extremely difficult to emulate. Sega responded to complaints about the difficulty of programming for the Saturn by writing new graphics libraries which were claimed to make development easier. Sega of America also purchased a United Kingdom-based development firm, Cross Products, to produce the Saturn's official development system. Despite these challenges, Treasure CEO Masato Maegawa stated that the Nintendo 64 was more difficult to develop for than the Saturn. Traveller's Tales' Jon Burton opined that while the PlayStation was easier [...] "to get started on... you quickly reach [...] limits", whereas the Saturn's [...] "complicated" [...] hardware had the ability to [...] "improve the speed and look of a game when all used together correctly." [...] A major point of criticism was the Saturn's use of 2D sprites to generate polygons and simulate 3D space. The PlayStation functioned in a similar manner, but also featured a dedicated [...] "Geometry Transfer Engine" [...] that rendered additional polygons. As a result, several analysts described the Saturn as an [...] "essentially" [...] 2D system.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the book}} Ehrlich {{presented}} {{a number of}} [...] "scenarios" [...] detailing possible future events, {{some of which have}} been used as examples of errors in the years since. Of these scenarios, Ehrlich has said that although, [...] "we clearly stated that they were not predictions and that 'we can be sure that none of them will come true as stated,’ (p.72) – their failure to occur is often cited as a failure of prediction. In honesty, the scenarios <b>were</b> <b>way</b> off, especially in their timing (we underestimated the resilience of the world system). But they did deal with future issues that people in 1968 should have been thinking about." [...] Ehrlich further states that he still endorses the main thesis of the book, and that its message is as apt now as it was in 1968.|$|E

Hal Smith was in an extended slump during the Cardinals spring training, so Landrith was the opening day starting catcher on April 15 against the Chicago Cubs in a 4-0 defeat. After batting [...]125 in his first three games, Hal Smith and Ray Katt alternated starting at catcher through May 11 before Smith finally began to work {{his way out of}} his hitting funk and once again became the team's number one catcher.

2500|$|Lechuza was {{released}} on May 22, 2001 and debuted on No.87 of the Billboard 200, with its single [...] "Threesome" [...] reaching No.66 on the UK Singles Chart. The album featured a total of eleven songs, {{all of which were}} more raucous and energetic than those on the band's previous efforts, with occasional escapes into heavy metal-esque guitar distortion paired with screaming vocal patterns. The reason for the change in style was Lewis' and DeLaPaz's constant feelings of disapproval for the band's songs, as revealed by Salazar in an interview in late 2002: [...] " [...] for Lechuza the guys were looking for a different direction so they wrote some songs that <b>were</b> <b>way</b> different, like Something Bad's Gonna Happen and Pasture of Muppets, just so that they could have some songs that they could, in their words, actually have fun playing onstage."

2500|$|Taking {{their name}} from the David Bowie song with the same title, Pritchard {{revealed}} the first song they ever played as a group was a cover version of The Strokes' song [...] "Reptilia". The Kooks recorded an EP demo, sending it out in search of gigs; they instead received offers from managers and record companies. The band had only been together as a group for four months when they signed with Virgin Records, after being spotted by several label scouts at the Brighton Free Butt Festival in 2005. In an interview with musicOMH, Pritchard revealed [...] "It was really quick how it all happened, we did a demo with a mate of ours in London, which we sent off to one guy to get some gigs, and {{he turned out to}} be a manager. He rung us up and it kind of went from there." [...] The members of the band have since revealed that they felt they weren’t ready at the time, [...] "We <b>were</b> <b>way</b> too early to sign a record deal ... We were really young, we'd been together like two or three months, so we really didn't want to sign. But then we thought it's a really good opportunity and Virgin seemed like really cool people - they just seemed to really understand where we were coming from.," [...] said Pritchard, who has also complimented the space the record label allowed for the band to grow, [...] "They were patient with us and let us develop our style, whatever it was." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a June 2003 interview, Maida {{explained}} that lyrically, his {{words on the}} album would follow the music and would be very much {{a product of the}} times. [...] "I think it's {{going to be a little}} more raw, a little bit more in your face, not a lot of relationship stuff," [...] he says, noting that fans would get a preview of a couple of the tracks, [...] "Wipe That Smile Off Your Face" [...] and [...] "Walking In Circles", on the current tour. [...] "My head, with what's going on in the world and being able to reflect on all the (stuff) that I've done in the last few years in terms of going to Iraq, working very closely with War Child, I'm in that mode. I'm not angry, but kind of frustrated." [...] After observing the plight in Sudan and Darfur, Maida returned with a different outlook on his lyrics and became more outspoken. “There were some [...] that <b>were</b> <b>way</b> too over the top and preachy,” he admits, “and I had to pull a lot of stuff back. This isn’t a solo record for me, this is Our Lady Peace, so I have three people that I contend with in terms of how far I can go with saying things.” Bassist Coutts added [...] "A lot of things he was talking about lyrically were things that we discussed as a band in spending all that time together. I also think that becoming a father also let him deal with issues that he hadn't dealt with before. Although there are some of the darkest lyrics ever on this record, I think there are also some very positive ones as well." [...] The content of the album's lyrics have led it to be classified as a politically charged album, which the band hasn't denied.|$|E
2500|$|India {{were reduced}} to shambles at 62/3, and then Ganguly {{came out to the}} middle. Ganguly was the unenviable {{possessor}} of a batting average of below 30 in Australia, and his weakness at handling the short delivery was only too well-documented. Therefore, there were some suggestions that Ganguly would drop himself down the order to no.6, so as to delay facing the Australian pacemen as much as possible. [...] His first scoring shot was a streaky shot between gully and third slip, which brought him three runs. Then he played the odd shot outside the off-stump, but other than a few risky fours, there was nothing to suggest that he would fail. Ganguly then drove Andy Bichel between cover and mid-off for another boundary. This proved to be the integral part of his innings as he was decidedly more at ease and runs started to flow from his bat. Previously, on India's tour of England in 2002, he stroked a 128, which had a lot of unorthodox shots and some savage hitting. This innings, though, seemed to have reclaimed the majesty and beauty that Ganguly's batting had been known for. His footwork was noted to be the most intriguing part of his stay at the wicket. He did not move his feet exaggeratedly during his innings and unfurled a huge variety of strokes {{towards the end of the}} innings, without once breaking the momentum he had set. He also left the balls that <b>were</b> <b>way</b> outside the off-stump and his defense grew progressively secure and certain. He handled the short ball extremely well too, slapping them away, or ducking safely. There was superb timing and placement written all over his trademark off-side shots. In fact, Ganguly's innings provoked humorous comments from the fans who suggested that his superb strokes were a result of him dining at the Taj Mahal restaurant, whose owner was a spectator.|$|E
