500|$|The {{failure of}} Stiffelio (attributable not {{least to the}} censors of the time taking offence at the taboo subject of the {{supposed}} adultery of a clergyman's wife and interfering with the text and roles) incited Verdi to take pains to rework it, although even in the completely recycled version of Aroldo (1857) it still failed to please. Rigoletto, with its intended murder of royalty, and its sordid attributes, also upset the censors. Verdi would not compromise: <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> sack matter to the police? Are they worried about the effect it will produce?...Do they think they know better than I?...I see the hero has been made no longer ugly and hunchbacked!! Why? [...] A singing hunchback...why not?...I think it splendid to show this character as outwardly deformed and ridiculous, and inwardly passionate and full of love. I chose the subject for these very qualities...if they are removed I can no longer set it to music.|$|E

2500|$|An early {{reference}} to isopsephy, albeit of more-than-usual sophistication (employing multiplication rather than addition), {{is from the}} mathematician Apollonius of Perga, writing in the 3rd century BC.

[...] More conventional are the instances of isopsephy found in graffiti at Pompeii, dating from around 79 AD. One reads Φιλω ης αριθμος ϕμε, [...] "I love her whose number is 545."

2500|$|Once the untranslatables {{have been}} set aside, the {{problems}} for a translator, especially of Chinese poetry, are two: [...] <b>What</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> translator think the poetic line says? [...] And once he thinks he understands it, how can he render it into the target language? [...] Most of the difficulties, according to Link, arise in addressing the second problem, [...] "where the impossibility of perfect answers spawns endless debate." [...] Almost always at the center is the letter-versus-spirit dilemma. [...] At the literalist extreme, efforts are made to dissect every conceivable detail about {{the language of the}} original Chinese poem. [...] "The dissection, though," [...] writes Link, [...] "normally does to the art of a poem approximately what the scalpel of an anatomy instructor does to the life of a frog." ...|$|E

[...] But Rabbi Nehemiah explained that it was because “they are one people, and they have all one language,” that they rebelled against God. [...] Rabbi Abba bar Kahana taught that God gave them an opportunity to repent, for the words “and now” in [...] indicate repentance, for [...] says, “And now, Israel, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> Lord your God require of you, but to fear the Lord your God.” But the next word of [...] “No,” reports their response.
