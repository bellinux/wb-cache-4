5000|$|The {{earliest}} known {{audio tape}} recorder was a non-magnetic, non-electric version invented by Alexander Graham Bell's Volta Laboratory and patented in 1886 (...) [...] It employed a 3/16 in strip of wax-covered paper that was coated by dipping it {{in a solution}} of beeswax and paraffin and then had one side scraped clean, with the other side allowed to harden. The machine was of sturdy wood and metal construction, and hand-powered {{by means of a}} knob fastened to the flywheel. The <b>wax</b> <b>strip</b> passed from one eight-inch reel around the periphery of a pulley (with guide flanges) mounted above the V-pulleys on the main vertical shaft, where it came in contact with either its recording or playback stylus. The tape was then taken up on the other reel. The sharp recording stylus, actuated by a vibrating mica diaphragm, cut the wax from the strip. In playback mode, a dull, loosely mounted stylus, attached to a rubber diaphragm, carried the reproduced sounds through an ear tube to its listener.|$|E

5000|$|French waxing (sometimes {{called a}} landing strip or a partial Brazilian wax) leaves a {{vertical}} strip of pubic hair about 1.5 in wide and 3 in long {{just above the}} vulva. Hair around the anus area and labia may be removed. The landing <b>strip</b> <b>wax</b> has become popular with models who must wear garments of an extreme narrowness in the crotch region.

50|$|Stripless wax (as {{opposed to}} <b>strip</b> <b>wax),</b> also {{referred}} to as hard wax, is applied somewhat thickly and with no cloth or paper <b>strips.</b> The <b>wax</b> then hardens when it cools, thus allowing the easy removal by a therapist without the aid of cloths. This waxing method is very beneficial to people who have sensitive skin. Stripless wax does not adhere to the skin as much as <b>strip</b> <b>wax</b> does, thus making it a good option for sensitive skin as finer hairs are more easily removed because the hard wax encapsulates the hair as it hardens. The stripless waxing method can also be less painful.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The use of {{different}} materials and techniques {{has been studied}} to decide the safest quantum of reduction of the occlusal surfaces. However, these methods provide limited information as to the actual amount of reduction with limitations in accuracy, accessibility and complexity. Objective: The objective {{of this study was}} to compare and evaluate the reliability of the most commonly used occlusal registration wax that with polyether bite registration material as a guide for occlusal reduction required during tooth preparations. Materials and Methods: For the purpose of this study, 25 abutment teeth requiring tooth preparation for fixed prosthesis were selected and tooth preparations carried out. Modeling <b>wax</b> <b>strips</b> of specific dimensions were placed onto the cast of prepared tooth, which was mounted on maximum intercuspation on the articulator and the articulator was closed. The thickness of the wax registration was measured at three zones namely two functional cusps and central fossa. Similar measurements were made using the polyether bite registration material and prosthesis at the same zones. The data was tabulated and was subjected to statistical analysis using anova test and Tukey honestly significant difference test. Results: The differences in thickness between wax record and prosthesis by 0. 1346 mm, whereas the difference between polyether and prosthesis was 0. 02 mm with a P value of 0. 042, which is statistically significant. This means that the wax record was 8. 25 % larger than the prosthesis while polyether was just 1. 27 % larger than the prosthesis. Conclusion: The clinical significance of the above analysis is that Ramitec polyether bite registration material is most suitable material when compared with commonly used modeling wax during the tooth preparation...|$|R

40|$|The {{sounds of}} buzzing {{electric}} clippers echoed around The University of Notre Dame Australia’s Prindiville Hall as brave staff and {{students from the}} Fremantle Campus shaved, coloured and waxed their hair for the Leukaemia Foundation’s World’s Greatest Shave. Fourth year Health and Physical Education student Michael Brinsden joined five other team members on Wednesday, 18 April, to raise awareness about blood cancer and much needed funds for cancer research. Mr Brinsden’s team raised more than $ 2000 for the Leukaemia Foundation. Health and Physical Education Lecturer Rob Merrells volunteered to have both his head shaved and legs waxed for the occasion. Mr Merrells signed up {{in support of his}} younger sister Jess who was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in 2009. He raised more than $ 650 for the cause. Fremantle Dockers’ utility Matt de Boer also offered his assistance during the shave, swapping the Sherrin football for a <b>waxing</b> <b>strip</b> to remove the hair from Notre Dame student Kane Mitchell. “Today was about raising awareness of cancer in the university community,” Mr Brinsden said. “The take home message from the World’s Greatest Shave event at Notre Dame was ‘the six degrees of separation’. If cancer doesn’t affect us directly, then there is a strong possibility that we have a friend or family member who has been affected. ” The money raised from the World’s Greatest Shave funds free services to support patients and their families, including information, emotional care and accommodation for regional Western Australians required to move closer to city hospitals for cancer treatment. It also funds vital research into the treatment and prevention of blood cancer. Notre Dame students coordinated the event as part of the Heath Promotion unit in the School of Health Sciences.

40|$|The aims of {{the work}} this thesis is based upon were to develop {{convenient}} analytical procedures for determining resin acids in biological and environmental matrices, and apply them to enhance understanding of the occurrence, exposure to and uptake by exposed individuals of resin acids. Particular {{focus has been on}} the workplace environment of the Swedish wood pellets industry. Sample extraction procedures and high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry (HPLC/ESI-MS) methodologies were developed for measuring resin acids in dust, skin and urine samples. Chromatographic separation of abietic (AA) and pimaric acid was achieved by using a polar-embedded C 12 stationary phase. The HPLC/ESI-MS method avoids undesirable oxidation of AA, which was found to occur during the derivatisation step in the standard MDHS 83 / 2 gas chromatography/flame ionisation detection (GC/FID) methodology, leading to false observations of both AA and the oxidation product 7 -oxodehydroabietic acid (7 -OXO). Personal exposures to resin acids in the Swedish wood pellet production industry were found to be lower, on average, than the British Occupational Exposure Limit for rosin (50 µg/m 3). The oxidised resin acid 7 -OXO, was detected in both dust and skin samples indicating the presence of allergenic resin acids. A correlation between air and post-shift urinary concentrations of dehydroabietic acid (DHAA), and a trend towards an increase in urinary 7 -OXO during work shifts, were also observed. Whether the increase in 7 -OXO was due to direct uptake or metabolism of other resin acids cannot be concluded from the results. An efficient HPLC/UV methodology with diode-array detection was developed for screening commercial products for rosin {{that could be used in}} laboratories lacking mass spectrometers. Very high concentrations of free resin acids were detected in depilatory <b>wax</b> <b>strips</b> using the method.

40|$|Pesticides {{remain a}} {{necessary}} component of many agricultural systems and used judiciously {{they can play}} an important role in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programmes. The aim of the present study was to investigate factors influencing the differential toxicity of insecticides against a cosmopolitan insect pest of crucifer crops, the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, and its respective hymenopteran parasitoid, Cotesia vestalis. Such knowledge can help in the effective use of insecticides with biological control agents in IPM. Three insecticides regarded as being compatible with some natural enemies (abamectin, spinosad, indoxacarb) and a compound generally regarded as harmful to natural enemies (lambda-cyhalothrin) were examined. Similar tests were also carried out with the peach potato aphid Myzus persicae and its parasitoid Aphidius colemani due to the loss of the Cotesia vestalis culture. A comparative measure of the intrinsic toxicity of fresh deposits (Day 0) of insecticides on Chinese cabbage was determined for both pest and parasitoid species. Lambda-cyhalothrin and abamectin were the most toxic compounds against both pests and their parasitoids, while indoxacarb and spinosad were less toxic. Residual bioassays were conducted using sprayed plants maintained under glasshouse conditions for 0 - 28 days after insecticide application. Results indicated lambda-cyhalothrin was the most persistent compound and abamectin and spinosad the least persistent. A leaf <b>wax</b> <b>stripping</b> technique was used with bioassays to compare the distribution of insecticide residues between the epicuticular wax layer and underlying leaf tissues. Wax removal significantly reduced the toxicity of all insecticides. No-choice and choice behavioural assays were conducted for both parasitoid species with leaf discs treated with LC 5 and LC 50 levels of insecticides. Both parasitoids tended to avoid insecticide-treated leaves, giving preference to untreated leaves or the arena. Emergence of adult parasitoids from cocoons/mummies on insecticide-treated leaves was not significantly different from untreated controls. The results are discussed in terms of the bioavailability of insecticides to phytophagous and non-phytophagous insect species. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|In {{contemporary}} western society, {{digital and}} social media and advertising are everywhere, making information circulating {{at the speed}} of light. Although the amount of messages is enormous, the ideals –especially regarding beauty- represented within these messages are often very homogeneous and limiting (e. g. regarding skin colour, sexuality, weight, etcetera). Within advertising campaigns, a company not only promotes its products, it also constructs a brand and company identity, and often contributes to a well-accepted norm within society (Killbourne, 2010). In February 2014, Veet launched the Don’t Risk Dudeness campaign, a collection of advertisements that promoted the brand’s <b>wax</b> <b>strips.</b> The message of these advertisements was downright simple: having the tiniest feel of stubble makes a woman feel and look like a man. The norm that these advertisements underline is that it is socially acceptable for men to have body hair, but not for women. Or, in other words, the Don’t Risk Dudeness campaign, along with other advertisements and media output, help to construct a specific part of the contemporary female gender identity; namely in order to be feminine a hairless body is the norm. Moreover, the message implies that women should feel ashamed and guilty when they fail to achieve this hairless beauty standard (Burke, 2012; Killbourne, 2010; Lesnik-Oberstein, 2006). This article aims to analyse the Don’t Risk Dudeness advertisements of Veet in all of its aspects. Using a textual analysis, embedded with the cultural studies tradition of the active audience paradigm, the content of the advertisements is studied, along with the reactions of both the online YouTube audience and the marketing team behind the campaign. A brief historical overview of hair removal shows that in other western and non-western, ancient yet also contemporary contexts the practice of hair removal is applied to both genders. However, the body hair removal that is talked about in Veet’s case, is only applied to one gender – feminine- and therefore, {{there is no longer a}} matter of distinction between two or more classes: it is a way of policing women’s bodies. Therefore we argue that “research into women’s personal grooming habits is, in many ways the study of inequality – particularly the internalisation of the notion that a women’s body is imperfect unless it is somehow modified” (Burke, 2012). status: publishe...|$|R
