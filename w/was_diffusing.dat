The Tuscarora was one of those noble-looking warriors oftener met with among the aborigines of this continent a century since than to-day; and, while he had mingled sufficiently with the colonists to be familiar with their habits and even with their language, he had lost little, if any, of the wild grandeur and simple dignity of a chief. Between him and the old seaman the intercourse had been friendly, but distant; for the Indian had been too much accustomed to mingle with the officers of the different military posts he had frequented not to understand that his present companion was only a subordinate. So imposing, indeed, had been the quiet superiority of the Tuscarora's reserve, that Charles Cap, for so was the seaman named, in his most dogmatical or facetious moments, had not ventured on familiarity in an intercourse which had now lasted more than a week. The sight of the curling smoke, however, had struck the latter like the sudden appearance of a sail at sea; and, {{for the first time since}} they met, he ventured to touch the warrior, as has been related.|$|E

30|$|The {{curve of}} J q shows a {{positive}} flux of the 2 -CP into activated carbon from 0 to 11  days. The J q showed a maximum {{value in the}} beginning of the test, because biofilm growth was negligible and the diffusion resistance was minimal. The J q decreased as 2 -CP started to accumulate inside the activated carbon, thus lowering the concentration gradient at the exterior surface of activated carbon. The most important point was that at 11  days, the flux changed from a positive value to a negative value. A positive J q means 2 -CP <b>was</b> <b>diffusing</b> from biofilm into activated carbon, while a negative J q means 2 -CP <b>was</b> <b>diffusing</b> from activated carbon into biofilm. This required a reversal of the concentration profile inside the activated carbon. The resulting negative concentration gradient caused the 2 -CP to diffuse out of the activated carbon for a bioregeneration start. As the biofilm accumulated to grow thicker, the resistance to the diffusion of 2 -CP became larger, and the biofilm degraded 2 -CP to lower 2 -CP concentration at biofilm-carbon interface. The 2 -CP concentration continued to decrease to a level where the equivalent surface concentration in the activated carbon was lower than the equilibrium with previously adsorbed 2 -CP. A reversal in the concentration profile was then established. At this point, 2 -CP simply diffused out of the activated carbon and activated carbon was bioregeneratd by the biofilm.|$|E

30|$|As can {{be derived}} from this study, the {{acclimatization}} strategy seems {{to play an important role}} in successful treatment of toxic compounds such as 2 -CP. Acclimation to the biodegradation of approximately 10  mg L− 1 of 2 -CP was possible within less than 10  days. The removal efficiency increased considerably with successive feedings. The acclimated sludge could be used as an inoculum for an anaerobic BAC reactor to achieve high 2 -CP removal efficiency under continuous-flow condition. The mathematical model system was derived to describe the adsorption and biodegradation of 2 -CP by 2 -CP degrading bacteria in BAC process. The completely mixed, packed-bed BAC process was conducted to validate the model. The experimental data and model simulation in effluent concentration of 2 -CP agreed well with each other. The 2 -CP flux across the biofilm–carbon interface quantitatively illustrated bioregeneration rate. Concentration profiles of 2 -CP in the activated carbon showed a complete reversal as 2 -CP <b>was</b> <b>diffusing</b> out of the activated carbon during the period of bioregeneration. Biofilm bioregenerated the activated carbon by lowering the 2 -CP concentration at the biofilm-activated carbon interface as the biofilm grew thicker. The 2 -CP previously adsorbed inside the activated carbon simply desorbed out of the activated carbon through a reversal of the concentration profile in the activated carbon. The experimental data and model simulation in effluent concentrations of 2 -CP and suspended biomass agreed well with each other. The results of this study can be applied to aid the design and operation of the biological activated carbon process.|$|E

40|$|Sickle cell disease (SCD) {{is caused}} by an {{inherited}} mutation in hemoglobin that leads to sickle hemoglobin (HbS) polymerization and premature HbS denaturation. Previous publications have shown that HbS denaturation is followed by binding of denatured HbS (a. k. a. hemichromes) to band 3, the consequent clustering of band 3 in {{the plane of the}} erythrocyte membrane that in turn promotes binding of autologous antibodies to the clustered band 3, and removal of the antibody-coated erythrocytes from circulation. Although each step of the above process has been individually demonstrated, the fraction of band 3 that is altered by association with denatured HbS has never been determined. For this purpose, we evaluated the lateral diffusion of band 3 in normal cells, reversibly sickled cells (RSC), irreversibly sickled cells (ISC), and hemoglobin SC erythrocytes (HbSC) in order to estimate the fraction of band 3 that <b>was</b> <b>diffusing</b> more slowly due to hemichrome-induced clustering. We labeled fewer than ten band 3 molecules per intact erythrocyte with a quantum dot to avoid perturbing membrane structure and we then monitored band 3 lateral diffusion by single particle tracking. We report here that the size of the slowly diffusing population of band 3 increases in the sequence: normal cells<HbSC<RSC<ISC. We also demonstrate that the size of the compartment in which band 3 is free to diffuse decreases roughly in the same order, with band 3 diffusing in two compartments of sizes 35 and 71 nm in normal cells, but only a single compartment in HbSC cells (58 nm), RSC (45 nm) and ISC (36 nm). These data suggest that the mobility of band 3 is increasingly constrained during SCD progression, suggesting a global impact of the mutated hemoglobin on erythrocyte membrane properties...|$|E

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThe {{effect of}} pore water {{chemistry}} on the mechanical strength of chalk has been thoroughly investigated {{during the last}} years. Recent studies have demonstrated precipitation of new minerals that further triggers dissolution and increased deformation of chalk matrix when exposed to certain brines at reservoir temperatures. However, to detect these newly formed minerals and further localize the areas of precipitation by analyzing SEM (scanning electron microscopy) images, {{have proved to be}} a time-consuming and complicated process. Until now, most research have been carried out on intact chalk cores while only minor attention have been devoted to study fractured cores. In this thesis, high porosity outcrop chalk from Mons was tested experimentally in triaxial cells - both fractured and intact. The temperature was kept at a constant value of 130 °C (similar to reservoir conditions) and the cores were flooded with different types of brines; either synthetic seawater (SSW) or magnesium chloride (0. 219 M MgCl 2). Two mechanical tests were conducted; hydrostatic and creep, and effluent water was collected during this whole testing period. By analyzing the amount of ions present in the effluent made it possible to confirm if the injected brine <b>was</b> <b>diffusing</b> into the matrix, and not only through the fracture itself. SEM images would further support the overall observations provided from the experimental results. The experimental work showed that the fractures did not have any remarkable effect on the mechanical strength during hydrostatic loading, were all cores were flooded with 0. 657 M NaCl. The small differences that occurred however, are most likely caused by variations in porosity values rather than the fractures. Also during the first 6 days of creep, it was continued to flood with 0. 657 M NaCl and all the cores witnessed of relatively similar behaviors, with a reduction in strain rate and further development of transient creep phase. When the flooding brines were substituted, more distinct observations could be seen. The cores flooded with SSW experienced the highest deformation rates despite that one core contained a fracture whereas the other one was intact, but the latter had a somewhat higher value when comparing the two. Similar behaviors were observed for the cores flooded with 0. 219 M MgCl 2, as the intact core had a slightly higher deformation rate. The reason for the increased deformation rate observed for the intact cores, was suggested to be a result of the core matrix being immediately contacted by the flooding fluid. For the cores containing fractures, the brine would spend longer time to diffuse into the matrix and hence deform the chalk core. Chemical analysis of the effluent water have shown that magnesium is lost within the core in addition to calcium production, both for the fractured and intact cores when flooded with SSW and 0. 219 M MgCl 2. SEM images from one of the fractured cores also detected clay like minerals in the hole’s wall and {{it was clear that the}} grain structure had been altered. Images from further out in the core exterior on the other hand, had cleaner grain surface as it was possible to see the coccolith rings...|$|E

40|$|More than a {{metric ton}} {{of water is}} transported to the International Space Station (ISS) each year to provide {{breathing}} oxygen for the astronauts. Water is a safe and compact form of stored oxygen. The water is electrolyzed on ISS and ambient pressure oxygen is delivered to the cabin. A much smaller amount of oxygen is used each year in spacesuits to conduct Extra Vehicular Activities (EVAs). Space suits need high pressure (> 1000 psia) high purity oxygen (must meet Aviator Breathing Oxygen "ABO" specifications, > 99. 5 % O 2). The water / water electrolysis system cannot directly provide high pressure, high purity oxygen, so oxygen for EVAs is transported to ISS in high pressure gas tanks. The tanks are relatively large and heavy, {{and the majority of}} the system launch weight is for the tanks and not the oxygen. Extracting high purity oxygen from cabin air and mechanically compressing the oxygen might enable on-board production of EVA grade oxygen using the existing water / water electrolysis system. This capability might also benefit human spaceflight missions, where oxygen for EVAs could be stored in the form of water, and converted into high pressure oxygen on-demand. Cerium oxide solid electrolyte-based ion transport membranes have been shown to separate oxygen from air, and a supported monolithic wafer form of the CeO 2 electrolyte membrane has been shown to deliver oxygen at pressures greater than 300 psia. These supported monolithic wafers can withstand high pressure differentials even though the membrane is very thin, because the ion transport membrane is supported on both sides (Fig 1). The monolithic supported wafers have six distinct layers, each with matched coefficients of thermal expansion. The wafers are assembled into a cell stack which allows easy air flow across the wafers, uniform current distribution, and uniform current density (Fig 2). The oxygen separation is reported to be "infinitely selective" to oxygen [1] with reported purity of 99. 99 % [2]. Combined with a mechanical compressor, a Solid Electrolyte Oxygen Separator (SEOS) should be capable of producing ABO grade oxygen at pressures > 2400 psia, on the space station. Feasibility tests using a SEOS integrated with a mechanical compressor identified an unexpected contaminant in the oxygen: water vapour was found in the oxygen product, sometimes at concentrations higher than 40 ppm (the ABO limit for water vapour is 7 ppm). If solid electrolyte membranes are really "infinitely selective" to oxygen as they are reported to be, where did the water come from? If water is getting into the oxygen, what other contaminants might get into the oxygen? Microscopic analyses of wafers, welds, and oxygen delivery tubes were performed in an attempt to find the source of the water vapour contamination. Hot and cold pressure decay tests were performed. Measurements of water vapour as a function of O 2 delivery rate, O 2 delivery pressure, and process air humidity levels were the most instructive in finding the source of water contamination (Fig 3). Water contamination was directly affected by oxygen delivery rate (doubling the oxygen production rate cut the water level in half). Water was affected by process air humidity levels and delivery pressure in a way that indicates the water <b>was</b> <b>diffusing</b> into the oxygen delivery system...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of several {{processing}} parameters on the production of PZT and lead titanate nanostructures, by two different synthesis routes. The first aimed to produce freestanding, nanoscale PZT crystals via a simple, hydrothermal technique. Phase-pure, 52 : 48 PZT was synthesised within 2 hr at 160 °C in a hydrothermal autoclave. The morphology of the resultant crystals was cubic and micron-sized. Efforts were thus directed at reducing crystal size, by altering several processing conditions. Reaction time and temperature {{were found to have}} little effect on crystal size and instead resulted in incomplete reaction below the threshold values shown above. Introducing a 100 % excess of Pb precursor led to an improvement in the faceting of the crystals, but again did not lead to a change in average crystal size. However, by using a 2 % solution of the surfactant Triton-X, the average crystal size fell from 5 μm to 2 μm. The use of anatase TiO 2 in the general hydrothermal procedure imposed a lower limit on the mineraliser concentration that was necessary for dissolution to occur. To overcome this restriction, a hybrid sol-gel/hydrothermal technique was attempted. This had the unexpected result of producing pyramidal microfibres that tapered to nano-sized points. Since the attempts to synthesise freestanding, nanoscale PZT crystals using the hydrothermal method were unsuccessful, work focussed on growing nanoislands on single crystal (100) - SrTiO 3 substrates. Heteroepitaxial PZT films up to 1 μm thick, as well as micro- and nanoislands were observed, after extended 24 hr reactions at 160 °C. In some cases, the islands appeared to nucleate along scratches in the SrTiO 3 substrate, leading to the formation of microwires up to a millimetre in length. Ferroelectric analysis of the microwires by PFM revealed them to be weakly piezoelectric. The second synthesis route to nanoscale ferroelectrics relied upon the solid phase reaction between Pb and Ti thin films to produce lead titanate. The optimum condition for the crystallisation of the perovskite phase was found to be 1 hr at 650 °C, under an air atmosphere. However, examination of the film morphology revealed large distortions and blistering across the surface. As such, {{it was not possible to}} acquire polarisation loop measurements, due to shorting between the top and bottom electrodes. EDAX confirmed that PbO vapour from the film <b>was</b> <b>diffusing</b> into the Si substrate leading to the formation of voids and the production of lead silicate glasses. Alternative adhesion layers for the Pt back electrodes were investigated, in an attempt to limit the diffusion of PbO. Electrical measurements on the films were made possible by substituting Zr for Ti. However, the shape of the hysteresis loops corresponded to a lossy dielectric as opposed to a ferroelectric response from the film. Films annealed on alternative substrates also suffered from blistering, but without the intrusion of PbO. This result suggested that the distortion present in the films was not as a consequence of the interaction between volatile species and the substrate. Instead, blistering and delamination was attributed to stresses generated during the transformation into the PbTiO 3 perovskite phase. The solid phase synthesis method was extended to produce PbTiO 3 nanoislands by utilising flash thermal evaporations. Deposition times below 1 s resulted in Pb nanoislands with a size range of 5 – 30 nm. Annealing the nanoislands under the same regime as used during the thin film experiments led to the loss of their morphology through melting. To overcome this problem an extended low temperature annealing was adopted. PFM was conducted on various nanoisland and thin film samples produced by the in situ technique. Nanoisland samples subjected to prolonged conventional annealings at 300 °C and brief hot plate annealings at 550 °C exhibited a non-zero piezoresponse. Definitive evidence of ferroelectricity in the nanoisland samples could not be demonstrated, however, as attempts to pole them were unsuccessful. PbTiO 3 thin films produced by annealing Pb/Ti bilayers displayed clear c+ and c- ferroelectric domains that were mostly pinned by the grain boundaries. Little evidence of self-polarisation was found, since the average piezoresponse across the image was close to zero. Localised poling resulted in piezoresponse images showing the presence of intermediate contrast. This was interpreted as partial, 90 ° switching or evidence for “tail-to-tail” domain structure formation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
