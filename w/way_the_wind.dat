500|$|... 1986's Walk the <b>Way</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> Blows was, {{according}} to Allmusic, [...] "her breakthrough both critically and commercially". Four singles were {{released from the}} album. First was [...] "Love at the Five and Dime", originally recorded by Nanci Griffith on her 1986 album The Last of the True Believers. Following it were [...] "Walk the <b>Way</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> Blows", [...] "You're the Power", and [...] "Train of Memories". All four of these songs reached the top 10 of the country music charts between 1986 and 1987. The B-side to [...] "You're the Power" [...] was a rendition of [...] "Song for the Life", written by Rodney Crowell and later a top 10 hit for Alan Jackson in 1995. Contributing musicians on Walk the <b>Way</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> Blows included Béla Fleck, Don Williams (who sang background vocals on [...] "Love at the Five and Dime"), Wendy Waldman, and Vince Gill. Billboard praised Walk the <b>Way</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> Blows as [...] "Mattea's most country effort to date". An uncredited review in Stereo Review (now Sound & Vision) stated that [...] "if every country album were as tasteful and well executed as Walk the <b>Way</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> Blows...the reviewer's life would be a happy one indeed", while rating the performance and recording as [...] "perfection". Thom Jurek felt that the album's uptempo cuts were stronger than its ballads, noting that [...] "Her ballad singing hadn't gotten to the place it did just three years later" [...] while praising her performances on the more upbeat tracks and on [...] "Love at the Five and Dime".|$|E
500|$|Dylan earned {{yet another}} {{distinction}} in a 2007 study of US legal opinions and briefs that found his lyrics were quoted by judges and lawyers {{more than those}} of any other songwriter, 186 times versus 74 by the Beatles, who were second. Among those quoting Dylan were US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia, both conservatives. The most widely cited lines included [...] "you don't need a weatherman to know which <b>way</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> blows" [...] from [...] "Subterranean Homesick Blues" [...] and [...] "when you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose" [...] from [...] "Like a Rolling Stone".|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at TTG Studios {{at the corner}} of Sunset and Highland in Hollywood, California, between March 9 and March 12, 1966. Some songs, such as [...] "Motherly Love" [...] and [...] "I Ain't Got No Heart" [...] had already been recorded before the Freak Out! sessions. These early recordings, said to have been made around 1965, were not officially released until 2004, when they appeared on the posthumous Zappa album Joe's Corsage. An early version of the song [...] "Any <b>Way</b> <b>The</b> <b>Wind</b> Blows", recorded in 1963, appears on another posthumous release, The Lost Episodes. The song was written when Zappa considered divorcing first wife Kay Sherman. In the liner notes for Freak Out!, Zappa wrote, [...] "If I had never gotten divorced, this piece of trivial nonsense would never have been recorded." ...|$|E

500|$|After Fram was {{anchored}} to ice in an inlet in the south-eastern {{corner of the}} Bay, Amundsen selected a site for the expedition's main hut, [...] from the ship. Six teams of dogs were used to move supplies to the site, as work on erecting the hut began. Bjaaland and Stubberud laid the foundations deep into the ice, levelling the sloping ground. Because the prevailing winds came from the east, the hut was erected on an east-west axis, with the door facing west; in this <b>way</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> caught only the shorter eastern wall. The roof was in place by 21January, and six days later the hut was complete. By then a large supply of meat—including 200seals—had {{been brought to the}} base, for use by the shore party and to be laid in depots before the journey to the pole. The base was dubbed Framheim, [...] "the home of Fram".|$|E
500|$|Biographer Robert Shelton {{wrote that}} in the early 1970s, Dylan was {{frequently}} criticized for [...] "selling out" [...] and that people were pressuring him {{to go back to his}} earlier trend of composing protest songs. For Shelton, who noted the promotional photo for [...] "Watching the River Flow" [...] depicting Dylan looking through a camera, the track expressed Dylan's wish just to be an observer, and not a political activist. Author Seth Rogovoy similarly interpreted the song as Dylan's desire to ignore politics and avoid getting involved in people's disputes. The line [...] " [...] keeps on rollin', though/No matter ... which <b>way</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> does blow" [...] has been heard by writers Peter Vernezze and Carl J. Porter as evidence of Dylan's conviction that [...] "the river of time, the flow of facts, in reality remains unaffected by winds of beliefs, the flow of changing opinions." ...|$|E
500|$|Between 1977 and 1989 Home was Governor of I Zingari, the nomadic cricket team. In {{retirement}} {{he published}} three books: [...] The <b>Way</b> <b>The</b> <b>Wind</b> Blows (1976), described by Hurd as [...] "a good-natured autobiography, with perhaps more anecdotes than insights", Border Reflections (1979), and his correspondence with his grandson Matthew Darby, Letters to a Grandson (1983). In the 1980s Home increasingly {{spent his time}} in Scotland, with his family. He was a keen fisherman and enjoyed shooting. Hurd writes that [...] "there was no sudden moment when he abandoned politics", rather that [...] "his interventions became fewer and fewer". His last speech in the House of Lords was in 1989, when he spoke against Hurd's proposals for prosecuting war criminals living in Britain: [...] "After such a lapse of time justice might not {{be seen to be}} done. It would be dangerous to rely on memories of events that occurred so long ago. It was too late to reopen the issue." [...] His withdrawal from public affairs became more marked {{after the death of his}} wife in 1990, after 54 years of marriage.|$|E

500|$|The {{first two}} songs {{recorded}} for the album were [...] "Any <b>Way</b> <b>The</b> <b>Wind</b> Blows" [...] and [...] "Who Are the Brain Police?" [...] When Tom Wilson heard the latter, {{he realized that}} The Mothers were not merely a blues band. In The Real Frank Zappa Book, Zappa wrote [...] "I {{could see through the}} window that he was scrambling toward the phone to call his boss—probably saying: 'Well, uh, not exactly a [...] "white blues band", but... sort of.'" [...] In a 1968 article written for Hit Parader magazine, Zappa wrote that when Wilson heard these songs, [...] "he was so impressed he got on the phone and called New York, and as a result I got a more or less unlimited budget to do this monstrosity." [...] Freak Out! is an early example of the concept album, a sardonic farce about rock music and America. [...] "All the songs on it were about something", Zappa wrote in The Real Frank Zappa Book. [...] "It wasn't as if we had a hit single and we needed to build some filler around it. Each tune had a function within an overall satirical concept." ...|$|E
500|$|Mattea had {{her first}} No.1 single in late 1987 to early 1988 with [...] "Goin' Gone". Co-written by Pat Alger and Fred Koller, this song also {{previously}} appeared on The Last of the True Believers. Mattea's version was the lead single to her third album Untasted Honey. Following it was [...] "Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses", which became her longest-tenured No.1 single when it spent two weeks in that position. [...] "Untold Stories" [...] and [...] "Life as We Knew It" [...] were also released from the album. Also included was [...] "The Battle Hymn of Love", featuring duet vocals from Tim O'Brien, who also wrote [...] "Walk the <b>Way</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wind</b> Blows" [...] and [...] "Untold Stories". Jurek noted the album's bluegrass influences with favor, while comparing [...] "Untold Stories" [...] {{to the work of}} Bill Monroe and praising Mattea's storytelling on [...] "Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses". People magazine's review of the album stated that [...] "it’s just Mattea, sounding warm, strong, smart and generally splendid," [...] while praising the lyrics of [...] "Life as We Knew It" [...] and [...] "Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses".|$|E
500|$|... "Denial" [...] is a midtempo Europop {{song with}} {{elements}} of soft rock. Its instrumentation {{is provided by}} a guitar, a keyboard, drums and synthesizers. The song contains {{a sample of the}} bass hook from [...] "Standing in the Way of Control" [...] by The Gossip. Kim Dawson of the Daily Star compared the song's bassline to that featured in [...] "One Minute", a song from Kelly Clarkson's album My December. The opening of [...] "Denial" [...] is evocative of David Bowie's song [...] "Fashion", although it soon transitions into the sound of songs performed by Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue. [...] "Denial" [...] is composed of soft rock staccato verses, which are proceeded by a melancholic and harmonious pop chorus. Digital Spy's Nick Levine commented upon the song's compositional transition, writing: [...] "'Denial' rides its elastic bassline to a transcendent, melodically-inspired chorus". The group's harmonies are backed by warm synthesizers and 1980s soft rock music. The song contains a solo middle eight performed by group member Heidi Range, and is opened with the line [...] "I see the <b>way</b> <b>the</b> <b>wind</b> blows like open minds for us". [...] "Denial" [...] explores themes of unrequited love, as noted by Peter Murphy from Hot Press.|$|E
