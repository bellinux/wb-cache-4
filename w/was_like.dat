5|$|I didn't {{even know}} the project was coming out. I didn't know what the beat was for; I just knew Eminem asked me for the files and I sent it to them.... When I saw Eminem in L.A. for Grammy weekend, Eminem said, 'Yeah, he ripped the track.' Later on that day, I met Royce, and Royce <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'Yeah, {{download}} that track man. We ripped that track. That's the first single.' I <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'What?' But until then, I still wasn't sure.|$|E
5|$|I {{was sitting}} there in the theater at the back, showing it to people for the first time. I mean, it <b>was</b> <b>like</b> a puddle of sweat around my feet. It <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'Oh my God, oh my God, I hope I did the right thing. Oh, that scene is too long. Oh, that's too short. Are they going to get this part? Are they going to like this? Oh, they're going to think it's boring!' Just {{worrying}} the whole way, biting my fingernails off.|$|E
5|$|It was {{a little}} strange. And {{definitely}} when I {{walked down the aisle}} I <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'This is kind of creepy — there’s some other man standing there!' It was really beautiful. People were all really excited like it was really my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and I <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'Mom, it's a video. This is not my dress. This is not the real wedding.' But I think it’s just one of those moments that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E

5|$|When I got {{the call}} , I <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'I don't know if that's me. She <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'Nah, it's gonna be your type of beat.' I'm like, 'Oh, for real?' Then when Hov called he said, 'I'm gonna do it with you.' I <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> 'Dag, this is big.' But when I did it, I kept it me and kept it 'hood. At first I ain't think she was gonna like it but she called and said she loved it. From there it was a wrap. That's history. Mariah is known for doing remixes with street cats from Mobb Deep to O.D.B., so {{to be a part}} of that was a good look for me and the Def Jam movement.|$|E
5|$|A {{large stone}} {{windmill}} {{was built on}} a hill by late 1686, doubling as a watch tower over the Ottawa River, the Lake of Two Mountains and {{the mouth of the}} Des Prairies River.

5|$|Amin Hajee as Bagha (batsman), {{the mute}} drummer. Hajee earlier {{worked in a}} film with Ashutosh. The {{friendly}} association brought Ashutosh to him with the script, which he liked, and thereafter he successfully auditioned for his role. His knowledge of mute people and some assistance from a music band helped him better prepare for his role. Ashutosh, who believed that Amin <b>was</b> <b>like</b> Sylvester Stallone, would refer to him as Stallone during filming.|$|E

5000|$|Argument 4. (132c-133a) Socrates now {{suggests}} that the Forms are patterns in nature (παραδείγματα paradeigmata [...] "paradigms") of which the many instances are copies or likenesses.

Yet if things <b>are</b> <b>like,</b> then they come to <b>be</b> <b>like</b> by participating in Likeness; therefore Likeness <b>is</b> <b>like</b> the likeness in concrete things, and another regress is generated.|$|R

5|$|Harvey {{also noted}} that the fatwa covered a wide range of Islamic {{religious}} duties, while usually a responsum fatwa only addresses a specific enquiry on a difficult point of detail. The fatwa also went into specific practical challenges faced by Muslims in Spain, such as the pressure to curse Muhammad, eat pork, drink wine, and intermarry with the Christians. This suggests that the author had some knowledge of what life under Christian rule <b>was</b> <b>like.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this article}} I {{distinguish}} {{the notion of}} there being something it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> {{a certain kind of}} creature from that of there being something it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to have a certain kind of experience. Work on consciousness has typically dealt with the latter while employing the language of the former. I propose several ways of analyzing what it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> a certain kind of creature and find problems with them all. The upshot is that even if there is something it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to have certain kinds of experience, it does not follow that there is anything it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> a certain kind of creature. Skepticism about the existence of something that it <b>is</b> <b>like</b> to <b>be</b> an F is recommended...|$|R

The badge was royal blue, while the letter gold. These colours were later used by the Parramatta Eels at their introduction in the NSWRL premiership in 1947, although there was no official affiliation between Cumberland and the later Parramatta team.
