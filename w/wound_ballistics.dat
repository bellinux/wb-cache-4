To {{investigate}} the wounding effects in human {{on the basis}} of the similarity theory, by taking the temporary cavity as the research object, through the analysis on the forming of cavity and its physical process, main influencing factors effecting temporary cavity are obtained, which can provide a good theoretical basis for similarity research in <b>wounding</b> <b>ballistics</b> in the future, and the killing effect of the high speed steel ball is more deeply described...|$|R
50|$|On July 6, 2009, {{police were}} called to a {{burglary}} in progress in Dallas, North Carolina, {{a small town in}} the northern portion of Gaston County. Eyewitnesses reported seeing a vehicle matching the description of the murder suspect's Ford Explorer outside an apparently abandoned house. Upon arrival, police spoke with Burris, who gave a fake name. Officer Williamson was able to figure out the true identity of the subject and found he was wanted for a probation violation. The three officers, Williamson, Shaw and Kuzia entered the house. During the arrest, Officer Kuzia tased Burris and he pulled out a small handgun and fired, shooting Shaw in the upper thigh. The officers returned fire and fatally <b>wounded</b> Burris. <b>Ballistics</b> tests, as well as checks on the suspect's vehicle, later proved the dead gunman to be Burris. Investigators are now trying to determine if Burris is responsible for more murders.|$|R
50|$|Forensics uses {{a variety}} of {{different}} tools and techniques. Fingerprint collection through the use of grey or black magnetic powder. DNA and other bodily fluids are collected and, whether it is hair or fluid, for further examination in a lab. Shoe and tire prints can be collected using dental stone. Electronics are taken for examination by a technical expert to search for further evidence. Documents from the area are also taken for further examination. Ammunition and weapons are taken for matching to <b>wounds</b> and <b>ballistics.</b> Photographs of tool marks are taken because they can be matched to a weapon at a later time. Any other trace evidence is also collected. Trace evidence is anything left behind by a perpetrator or could have been transferred to the perpetrator. Interviews of both witnesses and victims of the crime are taken by law enforcement officials in order to gain knowledge and creating a timeline of events.|$|R

Since that time, other authors suggest there is increasing evidence to support the theory that shock waves from high velocity bullets can cause tissue related damage and damage to the nervous system. This has been shown in various experiments using simulant models 48.

50|$|Further {{evidence}} gathered {{suggested to}} the Commission {{that the initial}} April consensus that a separate bullet caused the governor’s wrist and thigh injuries was incorrect, as the Army <b>Wound</b> <b>Ballistics</b> experts concluded that those wounds were “not caused by a pristine bullet,” and therefore bullet CE 399 “could have caused all his wounds.” Other evidence, such as the nature of Connally’s back wound (see below) was also cited by the Commission as corroborating the theory.|$|E
50|$|The first {{shooting}} {{which brought}} critical media attention to Black Talon was by Gian Luigi Ferri, who used Black Talon and other ammunition to shoot 15 {{people at a}} San Francisco law office in 1993; nine of whom died (the 101 California Street shootings). Physician Boyd Stevens, the San Francisco Medical Examiner who performed the autopsies, later reported at the 1994 International <b>Wound</b> <b>Ballistics</b> Association's conference in Sacramento that the wound trauma caused by Black Talons was unremarkable and that all victims died due to penetration of a vital structure.|$|E

50|$|According to Dr. Martin Fackler and the International <b>Wound</b> <b>Ballistics</b> Association (IWBA), between 12.5 and 14 inches (318 and 356 mm) of {{penetration}} in calibrated tissue simulant is optimal {{performance for}} a bullet which {{is meant to}} be used defensively, against a human adversary. They also believe that penetration {{is one of the most}} important factors when choosing a bullet (and that the number one factor is shot placement). If the bullet penetrates less than their guidelines, it is inadequate, and if it penetrates more, it is still satisfactory though not optimal. The FBI's penetration requirement is very similar at 12 to 18 inches (305 to 457 mm).|$|E
50|$|Because this {{conclusion}} {{appeared to be}} inconsistent with the backward motion of the President's head in the Zapruder film, the committee consulted a <b>wound</b> <b>ballistics</b> expert to determine what relationship, if any, exists between the direction from which a bullet strikes the head and subsequent head movement. The expert concluded that nerve damage from a bullet entering the President's head could have caused his back muscles to tighten which, in turn, could have forced his head {{to move toward the}} rear. He demonstrated the phenomenon in a filmed experiment which involved the shooting of goats. Thus, the committee determined that the rearward movement of the President's head would not be fundamentally inconsistent with a bullet striking from the rear.|$|E

50|$|Many tricks {{done with}} thrown cards are {{designed}} to not only impress with the magician's dexterity, but work on a common theme in stage magic: the illusion of danger. While the illusion of danger {{can be achieved by}} outright deception, another method is to play on people's popular misconceptions. In the case of card throwing, the magician achieves this effect by throwing the card at fragile targets such as newspaper, cigarettes, fruit, hot dogs, foam, or any other substance that the card will easily imbed in or break. While none of these objects act like human tissue in terms of <b>wound</b> <b>ballistics,</b> the magician is counting on most audience members thinking they actually are comparable, and therefore believing he or she has turned a harmless playing card into a deadly projectile.|$|E
50|$|Ballistic gelatin is {{a testing}} medium scientifically {{correlated}} to swine muscle tissue (which {{in turn is}} comparable to human muscle tissue), in which the effects of bullet wounds can be simulated. It was developed and improved by Martin Fackler {{and others in the}} field of <b>wound</b> <b>ballistics.</b> Ballistic gelatin is a solution of gelatin powder in water. Ballistic gelatin closely simulates the density and viscosity of human and animal muscle tissue, and is used as a standardized medium for testing the terminal performance of firearms ammunition. While ballistic gelatin does not model the structure of the body, including skin and bones, it works fairly well as an approximation of tissue and provides similar performance for most ballistics testing. Ballistic gelatin is used rather than actual muscle tissue due to the ability to carefully control the properties of the gelatin, which allows consistent and reliable comparison of terminal ballistics.|$|E

40|$|Ballistics {{involves}} {{the study of}} the scientific properties of projectiles, their behavior and their terminal effects on biological tissues and other materials. <b>Wound</b> <b>ballistics</b> deals with the analysis of injuries caused by projectiles and the behavior of projectiles within human or other biological tissues. The nineteenth century witnessed the development of both of these areas with Kocher’s hydrodynamic theory and the understanding of the significance of bullet deformation in causing tissue injury. The degree of traumatic disruption of tissues and organs was also related to direct energy transfer from projectiles. While subsequent research has concentrated on elucidating further mechanisms of injury, the exact cause of remote tissue damage from high energy projectiles is still the subject of ongoing research. Much of the contemporary literature regarding <b>wound</b> <b>ballistics</b> concentrates on the forensic aspects and their application for legal purposes, in particular the investigation of shooting scenes.
