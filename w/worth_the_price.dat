If Ray (or his successor) later decides to gate off the driveway and prevent Joe (or Joe's successor) from accessing the driveway, a court would likely find an easement by estoppel.|$|E
25|$|In Epilogue, {{optional}} downloadable content (DLC), it {{is shown}} that the Prince and Elika survive, and retreat to an underground palace. Elika leaves the Prince. However, they both end up battling Elika's father once again. They escape, and attempt to leave the palace alive. While on their way, Elika shows her frustration with the Prince multiple times, believing bringing her back was not <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of the evil it unleashed. The Prince counters that by freeing her, they 'stand a chance' against Ahriman. In a final battle against Elika's father, the Prince defeats him by impaling him on spikes, a visual reference to the original Prince of Persia game. In the end, Elika leaves the Prince to search for her people, and the Prince is left alone with a bloodthirsty Ahriman seeking revenge.|$|E

25|$|A unique Astre {{package was}} offered in 1975. Dubbed the 'Lil Wide Track, {{it was the}} {{creation}} of Jerry Juska of Dymar to help with lackluster Astre sales. Juska took his ideas to Dave Landrith of Motortown Corporation specializing in custom auto work. The package includes a front air dam, rear spoiler, appliance wire mag rims, window louvers, a chrome exhaust tip, and bright stripe decals for the hood, body sides, rear spoiler, door handles, and wheel centers. They assembled a couple of cars in Jan. and Feb. 1975 and took pictures to local Detroit dealers where the package gained acceptance. It added a little over $400 to the price of the Astre but dealers felt the difference in looks was <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>price.</b> Production was later switched from an old warehouse in suburban Detroit to a factory beside the Lordstown Assembly Vega/Astre plant. An estimated 3,000 Lil Wide Track Astres were ordered by dealerships. The package components were later offered as a dealer installed kit.|$|E

[...] Brian Linder of IGN described This Is It as a [...] "freshly designed" [...] release of a greatest hits album, and that the album's tracks of an all-vocal arrangement of [...] "Beat It" [...] was [...] "particularly awesome" [...] and the acoustic version of [...] "She's Out of My Life" [...] allows Jackson's [...] "vocals to shine without the distraction of dated '70s musical underpinnings."

500|$|Ninja Gaiden II was {{reviewed}} in the July1990 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly and received very high ratings. Steve Harris {{said that the}} game improved on its predecessor's gameplay, graphics, and cinematic cutscenes; he praised the diverse level environments and the new abilities that Ryu has received, but he noted that some power-ups from the first Ninja Gaiden game were missing in this one. A reviewer under the pseudonym [...] "Sushi-X" [...] echoed Harris' praise but pointed about {{that some of the}} bosses in the first game were reused; he added afterwards that [...] "it's still <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of admission". Ed Semrad called Ninja GaidenII one of the best video game sequels to ever be released; he referred to the graphics, difficulty, gameplay, and storyline as [...] "near-perfect", though he points out that the game does get very difficult in the latter levels. Martin Alessi called it one of the best NES games ever {{and one of the best}} video games of 1990. In the same issue, Ninja GaidenII was featured on the front cover and was denoted as the [...] "Game-of-the-Month". The game received further praise for taking the Ninja Gaiden series to new levels and featuring other surprises. They showed a partial walkthrough of the first Act and provided short tips for the second through fourth Acts. Near the end of the feature the staff pointed out rumors of a third installment to the series (which would eventually become [...] ).

500|$|Gosling {{played an}} {{introvert}} who {{falls in love}} with a sex doll in the 2007 film Lars and the Real Girl. He drew inspiration from James Stewart's performance in Harvey. Roger Ebert felt [...] "a film about a life-sized love doll" [...] had been turned into [...] "a life-affirming statement of hope" [...] because of [...] "a performance by Ryan Gosling that says things that cannot be said". Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post described his performance as [...] "a small miracle ... because he changes and grows so imperceptibly before our eyes." [...] However, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt [...] "the performance is a rare miscalculation in a mostly brilliant career." [...] He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. The film was a box office failure, failing to recoup its $12 million production budget. Gosling starred opposite Anthony Hopkins in the 2007 courtroom thriller Fracture. He originally turned down the role, but changed his mind when Hopkins signed on. Gosling noted that he was drawn to his character, Willie, because he had flaws and seemed like a real person. He spent time shadowing lawyers and observing courtroom proceedings in preparation for the role. Claudia Puig of USA Today declared that [...] "watching a veteran like Hopkins verbally joust with one of the best young actors in Hollywood is <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of admission". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt it was a treat to watch [...] "the spectacle of that crafty scene stealer Anthony Hopkins mixing it up with that equally cunning screen nibbler Ryan Gosling ... Each actor is playing a pulp type rather than a fully formed individual, but both fill in the blanks with an alchemical mix of professional and personal charisma." [...] The film grossed over $91 million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|In January 1945, McGovern used R time to {{see every}} sight that he could in Rome, and to {{participate}} in an audience with the Pope. Bad weather prevented many missions from being carried out during the winter, and during such downtime McGovern spent much time reading and discussing how the war had come about. He resolved that if he survived it, he would become a history professor. In February, McGovern was promoted to First Lieutenant. On March 14, McGovern had an incident over Austria in which he accidentally bombed a family farmhouse when a jammed bomb inadvertently released above the structure and destroyed it, an event which haunted McGovern. (Four decades later, after a McGovern public appearance in that country, the owner of the farm approached the media to let the Senator know that he was the victim of that incident but that no one had been hurt and the farmer felt that it had been <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> if that event helped achieve the defeat of Nazi Germany in some small way. McGovern was greatly relieved.) On returning to base from the flight, McGovern was told his first child Ann had been born four days earlier. April 25 saw McGovern's 35thmission, which marked fulfillment of the Fifteenth Air Force's requirement for a combat tour, against heavily defended Linz. The sky turned black and red with flak – McGovern later said [...] "Hell can't be any worse than that" [...] – and the Dakota Queen was hit multiple times, resulting in 110holes in its fuselage and wings and an inoperative hydraulic system. McGovern's waist gunner was injured, and his flight engineer was so unnerved by his experience that he would subsequently be hospitalized with battle fatigue, but McGovern managed to bring back the plane safely with the assistance of an improvised landing technique.|$|E
