Dynamic loads and load effects in the gearbox are obtained by two dynamic models; a simplified approach and Multi Body Simulation (MBS) method. A good agreement between these two methods is observed. The long-term fatigue damage is then calculated based on the SN-curve approach by considering all short-term damages and the long-term wind speed distribution.

2500|$|<b>Winding</b> <b>gear</b> is the {{mechanism}} which allows paddles {{to be lifted}} (opened) or lowered (closed). Typically, a square-section stub emerges from the housing of the <b>winding</b> <b>gear.</b> This is the axle of a sprocket ("pinion") which engages with a toothed bar ("rack") attached by rodding {{to the top of}} the paddle. A lock-keeper or member of the boat's shore crew engages the square socket of their windlass (see below) onto the end of the axle and turns the windlass perhaps a dozen times. This rotates the pinion and lifts the paddle. A pawl engages with the rack to prevent the paddle from dropping inadvertently while being raised, and to keep it raised when the windlass is removed, so that the operator can attend to other paddles. Nowadays it is considered discourteous and wasteful of water to leave a paddle open after a boat has left the lock, but in commercial days it was normal practice. To lower a paddle the pawl must be disengaged and the paddle wound down with the windlass. Dropping paddles by knocking the pawl off can cause damage to {{the mechanism}}; the paddle gear is typically made of cast iron and can shatter or crack when dropped from a height. In areas where water-wastage due to vandalism is a problem, (for example the Birmingham Canal Navigations), paddle mechanisms are commonly fitted with vandal-proof locks (nowadays rebranded [...] "water conservation devices") which require the boater to employ a key before the paddle can be lifted. The keys are officially known as [...] "water conservation keys", but boaters usually refer to them as T-keys, from their shape; handcuff keys because the original locks, fitted on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, resembled handcuffs; Leeds and Liverpool Keys after that canal; or simply Anti-Vandal Keys.|$|E

Economics also played a part: the rods needed for pumping could be used for this extra function at little increased cost.

2500|$|Coal {{is found}} {{outcropping}} {{to the east}} of Towers Road, which corresponds to the line of the Red Rock Fault at the surface. The earliest record to be found is a lease dated 28 February 1589, which talks of the [...] "Coal pit at Wourthe lately occupied by George Finche". This could be worked on the surface then by shallow shafts, and later by deeper shafts with waterwheels or steam engines operating pumps and <b>winding</b> <b>gear.</b> In the late 18th century, the Warrens of Poynton co-operated with the Leghs of Lyme to work the Cannel and Sheepwash seams at Norbury Hollow. Initially, the mines were pumped using waterwheels driven by the Norbury Brook; atmospheric steam engines were then used and then condensing engines thus allowing deeper pits to be sunk. Output in 1789 was over 23,586 tonnes (26,000 tons) rising to a production of 221,056 tonnes (243,673 tons) in 1859, an amount believed unlikely to have been surpassed. The Poynton Collieries were substantial, and the coal rights were held by the Warren family who leased them the Wrights and the Claytons. The canal and new roads and railway lines were used to remove the coal. In 1826, the estate passed to George John Venables Vernon, 4th Lord Vernon who decided in 1832 to manage the mines himself. In 1856 it was estimated that there was a reserve of 15,163,027 tons which would supply 245,000 tons for 61 years. This was to be supplied by the Park Round Pit, and the Park Oval Pit both working the Four Foot and Five Foot Seam and the Anson Pit and the Nelson Pit which were working the Accommodation Seam. The pits had good transport links to their principal markets, cotton mills around Manchester. With the Lancashire Cotton Famine, in 1861 and the subsequent recession, the price of coal collapsed, the output dropped 112,840 tons, leading to worker redundancies. A new shaft, the Lawrance Pit, was sunk at Park, in 1885 raising the output to 216,362 tons and paying for itself within a year. However the costs were rising and the closure of the Norbury Pits resulted in a constant ingress of water. In 1926 production was down to 80,146 tons. The 1926 General strike lasted for 17 weeks in Poynton and the men went back to work as the collieries would have closed due to the cost of pumping. The collieries closed on 30 August 1935; 250 men were made redundant. 80 were offered jobs in the Kent coalfield and some secured employment with Avro at Woodford. The Anson Colliery is now the site of the Anson Engine Museum, all other shafts have been capped and Park Pit has been levelled.|$|E

A test matrix that represents the ranges of contact conditions of the <b>wind</b> turbine <b>gear</b> boxes was defined and executed to bring an empirical understanding to the micro-pitting problem in terms of key contact parameters and operating conditions. On the theoretical side, the first deterministic micro-pitting model based on a mixed elastohydrodynamic lubrication formulations and multi-axial near-surface crack initiation model was developed. This physics-based model includes actual instantaneous asperity contacts associated with real surface roughness profiles for predicting the onset of the micro-pit formation. The predictions from the theoretical model were compared to the experimental data for validation of the models. The close agreement between the model and measurements was demonstrated.
