5000|$|The current Aerotrike series {{comprises}} two {{variants of}} the same basic design, the Scout and Cobra. Both share the same basic design, including the two-seat carriage frame, suspension, steering and folding inverted [...] "V" [...] mast assembly. The Scout is equipped minimally, while the Cobra has many options as standard equipment, including a cockpit pod fairing, <b>windshield,</b> instrument <b>panel,</b> saddle bags and wheel pants.|$|R
50|$|As a {{consequence}} of their size, school buses {{have a number of}} blind spots, which endanger passengers disembarking the bus and pedestrians standing or walking nearby. This safety challenge is addressed by improving the design and configuration of the bus windows, <b>windshield,</b> body <b>panels,</b> and mirrors in order to maximize visibility. In the case of an accident, the body structure of a school bus is designed with an integral roll cage along with a number of emergency exits to facilitate fast egress. Controversy exists over the use of seat belts as a restraint system for school bus passengers; officials of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board state school buses are safer than private automobiles even if they are not fitted with seat belts.|$|R
50|$|Automodello {{vehicles}} are finely detailed, especially their 1:8 scale reproductions which can cost thousands of dollars. Still, even their smaller offerings are intricate. The Cunningham C-3, for example, can be displayed with soft top or top boot. Its carpet is flocked and wire wheels have deeply laser cut spokes (McCourt 2014a, p. 16). Only 154 of the Cunninghams {{were made by}} Automodello. The Avanti R2 offered in 1:43 scale was likewise detailed with accurate <b>windshield</b> wipers, instrument <b>panel</b> and rubber bumper tips (McCourt 2014b, p. 15).|$|R
5000|$|Introduced in 1956 as a {{sub-series}} of the {{top level}} DeSoto Fireflite series, the Adventurer was originally marketed as a limited production two-door hardtop, and available in a white/black/gold color scheme only. The first Adventurer came with a hi-output 341 cubic inch Hemi V8, dual exhausts and custom appointments and trim. Standard trim included dual outside side mirrors, gold wheel covers, radio, electric clock, padded instrument <b>panel,</b> <b>windshield</b> washers, full instrumentation, [...] and heavy duty suspension. A total of 996 cars were sold in its first year.|$|R
25|$|Standard {{convenience}} features {{included a}} custom luxury steering wheel, column-mounted manual shifter, woodgrain dashboard trim, inside hood release, individual reclining front seats with adjustable headrests, center folding arm rest, fixed two-point seatbelts, two-speed electric wipers, electric washers integrated to the wiper arms, 140km/h speedometer, courtesy lights, monaural AM radio {{with a single}} in-dash speaker, electric analog clock, heater with windshield defroster, lighter, dashboard ashtray, locking glove box, tinted <b>windshield,</b> plastic door <b>panels</b> with cloth insert and pull strap, dual rear ashtrays, folding down rear bench seat, trunk carpet, sound-insulating cardboard-type headliner (U.S. base model type), and round dome light.|$|R
5000|$|The all-new GMT900 {{generation}} of the Silverado/Sierra arrived {{in the last quarter}} of 2006 as a 2007 model. It features a redesigned exterior, interior, frame, and suspension as well as a power increases on certain engines. It takes styling cues from the 2007 GMT900 SUVs and the Chevrolet Colorado pickups. Like the GMT900 SUVs, these pickups also have greatly improved aerodynamics over their predecessors like steeply raked <b>windshields</b> and tighter <b>panel</b> gaps which improve fuel economy. The GMT800 models were continued through 2007 badged as [...] "Classic", just as the GMT400 models continued for two years after the GMT800's introduction.|$|R
5000|$|Chapter 3 {{documents}} {{the history of}} crash science focusing on {{the effect on the}} human body (the second collision) as it collides with the interior of the car as the car hits another object (the first collision). Nader says that much knowledge was available to designers by the early 1960s but it was largely ignored within the American automotive industry. There are in-depth discussions about the steering assembly, instrument <b>panel,</b> <b>windshield,</b> passenger restraint, and the passenger compartment (which included everything from door strength to roll-over bars). Due to this, the [...] "Nader bolt" [...] was installed to reinforce the door and suicide doors were discontinued {{because of a lack of}} door strength.|$|R
40|$|There {{were two}} primary {{objectives}} of the research effort reported herein. The first objective was to identify and evaluate noise source/path identification technology applicable to single engine propeller driven aircraft {{that can be used}} to identify interior noise sources originating from structure-borne engine/propeller vibration, airborne propeller transmission, airborne engine exhaust noise, and engine case radiation. The approach taken to identify the contributions of each of these possible sources was first to conduct a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of an in-flight noise and vibration database acquired on a Cessna Model 182 E aircraft. The second objective was to develop and evaluate advanced technology for noise source ranking of interior panel groups such as the aircraft <b>windshield,</b> instrument <b>panel,</b> firewall, and door/window panels within the cabin of a single engine propeller driven aircraft. The technology employed was that of Acoustic Holography (AH). AH was applied to the test aircraft by acquiring a series of in-flight microphone array measurements within the aircraft cabin and correlating the measurements via PCA. The source contributions of the various panel groups leading to the array measurements were then synthesized by solving the inverse problem using the boundary element model...|$|R
50|$|Following {{the success}} of the 2009 Honda XRE300, Yamaha {{introduced}} the Ténéré to fill the empty market niche. Virtually the same as the Lander, it differs in its adventure approach, having a 16L tank instead of 11, with larger fairings; independent chassis-mounted headlight piece with <b>windshield</b> and display <b>panel</b> (leaving the handlebar lighter); the suspension course is a 20 mm shorter in both ends; the seat is sectioned for a more comfortable longer ride to both driver and pillion; 2 headlights, both considerably brighter than Lander's; lower handlebar position; and front fenders closer to the wheel. It was available in white, black, light blue, sand, dark blue, red and grey, with varying graphics.Its design was heavily influenced by the Japanese/European XT 1200Z Super Ténéré.|$|R
40|$|Transparent {{electronics}} is {{an emerging}} {{science and technology}} field concentrates on producing ‘invisible’ electronics circuit and optoelectronics devices. The application contains consumer electronics such as automobile <b>windshield,</b> transparent solar <b>panel,</b> transparent display and real time wearable display. In the conventional Si/III-V based electronics, the structure is based on semiconductor junction & transistor. However, the basic building material for transparent electronic devices {{which is to be}} transparent and in visible range is a true challenge!. Therefore to understand and implement such technology there are two scientific goals, to have a material which are optically transparent and electrically conductive and to implement an invisible circuitry. Development of such invisible transparent electronic devices needs expertise together from pure and applied science, material science, chemistry, physics &electronic science...|$|R
5000|$|The {{removable}} roof {{consists of two}} carbon fiber panels, weighing 6 kg each, which required the reinforcement of the rear pillar {{to compensate for the}} loss of structural integrity as well as to accommodate the rollover protection and ventilation systems for the engine. The panels are easily removable and are stored in the front luggage compartment. The Aventador Roadster has a unique engine cover design and an attachable wind deflector to improve cabin airflow at high speed as well as a gloss black finish in the A-pillars, <b>windshield</b> header, roof <b>panels,</b> and rear window area. The car has a [...] base price. With a total weight of 1625 kg it's only 50 kg heavier than the coupé (the weight of the roof, plus additional stiffening in the sills and A-pillars).|$|R
40|$|The roll-to-roll (R 2 R) {{platform}} is an industrial vetted {{way to handle}} solution-based processes and coatings for high volume manufacturing. R 2 R processes are implemented for applications as diverse as instant photographic film, separation membranes, filtration media, advance printing and holographic coatings, polymer anti-shatter films for car <b>windshields,</b> flexible solar <b>panels,</b> composite electrodes on metal foils for lithium-ion batteries, and macroscale patterning of metal interconnects for flexible packaging of electronic components. Currently, manufacturers are looking for new innovative continuous-feed processes for printing materials and structures onto roll-based flexible substrates. In particular there is considerable interest in adapting R 2 R technologies for the extreme miniaturization of critical feature sizes to the nanoscale. This intersection of nanofabrication with R 2 R processes has considerable potential to spur innovation and economic growth. Nanofabrication for R 2 R process platforms represents a disruptive manufacturing technology involving solution-processed, multi-layer precision coatings with functionalized nanostructures, materials, and patterning capability to realize unprecedented properties and functionalities for next generation consumer products. Commercial products and applications impacted by this approach include displays, lighting, energy storage, electronics, solar photovoltaics. These high-value consumer electronics predicted to see double-digit market growth beyond the next decade (IDTechEx 2009 - 2029 Market Report). Incorporation of emerging nanofabrication methods within R 2 R manufacturing processes {{will make it possible}} to economically generate high value-added technology products at meters-per-minute rates on plastic film, paper, or foil, achieving feature dimensions as small as ten nanometers over areas encompassing billions of identical devices. Meeting this challenge is a key to high-rate manufacturing of nano-enabled products and for establishing viable industrial-scale manufacturing platforms for continuous large-area roll-to-roll processing...|$|R
5000|$|The 1934 Model 355D was {{completely}} restyled and mounted on {{an entirely new}} chassis but used the same engine as in 1933. The Model 355 was divided into three series, the Series 10, 20 and 30. Bodies on the Series 10 and 20 were built by Fisher and on the Series 30 by Fleetwood. The bodies on the Series 30 were shared with the Cadillac V-12 and V-16. Styling emphasized streamlining, including concealment of all chassis features except the wheels. Body construction was improved for better insulation against engine heat and reduction of engine, road and wind noise. Bumpers were a stylish but ineffective biplane design, mounted against telescoping springs. The grille was V-shaped and sloping, set into a painted shell. Although restricted use of chrome was {{a feature of the}} overall ornamentation, a chrome plated radiator shell was available as an option. Horns and radiator filler cap were concealed under the hood. Teardrop Guide Multibeam headlights were mounted on streamlined supports attached to the fenders. Parking lamps were mounted on the headlight supports. Airfoil shaped fenders were brought low over the chassis. The hood sills were high with the entire fender shape molded into the radiator shell. A curious horizontal crease broke the nose contour of the fenders. Hoods extending nearly to the windshield carried shutter-type louvers in the side <b>panel.</b> <b>Windshields</b> were fixed and steeply sloping; 18 degrees on Fisher bodies, 25 degrees flat or a 29.5 degree V on Fleetwood bodies. Cowl vents opened toward the windshield; one vent on flat windshield bodies, two vents projecting through openings in the hood on V-shaped windshield bodies. Bodies were 2.0 in lower than on previous models. Added passenger space in the front compartment was achieved by moving the hand brake lever {{to the left of the}} driver, under the instrument panel. Rear fenders were airfoil shaped and carried rear lights that matched the headlights. The gas tank filler was on the left side at the rear of the body, on Fleetwood bodies in the left rear fender. All bodies featured beaver tail deck that completely covered the chassis. On Fleetwood bodies the spare was concealed under the rear deck, unless optional fender mounts were specified. Independent front suspension was introduced, called [...] "knee-action". Engine horsepower increased to 120.|$|R
