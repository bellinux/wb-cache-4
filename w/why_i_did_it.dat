[...] By 2004, however, he had {{admitted to the}} BBC the difficulty of explaining his decision. [...] "It's a hard one to explain to your kids and it doesn't get any easier. I wish I could explain <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> so people would understand." ...|$|E

A film of the event – Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid – was taken on tour, with Drummond and Cauty discussing the incineration {{with members of the}} public after each screening. In 2004 Drummond admitted to the BBC that he now regretted burning the money. [...] "It's a hard one to explain to your kids and it doesn't get any easier.

2500|$|The album gained media {{attention}} for its explicit themes and exploration of homosexuality, suggested as a [...] "queer-studies thesis." [...] Singapore law officials banned the album {{due to its}} lyrics supporting homosexuality. [...] "Free Xone" [...] speaks of gay, lesbian and bisexual pairings, as Jackson protests discrimination. [...] "Together Again" [...] recalls a departed friend lost to AIDS. Her cover of Rod Stewart's [...] "Tonight's the Night" [...] suggests losing her virginity to another woman, also alluding to bisexuality. Media attention led Stewart to announce [...] "that's an original song by Janet Jackson" [...] when performed in concerts. In response to criticism, Jackson said, [...] "I {{have a lot of}} gay friends, men and women, and that's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> I knew people would say I was gay, and I didn't care." [...] She also stated, [...] "I caught a lot of hell for that... religious groups have been upset with me for certain songs on the album, but it’s not going to stop me from writing what I feel inside." [...] Media reports of Jackson involved in intimate relationships with dancers Tina Landon and Shawnette Heard surfaced following its release, although denied.|$|E

40|$|In {{this vision}} paper I will discuss a few {{questions}} concerning the use of generative processes in composition and automatic music creation. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> and <b>does</b> <b>it</b> really work? <b>I</b> discuss the problems involved, focusing {{on the use of}} interactivity, and describe the use of interactive evolution as a way of introducing interactivity in composition.

60|$|At {{the same}} moment he seized a light {{hen-coop}} and tossed it overboard, and the mate {{did the same with}} an oar in the twinkling of an eye.

60|$|It was {{the most}} unmeaning and purposeless murder imaginable.
