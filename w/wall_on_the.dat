5|$|Growth {{was much}} slower in the east, and the modest {{extensions}} {{on this side}} were separated from the much larger extensions in the west by the marshy open area of Moorfields adjacent to the <b>wall</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> north side which discouraged development in that direction.|$|E
5|$|The present {{building}} is designed on a triangular plan. The large tower {{at the tip}} of the triangle is the medieval gatehouse, from which wings extend on either side. An isolated tower that now has the library on two floors divides the curtain <b>wall</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east.|$|E
5|$|In {{relation}} to the structure itself, the inner city is notable for the audience hall, which is an important representation of Serbian medieval architecture. High in the stone <b>wall</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Danube side, four sets of double-arched windows are carved in a combination of Gothic and Romanesque styles. This is where a merchant contract between the Republic of Venice and the Serbian Despotate was signed.|$|E

5|$|Sinclair, Norton, Stirling and Cally {{escape to}} a fallout shelter {{entrance}} on horseback. They locate an underground {{facility in the}} forest and find an intact 2007 Bentley Continental GT, which they fuel up. Kane's medieval knights arrive and kill Norton. Sinclair and the others drive the Bentley back to the quarantine <b>wall.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> way, they are intercepted by Sol's gang, who seeks to avenge Viper's death. After a high-speed chase, Sol {{and many of his}} men are killed and Sinclair's group escape.|$|E
5|$|The British {{attacked}} {{the position of}} the 3rd Continentals, and an engagement ensued. Both sides kept up constant fire, the Americans breaking the British lines several times. However, after 17 volleys, the British numbers began to overwhelm the Americans, and Glover ordered a withdrawal to another stone <b>wall</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> crest of a hill while the next regiment in line, the 26th Continentals, engaged the British.|$|E
5|$|The main <b>wall</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sea-facing side of Dubrovnik {{stretches}} from Fort Bokar {{in the west}} to St. John Fortress in the south, and to the Revelin Fortress on the land-side. These walls are 1.5 to 5 meters (5–16feet) thick, depending on their location and its strategic importance. The purpose of these walls were to help defend the city from sea-based attacks, particularly from the Republic of Venice, which was often considered a threat to Dubrovnik's safety.|$|E

5|$|The {{most famous}} {{project of the}} Mycenaean era was the network of roads in the Peloponnese. This appears to have {{facilitated}} the speedy deployment of troops—for example, {{the remnants of a}} Mycenaean road, along with what {{appears to have been a}} Mycenaean defensive <b>wall</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Isthmus of Corinth. The Mycenaean era saw the zenith of infrastructure engineering in Greece, and this appears not to have been limited to the Argive plain.|$|E
5|$|The new plaza {{created in}} 1967 {{is used for}} worship and public gatherings, {{including}} Bar mitzvah celebrations and the swearing-in ceremonies of newly full-fledged soldiers in the Israel Defense Forces. Tens of thousands of Jews flock to the <b>wall</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Jewish holidays, and particularly on the fast of Tisha B'Av, which marks {{the destruction of the}} Temple and on Jerusalem Day, which commemorates the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967 and the delivery of the Wall into Jewish hands.|$|E
5|$|The site {{on which}} the SIS {{building}} stands had been {{the location of the}} Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens in the 19th century. Several industrial buildings were subsequently built on the site after the demolition of the pleasure gardens in the 1850s, including a glass factory, a vinegar works and a gin distillery. Archeological excavation of the site during building found the remains of seventeenth century glass kilns, as well as barge houses and an inn called The Vine. Evidence was also found for a river <b>wall</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site.|$|E

5|$|The south transept, {{formerly}} the parish church of StOswald contains a piscina and sedilia {{in the south}} <b>wall.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> east wall are four chapels, each with a reredos, two of which were designed by Giles Gilbert Scott, one by Kempe and the other by his successor, W.E.Tower. The south window is dated 1887 and was made by Heaton, Butler and Bayne to a design by R.C.Hussey. Other stained glass in the transept is by Clayton and Bell, by C.E.Kempe and by Powell.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{is built}} into the rear <b>wall,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forts southern side. This room is set into the end of the rampart and was used to prepare gunpowder charges. A guardhouse was built at the manning parade's southern end in 1885. It is now used as a duty room for the drill squad during recreation demonstrations but originally was a guard's room and separate cells connected by telephone to Fort Largs. Up to three men appear to have been accommodated in the guard's room. When the fort was converted to use as a caravan park the guard house was converted to an ablution block. A store and ablution block were also built in 1885 between the stockade and rear defence wall.|$|E
5|$|During the Anglo-Saxon period, Worcester {{first became}} {{the capital of}} the Hwicce kingdom, and later formed part of the wider kingdom of Mercia. Worcester and its defences were reorganised by Ealdorman Æthelred and Æthelflæd and bishop Werferth in the 890s. This {{involved}} creating a burh, a fortified Anglo-Saxon town; in Worcester this took the form of a planned settlement, extending out from the old Roman defences, with the Shambles forming a street running along the <b>wall</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east. Archaeological evidence suggests that the burh had 4,650 feet (1,417 m) of walls in total; documentary evidence from the Burghal Hidage document, written shortly after the creation of the walls, suggests they were 4,960 feet (1,512 m) long, a discrepancy that may be accounted for by changes {{in the course of the}} river since the 10th century. The walls incorporated the old Roman fortifications on the south and south-east side of the city and appear to have included a defensive ditch, with a revetment supporting a wooden palisade.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} two episodes, it is {{revealed}} that Wirt and Greg are actually two boys from the modern era. Wirt and Greg's strange appearance {{stems from the fact}} that the night they entered the Unknown was Halloween. Wirt, attempting to take back an embarrassing poetry tape he made for a girl he likes, had followed her to a graveyard scary story gathering before a police officer scared him and Greg into jumping over the cemetery's garden <b>wall.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other side of the wall, they landed on train tracks where Greg was almost hit by a train. Wirt pushed them both off a hill into a lake/river in an attempt to save him, knocking them both unconscious in the process and sending them to a Limbo-like realm between life and death.|$|E
5|$|Later, Stottlemeyer and Disher {{watch the}} film's {{shooting}} and Natalie's prediction is right: Ruskin has impersonated Monk {{to the point}} that he is unable to complete the sequence because he is hassled by the setting's disorder. He leaves the studio, goes to Monk's house to know what are his reasons to do his job, and explores Monk's files on Trudy's murder, grieving Monk. An afflicted Monk goes to Natalie's house, where he solves the case when he sees torn paper by Julie to prevent Natalie from reading it. The pawnshop is adjacent to a restaurant, where clients are drawn on the <b>wall.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> crime's night, Leverett and Cullman were sketched and Leverett tried to destroy the evidence.|$|E
5|$|One of Greer Stadium's most {{distinctive}} features was its guitar-shaped scoreboard. After First Tennessee Park was approved, the team {{announced it would}} not be relocating the original Greer scoreboard, which was technologically outdated and difficult to maintain, to the new stadium. While plans for First Tennessee Park's scoreboard were initially undisclosed, following overwhelming support for Greer's guitar from the community, the team announced plans for a larger, more modern guitar-shaped scoreboard for the new ballpark. The new guitar scoreboard, paid for entirely by the Sounds, was designed by TS Sports in conjunction with Panasonic, and was installed beyond the right-center field <b>wall</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> concourse.|$|E

5|$|Stanaway drifted at La Rascasse corner {{after his}} car's {{rear-end}} gave way and narrowly avoided hitting the <b>wall</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> race's final lap. He regained {{control of his}} car and crossed the start/finish line to win the race. Marciello finished second, two seconds behind the race winner and Sirotkin took third. Canamasas secured fourth, and Leal was fifth. Pic, Rossi and Vandoorne filled the remainder of the points-scoring positions and were all separated by 2.5 seconds. Yelloly and Gasly rounded out the top ten. Lynn, de Jong, Vișoiu, Markelov and Berthon followed in the next five places, while Binder, Negrão, Stöckinger, Matushita, Sørensen and Nato were the last of the classified finishers. The victory was Stanaway's first in the GP2 Series and the maiden triumph for his team Status Grand Prix following its take over of the former Caterham Racing entry. Stanaway's victory was the best success for a New Zealand driver at Monaco since Denny Hulme won the 1967 Monaco Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|The British waited half an {{hour before}} attacking again. This time when they {{attacked}}, they attacked with all 4,000 men and seven cannon. The British bombarded the American position behind the stone wall as their infantry advanced. The cannon fire was ineffective, and when the British were 50 yards away the Americans fired a volley which stopped the British infantry. The British returned fire, and musket and rifle fire ensued for 20 minutes, the British supported by cannon, at which point the lead American regiment fell back under cover of the next reserve regiment. The 3rd Continental Regiment was stationed behind the stone <b>wall</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opposite side of the road.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the building were revamped to accommodate an open layout suitable for a department store. Non-structural interior walls were torn down. A new atrium was created by constructing a <b>wall</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second storey, and {{could be used as}} an exhibition hall. A four-storey high waterfall was built {{at the back of the}} building, which has a new three-storey extension. A stained glass skylight was used as an interface to join the old and new parts of the building. New escalators and lifts were added to serve all six floors of the building. As a result, total floor space was increased from 3,700 to 4,600 square metres (39,800 to 49,500 square feet), with 4,650 square metres (50,000 square feet) of retail space created for use by the store.|$|E
