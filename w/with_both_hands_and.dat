500|$|The jumping prowess of the indriids {{have been}} well {{documented}} and are popular among ecotourists visiting Madagascar.

Indriids can leap up to 10m (33ft) rapidly from tree trunk to tree trunk, an ability referred to as [...] "ricochetal leaping". Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) manages to do this in the spiny forests of southern Madagascar. It is unknown how it avoids impaling its palms on the thorn-covered trunks of large plants such as Alluaudia. When distances between trees are too great, sifakas will descend to the ground and cross distances more than 100m (330ft) by standing upright and hopping sideways with the arms held to the side and waving up and down from chest to head height, presumably for balance. This is sometimes described as a [...] "dance-hop".|$|E
500|$|Robinson was {{the modern}} {{definition}} of a boxer puncher. He was able to fight almost any style: he could come out one round brawling, the next counterpunching, and the next fighting on the outside flicking his jab. Robinson would use his formless style to exploit his opponents weaknesses, he also possessed great speed and precision. He fought in a very conventional way with a firm jab, but threw hooks and uppercuts in flurries in an unconventional way. He possessed tremendous versatility—according to boxing analyst Bert Sugar, [...] "Robinson could deliver a knockout blow going backward." [...] Robinson was efficient <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> he displayed a variety of effective punches—according to a TIME magazine article in 1951, [...] "Robinson's repertoire, thrown with equal speed and power by either hand, includes every standard punch from a bolo to a hook—and a few he makes up {{on the spur of}} the moment." [...] Robinson commented that once a fighter has trained to a certain level, their techniques and responses become almost reflexive. [...] "You don't think. It's all instinct.

500|$|Breaking {{was created}} in the South Bronx, New York City during the early 1970s. It is the first hip-hop dance style. At the time of its creation, it was the only hip-hop dance style because Afrika Bambaataa {{classified}} it as one of the five pillars of hip-hop culture along with MCing (rapping), DJing (turntablism), graffiti writing (bombing), and knowledge. Though African Americans created breaking, Puerto Ricans maintained its growth and development when it was considered a fad in the late 1970s. In a 2001 interview Richard [...] "Crazy Legs" [...] Colón, the president of Rock Steady Crew, commented on how Puerto Ricans contributed to breaking: [...] "I think the difference is when the brothas first started doing [...] and it was at its infancy they weren't doing acrobatic moves. That didn't come into play until more Puerto Ricans got involved in the mid 70s. We then took the dance, evolved it and kept it alive. In '79 I was getting dissed. I would go into a dance and I would get dissed by a lot of brothas who would ask 'Why y'all still doing that dance? That's played out'. By 79, there were very few African American brothas that was doing this... We always maintained the flava. It was like a changing of the guard and all we did was add more flava to something that already existed." [...] Breaking includes four foundational dances: toprock, footwork-oriented steps performed while standing up; downrock, footwork performed <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet on the floor; freezes, stylish poses done on your hands; and power moves, complex and impressive acrobatic moves.

500|$|According to the Smithsonian, Roper's first {{velocipede}} of 1867–1869 used {{a purpose}} built frame rather than adapting an existing velocipede frame by retrofitting a steam engine, but one contemporary newspaper account does assert that Roper repurposed a velocipede frame, and Setright and motoring author Roland Brown say Roper used a hickory wood frame {{built by the}} Hanlon Brothers, who made and demonstrated boneshakers at fairs and circuses, although the Smithsonian's Roper has an iron frame. It had a wheelbase of [...] and two [...] diameter wheels made of iron bands on wooden s with wooden spokes. It had a rigid, forged iron fork, and a solid handlebar with wooden grips. Unlike the modern twistgrip, where the grip on only one side is a sleeve that rotates around the handlebar to open the throttle, the Roper velocipede's entire bar was rotated <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> it had a dual function. When turned forward, the throttle opened, and when turned backwards it applied the spoon brake on the front wheel. The seat doubled as the water reservoir; or the water tank {{can be described as}} saddle shaped. A hand pump transferred water from this tank to the boiler. The boiler was between the wheels with a [...] "nautical looking" [...] chimney from the boiler angling backwards behind the rider, with the firebox in the lower half of this housing, all of which hung from the frame with a spring to absorb shock, while two stay rods attached the bottom of the housing {{to the back of the}} frame. There were three water level cocks on the left side, near the water pump, and a drain valve on the bottom. The two cylinders, with bores of about [...] were located on either side of the frame, from the upper part of the boiler near the chimney, connecting to [...] cranks on the rear wheel.

Lauria {{opened the car door}} to leave and noticed a man quickly approaching the car. Startled and angered by the man's sudden appearance, she said, [...] "Now what is this..."

2500|$|The second {{category}} is the bocuses (sing. bocú alt. pl. bocúes), also called fondos ("bottoms").“The bokú is a single-headed drum, skin {{nailed to the}} shell, shell open at one end, long, shaped like a conic section and made of staves with iron hoops that circle them and hold them together.

2500|$|The name Christopher means [...] "Christ-bearer". [...] St Christopher {{was one of}} {{the most}} popular saints in the late medieval period and the cult based on him was derived from legends dating from the 5thcentury and later. [...] It is {{possible}} that there was a person called Christopher who was martyred between 249 and 251. [...] However, due to doubts about historical authenticity the cult came in for criticism during the Reformation. [...] The saint's late medieval popularity derived largely from a version of the story published in 1275 in the Golden Legend by Jacobus de Voragine, in which a giant named Christopher helped travellers across a dangerous river and, when he planted his staff in the riverbank, it burst into leaf. [...] In addition it was believed that seeing an image of the saint would protect from sudden death that day; this would have been particularly persuasive after the Black Death of 1348–49. [...] The statue at Norton Priory was [...] "created not as a work of art but as a practical working image with a religious purpose". [...] Images of StChristopher are found in three poses. [...] In the first pose the saint stands holding a staff in one hand and the Christ child in the other. [...] The second pose, that adopted by the Norton Priory statue, shows the saint with a staff in one hand; the other hand rests on his hip and the Christ child sits on his shoulder. [...] The third version shows the saint walking, holding the staff <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> the Christ child either kneels behind his neck or sits with one leg on each side of his neck.|$|E
2500|$|The Creatures' {{most famous}} and long-standing chant {{is known as the}} roll call. In the top of the first inning, when the Yankees are on the field and their {{starting}} pitcher is getting ready to throw the first pitch, everyone in the section stands and begins clapping. After the pitch is thrown, Creature [...] "Bald" [...] Vinny Milano gestures for the crowd to calm down, then cups his hands around his mouth and shouts out the name of the center fielder (e.g.: [...] "Yo, Aaron!", for Aaron Hicks). The whole group proceeds to chant the name until there is a response, usually {{in the form of a}} wave or a point; some Yankees respond with extra enthusiasm, such as Johnny Damon (who typically dropped to one knee and pointed at the Creatures <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands)</b> <b>and</b> Nick Swisher (who came to attention, faced the Creatures, and saluted). The Creatures move through the lineup, going from the center fielder to the left fielder, right fielder, first baseman, second baseman, shortstop and third baseman, in that order. (With the exception of a few rare instances, the pitcher and the catcher are not a part of the roll call.) Anti-obscenity laws were exercised in 2007, but are not always strictly enforced; if they are able, the Creatures will turn to the right field box seats at the completion of the Roll Call and chant [...] "Box seats suck!" [...] During the days of the bleachers' no-alcohol-sales policy, fans in the right-field box seats occasionally replied with a chant of [...] "We've got beer!" [...] If the Yankees are playing the Red Sox, the intensity of the Yankees – Red Sox rivalry takes hold; the Creatures then cut the 'box seats' chant short and instead chant [...] "Boston sucks!" [...] until that dissipates. If police cut this short, the Creatures resort to chanting [...] "No fun allowed!", or nothing at all. If a non-pitcher is replaced in a defensive position, the replacement is given the same chant. Sometimes, after a long rain delay, the Creatures will start another Roll Call just for fun. Also, until the Red Sox won the World Series in , the Creatures would chant [...] "1918!" [...] and hold up signs saying [...] "CURSE OF THE BAMBINO!" [...] and pictures of Babe Ruth to remind the Red Sox of the last time they won a championship.|$|E
2500|$|Martin took tenth {{place on}} the first stage, ending at the Mont des Alouettes, staying with the first large group on the road but unable to match the {{accelerations}} of the day's winner Philippe Gilbert. Coming off their win in the team time trial at the Giro d'Italia, and with several of the same riders plus very strong time trialist Martin present, the squad {{was considered one of}} the favorites for the Tour's team test. However, they were unable to duplicate their success from earlier in the season, finishing five seconds slower than their American rivals [...] for fifth {{place on the}} day. Stage 3 was also a day that [...] got the better of them. All appeared to be going well at first, as the team hit the front with strength and numbers once the morning's breakaway was caught. However, they made errors negotiating a sharp left-hand turn at [...] to go, and [...] was able to take first position again. Displaced by his leadout men's errors, Cavendish could only manage fifth in the sprint, behind 's Tyler Farrar. Cavendish rebounded in stage 5, another straightforward sprint stage. While late attacks from Edvald Boasson Hagen and Philippe Gilbert threatened to disrupt the sprint once again, the peloton chased them down, and Cavendish timed his sprint perfectly to take his first win of this Tour. Stage 6 had an undulating, hilly profile, such that the finish was unlikely to suit Cavendish. The team worked for Goss, and the Australian narrowly missed the day's honors, taking second in the final sprint behind Boasson Hagen. The flat seventh stage was perhaps the first of the Tour that went completely to popular expectations, as the HTC-Highroad team provided the strength necessary to bring back the morning breakaway and was ubiquitous in the final few kilometers, dominantly leading Cavendish out to his second win of this Tour. This stage ended at Châteauroux, site of Cavendish's first win in the 2008 Tour de France. The sprint ace was evidently quite aware of this, as he mimicked his victory reaction from three years prior, grabbing his helmt <b>with</b> <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> painting a shocked expression on his face.
