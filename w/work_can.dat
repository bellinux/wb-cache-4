5|$|Morris is {{recognised}} {{as one of}} {{the most}} significant cultural figures of Victorian Britain; though best known in his lifetime as a poet, he posthumously became better known for his designs. Founded in 1955, the William Morris Society is devoted to his legacy, while multiple biographies and studies of his work have seen publication. Many of the buildings associated with his life are open to visitors, much of his <b>work</b> <b>can</b> be found in art galleries and museums, and his designs are still in production.|$|E
5|$|Géricault {{painted with}} small brushes and viscous oils, which allowed {{little time for}} {{reworking}} and were dry by the next morning. He kept his colours apart from each other: his palette consisted of vermilion, white, naples yellow, two different yellow ochres, two red ochres, raw sienna, light red, burnt sienna, crimson lake, Prussian blue, peach black, ivory black, cassel earth and bitumen. Bitumen has a velvety, lustrous appearance when first painted, but {{over a period of}} time discolours to a black treacle, while contracting and thus creating a wrinkled surface, which cannot be renovated. As a result of this, details in large areas of the <b>work</b> <b>can</b> hardly be discerned today.|$|E

5|$|His {{building}} projects were concentrated in Edinburgh, where, from 1637, {{he served as}} principal master mason to the city. For ten years {{he was involved in}} the construction of the Tron Kirk on the High Street, which opened in 1647. The Tron was built to house the congregation of St Giles', which had been raised to cathedral status, and was laid out in the new T-plan form with the pulpit in the centre, to suit reformed worship. The design was informed by contemporary Dutch architecture and, in particular, by the work of Hendrick de Keyser whose Architectura Moderna showcased his church designs in the Netherlands. Mylne worked on the building with master wright John Scott who was responsible for the timber work. The building was executed in a Dutch influenced style with both gothic and classical details. The church was not fully complete before Mylne's death and was subsequently remodelled in the 18th century. A new spire was added in the 19th century following a fire, but Mylne's <b>work</b> <b>can</b> be seen in the body of the kirk. The carved tympanum was executed by Mylne's brother Alexander.|$|E
5|$|His poem Hugh Selwyn Mauberley {{consists}} of 18 short parts, and describes a poet whose life has become sterile and meaningless. Published in June 1920, it marked his farewell to London. He was disgusted by the massive {{loss of life}} {{during the war and}} was unable to reconcile himself with it. Stephen J. Adams writes that, just as Eliot denied he was Prufrock, so Pound denied he was Mauberley, but the <b>work</b> <b>can</b> nevertheless be read as autobiographical. It begins with a satirical analysis of the London literary scene, before turning to social criticism, economics, and an attack on the causes of the war; here the word usury appears in his work for the first time. The critic F. R. Leavis saw the poem as Pound's major achievement.|$|E
5|$|The seventh symphony, the Sinfonia antartica (1952), a {{by-product}} of the composer's score for Scott of the Antarctic, has consistently divided critical opinion on whether it can be properly classed as a symphony. Alain Frogley in Grove argues that though the <b>work</b> <b>can</b> make a deep impression on the listener, it is neither a true symphony in the understood {{sense of the term}} nor a tone poem and is consequently the least successful of the mature symphonies. The work is in five movements, with wordless vocal lines for female chorus and solo soprano in the first and last movements. In addition to large woodwind and percussion sections the score features a prominent part for wind machine.|$|E

5|$|Thomas was an {{accomplished}} writer of prose poetry, with collections such as Portrait of the Artist as a Young Dog (1940) and Quite Early One Morning (1954) showing {{he was capable}} of writing moving short stories. His first published prose work was After the Fair, printed in The New English Weekly on 15 March 1934. Jacob Korg believes that Thomas's fiction <b>work</b> <b>can</b> be classified into two main bodies, vigorous fantasies in a poetic style and, after 1939, more straightforward narratives. Korg surmises that Thomas approached his prose writing as an alternate poetic form, which allowed him to produce complex, involuted narratives that do not allow the reader to rest.|$|E
5|$|While Yeats's early poetry drew {{heavily on}} Irish myth and folklore, his later work was engaged with more {{contemporary}} issues, and his style underwent a dramatic transformation. His <b>work</b> <b>can</b> {{be divided into}} three general periods. The early poems are lushly pre-Raphaelite in tone, self-consciously ornate, and, at times, according to unsympathetic critics, stilted. Yeats began by writing epic poems such as The Isle of Statues and The Wanderings of Oisin. His other early poems are lyrics on the themes of love or mystical and esoteric subjects. Yeats's middle period saw him abandon the pre-Raphaelite character of his early work and attempt to turn himself into a Landor-style social ironist.|$|E
5|$|While some records such as Christophe Plantin's exist of what exact types {{were cut}} by Garamond himself, many {{details of his}} career remain uncertain: early {{estimates}} placed Garamond’s date of birth 1480, but modern opinion proposes much later estimates. A document called the Le Bé Memorandum (based on the memories of Guillaume Le Bé, but collated {{by one of his}} sons around 1643) suggests that Garamond finished his apprenticeship around 1510. This is considered unlikely by modern historians since his mother was still alive when he died in 1561 and little is known of him before around 1540. It has been suggested that the first Roman types designed by Claude Garamond were a set created for Robert Estienne and first used by him around 1530-3, that were the first typefaces used in Paris to copy the Manutius model. However, Vervliet suggests that these 'Estienne typefaces' were not designed by Garamond and that his career began somewhat later. Vervliet suggests that the creator of this set of typefaces to a unified design may have been a 'Master Constantin', recorded in the Le Bé Memorandum as a master type designer of the period before Garamond but about whom nothing is otherwise known and to whom no obvious other body of <b>work</b> <b>can</b> be ascribed. If so, his disappearance from history (perhaps due to an early death, since all his presumed work appeared in just three years from 1530 to 1533) and the execution of Augereau on a charge of heresy in 1534 may have allowed Garamond's reputation to develop in the following decade.|$|E
