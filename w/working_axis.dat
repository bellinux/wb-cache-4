40|$|DE 29905240 U UPAB: 20001023 NOVELTY - A tool {{guidance}} system has an arrangement {{made out of}} a translation axis (1), a rotation axis (2) and a parallel guidance gearbox (3) which form an open kinematic chain, plus one or more drives for the arrangement. The parallel guidance gearbox forms an end-member of the kinematic chain. The translation axis and the rotation axis essentially run parallel to one another. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The parallel guidance gearbox carries an end-effector (6) or a holder for an end-effector so that a <b>working</b> <b>axis</b> of the end-effector runs essentially parallel to the rotation axis. The gearbox is arranged and designed so that it makes possible {{the guidance of the}} <b>working</b> <b>axis</b> of the end-effector from a position where the <b>working</b> <b>axis</b> lies on the line arising through extension of the rotation axis onto a position where the <b>working</b> <b>axis</b> lies at a distance from this line. The gearbox has a first and a second member which form a scissors mechanism for parallel movement of the end-effector. USE - e. g. high pressure water jet cutting tools used in indusctry.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the sliding mode axis {{control of the}} electrohydraulic servo systems of a robotic excavator. The dynamic systems are described by a comprehensive model that accounts for nonlinearities and friction e#ects of asymmetric hydraulic cylinders. A sliding mode controller is developed for the electrohydraulic actuator of each <b>working</b> <b>axis</b> to provide stable force tracking. With a proper choice of the reference force, the control law can also allow tracking of a desired piston displacement trajectory.

40|$|Introduction: Since the da Vinci {{robotic system}} was introduced, {{it has been}} {{reported}} to have ergonomic advantages over conventional laparoscopy (COV). High investments associated with this system challenged us to design a more economical, mechanical alternative for improvement of laparoscopic ergonomics: the Minimally Invasive Manipulator (MIM). Material and methods: An earlier reported MIM prototype was investigated. Its shortcomings were input for the establishment of design criteria for a new prototype. Results: A new prototype was developed, aiming at improved intuitiveness and ergonomics. The handle and instrument tip were redesigned and the parallelogram mechanism was converted from linear moving parts to mainly rotating parts. Discussion: The new prototype was tested by a panel of experts and novices during an indicative ergonomic experiment. A major advantage of the MIM seems to be the possibility to perform laparoscopic surgery in a sitting position, in line with the <b>working</b> <b>axis,</b> instead of standing {{at the side of the}} patient. At an estimated cost level of 10 % of the da Vinci system, the MIM can be an economical alternative for the enhancement of laparoscopy ergonomics. However, further development for clinical feasibility is necessary...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Angular {{momentum}} {{pumps are}} very often applied in ships. Because the pumps are operating in hard conditions they are produced from cavitation wear-proof and electrochemical corrosion-resistant materials. The most common damage of pump shaft is neck wear in place where seals are mounted. Burnishing as modern finish plastic tooling method {{makes it possible}} to achieve high technological quality of elements. Due to many burnishing advantages, the method was proposed for treatment of angular momentum pumps shafts instead of finish machining (finish turning, grinding, lapping). The goal was to estimate optimal burnishing parameters that enable obtaining higher strength and the lowest roughness factor of angular momentum pumps shafts. Shaft necks were made of stainless steel type X 5 CrNi 1810. Roller burnishing tool SRMD type produced by Yamato was used in the research work. Its axis was parallel to <b>working</b> shaft <b>axis.</b> During <b>working,</b> technological parameters such as force, velocity and feed were changed...|$|R

40|$|The rule {{of thumb}} I learned in {{graduate}} school was that Axis I disorders such as anxiety and depression would bother the patients themselves but that Axis II disorders, the personality disorders, would mostly bother other people. The two categories were presented as discrete entities with a vague relationship that did not interact so much as coexist. Dealing with insurance companies that do not reimburse for <b>working</b> with <b>Axis</b> II disorders meant that I preferred to not diagnose personality disorders, nor to work with them, if I could avoid it. Of course, when working with individuals with depressive disorders, I find {{not all of them}} respond favorably to treatments, pharmacological or psychotherapeutic. Also, some people need repeated treatments even after a seemingly successful course. I have also observed that what makes people depressed varies as much as what assists them in recovery. Unfortunately, I have not had an overarching framework that could capture and explain the various forms of training and multitude of experiences I have had. These have remained as discrete as the Axis I and Axis II diagnoses of my graduate training. Bockian's book, Personality-Guided Therapy for Depression, provides a framework for integrating the treatment of depression with personality disorders. It is part of a series of books based in personality-guided psychology, as defined by Theodore Millon.

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} the performance of a concentrating collector in the heating system of a residential building. Air was used as the working fluid. The heating requirements of the building were determined for each day of the year.

It was assumed that the collector is equipped with a tracking system <b>working</b> in one <b>axis.</b> Calculations and comparisons were made for the amount of solar irradiation for three values of the receiverâ€™s inclination angle: Î² 1 = 60 Â°, Î² 2 = 90 Â° and Î² 3 = 30 Â°.
