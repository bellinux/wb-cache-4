5|$|Following this defeat, Buckner {{retired to}} Glen Lily but {{remained}} active in politics. Though he always claimed {{membership in the}} Democratic party, he opposed the machine politics of William Goebel, his party's gubernatorial nominee in 1899. In 1903, he supported his son-in-law, Morris Belknap, for governor against Goebel's lieutenant governor, J. C. W. Beckham. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> again nominated William Jennings Bryan in the 1908 presidential election, Buckner openly supported Bryan's opponent, Republican William Howard Taft.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Brooks ran for {{governor}} representing the Brindle Tails. Brooks was a very vocal supporter of civil rights for former slaves, but also a supporter of re-enfranchisement for ex-Confederates, which was the sentiment nationally of Liberal Republicans. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> met, they agreed not only to not run a candidate, but even to support Joseph Brooks, {{as long as the}} election was fair and legal, since elections in the state had been wrought with fraud for five years. The issue of re-enfranchisement of Confederates was central to the election.|$|E
25|$|Thompson became {{committee}} chairman in 1997, but {{was reduced to}} ranking minority member <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{took control of the}} Senate in 2001. Thompson served on the Finance Committee (dealing with health care, trade, Social Security, and taxation), the Intelligence Committee, and the National Security Working Group.|$|E
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Party {{gained control}} of the {{government}} in 2008, it appointed Chatumongkol as Chairman of the Board of the Bank of Thailand.|$|R
50|$|The Donrey era {{ended in}} Durant in 1998, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> became {{a unit of}} the far-flung Community Newspaper Holdings, Inc., {{headquartered}} in Birmingham, Alabama.|$|R
5000|$|Through {{much of its}} history, the Gazette was in {{competition}} with <b>the</b> Arkansas <b>Democrat.</b> Competition became more intense in 1979 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> changed from publishing in the evening to publishing in the morning.|$|R
25|$|Religious {{tensions}} {{were major}} {{issues in the}} presidential elections of 1928 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> nominated Al Smith, a Catholic who was defeated, and in 1960 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> nominated John F. Kennedy, a Catholic who was elected. For the next three elections, a Catholic would be nominated for the vice presidency {{by one of the}} two major parties (Bill Miller in 1964, Ed Muskie in 1968, Tom Eagleton and then Sarge Shriver in 1972), but the ticket would lose. Geraldine Ferraro would continue the tradition in 1984, until it was broken in 2008. A Catholic, John Kerry, lost the 2004 election to incumbent George W. Bush, a Methodist, who may have won the Catholic vote. 2012 was the first election where both major party vice presidential candidates were Catholic, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan.|$|E
25|$|Although studies {{indicate}} Democrats {{tend to be}} more supportive of a single-payer system than Republicans, none of the reform bills debated in the U.S. Congress <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> had a majority from 2007–2010, included proposals to implement a single payer health care system. Advocates argue that the largest obstacle to single-payer, universal system in the U.S. is a lack of political will.|$|E
25|$|A row {{immediately}} ensued <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{sought to}} attack Gregory So and other appointees over their foreign passports. The government maintained {{that this was}} not prohibited by the Basic Law. Donald Tsang said the Basic Law's right-of-abode requirements only applied to a small number of principal officials of the Government and the Judiciary. Tsang added that restricting the posts to those without overseas abode rights would be detrimental to the aim of absorbing and grooming more talented political hopefuls.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Democrat</b> was {{purchased}} in 1876 by General James Oliver Amos, {{and became the}} first newspaper published by Amos Publishing. The Amos family began the Daily News in 1891 and published both papers until June 28, 1940, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> folded. <b>The</b> family sold its interest in the Daily News in 1999.|$|R
50|$|In 1997 Gannett merged {{the evening}} sister paper the Rochester Times-Union into <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> and Chronicle, <b>the</b> two merged staffs in 1992 and had {{shared the same}} {{building}} since 1959 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> and Chronicle moved from a location at 59-61 East Main Street on the Main Street Bridge {{where they had been}} since 1923.|$|R
50|$|Dickey {{attributed}} {{his defeat}} as chairman to voters uninformed {{about the two}} candidates and their positions and prospects. A similar situation of concern developed <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg of Travis County did not resign in 2013 after her arrest for driving while intoxicated.|$|R
25|$|Glass {{served in}} the U.S. Senate for the {{remainder}} of his life, turning down the offer of a new appointment as Secretary of the Treasury from President Roosevelt in 1933. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> regained control of the Senate in 1933, Glass became Chairman of the Appropriations Committee. He was President pro tempore from 1941 to 1945. As a Senator, Glass's most notable achievement was passage of the Glass–Steagall Act, which separated the activities of banks and securities brokers and created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.|$|E
25|$|In November 1998, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle {{appointed}} Durbin as his Assistant Democratic Whip. Following the 2004 election, Durbin {{became the}} Democratic Whip in the 109th Congress.

Durbin served as Assistant Minority Leader from 2005 until 2007, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> became the Majority Party in the Senate. He then assumed the role of Assistant Majority Leader, or Majority Whip.|$|E
25|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> won the {{majority}} in 2008, they only held five seats upstate and two on Long Island.

Within the enrolled Democrats, six of the New York City-based Democrats are members of the Independent Democratic Conference and one caucuses with the Republicans. Two of the three Upstate Democrats are in the Democratic Conference while the remaining one caucuses with the Independent Democrats.|$|E
50|$|On January 14, 2014, Cooper won {{a special}} {{election}} for the District 21 seat for Craighead County in northeastern Arkansas.

25|$|Reconstruction in Alabama {{ended in}} 1874, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> regained {{control of the}} {{legislature}} and governor's office through an election dominated by fraud and violence. They wrote another constitution in 1875, and the legislature passed the Blaine Amendment, prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious-affiliated schools. The same year, legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools. Railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891. After disfranchising most African Americans and many poor whites in the 1901 constitution, the Alabama legislature passed more Jim Crow laws {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century to impose segregation in everyday life.|$|E
25|$|In 1911, the Democrats {{obtained}} {{a majority of}} seats in the State Assembly; and Smith became Majority Leader and Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means. In 1912, following {{the loss of the}} majority, he became the Minority Leader. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> reclaimed the majority after the next election, he was elected Speaker for the 1913 session. He became Minority Leader again in 1914 and 1915. In November 1915, he was elected Sheriff of New York County, New York. By now he was a leader of the Progressive movement in New York City and state. His campaign manager and top aide was Belle Moskowitz, a daughter of Jewish immigrants.|$|E
25|$|Feinstein was {{the author}} of the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban which expired in 2004. In 2013 she {{introduced}} a new assault weapons bill, which failed to pass. Feinstein is the first and only woman to have chaired the Senate Rules Committee (2007–09) and the Select Committee on Intelligence from 2009 to 2015, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> lost control of the Senate. She is the only woman to have presided over a U.S. presidential inauguration. At the age of , Feinstein is the oldest currently serving United States Senator. With the retirement of Barbara Mikulski, Feinstein is the longest current serving female senator. Feinstein officially declared her intention to run for reelection in the 2018 election cycle.|$|E
25|$|The GPA {{was first}} {{placed in the}} Office of Public Health. Foster {{transferred}} it to his office in July 1997, when he named Richey to head the operation.

50|$|In 1979, Suthep {{was elected}} Member of Parliament, {{representing}} Surat Thani province and <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Party. This constituency is a stronghold {{of the party}} and he was re-elected in all following elections. From 1986 to 1988, he was deputy minister of agriculture in Prem Tinsulanonda's cabinet, from 1992 to 1994 he held the same position in Chuan Leekpai's first cabinet. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Party returned to power in 1997, Suthep was appointed Minister of Transport and Communication, serving until 2001.|$|R
25|$|Brown was California's first African American Speaker of the Assembly, {{and served}} in the office from 1981 to 1995. In 1990, Brown helped {{negotiate}} an end to a 64-day budget standoff. In 1994, Brown gained the vote of a few Republicans to maintain the Speakership <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{lost control of the}} Assembly to the Republicans led by Jim Brulte. Brown regained control in 1995 by making a deal with Republican defectors Doris Allen and Brian Setencich, both of whom were elected Speaker by the Democratic minority. During their tenures, Brown was the de facto Speaker. During the 1990s, Brown dated Kamala Harris, then an Alameda County Deputy District Attorney. There was speculation the two would marry, but Brown broke up with her shortly after being elected Mayor of San Francisco.|$|E
25|$|As the longest-serving Democratic senator, Byrd {{served as}} President pro tempore four times when his party {{was in the}} majority: from 1989 until the Republicans won control of the Senate in 1995; for 17 days in early 2001, when the Senate was evenly split between parties and {{outgoing}} Vice President Al Gore broke the tie {{in favor of the}} Democrats; <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> regained the majority in June 2001 after Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont left the Republican Party to become an independent; and again from 2007 to his death in 2010, {{as a result of the}} 2006 Senate elections. In this capacity, Byrd was third in the line of presidential succession at the time of his death, behind Vice President Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.|$|E
25|$|Filibustering {{continued}} to be a major concern for presidents after Polk. Whigs presidents Zachary Taylor and Millard Fillmore tried to suppress the expeditions. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> recaptured the White House in 1852 with the election of Franklin Pierce, a filibustering effort by John A. Quitman to acquire Cuba received the tentative support of the president. Pierce backed off, however, and instead renewed the offer to buy the island, this time for $130million. When the public learned of the Ostend Manifesto in 1854, which argued that the United States could seize Cuba by force if Spain refused to sell, this effectively killed the effort to acquire the island. The public now linked expansion with slavery; if manifest destiny had once enjoyed widespread popular approval, this was no longer true.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, Charlton Lyons and the Baton Rouge {{businessman}} James H. Boyce, then {{a nominal}} Democrat, went {{with a group}} of mostly Republican conservatives to urge Goldwater to seek the presidency. Goldwater was at first reluctant to take on the challenge but nevertheless declared his candidacy early in 1964, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Lyndon Johnson had been president for less than two months and the heavy favorite for a full term of his own.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, Alexander {{was elected}} in state House District 88, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> {{incumbent}} <b>Democrat,</b> Uvalde Lindsey, was instead elected to the Arkansas State Senate.

50|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> Liberal <b>Democrat</b> Deputy Leader {{stepped down}} {{to take a}} ministerial post, Huppert was talked about as a {{possible}} contender for the post.|$|R
25|$|William Seward {{contemplated}} {{this potential}} in the 1840s, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> were the nation's majority party, usually controlling Congress, the presidency, and many state offices. The country's institutional structure and party system allowed slaveholders to prevail in more of the nation's territories and to garner {{a great deal of}} influence over national policy. With growing popular discontent with the unwillingness of many Democratic leaders to take a stand against slavery, and growing consciousness of the party's increasingly pro-Southern stance, Seward became convinced that the only way for the Whig Party to counteract the Democrats' strong monopoly of the rhetoric of democracy and equality was for the Whigs to embrace anti-slavery as a party platform. Once again, to increasing numbers of Northerners, the Southern labor system was increasingly seen as contrary to the ideals of American democracy.|$|E
25|$|President Harry S. Truman {{vetoed the}} Act, but enough Democrats {{joined with the}} Republicans to {{override}} the Presidential veto on June 23, 1947. It is in the platform of all major U.S. labor unions to call for {{the repeal of the}} Act, especially Section 14 (b), and at times this has been reflected in the platform of the Democratic Party. However, the only time this has ever seemed likely was <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> had a huge majority in both houses of Congress following the Republican electoral disaster of 1964. Even then, the repeal bill passed 221–203 in the House, but the two-thirds majority it needed in the Senate was never attained, partly because of long filibustering by Republicans such as Minority leader Everett Dirksen. Labor allies failed to break the filibuster, and the repeal bill was finally put to rest by the Montana Democrat Majority leader, Mike Mansfield, on February 10, 1966.|$|E
25|$|In South Australia, the Australian Democrats {{negotiated}} a crucial preference swap with Family First that prevented the Greens winning the final vacancy. If the Democrats had polled better, {{they would have}} collected Family First and Liberal preferences and won the final vacancy. Former Democrat Leader Meg Lees also contested the Senate in South Australia, but was eliminated late in the count. However, Lees did have some impact on the outcome, as there were large numbers of below the line preferences for both the Progressive Alliance (as well as One Nation) which were widely spread rather than flowing to the Democrats. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> were excluded, preferences flowed to Family First which prevented the Greens' Brian Noone passing the third Labor candidate. This resulted in a seat that could otherwise have been won by the Greens instead being won by Labor on Green preferences. The flow of One Nation preferences to Labor {{made it impossible for}} either Family First or the Liberal Party to win the final vacancy. Labor's Dana Wortley was elected to the final vacancy. The end result in South Australia was split 3 Liberal, 3 Labor.|$|E

50|$|In 2009, Dr. Larry Arnn, the {{president}} of the Claremont Institute while Cotton had been in the Publius Fellowship program, introduced Cotton to Chris Chocola, a former Congressman and {{the president}} of Club for Growth, an influential Republican PAC. The blog Power Line also continued to promote Cotton. An attempt was made to draft Cotton for Arkansas’ 2010 Senate race, to run against <b>the</b> incumbent <b>Democrat</b> U.S. Senator Blanche Lincoln. In 2011, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> Representative who had represented Cotton's home district retired after twelve years in office, Cotton ran for the seat.|$|R
5000|$|Publishing a {{newspaper}} {{on the frontier}} was challenging. In May 1835 Calhoun issued a second prospectus that apologized for the paper's virtual disappearance over the previous four months and promised a new editor would upgrade the quality of news <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Democrat</b> re-appeared. He cited a lack of available paper on which to print {{during the winter of}} 1834-1835. He did not cite, but presumably was responding to, the appearance of his first competition, the Chicago's American (sponsored by a rival political party, the Whigs).|$|R
