5|$|The allies had no 'standing army', nor {{was there}} any {{requirement}} to form one; since they <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> on home territory, they could muster armies as and when required. Different-sized allied forces thus appeared throughout the campaign. These numbers are discussed fully in the article for each battle.|$|E
5|$|After 5:00 pm, Custer's {{division}} (including Capehart's brigade) remounted, {{and attacked}} a Confederate battery. The battery {{was unable to}} shoot low enough to hit the charging cavalry, and was soon captured. The rebels responded with a Rebel yell, and soon the opposing forces <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> in close combat using sabers. Because of their position on the field, most of the Union casualties in this encounter belonged to the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry—but {{a large portion of}} the loss was from wounds that were not lethal.|$|E

5|$|After {{the passage}} of Typhoon Mamie, more than 800,000civilians and 9,000 {{soldiers}} were organized {{in order to protect}} reservoirs from flooding. By August28, 150,000civilians and 10,000soldiers <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> against flooding along the Liao River on a daily basis. Additionally, local military forces were called in to assist relief workers. The government organized buses and boats to carry flood victims. Some schools were used as shelter while restaurants and hospitals sent food and medicine.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1798 the Legions under Kniaziewicz <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> {{against the}} anti-French forces from the Kingdom of Naples, {{defeating}} them at the Battle of Civita Castellana on 4 December. Soon afterward, supplies from the captured Gaeta fortress allowed {{the creation of a}} Legion cavalry unit under Andrzej Karwowski. The Poles then fought at Magliano, Falari, Calvi and Capua before Naples capitulated on 23 January.|$|E
5|$|For the old Diefenbaker {{was in full}} cry. All {{the agony}} of the {{disintegration}} of his government was gone, {{and he seemed to}} be a giant revived by his contact with the people. This was Diefenbaker's finest election. He was virtually alone on the hustings. Even such loyalists as Gordon Churchill had to stick close to their own bailiwicks, where they <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> for their political lives.|$|E

5|$|Texas A {{graduates}} {{were called}} to use their military training during World War I, and by 1918, 49% of all graduates of the college were in military service, a larger percentage than any other college or university.

Many of the seniors <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> in France {{when the war ended}} two months later.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of parliamentary supremacy in the British Isles did not constitutionally affect the Thirteen Colonies, which retained an adherence to English common law, but it directly affected {{the relationship between}} Britain and the colonies.

60|$|We must pause {{here again}} {{for a moment to}} think where we are, and who is with us. The Teutsch Ritters have <b>been</b> <b>fighting,</b> {{independently}} of all states, for their own hand, or St. Adalbert's; partly for mere love of fight, partly for love of order, partly for love of God. Meantime, other Riders have <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> wholly for what they could get by it; and other persons, not Riders, have not <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> at all, but in their own towns peacefully manufacturing and selling.|$|R
5|$|After a quiet {{period in}} February 1945 {{absorbing}} replacements, the division was {{withdrawn from the}} defensive line and ordered to recapture Trier from the US Army. This attack started on 7 March in freezing conditions but after limited success a fresh US offensive struck the division and forced them back north of Mainz. By 19 March, Raithel's regiment had {{been converted into a}} kampfgruppe (battlegroup) consisting of two gebirgsjäger battalions, a mountain artillery battalion, a pioneer company and eight anti-tank guns. Two weeks later they <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> their way out of encirclement near Limburg. On 1 April 1945, Kampfgruppe Raithel and the rest of what remained of the division drove east. Shortly afterwards, Raithel received a serious head wound and was captured. The remnants of the division disintegrated {{over the next few days}} and weeks and were captured by the Americans.|$|E
5|$|Apparently formidable, the Libyan {{military}} disposition in Chad was {{marred by}} serious flaws. The Libyans were prepared for a war {{in which they would}} provide ground and air support to their Chadian allies, act as assault infantry, and provide reconnaissance. By 1987, however, Muammar Gaddafi had lost his allies, exposing Libya's inadequate knowledge of the area. Libyan garrisons came to resemble isolated and vulnerable islands in the Chadian Sahara. Also important was the low morale among the troops, who <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> in a foreign country, and the structural disorganization of the Libyan army, which was in part induced by Gaddafi's fear of a military coup against him. This fear led him to avoid the professionalization of the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|At 0730 the 44th (Lowland) Infantry Brigade and the 46th (Highland) Infantry Brigade of the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division, {{supported}} by the 31st Tank Brigade moved off their start lines behind a rolling barrage fired from 344 guns. The 46th Brigade initially advanced without armoured support, because in bypassing the mine and booby trap-ridden village of Le Mesnil-Patry, its tanks were forced to negotiate minefields flanking the village. The 2nd Battalion, Glasgow Highlanders faced only light resistance, while the 9th Battalion The Cameronians, ran into the grenadiers of the 12th SS Panzer Division, who had allowed the barrage to pass over their positions before opening fire. Reuniting with their tanks at around 1000, by midday the two battalions <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> for control of their initial objectives; Cheux and Le Haut du Bosq.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} Britain was still Australia's major trading partner, {{although}} it would be overtaken by Japan and the United States by the 1960s. The two countries still had strong cultural ties, and Menzies was strongly pro-British. Most Australians were of British descent, and Britain was still the largest source of immigrants to Australia, largely because British ex-servicemen and their families qualified for free passage, and other British migrants received subsidised passage. Australian and British troops <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> the communists together in the Korean War and the Malayan Emergency. Australia still maintained close defence ties with Britain through the Australia New Zealand and Malaya (ANZAM) area, which was created in 1948. Australian war plans of this era continued to be closely integrated with those of Britain, and involved reinforcing the British forces in the Middle East and Far East.|$|E

The Chili Peppers <b>were</b> <b>fighting,</b> and on the verge of breaking up. Flea was beginning to question the band's future and thought it may be necessary to break the band up. He made one last attempt to keep the band together, asking Frusciante to rejoin. Frusciante had recently completed a drug rehabilitation program after more than five years of heroin addiction, and gladly accepted the invitation.|$|E

Then the sailors fastened down the hatchways leading to the third-class section. They said they wanted to keep the air down there so the vessel could stay up longer.

5|$|Even as Texian {{governmental}} authority declined, rumors flew that Santa Anna would personally lead {{an invasion}} of Texas to quell the rebellion. Despite this news, Texian army strength continued to dwindle. Texas settlers were divided on whether they <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> for independence or {{a return to a}} federalist government in Mexico. The confusion caused many settlers to remain at home or to return home. Fewer than 100Texian soldiers remained garrisoned at the Alamo Mission in San Antonio de Béxar (now San Antonio, Texas). Their commander, James C. Neill, feared that his small force would be unable to withstand an assault by the Mexican troops. In response to Neill's repeated requests for reinforcements, Governor Smith assigned Travis and 30 men to the Alamo; they arrived on February 3. Most of the Texians, including Travis, believed that any Mexican invasion was months away.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of war between North Korea and South Korea on June 25, 1950, the United States mobilized a large contingent of troops to send into the beleaguered country. Initially, units occupying Japan were called into the country, but forces were eventually dispatched from the United States. In August 1950, Kouma, who was then a Sergeant First Class, sailed for Korea along {{with much of the}} 2nd Infantry Division. It arrived there in late August and was moved into line at the Pusan Perimeter, where US troops <b>were</b> <b>fighting</b> a tight defensive line around the port city of Pusan.|$|E
