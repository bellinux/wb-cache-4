40|$|Coexistence of {{wind sea}} and swell {{often results in}} {{double-peaked}} spectra. Separation and identification of the <b>wave</b> <b>energies</b> of wind sea and swell from the measured spectra allow {{us to have a}} more realistic description of the sea state, which is of great importance to offshore structure design, safety of marine operation, and the study of wind wave dynamics. This paper describes a method based on the peak frequency of a steepness function to separate the <b>wave</b> <b>energies</b> of wind sea and swell from the omnidirectional wave spectra. Using the PM spectral model for the wind sea spectrum, the separation frequency is derived from the peak frequency of the steepness function. This steepness method does not rely on the availability of the information of wind velocities and wave directions and can be easily implemented for operational uses. Verification results using wave data collected of Seoguipo in Korea are presented...|$|R

25|$|Bloch {{waves are}} {{important}} because of Bloch's theorem, which states that the energy eigenstates for an electron in a crystal can be written as Bloch waves.

25|$|When a {{radio wave}} reaches the ionosphere, the {{electric}} {{field in the}} wave forces the electrons in the ionosphere into oscillation at the same frequency as the radio wave. Some of the radio-frequency energy is given up to this resonant oscillation. The oscillating electrons will then either be lost to recombination or will re-radiate the original <b>wave</b> <b>energy.</b> Total refraction can occur when the collision frequency of the ionosphere {{is less than the}} radio frequency, and if the electron density in the ionosphere is great enough.|$|E

50|$|When {{the ocean}} floor has a gradual slope, the wave will steepen until the crest becomes unstable, {{resulting}} in turbulent whitewater spilling down {{the face of the}} wave. This continues as the wave approaches the shore, and the <b>wave's</b> <b>energy</b> is slowly dissipated in the whitewater. Because of this, spilling waves break for a longer time than other waves, and create a relatively gentle wave. Onshore wind conditions make spillers more likely.|$|R
25|$|These Bloch <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> eigenstates {{are written}} with {{subscripts}} as ψn k, where n is a discrete index, called the band index, which is present {{because there are}} many different Bloch waves with the same k (each has a different periodic component u). Within a band (i.e., for fixed n), ψn k varies continuously with k, as does its energy. Also, for any reciprocal lattice vector K, ψn k = ψn,(k+K). Therefore, all distinct Bloch waves occur for k-values within the first Brillouin zone of the reciprocal lattice.|$|E

MHK development in U.S. and international waters includes projects using devices such as, <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> converters in open coastal areas with significant waves, tidal turbines placed in coastal and estuarine areas, in-stream turbines in fast-moving rivers, ocean current turbines in areas of strong marine currents, and ocean thermal energy converters in deep tropical waters.|$|E

50|$|Classical <b>waves</b> {{transfer}} <b>energy</b> without transporting matter {{through the}} medium (material). For example, waves in a pond do not carry the water molecules from place to place; rather the <b>wave's</b> <b>energy</b> travels through the water, leaving the water molecules in place. Additionally, charged particles, such as electrons and protons create electromagnetic fields when they move, and these fields transport the type of energy known as electromagnetic radiation, or light. A changing magnetic field will induce a changing electric field and vice versa—the two are linked. These changing fields form electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves differ from mechanical waves in {{that they do not}} require a medium to propagate. This means that electromagnetic waves can travel not only through air and solid materials, but also through the vacuum of space.|$|R
40|$|This paper reports {{some recent}} {{progress}} {{in analyzing the}} effects of an energy-deposition or extraction layer on supersonic flows over a wedge. Several algebraic relations across an energy-deposition/extraction layer are obtained, based on a quite simple model for the deposition/extraction layer. With the aid of these simple relations, we find analytical relations between the deposition/extraction and {{the pressure on the}} wedge apex point for two situations in which an oblique shock originally detaches from or attaches to the wedge apex point. This study obtains two important conclusions: For originally detached oblique shock <b>waves,</b> <b>energy</b> deposition results in a decrease in the pressure behind the shock and that on the apex point; energy extraction has the opposite effects [...] For originally attached oblique shock <b>waves,</b> <b>energy</b> deposition results in an increase in the pressure behind the shock and that on the apex point; with stronger energy deposition, the shock then detaches from the wedge and the pressure on the apex point begins to decrease. Two series of numerical simulations with Euler equations for flows over two 15 - and 60 -deg wedges with different energy-deposition/extraction strengths confirm the preceding conclusions...|$|R
