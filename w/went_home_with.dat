25|$|Toronto {{returned}} to prominence in 2011 as veteran head coach Crljen {{was hired to}} lead the team for the 2011 season. During the regular season Croatia {{finished second in the}} standings with the best defensive record followed by with the second best offensive record. They also witnessed success at the international level with their second Croatian World Club Championship. In the preliminary round of the playoffs they faced Mississauga Eagles FC, where they easily defeated them 8-1 on goals on aggregate in a series. The following round Croatia advanced to the CSL Championship final after defeating the York Region Shooters 2-0 with Josip Keran, and Fitzwilliams providing the goals. The championship match saw Croatia return to glory as Fitzwilliams secured the title for them after a 1-0 victory over Capital City F.C.. At the conclusion of the season Croatia <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> the majority of the CSL team awards with the league recognizing Crljen as the Coach of the Year. While players Maletic received his second consecutive MVP award, and Sven Arapovic was given the Defender of the Year. The final award went to club president Joe Pavicic with the Harry Paul Gauss award for his allegiance, commitment and support to the league and its member clubs.|$|E
25|$|In 2002 as {{a result}} of an {{increase}} in teams the CPSL split the league into two Conferences the Eastern and Western with Croatia being placed in the Western Conference. The organization brought in Zarko Brala to manage the squad for the 2002 season. Throughout the majority of the season Brala managed to compete with the Mississauga Olympians for the Conference title, but was discharged from his post on September 9, 2002. The reasoning for his dismissal was regarding his coaching decisions during the teams defeat in the annual Croatian-North American Soccer Tournament, where he inserted his son back-up goalkeeper Anthony Brala into the starting line-up instead of George Azcurra. His decision caused a negative reaction from the Croatian community, which prompted team president Mario Skara to relive him of his duties. His immediate replacement was former head coach Drago Santic, who captured the Puma League title in 1996 for Croatia. Under the guidance of Santic the team managed to clinch the Western Conference title, and achieved a six game undefeated streak. He also managed to lead Croatia to the finals of the Canada Cup tournament, where they were defeated 1-0 by the Ottawa Wizards. Nevertheless their playoff run came to a quick conclusion after being defeated by the North York Astros in the preliminary round. After producing the second best defensive record in the league Croatia <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> the Goalkeeper of the Year to Azcurra, and with the Defender of the Year to Domagoj Sain.|$|E

[...] With most of the security personnel still watching the gates per Mike Veeck's orders, {{there was almost no}} one guarding the playing surface. Soon, the first of what would be thousands of attendees rushed onto the field, causing Kravec to flee the mound and join his teammates in a barricaded clubhouse. [...] Between 5,000and 7,000people are estimated to have taken the field. Some climbed the foul poles, others set records on fire, or ripped up the grass. [...] The batting cage was destroyed; the bases were pulled up and stolen. Among those taking the field was 21-year-old aspiring actor Michael Clarke Duncan; during the melee, Duncan slid into third base, had a silver belt buckle stolen, and <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> a bat from the dugout. As Bill Veeck stood with a microphone near where home plate had been, begging people to return to the stands, a bonfire raged in center field.|$|E
500|$|Both {{sides were}} willing. Catmull and fellow Pixar co-founder Alvy Ray Smith had long wanted {{to produce a}} computer-animated feature. In addition, Disney had {{licensed}} Pixar's Computer Animation Production System (CAPS), and that made it the largest customer for Pixar's computers. Jobs made it apparent to Katzenberg that although Disney was happy with Pixar, {{it was not the}} other way around: [...] "We want to do a film with you," [...] said Jobs. [...] "That would make us happy." [...] At this same time, Peter Schneider, president of Walt Disney Feature Animation, was potentially interested in making a feature film with Pixar. When Catmull, Smith and head of animation Ralph Guggenheim met with Schneider in the summer of 1990, they found the atmosphere to be puzzling and contentious. They later learned that Katzenberg intended that if Disney were to make a film with Pixar, it would be outside Schneider's purview, which aggravated Schneider. After that first meeting, the Pixar contingent <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>with</b> low expectations and was surprised when Katzenberg called for another conference. Catmull, Smith, and Guggenheim were joined by Bill Reeves (head of animation research and development), Jobs, and Lasseter. They brought with them an idea for a half-hour television special called A Tin Toy Christmas. They reasoned that a television program would be a sensible way to gain experience before tackling a feature film.|$|E
