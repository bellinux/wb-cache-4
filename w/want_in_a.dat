Staples Center was a state-of-the-art arena, complete with luxury suites and all the modern amenities that fans and athletes would <b>want</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> brand-new facility. With a new home, a new coach, a potential 50-goal scorer in the fold and players such as Rob Blake, Luc Robitaille, Glen Murray, Jozef Stumpel, Donald Audette, Ian Laperriere and Mattias Norstrom, the Kings improved dramatically, finishing the season the 1999–2000 season with a 39–31–12–4 record (94 points), good for second place in the Pacific Division. But in the 2000 playoffs, the Kings were once again eliminated in the first round, this time by the Detroit Red Wings in a four-game sweep.|$|E

In 1990, dozens of women in Riyadh drove their cars in protest, were imprisoned for one day, had their passports confiscated, and some of them lost their jobs. In September 2007, the Association for the Protection and Defense of Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia, co-founded by Wajeha al-Huwaider and Fawzia al-Uyyouni, gave a 1,100 signature petition to King Abdullah asking for women to be allowed to drive. On International Women's Day 2008, Huwaider filmed herself driving and received international media attention after the video was posted on YouTube.

500|$|O'Hara next {{played an}} {{unconventional}} {{role as a}} timid socialite who joins the army as a cook in Henry Hathaway's Ten Gentlemen from West Point (1942), which tells the fictional story of the first class of the United States Military Academy in the early 19th century. The film was disagreeable to O'Hara because Payne dropped out {{and was replaced by}} George Montgomery, whom she found [...] "positively loathsome". Montgomery attempted to make a pass at her during the production, prolonging his kiss with her after the director had yelled [...] "cut". Later that year, O'Hara starred opposite Tyrone Power, Laird Cregar and Anthony Quinn in Henry King's swashbuckler The Black Swan. O'Hara recalled that it was [...] "everything you could <b>want</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lavish pirate picture: a magnificent ship with thundering cannons; a dashing hero battling menacing villains... sword fights; fabulous costumes...". She found it exhilarating working with Power, who was renowned for his [...] "wicked sense of humor". O'Hara grew very concerned about one scene in the picture in which she is thrown overboard in her underwear by Power, and sent a warning letter home to Ireland in advance. She refused to take her wedding ring off in one scene which resulted in screen adjustments {{to make it look like}} a dinner ring. Though the film was praised by critics and is seen as one of the period's most enjoyable adventure films, the critic from The New York Times thought O'Hara's character lacked depth, commenting that [...] "Maureen O'Hara is brunette and beautiful—which is all the part requires".|$|E

[...] Jon Dolan of Entertainment Weekly explained the record is [...] "more personal and, by accessing a deeper emotional palette, maybe even more universal". Blender gave a positive review, confessing, [...] "Denser and more scuzzed-up than Fallen, the album amps everything up to gloriously epic, over-the-top proportions". Billboard said, [...] "Those who embraced Fallen will doubtlessly fall even harder into The Open Door." [...] Spins Mellisa Maerz rated the album with four stars out of five and commented, [...] "A post-dysfunctional kiss-off that builds from ethereal Sunday-mass uplift into full-eff-you guitar dirges, revealing an angrier, more self-assured Lee who waxes sardonic [...] but still misses the comfort in being sad".|$|E
500|$|The Legendary Axe {{received}} positive coverage {{upon its}} release. It was previewed by various video gaming magazines before its release. A preview from Electronic Gaming Monthly called the game [...] "a definite 10" [...] and [...] "one {{of the best}} video games we've ever played". In {{an overview of the}} PC Engine, VideoGames & Computer Entertainment referred to the game as [...] "characteristic of the PC Engine's advanced sound, graphics and game play". A later preview from the same magazine said {{that it was one of}} the console's better games, and they applauded the arcade-like graphics and gameplay. They said that everyone who owned the console should own the game and that it was an [...] "excellent showcase of the game system's capabilities". It was reviewed in Electronic Gaming Monthly in September1989. In the review, Steve Harris said it was one of his favorite games, praising its theme, graphics, sound, and execution; he added that its features were unsurpassed by any video game at the time. Ed Semrad used this game to criticize Rastan, saying The Legendary Axe [...] "is how [...] should have been done". He added that it should be the first game TurboGrafx-16 owners should buy. Donn Nauert called the game one of the best adventure games seen at the time and echoed Harris' praises. Jim Allee repeated Semrad's observation that the game is Rastan but with better graphics; he praised its detailed sprites, the diverse music and gameplay, and difficulty level and concluded that it [...] "is everything you could <b>want</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> game". Later in that issue Nauert presented a partial walkthrough of the game, where he further praised the game for breathing new life into the platformer genre. An abridged walkthough was published in VideoGames & Computer Entertainment in November1989.|$|E
500|$|Silent Hill 2 {{received}} {{praise from}} video game journalists {{at the time}} of its release and in retrospect. Andy Greenwald of Spin magazine praised it as a frightening but [...] "restrained" [...] game. Jon Thompson of AllGame stated: [...] "Silent Hill 2 feels a bit rushed, and although it might not live up to the dizzying horror of the first game, it packs enough of its own punch to make it a worthy sequel." [...] IGN's Doug Perry wrote: [...] "It's frightening, deep, clever, and tries to improve the genre, if just a little, and in the end, that's all I really <b>want</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> survival horror game." [...] Joe Fielder of GameSpot concluded, [...] "Silent Hill 2 is a much prettier, somewhat smarter but less a compelling game than the original." [...] In [...] (2010), Tristian Donovan described Silent Hill 2 as the [...] "high point" [...] of the series. In a retrospective article on the survival horror genre, IGN writer Jim Sterling praised the game's plot as [...] "one of the finest examples of narrative construction in gaming to this day". In another retrospective article on survival horror, fellow IGN writer Travis Fahs credited the game as a factor in the [...] "short-lived period of renewed interest in horror games". Online game critic for [...] The Escapist Magazine Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw lists this game as among his top five favourite games of all time, praising it for its thick and unsettling atmosphere creating tension and fear for players. In his review of the game he commented, [...] "Silent Hill 2 is the game I replay every now and again to remind myself that for all the shiny brown, quick-time event, RPG element space marines, gaming is still worth defending," [...] and that [...] "It's a fascinating voyage of pain and despair that leaves you emotionally drained and satisfied." ...|$|E

[...] Scott Herhold, Webb’s first editor at the Mercury-News, wrote in a 2013 column that [...] "Gary Webb was a journalist of outsized talent. Few reporters I've known could match his nose for an investigative story. When he was engaged, he worked hard. He wrote well. But Webb had one huge blind side: He was fundamentally a man of passion, not of fairness. When facts didn't fit his theory, he tended to shove them to the sidelines." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{a number}} of {{commentators}} have expressed enthusiasm over the increasing [...] "propertization" [...] of intellectual property (that is to say, the increased application of real property doctrines to intangible property) and {{the extension of the}} trespass to chattels doctrine to computer networks, {{a number of}} detractors have expressed concern over the ramifications of extending the theory to protect electronic communications that do not actually damage the computer systems in question but only cause nominal damage due to their content. [...] Primarily, these critics worry that extending trespass to chattels in this fashion would stifle free speech on the internet because any unwelcome email might constitute a trespass and may subject the sender not only to civil liability under the trespass theory but to criminal liability as well. [...] This would presumably reduce people's willingness to communicate freely on the Internet and curtail the Internet's ability to function as an open, democratic forum. Particularly in situations where the electronic communication is an email that contains speech that is of importance to the public and the communications do not hamper the functionality of the recipient's computer system, First Amendment free speech protections ought to outweigh the property right in the unharmed computer system. Similarly, critics have also expressed concerns that plaintiffs have employed the doctrine to stifle legitimate competition. For example, the screen-scraping cases indicate that courts might interpret trespass to chattels {{in such a way that}} allows major corporations to prevent price comparison sites from employing harmless bots to aggregate information that users <b>want</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> readily accessible format since it might encourage consumers to look elsewhere.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{halves of}} the fifth season {{received}} overwhelming critical acclaim.

Critics will spend the next decade dissecting and arguing about what made it great, but the reasons are endless and already well documented." [...] During the final season, the show also received praise from George R. R. Martin, author of the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, particularly the episode [...] "Ozymandias"; Martin commented that [...] "Walter White is a bigger monster than anyone in Westeros." [...] In his review of the second half of season 5, Seth Amitin of IGN stated, [...] "This final batch of Breaking Bad {{is one of the best}} run of episodes TV has ever offered," [...] and praised [...] "Ozymandias" [...] in particular, referring to it as [...] "maybe the best episode of TV [...] ever seen." [...] Jonah Goldberg of National Review called it [...] "the best show currently on television, and perhaps even the best ever." [...] The veteran actor Sir Anthony Hopkins wrote a letter of praise to Bryan Cranston, telling him that his [...] "performance as Walter White was the best acting I have seen– ever." [...] He lauded the rest of the cast and crew as well. The letter first appeared on Steven Michael Quezada's (who portrayed DEA Agent Steven Gomez) Facebook page, and in spite of it being taken down, the letter soon went viral.
