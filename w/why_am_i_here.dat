5|$|You are right. I did {{not think}} anything. I wasn’t thinking. I was feeling and I was dying. And then I was just like, You can’t go down like this! You have to turn this into music. You have to try, at least. I was so embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after all of that. A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write. They were giving me tracks and doing it all. I was like, <b>Why</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here?</b> Then I got the perfect {{combination}} of people to really support me and make me feel confident. It was an amazing awakening. I walked into the session and I was like, You gotta know, I don’t care about anything except the truth right here.|$|E
6000|$|So {{she left}} me again, whilst I sat in the utter {{isolation}} and stillness, eating bread and drinking the wine, which was good. And I listened for any sound: only the faint noise of the stream. And I wondered, <b>Why</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here,</b> on this ridge of the Alps, in the lamp-lit, wooden, close-shut room, alone? <b>Why</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|THE OLD WOMAN. Oh, what do I care {{why you are}} here? <b>Why</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here?</b> I, who sacrificed all my inclinations to womanly {{virtue and}} propriety! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} what to think," [...] Charlie said feebly. [...] "I {{do not know}} where <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> or <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here.</b> <b>I</b> {{remember}} that there was a fray in the street, and <b>I</b> suppose <b>I</b> <b>was</b> hurt. But <b>why</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> brought <b>here,</b> instead of being taken to my lodgings?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The answer comforted me not. It {{remained}} {{clear that}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not wanted either in Heaven nor upon the earth. God {{did not want}} me. He was glad {{to get rid of}} me. My mother did not want me. She could have done without me. Nobody wanted me. <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> <b>here?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{love him}} myself," [...] replied Mrs. Grouse. [...] "I {{suspected}} {{that he was}} somewhere about, and that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here.</b> Did you see him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|DON JUAN. [Springing to his feet] No; {{and that}} is the enigma on which I ponder in darkness. <b>Why</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here?</b> I, who repudiated all duty, trampled honor underfoot, and laughed at justice! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have I not tried?" [...] he {{answered}} bitterly. [...] "Tell me, do I so easily relinquish my great desire? <b>Why</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here?</b> Because I {{have said to}} myself that I will not be denied. Adrienne shall be mine!" ...|$|E
6000|$|V:2:49 [...] ALAR. [...] 'Tis the burthen [...] Of this {{unfilled}} doom weighs on my spirit.

6000|$|... "He will do so," [...] she {{declared}} confidently, [...] "and before long. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here.</b> You {{must come to}} me the moment--the very moment you know! You understand that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{in hopes}} of getting it. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here.</b> The more <b>I</b> think of the matter the more {{convinced}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> that the letter has never left this house." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not. I know, to my joy, {{that you}} are {{different}} from other girls; that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> and asking you to be my wife. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> loved you that day on the mountain-side, because you were different." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Does it, does it indeed?" [...] {{she exclaimed}} eagerly; [...] "then <b>why</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here</b> a moment longer? Oh, {{if you knew}} by what fears I was urged to quit Cumnor Place!

6000|$|... "It's a chance, I tell you," [...] he interrupted, [...] "as {{everything}} is in a man's life. Only the asses won't see it! <b>Why</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here</b> now, an outcast from civilisation, {{instead of being a}} happy man enjoying all the pleasures of London?

6000|$|... 'Or me, my children,' said Bishop Nicodemus. 'This is a {{great day}} for Syria! to find the chiefs of both nations {{assembled}} at the castle of a Shehaab. <b>Why</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here</b> but to preach peace and love? And Butros Keramy, my friend, my dearly beloved brother Butros, if you wish to please the patriarch, your uncle, who loves you so well, you will no longer call Druses sons of Eblis.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is {{certainly}} alive," [...] Anna declared. [...] "More than that, he arrived to-day at the boarding-house where <b>I</b> <b>am</b> staying, greeted {{me with a}} theatrical start, and claimed me--as his wife.

6000|$|... "But there is. That is {{the very}} point. The facts always smash youth's logic, and they usually smash youth's heart, too. It's like platonic friendships and [...] . and all such things; they are all right in theory, but they won't work in practice. I used to believe in such things once.

6000|$|... "That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here,</b> your Grace," [...] I replied; [...] "only {{you have}} twisted the words. There has been foul play enough.

6000|$|... "Then <b>why</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here?</b> Why am I, and {{six hundred}} {{thousand}} {{subjects of the}} Queen, honest, loyal, and industrious, why are we, after manfully struggling for years, and each year sinking lower in the scale, why are we driven from our innocent and happy homes, our country cottages that we loved, first to bide in close towns without comforts, and gradually to crouch into cellars, or find a squalid lair like this, without even the common necessaries of existence; first the ordinary conveniences of life, then raiment, and, at length, food, vanishing from us.|$|E
6000|$|And <b>why</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here?</b> Why am I {{far from}} landscape, music, conversation? Why, merely because I will follow neither Fame nor Fortune nor Faith. They call {{to us in}} the market-place, but I will not dance. Fame blows her trumpet, and offers her {{shilling}} (the Queen's). Faith peals her bells, and asks for MY shilling. Fortune rattles her banking-scales. They call, and the world joins the waltz; but I will not march with them. [...] "Go after glory, commerce, creeds," [...] I cry; [...] "only let Harold Skimpole live!"

6000|$|Solivet had accosted him. I saw his eye glance anxiously round, then {{he seemed}} reassured, and came towards me with some eagerness, {{greeting}} me with some compliment, I know not what, on my appearance; but I cut this {{as short as}} <b>I</b> could <b>be</b> saying: 'Know you, Monsieur, <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here?</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> come {{to ask you to}} bestow a little half-hour on one who is longing to see you.' ...|$|R
60|$|MENDOZA. Myself! I {{have thrown}} myself away for her sake: that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here.</b> No matter: <b>I</b> count the world well lost for her.

She had humor; she had intellect; she could cook to perfection; and her highly strung temperament made her uncertain, incalculable, variable, capricious, cruel, in a word, enchanting.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{know some}} people get disheartened, and I {{know some people}} want to throw in the sponge and give up, but I can't do that.

6000|$|It was noon. Sir Edward {{had stepped}} from his brougham and was {{proceeding}} on foot down the Strand. He was dressed {{with his usual}} faultless taste, but in alighting from his vehicle his foot had slipped, and a small round disk of conglomerated soil, which instantly appeared on his high arched instep, marred the harmonious glitter of his boots. Sir Edward was fastidious. Casting his eyes around, at a little distance he perceived the stand of a youthful bootblack. Thither he sauntered, and carelessly placing {{his foot on the}} low stool, he waited the application of the polisher's art. [...] "'Tis true," [...] said Sir Edward to himself, yet half aloud, [...] "the contact of the Foul and the Disgusting mars the general effect of the Shiny and the Beautiful--and, yet, <b>why</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here?</b> I repeat it, calmly and deliberately--why am I here? Ha! Boy!" ...|$|E
60|$|She left me, and I {{continued}} {{some time}} {{walking up and}} down the passages of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to my adversary. But I discovered no trace of him and was beginning to conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his menaces when suddenly I heard a shrill and dreadful scream. It came from the room into which Elizabeth had retired. As I heard it, the whole truth rushed into my mind, my arms dropped, the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended; I could feel the blood trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs. This state lasted but for an instant; the scream was repeated, and I rushed into the room. Great God! Why did I not then expire! <b>Why</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here</b> to relate the destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth? She was there, lifeless and inanimate, thrown across the bed, her head hanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair. Everywhere I turn I see the same figure--her bloodless arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal bier. Could I behold this and live? Alas! Life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated. For a moment only did I lose recollection; I fell senseless on the ground.|$|E

5000|$|Though {{the series}} {{features}} a paranormal lead, Cynthia Hand {{has stated that}} Unearthly is primarily [...] "a human story" [...] centered on personal matters. [...] "My story is about a girl who wants to understand her purpose on this earth. Her situation is a metaphor, I think, for a basic question all human beings ask themselves at some point: <b>Why</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here?</b> Clara isn’t trying to find her place in some epic struggle between good and evil. She {{is trying to find}} herself," [...] Hand said. Hand was partly inspired by events in her own life prior to writing the tale: [...] "I’d just had a baby, my husband had a new job, and we’d moved to a town where I didn’t know anybody, and I really had to stop and ask myself, Who am I? What am I doing here?" [...] These experiences gradually lent themselves to the development of Clara's character.|$|E
5000|$|This Is What the Truth Feels Like {{focuses on}} several themes, {{including}} [...] "moving on {{from a broken}} relationship" [...] to [...] "falling in love again". Her divorce from Gavin Rossdale served as {{the main source of}} inspiration for the former, while her subsequent romance with Blake Shelton served as an inspiration for the latter. The singer intended the album to show her desire for [...] "forgiveness" [...] instead of [...] "revenge". Stefani's take on her [...] "messy divorce" [...] is evident in the single [...] "Used to Love You", while tracks like [...] "Send Me a Picture" [...] and [...] "Rare" [...] find her embracing a new love. She kept the news of her divorce hidden from her writing and production teams during the recording sessions, however, Stefani [...] "suspected her collaborators knew she was in crisis because of her lyrics". When asked in a GQ interview: [...] "Did you think this project {{was going to be a}} heartbreak album? It seems like a falling-in-love album. Was that a surprise?" [...] Stefani responded:You are right. I did not think anything. I wasn’t thinking. I was feeling and I was dying. And then I was just like, You can’t go down like this! You have to turn this into music. You have to try, at least. I was so embarrassed by just everything. I just didn’t want to be that person that just went down after all of that.
