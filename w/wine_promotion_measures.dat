Especially the customers’ purchase decision determines whether an innovation like electromobility will be eventually successful. The objective of this paper covers the investigation of consumer’s attitude towards electric vehicles and their opinion on potential <b>promotion</b> <b>measures</b> {{and its impact on}} market penetration scenarios in different countries. The aforementioned issues were investigated via a European wide online consumer survey. It was designed to identify the awareness of potential consumers of electric cars as well as to discover their attitude towards this new technology. In addition to the picture of potential demand-related obstacles, the consumers were asked to evaluate the suitability of various <b>promotion</b> <b>measures.</b> Finally, the findings were included in an agent based vehicle market model which specifies consumer demand and market supply of electromobility scenarios. The results show that the consumer attitude towards electromobility is rather positive and electric vehicles are generally perceived as environment-friendly and secure. But the high acquisition costs and the uncertainty about the operating costs deter consumers from purchasing an electric car. First results of the inclusion of potential <b>promotion</b> <b>measures</b> such as financial incentives in a scenario based market model show a significant increase of the electric vehicle uptake in Germany. Potential customers have high expectations regarding the comfort and range of an electric vehicle. One of the most important barriers and obstacles for a broad market uptake are the currently high purchase prices for this new technology. Therefore, it seems quite necessary to make electric vehicles from a customer’s standpoint more attractive. From the customer’s perspective a dense network of charging stations and financial measures such as tax and energy cost reductions are vital prerequisites in order to convince them to buy an electric vehicle. Finally, it has been proven within a scenario based market model for Germany that the use of different <b>promotion</b> <b>measures</b> by the national government can enhance the market share of electric vehicles substantially until 2030...|$|R

Methods: Analyzed variables in this study were those in previous studies reported had statistical significant with the number of ambulance use, as well as dummy variables represented year. These variables involved population and the number of household, the proportion of population aged 65 or over, the population of foreigners, proportion of livelihood protection recipients, regional health <b>promotion</b> <b>measures,</b> the proportion of health-checkups user, the number of retained motor vehicles.

40|$|Among EU 15 {{countries}} Finland {{has witnessed}} the largest {{increase in the}} employment of ageing workers since the late 1990 s. In these years there was a rapid change from the policy of promoting early retirement to the policy of promoting staying at work. Furthermore, this rapid shift to a restrictive early exit policy took place in a situation that was especially demanding due to exceptionally high unemployment among elderly employees. This paper considers why and how the Finnish policy has been successful earlier than other EU countries in encouraging ageing workers to stay on at work. We argue that the positive change in employment is an outcome of the interplay between favourable economic trends and wide-scale work <b>promotion</b> <b>measures.</b> These work <b>promotion</b> <b>measures</b> include the restrictive changes in early retirement schemes.

40|$|Background: People {{working in}} social care {{constitute}} the largest occupational group in Sweden {{and they have}} the highest prevalence of sickness absence. Since sickness absence results in great human and societal costs, there is incentive to develop initiatives to promote health for this group. Previous research about both what measures are effective and how soon effects occur are limited and more knowledge about this is needed. Aim: The overall aim of the thesis was to gain more knowledge about associations between workplace health promotion and employee health, sickness absence, and sickness presence in municipal social care organizations. Method: Four studies were conducted concerning social care organizations and their employees in 60 Swedish municipalities, based on data from registers as well as from surveys to employees, top managers, and policy makers, respectively. A randomized sample of 60 of the 290 municipalities in Sweden and a randomized sample of 15, 871 people employed at least half time throughout 2006 within the social care sector in these 60 municipalities was used. A questionnaire was sent to the employees selected (9270) and 58 % replied (study I-IV). Another questionnaire was sent to top managers who represented the employer in the same 60 municipalities (n= 60) (study II). A third questionnaire was sent to policymakers in the 60 municipalities (study III). Register data was obtained on sickness absence (> 14 days) in 2006 for the 9270 employees and on long-term sickness absence (> 90 days) in 2007 – 2012 for all social service workers in the 60 municipalities. Both cross-sectional (study I–II and IV) and prospective (study III) study designs were used, using individual level data (study IV) and organizational level data (study I-III). Descriptive statistics, bivariate and multiple linear and logistic regression analyses, and structural equation modelling analyses were performed. Results: Organizations that had more favorable employee ratings of individual- and organizational-directed (psychosocial work conditions) workplace health <b>promotion</b> <b>measures</b> had better health and lower sickness absence levels among their employees (study I). Organizational- and individual-directed workplace health <b>promotion</b> <b>measures</b> and employee satisfaction with workplace health <b>promotion</b> <b>measures</b> were associated with better employee health (study II). There was an association between provision of organizational-directed workplace health <b>promotion</b> <b>measures</b> (prevention program) and future lower levels of long-term sickness absence (study III). There were associations present between the use of health profile assessment and fitness activities and a lower odds ratio of being sickness present (study IV). Conclusions: There were low or moderate associations between provision/use of workplace health promotion for individual and/or organizational approaches and lower levels of poor self-rated health, lower future incidence of long-term sickness absence, and lower odds ratio for sickness presence...|$|R

The usage of local dialects in all other spheres is officially tolerated. Standardization of dialects, however, may be perceived as a precursor to possible regionalism, so this, too, would most likely be deterred. On the other hand, few speakers consider their dialect important enough to be written or standardized. To most speakers, dialects are in essence a wholly oral phenomenon.|$|R

The study sample comprised the end-users {{of the health care}} system, together with 3 multidisciplinary teams. A total of 77 health care users and 55 health professionals participated in the study. Measures Culture circles composed of health care professionals, and users from different areas investigated generative topics, encoded/decoded topics, and engaged in critical probing for clarification.

The nation, although not a Party to the Montreal Protocol and Kyoto Protocol, has diligently striven to mitigate and phase out them. The landfill gas (LFG), which is now considered as a renewable energy with emphasis on electricity generation, has been {{recognized as one of}} the main GHGs emissions associated with its composition mostly consisting of methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2). The objective of this paper is to present an updated overview of LFG-to-electricity in Taiwan. The description is thus centered on biogas sources and their energy utilizations, and then aimed at MSW generation and management. Using the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommended methodology, anthropogenic methane emissions from MSW landfills in Taiwan during 1992 - 2003 were estimated to be around 360 thousand metric tons annually during 1992 - 1999, then decreased to approximately 103 thousand metric tons in 2003 due to the MSW recycling and incineration policies during this period. The <b>promotion</b> <b>measures</b> relating to LFG-to-electricity are also summarized in the paper.
