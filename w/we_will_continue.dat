The Military Commissions Act of 2006 will allow the continuation of a CIA program that {{has been one of}} America's most potent tools in fighting the War on Terror. Under this program, suspected terrorists have been detained and questioned about threats against our country. Information we have learned from the program has helped save lives at home and abroad. By authorizing the creation of military commissions, the Act will also allow us to prosecute suspected terrorists for war crimes.|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of Wipeout Pure on the PlayStation Portable, rumours {{circulated}} that a port was in development for the PlayStation 2. In January 2009, Sony issued a statement saying: [...] "There are over 9.5 million PS2s in the UK and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> to support this large userbase with software on an ongoing basis".

It's been {{a little}} frustrating {{in the past for}} us to hear people say, 'Oh yeah, the Insomniac game is running on the Naughty Dog engine.' People assumed that we were using Naughty Dog's engine for Ratchet, and that was not true.

They had also won the FA Charity Shield {{at the start of}} the current season. Manager Gérard Houllier congratulated his players on their achievements: [...] "I must congratulate the players for what they achieved in these six months. We know we are not perfect and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> to improve. But the team have shown they possess the winning edge, and this is what we have tried to develop."

500|$|In November 2010, the State Duma (lower {{house of}} the Russian parliament) passed a {{resolution}} declaring that long-classified documents [...] "showed that the Katyn crime was carried out on direct orders of Stalin and other Soviet officials". The declaration also called for the massacre to be investigated further in order to confirm the list of victims. Members of the Duma from the Communist Party denied that the Soviet Union had been {{to blame for the}} Katyn massacre and voted against the declaration. On 6 December 2010, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev expressed commitment to uncovering the whole truth about the massacre, stating [...] "Russia has recently taken a number of unprecedented steps towards clearing up the legacy of the past. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> in this direction".|$|E
500|$|In 1998 Qandil responded {{favorably to}} the {{invitation}} of Safwat El-Sherif, the Information Minister in Hosni Mubarak's government, to return to Egyptian television. In March his program Ra'is el-Tahrir ("Editor-in-Chief") began airing. Qandil stated he returned to Egyptian television because he felt he owed [...] "a debt of gratitude to the institution that built my fame when I was in my twenties. Also, working in Egypt is more immediately rewarding than anywhere else." [...] With the relaxation of media restrictions during this period, Ra'is el-Tahrir {{became one of the}} most popular and respected television programs in Egypt. Describing the relative freedom afforded to the media, Qandil stated in 2001 that the situation was an improvement from when he first began the program, but [...] "as long as there remains a censor, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> to ask for more [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|Outgoing Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta {{defended the}} award's precedence, saying [...] "Our {{military}} reserves its highest decorations obviously {{for those who}} display gallantry and valor in actions when their lives {{are on the line}} and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> to do so. But we should also have the ability to honor the extraordinary actions that make a true difference in combat operations. The contribution they make does contribute to the success of combat operations, particularly when they remove the enemy from the field of battle, even if those actions are physically removed from the fight." [...] Pentagon spokesman, Lieutenant Commander Nate Christensen, added, [...] "Extraordinary achievement directly impacting combat operations at this level deserves to be recognized with a distinctive medal, not a device on an existing medal. The DWM is visionary in that it fills a need for a non-valorous combat impact medal." ...|$|E

[...] Jed Whedon added, [...] "There are always ideas {{in the back of}} your mind for how you'd wrap it up when they say, 'That's it guys,' but we're not there just yet." [...] By May 2017, Bell noted they had [...] "a sense of how we'd like the show to end when it ends. We just need to know when that time is coming so we can build to it properly." [...] Jed Whedon continued, [...] "Our goal is to know ahead of time, because we would love to land the story in a way that's satisfying".|$|E
500|$|When Taylor {{said the}} moves detracted from Hương and Suu's powers, the {{officers}} disagreed {{and said they}} supported the pair in full and that Hương had approved of the HNC's dissolution. Taylor was unimpressed by the reassurances, concluding with [...] "I don't know whether <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> to support you after this...You people have broken a lot of dishes {{and now we have}} to see how we can straighten out this mess." [...] Taylor's deputy, U. Alexis Johnson felt the discussion had become counterproductive and was increasing the problem. He suggested that should the generals feel unwilling to alter their position immediately, they should refrain from actions that would preclude a later change of heart. He proposed they merely announce the removal of certain members of the HNC rather than the dissolution of the entire body, hoping the HNC could be reconstituted with figures they deemed to be more satisfactory. The four officers did not give a clear answer to Johnson's idea, indicating they had not made a concrete decision by saying [...] "the door is not closed".|$|E

500|$|As the day moved on, the Twin Cities, Sioux Falls and La Crosse NWS {{forecast}} offices all saw {{the potential}} for [...] "strong to violent" [...] tornadoes, and used such verbiage in their forecasts. The Twin Cities NWS noted in their 12:26pm forecast discussion that [...] "thunderstorms located south of a Redwood Falls to Minneapolis to Rice Lake line could be particularly strong with the potential of tornadic thunderstorms". Just before 12:00pm, the Storm Prediction Center issued a mesoscale discussion stating that [...] "iven strength of vertical shear profiles, CAPE {{on the order of}} 2000J/kg will support increasing potential for tornadic supercells during the afternoon hours, especially along an axis roughly from Yankton through Sioux Falls into Redwood Falls and Minneapolis/Rochester areas. <b>We</b> <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> to monitor.

In January 2010, Wade and Alonzo Mourning co-founded The Athletes Relief Fund for Haiti", which raised money to help the victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In the three days since the fund began soliciting donations from athletes, Wade announced that the [...] "Athletes Relief Fund for Haiti" [...] had already raised over $800,000.
