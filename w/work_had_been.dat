5|$|As of 2006 {{extensive}} restoration <b>work</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{completed on}} the home. The front porch was repaired and restored and inside, the hardwood floors {{have been replaced}} and refinished. In addition, the front parlors have been repainted and restored.|$|E
5|$|By 1807, further {{investigation}} revealed two new {{objects in the}} region: Juno and Vesta. The burning of Lilienthal in the Napoleonic wars, where {{the main body of}} <b>work</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> done, brought this first period of discovery to a close.|$|E

50|$|Carlos Ruiz Zafón's <b>works</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{published}} in 45 countries and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> translated {{into more than}} 40 different languages. According to these figures, Ruiz Zafón is the most widely published contemporary Spanish writer, followed by Javier Sierra, whose <b>works</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{published in}} 42 countries, and Juan Gómez-Jurado, whose <b>works</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> published in 41 countries.|$|R
5|$|With {{funds in}} place, {{construction}} of the BS was quickly restarted. 50 per cent of the tunnelling and 25 per cent of the station <b>work</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> completed before <b>work</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> stopped, and by February 1904 {{virtually all of the}} tunnels and underground parts of the stations between Elephant & Castle and Marylebone were complete and works on the station buildings were under way. Construction of the GNP and the CCE began in July 1902 and proceeded quickly so that the UERL was able to record in its annual report in October 1904 that 80 per cent of the GNP's and 75 per cent of the CCE's tunnels had been completed.|$|E
5|$|BWV Anh. 30 is a Magnificat in C major for SSAATTBB {{choir and}} orchestra, copied by Bach around 1742. The {{manuscript}} score indicates no composer, {{but according to}} a 2012 study it is a 17th-century work, composed by Pietro Torri before his 25th birthday. An earlier attribution of the <b>work</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> to Antonio Lotti.|$|E
5|$|Feuchtwanger {{was horrified}} and incensed {{at the way}} in which his <b>work</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{manipulated}} and distorted, calling Harlan's film a Schandwerk ("a shameful work"). In 1941, he wrote an open letter to seven actors. Based on the sentiments expressed in the letter, it appears that Feuchtwanger was shocked that these men, whom he considered colleagues and who he knew were familiar with his work, would agree to participate in Goebbels' antisemitic propaganda film.|$|E
50|$|Kirby's <b>work</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{featured}} in news outlets and media.

5|$|In late 1958, Ernest Hemingway {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} produce a film version of Burnham's memoirs, Scouting on Two Continents. CBS immediately contracted Hemingway to produce the film for television, with Gary Cooper expressing considerable interest in playing the part of Burnham. Hemingway was already behind schedule with other commitments, however, and no <b>work</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> done on the movie when he committed suicide in July 1961.|$|E
5|$|As he {{had when}} he {{directed}} The Wrath of Khan, Meyer attempted to modify the look of Star Trek to fit his vision. Cinematographer Hiro Narita's previous <b>work</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> on effects films such as The Rocketeer, where he had {{time and money to}} make a lavish period fantasy; with The Undiscovered Country, he was constantly under time and budgetary pressures. Though Narita confessed that he knew nothing about Star Trek, Meyer replied {{that he did not want}} him to have any preconceived notions about the look of the series.|$|E
5|$|At one time, {{the church}} on this site {{was used as a}} chapel of ease to Llantrisant church. In the 15th century, St Mary's Church, Rhodogeidio, was built to serve as a chapel of ease for St Ceidio's. In 2006, one author noted that St Ceidio's had not been {{regularly}} used for some years, but restoration <b>work</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> carried out by local people. St Mary's, which is about 0.75miles (1.25km) to the west, is no longer used for services either, but is in ruins.|$|E
50|$|Alexander Selin's {{literary}} <b>works</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{published in}} {{a great number of}} magazines, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> read in public and shooting of some films based on A. Selin's <b>works</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> planned.|$|R

5|$|At {{the time}} of the book's initial print {{publication}} date, its editor Andrew Altman worked as Professor of Philosophy at Georgia State University and concurrently as Director of Research at the Jean Beer Blumenfeld Center for Ethics. Claire Finkelstein was the Algernon Biddle Professor of Law and Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania and concurrently as co-director of the University of Pennsylvania Institute of Law and Philosophy. Jens David Ohlin was employed as an Associate Professor of Law at Cornell Law School. Ohlin's <b>work</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> published in academic journals, including the American Journal of International Law, the Columbia Law Review, and the Harvard International Law Journal. He wrote the 2008 book Defending Humanity: When Force is Justified and Why with George Fletcher, which was also published by Oxford University Press.|$|E
5|$|Bach led {{the first}} {{performance}} on 1 June 1727 in the Nikolaikirche. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann notes that a printed libretto for the congregation was recently {{found in the}} Russian National Library in St. Petersburg, containing the texts for the three feast days of Pentecost and Trinity of 1727. Until then the <b>work</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> dated much later, such as 1746 when a revival took place for which performance material exists. As {{the music of the}} 1727 version is lost, the timing of Bach's revisions to the wedding cantata is not known. It is likely that he revised it further in the 1740s because he wrote a new score.|$|E
5|$|Deal Castle {{continued}} {{to be used as}} a military fortification throughout the 18th century, and in 1728 it was equipped with 11 culverin guns. The following year, however, the captain, naval officer Sir John Norris, redeveloped the castle to improve his personal accommodation. Similar <b>work</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> carried out at Walmer in 1708 by the Duke of Dorset, Lionel Sackville, and there may have been some competition between the two men. The keep was redesigned with medieval-style battlements, and wood-panelled accommodation at the rear overlooking the sea; the porter's lodge was also updated.|$|E
50|$|Dea Loher's <b>work</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{the subject}} of scholarship, most notably in Birgit Haas' Das Theater von Dea Loher: Brecht und (k)ein Ende. Her <b>works</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{translated}} into French, English and Spanish.|$|R

5|$|Following the {{realization}} in February 1915 {{that the war}} would not be won quickly, the Navy department decided to replace the six armored cruisers that had been lost thus far. The ships were improved versions of the Derfflinger class; the primary alterations being {{the adoption of the}} 35cm (13.8in) gun for the main battery, along with a full-length forecastle deck. Four ships were ordered and laid down, but only two of them, Mackensen and Graf Spee, were launched. None of the ships were completed, as <b>work</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> diverted to U-boat construction. All four ships were broken up in Germany between 1921 and 1924.|$|E
5|$|However, in 1726 Sheffield's Company of Cutlers sought {{parliamentary}} {{approval to}} make the river navigable from Holmstile in Doncaster to Tinsley, {{on the edge of}} Sheffield. Terminating at Tinsley placated the Duke of Norfolk, who represented the opposition from Sheffield, {{and a great deal of}} <b>work</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> done to reduce the opposition from landowners. The Act of Parliament was passed on 6 May 1726 giving the Cutlers powers to make cuts and {{to make the}} river deeper and wider so that boats of 20 tonnes could reach Tinsley. There were a number of restrictions, intended to protect existing water-powered installations. Lord Frederick Howard's mills at Rotherham, Kilnhurst forge, Thrybergh dam and Sprotborough mills and water engine were specifically mentioned.|$|E
5|$|In January 1950, the New York Zoological Society held {{a celebration}} {{to commemorate the}} 50th anniversary of Beebe's work for them. He was by this point the only {{remaining}} member of the zoo's original staff, and had produced more scholarly papers and publicity than any other employee. Letters and testimonials poured in from other scientists with whom Beebe had worked, attesting to their admiration {{of him and his}} influence on them. One letter from the Harvard biologist Ernst Mayr wrote that Beebe's <b>work</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> an inspiration to his own, particularly A Monograph of the Pheasants and Beebe's books about jungle wildlife.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{his poems}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> set {{to music and}} several of his <b>works</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{translated}} into other languages. His Complete <b>Works</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> published by the Society for the Dissemination of Beneficial Books (Σ.Ω.Β.).|$|R

5|$|In October 2008, Nassau County Legislator David Denenberg {{demonstrated}} {{with ten}} civic leaders {{in front of}} the NYSDOT building in East Meadow about the slow progress of construction on the NY102 (Front Street) overpass. Construction was causing rush hour traffic to back up for miles near the Hempstead Turnpike (NY24) exit, and evidence showed no <b>work</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> done for several months. After residents and commuters started demanding answers, NYSDOT stated that a project that began as just basic bridge repair had become a larger-scale project that required a redesign {{due to the fact that}} the bridge had more damage than initially realized.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>work</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{completed}} by the dedication, and Six Companies negotiated with the government through late 1935, and early 1936, to settle all claims and arrange for the formal transfer of the dam to the Federal Government. The parties came to an agreement and on March 1, 1936, Secretary Ickes formally accepted the dam {{on behalf of the}} government. Six Companies was not required to complete work on one item, a concrete plug for one of the bypass tunnels, as the tunnel had to be used to take in irrigation water until the powerhouse went into operation.|$|E
5|$|Slavery was not {{abolished}} {{even after}} the Thirteenth Amendment. There were four million freedmen {{and most of them}} on the same plantation, doing the same work that they did before emancipation, except as their <b>work</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> interrupted and changed by the upheaval of war. Moreover, they were getting about the same wages and apparently were going to be subject to slave codes modified only in name. There were among them thousands of fugitives in the camps of the soldiers or {{on the streets of the}} cities, homeless, sick, and impoverished. They had been freed practically with no land nor money, and, save in exceptional cases, without legal status, and without protection.|$|E
