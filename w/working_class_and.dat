5|$|Periodically, anarchism {{became popular}} among the <b>working</b> <b>class,</b> <b>and</b> was far {{stronger}} in Spain {{than anywhere else}} in Europe at the time. Anarchists were easily defeated in clashes with government forces.|$|E
5|$|The Reform Act did not enfranchise {{the working}} class since voters were {{required}} to possess property worth £10, a substantial sum at the time. This split the alliance between the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> the middle class, giving rise to the Chartist Movement.|$|E
5|$|The Knights of Columbus is the world's largest Catholic fraternal service organization. Founded by Father Michael J. McGivney in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1882, it {{was named}} in honor of the {{explorer}} Christopher Columbus. Originally serving as a mutual benefit society to <b>working</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> immigrant Catholics in the United States, it developed into a fraternal benefit society dedicated to providing charitable services, including war and disaster relief, promoting Catholic education and Catholic public policy positions, and actively defending Catholicism in various nations.|$|E

5|$|The album's lyrics {{have been}} {{described}} as an anthematic examination of the struggles of the American <b>working</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> politically liberal. Along with highlighting the struggles of blue-collar America, the lyrics portray {{the idea that there is}} hope even when things appear to be bleak and that giving up is not an option. While there are Christian themes throughout the songs, neither Christian nor secular reviewers found them to be preachy.|$|E
5|$|Horsefield founded {{one such}} society, the Prestwich Botanical Society, {{and was later}} {{president}} of a larger botanical society covering a wide area around north Manchester. He made several botanical discoveries and cultivated two new plants. A number of his writings about the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> also some poetry were published, but nothing concerning botany other than {{in connection with the}} subject of the working class. He lived most of his life near Whitefield in Lancashire, in dire poverty. At {{the time of his death}} he had been married for 42 years and had fathered eleven children.|$|E
5|$|Many early Northern sports {{players were}} <b>working</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> needed to miss work to play, with their teams {{compensating}} them for lost wages. By contrast, Southern teams, drawing from {{the traditions of}} public schools and Oxbridge, put great emphasis on amateurism and the Southern-dominated governing bodies forbade payments to players. This tension shaped the sports of association football and cricket, {{and led to the}} schism between the two main forms of rugby. The North is also associated with the animal sports of dog racing with whippets, pigeon racing and ferret legging, although these are now far more popular in stereotype than in reality.|$|E

5|$|Palatial squares were {{developed}} for the prosperous middle classes. Italianate and Grecian villas, made with Bath Stone and sitting in their own gardens, were built {{in areas such as}} Clifton Down. At the same time, hundreds of acres of <b>working</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> artisan homes were built, especially in the south and east of the city. To support the growing population, public service buildings such as the Beaufort Hospital (now Glenside), schools such as Clifton College and public houses such as the Mauretania Public House were constructed.|$|E
5|$|Houston is {{considered}} to be a politically divided city whose balance of power often sways between Republicans and Democrats. Much of the city's wealthier areas vote Republican while the city's <b>working</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> minority areas vote Democratic. According to the 2005 Houston Area Survey, 68percent of non-Hispanic whites in Harris County are declared or favor Republicans while 89 percent of non-Hispanic blacks in the area are declared or favor Democrats. About 62percent of Hispanics (of any race) in the area are declared or favor Democrats. The city has often been known to be the most politically diverse city in Texas, a state known for being generally conservative. As a result, the city is often a contested area in statewide elections. In 2009, Houston became the first US city with a population over 1 million citizens to elect a gay mayor, by electing Annise Parker.|$|E
5|$|Initially, in the KOR's tradition, Solidarity was an ostensibly non-political {{movement}} {{aiming at}} reconstruction of civil society. Suddenly thrust into legal existence and prominence in 1980, Solidarity and the Polish opposition in general lacked a constructive program or consensus regarding further developments. In 1981, Solidarity accepted {{the necessity of}} a political role and helped form a broad anti-ruling system social movement, dominated by the <b>working</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> with members ranging from people associated with the Catholic Church to non-communist leftists. The union was backed by intellectual dissidents, including the KOR, and adhered to a policy of nonviolent resistance. According to Karol Modzelewski, the Solidarity of 1980–81 was permeated by the idea of brotherhood between intelligentsia and workers. In the areas of ideology and politics, Solidarity followed the lead of its associated opposition intellectuals.|$|E

5|$|Mobile {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of museums. Battleship Memorial Park is a {{military}} park on the shore of Mobile Bay and features the World War II era battleship , the World War II era submarine , Korean War and Vietnam War Memorials, and a variety of historical military equipment. The History Museum of Mobile showcases 300 plus years of Mobile history and prehistory. It is housed in the historic Old City Hall (1857), a National Historic Landmark. The Oakleigh Historic Complex features three house museums that attempt to interpret the lives of people from three strata of 19th century society in Mobile, that of the enslaved, the <b>working</b> <b>class,</b> <b>and</b> the upper class. The Mobile Carnival Museum, housing the city's Mardi Gras history and memorabilia, documents the variety of floats, costumes, and displays seen during the history of the festival season. The Bragg-Mitchell Mansion (1855), Richards DAR House (1860), and the Condé-Charlotte House (1822) are historic, furnished antebellum house museums. Fort Morgan (1819), Fort Gaines (1821), and Historic Blakeley State Park all figure predominantly in local American Civil War history.|$|E
5|$|With Kirchner leading all the pre-election polls {{by a wide}} margin, her challengers {{focused on}} forcing her into a ballotage. To win in a single round, a presidential {{candidate}} in Argentina needs either more than 45% of the vote, or 40% of the vote and a lead of more than 10 percentage points over the runner-up. However, with 13 challengers splitting the vote, Kirchner won the election decisively {{in the first round}} with just over 45% of the vote, followed by 23% for Elisa Carrió (candidate for the Civic Coalition) and 17% for former Economy Minister Roberto Lavagna. Kirchner was popular among the suburban <b>working</b> <b>class</b> <b>and</b> the rural poor, while Carrió and Lavagna both received more support from the urban middle class. Kirchner lost the election in the large cities of Buenos Aires and Rosario.|$|E

5000|$|Historically, {{because of}} the amount of leisure time and {{education}} required to write extensive works like novels, most novelists have come from communities with large economic or cultural capital, such as the upper classes or college educated middle class. However, some groups of novelists made their reputation as being from the <b>working</b> <b>classes,</b> <b>and</b> thus are treated as representing that portion of the population. For example, the writers identified as the [...] "Angry young men" [...] of the 1950s in British literary circles, included a number of novelists, such as Alan Sillitoe and Kingsley Amis, whose background, identity as authors, and literary subject matter focused on the <b>working</b> <b>classes</b> <b>and</b> had foundations in <b>working</b> <b>class</b> culture.|$|R
60|$|You {{have given}} {{a great deal of}} {{gratuitous}} instruction to the working classes?--Not so much to the <b>working</b> <b>classes</b> as to the class which especially attends the lectures on drawing, but which of course is connected with the <b>working</b> <b>classes,</b> <b>and</b> through which I know something about them.|$|R
50|$|Historians {{have also}} {{emphasized}} {{his attention to}} the fate of the <b>working</b> <b>classes</b> <b>and</b> poor people. His book Extinction du paupérisme ("Extinction of pauperism"), which he wrote while imprisoned at the Fort of Ham in 1844, contributed greatly to his popularity among the <b>working</b> <b>classes</b> <b>and</b> thus his election in 1848. Throughout his reign the emperor worked to alleviate the sufferings of the poor, on occasion breaching the 19th-century economic orthodoxy of freedom and laissez-faire and using state resources or interfering in the market. Among other things, the Emperor granted the right to strike to French workers in 1864, despite intense opposition from corporate lobbies.|$|R
