5|$|Both entrances {{will feature}} the glass canopy design, {{the first of}} their kind in the subway system. They are {{intended}} to stand out aesthetically. The entrances are interweaved with the Hudson Yards developments, with the main entrance <b>wedged</b> <b>between</b> 50 Hudson Yards {{to the east and}} 55 Hudson Yards to the west. The rest of the Hudson Yards development is located very close to the south of the station. Both entrances are based on a design by architect Toshiko Mori, which itself is based on the design of smaller station entrances in the Paris Métro.|$|E
5|$|Wall {{construction}} {{continued until}} {{the demise of}} the Ming dynasty in 1644. In the decades that led to the fall of the Ming dynasty, the Ming court and the Great Wall itself had to deal with simultaneous internal rebellions and the Manchu invasions. In addition to their conquest of Liaodong, the Manchus had raided across the Great Wall {{for the first time in}} 1629, and again in 1634, 1638, and 1642. Meanwhile, the rebels led by warlord Li Zicheng had been gathering strength. In the early months of 1644, Li Zicheng declared himself the founder of the Shun and marched towards the Ming capital from Shaanxi. His route roughly followed the line of the Great Wall, in order to neutralize its heavily fortified garrisons. The crucial defences of Datong, Xuanfu, and Juyong Pass all surrendered without a fight, and the Chongzhen Emperor hanged himself on 25 April as the Shun army entered Beijing. At this point, the largest remaining Ming fighting force in North China was in Shanhai Pass, where the Great Wall meets the Bohai Sea. Its defender Wu Sangui, <b>wedged</b> <b>between</b> the Shun army within and the Manchus without, decided to surrender to the Manchus and opened the gates for them. The Manchus, having thus entered through the Great Wall, defeated Li Zicheng at the Battle of Shanhai Pass and seized Beijing on June5. They eventually defeated both the rebel-founded Shun dynasty and the remaining Ming resistance, establishing their rule over all of China as the Qing dynasty.|$|E

Although {{he planned to}} proceed directly to Saint Petersburg, stormy weather induced him to enter the Tagus River and cast anchor in Lisbon on 30 October. Within several days, John VI of Portugal fled to the Portuguese colony of Brazil and the Royal Navy blockaded Lisbon, intercepting a Russian sloop as an enemy vessel: the Anglo-Russian War had been declared. In November, French forces under Duc d'Abrantès overran the Portuguese capital and Senyavin found himself <b>wedged</b> <b>between</b> two warring powers.|$|E
25|$|Neptun began {{salvaging}} the grounded Sampo in May 1940 by emptying {{the coal}} storages and melting the ice masses inside the vessel with steam.

The icebreaker arrived in Turku on the Midsummer Eve of 1940 and after emergency repairs was towed to Hietalahti shipyard in Helsinki, where it remained for extensive repairs until 13 March 1941.|$|E

25|$|Up {{until the}} 1980s, {{the most common}} {{mounting}} system used twisted strips of cowhide as rope. The skin was attached with rings made of cowhide; one ring was sown into {{the perimeter of the}} skin and a second ring placed below it, with loops holding the skin in place and securing the two rings together. A long strip of cowhide was used to lace up the drum, applying tension between the top ring and a third ring placed around the stem. To apply further tension, the vertical sections of the rope were woven into a diamond pattern that shortens the verticals. Wooden pegs <b>wedged</b> <b>between</b> the shell and the lacing could be used to increase tension still further.|$|E
25|$|Anatolia's {{terrain is}} {{structurally}} complex. A central massif composed of uplifted blocks and downfolded troughs, covered by recent deposits {{and giving the}} appearance of a plateau with rough terrain, is <b>wedged</b> <b>between</b> two folded mountain ranges that converge in the east. True lowland is confined to a few narrow coastal strips along the Aegean, Mediterranean, and Black Sea coasts. Flat or gently sloping land is rare and largely confined to the deltas of the Kızıl River, the coastal plains of Çukurova and the valley floors of the Gediz River and the Büyük Menderes River as well as some interior high plains in Anatolia, mainly around Lake Tuz (Salt Lake) and the Konya Basin (Konya Ovasi).|$|E

Gate (adjacent to the Team Disney Anaheim building), Harbor Pointe (from Harbor Boulevard), and Winston Gate (from Disneyland Drive). Berm Road encircles the park from Firehouse Gate (behind the Main Street Fire Station) to Egghouse Gate (adjacent to the Disneyland Opera House). The road is so called because it generally follows outside the path of Disneyland's berm. A stretch of the road, <b>wedged</b> <b>between</b> Tomorrowland and Harbor Boulevard, is called Schumacher Road. It has two narrow lanes and runs underneath the Monorail track. There are also two railroad bridges that cross Berm Road: one behind City Hall and the other behind Tomorrowland.|$|E

25|$|Internally, {{the cello}} has two {{important}} features: a bass bar, which is {{glued to the}} underside of the top of the instrument, and a round wooden sound post, a solid wooden cylinder which is <b>wedged</b> <b>between</b> the top and bottom plates. The bass bar, found under the bass foot of the bridge, serves to support the cello's top and distribute the vibrations from the strings to the body of the instrument. The sound post, found under the treble side of the bridge, connects the back and front of the cello. Like the bridge, the sound post is not glued, but is kept in place by the tensions of the bridge and strings. Together, the bass bar and sound post transfer the strings' vibrations to the top (front) of the instrument (and to a lesser extent the back), acting as a diaphragm to produce the instrument's sound.|$|E
25|$|The town of Peñamiller {{is a small}} {{community}} of less than 1,100 as of 2005, located in {{the west of the}} municipality at an altitude of 1330 meters. The town is <b>wedged</b> <b>between</b> mountains and the banks of the Extoraz River. It was founded and named by José de Escandón {{in the middle of the}} 18th century. He named it Peña Mellera as the mountain now known as Picacho just east of the town reminded him of a similar formation in the Peñamellera Bajo in Spain. Inside and just outside the town there are many walnut trees. Just further out there are many tall cactus and buzzards can frequently be seen circling in the air riding on warm air currents. Many of the town’s roads are still dirt. The main church building dates from the 19th century and the municipal palace building is one of the oldest in the town. The municipal seat has one public library called the Biblioteca Pública Municipal Lic. Benito Juárez. It offers lending of books with home delivery, research help, guided tours, story hours for children and digital services.|$|E
