2500|$|Christgau {{was born}} in Greenwich Village {{and grew up in}} Queens, the son of a fireman. He has said he became a rock and roll fan when disc jockey Alan Freed moved to the city in 1954. After {{attending}} a public school in New York City, he left New York for four years to attend Dartmouth College, graduating in 1962 with a B.A. in English. While at college his musical interests turned to jazz, but he quickly returned to rock after moving back to New York. Christgau has said that Miles Davis' 1960 album Sketches of Spain initiated in him [...] "one phase of the disillusionment with jazz that resulted in my return to rock and roll". He was deeply influenced by New Journalism writers such as Gay Talese and Tom Wolfe. [...] "My ambitions <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> journalism were always, to an extent, literary", Christgau later said.|$|E
2500|$|By 1978, Wood's {{depression}} had worsened, {{and he and}} {{his wife}} Kathy had become alcoholics. They were evicted from their Hollywood apartment on Yucca Street on Thursday, December 7, 1978 in total poverty. The couple moved into the North Hollywood apartment of their friend actor Peter Coe. Wood spent the weekend drinking vodka. Around noon on Sunday, December 10, Wood felt ill and went to lie down in Coe's bedroom.

A few minutes later he yelled out, [...] "Kathy, I can't breathe!", a plea Kathy ignored as she later said she was tired of Wood's bossing her around. After hearing no movement from the bedroom for 20 minutes, Kathy sent a friend to check on Wood, who discovered him dead from a heart attack. Kathy later said, [...] "I still remember <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> that room that afternoon and he was dead, his eyes and mouth were wide open.

2500|$|In 1890, Bennett {{remained}} with the Beaneaters {{even though he}} had in 1886 joined the Brotherhood of Professional Base-Ball Players, the union that represented the players and organized the Players' League in response to unfair treatment by team owners. [...] As a member of the Brotherhood, his refusal to play in the Players' League was criticized by many of his fellow Brotherhood members. Hardy Richardson, a Brotherhood representative and former teammate of Bennett, stated that Bennett offered to sign with the Brotherhood only if he was given a three-year contract guaranteed by two responsible men. Some reports indicated that former Detroit manager Robert Leadley was paid $1,000 to convince Bennett to remain with the Beaneaters and that Bennett was himself paid a substantial signing bonus. [...] Bennett later described his ambivalence about the Players' League: [...] "I was a Brotherhood man from the first. Mrs. Bennett was strongly opposed to my going into it and before the season opened I told my friends that I could not join them, so I {{remained with}} the Boston Club. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> the Brotherhood it was a protective order and I had no idea that they intended organizing an association of their own." ...|$|E

Of course the police would arrest him at sight, and he was led toward the guardhouse. He struggled with them, but was overpowered.
