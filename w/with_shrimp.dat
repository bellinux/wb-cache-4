25|$|The {{versions}} using shrimp {{instead of}} fish are more popular; kaeng som <b>with</b> <b>shrimp</b> and cha-om omelet {{is now a}} standard dish in Thailand. Other types may include pineapple or seafood. The common point, however, is that coconut milk is not used in this sour curry.|$|E
25|$|Most of the municipality's {{population}} {{lives in the}} city proper, with most jobs located in the manufacturing and commerce sectors here. About 250,000 hectares are under cultivation in the city's outskirts, most of which is near the coast. Crops include wheat, grapes, flowers, chickpeas, alfalfa and walnuts. Livestock has been traditionally important here, especially beef cattle. Pigs, sheep, goats, horses, domestic fowl and bees are also raised here as well. Fishing is practiced along the coast <b>with</b> <b>shrimp</b> being the most important catch.|$|E
25|$|The calves remain {{dependent}} on their mothers for nursing for the first year, when their teeth appear. After this, they start to supplement their diets <b>with</b> <b>shrimp</b> and small fish. The majority of the calves continue nursing until they are 20 months old, although occasionally lactation can continue {{for more than two}} years, and lactational anoestrus may not occur. Alloparenting (care by females different from the mother) has been observed in captive belugas, including spontaneous and long-term milk production. This suggests this behaviour, which is also seen in other mammals, may be present in belugas in the wild.|$|E
40|$|This {{laboratory}} {{research was conducted}} to observe the effect liquid formulation bioinsecticide of Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium againts nymphs of brown plant hopper (BPH) (Nilaparvata lugens). The formulations used were B. bassiana producing in maize media <b>with</b> <b>shrimps</b> shell compost extract (A), Metarhizium producing in maize media <b>with</b> <b>shrimps</b> shell compost extract (B), B. bassiana producing in rice media <b>with</b> <b>shrimps</b> shell compost extract (C), Metarhizium producing in rice media <b>with</b> <b>shrimps</b> shell compost extract (D), B. bassiana producing in SDB (Saborroud Dextrose Broth) (E), and Metarhizium producing in SDB (F). Conidia density of the formulations were aplied topically at 103, 105, and 107 spores/ml. The results showed that two formulations (A and B) provided the greatest suppression (100 %) of the six formulations againts the BPH nymphs. LT 50 of the both formulations were 1, 81 and 1, 16 days, respectively. Overall, formulation A and B were the best formulation to supress the nymphs...|$|R

25|$|Two {{important}} staples in {{the diet}} are seafood and beef, the latter playing {{a larger role in}} the cuisine of Sonora than in the rest of Mexico. Beef is often cooked over an open flame, and Sonorans prefer robust cuts such as brisket and skirt steak. Machaca, or carne seca, is still enjoyed, although refrigeration has eliminated the need to dry meat. Sonora also has a reputation for producing fine cuts of beef, but the lean Spanish cattle of the colonial period have been replaced by Angus, Herefords and Holsteins. Dishes based on or usually containing beef include carne desebrada, carne con rajas verdes, burritos, carne con chile colorado, beef chorizo, carne seca, machaca, menudo, gorditas and meatballs. Seafood is an important staple, especially along the coast as there is a large variety of fish and shellfish in the Gulf of California. Seafood is generally cooked in very simple dishes, such as fish tacos, seafood soups, rice <b>with</b> <b>shrimp</b> or squid and shrimp meatballs. Favored fish include cabrilla, flounder, marlin, sardines, manta rays and various types of jacks.|$|E
25|$|In the Philippines, sweet {{potatoes}} (locally known as camote or kamote) {{are an important}} food crop in rural areas. They are often a staple among impoverished families in provinces, as they are easier to cultivate and cost less than rice. The tubers are boiled or baked in coals and may be dipped in sugar or syrup. Young leaves and shoots (locally known as talbos ng kamote or camote tops) are eaten fresh in salads <b>with</b> <b>shrimp</b> paste (bagoong alamang) or fish sauce. They can be cooked in vinegar and soy sauce and served with fried fish (a dish known as adobong talbos ng kamote), or with recipes such as sinigang. The stew obtained from boiling camote tops is purple-colored, and is often mixed with lemon as juice. Sweet potatoes are also sold as street food in suburban and rural areas. Fried {{sweet potatoes}} coated with caramelized sugar and served in skewers (camote cue) are popular afternoon snacks. Sweet potatoes are also used in a variant of halo-halo called ginatan, where they are cooked in coconut milk and sugar and mixed {{with a variety of}} rootcrops, sago, jackfruit and bilu-bilo (glutinous rice balls). Bread made from sweet potato flour is also gaining popularity. Sweet potato is relatively easy to propagate, and in rural areas that can be seen abundantly at canals and dikes. The uncultivated plant is usually fed to pigs.|$|E

2500|$|In 1991, archeologists {{suggested}} that ancient raised paved areas near the coast in Chiapas, Mexico, were platforms used for drying shrimp in the sun, and that adjacent clay hearths {{were used to}} dry the shrimp {{when there was no}} sun. The evidence was circumstantial, because the chitinous shells of shrimp are so thin they degrade rapidly, leaving no fossil remains. In 1985 Quitmyer and others found direct evidence dating back to 600 AD for shrimping off the southeastern coast of North America, by successfully identifying shrimp from the archaeological remains of their mandibles (jaws). Clay vessels <b>with</b> <b>shrimp</b> decorations have been found in the ruins of Pompeii. In the 3rd century AD, the Greek author Athenaeus wrote in his literary work, Deipnosophistae; [...] "... of all fish the daintiest is a young shrimp in fig leaves." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another Campanian dish is the {{so-called}} Russian salad (which is based on similar dishes from France), made of potatoes in mayonnaise garnished <b>with</b> <b>shrimp</b> and vegetables in vinegar. Russians call this same dish Olivier Salad, and Germans call it Italian salad. Another French-derived dish is [...] "gattò" [...] or [...] "gâteau di patate" [...] (oven-baked pie made of boiled potatoes). As with the Russian salad, Campania is home to popular seafood-based dishes, such as [...] "insalata di mare" [...] (seafood salad), [...] "zuppa di polpo" [...] (octopus soup), and [...] "zuppa di cozze" [...] (mussel soup). Other regional seafood dishes include [...] "frittelle di mare" [...] (fritters with seaweed), made with edible poseidonia algae, [...] "triglie al cartoccio" [...] (red mullet in the bag), and [...] "alici marinate" [...] (fresh anchovies in olive oil). The island of Ischia {{is famous for its}} fish dishes, as well as for cooked rabbit. Campania is also home to the lemons of Sorrento. Rapini (or Broccoli rabe), known locally as friarielli, are often used in the regional cooking. Campania also produces many nuts, especially in the area of Avellino, Salerno and Benevento. Hazelnut production is especially relevant in the province of Avellino – in Spanish, in Portuguese and in Occitan the hazelnut is respectively called avellana, avelã and avelano, after the city of Avella. That is also the case of ancient Italian avellana, which is however not in use anymore.|$|E

40|$|Four {{practical}} diets were formulated {{to contain}} 0. 05 %, {{of the following}} antioxidants: butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxy anisole (BHA), propyl gallate (PG) or ethoxyquin (ETHQ). A fifth diet, with no added antioxidant, served as a control. The diets were fed to Penaeus monodon juveniles {{to determine the effects}} of antioxidants on feed quality and growth of the animals. The results showed no significant difference (P> 0. 05) between the control and the feeds containing antioxidants in 2 -thiobarbituric acid values after 0, 30, 60, and 90 days storage, respectively. There was a significant difference by the 120 th day of storage, but no signs of physical deterioration were observed in any of the diets. The highest weight gains (704 % and 742 %) were obtained <b>with</b> <b>shrimps</b> fed diets <b>with</b> BHT and BHA, respectively, as antioxidants. Hepatopancreatic lesion formation was evident <b>with</b> <b>shrimps</b> fed diets containing antioxidants but not <b>with</b> <b>shrimps</b> fed a diet without antioxidant. <b>Shrimps</b> fed <b>with</b> BHT-added feed showed fewest lesions in the hepatopancreas. Although all shrimp samples given feed containing PG and ETHQ showed lesions, these were patchy in nature and did not affect the growth rates of the animals...|$|R
