40|$|Abstract. To {{improve the}} {{calculation}} {{accuracy of the}} <b>wrap</b> <b>angles,</b> which are key parameters for the estimation of the maximum torque of the belt system, the steady configuration of the belt was researched. The governing equations and boundary conditions of the belt steady configuration were proposed and the following factors were considered in the model: the centrifugal force, the bending stiffness and {{the gravity of the}} belt. The belt steady configuration can be solved through a proposed iteration method based on the built model. The results show the gravity of the belt plays an important role on the belt steady configuration. The <b>wrap</b> <b>angles</b> calculated from the steady configuration are much less than that from the traditional geometric analysis. Thus the maximum torque of the belt system could be overestimated in the traditional belt design theory.

40|$|A {{flat head}} and a tape {{transport}} arrangement impart a <b>wrap</b> <b>angle</b> to the tape at the upstream corner of the head. The <b>wrap</b> <b>angle,</b> corner sharpness and tape stiffness are sufficient to cause a moving tape to form a hollow bump at the upstream corner, thereby creating a hollow into which entrained air can expand, causing a subambient pressure within and downstream of the bump. This pressure keeps the tape {{in contact with the}} head. It is created without the need for a groove or complex pressure relief slot(s). No contact pressure arises at the signal exchange site due to media wrap. The highest contact pressures are developed at a wrapped upstream corner. For a tape drive, traveling in both forward and reverse, the wrap can be at both the upstream and downstream (which is the reverse upstream) corners. Heads that are not flat can also be used, if the <b>wrap</b> <b>angle</b> relative to a main surface is sufficient and not too large. The wrapped head can also be used with rotating media, such as disks (floppy and hard) and rotating heads, such as helical wound heads for video recording. Multiple flat tape bearing surfaces can be separated by grooves and/or angles. Each flat can carry heads along one or more gap lines. Multiple adjacent narrow tracks can thus be written for extreme high track density recording...|$|E

As a first step, the torque transmission in stationary situations is investigated, in which it is generally assumed that macro-slip occurs on the pair of conical sheaves with the smallest <b>wrapped</b> <b>angle.</b> In this paper, it is experimentally shown that macro-slip only occurs on the pair of conical sheaves with the smallest <b>wrapped</b> <b>angle</b> for the extreme ratios Low and OverDrive in stationary situations...|$|R

To {{determine}} {{the efficiency of}} rope blocks, {{it is necessary to}} {{determine the}} stiffness coefficient of the ropes of blocks, taking into account the classification group of the mechanism and the <b>wrapping</b> <b>angle</b> of a block by a rope. At this one should use well-tested values of the efficiency coefficients of the rope blocks, taking into account the <b>wrapping</b> <b>angle</b> of a block by a rope and the analytically found friction coefficients of the rolling bearings given to the trunnion. Methodology. The work presents the analytical method of determining the coefficient of bearing resistance of the block when it is rotated by both the inner and outer cages, as well as the design scheme of the bearing of the block. Findings. The analysis of the lubrication method effect, the operating mode of the mechanism and the <b>wrapping</b> <b>angle</b> of a block by a rope on losses in bearings was carried out for rope blocks. The corresponding comparative tables of losses are given. Analysis of the obtained calculation results allows us to establish: 1) the main resistance affecting the cable blocks efficiency is the resistance in bearings; 2) the second largest component is the stiffness losses, depending on the operating mode, the <b>wrapping</b> <b>angle</b> of a block by a rope, the type of bearing lubrication; 3) the block efficiency when rotating the inner cage is higher than rotating the outer one by about 3 % with thick lubrication and 1 M mode; 4) in the sequential location of assemblies with a rolling bearing, it is necessary to strive for the design of the assembly in which the inner cage rotates; 5) with the number of blocks up to 5, one can use the recommended definitions of block bearings in the literature with an error in the efficiency value of up to 10 %. Originality. The authors obtained values of resistances in the rolling bearings of the rope blocks and stiffness losses due to the girth of the block by the rope. In this case, dependences were used to determine the coefficient of rolling friction, obtained using the Hertz analytic dependences on determination of contact stresses and deformations, as well as the experimental values of the coefficient of rolling friction for the blocks.

40|$|In {{the paper}} machine, {{it is not}} a desired feature for the {{boundary}} layer flows in the fabric and the roll surfaces to travel into the closing nips, creating overpressure. In this thesis, the aerodynamic behavior of the grooved roll and smooth rolls is compared {{in order to understand the}} nip flow phenomena, which is the main reason why vacuum and grooved roll constructions are designed. A common method to remove the boundary layer flow from the closing nip is to use the vacuum roll construction. The downside of the use of vacuum rolls is high operational costs due to pressure losses in the vacuum roll shell. The deep grooved roll has the same goal, to create a pressure difference over the paper web and keep the paper attached to the roll or fabric surface in the drying pocket of the paper machine. A literature review revealed that the aerodynamic functionality of the grooved roll is not very well known. In this thesis, the aerodynamic functionality of the grooved roll in interaction with a permeable or impermeable wall is studied by varying the groove properties. Computational fluid dynamics simulations are utilized as the research tool. The simulations have been performed with commercial fluid dynamics software, ANSYS Fluent. Simulation results made with 3 - and 2 -dimensional fluid dynamics models are compared to laboratory scale measurements. The measurements have been made with a grooved roll simulator designed for the research. The variables in the comparison are the paper or fabric <b>wrap</b> <b>angle,</b> surface velocities, groove geometry and wall permeability. Present-day computational and modeling resources limit grooved roll fluid dynamics simulations in the paper machine scale. Based on the analysis of the aerodynamic functionality of the grooved roll, a grooved roll simulation tool is proposed. The smooth roll simulations show that the closing nip pressure does not depend on the length of boundary layer development. The surface velocity increase affects the pressure distribution in the closing and opening nips. The 3 D grooved roll model reveals the aerodynamic functionality of the grooved roll. With the optimal groove size it is possible to avoid closing nip overpressure and keep the web attached to the fabric surface in the area of the <b>wrap</b> <b>angle.</b> The groove flow friction and minor losses play a different role when the <b>wrap</b> <b>angle</b> is changed. The proposed 2 D grooved roll simulation tool is able to replicate the grooved aerodynamic behavior with reasonable accuracy. A small <b>wrap</b> <b>angle</b> predicts the pressure distribution correctly with the chosen approach for calculating the groove friction losses. With a large <b>wrap</b> <b>angle,</b> the groove friction loss shows too large pressure gradients, and the way of calculating the air flow friction losses in the groove has to be reconsidered. The aerodynamic functionality of the grooved roll is based on minor and viscous losses in the closing and opening nips as well as in the grooves. The proposed 2 D grooved roll model is a simplification in order to reduce computational and modeling efforts. The simulation tool makes it possible to simulate complex paper machine constructions in the paper machine scale. In order to use the grooved roll as a replacement for the vacuum roll, the grooved roll properties have to be considered on the basis of the web handling application...|$|E
