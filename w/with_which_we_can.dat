2500|$|To {{think about}} social {{transformation}} programmatically, one must first mark the direction one wants society to move in, and then identify {{the first steps}} <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> move in that direction. In this way we can formulate proposals at points along the trajectory, be they relatively close to how things are now or relatively far away. This provides a third way between revolution and reform. It is revolutionary reform, where one has a revolutionary vision, but acts on that vision in a sequence of piecemeal reforms. As Unger puts it, transformative politics is [...] "not about blueprints; it is about pathways. It is not architecture; it is music".|$|E
2500|$|Asymptotic {{flatness}} is an idealization, and a {{very useful}} one, both in our current [...] "Gold Standard" [...] theory of gravitation -- General Relativity—and in the simpler theory it [...] "overthrew", Newtonian gravitation. [...] One might expect that as a (so far mostly hypothetical) sequence of increasingly sophisticated theories of gravitation providing more and more accurate models of fundamental physics, these theories will become monotonically more [...] "powerful". [...] But this hope is probably naive: we should expect a monotonically increasing range of choices in making various theoretical tradeoffs, rather than monotonic [...] "improvement". [...] In particular, as our physical theories {{become more and more}} accurate, we should expect that it will become harder and harder to employ idealizations with the same ease <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> invoke them in more forgiving (that is, less restrictive) theories. [...] This is because more accurate theories necessarily demand setting up more accurate boundary conditions, which can render it difficult to see how to set up some idealization familiar in a simpler theory in a more sophisticated theory. [...] Indeed, we must expect that some idealizations admitted by previous theories may not be admitted at all by succeeding theories.|$|E
2500|$|Maimonides {{taught that}} nazirite vows must be {{observed}} {{even after the}} destruction of the Temple. Therefore, when a person takes a nazirite vow in the present era, that person must observe it forever, because there is no Temple where the person can go to offer sacrifices {{at the conclusion of the}} nazirite vow. Maimonides wrote that a nazirite vow may be observed only in the Land of Israel (as the Sages decreed that the Diaspora conveys ritual impurity, and a nazirite thus cannot observe the vow there). A person who takes a nazirite vow in the Diaspora is penalized and obligated to go to the Land of Israel and observe the nazirite vow there for the length of the vow. Accordingly, a person who takes a nazirite vow in the Diaspora in the present era is compelled to go to the Land of Israel and observe the nazirite vow there until death or until the Temple is rebuilt. (Abraham ben David (The Ra'avad), however, questioned what purpose would be served by going to the Land of Israel in the present era, as all are impure, even there, because of contact with a human corpse (or the impurity that results from a corpse) and there are no ashes from a red heifer <b>with</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> purify ourselves. Hence, the Ra'avad concluded that it is forbidden to take a nazirite vow in the present era, whether in the Diaspora or in the Land of Israel.) Maimonides taught that throughout the entire time that a nazirite is in the Diaspora, it is forbidden to drink wine, to become impure due to contact with the dead, and to cut one's hair. The nazirite must uphold all of the requirements stemming from a nazirite vow, despite the fact that the days do not count in the Diaspora. One who transgresses by drinking wine, cutting hair, or touching a corpse would be liable for lashes. Maimonides wrote that a person who says, [...] "I will be a nazirite if I do this and this" [...] or [...] "if I do not do this or this," [...] is a wicked person. But Maimonides argued that a person who takes a nazirite vow to God in a holy manner is delightful and praiseworthy, for concerning this, [...] says, [...] "The diadem of his God is upon his head. ... He is holy to God," [...] and Scripture equates him with a prophet, as [...] says, [...] "And from your sons, I will raise [...] as prophets, and from your youths, [...] as nazirites." ...|$|E
