5|$|Reubens spent a {{significant}} amount of his childhood in Oneonta, New York. As a child, Reubens frequented the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, whose winter headquarters was in Sarasota. The circus's atmosphere sparked Reubens' interest in entertainment and influenced his later work. Reubens also loved to watch reruns of I Love Lucy, which made him want to make people laugh. At age five, Reubens asked his father to build him a stage, where he and his siblings <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> plays.|$|E

25|$|Influences from B.C. {{are found}} {{throughout}} Johnny Hart's home of Broome County, New York. A PGA Tour event, the B.C. Open, took place every summer in Endicott, New York through 2005 (the final scheduled B.C. Open in 2006 was disrupted by flooding, prompting {{a change of}} venue to the Turning Stone Resort & Casino in central New York state). Each year Johnny would bring {{in a group of}} cartoonists to play in the Pro-Am. Jim Davis, Mike Peters, Mort Walker, Paul Szep, Dik Browne, John Cullen Murphy, Dean Young, Stan Drake, Brant Parker, Lynn Johnston, and entertainer Tom Smothers <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> a free show for the community, drawing and signing autographs for golf and cartooning fans.|$|E

25|$|Upon landing, {{the crew}} <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> their extravehicular {{activity}} (EVA) spacesuits and commence {{the first of}} five to seven lunar EVAs, collecting samples and deploying experiments. After completing their Lunar Sortie operations, the crew would then enter the Altair and fire the ascent stage engine to lift off from the surface, using the descent stage as a launchpad (and leaving it as a platform for future base construction). Upon entering orbit, the Altair would rendezvous and dock with the waiting Orion spacecraft, and the crew would then transfer, along with samples collected on the Moon, back to the Orion. After jettisoning the Altair, the crew would perform the Trans Earth Injection (TEI) burn for the return trip to Earth.|$|E
25|$|Bogart's father, Belmont, was a {{cardiopulmonary}} surgeon. His mother, Maud, was {{a commercial}} illustrator who received her art training in New York and France, including study with James McNeill Whistler. Later she became art {{director of the}} fashion magazine The Delineator and a militant suffragette. She used a drawing of baby Humphrey in a well-known advertising campaign for Mellins Baby Food. In her prime, she made over $50,000 a year, then a vast sum and far more than her husband's $20,000. The Bogarts lived in a fashionable Upper West Side apartment, and had an elegant cottage on a 55-acre estate on Canandaigua Lake in upstate New York. As a youngster, Humphrey's gang of friends at the lake <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> theatricals.|$|E
25|$|Brazelton {{admitted}} in a 2003 interview {{that when he}} started the comic and was unsure as to its potential longevity, he fell back on using himself and those close to him to avoid writing backstories for potentially short-lived characters. This shortcut also hamstrings Brazelton's potential for development; he cannot reveal too much back story of the characters {{out of concern for}} their counterparts' privacy, yet he can't make something up because readers will attribute the fiction to the real person. In 2009, Brazelton confessed that if he were to go back with what he knew now, he would begin again with all-original characters, despite the artificial familiarity it breeds in his fans. The main characters which have been based on real people are author Tom, his wife Cami, their beagle Truman, and Tom's friend Jared. Brazelton has gone on record saying his young son, Henry, will not be joining the comic strip because of the limitations it <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> he and his wife's characters to be responsible and parental.|$|E

500|$|In 1973 Geldray and {{his family}} moved to Palm Springs to look after his ailing stepfather; he also played {{harmonica}} in the local Trinidad Bar. A local doctor approached him after one set and asked if Geldray <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> a show at his stroke centre, which led to Geldray undertaking voluntary work teaching stroke victims to play the harmonica. Following the death of Geldray's youngest step-son, Timmy, Susan Geldray began drinking to excess, and she underwent treatment at the Betty Ford Center. Geldray subsequently volunteered to help at the clinic and qualified as a counsellor and technician. To raise funds for the clinic he started [...] "Jazz without Booze", a series of concerts, which included prominent local musicians, including Stan Getz. In 1989 Geldray published his autobiography, Goon With the Wind, using the same title as he had for his 1957 album.|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} 1905, several {{abortive}} {{attempts were made}} to produce a stage version of Little Nemo. [...] In mid-1907, Marcus Klaw and A. L. Erlanger announced they <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> an extravagant Little Nemo show for an unprecedented $100,000, with a score by Victor Herbert and lyrics by Harry B. Smith. [...] It starred midget Gabriel Weigel as Nemo, Joseph Cawthorn as Dr. Pill, and Billy B. Van as Flip. [...] Reviews were positive; it played to sold-out houses in New York and toured for two seasons. [...] McCay brought his vaudeville act to each city where Little Nemo played. [...] When the Keith circuit refused McCay to perform in Boston without a new act, McCay switched to the William Morris circuit, with a $100-a-week raise. [...] In several cities, McCay brought his son, who as publicity sat on a small throne dressed as Nemo.|$|E

500|$|The young Hepburn was a tomboy {{who liked}} to call herself Jimmy, and cut her hair short. Thomas Hepburn was eager for his {{children}} to use their minds and bodies to the limit, and taught them to swim, run, dive, ride, wrestle, and play golf and tennis. Golf became a passion of Katharine's; she took daily lessons and became very adept, reaching the semi-final of the Connecticut Young Women's Golf Championship. She loved swimming in Long Island Sound, and took ice-cold baths every morning {{in the belief that}} [...] "the bitterer the medicine, the better it was for you." [...] Hepburn was a fan of movies from a young age, and went to see one every Saturday night. She <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> plays and perform for her neighbors with friends and siblings for 50 cents a ticket {{to raise money for the}} Navajo people.|$|E
500|$|For {{their fourth}} album, Comfort Eagle, the band {{signed a deal}} with Columbia Records. Comfort Eagle was both {{produced}} and arranged by the band, and was recorded at Paradise Studios in Sacramento and Hyde Street Studios in San Francisco. Following the recording, drummer Todd Roper left the band, citing the demands extended touring <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> his time, and the commitments his two children, Griffin and Bella represented. He was replaced by Pete McNeal. The album's release was preceded by the release of its first single, [...] "Short Skirt/Long Jacket", described as a parable about [...] "the relationship between prosperity and the population boom...There's nothing more procreational than economic prosperity". An accompanying video was directed by McCrea, and recorded using the DV system; it featured vox populi recordings {{of members of the}} public listening to the song and giving their opinion. [...] "Short Skirt/Long Jacket" [...] hit number2 on the Bear Rock Top10 in Canada and number7 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks; the video became one of the 30 most requested tracks on MTV; Billboard writers later listed the video as the 5th best of 2001.|$|E
500|$|As {{the race}} for prom queen intensifies, Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink) begins campaigning against Quinn. She discovers that Quinn's first name is Lucy, and {{that she used to}} be an {{overweight}} outcast who had rhinoplasty before re-inventing herself and transferring to McKinley. Lauren attempts to sabotage Quinn's campaign by revealing her former image to the other students, but it backfires when Quinn's popularity actually increases amongst the girls like Lauren, encouraged by the idea of someone able to rise above such difficulties like she did, and become popular. Lauren apologizes to Quinn, but Quinn commends her for her confidence and pride, and the two form a bond. Brittany shows off her shirt to Santana, and gives Santana a shirt reading [...] "Lebanese", believing that it reads [...] "Lesbian". Santana balks at wearing it, and the two argue; Brittany finally storms off saying that if Santana loved herself as much as Brittany loved her, she <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> the shirt and dance with her. The episode closes with the club, minus Santana, embracing their identities and performing [...] "Born This Way". During the song, Emma arrives wearing a T-shirt that acknowledges her own problems—it reads [...] "OCD"—and she and Will join the performance. Karofsky and Santana watch from the audience, with Santana wearing her [...] "Lebanese" [...] shirt.|$|E

500|$|Writer Holly Harold {{noted that}} the {{introduction}} of Green Arrow (Justin Hartley) allowed Clark to mature more in the sixth season. Clark {{was able to see}} how others achieved the same goals, but used alternative routes that perhaps crossed moral lines. This taught Clark to start thinking about things from his opponents' perspectives. Ultimately, in season six Clark learned it would be his human side that allowed him to become the hero he needed to be, summed up by writer Turi Meyer as [...] "... soon-to-be Man of Steel". Each season, Clark gained insight into how not to misuse his abilities from the kryptonite-mutated villains that used them for crime. In later seasons, Clark saw how even those that used their abilities for good might still have questionable actions, specifically Arthur Curry (Alan Ritchson) and Andrea Rojas (Denise Quiñones), though Clark did help them take the high road. Those episodes reiterated the effect Clark's parents had on how he used his abilities. Clark also learned that he cannot do everything alone, even though he chose not to join Oliver's team of superheroes {{at the end of the}} episode [...] "Justice". For Meyer, season six showed that Clark was still struggling to accept his destiny, but did take steps toward the day that he <b>would</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> the cape and become Superman.|$|E

[...] We wanted to have things going on in the left ear and right ear all the time". One of Corgan's main goals was {{to create a sense of}} sonic depth, but, as Corgan said, [...] "without necessarily using delays or reverbs—to use tonalities instead." [...] For the album, the guitars were layered multiple times. Corgan has stated that [...] "Soma" [...] alone contains up to 40 overdubbed guitar parts. Vig stated that as many as 100 guitar parts were compressed into a single song. Rolling Stone noted that the album was [...] "closer to progressive rock than to punk or grunge." ...|$|E
