During his world tour in 1881 and upon learning of Harris's death, Kalākaua, who had also received his first instruction in law under Harris, wrote to their sister Liliʻuokalani reminiscing about their elder brother and his work as an interpreter: [...] "I feel it [...] the more when I recall the days of my childhood and that of our brother James Kaliokalani, who <b>was</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> instructor in Law and remained with him as assistant interpreter of the Police Court for two years".|$|E
500|$|Disc jockey {{and author}} Pete Fornatale writes that Bookends {{represents}} [...] "a once-in-a-career convergence of musical, personal, and societal forces that placed Simon & Garfunkel squarely {{at the center}} of the cultural zeitgeist of the sixties". Rolling Stone credited the record with striking a chord among lonely, adrift young adults near the end of the decade, writing that a lyric in [...] "A Hazy Shade of Winter" [...] — [...] "Time, time, time, see what’s become of me..." [...] — [...] "defined the moment for a generation on the edge of adulthood". Many viewed Bookends as the band's most accomplished work at the time, a breakthrough in production and songwriting. [...] "Bookends <b>was</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> serious piece of work, I'd say", said Simon in a 1984 interview with Playboy.|$|E

On July 2, 2013, Victory announced that Old Record was to be reissued again on vinyl, in 3 different colors, from July 9: standard black, and limited edition copies of both pink and clear with black smoke. In an October 2013 interview, McKinnon revealed the band had to re-record the whole album {{in a couple of days}} due to pressure from Victory-owner Tony Brummel. McKinnon was [...] "absolutely [...] ashamed" [...] it was released as he thought the band had [...] "butchered it. Because it was two days [...]" ...|$|E

Lauryn was {{in the living room}} next to the studio with about fifteen Marley grandchildren around her, the children of Ziggy, and Stephen, and Julian, and she starts singing this rap verse, and all the kids start repeating the last word of each line, chiming in very spontaneously because they were so into the song." [...] Columbia Records considered bringing in an outside producer for the album and had early talks with RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan. However, Hill was adamant about writing, arranging, and producing the album herself: [...] "It would have been more difficult to articulate to other people. Hey, it's my album. Who can tell my story better than me?" [...] She recalled Ruffhouse Records executive Chris Swartz ensuring her artistic freedom while recording the album: [...] "I had total control of the album. Chris Swartz at Ruffhouse, my label, said, 'Listen, you've never done anything stupid thus far, so let me let you do your thing.'" ...|$|E

In particular, Spruance noted that Mike Patton {{had to teach}} him to play the ska stroke for a performance at their high school talent show. Spruance later explained, [...] "Oh, what I remember was... this <b>was</b> <b>our</b> <b>first...</b> like, we had only done, uh, death metal up to that point. And so this <b>was</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> time trying to ever play ska. And I'd never played... on guitar, like, I'd never played... I didn't {{know how to do}} that skanking guitar shit at all. But Patton could do, like with one finger on the thread mark, he could do the, the rhythmic part of it pretty well. Like, he could... he taught me how to do it. So, I just sort of awkwardly... I would fill in and make the chord and he actually played guitar, but would just kind of use it percussively. And we played these Camper Van Beethoven songs, and I don't... I dunno if we played The Specials, but that's what we were listening to." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album's sexual overtones {{led to its}} {{enthusiastic}} {{acceptance in}} American gay clubs shortly after its release. Bono commented on this phenomenon, saying, [...] "First of all we started out and made Boy, which is a sexual LP, and we changed the cover in America to stop any concern there might be about paedophilia and the like, because it <b>was</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> album. But import copies got in and, as you know, in America a lot of music is broken in gay clubs {{and so we had}} a gay audience, {{a lot of people who}} were convinced the music was specifically for them. So there was a misconception if you like." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Steinhardt, {{the central}} message is not xenophobic, but [...] "ecological", [...] "anti-technicist", and [...] "obviously Heideggerian", its {{violence}} being Eminescu's attempt {{to fend off}} an [...] "ancient curse". This reading refers in particular to a line which mentions the [...] "iron road" [...] (the Austrian rail company) bringing in foreigners to [...] "kill all the songs", {{as well as to}} the claim that the forest and the Romanian are like [...] "brothers". The same lines are also highlighted by critic Barbu Cioculescu: [...] "That Eminescu <b>was</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> environmentalist is an established fact, beyond all debate [...] The construction of railways across the country's virgin plains, centenary forests, and murmuring waters drove him to despair". Ștefănescu rejects literal readings of the [...] "iron road" [...] verse, noting that Eminescu stood not for an aversion to progress, but rather against the [...] "brutal destruction of a slowly emerging harmony", an [...] "irreversible destruction of beautiful things." [...] Trains have first appeared as instruments of corruption in Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu's [...] "Iron Road" [...] (1864), which exegets such as Liviu Marian saw as [...] "quasi-identical" [...] with the passage in Doina, and which is primarily about the Strousberg scandal.|$|E

2500|$|Areas of {{difficulties}} in the game's development were memory allocation, various lighting and shadow aspects, and {{their use of the}} physics engine PhysX. According to Wataru Nishide, the lead level artist, and J's Kataoka, the lead programmer, [...] "Deadly Premonition <b>was</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> stab at next-generation development, so we began the project astounded by the vast amount of RAM available--much more than any previous consumer hardware had offered. Astonishment gave rise to overconfidence, and eventually to the worst-case scenario: our data management became sloppy." [...] The team found a balance between the practicalities of the available memory with the desired aesthetic of the outdoor sections of the game, which initially contained too many objects. The developers also had difficulties with balancing the game's lighting, desired aesthetics of the game's shadows and the processing rate. Furthermore, their use of PhysX proved to have mixed results; the developers enjoyed the [...] "dynamic expression" [...] that it gave the game's world, but had problems with the inability to [...] "cheat" [...] the [...] "brutally honest" [...] simulation and [...] the resulting toll on the frame rate and processing. Initially, the team [...] "had everything that could possibly be displayed with a physics engine running through PhysX--hair, clothing, even fishing rods", which they had to cut back to preserve the frame rate.|$|E
2500|$|In early December 2011, Clinton {{made the}} first visit to Burma by a U.S. {{secretary}} of state since John Foster Dulles's in 1955, as she met with Burmese leaders as well as opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and sought to support the 2011 Burmese democratic reforms. Clinton said that due to the direct and indirect communications she had had with Suu Kyi over the years, [...] "it was like seeing a friend you hadn't seen {{for a very long}} time even though it <b>was</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> meeting." [...] The outreach to Burma attracted both praise and criticism, with Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen saying it [...] "sends the wrong signal to the Burmese military thugs" [...] but others saying the visit combined idealism with respect to reform and realpolitik with respect to keeping Burma out of the direct Chinese sphere of influence. Clinton had had to overcome internal administration opposition from the White House and Pentagon, as well as from Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, to make the move, eventually making a personal appeal to Obama and gaining his approval. Regarding whether the Burmese regime would follow up on reform pledges, Clinton said, [...] "I can't predict what's going to happen, but I think it certainly is important for the United States to be on the side of democratic reform ... This is a first date, not a marriage, and we'll see where it leads." [...] She continued to address rights concerns in a December 2011 speech a few days later before the United Nations Human Rights Council, saying that the U.S. would advocate for gay rights abroad and that [...] "Gay rights are human rights" [...] and that [...] "It should never be a crime to be gay." [...] This itself drew criticism from some American social conservatives.|$|E
2500|$|On 7 December 2010, it was {{revealed}} that several other cast members had joined the project, including Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Sylvester McCoy as Radagast the Brown, Mikael Persbrandt as Beorn, William Kircher as Bifur, Ken Stott as Balin and Jed Brophy as Nori. Blanchett was the first returning cast member from The Lord of the Rings film trilogy to be cast in the films, even though her character does not appear in the novel. On her casting, Jackson said, [...] "Cate {{is one of my favorite}} actors to work with and I couldn't be more thrilled to have her reprise the role she so beautifully brought to life in the earlier films." [...] McCoy, the former Doctor Who star, who appeared alongside McKellen in a Royal Shakespeare Company's King Lear, was confirmed to be in negotiations to play a major role as a [...] "wizard" [...] in October 2010, leading to speculation he could appear as Radagast the Brown. During the production of The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, McCoy had been contacted about playing the role of Bilbo and was kept in place as a potential Bilbo for six months before Jackson went with Ian Holm. On the casting of Persbrandt, Jackson was quoted as saying, [...] "The role of Beorn is an iconic one and Mikael <b>was</b> <b>our</b> <b>first</b> choice for the part. Since seeing him read for the role we can't imagine anyone else playing this character." [...] On the casting of Stott, Jackson commented [...] "Fran and I have long been fans of Ken's work and are excited he will be joining us on this journey." [...] The casting of Brophy came after his collaboration with Jackson on several films, including Braindead, Heavenly Creatures, and all three Lord of the Rings films as various creatures.|$|E
