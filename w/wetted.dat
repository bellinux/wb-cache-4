5|$|Adobe {{walls were}} {{historically}} made by laying the bricks with mud mortar, which swells and shrinks {{at the same}} rate as the bricks when <b>wetted</b> or dried, heated or cooled. Modern adobe may be stabilized with cement and bonded with cement mortars, but cement mortars will cause unstabilized adobe bricks to deteriorate due to the different rates of thermal expansion and contraction.|$|E
5|$|Glass {{can also}} be welded to metals and ceramics, {{although}} with metals the process is usually more adhesion {{to the surface of}} the metal rather than a commingling of the two materials. However, certain glasses will typically bond only to certain metals. For example, lead glass bonds readily to copper or molybdenum, but not to aluminum. Tungsten electrodes are often used in lighting but will not bond to quartz glass, so the tungsten is often <b>wetted</b> with molten borosilicate glass, which bonds to both tungsten and quartz. However, care must be taken to ensure that all materials have similar coefficients of thermal expansion to prevent cracking both when the object cools and when it is heated again. Special alloys are often used for this purpose, ensuring that the coefficients of expansion match, and sometimes thin, metallic coatings may be applied to a metal to create a good bond with the glass.|$|E
5|$|In road {{snow and}} ice control, brine is often used as an anti-icer rather than a de-icer. A vehicle carries a tank of brine, which is sprayed on the road surface before or {{at the onset of}} the storm. This keeps {{snow and ice}} from {{adhering}} to the surface and makes mechanical removal by plows easier. Solid salt is also <b>wetted</b> with brine or other liquid deicer. This speeds de-icing action and helps keep it from bouncing off the pavement into the gutter or ditch. Brine acts faster than solid salt and does not require compression by passing traffic to become effective. The brine is also more environmentally friendly, as less salt is required to treat the same length of road.|$|E

5|$|On {{water-based}} pitches, shorter fibres and <b>wetted</b> turf reduce {{friction and}} increase {{the speed at which}} the game can be played. However, these pitches require watering before, during and after the game and maintenance costs are significant. Sand-dressed pitches cost more than sand-filled pitches but are preferable for hockey as there is an absence of sand close to the playing surface. However, a multi-purpose surface suitable for sports including association football and tennis is often required and hockey may not be the predominant sport. There are many different specifications and categorisations for artificial turf including shock absorption, surface rebound, friction, and strength outlined by the International Hockey Federation. Recently, longer-pile third-generation or 3G pitches have become popular, especially for football, but these do not usually meet the FIH's test criteria; they are often too inconsistent and slow.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} {{study the effects of}} land reclamation (drying, <b>wetting,</b> flushing, and leaching) on the change of soil chemical properties of acid sulphate soils from Kalimantan. Randomized Complete Design (RCD) by two factors treatments with two replications is used in this research. Factor I was soil reactiveness that is define as (a) low reactive= R 1; (b) moderate reactive =R 2; (c) strong reactive= R 3, and (d) very strong reactive= R 4 respectively. Factor II was drying, <b>wetting,</b> and diluting that is define as (1) drying continuously after <b>wetting</b> = W 1, (2) <b>wetting</b> continuously = W 2; (3) drying after weeting and diluting =W 3; and (4) <b>wetting</b> and diluting. The result of experiments show that continuous drying after <b>wetting</b> (W 1) and drying after <b>wetting</b> and diluting (W 3) or continuous weeting (W 2) gave soils pH lower than the weeting and diluting (W 4). Dried on the strong reactive soils (R 4) not decrease soil pH significantly. The continouos drying after <b>wetting</b> (W 1) can increase EC (electrical conductivity) higher than the continous <b>wetting</b> (W 2) and <b>wetting</b> that followed diluting (W 4) or drying after <b>wetting</b> and diluting (W 3). The continouos <b>wetting</b> (W 2) and the continouos drying after <b>wetting</b> (W 1) has given the total soluble acidity of 63, 30 dan 61, 71 cmolc kg- 1 respectively, higher than drying after <b>wetting</b> and diluting (W 3) and <b>wetting</b> thatfollowed diluting (W 4) that given total soluble acidity of 54, 03 and 51, 95 cmolc kg- 1 respectively. The effects of drying, <b>wetting,</b> flushing, and leaching on the total soluble acidity, Soluble Al and soluble H, especially on the strong reactive soils are very significant. All of the exchangeble bases (Ca, Mg, K, Na) on the continouos drying after <b>wetting</b> (W 1) are lower than the continous <b>wetting</b> (W 2) and <b>wetting</b> that followed diluting (W 4) or drying after <b>wetting</b> and diluting (W 3) respectively. The continouos drying after <b>wetting</b> (W 1), the continous <b>wetting</b> (W 2) and <b>wetting</b> that follow diluting (W 4) or drying after <b>wetting</b> and diluting (W 3) decrease exchangable Mg, especially on strong reactive soils (R 4), but contradictive to low reactive soils (R 1). The continouos drying after <b>wetting</b> (W 1) increase exchangable Na, especially on low reactive soils (R 1), but the <b>wetting</b> that followed diluting (W 3, W 4) decreases exchangable Na...|$|R
