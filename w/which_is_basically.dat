The Serbian population of Montenegro is opposed to the idea of a linguistic separation, just as they are opposed to the separation of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church from the jurisdiction of the Serbian Orthodox Church.

25|$|The {{entry of}} {{tryptophan}} {{to the brain}} is crucial in the proper synthesis of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain. One way to acutely cause depression or bulimia or anxiety in humans, {{in order to assess}} an individual's vulnerability to those disorders, is to supplement with a formula with all or most amino acids except tryptophan. The protein synthesis elicited by the amino acids leads circulating amino acids, including tryptophan, to be incorporated into proteins. Tryptophan thus lowers in the brain {{as a result of the}} protein synthesis enhancement (causing circulating tryptophan to lower more than other amino acids), and perhaps also competition of large neutral amino acids for transport across the blood–brain barrier through the large neutral amino acid transporter 1 (LNAA1). The consequence is acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) in the brain and a consecutive lowering of serotonin synthesis. ATD, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>basically</b> a diagnostic procedure, is not a treatment for GA1.|$|E
25|$|The Mexican Spanish word “paste” (pronounced PAH-steh) {{come from}} the Cornish word pasties, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>basically</b> a {{semi-circular}} turnover made with a pastry crust with sweet or savory fillings. Cornish miners brought the recipe with them as they made {{a good way to}} bring their midday meal with them to the mines. One feature of both pasties and pastes is that they have a thick braided edge. Originally, this was done to provide the miners a way to hold the turnover without getting the filled portion dirty, as {{there was no way to}} wash their hands before eating. The shape and pastry portion of the turnover have remained the same but today, the fillings are decidedly Mexican: mole verde, beans, mole rojo, chicken “tinga,” pineapple, rice pudding and one seasonal specialty is a lamb paste with poblano chili peppers. Pastes are a local delicacy strongly identified with both Pachuca and Real del Monte.|$|E
25|$|By {{separating}} Aleppo from Damascus, Gouraud {{wanted to}} capitalize on a traditional state of competition between the two cities {{and turn it into}} political division. The people in Aleppo were unhappy with the fact that Damascus was chosen as capital for the new nation of Syria. Gouraud sensed this sentiment and tried to manipulate it by making Aleppo the capital of a large and wealthier state with which it would have been hard for Damascus to compete. The State of Aleppo as drawn by France contained most of the fertile area of Syria: the fertile countryside of Aleppo in addition to the entire fertile basin of river Euphrates. The state also had access to sea via the autonomous Sanjak of Alexandretta. On the other hand, Damascus, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>basically</b> an oasis on the fringes of the Syrian Desert, had neither enough fertile land nor access to sea. Basically, Gouraud wanted to lure Aleppo by giving it control over most of the agricultural and mineral wealth of Syria so that it would never want to unite with Damascus again.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{his most}} {{significant}} engineering failure, {{as noted by}} division chief Yuri Demyanko, was his insistence that hydrogen was unsuitable {{for use as a}} rocket fuel. As a result, the Soviet space program was still discussing the use of hydrogen-fueled engines while the Americans were assembling the Saturn V launcher. Also, Glushko's design bureau consistently failed at building a rocket engine powered by LOX/Kerosene with a large combustion chamber to rival the American F1 used on the Saturn V; instead, his solution was the RD-270, a single large combustion-chamber engine powered by hypergolic fuels which had almost the same thrust and better specific impulse as compared to the US F-1 rocket engine in addition to using the very advanced full-flow staged combustion concept as opposed to the simple gas generator cycle used by the F-1 rocket engine. This was a primary reason for the failure of the N1, which was forced to rely on a multitude of smaller engines for propulsion because Sergei Korolev, its chief designer, insisted on using the LOX/Kerosene combination, which Glushko felt would take much more time and money to design. Glushko never did overcome the combustion instability problems of large rocket motors using kerosene propellants; his eventual solution for this is seen on the RD-170 <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>basically</b> four smaller combustion chamber/nozzle assemblies sharing common fuel delivery systems. This solution and engine gave the Soviets the large thrust propulsion needed to build the Energia superbooster, and is probably the finest technical example of Glushko's abilities when he was at his best. The fact that he never developed this solution until the firing of Vasily Mishin and his gaining ultimate control of the entire Soviet space program {{is a testament to the}} paralyzing intrigue and in-fighting that went on within the Soviet effort to reach the Moon.|$|E

500|$|Development officially {{began in}} 2009, when TNT {{announced}} that it had ordered to pilot an untitled alien invasion project. Falling Skies was created by Robert Rodat, who {{is best known for}} writing the Oscar-winning film Saving Private Ryan, which was directed by Steven Spielberg. Rodat wrote the pilot episode from an idea which was co-conceived by Spielberg. Originally, Falling Skies was called Concord, referencing the Battles of Lexington and Concord and Tom Mason's profession as a former History Professor. Spielberg then came up with the title Falling Skies. [...] "I felt that this was a very interesting postapocalyptic story with a 21st century [...] spirit of '76. I came up — out of the blue one day — with the name Falling Skies, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>basically</b> what happens to the planet after this invasion. What is unique about this particular series is that the story starts after a successful conquest of the world," [...] he stated. Spielberg was attracted to the project due to its themes of survival. [...] "I've always been interested in how we survive and how resourceful we are as Americans. How would the survivors feed the children? How do they resupply themselves militarily in order to defend and even take back what they have lost?" [...] he added. Like much of Spielberg's work, such as The Pacific and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Falling Skies running theme is family and brotherhood. He explained, [...] "It's a theme I harken back to a lot because it's something I believe in. It's something I have the closest experience with. [...] They say write what you know, and with seven children and three sisters... I tend to always come back to the family as a touchstone for audiences to get into these rather bizarre stories." ...|$|E
