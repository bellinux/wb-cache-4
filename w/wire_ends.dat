5|$|Other {{scientists}} {{working for}} Davros, now {{aware of his}} plans, free the Doctor and give him enough time to rig the Dalek incubation room with explosives which would end {{the threat of the}} Daleks. As he is about to touch the two exposed <b>wire</b> <b>ends</b> to set them off, the Doctor questions if he has the right to make that decision and forgoes setting the explosions off. Just then, he learns that Davros has agreed to stop and allow the Kaled leaders to vote on the continuation of the project. As the leaders gather for this vote, the Doctor is able to recover the Time Ring and destroy the recordings he made, while learning that the Thals and Mutos have prepared the means to destroy the bunker. As the vote is called, Davros reveals this was all a decoy, giving the Daleks he sent to the Thal time to return to the bunker and exterminate the remaining Kaleds. Harry and Sarah escape the chaos, while the Doctor returns to set off the incubator room's explosives, but a Dalek inadvertently completes the circuit and sets it off itself. The Doctor escapes in time before the Thal and Mutos' bomb caves in the bunker, trapping Davros and the Daleks. Inside, Davros realises the Daleks have gained a will of their own, and attempts to stop the production line, but a Dalek incapacitates him.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a device {{for the production}} of flexible electrical stranded wires cut to length and prefabricated for assembly, whereby the stranded wires are wrapped by a common insulation sheath. The stranded wires are stripped at the stranded <b>wire</b> <b>end</b> by a stripping unit, twisted and then welded rigidly together by an ultrasound welding unit. The ultrasound welding unit and the stripping unit are combined in one unit. The stripping unit is assigned a sensor and the entire device is coordinated by an electric control. Welding of the stranded <b>wire</b> <b>end</b> is performed without the supply of additional materials such as solder and without the use of separately produced parts such as <b>wire</b> <b>end</b> sleeves or other terminal parts...|$|R

50|$|Jump wires (also called jumper wires) for {{solderless}} breadboarding can {{be obtained}} in ready-to-use jump wire sets or can be manually manufactured. The latter can become tedious work for larger circuits. Ready-to-use jump wires come in different qualities, some even with tiny plugs attached to the <b>wire</b> <b>ends.</b> Jump wire material for ready-made or homemade wires should usually be 22 AWG (0.33 mm2) solid copper, tin-plated wire - assuming no tiny plugs are to {{be attached to the}} <b>wire</b> <b>ends.</b> The <b>wire</b> <b>ends</b> should be stripped 3/16 to 5/16 in. Shorter stripped wires might result in bad contact with the board's spring clips (insulation being caught in the springs). Longer stripped wires increase the likelihood of short-circuits on the board. Needle-nose pliers and tweezers are helpful when inserting or removing wires, particularly on crowded boards.|$|E
50|$|To {{incorporate}} nanowire {{technology into}} industrial applications, researchers in 2008 developed {{a method of}} welding nanowires together: a sacrificial metal nanowire is placed adjacent {{to the ends of}} the pieces to be joined (using the manipulators of a scanning electron microscope); then an electric current is applied, which fuses the <b>wire</b> <b>ends.</b> The technique fuses wires as small as 10 nm.|$|E

50|$|With the {{addition}} of electronic amplification developed by Curt Stille in the 1920s, the telegraphone evolved into wire recorders which were popular for voice recording and dictation during the 1940s and into the 1950s. The reproduction quality of wire recorders was significantly lower than that achievable with phonograph disk recording technology. There were also practical difficulties, such as the tendency of the wire to become tangled or snarled. Splicing could be performed by knotting together the cut <b>wire</b> <b>ends,</b> but the results were not very satisfactory.|$|E
5000|$|Terminal strip construction, {{which is}} often {{referred}} to as point-to-point construction within the tube guitar amplifier community, uses terminal strips (also called [...] "tag boards"). A terminal strip has stamped tin-plated copper terminals, each with a hole through which <b>wire</b> <b>ends</b> could be pushed, fitted on an insulating strip, usually made of a cheap, heat-resistant material such as synthetic-resin bonded paper (FR-2), or bakelite reinforced with cotton. The insulator has an integral mounting bracket, sometimes electrically connected to one or more of the stamped loops to ground them to the chassis.|$|E

50|$|ZIF wire-to-board {{connectors}} {{are used}} for attaching wires to printed circuit boards inside electronic equipment. An example would be the cable between the LCD screen and motherboard in laptops. The wires, often formed into a ribbon cable, are pre-stripped and the bare ends placed inside the connector. The two sliding parts of the connector are then pushed together, causing it to grip the wires. The most important advantage of this system {{is that it does}} not require a mating half to be fitted to the <b>wire</b> <b>ends,</b> therefore saving space and cost inside miniaturised equipment.

5000|$|... ===Radioisotope {{thermoelectric}} generator=== A radioisotope {{thermoelectric generator}} uses thermocouples. Each thermocouple is formed from two wires of different metals (or other materials). A temperature gradient {{along the length}} of each wire produces a voltage gradient {{from one end of the}} wire to the other; but the different materials produce different voltages per degree of temperature difference. By connecting the wires at one end, heating that end but cooling the other end, a usable, but small (millivolts), voltage is generated between the unconnected <b>wire</b> <b>ends.</b> In practice, many are connected in series to generate a larger voltage from the same heat source, as heat flows from the hot ends to the cold ends. Metal thermocouples have low thermal-to-electrical efficiency. However, the carrier density and charge can be adjusted in semiconductor materials such as bismuth telluride and silicon germanium to achieve much higher conversion efficiencies.|$|E

By controlling the polarization {{of the incident}} laser light, the wire plasmons can be routed into different wire branches and result in light emission from the corresponding <b>wire</b> <b>ends.</b> This routing behavior {{is found to be}} strongly dependent on the wavelength of light. Thus for certain incident polarizations, light of different wavelength will be routed into different branches.

40|$|Frequency {{response}} measurements by {{the current}} injection technique of hot-wire anemometers at very low overheat ratios, show that for wires with substantial end conduction losses, a single time constant system response is not obtained. This is contrary to currently used theoretical models. A new model is presented which successfully simulates the measured frequency response characteristics. It is concluded that the traditional assumption of constancy of temperature at the <b>wire</b> <b>ends</b> under dynamic conditions is incorrect. Hot-wires with negligible end conduction losses were found to give the anticipated single time constant system response...|$|E
