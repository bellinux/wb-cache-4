5|$|When Sir Walter Scott visited Dunvegan Castle in 1814, {{he learned}} of several {{traditional}} tales relating to the area and the clan.

The second was that when it was spread upon a nuptial bed, it ensured fertility. The third <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> brought herring into the loch.|$|E
5000|$|Psunj {{was called}} [...] "Pisunus" [...] in antiquity. There are several {{suggested}} etymologies for <b>that.</b> One <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{comes from the}} Indo-European root *pekj (cattle). The other <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> comes from the Indo-European roots *peiH (big, in the sense [...] "mountain") and *sen (old). One very similar to <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> comes from *peiH and *sewn (black). The other <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> related to the Latin word [...] "pinus", meaning [...] "pine tree" [...] or [...] "resin", itself without a widely accepted etymology.|$|R

5|$|Describing {{the choice}} of {{developing}} a game based on the existing White Wolf property over creating their own, Boyarsky said that although an original property lacked the constraints of an existing one, the downside <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had not been tested and could be rejected by its potential audience; an existing property was proven. Troika tried to stay {{as close as possible}} to the White Wolf rules, while reducing the number of abilities and disciplines to those relevant to Bloodlines gameplay.|$|E

2500|$|Socrates', Plato's and Aristotle's {{ideas about}} truth are {{seen by some}} as {{consistent}} with correspondence theory. In his Metaphysics, Aristotle stated: [...] "To say of what <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not, or of what <b>is</b> not <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> is false, while to say of what <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> and of what <b>is</b> not <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not, is true".

5|$|King was {{sponsored}} by the Daily Express and Sunday Express newspapers. One of the shortcomings of the boat <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had neither guard rails or shrouds to hold on to.

50|$|The most {{defining}} {{aspect of}} the B5000 <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a stack machine as treated above. However, two other very important features of the architecture <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> tag-based and descriptor-based.|$|R
5000|$|In Hungarian {{the town}} is known as Valpó and in German as Walpach. In antiquity, it was called Iovalum. [...] There are several {{suggested}} etymologies. One <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> comes from the Latin root *Iov-, meaning [...] "divine". However, the ending can't be explained by Latin. One explanation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> comes from the Indo-European words *yow and *h2elut, so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> means [...] "magical beer." [...] The other, more likely, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> comes from the Indo-European roots *yow and *h2elom, so <b>that</b> <b>it</b> means [...] "magical herb", whatever plant that signified. Perhaps the simplest explanation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> comes from the Indo-European word *wel, meaning [...] "valley", whatever [...] "Io-" [...] meant.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} etymologies {{suggested}} {{for the name}} [...] "Odra". One <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> comes from the Croatian word [...] "oderati" [...] (to cut through). The other <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> comes from the Indo-European root *wodr (water).|$|R
5|$|Nearly {{a decade}} after the Tagora had ceased production, the view of the car in the {{automotive}} press <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was merely average though there was little actively wrong with the car. The view was that the Tagora had the advantage of refinement, good manners and, in V6 form, good performance. Rust was identified as the single biggest problem for the surviving cars, usually around the rear suspension mountings. Buckley suggested that the car might attain collectible status by 2003.|$|E
5|$|One {{interpretation}} on how megalodon appeared <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a robust-looking shark, and {{may have}} had a similar build to the great white shark. The jaws may have been blunter and wider than the great white, and the fins would have also been similar in shape, though thicker due to its size.

5|$|One of {{the design}} intents of the SS190 variety of this {{cartridge}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{have the ability to}} penetrate Kevlar protective vests—such as the NATO CRISAT vest—that will stop conventional pistol bullets. Fired from the P90, the SS190 is capable of penetrating the CRISAT vest at a range of 200m (219yd), or a Level IIIA Kevlar vest at the same range. However, sporting variants of the 5.7×28mm are classified by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) as not armor-piercing.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} {{accounts of the}} origin on this apple cultivar. One theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> originated from Bismarck in Tasmania (now Collinsvale), which was a German settlement. Another theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> raised by F. Fricke, a German settler at Carisbrooke, Victoria, Australia. A third <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> originated in Canterbury, New Zealand. The fruit was grown in Victoria and also in England and across Europe until the 1930s.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{alternative}} {{sources for the}} origins of the name. One <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> comes from the name of a schooner <b>that</b> <b>was</b> wrecked here. The other <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> describes the state of the shore during a storm.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding {{the law of}} {{excluded}} middle, Aristotle wrote: But on {{the other}} hand there cannot be an intermediate between contradictories, but of one subject we must either affirm or deny any one predicate. This is clear, in the first place, if we define what the true and the false are. To say of what <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not, or of what <b>is</b> not <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> is false, while to say of what <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> and of what <b>is</b> not <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not, <b>is</b> true; so <b>that</b> he who says of anything <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> or <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not, will say either what is true or what is false Aristotle ...|$|R

5|$|Prime Minister Winston Churchill {{suggested}} {{reviving the}} Order in 1943 to recognise {{the services of}} General The Hon.

5|$|The Court of Claims {{looked at}} whether the tribe had {{hunting and fishing}} rights and drew the same {{conclusion}} as the Wisconsin Supreme Court—that {{the terms of the}} treaty had to be resolved in the favor of the tribe, citing The Menominee Tribe of Indians v. United States, 95 Ct.Cl. 232 (Ct.Cl., 1941). In that decision, the Court of Claims had observed that the reason the tribe had agreed {{to the site of the}} reservation <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was well suited for hunting, with plenty of game. The hunting rights by treaty were therefore confirmed.|$|E
30|$|In a nutshell, the {{advantage}} of OPE <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> destroys {{the structure of the}} tree and {{the advantage}} of PPE <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> destroys the order information. Thus, by combining OPE with PPE, we remove both order- and structure-based linkages.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{suggested}} etymologies {{for the name}} [...] "Karašica". It's not explainable in Croatian.

Second <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> comes from the Latin word [...] "Carassius", denoting several species of freshwater fish. Perhaps the most likely one <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> comes from the Indo-European root *(s)ker, meaning [...] "to cut", in the sense [...] "the river that cuts through the valley".|$|R
5|$|The episode {{features}} the first {{appearance of the}} bowling alley Barney's Bowlarama. The original backstory for Barney's Bowlarama <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was owned by Barney Gumble. Over time it changed to Barney just being an employee, as the writers could not imagine Barney owning anything. It was later revealed that Barney's uncle was the owner. The exterior of the Bowlarama was designed by No Doubt member Eric Stefani. The episode also marks the first appearances of Lenny Leonard and Helen Lovejoy.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} the first to be {{released}} under the Octane Games brand. It received average reviews from critics upon release, with IGN's Gord Goble writing that his main issue with the game <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was very short and lacked any lasting appeal. Shortly after the game's release, an update was made available that added support for dual-monitors, support for editable key configurations, and more destructible objects to the game.|$|E
