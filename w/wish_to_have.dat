5|$|Although the 2012 Olympic men's {{basketball}} tournament was then {{more than a}} year away, qualifying tournaments in all five of FIBA's continental zones were to be held in the Northern Hemisphere summer of 2011 (the traditional basketball offseason throughout the world). The lockout resulted in the suspension of an agreement between the NBA and FIBA by which the NBA would take on most of the costs for insuring the value of its players' contracts in the event they were injured during international competition. As a result, national federations that <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> NBA players on their squads must now provide full coverage instead of supplemental insurance.|$|E
5|$|John and Josephine deeply <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a {{child and}} when she is born with skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony, they name her Snow White. However, Josephine, Snow White's mother, dies in childbirth, leaving John alone with their child. In the winter, John struggles to find food for his daughter, Snow White, when he sheds a tear over a frozen lake and frees a {{creature}} known as the Green-Eyed One. As thanks for freeing him, Green-Eyed One offers John three wishes. For John's wishes, he asks for nourishment for his daughter, a kingdom to raise his family, and a queen for a new wife, as the creature cannot raise the dead.|$|E
5|$|According to Microsoft sources, BitLocker {{does not}} contain an {{intentionally}} built-in backdoor; without a backdoor {{there is no way}} for law enforcement to have a guaranteed passage to the data on the user's drives that is provided by Microsoft. In 2006 the UK Home Office expressed concern over the lack of a backdoor and tried entering into talks with Microsoft to get one introduced, although Microsoft developer Niels Ferguson and other Microsoft spokesmen state that they will not grant the <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> one added. Microsoft engineers have said that FBI agents also put pressure on them in numerous meetings in order to add a backdoor, although no formal, written request was ever made; Microsoft engineers eventually suggested to the FBI that agents should look for the hard-copy of the key that the BitLocker program suggests its users to make. Although the AES encryption algorithm used in BitLocker is in the public domain, its implementation in BitLocker, as well as other components of the software, are proprietary; however, the code is available for scrutiny by Microsoft partners and enterprises, subject to a non-disclosure agreement.|$|E

Removal may occur with freezing, opening up the lesion and scraping the inside, or laser therapy. Scraping the lesion can however result in scarring.

25|$|A Devon legend {{tells of}} a funeral {{procession}} heading across Dartmoor {{on its way to}} Widecombe and the burial ground, carrying a particularly unpopular and evil old man.

Local departments may inform the media prior to an arrest even occurring, if they <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> footage of that being broadcast. Federal agencies, on the other hand, are generally prohibited from informing the media of arrests in advance by Justice Department policy. However, they cannot prohibit photography or video of a defendant being transported through public places after the arrest has been publicized.|$|E
25|$|Stereo linking can be {{achieved}} in two ways: Either the compressor sums to mono {{the left and right}} channel at the input, then only the left channel controls are functional; or, the compressor still calculates the required amount of gain reduction independently for each channel and then applies the highest amount of gain reduction to both (in such case it could still make sense to dial different settings on left and right channels as one might <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> less compression for left-side events).|$|E
25|$|In {{contemporary}} religious circles these rabbinic leniencies {{have received}} wide but not universal acceptance. In Israel, the Chief Rabbinate obtains permission from all farmers who <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> their land sold. The land is then legally {{sold to a}} non-Jew for a large sum of money. The payment is made by a cheque post-dated to {{after the end of}} the Sabbatical year. When the cheque is returned or not honoured at the end of the year the land reverts to its original owners. Thus, the fields can be farmed with certain restrictions.|$|E

25|$|With war still looming on 24 February 2003, Saddam Hussein {{took part}} in an {{interview}} with CBS News reporter Dan Rather. Talking for more than three hours, he denied possessing any weapons of mass destruction, or any other weapons prohibited by UN guidelines. He also expressed a <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a live televised debate with George W. Bush, which was declined. It was his first interview with a U.S. reporter in over a decade. CBS aired the taped interview later that week. Saddam Hussein later told an FBI interviewer that he once left open the possibility that Iraq possessed {{weapons of mass destruction in}} order to appear strong against Iran.|$|E
25|$|The typical protagonist in {{the works}} of Pavese is a loner, through choice or through circumstances. His {{relationships}} with men and women tend to be temporary and superficial. He may <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> more solidarity with other people, but he often ends up betraying his ideals and friends; for example in The Prison, the political exile in a village in Southern Italy receives a note from another political confinato living nearby, who suggests a meeting. The protagonist rejects a show of solidarity and refuses to meet him. The title of the collection of the two novellas is Before the Cock Crows, a reference to Peter's betrayal of Christ before his death.|$|E

Beside the cricket ground is the large sports hall complex of the Sport Wales National Centre. Cardiff Corinthians F.C. have previously used the area for football.

25|$|Nevertheless, Bishop Hepburn {{did play}} an {{important}} part in Scottish politics of the 1540s and 1550s. Though {{he was part of the}} privy council of the Governor of Scotland, James Hamilton, Earl of Arran (after 1548, Duke of Châtellerault), he nevertheless opposed Arran's <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the young Mary, Queen of Scots, put in English custody. In this he was supporting the staunchly anti-Protestant Cardinal David Beaton. The Bishop of Moray was in attendance at the provincial council of the Scottish church in 1549, an attempt to reform the church internally without abandoning links with Rome. He was present at the burnings of Protestant heretics/martyrs in 1550 and 1558.|$|E
25|$|When {{analyzing}} {{an inverse}} problem, obtaining a maximum likelihood model {{is usually not}} sufficient, as we normally also <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> information on the resolution power of the data. In the general case {{we may have a}} large number of model parameters, and an inspection of the marginal probability densities of interest may be impractical, or even useless. But it is possible to pseudorandomly generate a large collection of models according to the posterior probability distribution and to analyze and display the models {{in such a way that}} information on the relative likelihoods of model properties is conveyed to the spectator. This can be accomplished by means of an efficient Monte Carlo method, even in cases where no explicit formula for the a priori distribution is available.|$|E

25|$|Kemalism has {{to balance}} the space between {{different}} religious sects. Religious education, which was originally left to private initiative with after-school courses until 1980, when it was brought to secondary education with a formal curriculum covering religious doctrines. This change of politics to balance religious doctrine is debated. There are three main ideological perspectives in this debate. The first one views this change as a breach of Kemalist secularist ideology, and demands {{a return to the}} previous policy. The second perspective accepts the religious education but objects to its compulsory position. The third position accepts the compulsory position except those responsible for minority communities, who <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> their own religious courses, within the boundaries of the regulations administered by the Ministry of Education.|$|E
25|$|Modern alternatives, {{such as the}} telegraph, telephone, telex, facsimile, and email, {{have reduced}} the {{attractiveness}} of paper mail for many applications. These modern alternatives have some advantages: {{in addition to their}} speed, they may be more secure, e.g., because the general public can not learn the address of the sender or recipient from the envelope, and occasionally traditional items of mail may fail to arrive, e.g. due to vandalism to mailboxes, unfriendly pets, and adverse weather conditions. Mail carriers due to perceived hazards or inconveniences, may refuse, officially or otherwise, to deliver mail to a particular address (for instance, if there is no clear path to the door or mailbox). On the other hand, traditional mail avoids the possibility of computer malfunctions and malware, and the recipient does not need to print it out if they <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a paper copy, though scanning is required to make a digital copy.|$|E
25|$|From 1937 to 1998, the Irish {{constitution}} {{included a}} claim on Northern Ireland {{as a part}} of the national territory. However, the state also opposed and used its security forces against those armed groups – principally the Provisional Irish Republican Army – who tried to unite Ireland by force. This occurred in the 1950s, throughout the 1970s and 1980s and has continued on a reduced scale. Irish governments meanwhile tried to broker an agreement to the conflict known as The Troubles within Northern Ireland from 1968 to the late 1990s. The British government officially recognised the right of the Irish government to be a party to the Northern negotiations in the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985. In 1998, as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Irish constitution was altered by referendum to remove the territorial claim to Northern Ireland and instead extend the right of Irish citizenship to all the people of the island should they <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> it.|$|E
