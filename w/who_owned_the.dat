5|$|A Momentary Lapse of Reason was {{recorded}} primarily on Gilmour's converted houseboat, Astoria.

Unlike many of Pink Floyd's studio albums, A Momentary Lapse of Reason has no central theme and is instead a collection of songs written by Gilmour, sometimes with outside songwriters.|$|E

5|$|After the war, de Peyster served {{overseas}} as a dignitary. When {{he returned}} to the United States, he ran for office and was elected to the State Assembly. His father disagreed with many of his political positions, and they eventually stopped speaking to each other. In 1900, the family feud culminated in a race for the office of Mayor of their native town, father running against son. After defeating his father, <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>the</b> town hall, he was forced to move the Mayor's office to a new building. He died in 1903, survived by his three daughters.|$|E

Development work began in late 2004, while a similarly film-to-Broadway-to-film project, Mel Brooks' The Producers, was in production.|$|E
5|$|However, Boston's {{chances of}} getting Russell seemed slim. Because the Celtics had {{finished}} second in the previous season and the worst teams had the highest draft picks, the Celtics had slipped too low in the draft order to pick Russell. In addition, Auerbach had already used his territorial pick to acquire talented forward Tom Heinsohn. But Auerbach knew that the Rochester Royals, <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>the</b> first draft pick, already had a skilled rebounder in Maurice Stokes, were looking for an outside shooting guard and were unwilling to pay Russell the $25,000 signing bonus he requested. The St. Louis Hawks, <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>the</b> second pick, drafted Russell, but were vying for Celtics center Ed Macauley, a six-time All-Star who had roots in St. Louis. Auerbach agreed to trade Macauley, who had previously asked to be traded to St. Louis in order to be with his sick son, if the Hawks gave up Russell. The owner of St Louis called Auerbach later and demanded more in the trade. Not only did he want Macauley, who was the Celtics premier player at the time, he wanted Cliff Hagan, who had been serving in the military for three years and had not yet played for the Celtics. After much debate, Auerbach agreed to give up Hagan, and the Hawks made the trade.|$|E

5|$|In {{the eastern}} {{corner of the}} south aisle {{of the church is}} a {{monument}} of the Baber family, who formerly had large possessions in the parish. Inserted in a window of the aisle, is a wooden effigy, supposed to be of Sir John de Hautville, a Knight of Henry III's, <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>the</b> northeastern estate named Norton Hautville, now Norton Hawkfield: in the same directional corner of the church are monuments to the Strach(e)y family who lived at Sutton Court.|$|E
5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, {{agriculture}} {{was the biggest}} industry in Ireland. In 1876, {{the government of the}} United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland commissioned a survey to find <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>the</b> land in Ireland. The survey found that almost all land was the property of just 10,000 people, or 0.2% of the population. The majority were small landlords, but the 750 richest landlords owned half of the country between them. Many of the richest were absentee landlords who lived in Britain or elsewhere in Ireland, and paid agents like Charles Boycott to manage their estates.|$|E
5|$|Life in the Middle Ages {{centred on}} the {{families}} <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>the</b> manor {{in what was}} then an isolated rural community. Agriculture, hand loom weaving, quarrying and mining occupied the few inhabitants until the middle of the 19th century. A chapel built before 1541 was replaced by the present church in 1666 and by 1703 Nonconformism led to the building of a Presbyterian church, now a Unitarian Chapel. A grammar school was founded by charter of Queen Elizabeth I in 1556.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool Football Club {{was formed}} on 15 March 1892 {{following}} a disagreement between {{the directors of}} Everton Football Club and its president, John Houlding, <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>the</b> club's ground, Anfield. A dispute over rent resulted in Everton moving to Goodison Park, which left Houlding with an empty stadium. Thus, he founded Liverpool F.C., and they joined the Lancashire League. After winning the league title in their first season, Liverpool were accepted into the Football League for the 1893–94 season, following the resignations of Accrington and Bootle.|$|E
5|$|Losh, Wilson & Bell's first {{ironworks}} {{was founded}} in 1809 at Walker, beside the alkali works, carrying out a mixture of engineering work but not building steam engines. By 1818, George Stephenson's original wooden wagonway was completely relaid with cast-iron edge-rails made in collaboration between Stephenson, <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>the</b> patent, and Losh, Wilson and Bell. Around 1821, George Stephenson was briefly {{a partner in the}} Walker Ironworks.|$|E
5|$|Swakeleys manor, {{subordinate}} to Ickenham, {{was named after}} Robert Swalcliffe, <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>the</b> manor with his wife Joan in the 14th century. He appears in records as Robert de Swalclyve and Robert de Wykeham, reflecting his ownership of Swakeleys and Wickham Park in Oxfordshire. In 1347, he owed £40 to a money lender, Roger Rikeman, which {{he was unable to}} pay, and so his land in Ickenham was passed by Rikeman in 1350 to John de Charlton.|$|E

5|$|The Daily Mail took on Beach Thomas as {{a writer}} of {{material}} relating to the countryside. Lord Northcliffe, <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>the</b> newspaper, recognised that Beach Thomas would need {{to live in a}} rural environment if he was to perform his duties well. This understanding delighted Beach Thomas because it meant he could limit his visits to London. He moved to the Mimram Valley in Hertfordshire, and thereafter held Northcliffe in high regard.|$|E
5|$|The area {{surrounding}} Tuskulėnai Manor {{was referred}} to as Tuskulėnai (Russian: Tuskuljany; Polish: Tuskulanum) until World War II. This area was also known as Losiovka or Losiuvka, colloquially named after A. Losev, colonel of Special Corps of Gendarmes and later general of the Russian Empire, <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>the</b> folwark of Tuskulėnai in 1869. The placenames are associated primarily with individual wooden houses, built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, some of which are still scattered among the apartment buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{town centre}} was {{extensively}} remodelled in the 1970s, a scheme {{financed by the}} Showering family <b>who</b> <b>owned</b> <b>the</b> town's cider manufactories. The scheme included a new library (in a faithful copy of a former inn, The Bunch of Grapes, which had been demolished), and a new entertainment complex called The Centre, entirely in concrete, {{on the eastern side}} of the market square. When the allegedly Roman Chi Rho amulet was found in the Fosse Lane excavations in the 1990s, the complex was renamed The Amulet in honour of the find. It has recently been renamed again as The Academy.|$|E
