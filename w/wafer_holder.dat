40|$|Growth of GaInAsP device {{structures}} by MOMBE {{had to be}} optimized, {{especially for}} selective area epitaxy to realize monolithic device integration. In addition the potential of MOMBE for device production had to be explored. Laser structures with strained multiple quantum well layers (MQWs) had to be fabricated and compared to MOVPE structures in terms of device performance. Laser-waveguide integration and planar-selective laser structures had to be formed by selective area epitaxy. A <b>wafer</b> <b>holder</b> for homogeneous growth in single and multi wafer (3 x 2 '') operation had to be developed. A variety of MQW laser structures were fabricated with GaInAsP and InAsP layers as well material, where a compressive strain up to 2 % was achieved. The MOMBE laser results are comparable to best MOVPE data. High quality waveguide-laser couplings were accomplished by embedded selective area epitaxy of the waveguide structure. Furthermore selective growth of laser structures was investigated. The threshold current densities of these lasers are comparable to data from large area reference lasers. A novel indium free <b>wafer</b> <b>holder</b> was realized resulting in excellent layer homogeneity. For GaInAsP NQW structures {{a standard deviation of}} photoluminescence #DELTA##lambda#< 2 nm was obtained across more than 90 % of the wafer area in multi-wafer operation for each wafer, the wafer-to-wafer standard deviation was #DELTA##lambda#< 4 nm. Hence a basis for industrial use of MOMBE has been established. The investigations were performed in close cooperation with the University of Ulm, a project partner. An internationally leading position has been reached by this project. An extension of these studies to laser-modulator integration is planned for the future. (orig.)

40|$|International audienceThis work {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} {{to the development of}} MOEMS devices by robotic microassembly of individual micro-optical components onto reconfigurable free-space micro-optical table (RFS-MOT). Various micro-optical elements (e. g. microlenses, micromirrors) are integrated within a generic structure of silicon holders. The holders are manipulated by 3 D micro-assembly station with active microgripper, then aligned with nanometer precision within the guiding rails of silicon baseplate, and finally fixed by release of integrated mechanical snap connector. The fabrication of RFS-MOT components involves bulk micromachining of standard silicon wafer (baseplate) or SOI <b>wafer</b> (<b>holders).</b> The design and technology of RFS-MOT is presented. The successful micro-assembly of holders is demonstrated as an experimental validation of the proposed approach.

40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of residual strain in undoped 2 inch GaAs wafers multi-step annealed in holders of different geometry was characterized by the scanning infrared polariscope (SIRP) method. The SIRP maps reveal that the distribution of strain is significantly influenced by the symmetry of annealing, in particular by the points of contact between <b>wafer</b> and <b>holder.</b> In contrast to the as-grown state, the annealed wafers show fine patterns of slip lines. The lowest level and the most homogeneous distribution of residual strain were achieved by annealing in a vertically positioned holder of graphite rings. The radial temperature differences in the wafers caused by heating and cooling were checked by means of thermocouples on dummies of graphite. Temperature gradients up to 30 K cm - 1 were measured depending upon the rates of cooling and heating...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{present a}} method to pattern etch masks for {{arbitrary}} nano- and microstructures on different, inclined planes of a sample. Our method allows standard CMOS fabrication techniques {{to be used in}} different inclined planes; thus yielding three-dimensional structures with a network topology. The method involves processing of the sample in a first plane, followed by mounting the prepared sample in a specially designed silicon <b>holder</b> <b>wafer</b> such that the second, inclined plane is exposed to continued processing. As a proof of principle we demonstrate the fabrication of a patterned chromium etch mask for three-dimensional photonic crystals in silicon. The etch mask is made on the 90 ° inclined plane of a silicon sample that already contains high aspect ratio nanopores. The etch mask is carefully aligned with respect to these pores, with a high translational accuracy o...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Automatically scanned IV and CV {{measurements}} were performed for mapping characterization on the substrate and epitaxy layer 4 H-SiC. Mapping results of n-value, SBH and breakdown voltage on the substrate were observed to match well with X-ray topographic image, where {{the presence of}} defects on its surface strongly modified the IV characteristic as well as breakdown voltage. The defects on the substrate were also found to crucially determine the breakdown voltage of grown epitaxy layer. Carrier density in the substrate was observed to be highly concentrated in the wafer-center, while it was distributed along a forward direction in the epitaxy layer. Gas flow direction was assumed as {{a major reason for}} non-uniformity. The rotation of <b>wafer</b> <b>holder</b> during epitaxy growth might be needed for achieving uniformity of net-doping concentration...|$|E
40|$|Resonance Ultrasonic Vibration (RUV) {{metrology}} {{offers a}} sensitive non-destructive real-time solution to silicon wafer crack detection. The stresses {{generated in the}} wafers by the handling device used in the RUV method may have a significant influence {{on the effectiveness of}} this method, particularly for thinner wafers. The handling stresses produced by different designs of the vacuum wafer holders and their effects on the resonance properties of the ultrasonically excited wafer are studied using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and confirmed by RUV tests. FEA results and RUV experiments show that optimization of the wafer handling stress obtained by redesigning the <b>wafer</b> <b>holder</b> does not alter the resonance frequencies and mode shapes of the wafer significantly compared to the free vibration case. Therefore, it is possible to use RUV approach for crack detection in thin silicon wafers without significant modification...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop an electroplating process so further studies in copper processing can be undertaken at R. LT. Electroplating was performed using the facilities available at the University of Rochester. This system utilizes a copper sulfate based electrolyte and an 8 ” <b>wafer</b> <b>holder.</b> In order to use the electroplating tool for four-inch wafers, a fixture was designed. Plating was performed on Si wafers coated with adhesion and seed layer of copper at varying current densities. Plated films were characterized for sheet resistance. A 7 % standard deviation in sheet resistance of the electroplated layer has been achieved with this wafer fixture design. This variation can be explained in terms of the electric field distribution in the electrolytic cell. The bulk resistivity for the plated copper was found to be 2. 06 E- 6 ≤ 2 •cm.

The deposition reactor is a 2. 45 GHz microwave cavity applicator with the plasma confined inside a 12 cm diameter fused silica bell jar. The deposition substrates utilized are up to 75 mm diameter silicon <b>wafers.</b> The substrate <b>holder</b> is actively cooled with a water-cooled substrate holder to achieve a substrate surface temperature of 600 - 1150 C. The pressure utilized is 60 - 180 Torr and the microwave incident power is 2 - 4. 5 kW. Important parameters for the deposition of thick films with uniform quality and thickness include substrate temperature uniformity as well as plasma discharge size and shape. As deposited thickness uniformities of ± 5 % across 75 mm diameters are achieved with simultaneous growth rates of 1. 9 m/h.

The chamber itself {{is equipped with a}} liquid nitrogen cryoshield and a rotatable crystal holder capable of carrying more than one <b>wafer.</b> The crystal <b>holder</b> is usually heated from the backside to temperatures of 500 to 700°C. Most setups also have RHEED equipment for the in-situ monitoring of surface superstructures on the growing surface and for measuring growth rates, and mass spectrometers for the analysis of the molecular species in the beams and the analysis of the residual gases.The gas inlet system, {{which is one of the}} most important components of the system, controls the material beam flux. Pressure controlled systems are used most commonly. The material flux is controlled by the input pressure of the gas injection capillary. The pressure inside the chamber can be measured and controlled by a capacitance manometer. The molecular beams of gaseous source materials injectors or effusion jets that ensure a homogeneous beam profile. For some starting compounds, such as the hydrides that are the group V starting material, the hydrides have to be precracked into the injector. This is usually done by thermally decomposing with a heated metal or filament.|$|R
40|$|We have {{completed}} the circuit design and packaging procedure for an NIH-funded neural implant, called a MOTE (Microscale Optoelectronically Transduced Electrode). Neural recording implants for mice have greatly advanced neuroscience, but they are often damaging and limited in their recording location. This project will result in free-floating implants that cause less damage, provide rapid electronic recording, and increase range of recording across the cortex. A low-power silicon IC containing amplification and digitization sub-circuits {{is powered by a}} dual-function gallium arsenide photovoltaic and LED. Through thin film deposition, photolithography, and chemical and physical etching, the Molnar Group and the McEuen Group (Applied and Engineering Physics department) will package the IC and LED into a biocompatible implant approximately 100 µm 3. The IC and LED are complete and we have begun refining this packaging procedure in the Cornell NanoScale Science & Technology Facility. 	ICs with 3 D time-resolved imaging capabilities can image microorganisms and other biological samples given proper packaging. A portable, flat, easily manufactured package would enable scientists to place biological samples on slides directly above the Molnar group’s imaging chip. We have developed a packaging procedure using laser cutting, photolithography, epoxies, and metal deposition. Using a flip-chip method, we verified the process by aligning and adhering a sample chip to a <b>holder</b> <b>wafer.</b> 	In the CNF, we have worked on a long-term metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor characterization project. Former Fellow and continuing CNF user Kwame Amponsah developed the original procedure for the capacitor fabrication, and another former fellow, Jonilyn Longenecker, revised the procedure and began the arduous process of characterization. MIM caps are useful to clean room users as testing devices to verify electronic characteristics of their active circuitry. This project’s objective is to determine differences in current-voltage (IV) and capacitor-voltage (CV) relationships across variations in capacitor size and dielectric type. This effort requires an approximately 20 -step process repeated for two-to-six varieties (dependent on temperature and thermal versus plasma options) of the following dielectrics: HfO 2, SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, TaOx, and TiO 2...|$|R
40|$|Wave front sensing is {{an optical}} method {{allowing}} non-contacting topography measurements of flat surfaces. Applications {{of the method}} are, for instance, the characterization of optical components, semiconductor surfaces, or subcomponents used in semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The method developed here is covering the characterization of flatness on mirror-like surfaces within three orders of magnitude from micro- to nanometer scale. This {{is due to the}} high range of detectable surface slopes from very low to relatively high values. Therefore, the method is applicable to both, micro- and nanometer scale height deviations on surfaces. The wave front sensing is capable of studying the topography in a real-time operating mode. The technique enables vertical resolution of approximately 10 nm at a lateral resolution of 0. 6 mm on bare silicon wafer surfaces. Moreover, highly reflective surfaces with height deviations of 10 - 15 µm could be easily resolved at a lateral resolution of 2. 4 mm. In this study, we focused on the application in semiconductor surfaces and manufacturing equipment: measurements were performed on bare wafers {{as well as on the}} mirror-like surface of a <b>wafer</b> <b>holder</b> used for wafer polishing (a 'polishing head'). An obstacle for measurements is a low reflectivity of surfaces. Both, metallic surfaces and silicon wafers, however, show high surface reflectivity...|$|E
40|$|Novel micro {{patterning}} {{techniques have}} been developed for the patterning of volatile functional materials which cannot be conducted by conventional photolithography. First, in order to create micro patterns of volatile materials (such as bio-molecules and organic materials), micro-contact printing and shadow mask methods are investigated. A novel micro-contact printing technique was developed to generate micro patterns of volatile materials with variable size and density. A PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane) stamp with 2 -dimensional pyramidal tip arrays has been fabricated by anisotropic silicon etching and PDMS molding. The variable size of patterns was achieved by different external pressures on the PDMS stamp. A novel inking process was developed to enhance the uniformity and repeatability in micro-contact printing. The variable density of patterns could be obtained by alignment using x-y transitional stage and multiple stamping with a z-directional moving part. Second, for direct patterning of small molecule organic materials (e. g. pentacene), a novel shadow mask method has been developed with a simple and accurate alignment system. To make accurate dimensions of patterning windows, a silicon wafer was used for the shadow mask since a conventional semiconductor process gives a great advantage for accurate and repeatable fabrication processes. A sphere ball alignment system was developed for the accurate alignment between the shadow mask and the silicon substrate. In this alignment system, four matching pyramidal cavities were fabricated {{on each side of the}} shadow mask and silicon wafer substrate using an anisotropic silicon bulk etching. By placing four steel spheres in between the matching cavities, the self-alignment system could be demonstrated with 2 - 3 um alignment accuracy in x-y directions. For OTFT (Organic thin film transistor) application, an organic semiconducting layer was directly deposited and patterned on the substrate using the developed shadow mask method. On the other hand, novel embedding techniques were developed for enabling conventional semiconductor processes including photolithography to be applied on the small substrate. The polymer embedding method was developed to provide an extended processing area as well as easy handling of the small substrate. As an application, post CMOS (Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) integration of a relatively large microstructure which might be even larger than the substrate was demonstrated on a VCO (Voltage-controlled oscillator) chip. In addition, micro patterning on the optical fiber was demonstrated by using a silicon <b>wafer</b> <b>holder</b> designed to surround and hold the optical fiber. The micro Fresnel lens could be successfully patterned and integrated on the optical fiber end...|$|E
