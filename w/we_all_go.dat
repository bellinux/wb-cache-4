By that time, the weather had {{deteriorated}} even more and the sun had since set. Around 18:20, Taylor's last message was received. (It has also been reported that Taylor's last message was received at 19:04.)

500|$|After English {{actor and}} comedian Russell Brand {{divorced}} Perry in late December 2011, {{she was so}} distraught over the event that she considered committing suicide. Greg Wells, who assisted Perry with the composition of [...] "By the Grace of God", commented on the situation: [...] "I think she felt so kicked {{in the head and}} so publicly embarrassed at being divorced by a text message". After overcoming her suicidal thoughts and initial shock, she felt prompted to create a [...] "darker" [...] project as compared to her previous albums. Instead, she channelled the entire divorce event into [...] "By the Grace of God", in which its lyrics depict Perry battling against her suicidal thoughts while lying on her bathroom floor. During an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Perry spoke on how she felt during the breakup: [...] "Imagine what you go through. Imagine what happens when you go through a break up. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>go</b> through break ups and we all get very depressed and desperate." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Tik Tok" [...] was {{directed}} by Syndrome. It was shot in Kesha's old neighborhood and the car featured in the video belongs to her. Kesha explained the experience saying, [...] "the video I'm excited about because I actually got to shoot it in my old neighborhood and the guy driving my gold car {{is a friend of}} mine". The video's party scene was shot in her friend's house, which they refer to as the [...] "drunk tank". The singer said [...] "the last party scene is in this house called the drunk tank, which is one of my friend's houses that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>go</b> party at. So I like it cause its super-honest and genuine." [...] The video begins with Kesha waking in a bathtub in a home as she stumbles out and begins to look for a toothbrush in the restroom. She makes her way down a staircase looking at the pictures lining the wall. Kesha makes her way to the kitchen and walks in on a family who are having breakfast, startling them. She shrugs and then leaves the home as the family gets up and follows her. When she arrives at the sidewalk, she picks up a gold bicycle lying against a fallen fence and rides off. Kesha meets a group of children and trades the bicycle for their boombox. The video cuts to another scene where she rejects a guy and is picked up by a man portrayed by Simon Rex who drives her in a gold 1978 Trans Am. They are pulled over by the police, who handcuff Kesha. The scene then pans to her singing while standing in the T-top as she dangles the handcuffs hanging from her left arm. The next scene shows Kesha in an empty room filled with glitter. She then attends a party with Rex for the final scene. The video comes to an end with Kesha lying in a different bathtub from the one she woke up in. The official music video has received over 360 million views on YouTube as of July 2017.|$|E

On his [...] website, Foreman explains, [...] "I named all my sons George Edward Foreman {{so they would}} always have {{something}} in common.

2500|$|Justice Marshall wrote a {{detailed}} case {{for saying that}} the sleeping aspect of the demonstration, while overlooked by the majority, was a central part for the homeless cause.It is true that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>go</b> to sleep {{as part of our}} daily regimen and that, for the most part, sleep represents a physical necessity and not a vehicle for expression. But these characteristics need not prevent an activity that is normally devoid of expressive purpose from being used as a novel mode of communication. Sitting or standing in a library is a common-place activity necessary to facilitate ends usually having nothing to do with making a statement. Moreover, sitting or standing is not conduct that an observer would normally construe as expressive conduct. However, for Negroes to stand or sit in a [...] "whites only" [...] library in Louisiana in 1965 was powerfully expressive; in that particular context, those acts became [...] "monuments of protest" [...] against segregation.|$|E
