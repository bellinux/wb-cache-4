40|$|Among other {{diseases}} {{characterized by the}} onset of cachexia, congestive heart failure takes a place of relevance, considering the high prevalence of this pathology in most European countries and in the United States, and is undergoing a rapid increase in developing countries. Actually, only few models of cardiac cachexia exist. Difficulties in the recruitment and follow-up of clinical trials implicate that new reproducible and well-characterized animal models are pivotal in developing therapeutic strategies for cachexia. We generated {{a new model of}} cardiac cachexia: a transgenic mouse expressing Tpr-Met receptor, the activated form of c-Met receptor of hepatocyte growth factor, specifically in the heart. We showed that the cardiac-specific induction of Tpr-Met raises a cardiac hypertrophic remodelling, which progresses into concentric hypertrophy with concomitant increase in Gdf 15 mRNA levels. Hypertrophy progresses to congestive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, characterized by reduced body weight gain and food intake and skeletal muscle <b>wasting.</b> <b>Prevention</b> trial by suppressing Tpr-Met showed that loss of body weight could be prevented. Skeletal muscle wasting was also associated with altered gene expression profiling. We propose transgenic Tpr-Met mice as a new model of cardiac cachexia, which will constitute a powerful tool to understand such complex pathology and test new drugs/approaches at the preclinical level...|$|R

40|$|Many <b>Waste</b> Minimization/Pollution <b>Prevention</b> successes at the Hanford Site occur {{every day}} without formal recognition. A {{few of the}} {{successful}} projects are: T-Plant helps facilities reuse equipment by offering decontamination services for items such as gas cylinders, trucks, and railcars, thus saving disposal and equipment replacement costs. Custodial Services reviewed its use of 168 hazardous cleaning products, and, {{through a variety of}} measures, replaced them with 38 safer substitutes, one for each task. Scrap steel contaminated with low level radioactivity from the interim stabilization of 107 -K and 107 -C was decontaminated and sold to a vendor for recycling. Site-wide programs include the following: the Pollution Prevention Opportunity Assessment (P 2 OA) program at the Hanford site was launched during 1994, including a training class, a guidance document, technical assistance, and goals; control over hazardous materials purchased was achieved by reviewing all purchase requisitions of a chemical nature; the Office Supply Reuse Program was established to redeploy unused or unwanted office supply items. In 1994, pollution prevention activities reduced approximately 274, 000 kilograms of hazardous waste, 2, 100 cubic meters of radioactive and mixed waste, 14, 500, 000 kilograms of sanitary waste, and 215, 000 cubic meters off liquid waste and <b>waste</b> water. Pollution <b>Prevention</b> activities also saved almost $ 4. 2 million in disposal, product, and labor costs. Overall waste generation increased in 1994 due to increased work and activity typical for a site with an environmental restoration mission. However, without any <b>Waste</b> Minimization/Pollution <b>Prevention</b> activities, solid radioactive waste generation at Hanford would have been 25 % higher, solid hazardous waste generation would have been 30 % higher, and solid sanitary waste generation would have been 60 % higher...|$|R

30|$|The German {{government}} has still been {{guided by the}} ideas that <b>waste</b> and pollution <b>prevention</b> are the foremost aims to develop a circular economy.

50|$|<b>Waste</b> <b>prevention</b> strategiesIn {{planning}} for facilities, a comprehensive design strategy {{is needed for}} preventing generation of solid waste. A good garbage prevention strategy would require that everything brought into a facility be recycled for reuse or recycled back into the environment through biodegradation. This would mean a greater reliance on natural materials or products that are compatible with the environment.|$|E
50|$|In a {{circular}} economy, {{one way to}} minimize waste is through the employment of precycling insurance, which allows for {{a full range of}} financed <b>waste</b> <b>prevention</b> opportunities. This type of insurance would set premiums related to the risk of a product ending up as waste, and these premiums would serve to fund actions concerning <b>waste</b> <b>prevention.</b> When establishing a premium for precycling insurance several factors need to calculated: recyclability or biodegradability; provision of infrastructure, habitat or collaborations for the generation of the product from new resources; the ecosystem concentrations of product components above natural levels. The idea of precycling insurance is plausible considering the aim of insurance industries is to avoid losses rather than paying for losses. However, in order for this idea to work, private and third sectors need to be involved and engaged in the issue. In this instance, a third sector refers to small charities and a handful of societal enterprises that coordinate with charity shops.|$|E
