5|$|A single plant {{discovered}} by Nelson near Israelite Bay, <b>where</b> <b>both</b> putative parents are found, {{is regarded as}} a hybrid between A.cuneatus and A.dobsonii. Leaves are mostly triangular like those of A.cuneatus, but whereas A.cuneatus leaves are mostly five-lobed, the putative hybrid usually has three lobes, with the occasional leaf being entire like those of A.dobsonii (though A.cuneatis itself occasionally bears entire leaves). Leaves of the putative hybrid lack the thick indumentum of A.cuneatus, being bright green with a sparse indumentum like that of A.dobsonii. Flower colour is like that of A.cuneatus but the style lacks an indumentum, like A.dobsonii.|$|E

5|$|Downstream from {{confluence}} of the Drina, the Sava River changes its eastward course to northeast, until it reaches Sremska Mitrovica, from where it flows to the southeast and then south to Šabac, before finally turning east towards Belgrade. Most of the river's course in Serbia represents a border between province of Vojvodina, on the left bank, and Central Serbia, on the right bank. Exceptions to that are in area around Sremska Mitrovica, <b>where</b> <b>both</b> banks are in Vojvodina, and downstream of Progar suburb of Belgrade <b>where</b> <b>both</b> banks are in Central Serbia. The river meanders and forms wetlands in there as well—the most significant wetland among them centering on Obedska bara oxbow lake. The Sava River forms several large islands in this segment of the course, with the largest among them— Ada Ciganlija in Belgrade—connected to the right bank {{by a pair of}} artificial embankment dams forming Lake Sava since 1967.|$|E
