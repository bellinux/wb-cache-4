40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{research}} is to study the physiological mechanisms associated with the exercise performance of rats subjected to conditions of simulated weightlessness. A secondary purpose is to study related physiological changes associated with other systems.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} nature of conventional lexicalized metaphors, especially their degree of figurativeness, which is defined as their ability to activate conceptions from the source domain of the metaphor. The corpus in question consists of central words from the source domain WEIGHT. The analysis concentrates on collocations, the basic approach being to compare the metaphorical uses of a word with the non-metaphorical ones. The study demonstrates that the WEIGHT domain consists of two subdomains, partly distinct, partly overlapping: 1) the vikt subdomain primarily connected to <b>weighing</b> <b>procedures</b> with metaphorical meanings like 'importance' and 'consider'; 2) the tyngd subdomain primarily connected to gravitational effects on objects and bodies with metaphorical meanings like 'heaviness' and 'weigh upon'. Metaphors from the vikt subdomain were in general found to be less figurative, basically due to its conceptual nature. But there were also differences within the same subdomain. Some words seem metaphorically projected one by one, rather than as parts of a conceptual unity. The degree of figurativeness can therefore be said to depend on both (sub) domain properties and on lexical properties specific to the lexicalized metaphorical item. ...|$|E

The utility of a synthetic method may be greatly reduced if it relies on a glove box to enable the use of air- and moisture-sensitive reagents or catalysts. Furthermore, many synthetic chemistry laboratories have numerous containers of partially used reagents that have been spoiled by exposure to the ambient atmosphere. This is exceptionally wasteful from both an environmental and a cost perspective. Here we report an encapsulation method for stabilizing and storing air- and moisture-sensitive compounds. We demonstrate this approach in three contexts, by describing single-use capsules that contain all of the reagents (catalysts, ligands, and bases) necessary for the glove-box-free palladium-catalysed carbon-fluorine, carbon-nitrogen, and carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to measure power values {{generated}} in elite karate fighters during brief high intensity cycle ergometry when resistive forces were derived from total - body mass (TBM) or fat - free mass (FFM). Male international karate practitioners volunteered as participants (n = 11). Body density was calculated using hydrostatic <b>weighing</b> <b>procedures</b> with fat mass ascertained from body density values. Participants were required to pedal maximally on a cycle ergometer (Monark 864) against randomly assigned loads ranging from 70 g·kg- 1 - 95 g·kg- 1 (using a TBM or FFM protocol) for 8 seconds. The resistive force that produced the highest peak power output (PPO) for each protocol was considered optimal. Differences (p 0. 05) were observed between time to PPO, or heart rate when the TBM and FFM protocols were compared. The findings of this study suggest that when high intensity cycle ergometer resistive forces are derived from FFM, greater peak powers can be obtained consistently in karate athletes. Resistive forces that relate to the active muscle tissue utilised during this type of exercise may need to be explored in preference to protocols that include both lean and fat masses.

Previous studies (Bohgard et al., 1994) of simulations of pouring of pigments, which occur in small scale <b>weighing</b> <b>procedures,</b> showed typically bimodal size distribution including a sub-micron and a super-micron mode. The objective {{of the study was}} to get detailed knowledge on the relation between different source processes (depending on production technology, equipment and the manual handling routines) and aerosol characteristics. Super-micron particles were continuously measured with a time-of-flight instrument (Aerodynamic Particle Sizer, APS TSI Inc.) and sub-micron particles with an electric mobility spectrometer (Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer, SMPS TSI Inc.). In addition filter sampling techniques for standardised work-place sampling (so-called total dust filter cassettes, a cyclone sampler for respirable dust and IOM-samplers for inhalable dust) have been used for idealised exposure/area measurements using a rotating mannequin as a carrier of these samplers. The filters were analysed gravimetrically and with Particle Induced X-ray Emission Analysis. The aerosols were measured during manufacturing of batches of paint. Sources and source mechanisms, as pouring pigments from bags, disposal of packages, mixing of powders and pigments and suspected re-suspension sources, were documented simultaneously with the performance of the measurements. Figure 1 shows examples of size distributions obtained with the APS and SMPS. The size distributions have essentially bimodal shapes with median diameters of 0. 05 - 0. 4 [mu]m and of 2 - 5 [mu]m respectively. Rapid variation in concentration occurs. Preliminary results show that several sources occur. Irregular activities and events as disposal of package material, cleaning, leakage from conveyor tubes and re-suspension due to wind velocities from open gates and moving vehicles significantly contribute to the particle concentrations. Filter sampling with the samplers mounted on a mannequin torso, rotating 360 degrees forth and back, is advantageous by giving idealised measures on exposure. Samplers mounted on equal horizontal level will have equal sampling location integrated over time. Furthermore, the sampling procedure emulate sampling in accordance with sampling conventions. Inlet characteristics of samplers mounted on a body differ from characteristics of free-hanging samplers (Vincent, 1989).

Turgor pressure was correlated with the other two hydration indexes using approximations of leaf volumetric elastic modules. Similar estimates were obtained because the decline between turgor pressure and the natural logarithm of these relative leaf hydration indexes was numerically similar (@ 900 kPa). However, the volumetric hydration index seemed to be more suitable as a model, not only for being more concise but also because it showed a clearer biomechanical representation of the leaf water deficit effects...|$|R

Dried and concentrated NCBMs can be weighed with greater accuracy. For each of the four types of NCBNFs, a 30 -g sample was heated using a moisture analyzer (MX- 50, A&D, Japan) to remove moisture; the NCBM concentration in the NCBNF sample was then estimated based on the remaining weight (weighing method). Because the highest resolution of the moisture analyzer was 1.0  mg, to improve accuracy, we used a high-precision electronic balance (0.01  mg/ 42  g, GR 202, A&D, Japan) to weigh samples before and after drying. The entire <b>weighing</b> <b>procedure</b> was repeated five times, producing 10 data (each iteration of the procedure produced one datum measured using the moisture analyzer and another datum measured according to the high-precision electronic balance).

The technique is based on the principles of magnetohydrodynamics: when the moving conductor interacts with an externally applied magnetic field, Lorentz forces are generated within the melt. During LFV, the counterforce to the Lorentz force is measured. Acting on the system that produces the external magnet field, this counterforce is proportional to the flow rate or the local velocity and the electrical conductivity of the melt. Hence, in application the knowledge of electrical conductivity is demanded. To this end we develop an electromagnetic technique for non-contact measurement of electrical conductivity of metal melts, termed Lorentz force sigmometry (LOFOS). During LOFOS, Lorentz forces are measured that are generated by a welldefined pipe flow for which mass flow rate is determined via a <b>weighing</b> <b>procedure.</b> The present paper describes the physical laws controlling LOFOS operation, shows the mathematical procedure of the evaluation of electrical conductivity and addresses the problem of calibration of a respective Lorentz force sigmometer. In detail, we present laboratory measurements at room temperature using solid metal bars and the liquid metal alloy GaInSn in eutectic composition as test melts. Here, uncertainty of measurement less than 0. 5 % and about 3 % for solid and liquid tests, respectively. Currently, high-temperature applications of LOFOS in tin and copper melts are on the way...|$|R
