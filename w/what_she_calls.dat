5|$|The {{account of}} Southchurch's {{provisioning}} was first {{made available to}} a wider audience through {{the writings of the}} English historian Helen Cam. Cam was responsible for groundbreaking work on the Hundred Rolls, and their relevance to English local government, through her Studies in the Hundred Rolls (1921) and The Hundred and the Hundred Rolls (1930). In both of these she made mention of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> '...the most picturesque series of extortions recorded in the Essex returns.' It was, however, in a paper published in the English Historical Review as early as 1916 that she gave the most detailed account of Southchurch's plot. Here she traced the dissemination of the Viking legend through Geoffrey of Monmouth, and speculated that Southchurch could have been acquainted with a later version by Gaimar, Wace or Layamon, or through a local, popular legend.|$|E

500|$|In her 1987 paper, Reflections on Theology and Peace, Ursula Franklin {{contends that}} [...] "peace {{is not the}} absence of war—peace {{is the absence of}} fear." [...] She asserts however, that fear of war and {{violence}} is not the only kind of fear that destroys peace. She includes fears arising for example, from economic insecurity, unemployment and the lack of adequate shelter. Franklin points to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> [...] "the threat system" [...] which manages people by instilling fear and uncertainty at all levels of society.|$|E
500|$|Theodore {{meets with}} Catherine at a {{restaurant}} to sign the divorce papers and he mentions Samantha. Appalled {{that he can be}} romantically attached to <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> a [...] "computer," [...] Catherine accuses Theodore of being unable to deal with real human emotions. Her accusations linger in his mind. Sensing that something is amiss, Samantha suggests using a sex surrogate, Isabella, who would simulate Samantha {{so that they can be}} physically intimate. Theodore reluctantly agrees, but is overwhelmed by the strangeness of the experience. Terminating the encounter, he sends a distraught Isabella away, causing tension between himself and Samantha.|$|E

In a 2005 interview with The Jakarta Post, Utami said that her critique of the New Order is still relevant; {{at the time of}} the interview, she saw the Suharto government as having left Indonesia with a legacy of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> [...] "nuclear waste", including a loss of Indonesia's agricultural ability. In the interview, Utami also noted that Indonesians had become corrupt and lazy, increasingly bureaucratic, and without a feeling of sportsmanship.|$|E
500|$|As a {{displaced}} girl, Maya's pain is worsened by {{an awareness}} of her displacement. [...] She is [...] "the forgotten child", and must {{come to terms with}} [...] "the unimaginable reality" [...] of being unloved and unwanted; she lives in a hostile world that defines beauty in terms of whiteness and that rejects her simply because she is a Black girl. Maya internalizes the rejection she has experienced – her belief in her own ugliness was [...] "absolute". McPherson believes that the concept of family, or <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> [...] "kinship concerns", in Angelou's books must be understood {{in the light of the}} children's displacement at the beginning of Caged Bird. Being sent away from their parents was a psychological rejection, and resulted in a quest for love, acceptance, and self-worth for both Maya and Bailey.|$|E
500|$|As {{literary}} scholar Diane Long Hoeveler has demonstrated, Mary is {{not only}} a sentimental novel, but, with its emphasis on death, hyperbolic emotion, and persecution, also a gothic novel. Hoeveler identifies in the text <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> [...] "Gothic feminism", an ideology that values the persecuted heroine above all: it [...] "is not about being equal to men" [...] but rather [...] "about being morally superior to men. It is about being a victim". In other words, Hoeveler argues that the position of victim grants women moral authority. In a Freudian reading, she focuses on how Mary [...] "displaces and projects her own anger and disappointment" [...] onto other characters, such as Ann and Henry. In this interpretation, Ann and Henry become surrogate parents to Mary; she is [...] "unable to move out of her childish identifications with parental figures, and so she just keeps constructing one parent-substitute after another, never being able to accept the demands and realities required for marriage".|$|E

500|$|The novel {{creates a}} number of {{binaries}} between men and women. Michelle Phillips Buchberger argues that The French Lieutenant's Woman, along with Fowles two earlier novels The Collector (1963) and The Magus (1965), portrays a fundamental binary between {{the male and female}} characters: the female characters act as an elite set of [...] "creators" [...] or [...] "educated, visionary, and predominantly female" [...] characters who provide the facilitation for evolution [...] "in existential terms" [...] of the male [...] "'collectors', whose traits are present in all of Fowles's flawed male protagonists." [...] Though acknowledging such binaries {{in the role of the}} characters, critic Alice Ferrebe does not treat these binaries as necessary thematic elements. Rather, the binaries demonstrate <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> a gendered [...] "scopic politics", or a politics created by a gaze (not dissimilar from the [...] "male gaze" [...] noticed in cinema studies), that constructs an artificial gender binary within Fowle's early novels (as opposed to a multiplicity of socially constructed genders). For Ferrebe, this binary creates a tension, especially with Sarah, who becomes a violently fetishised and objectified [...] "other", differentiated from the male characters like Charles.|$|E
500|$|Central to Franklin's pacifism and {{her view}} of life is <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> [...] "the Quaker vision of the world". Individual {{conscience}} {{is at the heart}} of that vision. So too, is the need to discern appropriate ways of working for peace in each time and place [...] "rather than relying on a dogma of unvarying rules of conduct". She notes that for more than 300 years, Quakers have opposed war and violence and have objected to military service and conscription. They have worked on reconciliation, peace research and disarmament and in many countries have won the right for conscientious objectors to perform alternative service instead of taking part in war. Franklin remarks that Quaker principles have not changed, but technology has changed the nature of war. In a modern technological society she argues, there is no longer a clear boundary between war and peace. War planning is constant during peacetime and when wars are fought, women and children become targets. Nations no longer depend primarily on conscripting military recruits, but rely on advanced weapons systems that are costly to build or acquire. She writes that the arms race is driven by a [...] "technological imperative" [...] which requires the creation of an enemy as a permanent social institution: ...|$|E
500|$|Ursula Franklin {{explains}} in {{a prelude to}} her 2006 collection of papers, interviews and talks that her lifelong interest in structures, in what she terms [...] "the arrangement and interplay of the parts within a whole," [...] {{has been at the}} root of most of her activities. Looking back after almost 40 years, she adds, [...] "I can see how I have tried to wrestle with just one fundamental question: 'How can one live and work as a pacifist {{in the here and now}} and help to structure a society in which oppression, violence, and wars would diminish and co-operation, equality, and justice would rise?'" [...] As part of the answer, Franklin turns to the metaphor of mapmaking to explain her intellectual journey. [...] "Increasingly I found the maps of conventional wisdom inadequate for my travels," [...] she writes. [...] "I became unwilling and unable to orient my life according to national maps depicting the realms of 'them' and 'us,' of good guys and bad guys, of winning, defeating, and being defeated; in short, all those maps drawn up for travel towards private gain and personal advancement." [...] Franklin concludes that she has been guided in understanding <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> [...] "the real world" [...] by [...] "the maps of pacifism and feminism".|$|E

500|$|Modern critics find darker {{undertones}} in the novel. In {{an essay}} published in College English in 2001, Martine Dutheil states that The Coral Island {{can be thought}} of as epitomising a move away from [...] "the confidence and optimism of the early Victorian proponents of British imperialism" [...] toward [...] "self-consciousness and anxiety about colonial domination". She locates this anxiety in <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> the [...] "rhetoric of excess" [...] that features in the descriptions of cannibalism, and especially in the accounts of Fijian savagery provided by Bloody Bill (most notably that of the sacrifice of children to the eel gods) and the missionary, a representative of the London Missionary Society, an [...] "emblematic figure of colonial fiction". Others have also linked popular boys' fiction of the period with imperialism; Joseph Bristow's Empire Boys (1991) claimed to see an imperialist manhood,' which shaped British attitudes towards empire and masculinity." [...] The novel's portrayal of Pacific culture and the effects of colonisation are analyzed in studies such as Brian Street's The Savage in Literature: Representations of 'Primitive' Society in English Fiction (1975) and Rod Edmond's Representing the South Pacific: Colonial Discourse from Cook to Gauguin (1998). The domination imposed by [...] "geographical mapping of a territory and policing of its native inhabitants" [...] is an important theme in the novel both specifically and in general, in the topography of the island as mapped by the boys and the South Pacific's [...] "eventual subjugation and conversion to Christianity", a topic continued in Stevenson's Treasure Island.|$|E
500|$|They find a small structure, {{and from}} its top the woman spots people. As {{they leave the}} structure, they think of their sand castle, {{wondering}} about its fate. The screen flashes to a scene of a lone bucket floating on a body of water, then flashes back. After a bit more traveling, the characters make contact with three androgynous people wearing headgear. The woman attempts to communicate, but the native language of the people is incomprehensible. She shows them her wound, and they treat it with a paste. The group then beckon {{the man and woman}} to follow them into town. After receiving water, the man and woman sleep. The following morning, the man communicates with one of the locals by drawing pictures in the dirt. The local informs that the sea level is, in fact, rising, and that the two characters should follow and see someone to talk to. They rest while on the way, where the man and woman look over a map from one of the locals. They continue to a city, and a castle behind it. They are led to the natives' leader, who, speaking the language of the protagonists poorly, explains the reason for the sea rising. She reveals that her people had erected a berm to keep <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> [...] "the planet's mightiest river" [...] at bay, which is presently days away from breaking through and flooding the man and woman's home. She explains that the journey back to reach their home to warn the others living there would take too long and that they {{have no choice but to}} remain with the mountain people. Ignoring her, the man and woman flee and run back home, taking some of the mountain people's provisions on the way out and guiding themselves with maps that the woman had stolen.|$|E
