In October 2001, the studio hired screenwriters Christian Gudegast and Paul Scheuring for $1.2 million split between them to write a script for the film. Eventually, <b>without</b> <b>production</b> getting under way, the director and the writers left the project. In June 2004, Vince Vaughn spearheaded a revival of the project by presenting a take for the film that would develop the characters more strongly. Vaughn was cast as Racer X and was also attached to the project as an executive producer. With production never becoming active, Vaughn was eventually detached from the project.|$|E

Number 96 and The Box also released feature film versions, both of which had the same title as the series, released in 1974 and 1975 respectively. As Australian television had broadcast in black and white until 1975, these theatrical releases all had the novelty of being in colour. The film versions of Number 96 and The Box also allowed more explicit nudity than could be shown on television at that time.|$|E
500|$|The ArchAndroid is {{the second}} studio album and major label debut by American {{recording}} artist Janelle Monáe, released on May 18, 2010, by Wondaland Arts Society and Bad Boy Records. Production for the album took place at Wondaland Studios in Atlanta and was primarily handled by Monáe, Nate [...] "Rocket" [...] Wonder, and Chuck Lightning, with only one song <b>without</b> <b>production</b> by Monáe.|$|E
500|$|The song is 5 minutes, 52 seconds long, {{though the}} {{originally}} released version {{was less than}} 3 minutes. The song is built on a soulful sample of Smokey Robinson's quiet storm recording [...] "Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow", with an extended guitar solo. The song features a synth-heavy breakdown, complete with guitar riffs, before Ross arrives, spitting: [...] "I never needed acceptance from all you outsiders/ Had cyphers with Yeezy before his mouth wired/ Before his jaw shattered, climbing up the lord's ladder/ We still speeding, running signs like they don't matter." [...] It is the only album track <b>without</b> <b>production</b> by West, but features his characteristic style of manipulating the pitch and tempo of classic soul samples. West raps in a flow {{similar to that of}} rapper Nas, commenting about the women who have wronged him in the past and his struggles with religion.

500|$|The {{script was}} written by Jerry Gracio, {{influenced}} by the poem The Hound of Heaven, and won first prize at the scriptwriting competition hosted by the Film Development Council of the Philippines in 2000. This {{attracted the attention of}} Laurice Guillen, who bought the script (the first time in her career that she had done so) and signed on to direct the eventual film. The script was brought to Star Cinema, who became interested in producing it, but production stalled due to difficulties finding an appropriate actress to play Malen. Guillen stated that [...] "Since she was a Magdalene, she had to be sexy but she also had to be much more than that....I was shown many sexy actresses, some of them name stars, but I couldn't find my Santa-Santita. I felt that the role should go to someone relatively new, who had no fixed image, so {{that there would be no}} expectations". An additional problem was over the religious content of the film, which met with controversy. Guillen eventually found Angelica Panganiban to play Malen, and after five years <b>without</b> <b>production,</b> work on the film began for Unitel Pictures International, whose CEO stated that [...] "the majority of Filipinos, the so-called masses, are not the targets of this movie. Those who frequent the cineplexes and look for fresh material in the movies are". The title, Santa Santita, translates as [...] "saint who is not really a saint".|$|E
500|$|... "Devil in a New Dress" [...] {{is built}} on a sample of Smokey Robinson's [...] "Will You Love Me Tomorrow". Its lyrics are about lust and heartache, with sexual and {{religious}} imagery described by one critic as [...] "part bedroom allure, part angelic prayer". It is the only track <b>without</b> <b>production</b> by West but features his characteristic style of manipulating the pitch and tempo of classic soul samples. [...] "Runaway" [...] features a piano-based motif comprising a series of sustained descending half and whole notes, with a coda that incorporates light strings and vocoder-singing by West. The narrator's self-critical lyrics reflect on his personality and character flaws. Sean Fennessey cites the song as {{the point in the}} album in which [...] "self-laceration overtakes chest-beating", noting West's sung-line [...] "I'm so gifted at finding what I don't like the most". Inspired by his two-year relationship with model Amber Rose, [...] "Hell of a Life" [...] contains a psychedelic rock sample and a narrative about marrying a porn star. According to critic Ryan Dombal, the song [...] "attempts to bend its central credo— 'no more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need'— into a noble pursuit ... The song blurs the line between fantasy and reality, sex and romance, love and religion, until no lines exist at all. It's a zonked nirvana with demons underneath; a fragile state that can't help but break apart on the very next song". [...] "Blame Game" [...] is a low-key track about a painful domestic dispute. It features piano by producer Mike Dean, additional vocals by John Legend, and a profane skit by comedian Chris Rock.|$|E

Lil Wayne also appeared on a remix of Bobby Valentino's [...] "Tell Me", which rose to No. 13 on the U.S. R Charts. In 2005, Lil Wayne was named president of Cash Money, and in the same year he founded Young Money Entertainment as an imprint of Cash Money. However, as of late 2007, Lil Wayne reported that he has stepped down from the management of both labels and has handed management of Young Money over to Cortez Bryant.|$|E
