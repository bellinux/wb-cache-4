500|$|Saturday 22 March: a {{cold wind}} sweeps the plain of Pévèle; {{alternating}} showers of hail, melted snow and cold rain. Not a day to venture outside... Nevertheless, {{at the foot of}} the Mons-en-Pévèle ridge, silhouettes busy themselves along the soaked cobble roadway. Backs bent against the gusts, they tirelessly scratch at the ground with primitive tools. <b>Who</b> <b>are</b> <b>these</b> dozen souls— A work-gang from a byegone era? Automatons?

500|$|Among Britten's later song cycles with piano accompaniment is the Songs and Proverbs of William Blake, {{composed}} for the baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. This presents all its {{poems in}} a continuous stream of music; Brett writes that it [...] "interleaves a ritornello-like setting of the seven proverbs with seven songs that paint an increasingly sombre picture of human existence." [...] A Pushkin cycle, The Poet's Echo (1965), was written for Galina Vishnevskaya, and shows a more robust and extrovert side of the composer. Though written ostensibly {{in the tradition of}} European song cycles, it draws atmospherically on the polyphony of south-east Asian music. <b>Who</b> <b>Are</b> <b>These</b> Children? (1969), setting 12 verses by William Soutar, is among the grimmest of Britten's cycles. After he could no longer play the piano, Britten composed a cycle of Robert Burns settings, A Birthday Hansel (1976), for voice and harp.|$|E
2500|$|Some reviewers were unfavorable. One {{complaint}} {{was that the}} movie's pacing was too slow; while {{this may have been}} intended to convey a dream state, critics objected that it made actions and decisions seem labored. Another {{complaint was}} that since Kubrick shot the scenes set in New York City on a sound stage, the result was that they felt inauthentic. In The Washington Post, Stephen Hunter wrote, [...] "Kubrick is annoyingly offhand {{while at the same time}} grindingly pedantic; plot points are made over and over again, things are explained till the dawn threatens to break in the east, and the movie stumbles along at a glacial pace." [...] David Edelstein of Slate dismissed it as [...] "estranged from any period I recognize. <b>Who</b> <b>are</b> <b>these</b> people played by Cruise and Kidman, who act as if no one has ever made a pass at them and are so deeply traumatized by their newfound knowledge of sexual fantasies--the kind that mainstream culture absorbed at least half a century ago? [...] <b>Who</b> <b>are</b> <b>these</b> aristocrats whose limos take them to secret masked orgies in Long Island mansions? Even dream plays need some grounding in the real world." [...] J. Hoberman wrote that the film [...] "feels like a rough draft at best." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Baseball:" [...] Midland High has a {{historically}} excellent program with numerous state championships. The last {{of which was}} achieved during the 1997-1998 school year. Given their underdog status, that championship team embraced the slogan, and Midland Daily News Headline- <b>Who</b> <b>are</b> <b>these</b> guys?- [...] The semi-final matchup was between Brighton and its Gatorade National Player of the Year and future Yankee Drew Stanton and Chemic star Matt Widenmier.

6000|$|When the Europeans {{came to this}} {{continent}} {{at the end of}} the fifteenth century they found it already inhabited by races of men very different from themselves.
