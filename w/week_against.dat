5|$|Clemson {{lost its}} first real test, a conference game at 15th-ranked Georgia Tech, but {{recovered}} {{to win the}} following <b>week</b> <b>against</b> Boston College. The Boston College win was Clemson's last for almost a month, however, as Clemson lost to nonconference opponent Texas Christian on September 26, then was defeated by ACC divisional foe Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Ewbank {{maintained}} through {{training camp}} that second-year Mike Taliaferro was the number-one quarterback and disappointed a sellout crowd at Houston's Rice Stadium by keeping Namath {{on the bench}} at the Jets' season opener. Ewbank felt that Namath might not be ready for several more weeks, but Werblin intervened. Namath saw his first regular season action in the AFL the next <b>week</b> <b>against</b> the Kansas City Chiefs (the former Dallas Texans), and he was starting quarterback the following <b>week</b> <b>against</b> the Buffalo Bills. Namath's performance was inconsistent as he gained pro experience, but he was named AFL Rookie of the Year. The Jets finished the season 5–8–1 again. Beginning in 1966, the Jets began to improve on the field behind Namath, who led them to a 6–6–2 record. That season, the NFL and AFL announced a merger, which would be effective in 1970. A championship game (it {{came to be known}} as the Super Bowl), played between the two league champions, would follow each season until the merger took place.|$|E
5|$|Texas {{had very}} few {{problems}} affecting the roster. Only one defensive starter missed a game due to injury. On offense, starting running back Selvin Young injured his ankle {{in the game}} against Louisiana-Lafayette and re-injured it the following <b>week</b> <b>against</b> Ohio State. He did not play in the games against Rice or Baylor. Receiver Jordan Shipley missed the entire season due to a pulled hamstring.|$|E

5|$|During the 2010 {{regular season}} and playoffs, Kafka was {{inactive}} as the team's third quarterback for all but five games. In week two Kafka was the backup to Vick against the Detroit Lions after Kolb suffered a concussion in <b>week</b> one <b>against</b> the Green Bay Packers. In <b>Week</b> 5 <b>against</b> the San Francisco 49ers, <b>week</b> six <b>against</b> the Atlanta Falcons and <b>week</b> seven <b>against</b> the Tennessee Titans, Kafka was the backup to Kolb after Vick, who took over as the starting quarterback {{for the remainder of}} the season, suffered a rib injury in <b>Week</b> 4 <b>against</b> the Washington Redskins. In the <b>week</b> seventeen game <b>against</b> the Dallas Cowboys, Kafka was the backup quarterback to Kolb in a decision to rest Vick and the team's starters before the playoffs.|$|R
5|$|After the Falcons traded Favre to the Packers, Miller and Tolliver {{were the}} only quarterbacks on the roster. Before the season started, Wade Wilson signed with the team, and the two shared the role of backup to Miller. Tolliver played two of the first eight games, then was named the {{starting}} quarterback when the Falcons lost Miller for the season {{as a result of}} reconstructive surgery on his left knee. Tolliver's first start of the season came against the 49ers. He completed 16 of 25 passes, but threw three interceptions in a 41–3 loss. The next <b>week</b> <b>against</b> the Cardinals, Tolliver was benched for the final series as Wilson led the team to victory and Tolliver argued with coach Jerry Glanville. Despite the conflict and a shoulder injury, Glanville gave Tolliver the start the following <b>week</b> <b>against</b> the Buffalo Bills. He played a few more games before being replaced by Wilson {{for the rest of the}} season, partially as a result of Wilson throwing five touchdown passes in his first start en route to a 35–7 Falcons victory. Tolliver finished the season with five touchdowns, five interceptions, a 55.7% completion percentage, and a 70.4 QB rating.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2003 season, both Jason Whittle and Mike Rosenthal {{left the}} Giants via free agency, leaving two {{starting}} positions {{open on the}} offensive line. By {{the start of the}} Giants' pre-season minicamp, Allen was considered the favorite to start at right tackle, but he remained in competition with four other players for the two starting roles. The newly constructed right side of the offensive line played poorly in the first preseason game against the New England Patriots, but Allen showed enough improvement the following <b>week</b> <b>against</b> the Carolina Panthers to be named the starter going into the regular season.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} game of the season, the Hokies lived up to expectations, {{shutting}} out James Madison University, 470. The game was the first time Tech had shut out an opponent in a season opener since 1953. The game was marred, however, by a leg injury to Michael Vick that caused him to leave the game. The following <b>week,</b> <b>against</b> the University of Alabama Birmingham, Vick did not play. Despite his absence, the Hokies still managed a 3110 win. This was followed by a 3111 Thursday-night victory over Clemson in Virginia Tech's first game against a Division I-A opponent during the season.|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} week, the winners {{from the first}} <b>week</b> played <b>against</b> the other winners, and the losers from the first <b>week</b> played <b>against</b> the other losers.|$|R
50|$|Floyd was a {{starting}} defensive tackle next to Linval Joseph in the 2015 season. Floyd recorded {{a half a}} sack in <b>Week</b> 3 <b>against</b> the San Diego Chargers, and half a sack in <b>Week</b> 6 <b>against</b> the Kansas City Chiefs. He did not play in <b>Week</b> 7 <b>against</b> the Detroit Lions due to a knee/ankle injury. He was still hampered by the injury and was listed inactive for the <b>Week</b> 8 match-up <b>against</b> the Chicago Bears.|$|R
50|$|Brown has {{returned}} five touchdowns in his career, from three interceptions and two fumbles. He had a 40-yard touchdown {{return from a}}n interception during <b>Week</b> 4 <b>against</b> the Kansas City Chiefs of the 2005 season and an 80-yard touchdown return from a fumble during <b>Week</b> 5 <b>against</b> the Dallas Cowboys of the 2005 season. Brown had a 70-yard touchdown return from an interception during <b>Week</b> 10 <b>against</b> the Washington Redskins of the 2006 season. Brown had an 83-yard touchdown return from an interception off of a pass from Chris Redman during <b>Week</b> 12 <b>against</b> the Atlanta Falcons of the 2009 season. Brown had a 60-yard fumble return for touchdown during <b>Week</b> 14 <b>against</b> the New York Giants of the 2009 season.|$|R
5|$|NC State {{began the}} 1986 college {{football}} season coming off three consecutive losing seasons. Those losing seasons {{also resulted in}} the firing of head coach Tom Reed, who was replaced by Dick Sheridan. Sheridan's first game with the Wolfpack was at home against East Carolina on September 6. It was an auspicious beginning, as NC State won, 3810. After a 1414 tie the next <b>week</b> <b>against</b> Pittsburgh, the Wolfpack won their next two games: at home against Wake Forest, and in Maryland against Maryland.|$|E
5|$|New York won the {{following}} <b>week</b> <b>against</b> Minnesota before facing the Buffalo Bills in their regular season home finale. Despite holding a significant advantage {{in time of}} possession, they lost 17–13, for their third loss in four games. To compound New York's problems, Phil Simms went down with an injury that would sideline him {{for the rest of}} the year. His replacement, Jeff Hostetler, was an unproven career backup, who had thrown a mere 68 passes coming into the season.|$|E
5|$|On October 26, 2014, Smith caught four {{passes for}} 51-yards and two {{touchdown}}s, as he helped Joe Flacco set the NFL {{record for the}} fastest time to record five touchdown passes (16 minutes and 3 seconds). The Ravens defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 48-17. The following <b>week,</b> <b>against</b> the Atlanta Falcons, Smith would score the game-sealing touchdown. With {{less than two minutes}} left in the game and facing a fourth down, Flacco threw a pass to Smith, and he caught it in for a 39-yard score. Smith would finish the game with three receptions, 81 yards and the 39 yard touchdown, as the Ravens won of 29-7.|$|E

Batista defeated Cena at SummerSlam; shortly after, he was named one of four contenders for CM Punk's World Heavyweight Championship in the Championship Scramble match at Unforgiven. He was replaced by Rey Mysterio, however, after Cena suffered a herniated disc in his neck, which required surgery. Cena underwent successful surgery to repair the injury.|$|E
5|$|The Giants rallied {{and won the}} {{following}} <b>week</b> <b>against</b> the Minnesota Vikings before facing the Buffalo Bills in their regular season home finale. Despite holding the Bills' powerful offense to 17 points, the Giants lost 17–13, for their third loss in four games. To compound the team's problems, Phil Simms suffered a broken foot that {{put him on the}} sidelines {{for the rest of the}} season. His replacement, Jeff Hostetler, had been with the team since 1984, but had thrown just 68 passes coming into the season.|$|E
5|$|A four-sport athlete at Kathleen High School, Mitchell {{committed}} to UCLA {{to play football}} for the Bruins. In his collegiate debut in 1998, he had four receptions for 108yards, including a 79-yard touchdown from Cade McNown, {{as well as a}} 34-yard touchdown pass to Brian Poli-Dixon. Mitchell broke his femur the following <b>week</b> <b>against</b> Houston and missed most of the season. Limited by a knee cartilage injury throughout the 1999 season, he finished with 38 receptions for 533yards. As a junior in 2000, Mitchell was a Fred Biletnikoff Award finalist and earned first-team All-Pac-10 honors {{at the conclusion of the}} season. In the 2000 Sun Bowl, he had nine catches for a Sun Bowl record of 180yards. He declared for the 2001 NFL Draft following the 2000 season and finished his college career with 77 catches for 1,494yards and nine touchdowns.|$|E

Johnson finished his rookie season with 10 receptions for 102 yards and 2 touchdowns.|$|R
5|$|After another knee {{operation}} and rehabilitation period, Sayers attempted a comeback for the 1971 season. He was {{kept out of}} the first three games after carrying the ball only twice in the preseason, as Bears head coach Jim Dooley planned to slowly work him back into the rotation. His first game back was against the New Orleans Saints on October 10, in which he carried eight times for 30 yards. After the game, he told reporters he was satisfied with his performance and that his knee felt fine. The following <b>week,</b> <b>against</b> the 49ers, he carried five times before injuring his ankle in the first quarter, an injury that ultimately caused him to miss the remainder of the season. He was encouraged to retire but decided to give football one last try. Sayers' final game was in the 1972 preseason in which he fumbled twice in three carries; he retired from professional football days later.|$|E
5|$|As a freshman, Manning {{began the}} season as the third-string quarterback. In the season opener against UCLA, Manning {{was one of three}} quarterbacks to come off the bench after starter Jerry Colquitt {{suffered}} a season-ending injury on the seventh play of the game. However, Manning was not able to generate any offense and was pulled from the game. During the season's fourth game, against Mississippi State, starter Todd Helton got injured and Manning took over. The Vols lost 24–21, but Manning was named the team's starter and remained so {{for the rest of his}} college career. In his first start, the following <b>week</b> <b>against</b> Washington State, the Vols won 10–9. They won all but one of their remaining games, finishing the season 8–4 with a 45–23 victory over Virginia Tech in the 1994 Gator Bowl.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of his loan spell at Accrington, Symes was one of five signings made by their manager John Coleman on the same day at the start of {{pre-season}} training in July 2009. Symes scored his first goal of the new season with a late consolation goal for Accrington in a 2–1 League Cup defeat to Queens Park Rangers, before scoring his first league goal later the same <b>week</b> <b>against</b> former team Shrewsbury Town but in another defeat. After an improved run of form, Symes' first two-goal haul for Accrington in a 5–3 victory over another of his former teams, Crewe Alexandra, helped his new side into the top-half of the League Two table. Symes also scored goals in the FA Cup and the Football League Trophy, helping Accrington to the third round of the former competition and into the northern zone semi-finals against Leeds United in the latter.|$|E
