25|$|Storage depth, {{also known}} as living depth, is the {{pressure}} in the accommodation sections of the saturation habitat — the ambient pressure under which the saturation divers live when not engaged in lock-out activity. Any change in storage depth involves a compression or a decompression, {{both of which are}} stressful to the occupants, and therefore dive planning should minimize the need for changes of living depth and excursion exposures, and storage depth should be as close as practicable to the <b>working</b> <b>depth,</b> taking into account all relevant safety considerations.|$|E
25|$|The {{share is}} {{the cutting edge}} of the {{moldboard}} plow. The share makes the horizontal cut that separates the furrow slice from the soil below and when it is worn it is important to fit a new one. Conventional shares have points that are shaped. This shape, which was developed through years of field experience, penetrates ordinary soil efficiently and stands rough use. The share is shaped so that it pulls itself into the ground. As the share wears away, it becomes blunt and the plough will require more power to pull it through the soil. A plough body with a worn share will not have enough 'suck' to ensure that it penetrates the ground to its full <b>working</b> <b>depth.</b> The tip of the share is pointed downward, causing the plow to run into the ground. This is called “suction or down suck”; it literally sucks the plow into the ground, to a regulated depth. The clearance, also usually referred to as “suction or down suck”, varies with different makes and types of plows (the related clearance at the side is called “land suck”). Its configuration is related to soil type, particularly in the down suction, or concavity, of its lower surface. Generally, three degrees of clearance or down suction are recognized: regular for light soil, deep for ordinary dry soil, and double-deep for clay and gravelly soils. In addition, the share has horizontal suction, which is related to the amount its point is bent out of line with the landside. Down suction causes the plow to penetrate to proper depth when pulled forward, while horizontal suction causes the plow to create the desired width of furrow. The share is a plane part with trapezoidal shape. It cuts the soil horizontally and lifts it. Common types are regular, winged-plane, bar-point, and share with mounted or welded point. The regular share conserves a good cut but is recommended on stone-free soils. The winged-plane share is used on heavy soil with a moderate amount of stones. The bar-point share can be used in extreme conditions (hard and stony soils). The use of the share with mounted point is somewhere between the last two types. Manufacturers have designed shares of various shapes (trapezium, diamond, etc.) with bolted point and wings, often separately renewable. Sometimes the share cutting edge is placed well in advance of the moldboard to reduce the pulverizing action of the soil.|$|E

Saturation diving allows divers to remain at <b>working</b> <b>depths</b> without concern for decompression and it makes deep diving operations more efficient. Thermal comfort during the helium –oxygen breathing mixture saturation diving, was verified by experimental determinations and calculation of thermal flux density lost.

Flights of Quaternary {{river terraces}} in {{south and east}} England have common characteristics involving low-gradient planed or irregular bedrock surfaces and single or multi-storey gravel deposits. Rather than depending on warm?cold or cold?warm transitions, {{it is suggested that}} bedrock planation, ?<b>working</b> <b>depths?</b> of gravel and later-stage (relatively shallow) aggradations are all dominantly of cold-climate origin. Basal sediments show active incorporation of plucked and periglacially-shattered materials, whilst super-incumbent units incorporating up-catchment and slope-derived materials demonstrate later cold-stage sediment influx and consequent cessation of active bedrock erosion. Channel activity effecting both planation and deposition are reviewed, together with the detailed sedimentology of gravelly sediments which show evidence of both autogenic processes (bar migration, channel switching and infilling, and truncation of upper sedimentation units), cold-climate indicators (turbation, ice-wedge casts, and frozen block transport), and (specifically for the last glacial?interglacial cycle) varying sediment flux as climates changed. Both interglacial and ?transitional? activities are believed to be of lesser morphological significance, whilst prior uplift is taken as enabling rather than being a generator of terrace within the timescale of a glacial?interglacial cycle. Variations within cold-stage climates, varying sediment influx and channel-belt bedrock erosion are stressed as dominating mid-catchment and mid-latitude Quaternary terracing at the glacial?interglacial scale.
