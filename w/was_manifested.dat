5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} with {{a theme of}} individuality, which <b>was</b> <b>manifested</b> in the extensive customization options, {{the presence of a}} narrative, and the product's characterization as an adventure game. Real-world professional skateboarders contributed their experiences to the plot. Upon release, the game was a major critical and commercial success, with reviewers praising its wide appeal, soundtrack, customization, multiplayer, and plot. The graphics and the controls for driving vehicles and walking were less well received. Undergrounds PlayStation 2 version had sold 2.11 million copies in the United States by December 2007. A sequel, Underground 2, was released in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Much {{commentary}} {{has focused}} on the novel's depiction of njais, a subject common in contemporary Chinese Malay literature. Sumardjo describes the novel as an ode to njais, citing Marsiti's loyalty to Aij Tjeng and her pureness of purpose; Marsiti is ultimately recognised for her devotion when her grave in Cikembang is moved to Batavia, with empty spaces on either side for Aij Tjeng and Gwat Nio. Sumardjo finds subtle criticism of the Dutch and Chinese men who kept njais, showing the women as often becoming victims of their lovers. He suggests that this <b>was</b> <b>manifested</b> in the character of Keng Djim's unnamed njai (Marsiti's mother), who is banished after rumours spread that she has been unfaithful. Sutedja-Liem likewise emphasises the role of the njai within the story, considering the novel to be an ode to the love and loyalty of the concubines.|$|E
5|$|In 814, Wulfred {{travelled}} to Rome {{to visit}} Pope Leo III. Although {{the exact nature}} of his business with the pope is unknown, it was likely connected with the issue that arose between the archbishop and Coenwulf over lay control of monasteries. He was accompanied by the bishop of Sherborne, Wigberht. Laymen controlling monasteries had been customary for centuries, though in the half-century or so before Wulfred became archbishop the church had begun to assert control over monasteries. In England, this attempt to secure control <b>was</b> <b>manifested</b> in decrees made by synods at Clofesho in 803 and more especially the synod of Chelsea in 816. Tensions over the Kentish monastic houses of Reculver and Minster-in-Thanet reached such a point that Wulfred was deprived of authority by the king for a period of some years; six according to the document drawn up in 825 recording the– then victorious– Canterbury view of the debate, though four is perhaps more likely. Wulfred still witnessed documents as archbishop in 817, and by September 822, he was once more officiating as archbishop, when he consecrated King Ceolwulf of Mercia. Wulfred was driven into exile briefly at some point during his suspension from office. However, the dispute was still active {{in the last years of}} Coenwulf's reign, as at a council held perhaps in 821, the king threatened the archbishop with exile unless he yielded. Wulfred and the Canterbury community fought Coenwulf vigorously, sending embassies to the pope and concocting forgeries in their favour which purported to have been issued by earlier kings.|$|E

5|$|The {{violence}} and terror of Pontiac's War convinced many western Pennsylvanians that their {{government was not}} doing enough to protect them. This discontent <b>was</b> <b>manifested</b> most seriously in an uprising led by a vigilante group that {{came to be known as}} the Paxton Boys, so-called because they were primarily from the area around the Pennsylvania village of Paxton (or Paxtang). The Paxtonians turned their anger towards Native Americans—many of them Christians—who lived peacefully in small enclaves in the midst of white Pennsylvania settlements. Prompted by rumors that a Native war party had been seen at the Native village of Conestoga, on December 14, 1763, a group of more than 50 Paxton Boys marched on the village and murdered the six Susquehannocks they found there. Pennsylvania officials placed the remaining 16 Susquehannocks in protective custody in Lancaster, but on December 27 the Paxton Boys broke into the jail and slaughtered most of them. Governor John Penn issued bounties for the arrest of the murderers, but no one came forward to identify them.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} Dutch {{nationality}} is {{the emergence of}} a sense of national identity in the territory of the Netherlands. Consciousness of national identity <b>was</b> <b>manifested</b> through shared national obligations and rights such as taxation, military service, political and social rights, but most importantly through the concept of citizenship. Dutch nationality was forged through conflict which helped the people of the Low Countries develop a unifying idea of the Netherlander.|$|E
25|$|While Brazil was {{conducting}} its nuclear activities {{outside of the}} nuclear non-proliferation regime, many {{in the international community}} doubted its stated peaceful intention. In addition to Brazil’s refusal to sign the NPT, the fact that the country was ruled by a hard-line military regime fuelled the suspicion that Brasília was pursuing a nuclear bomb. This opinion <b>was</b> <b>manifested</b> openly and implicitly by different nations as well as the international anti-nuclear movement. The most vehement of skeptics was the U.S., with countries like France, Canada, the UK and the Soviet Union also following suit in their doubts of Brazil.|$|E

He wrote that the rebels would keep their {{positions}} until everyone is killed from the shells of European warships, {{in order not to}} let the Turks remain in Crete. The letter was deliberately leaked to international newspapers, evoking emotional reactions in Greece and in Europe, where the idea of Christians, who wanted their freedom, being bombarded by Christian vessels, caused popular indignation. Throughout western Europe much popular sympathy for the cause of the Christians in Crete <b>was</b> <b>manifested,</b> and much popular applause was bestowed on the Greeks.|$|E

25|$|Kami are an ever-changing concept, {{but their}} {{presence}} in Japanese life has remained constant. The kami’s earliest roles were as earth-based spirits, assisting the early hunter-gatherer groups in their daily lives. They were worshipped as gods of earth (mountains) and sea. As the cultivation of rice became increasingly important and predominant in Japan, the kami’s identity shifted to more sustaining roles that were {{directly involved in the}} growth of crops; roles such as rain, earth, and rice. This relationship between early Japanese people and the kami <b>was</b> <b>manifested</b> in rituals and ceremonies meant to entreat the kami to grow and protect the harvest. These rituals also became a symbol of power and strength for the early emperors. See Niiname-sai (i.e., 新嘗祭, which also reads as Shinjō-sai).|$|E
25|$|The modern {{identity}} of Serbs {{is rooted in}} Eastern Orthodoxy and traditions. In the 19th century, the Serbian national identity <b>was</b> <b>manifested,</b> with awareness of history and tradition, medieval heritage, cultural unity, despite living under different empires. Three elements, together with {{the legacy of the}} Nemanjić dynasty, were crucial in forging identity and preservation during foreign domination: the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Serbian language, and Kosovo Myth. When the Principality of Serbia gained independence from the Ottoman Empire, Orthodoxy became crucial in defining the national identity, instead of language which was shared by other South Slavs (Croats and Bosniaks). The tradition of slava, the family saint feast day, is an important ethnic marker of Serb identity, and is usually regarded their most significant and most solemn feast day.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{this growth}} {{in both the}} size and role of the church, {{progress}} was intermittently undermined by internal conflict over churchmanship. This <b>was</b> <b>manifested</b> {{in the creation of}} competing theological schools (Trinity versus Wycliffe Colleges in the University of Toronto, for example), a refusal by bishops of one ecclesiastical party to ordain those of the other, and – in the most extreme cases – schism. This latter phenomenon was famously and acrimoniously borne out in the high profile defection of Edward Cridge, the Dean of the Diocese of British Columbia in Victoria, B.C., together with much of his cathedral congregation, to the Reformed Episcopal Church in 1874, although the movement was ultimately confined to that one congregation in a then-remote town together with a second parish in New Westminster, the then-capital of the originally separate mainland colony of British Columbia.|$|E

25|$|Northern Guatemala has {{particularly}} high densities of Late Pre-classic sites, including Naachtun, Xulnal, El Mirador, Porvenir, Pacaya, La Muralla, Nakbé, El Tintal, Wakná (formerly Güiro), Uaxactún, and Tikal. Of these, El Mirador, Tikal, Nakbé, Tintal, Xulnal and Wakná {{are the largest}} in the Maya world, Such size <b>was</b> <b>manifested</b> not only in the extent of the site, but also in the volume or monumentality, especially in the construction of immense platforms to support large temples. Many sites of this era display monumental masks for the first time (Uaxactún, El Mirador, Cival, Tikal and Nakbé). Hansen's dating has been called into question by many other Maya archaeologists, and developments leading to probably extra-regional power by the Late Preclassic of Kaminaljuyu, in the Southern Maya Area, suggest that Maya civilization developed in different ways in the Lowlands and the SMA to produce what we know as the Classic Maya.|$|E
25|$|Luo-rap is {{the second}} most {{dominant}} kind of hip hop that has also grown in Uganda, especially in northern Uganda. This was recognised after the late legend Lumix Da Don, a.k.a Lumumba Patrick. Lumix was an underground Ugandan rapper, record producer and CEO of Valley Curve Records. He is also the producer with the most singles produced and recorded. Most of Lumix’s singles were either freestyles or were written 5–10 minutes before being recorded. Due to his catchy and crystal clear rhyme delivery techniques, Lumix Da Don earned his place as the most quoted artist in Uganda. Lumix is credited for taking a path unknown by many and having one of the biggest fan bases in the history of Northern Uganda. He made hip hop the biggest genre in Northern Uganda. This <b>was</b> <b>manifested</b> by the thousands of fans who turned up for his burial.|$|E
25|$|Wardell's {{conversion}} to the Roman Catholic faith {{was the result}} of a period of deep internal reflection. This affiliation to a more high church ritual <b>was</b> <b>manifested</b> in his architectural interests which concentrated on the more Gothic designs of England's medieval architecture. For the remainder of his life he saw architecture as a means of praising God. He always had a room in his home set aside as a chapel for personal devotion which he visited several times during the course of a day. Dominating this room was an ancient carved wooden French cross that now belongs to the Melbourne Diocesan Historical Commission, who also own several other mementos of his persona devotion. Wardell also wrote, in particular two prayers devoted to the Virgin Mary, who he seems to have regarded as his especial saint. It is known that he frequently prayed for help and guidance when working on plans of church buildings.|$|E

25|$|Opposition {{pressure}} on the communist government <b>was</b> <b>manifested</b> in popular demonstrations and strikes, which ultimately resulted in an open, multiparty and democratic parliamentary election being held on 28 October 1990 in which the Round Table/Free Georgia bloc captured 54 percent of the proportional vote to gain 155 seats out of the 250 up for election, while the communists gained 64 seats and 30 percent of the proportional vote. The leading dissident Zviad Gamsakhurdia became {{the head of the}} Supreme Council of the Republic of Georgia. On March 31, 1991, Gamsakhurdia wasted no time in organising a referendum on independence, which was approved by 98.9% of the votes. Formal independence from the Soviet Union was declared on April 9, 1991, although it took some time before it was widely recognised by outside powers such as the United States and European countries. Gamsakhurdia's government strongly opposed any vestiges of Russian dominance, such as the remaining Soviet military bases in the republic, and (after the dissolution of the Soviet Union) his government declined to join the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).|$|E
25|$|A {{short time}} ago good news from {{the king and queen}} reached our Apostolic See {{relating}} that, at great cost and following difficult negotiations, they had obtained a concession from the Sultan of Babylon (that is, Cairo), who to the intense shame of Christians occupies the Holy Sepulchre of the Lord and the other Holy Places beyond the sea that were sanctified by the blood of this same Redeemer, to wit that friars of your Order may reside continuously in the church known as the Sepulchre and celebrate there Solemn Sung Masses and the Divine Office in the manner of the several friars of this Order who are already present in this place; moreover, this same Sultan has also conceded to the King and Queen the Cenacle of the Lord, the chapel where the Holy Spirit <b>was</b> <b>manifested</b> to the Apostles and the other chapel in which Christ appeared to the Apostles after his resurrection, in the presence of Blessed Thomas; and also the news of how the Queen built a convent on Mount Zion where, as is known, the Cenacle and the said chapels are located; where for some time she has had the intention of supporting twelve friars of your Order to assure the divine Liturgy in the church of the Holy Sepulchre, along with three laymen charged with serving the friars and seeing to their needs.|$|E
25|$|Aboriginally and {{in early}} {{historic}} times the shaman, called as medicine man or medicine woman (Tanacross deshen Upper Tanana dishin) {{was the central}} figure of Athabaskan religious life. The shaman within this culture was the middle man/woman between spirits and the native peoples. Magicoreligious practices included omens, charms, amulets, songs, taboos, and beliefs about the supernatural. Beliefs and practices were associated with certain animals, and many centered on hunting. Animal spirits appear to have predominated in Tanana spiritual life, although an evil spirit <b>was</b> <b>manifested</b> in a half-man, half-animal being. Spirits were influential {{in the activities of}} the living and in guiding the dead to their final resting place. Athabaskan shamans guarded people against the effects of bad spirits. The shaman also diagnosed various illnesses and restored the health of those harmed by bad spirits. The shaman could also provide the valuable service of scapulimancy, which predicted the location of game when hunting was scarce. According to cultural anthropologist Richard K. Nelson (who lived for extended periods in Alaskan Athabaskan villages), Athabaskan traditions teach that everything in nature is fundamentally spiritual and must be treated with respect. This includes not only avoiding waste, but also following an elaborate code of morality toward plants, animals, and the earth itself. For example, if an Upper Tanana man kills a wolf, he should never touch it until he formally apologizes and explains that his family needs it.|$|E
