Through powerful first-person narratives, the reports thoroughly examine <b>worker</b> <b>rights,</b> country by country, in today’s global economy. This first report, by renowned <b>worker</b> <b>rights</b> researcher Lance Compa, takes {{a hard look at}} Mexico’s century-long fight for independent, democratic trade unions and social justice. Compa puts Mexico’s labor law and practice to the test against international <b>worker</b> <b>rights</b> standards reflected in International Labor Organization conventions and the ILO’s 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work...|$|R

40|$|Many {{critics argue}} that trade {{agreements}} the United States enters into should demand more <b>worker</b> <b>rights</b> among the trading partners. Ideally, such <b>worker</b> <b>rights</b> should benefit {{the citizens of the}} trading partner and also U. S. trading companies, which would then compete on a more level playing field. But is this the way it works in real life? The author has done interesting analysis suggesting just that. In a time when there are many trade imbalances in the world, demanding <b>worker</b> <b>rights</b> may well lead to more balanced trade. ...|$|R

25|$|Several left-wing or socialist groupings have an overt {{environmental}} concern, whereas several green parties {{contain a}} strong socialist presence. For example, the Green Party of England and Wales features an eco-socialist group, Green Left, that {{was founded in}} June 2005 and whose members held a number of influential positions within the party, including both the former Principal Speakers Siân Berry and Dr. Derek Wall, himself an eco-socialist and Marxist academic. In Europe, some Green left political parties combine traditional social-democratic values such as a desire for greater economic equality and <b>workers</b> <b>rights</b> with demands for environmental protection, such as the Nordic Green Left.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} {{documented}} instances {{of the presence of}} young children at hazardous construction sites, {{due to a lack of}} child care facilities for women workers living and working in the labour camp style work sites. Furthermore, workers on the site of the main Commonwealth stadium have reportedly been issued with hard hats, yet most work in open-toed sandals and live in cramped tin tenements in which illnesses are rife. The High Court of Delhi is presently hearing a public interest petition relating to employers not paying employees for overtime and it has appointed a four-member committee to submit a report on the alleged violations of <b>workers</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|E
25|$|After a {{reluctance}} {{of the military}} to combat the nearly two thousand soldiers and sailors that rebelled between 3 and 4 October 1910, the Republic was proclaimed at 9 o'clock {{of the next day}} from the balcony of the Paços do Concelho in Lisbon. After the revolution, a provisional government led by Teófilo Braga directed the fate of the country until the approval of the Constitution in 1911 that {{marked the beginning of the}} First Republic. Among other things, with the establishment of the republic, national symbols were changed: the national anthem and the flag. The revolution produced some civil and religious liberties, although there was no advance in women's rights and in <b>workers</b> <b>rights,</b> unlike what happened in other European countries.|$|E

25|$|Those {{focused on}} working {{conditions}} included Friedrich Engels, whose book The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 would inspire the Marxist movement named for his collaborator, Karl Marx. In the United Kingdom the Factory Act was revised six further times between 1844 and 1878 {{to help improve}} the condition of workers by limiting work hours {{and the use of}} child labor. The formation of the International Labour Organization in 1919 under the League of Nations and then the United Nations sought to address the plight of workers the world over. Concern over working conditions as described by muckraker journalists during the Progressive Era in the United States saw the passage of new <b>workers</b> <b>rights</b> laws and ultimately resulted in the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, passed during the New Deal.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{different}} feminist perspectives on sex trafficking. The third-wave feminist perspective of sex trafficking seeks to harmonize the dominant and liberal feminist views of sex trafficking. The dominant feminist view focuses on [...] "sexualized domination", which includes issues of pornography, female sex labor in a patriarchal world, rape, and sexual harassment. Dominant feminism emphasizes sex trafficking as forced prostitution and considers the act exploitative. Liberal feminism sees all agents {{as capable of}} reason and choice. Liberal feminists support sex <b>workers</b> <b>rights,</b> and argue that women who voluntarily chose sex work are autonomous. The liberal feminist perspective finds sex trafficking problematic where it overrides consent of individuals.|$|E
