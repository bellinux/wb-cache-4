40|$|The {{question}} asked by many supply chain managers is 'what supply chain strategy {{is best to}} use to gain a competitive advantage?' This research argues that selection of a supply chain strategy represents only one facet, although essential, of realising the competitive advantage.

By waste, here, we mean anything that adds no value to the manufacturing of products or producing the required services. This paper offers a unique point of view about gaining competitive advantage from push-pull strategy through the systematic reduction of waste along the entire supply chain. The paper recognises the intra-organisation <b>waste</b> <b>zones</b> and identifies three main inter-organisation <b>waste</b> <b>zones</b> within a supply chain; information zone, strategic decisions zone and system variation zone.

30|$|Seepage erosion {{involves}} the detachment and entrainment of finer soil particles through a porous medium under a hydraulic gradient {{caused by the}} seeping water (Cedergren 1977). The various processes involved in seepage erosion mechanisms in hillslopes and landslide dams have been identified. For example, sapping, as defined by Hagerty (1991) involves exfiltration over a broad area on a sloping surface such that large lenticular cavities appear {{as a result of}} concentrated seepage which removes soil particles at the exit point and increases the diameter of the evolving channel over time. Iverson and Major (1986) derived a generalized analytical method for the evaluation of seepage forces considering static liquefaction and Coulomb failure under steady uniform seepage in any direction within a hillslope. They observed that slope destabilization occurred as a result of seepage force vector, which represents a body force that corresponds to the hydraulic gradient potential. They concluded that slope stability will invariably occur when the direction of the seepage flow is such that λ[*]=[*] 90 °-ϕ, whereas the existence of a vertically upward seepage component results in Coulomb failure at similar conditions required for static liquefaction, especially when the slope angle is more or less equal to φ. Howard (1988) used flume experiments and numerical simulations to evaluate sapping processes and sapping zone morphology in homogeneous, isotropic sand mixtures. His experiments identified three distinct zones at the sapping face: mass <b>wasting</b> <b>zone,</b> sapping zone and fluvial transport zone, whereas numerical simulations performed by Howard and McLane (1988) revealed that the rate of mass wasting at the sapping face is dependent on the rate of sediment transport through the fluvial transport zone.|$|R

40|$|The Closure Plan for the E-Area {{low-level}} waste facility assumes that dynamic compaction {{performed at the}} end of the 100 -year institutional control period will adequately stabilize all waste in Slit Trenches. However, some non-crushable waste containers with significant void space will not be stabilized by dynamic compaction. These non-crushable containers will gradually corrode, eventually collapse and cause the final closure cap to subside resulting in an increase of the infiltration rates. After subsidence occurs, the <b>waste</b> <b>zone</b> will be significantly reduced to concentrate waste in the lower portion of the slit trench, therefore increasing waste concentration. The trench subsidence may have an adverse impact on the 1000 -year compliance specified in DOE Order 435. 1.

40|$|Land {{treatment}} as a disposal {{technology has been}} extensively used for the disposal of oily wastes. Effective management of land treatment sites require optimal operation of the system {{in order to achieve}} the fastest and most complete degradation of petroleum hydrocar-bons without contamination of the environment. This paper describes a model {{that can be used for}} optimising the operation of land treatment sites for oily wastes. The model is composed of system simulator and optimisation submodels. Conceptually, the system simulation submod-el is composed of a <b>waste</b> mixing <b>zone,</b> lower treatment zone and aquifer modules. The system simulation model allows for periodic waste applications and determines the spatial and temporal variation of the state variables such as phase summed (total) and aqueous phase contami-nant concentrations and water content in the system. The optimisation submodel coupled with the system sim-ulator determines the optimal values of system control variables, such as waste loading rate, infiltration rate, water content, frequency of waste application and the dimensions of the land treatment site. Optimisation of these system control variables is accomplished by max-imising the hydrocarbon mass removal from the <b>waste</b> mixing <b>zone</b> under the constraint of satisfying a prespec-ified water quality criteria in the aquifer. Selected model applications are presented to demonstrate the applicabil-ity and utility of the model.

40|$|Activated metal is {{a special}} waste that {{requires}} evaluation for disposal. Contaminants in the activated metal will leach more slowly than will contaminants in generic waste. There is an inventory of activated scrap metal in the 105 -L Disassembly Basin. Approximately 1, 600 ft 3 of the material is characterized as ''No Dose/Low Dose'' and consists mainly of activated aluminum and aluminum alloy pieces and parts and no stainless steel with a dose rate less than 200 mR per hr. Contaminants in the activated metal will leach more slowly than will contaminants in generic waste. The change in the leach rate will affect analyses for the groundwater pathway and intruder scenarios. For this evaluation, the slower leach rate from the activated metal waste will be neglected for the groundwater pathway, which is conservative because the higher leach rate used tends to produce higher groundwater concentrations and lower inventory limits. For this evaluation, the leach rate was set to zero for intruder scenarios, which is conservative for the inadvertent intruder because a slower leach rate will result in higher levels of radionuclides in the <b>waste</b> <b>zone.</b> The evaluation concludes that the existing limits are applicable to the disposal of No Dose/Low Dose activated scrap metal in slit trenches so that a Special Analysis is not needed to dispose of this waste stream...|$|E
40|$|In-situ {{vitrification}} (ISV) is {{a process}} by which electrical energy is supplied to a soil/waste matrix. The resulting Joule heat raises {{the temperature of the}} soil/waste matrix, producing a pool of molten soil. Since its inception, there have been many successful applications of the technology to both staged and actual waste sites. However, there has been some difficulty in extending the attainable treatment melt depth to levels greater than 5 m. Results obtained from application of two novel approaches for extending the ultimate treatment depth attainable with in-situ vitrification (ISV) are presented. In the first, the electrode design is modified to concentrate the Joule heat energy delivered to the soil/waste matrix in the lower region of the target melt zone. This electrode design has been dubbed the hot-tip electrode. Results obtained from both computational and experimental investigations of this design concept indicate that some benefit toward ISV depth enhancement was realized with these hot-tip electrodes. A second, alternative approach to extending process depth with ISV involves initiating the melt at depth and propagating it in either vertical direction (e. g., downward, upward, or both) to treat the target <b>waste</b> <b>zone.</b> A series of engineering-scale experiments have been conducted to assess the benefits of this approach. The results from these tests indicate that ISV may be effectively initiated and sustained using this subsurface start-up technique.

40|$|The Beg-er-Vil coastal site (Quiberon, Morbihan, France), {{initially}} excavated in the 1980 s, {{and more}} extensively since 2012, {{is exposed to}} strong marine and anthropic erosion. At the present time, the main challenge is to define {{the status of the}} site by describing its formation dynamics. This necessitates investigating the taphonomic and erosive mechanisms using a combined method adapted to the shell midden levels, before undertaking spatial analysis. The archaeological level is protected by a thick dune and is subdivided into several stratigraphic units (SU), which record several changes in the function of the site. It is made up of accumulations of shell pockets covered in sandy sediments. The micromorphological analysis shows that this waste area seems to develop into an area of activities and movement. These surfaces also record alternating dry and wet seasonal conditions, but with no phase of abandonment. Systematic pH measurements show variations of 7. 7 to 9. 0 depending on the layers, corresponding to a slightly alkaline to alkaline acid-basic status. The mapping of measurements can be correlated to structures and archaeological remains of organic origin. The excavation shows that the division of the dwelling area was guided by topographic factors, with a circular dwelling 3. 50 m in diameter installed on a flat zone and a shell <b>waste</b> <b>zone</b> on a slope towards the sea. Numerous fire-related activities were also carried out in this zone (pits, hearths). Spatial analysis by GIS shows a high concentration of recorded objects (lithics, bones, shells) {{to the west of the}} excavated area, in the shell level. Marine erosion is the main erosive factor limiting our knowledge of the site. The distance to the coastline was estimated after reconstruction of the relative sea level during the Holocene using the “Sea-Level Index Points” (SLIPs) methodology. Three SLIPs indicate a relative sealevel position between − 15. 5 m and − 11 m and a foreshore area at a depth between − 7. 15 and − 14. 02 m around 6200 BCE.

40|$|Hydrocarbon {{migration}} {{is one of}} the key processes that takes place in the development of a successful petroleum system. Understanding when fluids migrated, how they migrated and which routes they took either into primary reservoirs or via transient seals into shallow reservoirs is paramount for successful extraction. Fluids in the sub-surface can be imaged in seismic reflection data as anomalously high reflection amplitudes owing to their contrasting acoustic properties (density and p-wave velocity) with sedimentary rocks. This thesis uses 3 -Dimensional seismic reflection data from the Møre Basin, offshore mid-Norway and the Lower Congo Basin, West African margin to investigate the migration of fluids from primary reservoir intervals through overlying successions of fine-grained sediments. These shallow intervals are typically considered as regional seal layers and understanding how seals were breached and fluids migrate through them is vital to risking exploration targets. The Møre Basin case study investigates a gas-associated amplitude anomaly at the crest of a domal structure cored with alternating fine-grained biosiliceous and calcareous ooze sediments. The anomaly has a rather unique convex-upward basal contact which is explained by the superposition of lateral velocity variations through the gas-filled dome. The centre of the dome has more gas than the flanks resulting in a lower velocity which pushes the basal contact to deeper positions with respect to the flanks. The domal trap was charged from gas migrating from depth via capillary entry pressure and possibly via sub-vertical pathways created by compaction-derived polygonal faults which pervasively deform the host stratigraphy. The Lower Congo case study investigates a range of high-amplitude seismic amplitude anomalies in a thick sequence of hemipelagites (the <b>waste</b> <b>zone)</b> above a deep-seated turbidite reservoir. Anomalies take many forms and include; Linear anomalies, Sub-circular anomalies, Patchy anomalies at which finger-shaped anomalies emanate from their lateral edges, and Discrete filamental anomalies. The Sub-circular and Patchy anomalies were interpreted as being related to the presence of hydrocarbons. Detailed analysis of a sub-set of the hydrocarbon-bearing amplitude anomalies suggest leakage occurred through two means; 1) vertical leakage through feeders and 2) via deep-seated extensional faults formed during gravity-driven gliding of vi an underlying salt detachment. Vertical leakage is expressed in the form of Vertical Anomaly Clusters which comprise vertically stacked assemblages of high-amplitude anomalies. A common aspect of the two case studies are that high-amplitude anomalies within fine-grained sedimentary successions are linked to vertical or sub-vertical migration pathways provided either by faults or pipe-like structures formed during overpressure. These results have implications for our understanding of how seals are breached when reservoirs are overpressured...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposed}} action of disposing of 52 moderator deionizer vessels within the ILV was evaluated in this SA. In particular, {{a detailed analysis}} of the release of {sup 14 }C via the atmospheric pathway was conducted for these vessels since the major concern has been the nearly 20 Ci of {sup 14 }C that is associated with each vessel. The more rigorous evaluation of the atmospheric pathway for {sup 14 }C included incorporation of new information about the chemical availability of {sup 14 }C when disposed in a grout/cement encapsulation environment, as will be the case in the ILV. This information was utilized to establish the source term for a 1 -D numerical model to simulate the diffusion of {sup 14 }CO{sub 2 } from the ILV <b>Waste</b> <b>Zone</b> to the land surface. The results indicate a peak surface emanation rate from the entire ILV of 1. 42 E- 08 Ci/yr with an associated dose of only 3. 83 E- 05 mrem/yr to the Maximally Exposed Individual (MEI) at 100 m. The fact that the atmospheric pathway exposure for {sup 14 }C is controlled by chemical solubility limits for {sup 14 }C between the solid waste, pore water and pore vapor within the disposal environment rather than the absolute inventory suggests that the establishment of specific facility limits is inappropriate. With the relaxation of the atmospheric pathway restriction, the groundwater pathway becomes the more restrictive in terms of disposing {sup 14 }C or {sup 14 }C{sub KB} within the ILV. Since the resin-based {sup 14 }C of the 52 moderator deionizer vessels is highly similar to the {sup 14 }C{sub KB} waste form, the inventory from the 52 deionizer vessels is compared against the groundwater limits for that waste form. The small groundwater pathway fraction (1. 14 E- 05) calculated for the proposed inventory of the 52 moderator deionizer vessels indicates that the {{proposed action}} will have an insignificant impact with respect to possible exposures via the groundwater pathway. This investigation recommends that there be no ILV Atmospheric pathway limit for {sup 14 }C and {sup 14 }C{sub KB}. Further, {{in the absence of an}} Atmospheric pathway limit it was determined that there are no other applicable ILV limits (Groundwater or Intruder pathway) that would be impacted in any significant fashion should the waste package be disposed within the ILV. Thus, it is concluded that the disposal of 52 moderator deionizer vessels can easily be accommodated within the ILV...|$|E

Due to its critical situation, the Mailuu-Suu region was and still is the target area for several risk assessment projects. This paper provides a brief review of previous studies, past landslide events and a discussion on possible future risk scenarios. Various aspects of landslide hazard and related impacts in the Mailuu-Suu Valley are analyzed in detail: landslide susceptibility, historical evolution of landslide activity, size-frequency relationship, river damming and flooding as well as impacts on inhabited areas and nuclear <b>waste</b> storage <b>zones.</b> The study was carried out with standard remote sensing tools for the processing of satellite imagery and the construction of digital elevation models (DEMs). The processed inputs were combined on a GIS platform with digital landslide distribution maps of 1962, 1977, and 2003, digitized geological and geographic maps, and information from landslide monitoring and geophysical investigation. As a result, various types of landslide susceptibility maps based on conditional analysis (CA) are presented as well as predictions of future landslide activity and related damming potential and their possible impact on the population. For some risk scenarios, remediation and prevention measures are suggested. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The <b>waste</b> {{effluent}} mixing <b>zone</b> {{is defined}} as the extent of a receiving water body utilized to dilute a waste charge to a concentration characteristic of a totally mixed condition. Color IR photography was used in conjunction with suspended solids water samples to quantitatively delineate the mixing zone resulting from the discharge of a paper mill effluent. Digital scanning microdensitometer data were used to estimate and delineate suspended solids concentrations {{on the basis of a}} semiempirical model. Model background, development, and implementation are described. Results indicate that the method is as reliable as conventional surface measuring techniques and is, in fact, more detailed. The method has direct application to the establishment of water quality guidelines, the development of both governmental and private sampling and surveillance programs, and the development of design and location criteria for industrial and municipal waste effluent outfalls...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this text}} is to {{illustrate}} the ways of biological rekultivation in Okrouhlá Radouň. There is a waste bank as a residue after the uranium industry. Waste banks are common in most of mining areas. In most cases is a postmining land use as a forest. In our case maybe the forest isn´t so appropriate because of the cumulative dominance of waste bank. Because of this reason is select a reclamative rotation of crops. Another period of rekultivation is a growing of energy crops or grass cover etc. It is important to make two parts of <b>waste</b> bank- flopping <b>zone</b> {{and the rest of}} waste bank. On each of this parts is applies different ways of rekultivation. Flopping zone is solved more carefully because of the dangerous of the tree-roots which can damage the modified waste bank...|$|R
40|$|A 6 month {{sampling}} plan {{was carried out}} in the Cesar River, which is used as the receiver of treated waste water from the stabilized ponds in Salguero Station. During this time cyanobacteria, potential producer of cyanotoxins, were identified, and also their abundance and variation in the distribution through the sampled area were estimated; fluctuations of physical and chemical characteristics of the area in study were evaluated. Three sample stations were established: upstream, the <b>waste</b> water flowing <b>zone,</b> and downstream. Standardized methods for the identification and recount of phycological material and to measure the physicalchemical parameters were used. The greater abundance of some cyanobacteria was closely related to the areas of the river where there is greater organic contamination. Cyanobacteria producers of toxins which were more predominant were Phormidium sp., Oscillatoria sp. and Pseudanabaena sp. The physicalchemical results indicate that the quality of the water in Cesar river is altered in the areas where the river receives the flow of waste warter and all along its steam...|$|R
