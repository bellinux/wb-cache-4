I hung around until 3am then left." [...] In the liner notes to , Richards stated, [...] "I remember writing the riff upstairs in the very elegant front room, and we took it downstairs the same evening and we cut it." [...] Jagger said of the lyrics, [...] "It's weird where your lyric things come from. On Tumbling Dice, I {{sat down with the}} house keeper and talked to her about gambling. She liked to play dice and I really didn't know much about it, but I got it off her and managed to make the song out of that." [...] He concluded, [...] " [...] 'Tumbling Dice' [...] " [...] was written to fit Keith's riff. It's about gambling and love, an old blues track." ...|$|E
500|$|Mercedes-Benz withdrew {{entirely from}} motor racing {{at the start}} of 1932 {{in the face of the}} {{economic}} crisis, so Caracciola moved to Alfa Romeo with a promise to return to Mercedes if they resumed racing. His contract stipulated he would begin racing for the Italian team as a semi-independent. Caracciola later wrote that the Alfa Romeo manager was defensive when he questioned him about this clause; Caracciola believed it was because the firm's Italian drivers did not believe he could change from the huge Mercedes cars to the much smaller Alfa Romeos. His first race for his new team was at the Mille Miglia; he led early in the race, but retired when a valve connection broke. Caracciola later wrote, [...] "I can still see the expression on [...] Campari's face <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> back at the factory. He smiled to himself as if to say, Well, didn't I tell you that one wasn't going to make it?" ...|$|E

2500|$|After his crash at Spa, Stewart {{became an}} outspoken {{advocate}} for auto racing safety. Later, he explained, [...] "If I have any legacy {{to leave the}} sport I {{hope it will be}} seen to be an area of safety because <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> in Grand Prix racing so-called precautions and safety measures were diabolical." [...] By Stewart's reckoning, a driver who raced for five years had a two-thirds chance of being killed in a crash.|$|E

2500|$|I kept {{up playing}} drums until I moved to London. I'd {{always wanted to}} be a good drummer and it's just ironic that I've turned out to be a bass player. The way I started playing bass was that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> in London I was looking for a job, and the only place I could find one was in Macaris in Charing Cross Rd. I wanted to get {{something}} involved in music, and that seemed like a good place to be. But Macaris didn't sell drums, and so I lied and said I could play bass. They said, [...] "Fine, you sell the basses, and sweep up and get the coffees and whatever".|$|E

The etiquette demanded that as Queen Dowager, she should not greet her daughter-in-law at the stair of the royal palace {{with the rest of}} the royal family, but wait for her in her own salon, but she refused: [...] "I know myself how I suffered, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> to Sweden, and how painfully I reacted to the cold reception I was given by Queen Louisa Ulrika. As for my daughter-in-law, I have decided to spare her from having to experience such bitter emotions!" [...] During the reign of her son, she seldom showed herself at court except on Sundays and at court presentations, and preferred to stay at her estate.

2500|$|In June 2011, it was {{announced}} that Madjo had joined League One side Stevenage on a free transfer. He signed a one-year contract with the club. Stevenage manager Graham Westley had previously tried to sign Madjo ahead of the 2008–09 season, but the player instead opted to seek a move abroad. On signing for Stevenage, Madjo said [...] "I have met the players at Stevenage, I really like the team and the way they looked after me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived.</b> I’m really looking forward to the new season and hope to score lots of goals for my new club". In July 2011, Westley stated that the signing of Madjo had been held up by an [...] "administrative hitch", and that there was a delay in transferring his registration — [...] "There are a couple of issues that need sorting out with his former club, but I'm hopeful that will resolve itself in the coming days". Stevenage announced that they had received international clearance for Madjo on 22 July. Madjo was not involved in any of Stevenage's first ten fixtures of the 2011–12 season, although was an unused substitute in a 4–3 defeat to Peterborough United in the League Cup on 9 August 2011. After scoring in a reserve match against Oxford United, Madjo made his first appearance of the season three days later, on 24 September, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 1–0 loss to Carlisle United at Brunton Park.|$|E
2500|$|Ford was legendary for his {{discipline}} and efficiency on-set and was notorious for being extremely tough on his actors, frequently mocking, yelling and bullying them; {{he was also}} infamous for his sometimes sadistic practical jokes. Any actor foolish enough to demand star treatment would receive {{the full force of}} his relentless scorn and sarcasm. He once referred to John Wayne as a [...] "big idiot" [...] and even punched Henry Fonda. Henry Brandon (who played Chief Scar from The Searchers) once referred to Ford as [...] "the only man who could make John Wayne cry"[...] He likewise belittled Victor McLaglen, on one occasion reportedly bellowing through the megaphone: [...] "D'ya known, McLaglen, that Fox are paying you $1200 a week to do things that I could get any child off the street to do better?". Stock Company veteran Ward Bond was reportedly one of the few actors who were impervious to Ford's taunting and sarcasms. Sir Donald Sinden, then a contract star for the Rank Organisation at Pinewood Studios when he starred in Mogambo, was not the only person to suffer at the hands of John Ford's notorious behaviour. He recalls [...] "Ten White Hunters were seconded to our unit for our protection and to provide fresh meat. Among them was Marcus, Lord Wallscourt, a delightful man whom Ford treated abysmally—sometimes very sadistically. In Ford's eyes the poor man could do nothing right and was continually being bawled {{out in front of the}} entire unit (in some ways he occasionally took the heat off me). None of us could understand the reason for this appalling treatment, which the dear kind man in no way deserved. He himself was quite at a loss. Several weeks later we discovered the cause from Ford's brother-in-law: before emigrating to America, Ford's grandfather had been a labourer on the estate in Ireland of the then Lord Wallscourt: Ford was now getting his own back at his descendant. Not a charming sight." [...] "We now had to return to the MGM-British Studios in London to shoot all the interior scenes. Someone must have pointed out to Ford that he had been thoroughly foul to me during the entire location shoot and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>arrived</b> for my first day's work, I found that he had caused a large notice to be painted at the entrance to our sound stage in capital letters reading BE KIND TO DONALD WEEK. He was as good as his word—for precisely seven days. On the eighth day he ripped the sign down and returned to his normal bullying behaviour." ...|$|E
