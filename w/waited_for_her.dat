5|$|When Minnie {{decided to}} take up {{painting}} in 2000 while she <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> daughter Barbara to complete a canvas in an Adelaide workshop, the reception was immediately positive: she had her first solo exhibition that same year at Melbourne's Flinders Lane Gallery. She was first selected to exhibit in the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award in 2002. One of her pieces, Awelye Atnwengerrp, was exhibited in the 2003 Award, in which her name was given as Minnie Motorcar Apwerl (Pwerle). The artist's asking price for the picture, A$44,000, was the second-highest in the exhibition and the highest for an artist from the central and western deserts. Her painting Awelye Atnwengerrp 2 was exhibited in the 2005 competition.|$|E

There, she was involved in the development of flight training curricula for broad use throughout the Navy. Naval officials <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> kidnapping case to be resolved before taking further action against her. Military law experts state that while the Navy rarely brings charges against officers for adultery, it is seen as conduct unbecoming an officer, as it demonstrates bad judgment.|$|E

25|$|She dressed {{the female}} corpse {{in her old}} clothing, and removed her false teeth, placing these beside the {{headless}} corpse to have it identified as Belle Gunness. She torched the house and fled. Lamphere had helped her, he admitted, but she had not left by the road where he <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> after the fire had been set. In the end, she had betrayed him, cutting across open fields and disappearing into the woods. Some accounts suggest that Lamphere admitted that {{he took her to}} Stillwell (a town about nine miles from La Porte) and saw her off on a train to Chicago.|$|E
25|$|On Saturday night, April 13, Betty Jo Booker, age 15, {{was playing}} her alto {{saxophone}} in her regular weekly gig with her band, The Rythmaires, at the VFW Club at W. 4th and Oak Street. She did not finish until about 1:30a.m. Sunday. She <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> friend since kindergarten, Paul Martin, age 16, {{to pick her}} up. Martin was in town after moving away to Kilgore two years prior. He had been with her earlier that day before the dance and was {{to take her to}} a slumber party across town. Booker's classmates said that earlier that day she told them that {{she did not want to}} go out with Martin but felt obligated since he was an old friend.|$|E
25|$|Bachué: {{the mother}} of the Muisca people. It was said that a {{beautiful}} woman with a baby came out of Lake Iguaque. Bachué sat down at the bank of the lake and <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> son to grow up. When he was old enough, they married and had many children, who were the Muisca. Bachué taught them to hunt, to farm, to respect the laws, and to worship the gods. Bachué was so good and loved that the Muisca referred to her as Furachoque (Good woman in Chibcha). When they became old, Bachué and her son and husband {{decided to go back to}} the deep of the lagoon. That day the Muisca were so sad, but at the same time very happy because they knew their mother was very happy. Other versions of the legend say that after stepping into the lagoon of Iguaque, Bachué ascended to the sky and became Chía; in other versions Chia and Bachué are two different figures.|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{had last}} toured in Australia in 1993 with The Girlie Show World Tour, her fourth concert tour. The country was skipped {{for the next}} five tours until the singer {{released}} her thirteenth studio album, Rebel Heart (2015). To promote the album, Madonna announced the Rebel Heart Tour, and confirmed that she would be coming to Australia with the concert, as well as visit New Zealand for the first time. Before arriving in Australia, Madonna announced an extra show on March 10, 2016, at Melbourne's Forum Theatre. The show was billed as an intimate gig, and was described by the singer as a fusion of music, art and comedy. It was titled as Madonna: Tears of a Clown show and was created for the singer's Australian fans, who had <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to perform there for the last 23 years. During her promotional appearance at The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in April 2015, Madonna confessed that she is a [...] "kind of closet comedian" [...] and did a skit on the show; she added, [...] "I always do extravaganzas, they always cost a billion dollars to make ... nobody makes any money ... and sometimes I dream about simplicity." [...] During the show, the singer explained her decision to do Tears of a Clown: ...|$|E
2500|$|In September, {{she left}} for Italy with her entourage of 255 persons and 247 horses. The pope's messenger, the {{librarian}} Lucas Holstenius, himself a convert, <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> in Innsbruck. [...] On 3 November 1655, Christina announced her conversion to Roman Catholicism in the Hofkirche and wrote to Pope Alexander VII and her cousin Charles X about it. To celebrate her official conversion, L'Argia, an opera by Antonio Cesti, was performed. Ferdinand Charles, Archduke of Austria, already in financial trouble, {{is said to have}} been almost ruined by her visit. Her departure was on 8 November.|$|E
2500|$|After the war, when Moses {{sought to}} return to Egypt – Tharbis {{is said to have}} {{resisted}} and insisted that he remain in Ethiopia as her husband. He then, being [...] "most skilful in astronomy", cast two rings; one which caused the wearer to become forgetful, and the other to cause the wearer to remember all. He gave the first ring to Tharbis, and wore the second himself, and <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> oblivious nature to lose interest in retaining him as a husband – and when she had forgotten her love for him, he returned to Egypt alone. Some have suggested this period may have started when Moses was 27, and that he remained with Tharbis for forty years; although this number contradicts the traditional sources which suggest that Moses killed an Egyptian overseer when he was approximately 40 years old himself.|$|E

2500|$|In 1930, Davis {{moved to}} Hollywood to screen test for Universal Studios. Davis {{and her mother}} {{traveled}} by train to Hollywood and arrived on December 13, 1930. She later recounted her surprise that nobody from the studio was there to meet her at the train. [...] In fact, a studio employee had <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> but left because he saw nobody who [...] "looked like an actress". She failed her first screen test, but was used in several screen tests for other actors. In a 1971 interview with Dick Cavett, she related the experience with the observation, [...] "I was the most Yankee-est, most modest virgin who ever walked the earth. They laid me on a couch, and I tested fifteen men...They all had to lie {{on top of me}} and give me a passionate kiss. Oh, I thought I would die. Just thought I would die." [...] A second test was arranged for Davis, for the 1931 film A House Divided. Hastily dressed in an ill-fitting costume with a low neckline, she was rebuffed by the director William Wyler, who loudly commented to the assembled crew, [...] "What do you think of these dames who show their chests and think they can get jobs?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The name of {{the island}} of Flores has been made {{familiar}} to generations of English readers by the quotation: [...] "At Flores in the Azores Sir Richard Grenville lay...", which is the opening line of Alfred, Lord Tennyson's epic poem, [...] "The Revenge, A Ballad of the Fleet". [...] On 9 September 1591, a small English fleet of six ships under Lord Thomas Howard was anchored in the bay of Ribeira da Cruz in Flores, and was surprised by 53 ships under Alfonso de Bazán. The English ships {{were part of a}} naval patrol intended to intercept Spanish ships from the Americas and were under repair and re-provisioning when the Spanish ships appeared. Five of the English ships slipped out to sea to the west of Corvo, but the Revenge (under Sir Richard Grenville) <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> sick crew, many of whom had an epidemic of fever, to be returned from the shore, then decided to go straight through the approaching Spanish lines from the east. Revenge fought the Spanish ships for fifteen hours, resisting multiple attempts to board her. Her fatally wounded captain eventually ordered her to be scuttled, ("Sink me the ship, Master Gunner — sink her, split her in twain! / Fall into the hands of God, not into the hands of Spain!") but her crew instead negotiated an honourable surrender. ("And the stately Spanish men to their flagship bore him then,/ Where they laid him by the mast, old Sir Richard caught at last,/ And they praised him to his face with their courtly foreign grace..."). The [...] "Battle of Flores" [...] as it was known culminated in the death of Grenville two days later and the Revenge became the only English ship to be captured during the Elizabethan conflict. [...] But the ship never reached Spain; it foundered during a storm near Terceira and went down with 200 Spaniards, along with several other Spanish ships.|$|E
