MLGL owners Ballard and Stafford Smythe <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five founding partners of the club, but financial difficulties forced MLGL to take over ownership midway though the season. The NLA suspended operations prior to the following season.|$|E
5|$|After having {{problems}} with drugs and alcohol, drummer Phil Rudd's friendship with Malcolm Young deteriorated and eventually escalated to a physical confrontation after which Rudd was fired. Former Procol Harum drummer B.J. Wilson was drafted in to help complete the recordings, but his drum parts were eventually not used, as Rudd had already completed his drum parts. Rudd was replaced by Simon Wright {{in the summer of}} 1983 after the band held over 700 auditions in the US and UK. Simon Kirke of Free and Bad Company fame, and Paul Thompson of Roxy Music <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drummers auditioned.|$|E

5|$|After {{midnight on}} 29 April, with the Soviets {{advancing}} {{ever closer to}} the bunker complex, Hitler married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony within the Führerbunker. Afterwards, Hitler hosted a modest wedding breakfast with his new wife. Hitler then took secretary Traudl Junge to another room and dictated his last will and testament.

5|$|Coming {{into the}} game, Arizona and Nevada <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> top offenses in the country, ranking 7th and 10th in {{yards per game}} respectively. There was also {{significant}} hype surrounding the game because it featured {{two of the best}} running backs in the country, Ka'Deem Carey for Arizona, and Stefphon Jefferson for Nevada. Carey was ranked number one in the country in total rushing yards, while Jefferson was ranked number two. The duo were also prolific scorers; Jefferson was second in the country in rushing touchdowns with 25 and Carey was third with 24. The game was widely expected to be a shoot-out, as both teams were in the top-20 scoring offenses in the regular season.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, the Prime Minister's {{own party}} was {{breaking}} down underneath him. There {{had been no}} official party platform yet agreed to, and individual members had a wide degree of latitude to determine the issues they ran on, leading to frequent government defections on legislation. The government's existing nine-seat majority shrank during 1928 and 1929 over various issues, {{as a result of}} by-elections, and several leading figures who had previously worked with Bruce became increasingly sharp critics of him. Hughes and Edward Mann <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government's most ardent opponents in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Gen. Howard, {{witnessing}} this disaster, sent forward {{an artillery}} battery and an infantry brigade from von Steinwehr's reserve force, under Col. Charles Coster. Coster's battle line {{just north of}} the town in Kuhn's brickyard was overwhelmed by Hays and Avery. He provided valuable cover for the retreating soldiers, but at a high price: of Coster's 800 men, 313 were captured, as <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four guns from the battery.|$|E
5|$|Having {{between a}} fifth or sixth of the arable or good {{pastoral}} land and {{roughly the same}} amount of coastline as England and Wales, marginal pastoral agriculture and fishing <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important aspects of the Medieval Scottish economy. With poor communications, in the Early Middle Ages most settlements needed to achieve a degree of self-sufficiency in agriculture. Most farms were based around a family unit and used an infield and outfield system. Arable farming grew in the High Middle Ages and agriculture entered a period of relative boom between the thirteenth century and late fifteenth century.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 16th century, the Yucatán Peninsula was still {{dominated}} by the Maya civilization. It was divided {{into a number of}} independent provinces that shared a common culture but varied in their internal sociopolitical organisation. When the Spanish discovered Yucatán, the provinces of Mani and Sotuta <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important polities in the region. They were mutually hostile; the Xiu Maya of Mani allied themselves with the Spanish, while the Cocom Maya of Sotuta became the implacable enemies of the European colonisers.|$|E
5|$|In the highlands, Kaminaljuyu {{emerged as}} a {{principal}} centre in the Late Preclassic. Takalik Abaj and Chocolá <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important cities on the Pacific coastal plain, and Komchen grew to become an important site in northern Yucatán. The Late Preclassic cultural florescence collapsed in the 1st century AD {{and many of the}} great Maya cities of the epoch were abandoned; the cause of this collapse is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Lying {{within the}} county {{boundaries}} of Lancashire, {{until the early}} 19th century, Great Bolton and Little Bolton <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eighteen townships of the ecclesiastical parish of Bolton le Moors. These townships were separated by the River Croal, Little Bolton on the north bank and Great Bolton on the south. Bolton Poor Law Union was formed on 1 February 1837. It continued using existing poorhouses at Fletcher Street and Turton but in 1856 started {{to build a new}} workhouse at Fishpool Farm in Farnworth. Townleys Hospital was built on the site which is now Royal Bolton Hospital.|$|E

5|$|On 1 January 1923 the Great North of Scotland {{became a}} part of the Scottish {{division}} of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), who received a total of 122 locomotives, 100 4-4-0 tender locomotives and 22 tank engines, all capable of being used on either passenger or goods trains. Forty-four locomotives were still in service when the railway was nationalised in 1948, and the last two Great North locomotives to be withdrawn <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aberdeen harbour tanks in 1960. No. 49, Gordon Highlander was restored to Great North green in 1958, although it had not previously carried the green livery as it appeared in Heywood's lined black. It was used on special trains before becoming a static exhibit at the Glasgow Transport Museum in 1965, and is currently on loan to the Scottish Railway Museum at Bo'ness.|$|E
5|$|The {{bishops of}} Olinda and Belém (in {{the provinces of}} Pernambuco and Pará, respectively) <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new {{generation}} of educated, zealous Brazilian clerics. They had {{been influenced by the}} Ultramontanism which spread among Catholics in this period. In 1872 they ordered Freemasons expelled from lay brotherhoods. While European Masonry often tended towards atheism and anti-clericalism, things were much different in Brazil where membership in Masonic orders was common—although PedroII himself was not a Freemason. The government headed by the Viscount of Rio Branco tried on two separate occasions to persuade the bishops to repeal, but they refused. This led to their trial and conviction by the Superior Court of Justice. In 1874 they were sentenced four years at hard labor, although the Emperor commuted this to imprisonment only.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Scotland in the Middle Ages covers {{all forms of}} {{economic}} activity in the modern boundaries of Scotland, between {{the departure of the}} Romans from Northern Britain in the fifth century, until the advent of the Renaissance in the early sixteenth century, including agriculture, crafts and trade.

5|$|The {{warning was}} appropriate, {{for in the}} Congressional elections, Republicans won their biggest {{landslide}} in decades, taking full control of the House, while the Populists lost most of their support. Cleveland's factional enemies gained control of the Democratic Party in state after state, including full control in Illinois and Michigan, and made major gains in Ohio, Indiana, Iowa and other states. Wisconsin and Massachusetts <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few states that remained {{under the control of}} Cleveland's allies. The Democratic opposition were close to controlling two-thirds of the vote at the 1896 national convention, which they needed to nominate their own candidate. They failed for lack of unity and a national leader, as Illinois governor John Peter Altgeld had been born in Germany and was ineligible to be nominated for President.|$|E
5|$|Turkish {{nationalism}} and secularism <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> six founding {{principles of the}} Turkish Republic. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, {{the leader of the}} early decades of the Republic, aimed to create a nation state (Turkish: Ulus) from the Turkish remnants of the Ottoman Empire. During the first three decades of the Republic, efforts to Turkify geographical names were a recurring theme. Imported maps containing references to historical regions such as Armenia, Kurdistan, or Lazistan (the official name of the province of Rize until 1921) were prohibited (as was the case with Der Grosse Weltatlas, a map published in Leipzig).|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{communist}} groups existed in Sarawak, {{the first of}} which, the Sarawak Overseas Chinese Democratic Youth League, formed in 1951. Another group, the North Kalimantan Communist Party (NKCP) (also known as Clandestine Communist Organisation (CCO) by government sources) was formally set up in 1970. Weng Min Chyuan and Bong Kee Chok <b>were</b> <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more notable communist leaders involved in the insurgency. As the political scene changed, it grew progressively {{more difficult for the}} communists to operate. This led to Bong opening talks with chief minister Abdul Rahman Ya'kub in 1973 and eventually signing an agreement with the government. Weng, who had moved to China in the mid-1960s but nonetheless retained control of the CCO, pushed for a continued armed insurrection against the government in spite of this agreement. The conflict continued mostly in the Rajang Delta region but eventually ended when, on 17 October 1990, the NKCP signed a peace agreement with the Sarawak government.|$|E
