5|$|The {{native forest}} in the Canberra region was almost wholly {{eucalypt}} species and provided a resource for fuel and domestic purposes. By the early 1960s, logging had depleted the eucalypt, and concern about water quality led to the forests being closed. Interest in forestry began in 1915 with trials {{of a number of}} species including Pinus radiata on the slopes of Mount Stromlo. Since then, plantations have been expanded, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> of reducing erosion in the Cotter catchment, and the forests are also popular recreation areas.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> of an Aitchison {{travelling}} scholarship {{from the}} University of Melbourne, Massey went to Trinity College, Cambridge to perform {{research at the}} Cavendish Laboratory led by Ernest Rutherford. The scholarship expired after two years, but he was awarded an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship in 1931. At this time the Cavendish Laboratory {{was one of the}} leading centres of physics in the world. In 1932 Cavendish laboratory scientists John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton split the atomic nucleus, James Chadwick discovered the neutron, and Patrick Blackett and Giuseppe Occhialini confirmed the existence of the positron.|$|E

25|$|The {{origins of}} the program date back to 1960, when a Pacific White-sided Dolphin was {{acquired}} for hydrodynamic studies seeking to improve torpedo performance.

This research has now resumed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> of modern-day technology; among the possible drag-reducing mechanisms being studied for human use are skin compliance, biopolymers, and boundary-layer heating.|$|E

25|$|He {{strongly}} opposed the communists that {{had left the}} socialist party in January 1921, and felt certain sympathy for fascism in its initial phase. Like many other intellectuals and politicians of all persuasions, he saw fascism as an extreme defence against the dangers of Bolshevism, but condemned its recourse to violence. In August 1921 he applauded the agreement between socialists and fascists {{to put an end}} to the civil war. His death on 2 September 1921, saved him from, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>benefit</b> of hindsight, an embarrassing adhesion of fascism.|$|E

25|$|Benjamin K.

In August 2011, the Japanese Government passed a bill to subsidize electricity from renewable energy sources.
