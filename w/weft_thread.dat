25|$|At this point, {{the thread}} is woven. Depending on the era, one person could manage {{anywhere}} from 3 to 100 machines. In the mid nineteenth century, four was the standard number. A skilled weaver in 1925 would run 6 Lancashire Looms. As time progressed new mechanisms were added that stopped the loom any time something went wrong. The mechanisms checked {{for such things}} as a broken warp thread, broken <b>weft</b> <b>thread,</b> the shuttle going straight across, and if the shuttle was empty. Forty of these Northrop Looms or automatic looms could be operated by one skilled worker.|$|E
5000|$|In plain weave, {{the warp}} and weft are aligned so they form a simple {{criss-cross}} pattern. Each <b>weft</b> <b>thread</b> crosses the warp threads by going over one, then under the next, and so on. The next <b>weft</b> <b>thread</b> goes under the warp threads that its neighbor went over, and vice versa.|$|E

5000|$|In basketweave, {{groups of}} warp and <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> are {{interlaced}} {{so that they}} form a simple criss-cross pattern. Each group of <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> crosses {{an equal number of}} warp threads by going over one group, then under the next, and so on. The next group of <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> goes under the warp threads that its neighbor went over, and vice versa.|$|R
50|$|Cutwork {{is related}} to drawn thread work. In drawn thread work, {{typically}} only the warp or <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> are withdrawn (cut and removed), and the remaining threads in the resulting hole are bound in various ways. In other types of cutwork, both warp and <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> may be drawn.|$|R

50|$|Needle weaving is a drawn thread work {{embroidery}} {{technique that}} involves darning patterns into barelaid warp or <b>weft</b> <b>thread.</b>|$|E
5000|$|There {{are other}} more {{advanced}} techniques in which, instead of merely allowing warp threads to alternate in their {{up or down}} positions, individual threads are brought to the surface to form {{what is called a}} [...] "pick up" [...] pattern. One side of the band will show the exposed surfaces of warp threads while, {{on the other side of}} the pattern, the <b>weft</b> <b>thread</b> will be visible. Using a supplemental <b>weft</b> <b>thread</b> that will come up over the top of certain warp threads, brocaded designs can also be worked into the inkle band.|$|E

50|$|Picks per inch/Inch (or p.p.i.) is {{the number}} of weft threads per inch of woven fabric. A pick is a single <b>weft</b> <b>thread,</b> hence the term. In general, the higher the picks per inch, the finer the fabric is.|$|E
5000|$|Cloth of gold {{is not to}} be {{confused}} with various gold embroidery techniques that date to the early Middle Ages, though the type of goldwork thread called [...] "passing" [...] is identical to the <b>weft</b> <b>thread</b> of cloth of gold.|$|E
50|$|Airjet weaving is {{one type}} of shuttle-less weaving. In the technique, a fine jet of air is used to propel the <b>weft</b> <b>thread</b> into the warp shed. The {{machinery}} used in airjet weaving consists of a main nozzle, auxiliary nozzles or relay nozzles, and a profile reed.|$|E
5000|$|The bias {{grain of}} a piece of woven fabric, usually {{referred}} to simply as [...] "the bias", is at 45 degrees to its warp and <b>weft</b> <b>threads.</b> Every piece of woven fabric has two biases, perpendicular to each other. A garment made of woven fabric is said to be [...] "cut on the bias" [...] when the fabric's warp and <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> are at 45 degrees to its major seam lines.|$|R

50|$|When weaving on a loom, {{the beads}} {{are locked in}} between the warp threads by the weft threads. The most common bead weaving {{technique}} requires two passes of the <b>weft</b> <b>thread.</b> First, an entire row of beads is strung on the <b>weft</b> <b>thread.</b> Then the beads are pressed in between the warp threads. The needle is passed back through the beads above the warp threads to lock the beads into place. Heddle looms were popular {{near the beginning of}} the 20th century. They allowed weaving of beads by raising every other thread and inserting strung beads in the shed, the space between the lowered and raised threads. There are still a few Heddle Bead Looms being manufactured today. The most difficult part of loomwork is finishing off the warp threads.|$|E
50|$|Mono canvas {{comes in}} the widest variety of colors (especially 18 mesh) and is plain woven, with one <b>weft</b> <b>thread</b> going over and under one warp thread. This canvas has the most {{possibilities}} for manipulation and open canvas. It is used for hand-painted canvases as well as counted thread canvaswork.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} weaving can be {{simplified}} {{to a series}} of four steps: the shed is raised, the shuttle is passed through, the shed is closed, and the <b>weft</b> <b>thread</b> is beaten into place. These steps are then repeated, with a different set of threads being raised so as to interlace the warp and weft.|$|E
40|$|Classical (or biaxial) twill is {{a textile}} weave {{in which the}} <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> pass over and under two or more warp threads, with an offset between {{adjacent}} <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> to give an appearance of diagonal lines. This paper introduces a theoretical framework for constructing twill-woven objects, i. e., cyclic twill-weavings on arbitrary surfaces, and it provides methods to convert polygonal meshes into twill-woven objects. It also develops a general technique to obtain exact triaxial-woven objects from an arbitrary polygonal mesh surface. 1...|$|R

5000|$|The Ikat {{technique}} (also called [...] "chong kiet" [...] in Khmer) {{is one of}} {{the most}} ancient weaving techniques in the world and is used to create designs in fabrics. Artisans create a tight knot resistant to dyes which forms an original pattern with the complex intertwining of the warp thread and the <b>weft</b> <b>thread.</b>|$|E
5000|$|With each weaving operation, {{the newly}} {{constructed}} fabric must be wound on a cloth beam. This process is called taking up. At the same time, the warp yarns must be let off or {{released from the}} warp beams. To become fully automatic, a loom needs a filling stop motion which will brake the loom, if the <b>weft</b> <b>thread</b> breaks.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of tulle is actually bobbinet, invented in Britain {{in the early}} 19th century. Bobbinet is made by wrapping the <b>weft</b> <b>thread</b> around the warp thread, creating a strong hexagonal design which tends not to twist or fall out of shape, because the wrapped threads maintain a state of tension. The result is tulle netting which is lightweight and surprisingly strong and durable for its weight.|$|E
5000|$|Shedding [...] - [...] {{dividing}} the warp sheet or shed into two layers, one above {{the other for}} the passage of shuttle with the <b>weft</b> <b>threads.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Interlocking method - two wefts are {{interlocked}} {{with each other}} where the colour change is required. The figuring weft is made {{of a number of}} coloured threads, weaving plain with warp threads and interlocked on either side with the grounds <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> are invariably gold threads which interlock with the figure <b>weft</b> <b>threads,</b> thus forming the figure. This system of interlocking weaves, known as kadiyal, is done so that there are no extra floats {{on the back of the}} motif thus making the design nearly reversible.|$|R
50|$|Tapestry {{is a form}} of textile art, {{traditionally}} woven on {{a vertical}} loom. Tapestry is weft-faced weaving, in which all the warp threads are hidden in the completed work, unlike cloth weaving where both the warp and the <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> may be visible. In tapestry weaving, weft yarns are typically discontinuous; the artisan interlaces each coloured weft back and forth in its own small pattern area. It is a plain weft-faced weave having <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> of different colours worked over portions of the warp to form the design.|$|R
50|$|Alternating sets of threads are lifted by {{connecting}} them with string or wires called heddles to another bar, called the shaft (or heddle bar or heald). Heddles, shafts and the couper (lever {{to lift the}} assembly) are called the harness â€” the harness provides for mechanical operation using foot- or hand-operated treadles.After passing a <b>weft</b> <b>thread</b> through the warp, a reed comb is used to beat (compact) the woven weft.|$|E
50|$|In general, weaving {{involves}} using a loom {{to interlace}} {{two sets of}} threads {{at right angles to}} each other: the warp which runs longitudinally and the weft (older woof) that crosses it. One warp thread is called an end and one <b>weft</b> <b>thread</b> is called a pick. The warp threads are held taut and in parallel to each other, typically in a loom. There are many types of looms.|$|E
5000|$|Patterns {{result from}} a {{combination}} of the warp dye and the <b>weft</b> <b>thread</b> colour. Some warp ikat traditions are designed with vertical-axis symmetry or have a [...] "mirror-image" [...] running along their long centre line. That is, whatever pattern or design is woven on the right is duplicated on the left in reverse order about a central warp thread group. Patterns can be created in the vertical, horizontal or diagonal.|$|E
50|$|Most weavers use {{a natural}} warp thread, such as linen or cotton. The <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> are usually wool or cotton, but may include silk, gold, silver, or other alternatives.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Soumak weave wraps the <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> over 4 warps {{and back}} over 2. The weaver may sometimes, as here, go {{backwards}} and forwards, reversing {{the direction of}} the wrapping.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{structural}} <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> alternate with supplementary weft {{that rises}} {{from the surface of}} the weave at a perpendicular angle. This supplementary weft is attached to the warp by one of three knots...to form the pile or nap of the carpet." [...] Knots are tied in rows, one to each pair of warp threads, which may then be pushed down to make the rug more solid: [...] "the interwoven warp and <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> form the carpet's foundation, and the design comes from the rows of knots." [...] "In the knotted-pile...the arrangement of rows of weft is the dominant consideration." ...|$|R
