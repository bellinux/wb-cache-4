30|$|The overall TS of the OSB after {{completed}} cycle {{was approximately}} 15  % and about 9  % of {{that did not}} recover which <b>we</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> irrecoverable TS. When OSB was exposed to a wet state in the first cycle, TS was about 9  % and when OSB continued to a dry state, only 6  % of its swelling recovered, which <b>we</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> recoverable TS. Notably, 3  % was irrecoverable TS. The TS from the 20 th cycle {{to the end of}} the cycles was quite similar. This indicates that the amount of irrecoverable TS increased from the first cycle up to 20 cycles but that the amount of recoverable TS in each subsequent cycle did not increase. Unlike OSB, the overall TS for the PW panel was about 3  % and the PW panel almost retained its initial thickness when it was exposed to a dry state in subsequent cycle. Even at the end of cycle, the treatment resulted in almost 3  % TS value for PW. The amplitude of recoverable TS is almost same with advancing cycles in PW. As a result, we found that a wet–dry cycle treatment is not adequate for assessing the degradation of PW.|$|E
