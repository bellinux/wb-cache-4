25|$|For <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> {{that the}} most {{excellent}} man should rule, i.e., the supreme by nature, and that the law rules and alone is authoritative; but the law {{is a kind of}} intelligence, i.e. a discourse based on intelligence. And again, what standard do we have, what criterion of good things, that is more precise than the intelligent man? For all that this man will choose, if the choice is based on his knowledge, are good things and their contraries are bad. And since everybody chooses most of all what conforms to their own proper dispositions (a just man choosing to live justly, a man with bravery to live bravely, likewise a self-controlled man to live with self-control), {{it is clear that the}} intelligent man will choose most of all to be intelligent; for this is the function of that capacity. Hence it's evident that, according to the most authoritative judgment, intelligence is supreme among goods.|$|E
500|$|Nolan's work explores existential, {{ethical and}} {{epistemological}} themes such as subjective experience, distortion of memory, human morality, {{the nature of}} time, causality and construction of personal identity. [...] "I'm fascinated by our subjective perception of reality, {{that we are all}} stuck in a very singular point of view, a singular perspective on what <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> to be an objective reality, and movies are one {{of the ways in which}} we try to see things from the same point of view". Film critic Tom Shone described Nolan's oeuvre as [...] "epistemological thrillers whose protagonists, gripped by the desire for definitive answers, must negotiate mazy environments in which the truth is always beyond their reach." [...] In an essay titled The rational wonders of Christopher Nolan, film critic Mike D'Angelo argues that the filmmaker is a materialist dedicated to exploring the wonders of the natural world. [...] "Underlying nearly every film he's ever made, no matter how fanciful, is his conviction that the universe can be explained entirely by physical processes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Comedian Stephen Colbert has parodied or {{referenced}} Wikipedia {{on numerous}} episodes of his show The Colbert Report and coined the related term wikiality, meaning [...] "together {{we can create}} a reality that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> on—the reality we just agreed on". Another example {{can be found in}} [...] "Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years of American Independence", a July 2006 front-page article in The Onion, as well as the 2010 The Onion article [...] "'L.A.

There is Lebanese consensus on this...we thank God that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> on one clear and definite result; namely, that we reject the resettlement of the Palestinians in Lebanon." [...] There is broad consensus in Lebanon against the permanent resettlement of Palestinians, due to fears that it could reignite Lebanon's civil war. Likewise, Palestinian refugees in Lebanon consistently favor right of return over Lebanese naturalization.|$|E
2500|$|Negative {{scores are}} common, and {{occasionally}} even the victor's score may be negative. Score totals are {{announced at the}} conclusion of the show. Fry has said, [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> that nobody in this universe understands QI's scoring system." [...] John Lloyd, QIs creator, has, on one occasion, admitted that not even he has any idea how the scoring system works, but there is someone who is paid to check on the scores. According to the Series A DVD, guests are allowed the right of appeal if they believe their score is wrong, but none has so far exercised that right.|$|E

2500|$|Colbert made {{repeated}} references on {{the show}} to Wikipedia, which he referred to as his favorite website, generally in [...] "The Wørd" [...] segment. Colbert's first reference to Wikipedia was during the July 31, 2006 broadcast, when [...] "The Word" [...] was Wikiality, defined as the concept that [...] "together we can create a reality that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> on—the reality we just agreed on". The premise of wikiality is that reality is what the wiki says it is. He explained that on Wikipedia [...] "any user can change any entry, and if enough users agree with them, it becomes true". He also told his viewers to edit the Wikipedia article on elephants to edit say: [...] "Elephant population in Africa has tripled {{over the past six}} months." [...] The suggestion resulted in numerous changes to Wikipedia articles related to elephants and Africa. Editing of the articles concerned was restricted to prevent further edits. The pages' protection expiration date has been postponed several times as the vandalism ensued again.|$|E
2500|$|Lithuania fought point-for-point {{through two}} quarters; however, after half-time Team USA scored 10–0 and {{after winning the}} third quarter 33–14, leaving no chances for the Lithuanian team to come back. They {{ultimately}} lost the game 68–96. It {{was one of the}} worst performances for Lithuania against Team USA, following the 51-point defeat in the 1992 Olympics versus the so-called [...] "Dream Team". After the match, coach Jonas Kazlauskas criticized the refereeing: [...] "It just shows what respect every team has. When I asked the referee about the (technical) foul call, he said that he warned the bench not to jump, when Team USA bench was jumping and discussing with the referees just in the same way. Overall, the judging was hardly understandable until Team USA had 20 points lead. Later there was no point in discussing with the referees anymore". Longtime Lithuanian national team games broadcast commentator Robertas Petrauskas ironically described the judging live by saying: [...] "When we discuss the judging against Team USA with the journalists from other countries, <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> that if the referees would call the turnover every time USA player steps before bumping the ball, Team USA would be the most frequent fallible team in the tournament". During the bronze medal game Lithuania faced France, just 2 years removed from the EuroBasket defeat. A terrific battle where youngsters Jonas Valančiūnas and Adas Juškevičius tried to give a win with 39 points combined ensued, but the French still beat them 95–93. Despite not winning any medals, the team was received by thousands of Lithuanians at Rotušės square who wanted to thank the national team for their efforts. According to research, over 2,223 million people observed the national team games live in Lithuania, which is over 76% of the country's population.|$|E
2500|$|Death is {{inevitable}} and temporally unpredictable. Kierkegaard believed that individuals needed to sincerely and intensely come to realize the truth of that fact {{in order to live}} passionately. Kierkegaard accuses society of being in death-denial. Even though people see death all around them and grasp as an objective fact that everyone dies, few people truly understand, subjectively and inwardly, that they will die someday. For example, in Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Kierkegaard notes that people never think to say, [...] "I shall certainly attend your party, but I must make an exception for the contingency that a roof tile happens to blow down and kill me; for in that case, I cannot attend." [...] This is jest as far as Kierkegaard is concerned. But there is also earnestness involved in the thought of death. Kierkegaard said the following about death in his Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1844. [...] We shall not decide which life fights the good fight most easily, but <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>agree</b> that every human being ought to fight the good fight, from which no one is shut out, and yet this is so glorious that if it were granted only once to a past generation under exceptional circumstances-yes, what a description envy and discouragement would then know how to give! The difference is about the same as that in connection with the thought of death. As soon as a human being is born, he begins to die. But the difference is that there are some people for whom the thought of death comes into existence with birth and is present to them in the quiet peacefulness of childhood and the buoyancy of youth; whereas others have a period in which this thought is not present to them until, when the years run out, the years of vigor and vitality, the thought of death meets them on their way. Who, now, is going to decide which life was easier, whether it was the [...] life of those who continually lived with a certain reserve because the thought of death was present to them or the life of those who so abandoned themselves to life that they almost forgot the existence of death? ...|$|E
