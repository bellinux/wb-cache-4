For his entire house was filled with pious persons and was a church of God.|$|E
25|$|I don't hate Islam. I {{consider}} it a backward culture. I have travelled much in the world. And wherever Islam rules, it's just terrible. All the hypocrisy. It's a bit like those old Reformed Protestants. The Reformed lie all the time. And why is that? Because they have standards and values that are so high that you can't humanly maintain them. You also see that in that Muslim culture. Then look at the Netherlands. In what country could an electoral leader of such a large movement as mine be openly homosexual? How <b>wonderful</b> <b>that</b> that's possible. That's something that one can be proud of. And I'd like {{to keep it that}} way, thank you very much.|$|E

500|$|Screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, who {{had worked}} on the two {{previous}} Transformers films, declined to return for the third film, with Kurtzman declaring that [...] "the franchise is so <b>wonderful</b> <b>that</b> it deserves to be fresh, all the time. We just felt like we'd given it a lot and didn't have an insight for where {{to go with it}} next". Revenge of the Fallens co-writer Ehren Kruger became the sole screenwriter for Dark of the Moon. Kruger had frequent meetings with Industrial Light & Magic's (ILM) visual effects producers, who suggested plot points such as the scenes in Chernobyl.|$|E
500|$|Hedwig and Margarete both {{remained}} {{loyal to}} Himmler. Writing to Gebhard in February 1945, Margarete said, [...] "How <b>wonderful</b> <b>that</b> {{he has been}} called to great tasks and is equal to them. The whole of Germany is looking to him." [...] Hedwig expressed similar sentiments {{in a letter to}} Himmler in January. Margarete and Gudrun left Gmund as Allied troops advanced into the area. They were arrested by American troops in Bolzano, Italy, and held in various internment camps in Italy, France, and Germany. They were brought to Nuremberg to testify at the trials and were released in November 1946. Gudrun emerged from the experience embittered by her alleged mistreatment and has remained devoted to her father's memory.|$|E

[...] Storr also stated the episode is an [...] "absolute must watch for anyone who has ever been a fan. For those who aren't, now is a good time to start." [...] Whilst also reviewing the second episode, as both episodes are considered a two-parter, Greg O'Keefe of the Liverpool Echo stated it was [...] "packed with great action sequences, razor-sharp writing and the usual quota of twists and turns. We were also treated to some excellent scenes, shot in Moscow, as the pesky Russians were established as the villains of the series." [...] John Beresford of TV Scoop stated that although he found [...] "two dodgy moments" [...] in the episode, it [...] "didn't mar what was otherwise an excellent opener to the new series." ...|$|E

500|$|Early press {{coverage}} was [...] "mixed", generally {{a combination of}} [...] "embarrassment and puzzlement". The historical novelist and poet Maurice Hewlett published {{a series of articles}} in the literary journal John O' London's Weekly, in which he concluded: [...] "And knowing children, and knowing that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has legs, I decide that the Miss Carpenters have pulled one of them." [...] The Sydney newspaper Truth on 5 January 1921 expressed a similar view; [...] "For the true explanation of these fairy photographs what is wanted is not a knowledge of occult phenomena but a knowledge of children." [...] Some public figures were more sympathetic. Margaret McMillan, the educational and social reformer, wrote: [...] "How <b>wonderful</b> <b>that</b> to these dear children such a wonderful gift has been vouchsafed." [...] The novelist Henry De Vere Stacpoole decided to take the fairy photographs and the girls at face value. In a letter to Gardner he wrote: [...] "Look at Alice's [...] face. Look at Iris's [...] face. There is an extraordinary thing called Truth which has 10million faces and forms– it is God's currency and the cleverest coiner or forger can't imitate it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Foremost of Sargent's detractors was the {{influential}} English art critic Roger Fry, of the Bloomsbury Group, {{who at the}} 1926 Sargent retrospective in London dismissed Sargent's work as lacking aesthetic quality: [...] "Wonderful indeed, but most <b>wonderful</b> <b>that</b> this wonderful performance should ever have been confused with that of an artist." [...] And, in the 1930s, Lewis Mumford led a chorus of the severest critics: [...] "Sargent remained to the end an illustrator ... the most adroit appearance of workmanship, the most dashing eye for effect, cannot conceal the essential emptiness of Sargent's mind, or the contemptuous and cynical superficiality of a certain part of his execution." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{final score}} was 12–0.

The Michigan play both individually and in team work was magnificent. Even the worried Chicago substitutes and coaches on the side line could not refrain from an occasional word of admiration at the perfect defense of the visitors. The very appearance of the team was enough to bring applause from the most prejudiced Chicago supporter. ... he local team appeared like school-boys before them.

2500|$|Dawkins now {{interviews}} Satish Kumar about ideas such as 'treeness' and 'rockness'. Dawkins {{points out}} that it is all evidence-free assertion. He responds to the [...] "science is bleak" [...] argument by saying that the world is so <b>wonderful</b> <b>that</b> the word 'mundane' has a mismatched meaning and etymology. He then complains about the long-term fall in the number of students taking chemistry and physics at A-level. He suggests this is partly because of the UK education system encouraging students to value personal feeling over evidence and reason. He interviews the relativist Steve Fuller and criticises him for being [...] "so close to being right but ... damn wrong". Fuller {{points out that}} different people can interpret the same evidence differently. Fuller also points out the benefits of the Internet, and Dawkins agrees, but then turns to the dangers it poses in causing the spread of fabricated statements. He also points {{to the fact that the}} MMR vaccine scandal involved an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory about the UK government. Dawkins concludes that reason [...] "built the modern world. It is a precious but fragile thing".|$|E
2500|$|The British Army drew {{many of its}} raw {{recruits}} {{from the}} lowest classes of Britain. Since army life {{was known to be}} harsh, and the remuneration low, it attracted mainly those for whom civilian life was worse. The Duke of Wellington himself said that many of the men [...] "enlist from having got bastard children – some for minor offences – some for drink". They were, he once said, [...] "the scum of the earth; it is really <b>wonderful</b> <b>that</b> we should have made them to the fine fellows they are." [...] In Scotland however, a number of men enlisted due to the collapse of the weaving trade and came from skilled artisan or even middle-class households. Most soldiers at the time signed on for life in exchange for a [...] "bounty" [...] of £2317s6d, a lot of which was absorbed by the cost of outfitting [...] "necessities", but a system of 'limited service' (seven years for infantry, ten for cavalry and artillery) was introduced in 1806 to attract recruits. Soldiers began, from 1800 onward, to receive a daily Beer money allowance in addition to their regular wages; the practice was started on the orders of the Duke of York. Additionally, corporal punishment was removed for a large number of petty offences (while it was still retained for serious derelictions of duty) and the Shorncliffe System for light infantry was established in 1803, teaching skirmishing, self-reliance and initiative. Unlike other armies of the time, the British did not use conscription to bolster army numbers, with enlistment remaining voluntary.|$|E
