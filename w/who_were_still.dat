5|$|At {{the age of}} 42, in {{his last}} {{substantial}} major league season, Henderson finished the year with 25 stolen bases, ninth in the NL; it also marked his 23rd consecutive season with more than 20 steals. Of the ten top base stealers <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> active as of 2002, the other nine each stole fewer bases in 2002 than the 42-year-old Henderson.|$|E
5|$|During the lull {{both sides}} made changes to their dispositions. The 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division {{relieved}} the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division {{in the west}} of the British salient, while the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division relieved the infantry of the 11th Armoured Division <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> holding the Odon bridgehead. The Germans moved up the 277th Infantry Division which began to relieve the 9th SS Panzer Division and the battle group of the 2nd SS Panzer Division.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, the Japanese Economic Stabilization Agency {{calculated}} that the Allied naval bombardments {{and other forms of}} attack other than bombing had caused 3,282 casualties, representing 0.5 percent of all casualties inflicted by the Allies in the Japanese home islands. The casualties attributed to naval bombardments and other causes included 1,739 fatalities, 46 persons <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> classified as missing and 1,497 people who were wounded.|$|E
5|$|Philip was {{now able}} {{to turn to the}} Illyrians, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> occupying much of upper Macedon (whether agreed by treaty or not). He held an {{assembly}} of the army, gathered together a force of 10,000 men and 600 cavalry and marched into Illyria. Bardylis, hearing of the preparations, sent ambassadors to Philip, proposing peace {{on the basis of the}} status quo. Philip rejected this, insisting that the Illyrians must withdraw completely from Macedonia, so Bardylis instead prepared for battle, raising 10,000 men and 500 cavalry, according to Diodorus.|$|E
5|$|Several {{days later}} the NZMRB {{was moved to the}} south to support the 2nd Light Horse Brigade at Ziza. The light-horsemen had taken the {{surrender}} of a large Turkish force, part of the Turkish Fourth Army, then had to defend them from the Arab tribesmen. When the brigade arrived the Australian and Turkish troops, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> armed, were holding a perimeter facing the Arab force. The brigade's appearance resolved the situation and the Turkish troops surrendered.|$|E

5|$|The assassins, the {{key members}} of the clandestine network, and the key Serbian {{military}} conspirators <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> alive were arrested, tried, convicted and punished. Those who were arrested in Bosnia were tried in Sarajevo in October 1914. The other conspirators were arrested and tried before a Serbian court on the French-controlled Salonika Front in 1916–1917 on unrelated false charges; Serbia executed three of the top military conspirators. Much of what is known about the assassinations comes from these two trials and related records.|$|E
5|$|By the 1570s, an {{underground}} church was growing {{fast as the}} Church of England became more Protestant and less bearable for Roman Catholics <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> a sizeable minority. Only one public attempt to restore the old religion occurred: the Rising of the Northern earls in 1569. It was a botched attempt; in spite of tumultuous crowds who greeted the rebels in Durham, the rebellion did not spread. The assistance they sought did not materialise, their communication with allies at Court was poor. They came nowhere near to freeing Mary Stuart, whose presence might have rallied support, from her imprisonment in Tutbury.|$|E
5|$|During the siege, {{newly elected}} delegates from across Texas {{met at the}} Convention of 1836. On March 2, the delegates {{declared}} independence, forming the Republic of Texas. Four days later, the delegates at the convention received a dispatch Travis had written March 3 warning of his dire situation. Unaware that the Alamo had fallen, Robert Potter called for the convention to adjourn and march immediately to relieve the Alamo. Sam Houston convinced the delegates to remain in Washington-on-the-Brazos to develop a constitution. After being appointed sole commander of all Texian troops, Houston journeyed to Gonzales to take command of the 400volunteers <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> waiting for Fannin to lead them to the Alamo.|$|E

5|$|Over time, {{professional}} play {{became increasingly}} common, {{and with it}} came rising salaries and unpredictable player movement, {{as well as the}} illegal payment of college players <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> in school. The National Football League (NFL), a group of professional teams that was originally established in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association, aimed to solve these problems. This new league's stated goals included an end to bidding wars over players, prevention of the use of college players, and abolition of the practice of paying players to leave another team. By 1922, the NFL had established itself as the premier professional football league.|$|E
5|$|The American {{prisoners were}} quickly {{returned}} to the United States, most by plane. Those <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> sick or weakened remained at American hospitals to continue to recuperate. On February11, 1945, 280 POWs left Leyte aboard the transport USS General A.E. Anderson bound for San Francisco via Hollandia, New Guinea. In an effort to counter the improved American morale, Japanese propaganda radio announcers broadcast to American soldiers that submarines, ships, and planes were hunting the General Anderson. The threats {{proved to be a}} bluff, and the ship safely arrived in San Francisco Bay on March8, 1945.|$|E
5|$|The Cabildo {{accepted}} the document {{and moved to}} the balcony to submit it directly to the people for ratification. But, because of the late hour and the weather, {{the number of people in}} the plaza had declined. Leiva ridiculed the claim of the remaining representatives to speak on behalf of the people. This wore the patience of the few <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> in the plaza in the rain. Beruti did not accept any further delays, and threatened to call people to arms. Facing the prospect of further violence, the popular request was read aloud and immediately ratified by those present.|$|E

5|$|The Committee set itself several {{rules and}} over the years {{developed}} many practices. The names had to be euphonious (they had to have a pleasant sound). Also, their meaning had to be readily apparent to anyone interested, whether railwayman or member of the public. There had to be good publicity value in the names as well as providing good morale for the staff, and the collection of names for a class had to provide some form of class identity. Another rule was not to use names of people <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> alive at the time, and some on the Committee had a strong dislike of names or associations with the military (largely because they were fed-up with the recently ended war). There was a preference for names of heroes and other well-known people. However, slavishly following a single theme to an absurd extent was discouraged.|$|E
5|$|While XXXVI Corps was {{struggling}} against the Soviets, III Corps' situation {{was not much}} better, despite reinforcements arriving from the transfers of XXXVI Corps to the south. Group F's new drive on Ukhta was immediately stopped in its tracks by recent reinforcements of the 88th Rifle Division. The Soviets now launched a heavy counterattack. The Finns, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> reorganising with the recently arrived German units for a revived push to the east, were forced to retire. To counter the new threat AOK Norwegen now threw in everything it had available to bolster the Finnish front. New assignments included another regiment from XXXVI Corps as well as parts of the 14th Finnish Infantry Regiment pulled from Operation Platinum Fox, the German front in the far north. The new reinforcements helped to stabilise the front.|$|E
5|$|According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Penda became king in 626, ruled for 30 years, and was 50 {{years old}} at the time of his accession. That he ruled for 30 years should not be taken as an exact figure, since the same source says he died in 655, which would not {{correspond}} to the year given for the beginning of his reign unless he died in the thirtieth year of his reign. Furthermore, that Penda was truly 50 {{years old at}} the beginning of his reign is generally doubted by historians, mainly because of the ages of his children. The idea that Penda, at about 80 years of age, would have left behind children <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> young (his son Wulfhere was still just a youth three years after Penda's death, according to Bede) has been widely considered implausible. The possibility has been suggested that the Chronicle actually meant to say that Penda was 50 {{years old at the}} time of his death, and therefore about 20 in 626.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the same}} time, to the south, Percy {{advanced}} with some 3,000 men. Percy advanced in two columns with his brigade of Hessians {{on the left}} and Percy himself leading the right. About 200 yards from the American lines Percy halted the advance, waiting for the feint by Stirling to take place. Facing Percy was Alexander Graydon and his company. Graydon's superior was Lambert Cadwalader, Magaw's second in command, {{who was in charge of}} holding the three defensive lines south of Fort Washington. After hearing that there was a landing on the shore in his rear, Cadwalader sent 50 men to oppose it. The 50 men ran into the feint by Col. Stirling's 42nd Foot of 700 men. Where Stirling landed happened to be the least defended area of the American defenses, and when Cadwalader heard how many men were there, he sent another 100 men to reinforce the 50 he had sent earlier. The British landing parties spread out, looking for a path through the rough terrain on the landing spot. The Americans took up a position on a hilltop and began firing at the British troops <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> crossing the river, killing or wounding 80 men. The British troops charged the American position, dispersing them.|$|E
5|$|As archbishop, William {{undertook}} {{a number of}} ecclesiastical reforms, and became popular {{with the people of}} York. However, he still needed a pallium, the sign of an archbishop's authority from the pope, which he had not yet received. The Cistercians, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> adamantly opposed to his being archbishop, were determined to prevent his receiving it. William travelled to Rome in an attempt to obtain the pallium. The election of Pope Eugene III, a Cistercian, in 1145, was a setback for his cause. Bernard of Clairvaux, the famous Cistercian abbot and religious leader, exerted all his influence to ensure William's suspension, sending a series of complaints to the new pope that William had been intruded by secular powers into the see, that he was oppressing the Cistercian monasteries and that he had irregularly appointed William of St. Barbara as Dean of York. In the winter of 1145–46 Eugene re-examined the case, declared that William had not been validly consecrated, and suspended him from office. William was required to obtain an in-person refutation of the old charges by William of St. Barbara, who was now the Bishop of Durham.|$|E
5|$|By 10:00, {{all three}} French ships were {{within range of}} Centurion and a heavy {{exchange}} of fire began. Within 15 minutes, both Centurion and Marengo had their colours shot away and at 10:45 the ship of the line turned away for open water, followed by the frigates, her rigging in disarray. Damage had rendered Centurion unable to manoeuvre rapidly and she began slowly limping inshore to shelter from Marengo among the coastal shoals. Captain Lind rejoined his ship by boat, hailing the Princess Charlotte, which had still not participated in the battle, to cut her anchor cables and go ashore to avoid being captured. Logan refused and at 11:15 surrendered without a fight as the whole French squadron moved back towards the harbour. Marengo again remained beyond the sandbars that marked the entrance. The boatloads of sepoys, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> en route to Princess Charlotte, turned about and rowed back to shore to avoid capture. Sémillante took possession of the merchant ship while Marengo and Atalante engaged Centurion, which had moved {{out of range of}} support from the shore batteries.|$|E
