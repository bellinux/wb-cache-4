40|$|AbstractIn {{laser beam}} welding, a serious {{challenge}} is to control the distortion during the process. Understanding the whole process chain in view of different distortion potentials applied in each processing step provides {{the ability to control}} the distortion of the welded components. Every manufacturing step induces residual stresses in the component which can be released by the heat of the welding process, while further residual stresses are introduced into the welded parts upon cooling. The laser beam sources of the new generation permit a high power welding process and high beam quality at the same time. These laser beams are capable of producing deep and narrow seams. Thus the thermal strains of the joined parts are expected to be minimized. Especially axial welded shaft-hub joints show an irregular distribution of bending deformation, which is caused by the self-influencing <b>welding</b> <b>gap.</b> This work deals with the investigation of different laser beam sources and their effect on the welding distortion in axial welded shafthub joints made of steel (20 MnCr 5).

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the shear strength evolution of laser welds. DP 600 steel sheets, with a thin zinc coating, were welded in a lap joint configuration. With the aim of optimisation, {{it has been shown that}} the mechanical set up, i. e. <b>weld</b> <b>gap</b> and clamping force associated with speed and laser power, permit a significant increase in mechanical properties notably in shear strength when the zinc vaporization is optimized. This amelioration required a negative defocusing (− 0. 33 mm) and a minimal <b>weld</b> <b>gap</b> (0. 2 mm) to allow zinc vapour to escape the weld pool and thus avoiding porosity. Equally it has been shown that the shear strength is directly linked to the geometrical properties of the weld bead, particularly at the gap between sheets and principally the control of the zinc vaporization.

The measurement was done with the Neutron Diffraction Method using the Neutron Diffractometer DN 1 -M PSTBM BATAN. A number of 15 points with 45 measurement directions were conducted on the k area in normal, transversal and longitudinal directions. The result of the experiment showed 185 Mpa and 160 Mpa residual stress magnitude in longitudinal and transversal directions in the same directions with the weld toe welding between the web and flange with the extent of the stress area 8 times of the flange thickness. The perpendicular welding of the weld toe resulted in 162 Mpa and 145 Mpa residual stresses in longitudinal and transversal directions with 4 times stress area extent from the flange thickness. The residual stress magnitude and the width of stress area indicated the k area as a vulnerable area to the initial crack occurrence, which may decrease the link performance.

40|$|Process {{parameters}} modeling {{have always}} been one of the key aspects in development of an adaptive control of arc welding process. The welding process parameters are inherently nonlinear, time-delayed, and interdependent, and their on-time adjustment highly influences a sound weld bead formation and process monitoring. During the welding process, parameters control is the primary goal to leads a quality welding. Moreover, the final weld joint behavior, i. e., residual stress, welding strength, and micro-crack formation are generally observed after cooling of the weld product. Thus, it has always been a difficult task to control mechanical properties of a final weld joint. To obtain the best mechanical properties, the final weld joint characteristics needed to be controlled and predicted during the process itself by precise adjustment of the process parameters. The paper presents a neuro-fuzzy modeling approach to provide adaptive control for the automatic process parameter adjustment. Three input parameters wire feed speed, <b>welding</b> <b>gap,</b> and torch speed are modeled with welding current output, providing control over weld bead formation during the welding. The same input process parameters are also modeled to predict final weld joint characteristics, i. e., dilution ratio, hardness of weld bead, hardness of fused zone, and bead width. In order to ascertain the effectiveness of the neuro-fuzzy modeling approach, multiple regression models were also developed to compare the performances. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Londo...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{exploitation}} of high acid wells is facing severe corrosion {{challenges in the}} A and B gas fields in Sichuan, thus using lined steel pipe is a reliable and cost-effective anti-corrosion measure. However, lined steel pipe welding involves dissimilar steel welding, and anti-corrosion performances will be affected if the welding process is unreasonable. So {{it is necessary to}} make evaluation for corrosion of lined steel pipe. In this paper, taking <b>welding</b> <b>gap</b> of L 245 / 825 lined steel pipe as example, the anti-SSC performances of L 245 / 825 straight and ring welding gaps in NACE A solution were studied by CR method, and anti-cracking performances of them were evaluated by laboratory experiments. Then corrosion performances of L 245 / 825 lined steel pipe welding gaps and L 360 NCS carbon steel were studied in the corrosive environment found in the Tian Dong 5 - 1 high sour gas well. Laboratory and field tests show that straight and ring welding gaps of L 245 / 825 lined steel pipe have good anti-environment and anti-cracking performances of electrochemical corrosion in the high acid environment. The technology of welding process selected in the paper is reliable. Research results provide references for welding operation of L 245 / 825 lined steel pipe in high sour gas fields...|$|E

40|$|Monitoring indices SSI, ASI and PR deduced from [99 Ogu] {{were applied}} to CO 2 -Laser-GMA (gas metal arc) Hybrid welding. The indices are {{statistical}} values which come from voltage and current of the arc. The indices serve for as indicators for {{the stability of the}} arc. Therefore the indices are used for quality control of the process. Because of the interaction between laser and arc in the hybrid process, changes of the indices are correlated to changes in the laser power. Process distance and the welding direction may affect the efficiency of laser power as well as the indices. The index SSI at 3 mm process distance and with GMA leading is used for the closed-loop control of the process, because at this process distance and in this welding direction, SSI reacts most sensitively to changes in laser power. A closed-loop control with PID-controller is established. The control interval of 100 ms is optimal. The difference between measured process variable and designed setpoint of SSI determines the actual laser power via PID-controller. The controlled laser power can thus regulate the arc. The controlled laser power in a hybrid process has the following strongponits: fewer short circuits, fewer open circuits, more stable welding voltage, and more stable welding current. The closed-loop control is robust against changes in welding speed. It compensates for changes in the energy input per unit length and reduces laser induced plasma. As for changes in the He-percentage of the shielding gas, the closed-loop control is robust within a certain range. Because of the controlled laser power, plasma is reduced. This closed-loop control is also robust within a certain rage against sudden and gradual changes in the <b>welding</b> <b>gap.</b> The range of the function of the closed-loop control always depends on the value of the setpont.

30|$|To {{investigate}} whether the welding of junctions with a gap is possible without significant {{damage to the}} nanowire, we constructed an experiment. A single nanowire was found connected to an electrode on one side, and with a 400 -nm gap between its other end and the electrode (Fig.  6 c). The nanowire had a silver reservoir attached to the wire region closest to the gap. The first step (voltage sweeps) of the welding procedure was conducted on this nanowire, {{and the result is}} shown in Fig.  6 d. Using defects in the nanowire structure, we can measure the distance between various locations on the nanowire and the bottom electrode in SEM images before and after the procedure. In the after images, it is observed that the points on the nanowire remained the same in relation to the bottom pad. Thus, physical movements such as stretching did not occur. The reservoir, however, expanded enough to close the gap. The local expansion of the reservoir points to local Joule heating as the mechanism by which gap junctions weld. It has been shown that electron discharge in gaps as large as 10  μm is possible with fairly low voltages due to a phenomenon called ion-enhanced field emission [31]. The heat caused by the electrons traversing the gap seems to melt the silver closest to the gap until the weld is complete. If, like in Fig.  6 b, there is not enough silver near the tip of the nanowire to complete the weld, the generated heat causes significant melting and the destabilization of the nanowires. With the nanowire shown in Fig.  6 d, however, the reservoir provided enough material for the gap to be bridged while keeping the nanowire intact. The criteria then for <b>welding</b> <b>gap</b> junctions are that the gaps must be small enough or the nanowires thick enough, so that the melted silver can traverse the gap and initiate contact. The possibility of this kind of weld is in contrast to other types of reported nanowelding, such as nanosintering, where the constituents have to be in contact for welding to take place [32].|$|E
