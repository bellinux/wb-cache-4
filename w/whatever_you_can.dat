He cabled Brigadeführer Edmund Veesenmayer of the SS on 20 July 1944 to ask about it, and was told on 22 July that Brand and Grosz {{had been sent to}} Turkey on the orders of Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS. Eichmann himself said during interrogation after the war that the order had come from Himmler, as did SS officer Kurt Becher: [...] "Himmler said to me: 'Take <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> from the Jews. Promise them whatever you want. What we will keep is another matter.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2007 {{interview}} for Esquire magazine, author and Coltrane biographer Ben Ratliff praised Coltrane's music and balladry, stating [...] "His work contains {{most of the}} well-known ideals of jazz... If you're interested in improvisation, this guy pushed improvisation to the wall. He was the best blues player of his time. He wrote and played incredible ballads. Record companies are still putting out compilations of Coltrane ballads called Coltrane for Lovers or <b>whatever.</b> <b>You</b> <b>can</b> poke fun at the idea, but if you ever listen to one, they're indescribably beautiful." [...] The recordings compiled for Coltrane for Lovers have endured a legacy as one of Coltrane's best performing and interpreting of ballads and standards. In a September 2000 essay on the recordings, writer Al Young elaborated on John Coltrane's ability {{during the period of}} recording the compiled jazz ballads, writing that [...] "The rapport between performer and audience smooths and deepens when a player of John Coltrane's caliber breathes personal expression into some aspect of a song's lyric or meaning." [...] Young continued in his review of the album, stating: ...|$|E

Attending the Forest Home college-age conference were Hal Spencer and his sister, Loretta, son and daughter of Tim Spencer, who was a songwriter and publisher of Christian music. Hal and Loretta borrowed the song sheet from Dr. Orr and brought it home and gave it to their father.|$|E
2500|$|Explaining {{the concept}} of the film, Lopez stated: [...] "There's twists and turns and it's {{exciting}} [...] but it also has a message, which is what attracted me to it in the first place, which is an empowering thing." [...] Describing its message, she said [...] " [...] you're in these negative situations, negative relationships, <b>whatever,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> get out [...] The power to get out of those things is always within yourself. That's the message of the movie." [...] When Lopez read the script, she knew she was [...] "going to have to do [...] whole sequence at the end" [...] which featured an act that required her to [...] "become a believable lean, mean fighting machine." [...] Lopez then thought she should learn T'ai Chi or Tae Kwon Do, but was worried about learning it at an expert level {{in a short period of}} time. Her personal trainer then suggested that she study Krav Maga, the [...] "official self-defense system of the Israeli Defense Forces which has recently become trendy in the States. The fighting style focuses on combating realistic scenarios with moves that are based on common, instinctual reactions", according to MTV News. Talking about the system, Lopez said: [...] " [...] levels out the playing field between men and women [...] Where it doesn't matter how big or tall or strong you are. You can actually maneuver around that. It's about getting out of the way, counter attacking and using <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> to get the upper hand." ...|$|E

[...] He also {{suggested}} that power plants could use the dead bodies of Hindus as fuel. [...] "Jews," [...] el-Faisal said, [...] "should be killed ... as by Hitler." [...] He said: [...] "People with British passports, if you fly into Israel, it is easy. Fly into Israel and do <b>whatever</b> <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> If you die, you are up in paradise. How do you fight a Jew? You kill a Jew. In the case of Hindus, by bombing their businesses." ...|$|E
