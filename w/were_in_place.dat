5|$|Expert systems {{restricted}} {{themselves to}} a small domain of specific knowledge (thus avoiding the commonsense knowledge problem) and their simple design made it relatively easy for programs to be built and then modified once they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b> All in all, the programs proved to be useful: something that AI {{had not been able}} to achieve up to this point.|$|E
5|$|In October 2014, MART {{announced}} that it would run dedicated bus service from Gardner to Wachusett station when the station opened. By the end of 2014, retaining walls for ramps to the platforms and concrete bases for light poles in the parking lot <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b> Track and signal work on the Pan Am Southern mainline began in Spring 2015. In January 2015, the opening was delayed further to Fall 2016.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) {{investigated}} the collapses of the Twin Towers and 7WTC. The investigations examined why the buildings collapsed and what fire protection measures <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> and evaluated how {{fire protection systems}} might be improved in future construction. The investigation into the collapse of 1WTC and 2WTC was concluded in October 2005 and that of 7WTC was completed in August 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{termination}} of the Point Loma streetcar line was considered in 1923, but the San Diego Electric Railway decided to keep it running after residents opposed {{the idea of using}} buses instead. However, by 1946, bus lines <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> on Rosecrans Street, and a petition for increased bus service to Point Loma was given to the city in October 1947.|$|E
5|$|All 12,400 Chevrolet Volts {{produced}} until December 2011, {{including all}} Amperas in stock at European dealerships, {{were scheduled to}} receive the safety enhancements. Since production was halted during the holidays, the enhancements <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> when production resumed in early 2012. Sales continued, and dealers modified the Volts they had in stock. General Motors {{sent a letter to}} Volt owners indicating that they could schedule the service appointment to protect their batteries beginning in the last week of March 2012. General Motors also decided to replace the 120-volt charging cords in most of the nearly 10,000 Volts sold since late 2010. The new cords were enhanced to add durability, and some of the chargers built after February 5 have the new cords.|$|E
50|$|The {{church is}} {{constructed}} like a Baptist or Puritan church, so that visitors {{may think that}} the building is a Protestant church.

5|$|Although {{most of the}} defences <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> by {{the time}} of Ranulph's death in 1232, there were no living quarters, and neither were there on the death of Ranulph's {{successor}} John in 1237. John died without a male heir, allowing King Henry III to take over the Earldom of Cheshire. Henry enlarged Beeston Castle during his wars with Wales, and used it as a prison for his Welsh captives. No attempt was made to equip the castle as a permanent residence with halls and chambers; garrisons were probably housed in wooden structures within the outer bailey.|$|E
5|$|Australian coastwatchers {{stationed}} on New Britain were reinforced during September and October 1943 {{to provide}} warning of air attacks from Rabaul {{bound for the}} Allied landing sites and to report on Japanese barge and troop movements. In addition to a coastwatching team already in place at Cape Orford near Wide Bay, five other parties were sent to Cape Hoskins, Gasmata, Open Bay (on the north coast {{at the base of}} the Gazelle Peninsula), the area south of Wide Bay, and the neck between Wide Bay and Open Bay. The Gasmata party was discovered by the Japanese while en route to its destination and eliminated, but the other teams <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> by the end of October.|$|E
5|$|Because the self-anchored {{structure}} {{relies on}} the roadway itself to absorb stresses, the suspension cables could not be installed until the roadway was built; however, until the cables <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> the roadway could not be supported. To resolve this problem, Topham had the roadway built in sections, supported on very tall barges. The barges were floated into place at low tide, and the rising tide was used to lift the sections above {{the height of the}} piers. As the tide ebbed, the roadway dropped into place.|$|E
50|$|The {{borough of}} Mount Carmel manages LATS service through a {{contracted}} service provider, Catawese Coach Lines, {{a contract that}} has <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> since early <b>in</b> 2013. The previous contract was with King Coal Tours, an operator that had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> for over thirty years.|$|R
5000|$|A {{disadvantage}} is {{that when}} split tunneling is enabled, users bypass gateway level security that might <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> within the company infrastructure. [...] For example, if web or content filtering <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> this <b>is</b> something usually controlled at a gateway level, not the client PC.|$|R
50|$|The {{long-term}} {{water management}} plan {{is expected to}} <b>be</b> fully <b>in</b> <b>place</b> by fall 2017 and will replace the short-term water management plan that has <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> since Nov. 30, 2015.|$|R
5|$|By {{the time}} London Underground {{operations}} {{were transferred to}} the newly created Transport for London (TfL) in 2000, the A Stock trains were already 40 years old. The C Stock trains used on the Circle line, Hammersmith & City line and sections of the District line and the D Stock used on {{the remainder of the}} District line were also ageing, and no plans <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> for their replacement. Following lengthy and expensive negotiations, an order was placed in 2003 with Bombardier Transportation for a fleet of new trains to take over all operations on the Metropolitan, Hammersmith & City and District lines.|$|E
5|$|CMLL {{has been}} forced to declare the {{championship}} vacant four times. Each time, the reigning champion left CMLL without losing a match and the championship to whichever successor CMLL picked. Under normal circumstances, wrestlers give notice, or their contract is not renewed, and the championship transitions to a different wrestler. In the case of Cien Caras, Steel, and Héctor Garza, their departures from the company were so sudden and unexpected that no plans <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> and CMLL had to organize a tournament to determine the next champion. In Máximo Sexy's case he was fired from the company while still the champion, causing the championship to be vacated as a result.|$|E
5|$|Defences <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> at both bridges. On {{the west}} bank of the Caen Canal bridge there were three machine-gun emplacements and on the east bank a machine-gun and an {{anti-tank}} gun. To their north were another three machine-guns and a concrete pillbox. An anti-aircraft tower equipped with machine-guns stood to the south. At the River Orne bridge, the eastern bank south of the bridge had a pillbox with anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns. To the north of the bridge were two machine-guns. Both bridges had sandbagged trench systems along the banks.|$|E

5|$|During {{the day of}} 12 September, Kawaguchi's troops {{struggled}} through the jungle toward their assembly points for that night's attacks. Kawaguchi wanted his three Center Body battalions in place by 14:00, {{but they did not}} reach their assembly areas until after 22:00. Oka was also delayed in his advance towards the Marine lines in the west. Only the Kuma battalion reported that they <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> on time. Despite the problems in reaching the planned attack positions, Kawaguchi was still confident in his attack plan because a captured U.S. pilot disclosed that the ridge was the weakest part of the Marine defenses. Japanese bombers attacked the ridge during daytime on 11–12 September, causing a few casualties, including two killed.|$|E
5|$|Early Muslim {{writings}} {{confirm that}} the people of West Africa operated a sophisticated network of trade, usually under the authority of a monarch who levied taxes and provided bureaucratic and military support to his kingdom. Sophisticated mechanisms for the economic and political development of the involved African areas <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> before Islam further strengthened trade, towns and government in western Africa. The capital, court and trade of the region find mention in the works of scholar Abū 'Ubayd 'Abd Allāh al-Bakrī; the mainstay of the trans Saharan trade was gold and salt.|$|E
5|$|Evacuation plans already existed as a {{standard}} procedure for American embassies. At the beginning of March, fixed-wing aircraft began evacuating civilians from Tan Son Nhat Airport through neighboring countries. By mid-April, contingency plans <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> and preparations were underway for a possible helicopter evacuation. As the imminent collapse of Saigon became evident, Task Force 76 (TF76) was assembled off the coast near Vung Tau to support a helicopter evacuation and provide air support if required. In the event, air support was not needed as the North Vietnamese paused for {{a week at the}} outskirts of Saigon, possibly waiting for the South Vietnamese government to collapse and avoiding a possible confrontation with the U.S. by allowing the mostly-unopposed evacuation of Americans from Saigon.|$|E
