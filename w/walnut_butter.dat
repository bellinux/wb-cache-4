It is a yeast dough rolled and stretched paper thin and spread with a mixture of ground <b>walnuts,</b> <b>butter,</b> eggs, cream, and honey or sugar. It is then rolled jellyroll fashion and baked. Traditionally it was spiraled in a round pan, but now one is more likely to find it baked as a loaf.|$|R

50|$|A {{traditional}} Slovenian nut bread called potica {{served at}} Easter and Christmas {{is still very}} popular in northern Minnesota. It is a yeast dough rolled and stretched paper thin and spread {{with a mixture of}} ground <b>walnuts,</b> <b>butter,</b> eggs, cream, and honey or sugar. It is then rolled jellyroll fashion and baked. Traditionally it was spiraled in a round pan, but now one is more likely to find it baked as a loaf. The state is a productive area for chicken, dairy and turkey farms and crops such as corn, soybeans, and sugar beets and as such, eggs and meat along with potatoes and vegetables are mainstay foods. Warm baked goods along with stews and hearty soups are a favorite in the winter given the extreme Minnesota climate. Recipes using local wild game such as bison, deer or elk are also common. Other popular dishes statewide include glorified rice, Jell-O salad, and krumkake.|$|R
50|$|Walnut meats are {{available}} in two forms; in their shells or shelled. The meats can be as large as halves or any smaller portions that may happen during processing, candied or as an ingredient in other foodstuffs. Pickled walnuts that are the whole fruit can be savory or sweet depending on the preserving solution. <b>Walnut</b> <b>butters</b> can be homemade or purchased in both raw and roasted forms. All walnuts can be eaten on their own (raw, toasted or pickled) {{or as part of}} a mix such as muesli, or as an ingredient of a dish. For example, walnut soup and walnut pie are prepared using walnuts as a main ingredient. Walnut Whip, coffee and walnut cake, and pickled walnuts are more examples. Walnut is the main ingredient of Fesenjan, a khoresh (stew) in Iranian cuisine. Walnuts are also popular in brownie recipes, as ice cream toppings, and walnut pieces are used as a garnish on some foods. Nocino is a liqueur made from unripe green walnuts steeped in alcohol with syrup added.|$|R
50|$|The fair {{is also an}} {{occasion}} when local traders and people carry out brisk trade in local products such as wool, opium, honey, <b>walnut,</b> ghee (<b>butter</b> oil), and general merchandise from the region of Kangra, Kullu, Shimla, Bilaspur and from the neighbouring state of Punjab. It is said that the festivities promote handcrafted jewellery of the region. However, during the entire Mandi Shivaratri Fair, religiosity is the main theme. It is said that religious synthesis was achieved by combining the worship of Vishnu and Shiva cults during the seven-day fair.|$|R
50|$|The {{idea for}} brownie brittle and the crisps {{came from the}} {{hardened}} drippings that would come off the pans used in her plant, and she developed {{a new type of}} process that would only produce crispy brownie edges. The company relaunched “Brownie Crisps” as Brownie Brittle and the renamed product was first sold in retail stores in April 2011. It was the first commercial brownie crisp company in the United States. In 2012 the company received $8 million in sales, and received the “Best New Snack Product” prize at the National Confectionery Sales Association awards ceremony. Also in 2012 Brownie Brittle was nominated {{as one of the most}} innovative new products at the Sweets And Snacks Expo and had sold more than two million bags of the product. Brownie Brittle also entered a partnership with Weinstein Co. to provide snacks for movie premiers, as well as their Golden Globe and Oscar events. The flavors of Brownie Brittle are Chocolate Chip, Toffee Crunch, Dark Chocolate Sea Salt, Traditional <b>Walnut,</b> Peanut <b>Butter</b> Chip, Salted Caramel, and Mint Chocolate Chip.|$|R
40|$|Chronically hemodialyzed (HD) {{patients}} frequently {{suffer from}} quantitative {{and even more}} often qualitative serum lipids disorders. Mostly they have increased triglycerides and VLDL-cholesterol, slightly increased or normal total and LDL-cholesterol and decreased HDL-cholesterol concentrations. The study compared lipid profile between two groups of chronic HD patients coming from regionally distinct areas, the continental and the maritime one. The aim {{was to examine the}} hypothetic influence of their different dietary habits on lipid profile. The study included 72 patients from continental region (39 men) and 50 from maritime part of the country (30 men). Patients suffering from diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, liver disease, alcoholics as well as sevelamer treated patients were not included. Prior to a HD session the patients were determined fasting total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol, total proteins, albumins and C-reactive protein serum concentrations. All patients were undergoing bicarbonate hemodialysis with polysulphone dialysers of low permeability. The continental group of patients were somewhat older, undergoing HD for longer period of time, of lower height, greater weight, greater body mass index, higher total (4. 70 ± 0. 91 : 4. 42 ± 1. 02 mmol/L), and LDL-cholesterol (2. 78 ± 0. 74 : 2. 66 ± 0. 75 mmol/L) concentrations, while lower triglycerides (1. 72 ± 0. 84 : 1. 81 ± 0. 83 mmol/L) and HDL-cholesterol (1. 13 ± 0. 42 : 1. 16 ± 0. 54 mmol/L). However, all the differences were without statistical significance. Chi-square test showed that the continental group of patients consumed more often pork, bacon, smoked and cured meats, margarine, <b>butter,</b> <b>walnuts,</b> almonds, garlic, cream and full-fat cheese than fish. They prepare food more often with lard and sunflower oil. Almost every fourth continental patient received statins, while only every 25 th in the maritime group of patients. There were not any statistically significant Chi-square values for differences in frequencies of patients with total cholesterol greater than 5. 2 mmol/L, triglycerides above 1. 6 mmol/L, HDL-cholesterol less than 1. 1 mmol/L, LDL-cholesterol greater than 2. 6 mmol/L, obesity and malnutrition between the two groups. Based on {{the results of this study}} we have concluded that diet has significant influence on lipid profile of HD patients. Even though the continental and the maritime groups of patients differed significantly in diet, they were similar in plasmatic lipoprotein concentrations. However, this similarity was ascribed only to statin treatment, which was more frequent in the continental group of patients. The influence of ESRD and HD as a method of renal replacement therapy on lipid profile was not more dominant than diet...|$|R
