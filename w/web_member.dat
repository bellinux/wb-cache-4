First, the torsional and distortional deformations of a single cell mono symmetric box girder structure were examined using a single span, simply supported bridge structure on the bases of Vlasov’s theory. By introducing a middle (vertical) <b>web</b> <b>member</b> on the single cell mono symmetric box girder section a double cell mono symmetric box girder structure of the same overall cross sectional dimensions was obtained. The torsional and distortional deformations of the double cell cross sectional profile were also evaluated and {{compared with those of}} the mono symmetric cross sectional profile. Results show that the introduction of the middle <b>web</b> <b>member</b> to obtain the double cell mono symmetric box girder structure reduced the distortional deformation by 118 % and increased the torsional deformation by 14 % Keywords:- box girder, distortion, mono symmetric, thin-walled, torsion, Vlasov’s theory.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that rigidly-jointed truss beam-columns which are {{fabricated}} from circular tubes by welding have the high strength of lateral-torsional buckling. This is because the high torsional rigidity of tubular chords is effectively utilized against the lateral-torsional buckling, provided that the chords are well restraint by <b>web</b> <b>members.</b> However, the AIJ design standard uses the safest approximation and neglects the advantage of tubes or the restraining effect by <b>web</b> <b>members,</b> which obviously leads to uneconomical design.

Through the {{experiment}} {{of the six}} node models, this article obtained the axial force-deformation curves of the web members, the equivalent stress distribution curves under different loads of the tower {{within the scope of}} the node plate length.

There were no design provisions for effective length of compressive web members in tubular truss {{in the current}} design code of steel structure (GB 50017 - 2003). Based on previous research achievements, parameter analyses on compressive web members in tubular truss with simple joints were performed using finite element software, in which diameter ratios and wall thickness ratios of web members to chord members as well as different construction styles were considered. After analyzing 3 series, sum to 42 FEM model, the results indicates that stiffness ratio of web members to chord members has {{a significant effect on}} effective length of compressive web members, thus increasing width ratio of chord members to web members could decrease effective length of compressive web members; the effective length of compressive <b>web</b> <b>member</b> in circular tube truss is suitable to be 0. 75 in-plane and out-plane, and 0. 8 for the mixed truss of circular and square tube...|$|E

40|$|Composite beams {{constituted}} by a concrete-encased steel truss welded to a continuous steel plate are analyzed using a nonlinear finite element formulation based on Newmark's classical model. The <b>web</b> <b>member</b> {{of the steel}} truss is made by deformed or structural steel rebars and behaves like a deformable shear connection. In order to avoid slip locking, finite elements based on second-order interpolation of longitudinal displacements and flexural rotations are employed. Simply supported composite beams subjected to a uniformly distributed transverse load are considered. The bending capacity is evaluated for short up to long spans, taking the nonlinear behavior of concrete, steel and shear connection into account. The effects of the shear connection ductility are put in evidence, showing that, for short spans, the interfacial stress transfer resulting from the yielding of connection may be penalizing. In fact, the high slip gradient arising in sections near the supports {{may lead to a}} premature concrete failure. In this case, the exact solution to the linear elastic problem for steel–concrete composite beams can be used for design purposes...|$|E

After getting the optimized topology of web plates, the optimized layout of web members is formed through extracting the principal stress distribution.

40|$|The paper compares two elasto-plastic {{models for}} {{incorporating}} {{the effects of}} material nonlinearity into a finite element procedure in the large deflection analyses of angle beam columns and trusses. These are the fiber and the lumped plasticity models. In the fiber model, the element cross section is divided into {{a finite number of}} elementary areas, from which the sectional rigidities, resisting forces, and moments, allowing for material yielding and strain-unloading, are calculated. In the lumped plasticity model 2 ̆ 7, the inelastic behavior is defined for the whole cross section. The stress resultants in the cross section interact to produce yielding for the section. Yielding in the element is treated in a lumped manner, in which the plasticity effects are assumed to occur only at generalized locations (plastic hinges), while the element between the hinges remains elastic. Numerical studies of the large deflection behavior of restrained imperfect angle columns, K-braced angle frames, and of single-angle <b>web</b> <b>member</b> trusses using the two elasto-plastic models are presented.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. The Southern African Institute of Steel Construction {{expressed}} concern {{with regard to}} the unit definition of the effective length factor, K, stipulated for compressive elements of parallel chord trusses in Clause 15 of SANS 10162 - 1 : 2005 - Limit state design of hot-rolled steelwork. The simplified method for truss design specified in the code assumes all compression members are pin-connected, which allows for greater design simplicity and reduces the amount of code interpretation required by the designer. In addition to this, Clause 15 requires the additional reduction in resistance of the first <b>web</b> compression <b>members</b> by a factor of 0. 85. However, this approach may be considered overly conservative and in current design practice the effective length factor is often reduced to less than 1. 0. This research investigates the effective length factor of <b>web</b> compression <b>members</b> in parallel chord trusses, by means of investigative structural analyses of representative trusses using ANGELINE and Prokon analytical programs, and by designing, constructing and testing six representative trusses, using current design practices. A comparative study of a number of different countries’ codified approaches to truss design is also included. The structural analyses revealed that in-plane buckling of the <b>web</b> compression <b>members</b> was the consistent mode of failure, however at a much greater applied load than the design load determined according to SANS 10162 - 1 : 2005. Contrary to the expected mode of failure, all six tests performed on the representative trusses exhibited elastic out-of-plane buckling, or strongaxis buckling, of the <b>web</b> compression <b>members,</b> but still at a much greater applied load than the design load. The unexpected out-of-plane buckling of the <b>web</b> <b>members</b> is due to the inplane stiffness of the end connections used. In order to stay true to current design practice, gusset plates and longitudinal welds were used to join the <b>web</b> <b>members</b> to the chords. The stiffness of the gusset plates therefore significantly reduced the effective length of the <b>web</b> compression <b>members</b> in-plane, but did not reduce the effective length out-of-plane. Despite the unanticipated behaviour of the tests performed, certain conclusions can still be drawn from the results. The unit definition of the effective length factor for in-plane buckling of <b>web</b> compression <b>members</b> is too conservative and a K factor of 0. 8 is recommended. In addition to this an effective length factor for out-plane-buckling of <b>web</b> compression <b>members</b> of 1. 1 is recommended for trusses with welded connections. The necessity of the reduction in resistance of 0. 85 of the first <b>web</b> compression <b>members</b> requires further investigation. The most important conclusion to be drawn is that out-of-plane buckling of <b>web</b> compression <b>members</b> can be the dominant failure mode, which is not taken into consideration in current design practice...|$|R
