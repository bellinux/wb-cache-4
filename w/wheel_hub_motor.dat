50|$|The <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>motor</b> (also called wheel motor, {{wheel hub}} drive, hub motor or in-wheel motor) is an {{electric}} motor that is incorporated into the hub of a wheel and drives it directly.|$|E
5000|$|Practical wheel motor: Albert Parcelle of Boston, MA {{developed}} the first fully incorporated <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>motor</b> in his [...] "Electro-Motor Traction Wheel" [...] and patented it in patent US # 433,180 in 1890.|$|E
50|$|Eventually {{the growth}} in power of the {{gasoline}} engine overtook {{the power of the}} electric <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>motors</b> and this made up for any losses through a transmission. As a result, autos moved to gasoline engines with transmissions, but they were never as efficient as electric <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>motors.</b>|$|R

50|$|Pierre Couture, a Canadian {{inventor}} and engineer, {{has developed}} a <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>motor</b> in 1982. TM4 supplies engines, generators and inverters for the two markets it serves: TM4 is also engaged in the scale-up of its technology - first used in the transportation industry - to power wind turbines.|$|E
50|$|In 1953, LeTourneau {{sold his}} entire {{earthmoving}} equipment {{line to the}} Westinghouse Air Brake Company. He then applied his ingenuity {{to the development of}} the electric wheel drive concept. In 1958, at the age of seventy, LeTourneau re-entered the earthmoving equipment manufacturing business, offering contractors a range of high capacity earthmoving, transportation, and material handling machines based on the revolutionary electric wheel drive system he had developed. An electric wheel drive is also called an electric <b>Wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|E
50|$|This is a series-hybrid {{arrangement}} and {{is common in}} diesel-electric locomotives and ships (the Russian river ship Vandal launched in 1903, was the world's first diesel-powered and diesel-electric powered vessel) and Ferdinand Porsche successfully used this arrangement in the early 20th century in racing cars, including the Lohner-Porsche Mixte Hybrid. Porsche named the system System Mixte, which had a <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>motor</b> arrangement, with a motor {{in each of the}} two front wheels, setting speed records.|$|E
5000|$|Road vehicles: <b>Wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>motors</b> date to {{the late}} 19th century, and used in modern (2000s) {{electric}} vehicle concepts ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>motors</b> are {{increasingly}} common on electric bikes and electric scooters {{in some parts}} of the world, especially Asia.|$|R
50|$|The motors {{that are}} used in these {{vehicles}} are commonly <b>Wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>motors,</b> since no transmission components are then required. Alternative layouts with inboard motors and drive shafts are also possible.|$|R
50|$|The {{electric}} <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>motor</b> was raced by Ferdinand Porsche in 1897 in Vienna, Austria. Porsche's first engineering {{training was}} electrical, not internal combustion based. As a result, he developed his first cars as electric cars with electric wheel hub motors that ran on batteries. The Lohner Porsche, fitted with one wheel motor {{in each of}} the front wheels, appeared at the World Exhibition in Paris in 1900 and created a sensation in the young automobile world. In the following years, 300 Lohner Porsches were made and sold to wealthy buyers.|$|E
5000|$|When {{describing}} cars, {{the battery}} {{of a series}} hybrid is usually charged by being plugged in - but technically a series-hybrid allows for a battery to only act as a buffer (and for regeneration purposes), and for the electric motor's power to be supplied constantly by the supporting engine. Series arrangements have been common in diesel-electric locomotives and ships. Ferdinand Porsche effectively invented this arrangement in racing cars in the early 20th century, such as the Lohner-Porsche Mixte Hybrid, with Porsche naming the arrangement [...] "System Mixt" [...] - a <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>motor</b> arrangement, with a motor {{in each of the}} two front wheels was used, setting speed records. This arrangement was sometimes referred to as an electric transmission, as the electric generator and driving motor replaced a mechanical transmission. The vehicle could not move unless the internal combustion engine was running.|$|E
40|$|The German Aerospace Centre {{has dealt}} with the {{question}} of whether it is possible to tax a passenger aircraft without emissions on the taxiing field. The Institute of Vehicle Concepts has designed and built a prototype of an electric <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>motor</b> to use it in the research aircraft Airbus A 320 of the German Aerospace Centre. Special requirements to the motor are the torque for break away operation, the static load and the possibility to switch two gear ratios. The project was a part of an overall research project for the integration of fuel cells in aircrafts to reduce fuel consumption and air pollution. A positive side effect is the reduction of the ground-based transport vehicles traffic and thus a reduction in the risk of accidents. The paper describes the development of the electric <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>motor...</b>|$|E
40|$|To {{optimize}} the {{energy efficiency and}} to reduce the CO 2 -emissions in the railway transport area new vehicle concepts are needed. Regarding the drive concept for high-speed trains the question of using <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>motors</b> always comes back into the discussion. Especially for low-floor vehicles or double-deck vehicles {{it is likely to}} use the space, which is now taken by the chassis, {{to use it as a}} walk-through area. The distribution of the drive power between several axes represents another advantage. In this paper basic considerations for the design of <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>motors</b> for high speed trains with electrically excited synchronous machines are carried out...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} field study investigating {{the impact of}} single <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>motor</b> failures on the dynamic behavior of a vehicle and the corresponding driver reaction is presented in this work. The experiment is performed at urban speeds on a closed off test track. The single <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>motor</b> failure is emulated with an auxiliary brake system in a modified electric vehicle. Driver reaction times are derived from the measured data and discussed in their experimental context. The failure is rated and evaluated objectively based on the dynamic behavior of the vehicle. Findings indicate that driver reactions are more apparent for the accelerator pedal compared to the steering wheel response. The controllability evaluation of the vehicle behavior shows that no critical traffic situation occurs for the tested failure conditions. However, even small deviations of the vehicle can impair traffic safety, specifically for other traffic participants like bicyclist and pedestrians. QC 20150520 </p...|$|E

40|$|Referring to the "Federal Government's National Development Plan for Electric Mobility" it is Germany's aim {{to become}} the lead market for {{electric}} mobility {{and to keep the}} leadership in science and automobile industries. The goal is to achieve one million electric vehicles on Germany's roads until 2020. To be competitive on this market new design optimized for electric vehicles need to be developed. One promising technology for the electric power train is the <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>motor.</b> As they are integrated in the wheel, gears and drive shafts are obsolete enabling large potential for savings. In this paper the design and safety challenges for <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>motor</b> engineers are described. Beside basic design features, the main focus is on loads for motor and chassis dimensioning. In particular the effects of increased unsprung masses are discussed on basis of measurement data collected with the Fraunhofer concept car. It turns out that due to higher unsprung masses some of the wheel and chassis components are subjected to increased stress on a moderate level. Finally rig testing concepts for wheel hub motors are presented to ensure the structural durability and operational reliability under the influence of acting wheel forces...|$|E

5000|$|Still {{employed}} by Lohner, Porsche introduced the [...] "Lohner-Porsche Mixte Hybrid" [...] in 1901: {{instead of a}} massive battery-pack, an internal combustion engine built by the German firm Daimler drove a generator which in turn drove the electric <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>motors.</b> As a backup a small battery pack was fitted. This is the first petroleum electric hybrid vehicle on record, although since sufficiently reliable gears and couplings were not available at the time, he chose {{to make it a}} series-hybrid, an arrangement now more common in diesel-electric or turbo-electric railway locomotives than in automobiles.|$|R

40|$|A failure-sensitive driver {{model has}} been {{developed}} in the research study presented in this paper. The model is based on measurements of human responses to dierent failure conditions inuencing the vehicle directional stability in a moving-base driving simulator. The measurements were made in a previous experimental study where test subjects were exposed to three sudden failure conditions that required adequate corrective measures to maintain the vehicle control and regain the planned trajectory. A common driver model and a failure-sensitive driver model have been compared, and results for the latter agree well with the measured data. The proposed failure-sensitive driver model is capable of maintaining the vehicle control and regaining the planned trajectory similarly {{to the way in}} which humans achieved this during a <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>motor</b> failure in one of the rear wheels.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an overall simulation approach {{to control the}} noise emission of car engines {{at a very early}} stage of the design process where no real prototypes are available. The suggested approach combines different physical models and couples different software tools such as multi-body analysis, fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, magneto-electrodynamics, thermodynamics, acoustics and control as well. The general overall simulation methodology is presented first. Then, this methodology is applied to a combustion engine in order to improve its acoustical behavior by passive means, such as changing the stiffness and the use of damping materials to build acoustic and thermal encapsulations. The active control by applying piezoelectric patch actuators at the oil sump as the noisiest part of the engine is discussed as well. The sound emission is evaluated by hearing tests and a mathematical prediction model of the human perception. Finally, it is shown that the presented approach can be extended to electric engines, which is demonstrated at a newly developed electric <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>motor...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{nonlinear}} control strategy for electric bicycles that adjusts the motor assistance automatically {{to maintain a}} desired heart rate level of the cyclist. The control algorithm uses the current heart rate, torque and cadence of the rider as inputs, and adjusts {{the assistance of the}} motor adaptively. The controller consists of feedforward as well as feedback components: Whereas the heart rate is the feedback component, the system's feedforward component is the rider's estimated torque output at the desired heart rate level. Environmental changes like slope or headwind are modeled as disturbances that the controller has to reject. We conduct test rides with one subject at different intensity levels to develop and validate a nonlinear heart rate response model of the bicycle rider. The model uses the power output of the cyclist as an input and takes immediate and gradual responses of the heart rate into account. We use a commercial electric bicycle with a front <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>motor</b> to test the controller design. The bicycle is modified to measure torque output and pedalling frequency of the rider and to control the motor torque. The heart rate is measured by a chest strap. Data processing and controller design were performed on a laptop. We present simulation as well as experimental results for different reference heart rate profiles to verify the performance of the controller...|$|E
50|$|The major {{disadvantage}} of <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>motors</b> {{are that the}} weight of the electric motors would increase the unsprung weight, which adversely affects handling and ride (the wheels are more sluggish in responding to road conditions, especially fast motions over bumps, and transmit the bumps to the chassis instead of absorbing them). Most conventional electric motors include ferrous material composed of laminated electrical steel. This ferrous material contributes most of the weight of electric motors. To minimize this weight several recent wheel motor designs have minimized the electrical steel content of the motor by utilizing a coreless design with Litz wire coil windings to reduce eddy current losses. This significantly reduces wheel motor weight and therefore unsprung weight.|$|R

With four wheel individual large range steering and electric <b>wheel</b> <b>hub</b> <b>motors,</b> the {{vehicle dynamics}} variables of yaw rate, side slip angle and vehicle velocity can be decoupled, thus opening new motion possibilities. The HMI approach includes distinction of various motion operating modes, suitable reference motion parameterization and adequate filtering of the operator’s inputs, both depending on the operating mode. For rotating on the spot the instantaneous center of rotation may be interactively set by the operator on a touch screen...|$|R
