40|$|Abstract [...] Iron nI for Ti TM {{substitution}} in {{the structure}} of pedogenic and synthetic anatase of up to Fe/ (Ti+Fe) 0. 1 mol/mol was indicated by an increase in unit cell size as measured by XRD line shifts. MiSssbauer-and electron paramagnetic resonance spectra at both, 298 K and 4. 2 K supported this by the presence of signals typical for octahedrally coordinated Fe I 11 in a diamagnetic matrix. Charge compensation was achieved by structural OH, as indicated by FTIR bands at 3360 and 960 cm-~, which were absent in pure anatase and which disappeared on heating. The <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> <b>heating</b> amounted to ca. 0. 5 mol H 20 /mol Fe.

Chemical analysis, grading analysis, various thermal tests, differential thermal analysis, X-ray analysis, infrared absorption spectra analysis and electron microscopic survey etc., {{were conducted on}} the thirteen white clay samples selected in these districts. These clays are exceptionally poor in iron and much in alumina; therefore it is hopeful for ceramic raw materials and filler or coating materials of paper. It is very likely that the main component mineral of these clays is kaolinite and includs quartz, opal and alunite. Among these including minerals, alunite is not preferable for the earthenware raw material by reason of the cause of cracking or bloting of ware on firing. We determined the content of alunite by measuring of <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> <b>heating</b> or alkali content of samples.

A small quantity of sample powder, 18. 0 mg for Osaka Nanko Clay or 12. 2 mg for Osaka Umeda Clay, was put in a Al-pan in thesize of 5 mm diameter and of 3 mm depth and was set on sample holder of the apparatus alongsideof Al-pan in the same size which contained the a-Al 2 O 3 powder as reference materials. About 10 mg of distiled water was poured into clay sample and was evaporated at room temperature. After the cease of spontaneous evaporation, both pans were heated at the rate 1. 25 ℃/min up to a des-ignated temperature and were held at that temperature until the decrease of weight was not reco-gnized on TG record.

40|$|Decades of {{work have}} shown that trace- to minor-amounts of hydrous {{components}} commonly occur in minerals whose chemical formula would be normally written without any hydrogen, namely, the nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs). When the concentrations of the hydrous components are several tenths of a percent by weight or higher, a variety of analytical methods such as <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> <b>heating,</b> X-ray cell parameters, X-ray structure refinement, Karl-Fischer titrations, or even careful electron microprobe analyses {{can be used to}} establish their concentrations (e. g., Aines and Rossman 1991). However, for most NAMs, accurate determinations with these common analytical methods prove difficult if not impossible. For this reason, infrared (IR) spectroscopy has become, and remains, the most widely used method to detect and analyze hydrous components (OH or H_ 2 O) in minerals and glasses because it is both highly sensitive and can be done rapidly with a commonly available, modestly priced instrument and at dimensions of just a few tens of micrometers. A change in the electric dipole occurs when the OH bond in either water and hydroxyl ions vibrate. This motion has a resonance coupling with electromagnetic radiation generally in the 3500 cm^(- 1) region of the infrared spectrum. In addition, bending motions of the water molecule, and overtones and combination of these motions produce absorption in the infrared...|$|E

40|$|Background: Altered {{levels of}} markers of {{oxidative}} stress, DNA repair, and telomere integrity {{have been detected}} in obese individuals and may underlie the pathogenesis of obesity-related diseases. However, whether or not such effects are reversed by intentional <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> has not been systematically reviewed. Methods: A literature search in PubMed/Medline identified 2, 388 articles of which 21 studies (randomized controlled trial (RCT) (n = 10) and non-randomized intervention studies (n = 11)) were classified as testing the effects of intentional <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> i) oxidative stress (n = 15), ii) DNA repair (n = 2), and iii) telomere length (n = 4). Results: Across {{a broad range of}} intervention designs, diet-, exercise-, surgery-, balloon-induced <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> regimens decreased oxidative stress measures. Studies investigating DNA repair capacity or telomere length as endpoints after <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> were less common in number and yielded null or inconsistent results, respectively. Conclusion: While this systematic review supports a role for intentional <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> in reducing obesity-associated oxidative stress, {{it is not clear whether}} the effects are primary outcomes or secondary to improvement in obesity-associated insulin resistance and/or chronic inflammation. Although the lack of effect of intentional <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> DNA repair capacity might be anticipated given that oxidative stress is reduced, additional studies are needed. The inconsistent effects of <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> telomere length or DNA repair suggest the need for a re-assessment of intervention designs and assay methodology to definitively address this topic...|$|R

Marshall WG, Hazewinkel HA, Mullen D, De Meyer G, Baert K, Carmichael S. Small Animal Hospital, University of Glasgow Veterinary School, Bearsden Road, Glasgow, Scotland, UK. w. marshall@vet. gla. ac. uk Abstract This paper describes {{the effect of}} <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> lameness in obese dogs with osteoarthritis (OA). Fourteen obese client-owned dogs with clinical and radiographic signs of OA participated in an open prospective clinical trial. After a screening visit and a visit for collection of baseline data, the dogs were fed a restricted-calorie diet over a study period of 16 weeks that incorporated six follow-up visits. At each visit, body weight and pelvic circumference were measured and severity of lameness was assessed using a numeric rating scale (NRS), a visual analogue scale (VAS) and kinetic gait analysis. This is the first study to assess both subjectively and objectively, the effect of <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> alone <b>on</b> lameness in obese dogs with OA. The results indicate that body weight reduction causes {{a significant decrease in}} lameness from a <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> of 6. 10 % onwards.

These results confirm that <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> should be presented as an important treatment modality to owners of obese dogs with OA and that noticeable improvement may be seen after modest <b>weight</b> <b>loss</b> in the region of 6. 10 - 8. 85 % body weight.
