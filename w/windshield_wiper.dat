25|$|The <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> is a bladed device used to wipe {{rain and}} dirt from a windshield. In 1903, Mary Anderson is {{credited}} with inventing the first operational <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper.</b> In Anderson's patent, she called her invention a window cleaning device for electric cars and other vehicles. Operated via a lever from inside a vehicle, her version of windshield wipers closely resembles the <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> found on many early car models. Anderson had a model of her design manufactured. She then filed a patent (U.S. patent number 743,801) on June 18, 1903 that was issued to her by the U.S. Patent Office on November 10, 1903.|$|E
25|$|The bubble top on the KR200 was {{simplified}} {{over that}} of the KR175 {{by the use of}} a larger curved glass windshield that formed A-pillars with the side window frames. This allowed the bubble to be simpler and more compact than the KR175 bubble, and it was consequently easier and less expensive to produce. The <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper,</b> manual on the KR175, was electric on the KR200.|$|E
25|$|The C5 {{was also}} the first Corvette to {{incorporate}} a drive-by-wire throttle; and variable-effort steering, whereby the assist level of the power steering is varied according to vehicle speed (more at lower speeds, less at higher speeds). Also notable, though rarely discussed, the C5 generation was the first model to adopt the parallel or 'tandem' <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> configuration, abandoning the opposed configuration that was used on every previous Corvette model since the first in 1953.|$|E

25|$|The {{effect that}} {{windshield}} wipers {{have on a}} vehicles airflow varies between vehicles; however, they are often omitted from race vehicles and high efficiency concepts {{in order to maintain}} the smallest possible coefficient of drag. A much more common option is to replace the windshield wipers with lower profile wipers, or to only remove the <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> on the passenger side of the vehicle, and even to fabricate a deflector to deflect the air up and over the wipers.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{started in}} 1613 and {{proceeded}} from west to east, across {{the breadth of}} the layout, like a gigantic <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> as the historian Geert Mak calls it – and not from the centre outwards, as a popular myth has it. The canal construction in the southern sector was completed by 1656. Subsequently, the construction of residential buildings proceeded slowly. The eastern part of the concentric canal plan, covering the area between the Amstel river and the IJ bay, has never been implemented. In the following centuries, the land was used for parks, senior citizens' homes, theatres, other public facilities, and waterways without much planning.|$|E
2500|$|The new {{platform}} {{came with}} significantly different styling, {{which was more}} squared-off and angular than the outgoing Series III. Individual round headlamps were replaced with rectangular units on the higher-specification cars, and all models came with only a single, wide-sweeping <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper.</b> The interior received several modernisations such as the switch to a digital instrument cluster (although this was eventually discontinued for MY 1990 in favour of analogue instruments.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Being {{based on}} the Kabinenroller platform, the KR175 had tandem seating {{accessed}} by a hatch that opened upward and to the right. The standard version of the KR175's hatch had a canopy made from a large Plexiglas dome with a cutout at the front for a small, flat glass windshield and a cutout on either side for the frames for the sliding windows. A [...] "sportster" [...] model was available without the dome or the windows, with only the windshield attached. The <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> was manually operated.|$|E
2500|$|Ninomiya {{was born}} in Katsushika, Tokyo as the {{youngest}} child of his family. His father and mother were both working as chefs when they met and his sister is {{two years older than}} he is. [...] When Ninomiya was born, his grandfather immediately came home and named him the heir to the family's <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> factory since he was his grandfather's only grandson. However, when Ninomiya was twelve years old, his cousin sent in an application to Johnny & Associates without his knowledge. After attending and passing the auditions due to his mother's prodding, he joined the talent agency.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with the}} Taurus, {{a new model}} of Taurus SHO was {{launched}} for 1996. Although it contained less aggressive styling than its predecessors, it still differed from the normal Taurus with different seats, wheels, bumpers, drivetrain, as well as a fin being put on the driver's side <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper,</b> to keep it on the windshield at high speeds. A [...] aluminum 3.4L V8 engine with heads from Yamaha and block from Cosworth was specified for the SHO model, but it was given the same 4-speed transmission as the LX: the manual gearbox option was no longer offered on the SHO. This was partly because this model of SHO was designed for comfort instead of performance.|$|E

2500|$|Stretched in all dimensions, the Premier {{provided}} more interior room {{than any of}} its contemporaries. The interior was an all-new design by AMC's in-house staff {{under the direction of}} Richard A. Teague. It also included features that were considered unique at the time. The instrument panel featured [...] "a heavy dose of electronics", with all driver controls housed within a fingertip distance from the steering wheel. It used an unusual dash mounted gear selector with a thin metal lever {{at the end of which}} was a grip handle; instead if the gear selector shifting downward in the traditional fashion, the lever dropped into the dash pod in which it was mounted. The climate controls used an unusual up-down button that cycled through the different heating modes, indicated by an array of lights. All of these controls were housed in a control panel on the right side of the steering column. On the left side of the column another control contained the light and <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> controls. The turn signal control was also electronic returning to its centered position immediately after a driver signaled a turn, and a gong indicated its cancellation after completing a turn. The optional cruise control was built into the leather-wrapped steering wheel. Other features included intermittent wipers, as well as automatic variable-speed that adjusted wiper speed to the amount of water that hit the windshield; with less moisture, the slower they would move, but increasing their action if a passing truck splashed the windshield with a large amount of water. Standard on all Premiers was an electronically tuned stereo sound system.|$|E
2500|$|... 1972 was {{the last}} year for chrome bumpers at both front and rear, the vacuum {{actuated}} pop-up <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> door, as well as the removable rear window common to all 1968-72 coupes. The key activated anti-theft alarm system became standard. The increasingly popular choice of an automatic transmission was installed in most corvettes for the first time, with nearly 54 percent so equipped. This year SAE net measurement for horsepower was now utilized (away from the previous SAE gross standard), and was largely responsible for the much lower engine output figures such as the [...] rating on the standard [...] motor. This was the final year for the LT-1 engine, rated at , and the ZR1 racing package built around it. Although the M22 HD 4-speed was no longer a Regular Production Option, it continued to be fitted to cars outfitted with the ZR1 package. The LT-1 could now be ordered with air conditioning, a combination not permitted the two previous years. The LS5 [...] big block was again available and came in at [...] Noteworthy is in ’72 the LS5 was not available to California buyers. This {{was the beginning of a}} trend where Chevrolet restricted certain power train choices to California buyers due to that state's practice of applying more stringent emission (smog) standards than mandated by federal regulations. Convertibles were a vanishing breed by ‘72, and the Stingray was no exception. It sold only 6,508 copies, amounting to 9% of the market, placing it number three; it was beaten by the number one-selling , with 11,571, but beat the Impala's 6,456 and the Mustang's 6,401. Rare options: ZR1 special engine package (20), shoulder belts with convertibles (749), LT1 engine option (1,741).|$|E
5000|$|Windshield Wiper/360 Windshield Wiper: The rider spins a tailwhip and, {{while still}} in the air, spins another tailwhip back the other way. Matt Sparks was the first rider {{to do it on}} a BMX bike in 2006, calling it a <b>Windshield</b> <b>Wiper.</b> A 360 <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> is when the rider spins a 360 degree {{rotation}} while doing a <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> at the same time. James foster did it in 2008 at the Jomopro contest in Joplin, MO. Foster also landed it in the fifth Cameron White Annual Dirt Jam. The trick has also been pulled by Kyle Baldock, Alessandro Barbero, among others. Baldock landed a 360 <b>windshield</b> <b>wiper</b> to late tailwhip at the 2011 Salt Lake City Dew Tour.
