40|$|Abstract. One of {{the main}} {{objectives}} in obtaining high productivity on machining centers is the reduction of auxiliary times consumed with the tool and <b>workpiece</b> <b>change.</b> In the case of <b>workpiece</b> <b>change</b> the auxiliary time is reduced by adopting {{the use of an}} automatic pallet changer system and implicitly of pallets, while in the case of tool change this time is reduced using an automatic tool changer system. The optimization of the constructive and functional parameters of palletizing systems, in the purpose of decreasing auxiliary times, implies increased speed and accelerations, inertia reduction, an optimum transmission ratio, component mechanisms coupled movements, increasing the positioning accuracy of the pallet on the machine table. This paper presents the methodology of transmission ratio optimization of an electric driven pallet changer mechanism; the main purpose is to obtain the maximum acceleration. In order to find the maximum acceleration of the electric driven pallet changing mechanism considered, and thus minimizing the total changing time, we use the equilibrium equation of the moments reduced to the motor shaft. Following the proposed methodology we obtain the maximum acceleration of the considered pallet changer mechanism. Also we issue some constructive indications for future designing of electric driven pallet changer mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|On machine tools, precise {{control of}} the {{position}} of the tool tip relative to the workpiece is required to follow the desired path where quality of producing parts is significantly dependent on dynamic performance. The design of such a controller that can perform with all plant uncertainties is a major challenge. It is therefore the aim of this paper to assess the performance of a new design methodology that may enhance the performance of machine tool feed drives. The controller in general has a form of P/PI/PID (Proportional/ Integral/Derivative) compensators that is easy to implement in practice and does not require additional hardware. In addition to a simple structure, the design applies the principles of a phase margin approach to allow the self-tuning controller to automatically update the controller settings. This ability is required to optimise control when the position and the mass of the fixture and/or <b>workpiece</b> <b>change.</b> Effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated in Matlab simulation, where its performance found good enough for industrial application...|$|E

The high speed, small diameter, and the brittleness of the material, make the bits very subject to breaking, particularly if {{the angle of the}} bit to the <b>workpiece</b> <b>changes</b> at all, or the bit contacts any object.

40|$|A new three-color {{infrared}} radiation pyrometer using an optical fiber is developed for measuring cutting temperature in high speed machining by small ball end mill. The high speed air spindle unit is adopted to the ordinary milling machine so that the maximum spindle revolution of 40000 rpm is attainable. The ball radius of the carbide cutter is 3 mm and the side cutting of carbon steel with ballnose is executed without cutting fluid. Cutting temperature distribution along the ball-nosed cutting-edge is measured. The influences of spindle rotational speed, radial depth of cut and feed per tooth on the temperature distribution at the flank face are examined. The maximum temperature of peripheral cutting edge about 700 °C is obtained even at the rotation angle of 180 ° after cutting, and it drops along the ballnose toward the ball tip. Relatively large temperature gradient arises along the ball cutting-edge at higher spindle revolution because cutting speed depends on the local tool radius. Depth of cut and feed per tooth, at the same time, affect the overall temperature at the ball cutting edges. The cooling characteristics in air cutting reveals that the temperature difference during one cycle of intermittent cutting increases as spindle speed decreases. The relationship between the peripheral cutting speed and the tool temperature varies from tool shank to ball tip because the interactions between cutting edge and <b>workpiece</b> <b>change</b> along the ballnose...|$|E

In laser remelting process of a workpiece we have used several laser beam passages across the workpiece surface.

In the process of gradual remelting of the specimen surface, i. e. during its heating and cooling, volume changes in the specimen surface layer occur due to thermal and microstructural changes. To {{find out more about}} volume changes in the thin surface layer of specimens, the latter were monitored by measuring the strain at the lower side of the specimens during and after the remelting process, and also by residual stress measurement in the thin surface layer.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to study the laser spot welding process of low carbon steel sheet. The investigations were based on analytical and finite element analyses. The analytical analysis was focused on a consistent set of equations representing interaction of the laser beam with materials. The numerical analysis based on 3 -D finite element analysis of heat flow during laser spot welding taken into account the temperature dependence of the physical properties and latent heat of transformations using ANSYS code V. 10. 0 to simulate the laser welding process. The effect of laser operating parameters on the results of the temperature profile were studied in addition to the effect on thermal stresses and dimensions of the laser welded workpiece which showed good correlations between analytical and numerical results. It was found that the temperature gradients during laser welding are usually very large and it was viewed that very high temperature {{at the center of the}} workpiece, and is decreased very significantly as propagating along the radial direction. Also it found that the thermal residual stresses around the laser spot due to plastic strains were very small and localized within 1. 0 mm range. It is concluded that the laser welding process is effective to reduce the welding residual stress. The stresses along the lateral direction of the <b>workpiece</b> <b>changed</b> from compression at the spot under the laser beam and tension away from the spot at the end of welding to tension at the spot under the laser beam and compression away from the spot when it cooled, which are in a good agreement with the published results...|$|R

By analyzing the abrasive process of different particle sizes on single crystal copper, we investigated the internal material deformation, {{the formation of}} chips, the stress distribution, and the change of cutting force. Results showed that shear band deformation was generated along the cutting direction at approximately 45 ° inside the workpiece material. The deformation was accompanied by dislocations and sliding phenomena in the shear band region. Smaller abrasive particle size led to poor quality of the workpiece, while a larger particle size led to better quality.

40|$|The laser {{remelting}} {{process is}} a very promising hardening method for ferrous and non-ferrous alloys which do not show a homogeneous microstructural state after being heat treated in a traditional way. Consequently, the alloys concerned do not achieve the required hardness of the surface layer and do notprovide the required wear resistance. The present paper deals with residualstress and strain changes in thin flat specimens of nodular cast iron 500 - 7 in the laser remelting process. In the process of gradual remelting of the specimen surface, i. e. during its heating and cooling, volume changes in the specimen occur due to thermal and microstructural changes. To {{find out more about}} volume changes in the thin surface layer of specimens, the latter were monitored by strain measurement at the lower side of the specimens duringthe remelting process and by residual stress measurement in the thin surface layer after the remelting process. The strain was measured using a resistance rosette, placed {{on the opposite side of}} the remelted layer, and the temperature was measured in the same place simultaneously. In laser remelting of a workpiece, such remelting conditions should ensure that a uniform thickness of the modified layer is obtained, in spite of several laserbeam passages across the workpiece surface. Owing to the multiple passageof the laser beam across the workpiece surface, the state of internal stress in the <b>workpiece</b> <b>changes</b> and, consequently, undesired strain may occur. Such strain may result in greater consumption of material and additional machining which, in turn, may result in higher cost of the machined parts. The results obtained confirmed that on the basis of knowing the strain occurring during the remelting process and the residual stress, the process could be successfully optimised. On the basis of knowing the strains occurring during the remelting process and the residual stress, optimal laser surface remelting conditions were chosen, while the method of guiding the laser beam over the surface of the flat samples and the degree of overlap were varied...|$|R

40|$|Flexible {{electronics}} {{will have}} inorganic devices grown at elevated temperatures on free-standing foil substrates. The thermal contraction mismatch between the substrate and the deposited device films, and the built-in stresses in these films, cause curving {{and a change}} in the in-plane dimensions of the <b>workpiece.</b> This <b>change</b> causes misalignment between the device layers. The thinner and more compliant the substrate, the larger the curvature and the misalignment. We model this situation with the theory of a bimetallic strip, which suggests that the misalignment can be minimized by tailoring the built-in stress introduced during film growth. Amorphous silicon thin-film transistors (a-Si:H TFTs) fabricated on stainless steel or polyimide (PI) (Kapton E®) foils need tensile built-in stress to compensate for the differential thermal contraction between the silicon films and the substrate. Experiments show that by varying the built-in stress in just one device layer, the gate silicon nitride (SiNx), one can reduce the misalignment between the source/drain and the gate levels from ∼ 400 parts-per-million to ∼ 100 parts-per-million...|$|R

The current research investigates the effect of dry machining of Ti 6 Al 4 V on surface integrity of machined <b>workpiece.</b> A <b>change</b> in subsurface deformation was assessed by varying cutting speed and feed rate keeping the cut depth constant.

At lower cutting parameters, work hardening phenomenon however; at high cutting parameters thermal softening phenomenon becomes more dominant. This was derived with increased surface roughness, reduction in microhardness values beneath the machined surface and coarse microstructure obtained at higher cutting parameters. A Chip microstructural analysis validates the thermal softening and work hardening phenomenon where at high cutting speeds and feed rate the shear band formation is increased accompanied with increased chip segmentation frequency. However, at lower cutting parameters the reduction segmentation frequency and more deformed grains near shear band were observed...|$|R

When a stair-shaped workpiece is machined, poor electrolyte flow around the steps leads to wire rupture or unstable machining. This paper presents a WEDM adaptive control system that maintains optimal machining and improves the stability of machining at the stair section where <b>workpiece</b> thickness <b>changes.</b> A three-layer back propagation neural network is used to estimate the thickness of a workpiece. The developed adaptive control system is executed in the hierarchical structure of three control loops, using fuzzy control strategy.

In the second control loop, the proportion of abnormal sparks is maintained at a pre-determined level for process control purposes. Based on the estimated thickness of a workpiece, adaptive parameter optimisation is carried out to determine the optimal machining settings and to provide the reference targets for the other two control loops.

40|$|Aluminium alloys is {{desirable}} for the automotive and electronic appliances industries {{due to their}} high strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance and weldability. However applications of the aluminium alloys were very difficult because aluminium alloys formability is very low at room temperature, despite their advantages. One of the high speed forming technologies is Electromagnetic Metal Forming (EMF), which can be useful forming method for low formability light-weight materials such as aluminium, magnesium alloys in overcoming the limitations of conventional forming methods. EMF process refers to the high velocity and high strain rate deformation of low-formability materials driven by electromagnetic forces that are generated by the rapid discharge current through forming coil.

40|$|In the {{discrete}} part manufacturing industry, engineers develop process plans {{by selecting}} appropriate machining processes and production equipment {{to ensure the}} quality of finished components. The decisions in process planning are usually made based on personal experience and the verification of process plans is based on physical trial-and-error runs, which is costly and time-consuming.

In this way, engineers can quickly screen alternative process plans, spot the root error causes, and improve their decisions.

30|$|The {{material}} being welded experiences {{very hot}} processing conditions as the tool pin rotates {{at very high}} speeds. Therefore, excessive heat generated, thermally softens the material near the boundary of the tool-shoulder and expels large volumes of material {{in the form of}} surface flash. Excessive tool-shoulder frictional heat softening of the material is the reason for the formation of the flash, and high tool-shoulder pressure leads to the ejection of an excessive amount of flash (Bo et al. 2011). Incorrect tool pin length relative to <b>workpiece</b> thickness and <b>change</b> in penetration depth due to variation in plate thickness along the weld line or due to a bowed plate can lead to a lack of penetration. When the pin plug depth is high, the plastic material near the pin is extruded, which results in weld flash. When the pin depth is very high, extruded flash can occur at the roots of the weld, near the pin. At larger tool tilt angles, insufficient plasticised material remains to fill the cavity left in the weld nugget and weld flash appears on the retreating side (Keivani et al. 2013).|$|R

An elastic-plastic finite element simulation was performed for a single forming trial. The heat transferred to the die, computed from the simulation, was then used as an input for the multi-cycle heat loading analysis in the die. Two materials: silver and low carbon steel, were used as the work material. The results show that the die saturation temperature could still go up to 100 °C for small size dies, which is significant for the forming of micro-parts.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the most}} of {{machining}} processes, chip morphology and microstructure contain deep information about the cutting mechanisms, their evolution and, even, about both {{the process and the}} <b>workpiece.</b> However, usually, <b>changes</b> in the process are related only to changes in the tool morphology and in the surface integrity hiding relevant information. This is commonly due to the chip characterization is not an easy task. In effect, chip geometry and dimensional features are habitually hardly measurable and evaluable. In this work, a methodology for characterizing the chip developed in the dry turning processes of Titanium alloys (Ti 6 Al 4 V - UNS R 56400) has been proposed. This characterization has been achieved by considering different geometrical and dimensional parameters. Thus, shrinkage parameter has been evaluated through the changes in length and compared with the corresponding values determined through variations measured in thickness and width. However, the partially discontinuous form of the Ti chips makes difficult the dimensional evaluation. Stereoscopic Optical Microscopy (SOM) techniques can help to evaluate the chip shrinkage parameter through the measurement of the shear angle. In parallel, SOM techniques can assist for measuring other geometrical parameters of the chip. In this context, the evolution of the shrinkage parameter with the length of machining and the changes of the chip geometry with the cutting parameters (cutting speed and feed) has been also analyzed...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} numerical {{and experimental}} investigations into Electrochemical Machining (ECM). The {{aim is to}} develop a computer program to predict the shape of a workpiece machined by the ECM process. The program is able to simulate various applications of EC machining which are drilling, milling, turning and shaped tube electrochemical drilling (STED). The program has been developed in a MATLAB environment. In this present work, EC-drilling, EC-milling and EC-turning are analysed as three-dimensional problems whereas STED is simulated in two-dimensions. Experiments have been carried out to verify the accuracy of the predicted results in the cases of EC-milling and EC-turning. The ECM modeller is based on the boundary element method (BEM) and uses Laplace's equation to determine the current distribution at nodes on the workpiece surface. In 3 D, the surfaces of the tool and the workpiece are discretised into continuous linear triangular element types whereas in 2 D, the boundaries of the tool and workpiece are discretised into linear elements. The ECM modeller is completely self-contained, i. e. it does not rely on any other commercial package. The program contains modules to automatically discretize the surfaces/boundaries of the tool and workpiece. Since the simulation of the ECM process is a temporal problem, several time steps are required to obtain the final workpiece shape. At the end of each time step, the shape of the workpiece is calculated using Faraday's laws. However, the <b>workpiece's</b> shape <b>changes</b> with progressing time steps causing the elements to become stretched and distorted. Mesh refinement techniques are built in the ECM modeller, and these subdivide the mesh automatically when necessary. The effect of time step on the predicted 3 D shape of a hole in EC-drilling is investigated. The effect of discontinuity in the slope between neighbouring elements is also studied. Results obtained from the ECM modeller are compared with 2 D analytical results to verify the accuracy that can be obtained from the ECM modeller. Milling features ranging from a simple slot to a pocket with a complex protrusion were machined {{in order to determine the}} feasibility of the EC milling process. These features were machined on a 3 -axes CNC machine converted to permit EC milling. The effect of tool geometry, tool feed rate, applied voltage and step-over distances on the dimensions, shape and surface finish of the machined features were investigated. A pocket with a human shape protrusion was machined using two different types of tool paths, namely contour-parallel and zig-zag. Both types resulted in the base surface of the pocket being concave and the final dimensions of the pockets are compared with the design drawing to determine the effect of tool path type on the accuracy of machining. The ECM modeller was used to simulate the machining of a thin-walled turned component. The machining parameters, i. e. initial gap, rotational speed, and applied voltage, were specified by the collaborating company. Since only a small amount of material had to be removed from the thin-walled component, the tool was held stationary i. e. a feed in the radial or longitudinal direction was not required. By taking advantage of the axi-symmetric nature of a turned component, only a sector of the component was analysed thereby reducing the computing time considerably. The accuracy of the modeller was verified by comparing the predicted time to machine the thin-walled component with the actual machining time. The initial investigations in STED were both experimental and numerical in nature and they studied the effect of applied voltage, tool feed rate and electrolyte pressure on the dimensions of the holes. Later investigations were numerical and an iterative methodology has been developed to calculate a set of feed rates which could machine a specified turbulator shape.
