At system level, a two-phase switching is employed to lower the inductor current ripple so that both the output ripple and power loss are reduced.

40|$|Since the {{invention}} of the Erbium-doped fiber amplifier in 1987 and the preceding advances in low-loss single-mode fiber technology, fiber optic wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) has been the dominant technology of long-haul data transmission in the 1. 55 -mm region. Modern dense WDM (DWDM) systems can utilize more than 60 transmission channels in the C-band (1530 - 1570 nm) with a channel spacing of only 25 GHz. The combination of high modulation frequencies and small channel spacing place stringent requirements on the wavelength accuracy and long-term stability of the transmitting lasers. This Thesis presents simple inexpensive means for referencing and monitoring the channel wavelengths with wavelength references based on solid silicon Fabry-Perot resonators. The precise temperature control of the resonators enables both long-term stability for reproducible locking of lasers and fast sweeps to measure laser wavelengths. By employing unique pilot tones, the wavelengths and power levels of WDM channels can be directly measured from the optical multiplex of the transmission fiber. In photonic bandgap fibers, a class of photonic crystal fibers, most of the light intensity is guided in the air capillaries of the fiber. This provides the possibility to fill the capillaries with a gas, such as acetylene or methane, having suitable absorption bands coinciding with optical transmission frequencies. The Thesis presents practical applications utilizing these gas-filled fibers as miniature high-resolution absorption cells to provide references for calibrating secondary reference artifacts and measurement instruments. Moreover, multiple absorption lines of acetylene are shown to coincide with standardized DWDM transmission frequencies with adequate accuracy to be used as direct references for the transmission lasers.

40|$|There is an {{increased}} demand on {{efficient use of}} frequency spectrum required by the modern wireless communication systems. As we are facing an explosion of information data transmission, that is estimated to grow exponentially {{in the next few}} years, multiband and ultrawideband systems are the realistic solutions to follow. As a result, reconfigurable systems are of significant importance and are investigated in numerous research centers. In this thesis, novel designs based on radio frequency micro-electro-mechanical systems (RF MEMS) that can lead to the reconfigurable wireless transceivers are proposed. Different RF MEMS approaches were investigated. Electrostatic RF MEMS were selected as the base of all our designs due to the important factors such as low power consumption and small physical sizes and volumes. Several RF MEMS devices were designed, simulated, fabricated and measured. These include single-pole single throw switches, multiport switches and switch matrices. Special structures such as scalable matrices and reconfigurable filter have also been designed and implemented. &# 149; Several electrostatically actuated RF MEMS switches were designed, modeled, simulated and fabricated. Major problems such as high actuation and low fabrication yield due to residue stress in RF MEMS were investigated and tackled. A new simplified closed form model to analytically calculate spring constant of laterally meandered beam is introduced. A methodology is demonstrated to show reduction of directional stress sensitivity by introducing inline dimple lines. A numerical approach on calculating the spring constant of a vertically corrugated beam is shown. The designed RF MEMS switches achieved good RF performance concomitant with good mechanical characteristics. All <b>switches</b> developed achieved <b>wideband</b> operation from DC to 40 GHz with less than 0. 7 dB insertion loss and 20 dB return loss. &# 149; An RF MEMS T-type switch for redundancy switch matrix applications is introduced for the first time. The T-type switch is capable of performing all the operations as from other technologies. Novel RF circuits were designed to be used for the implementation in the switch. These include: RF crossover, 90 degree turns and four-port cross junctions. The T-type switch measured RF performance that outmatches all existing technologies. The measured results for the entire T-type switch demonstrate an insertion loss of 1. 5 dB, a return loss of better than 20 dB and isolation higher than 28 dB for all states for frequencies up to 30 GHz. To our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} an RF MEMS T-type switch has ever been reported. &# 149; New solutions for implementing <b>wideband</b> large <b>switch</b> matrices were demonstrated. These solutions are based on crossbar and L-shaped matrix topologies. Unit cell design approaches were taking into consideration to achieve scalability in the matrix order and enhancement on RF performance. A 3 × 3 crossbar and a 4 × 4 L-shaped switch matrix were designed as prove of concepts. Both designs achieved ultrawideband performance. The devices can operate up to 40 GHz without much RF performance compensations. We have reduced up to 98 % overall device size compared to some previous RF switch matrices.

40|$|A power {{distribution}} system (PDS) delivers electrical power to a load safely and effectively in a pre-determined format. Here format refers to necessary voltages, current levels and time variation of either {{as required by the}} empowered system. This formatting is usually referred as "conditioning". The research reported in this dissertation presents a complete system focusing on low power energy harvesting, conditioning, storage and regulation. Energy harvesting is a process by which ambient energy present in the environment is captured and converted to electrical energy. In recent years, it has become a prominent research area in multiple disciplines. Several energy harvesting schemes have been exploited in the literature, including solar energy, mechanic energy, radio frequency (RF) energy, thermal energy, electromagnetic energy, biochemical energy, radioactive energy and so on. Different from the large scale energy generation, energy harvesting typically operates in milli-watts or even micro-watts power levels. Almost all energy harvesting schemes require stages of power conditioning and intermediate storage - batteries or capacitors that reservoir energy harvested from the environment. Most of the ambient energy fluctuates and is usually weak. The purpose of power conditioning is to adjust the format of the energy to be further used, and intermediate storage smoothes out the impact of the fluctuations on the power delivered to the load. This dissertation reports an end to end {{power distribution}} system that integrates different functional blocks including energy harvesting, power conditioning, energy storage, output regulation and system control. We studied and investigated different energy harvesting schemes and the dissertation places emphasis on radio frequency energy harvesting. This approach {{has proven to be a}} viable power source for low-power electronics. However, it is still challenging to obtain significant amounts of energy rapidly and efficiently from the ambient. Available RF power is usually very weak, leading to low voltage applied to the electronics. The power delivered to the PDS is hard to utilize or store. This dissertation presents a configuration including a <b>wideband</b> rectenna, a <b>switched</b> capacitor voltage boost converter and a thin film flexible battery cell that can be re-charged at an exceptionally low voltage. We demonstrate that the system is able to harvest energy from a commercially available hand-held communication device at an overall efficiency as high as 7. 7 %. Besides the RF energy harvesting block, the whole PDS includes a solar energy harvesting block, a USB recharging block, a customer selection block, two battery arrays, a control block and an output block. The functions of each of the blocks have been tested and verified. The dissertation also studies and investigates several potential applications of this PDS. The applications we exploited include an ultra-low power tunable neural oscillator, wireless sensor networks (WSNs), medical prosthetics and small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). We prove that it is viable to power these potential loads through energy harvesting from multiple sources...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of new communication standards has put a key challenge for semiconductor industry to develop RF devices that can handle high power and high data rates simultaneously. The RF devices {{play a key role}} in the design of power amplifiers (PAs), which is considered as a heart of base-station. From economical point of view, a single wideband RF power module is more desirable rather than multiple narrowband PAs especially for multi-band and multi-mode operation. Therefore, device modeling has now become much more crucial for such applications. In order to reduce the device design cycle time, the researchers also heavily rely on computer aided design (CAD) tools. With improvement in CAD technology the model extraction has become more accurate and device physical structure optimization can be carried out with less number of iterations. LDMOS devices have been dominating in the communication field since last decade and are still widely used for PA design and development. This thesis deals with the optimization of RFLDMOS transistor and its evaluation in different PA classes, such as linear, <b>switching,</b> <b>wideband</b> and multi-band applications. For accurate evaluation of RF-LDMOS transistor parameters, some techniques are also developed in technology CAD (TCAD) using large signal time domain computational load-pull (CLP) methods. Initially the RF-LDMOS is studied in TCAD for the improved RF performance. The physical intrinsic structure of RF-LDMOS is provided by Infenion Technologies AG. A reduced surface field (RESURF) of low-doped drain (LDD) region is considered in detail because it plays an important role in RF-LDMOS devices to obtain high breakdown voltage (BVDS). But on the other hand, it also reduces the RF performance due to high on-resistance (Ron). The excess interface state charges at the RESURF region are introduced to reduce the Ron, which not only increases the dc drain current, but also improve the RF performance in terms of power, gain and efficiency. The important achievement is the enhancement in operating frequency up to 4 GHz. In LDD region, the effect of excess interface charges at the RESURF is also compared with dual implanted-layer of p-type and n-type. The comparison revealed that the former provides 43 % reduction in Ron with BVDS of 70 V, while the later provides 26 % reduction in Ron together with BVDS of 64 - 68 V. In the second part of my research work, computational load pull (CLP) simulation technique is used in TCAD to extract the impedances of RF-LDMOS at different frequencies under large signal operation. Flexible matching is an issue in the design of broadband or multi-band PAs. Optimum impedance of RF-LDMOS is extracted at operating frequencies of 1, 2 and 2. 5 GHz in class AB PA. After this, CLP simulation technique is further developed in TCAD to study the non-linear behavior of RF devices. Through modified CLP technique, non-linear effects inside the transistor structure are studied by conventional two-tone RF signals in time domain. This is helpful to detect and understand the phenomena, which can be resolved to improve the device performance. The third order inter-modulation distortion (IMD 3) of RF- LDMOS was observed at different power levels. The IMD 3 of − 22 dBc is obtained at 1 -dB compression point (P 1 -dB), while at 10 dB back off the value increases to − 36 dBc. These results were also verified experimentally by fabricating a linear PA. Similarly, CLP technique is developed further for the analysis of RF devices in high efficiency operation by investigating the odd harmonic effects for the design of class-F PA. RF-LDMOS can provide a power added efficiency (PAE) of 81. 2 % in class-F PA at 1 GHz in TCAD simulations. The results are verified by design and fabrication of class-F PA using large signal model of the similar device in ADS. In fabrication, a PAE of 76 % is achieved...|$|R
