5|$|A relict species nearly exterminated by {{the last}} ice age, box {{huckleberry}} is self-sterile, and is found in isolated colonies which reproduce clonally by extending roots. One colony in Pennsylvania was once estimated to {{be as many as}} 13,000 years old; more recent estimates have an upper bound of about 8,000 years, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> the oldest woody plant east of the Rocky Mountains. Another colony in Pennsylvania, about 1,300 years old, has been protected by the Hoverter and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area.|$|E

5|$|The Castaing {{machine is}} a device used to add {{lettering}} and decoration {{to the edge}} of a coin. Such lettering was necessitated by counterfeiting and edge clipping, which was a common problem resulting from the uneven and irregular hammered coinage. When Aubin Olivier introduced milled coinage to France, he also developed a method of marking the edges with lettering <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> possible to detect if metal had been shaved from the edge. This method involved using a collar, into which the metal flowed from the pressure of the press. This technique was slower and more costly than later methods. France abandoned milled coinage in favour of hammering in 1585.|$|E
5|$|The King's School, Canterbury claims Augustine as its founder, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> the world's oldest {{existing}} school, but {{the first}} documentary records of the school date from the 16th century. Augustine did establish a school, and soon after his death Canterbury was able to send teachers out to support the East Anglian mission. Augustine received liturgical books from the pope, but their exact contents are unknown. They {{may have been some}} of the new mass books that were being written at this time. The exact liturgy that Augustine introduced to England remains unknown, {{but it would have been}} a form of the Latin language liturgy in use at Rome.|$|E
5|$|The {{tawny owl}} {{is a member}} of the wood-owl genus Strix, part of the typical owl family Strigidae, which {{contains}} all species of owl other than the barn owls. Within its genus, the tawny owl's closest relatives are Hume's owl, Strix butleri, (formerly considered to be conspecific), the Himalayan owl, Strix nivicolum, (sometimes considered conspecific), its larger northern neighbour, the Ural owl, S. uralensis, and the North American barred owl, S. varia. The Early–Middle Pleistocene Strix intermedia is sometimes considered a paleosubspecies of the tawny owl, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> that species' immediate ancestor.|$|E

5|$|While Dürr {{assumes that}} Bach first {{performed}} the cantata on 15 July 1714, other scholars arrive at different dates. John Eliot Gardiner and others assume Oculi that year <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> the earliest cantata performed after the promotion. It {{is his first}} extant church cantata for a solo voice, followed by , for soprano. The cantata {{is the first of}} four written for a single alto soloist, the others, all composed in 1726, being , Vergnügte Ruh, beliebte Seelenlust, BWV 170, and , BWV 169, two of which also have texts by Lehms.|$|E
5|$|Allosauridae {{is one of}} four {{families}} in Carnosauria; the other three are Neovenatoridae, Carcharodontosauridae and Sinraptoridae. Allosauridae has at times been proposed as ancestral to the Tyrannosauridae (<b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> paraphyletic), one recent example being Gregory S. Paul's Predatory Dinosaurs of the World, but this has been rejected, with tyrannosaurids identified as members of a separate branch of theropods, the Coelurosauria. Allosauridae is the smallest of the carnosaur families, with only Saurophaganax and a currently unnamed French allosauroid accepted as possible valid genera besides Allosaurus in the most recent review. Another genus, Epanterias, is a potential valid member, but it and Saurophaganax {{may turn out to be}} large examples of Allosaurus. Recent reviews have kept the genus Saurophaganax and included Epanterias with Allosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Haumea is a plutoid, a dwarf planet beyond Neptune's orbit. It is {{classified}} as a dwarf planet because it is presumed to be massive enough to have been rounded by its own gravity into a shape in hydrostatic equilibrium, but not massive enough to have cleared its neighbourhood of similarly sized objects. Haumea was initially listed as a classical Kuiper belt object in 2006 by the Minor Planet Center, but no longer. The nominal trajectory suggests that Haumea is in a weak 7:12 orbital resonance with Neptune, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> a resonant object instead. Although there are precovery images of Haumea dating back to March 22, 1955 from the Palomar Mountain Digitized Sky Survey, further observations of the orbit {{will be required to}} verify its dynamic status.|$|E

5|$|Rockstar San Diego {{began to}} develop Red Dead Redemption in 2005. Development was {{conducted}} {{by a team of}} more than 800 people, including Rockstar San Diego's core team and staff from parent company Rockstar Games's studios around the world. The game runs on the proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE), which was improved for the game to improve its draw distance rendering capabilities. The Euphoria and Bullet software handle additional animation and rendering tasks. Having exhausted the use of previous hardware on previous projects, Rockstar felt inspired after realising the potential power of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Analyst estimations place the game's combined development and marketing budget between US$80 million and US$100 million, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> {{one of the most expensive}} video games ever made.|$|E
5|$|Sedna has a V-band {{absolute}} magnitude (H) of about 1.8, {{and it is}} estimated to have an albedo of about 0.32, thus giving it a diameter of approximately 1,000km. At {{the time of its}} discovery it was the intrinsically brightest object found in the Solar System since Pluto in 1930. In 2004, the discoverers placed an upper limit of 1,800km on its diameter, but by 2007 this was revised downward to less than 1,600km after observation by the Spitzer Space Telescope. In 2012, measurements from the Herschel Space Observatory suggested that Sedna's diameter was , <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> smaller than Pluto's moon Charon. Because Sedna has no known moons, determining its mass is currently impossible without sending a space probe. Sedna is currently the largest trans-Neptunian Sun-orbiting object not known to possess a satellite.|$|E
5|$|All {{roentgenium}} isotopes {{are extremely}} unstable and radioactive; in general, the heavier isotopes are {{more stable than}} the lighter. The most stable known roentgenium isotope, 282Rg, is also the heaviest known roentgenium isotope; it has a half-life of 2.1minutes. (The unconfirmed 286Rg is even heavier and appears to have an even longer half-life of about 11minutes, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> one of the longest-lived superheavy nuclides known.) The isotopes 280Rg and 281Rg have also been reported to have half-lives over a second. The remaining isotopes have half-lives in the millisecond range. The undiscovered isotope 287Rg has been predicted {{to be the most}} stable towards beta decay; however, no known roentgenium isotope has been observed to undergo beta decay. The unknown isotopes 277Rg and 283Rg are also expected to have long half-lives of 1second and 10minutes respectively. Before their discovery, the isotopes 278Rg, 281Rg, and 282Rg were predicted to have long half-lives of 1second, 1minute, and 4minutes respectively; however, they were discovered to have shorter half-lives of 4.2milliseconds, 17seconds, and 2.1minutes respectively.|$|E

5|$|Although {{beyond their}} jurisdiction, the Navigation commissioners {{attempted}} {{to extend their}} powers, to improve the river below the junction with Aike Beck. They particularly wanted to replace the stone Hull Bridge, near Beverley, with a swing bridge, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> easier for keels to reach Frodingham bridge. The Corporation of Beverley objected, because the bridge was the main route of communication between Beverley and Holderness, and the commissioners instead dredged parts of the river to improve access. Plans to improve Hull Bridge were again resisted by Beverley Corporation in 1799, but an agreement was finally reached in 1801, and an Act of Parliament was obtained in July of that year. William Chapman acted as engineer, as the act authorised the construction of towpaths, a new cut between Bethels Bridge and the lock at Struncheon Hill, to avoid a long loop in the river, and rebuilding of the bridge. The bridge cost £500, half of which was met by Richard Bethell, {{the owner of the}} Leven Canal, on condition that the tolls for passing through it were reduced significantly.|$|E
5|$|Team Bondi {{began to}} develop L.A. Noire {{following}} their founding in 2004. Initially due {{to be published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment, the publishing rights were later handed over to Rockstar Games in September 2006. Though Team Bondi oversaw development, the work was shared between Team Bondi and multiple Rockstar studios around the world. Unlike other games by Rockstar, which run on their proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine, L.A. Noire uses a custom engine, which includes a combination of facial motion capture and animation software. The game is notable for being the first to use MotionScan, developed by Depth Analysis. MotionScan functions by recording actors with 32 surrounding cameras to capture facial expressions from every angle, resulting in a highly realistic recreation of a human face. The technology is central to the game's interrogation mechanic, as players are required to use the suspects' reactions to questioning to judge {{whether or not they are}} lying. Analyst estimations place the game's combined development and marketing budget at more than US $50 million, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> one of the most expensive video games ever made.|$|E
5|$|The strict {{definition}} of Heinrich events is the climatic event causing the IRD layer observed in marine sediment cores from the North Atlantic: a massive collapse of northern hemisphere ice shelves {{and the consequent}} release of a prodigious volume of icebergs. By extension, the name Heinrich events can also refer to the associated climatic anomalies registered at other places around the globe, at approximately the same time periods. The events are rapid: they last probably less than a millennium, a duration varying from one event to the next, and their abrupt onset may occur in mere years (Maslin et al. 2001). Heinrich events are clearly observed in many North Atlantic marine sediment cores covering the last glacial period; the lower resolution of the sedimentary record before this point {{makes it more difficult}} to deduce whether they occurred during other glacial periods in the Earth's history. Some (Broecker 1994, Bond & Lotti 1995) identify the Younger Dryas event as a Heinrich event, <b>which</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> event H0 (table, right).|$|E
