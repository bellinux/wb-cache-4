25|$|When the Civil War {{ended in}} 1865 he {{returned}} to Memphis, Tennessee, where he resumed his pre-war business affairs. In 1866 he married Hayes Dunn, with whom he would have three daughters, and shortly thereafter changed the spelling of his name to Fizer, reasoning that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> had sounded all his life. Three streets in Memphis were later named after him, all using this spelling. He also became {{a partner in a}} large and successful cotton brokerage firms and actively participated in local Democratic politics.|$|E
25|$|The {{major shift}} in medical {{thinking}} was the gradual rejection, especially during the Black Death in the 14th and 15th centuries, {{of what may be}} called the 'traditional authority' approach to science and medicine. This was the notion that because some prominent person in the past said something must be so, then that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> was, and anything one observed to the contrary was an anomaly (which was paralleled by a similar shift in European society in general – see Copernicus's rejection of Ptolemy's theories on astronomy). Physicians like Vesalius improved upon or disproved some of the theories from the past. The main tomes used both by medicine students and expert physicians were Materia Medica and Pharmacopoeia.|$|E

25|$|An {{interesting}} side-effect of Ethiopian Christianity <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> intersected with {{a belief}} that had long prevailed in Europe {{of the existence of}} a Christian kingdom in the far east, whose monarch was known as Prester John. Originally thought to have been in the Orient, eventually the search for Prester John's mythical kingdom focused on Africa and particularly, the Christian empire in Ethiopia. This was first noticed when Zara Yaqob sent delegates to the Council of Florence in order to establish ties with the papacy and Western Christianity. They were confused when they arrived and council prelates insisted on calling their monarch Prester John, trying to explain that nowhere in Zara Yaqob's list of regnal names did that title occur. However, the delegates' admonitions did little to stop Europeans from referring to the monarch as their mythical Christian king, Prester John.|$|E

500|$|After {{playing for}} the San Juan Senators in Puerto Rico, Doby rejoined the Eagles in 1946. He made the All-Star roster, batted [...]360 (fourth in the NNL), hit five home runs (fifth) and led the NNL in triples (six). Manager Biz Mackey led the Eagles, {{including}} Doby, Monte Irvin and Johnny Davis, to the Negro World Series championship over Satchel Paige and the Kansas City Monarchs in seven games to conclude the 1946 season. For the Series, Doby hit [...]372 with one home run, five RBIs, and three stolen bases. Many in the Negro leagues believed Doby or Irvin would be first to break the MLB color barrier, not Robinson. On considering {{a career in the}} MLB, Doby said, [...] "I never dreamed that far ahead. Growing up in a segregated society, you couldn't have thought that that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> was going to be.

But we wanted to get out there and drive and put on a show. Delaying it every half an hour <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> had to be." [...] During the waiting period on Saturday, many teams had engaged in tomfoolery in the paddock to entertain the crowds, such as bowling or ballroom dancing between Red Bull teammates Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat. Ferrari later condemned the behaviour of their fellow teams, with team principal Maurizio Arrivabene saying: [...] "We are a Formula One team, not the Cirque du Soleil."

2500|$|In 1827, Schubert {{wrote the}} song cycle Winterreise (D. 911), a colossal peak in art song ("remarkable" [...] <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> was {{described}} at the Schubertiades), the Fantasy in C major for violin and piano (D. 934, first published as op. post. 159), the Impromptus for piano, {{and the two}} piano trios (the first in B-flat major (D. 898), and the second in E-flat major, (D. 929); in 1828 the cantata Mirjams Siegesgesang (Victory Song of Miriam, D 942) on a text by Franz Grillparzer, the Mass in E-flat major (D. 950), the Tantum Ergo (D. 962) in the same key, the String Quintet in C major (D. 956), the second [...] "Benedictus" [...] to the Mass in C major (D. 452), the three final piano sonatas (D. 958, D. 959, and D. 960), and the song cycle 13 Lieder nach Gedichten von Rellstab und Heine for voice and piano, also known as Schwanengesang (Swan-song, D. 957). This collection, while not a true song cycle, retains a unity amongst the individual songs, touching depths of tragedy and of the morbidly supernatural, which had rarely been plumbed by any composer in the century preceding it. Six of these are set to words by Heinrich Heine, whose Buch der Lieder appeared in the autumn. The Symphony in C major (D. 944) is dated 1828, but Schubert scholars believe that this symphony was largely written in 1825–1826 (being referred to {{while he was on}} holiday at Gastein in 1825—that work, once considered lost, is now generally seen as an early stage of his C major symphony) and was revised for prospective performance in 1828. This was a fairly unusual practice for Schubert, for whom publication, let alone performance, was rarely contemplated for most of his larger-scale works during his lifetime. The huge, Beethovenian work was declared [...] "unplayable" [...] by a Viennese orchestra. In the last weeks of his life, he began to sketch three movements for a new Symphony in D major (D 936A).|$|E
