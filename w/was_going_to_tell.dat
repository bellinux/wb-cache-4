25|$|While {{appointed}} Prime Minister, {{the aftermath}} of the Portella della Ginestra massacre came to haunt Scelba again. On February 9, 1954, Gaspare Pisciotta was found dead in his cell. After Pisciotta had been sentenced to life in imprisonment and forced labour, he realized that he had been abandoned by all. He declared that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the whole truth, in particular who signed the letter which had been brought to Giuliano, which demanded the massacre at Portella delle Ginestra in exchange for liberty for the bandits and which Giuliano had destroyed immediately.|$|E
500|$|In 1967 {{when the}} Israeli nuclear program was nearing completion, Teller {{informed}} Neeman that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the CIA that Israel had built nuclear weapons, and explain {{that it was}} justified by {{the background of the}} Six-Day War. After Neeman cleared it with Prime Minister Levi Eshkol, Teller briefed the head of the CIA's Office of Science and Technology, Carl Duckett. It took a year for Teller to convince the CIA that Israel had obtained nuclear capability; the information then went through CIA Director Richard Helms to the president at that time, Lyndon B. Johnson. [...] Teller also persuaded them to end the American attempts to inspect the Negev Nuclear Research Center in Dimona. In 1976 Duckett testified in Congress before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, that after receiving information from [...] "American scientist", he drafted a National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Israel's nuclear capability.|$|E
500|$|During Russ' trial, Mercedes {{decided to}} go to the court to testify for him due to Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox), who {{explained}} to Mercedes that her sister died because Justin Burton (Chris Fountain) was [...] "too gutless to come forward and tell the truth". This encouraged Mercedes to [...] "take a long, hard look at herself", and she realised that she was doing the same thing in the situation with Warren. On her way to the court however, Mercedes was [...] "all over the place". According to Metcalfe, everyone was shocked when Mercedes walked into the courtroom. She said that Mercedes was unsure of what she <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the court, [...] "but her alibi is vital to Warren's case - his fate lies in her hands". Metcalfe said that even if Mercedes and Russ ended their relationship, which they did shortly after she confessed the truth, would not matter because she believed that it would not take Mercedes [...] "long before she goes back to her old ways" [...] because [...] "that's just the type of person she is - Mercedes likes playing the field and having fun, and no man's going to change her" ...|$|E

500|$|... "Watch n' Learn" [...] {{was written}} by Priscilla Renea, Chauncey Hollis, Rihanna and Alja Jackson. The {{production}} of the song was helmed by Hollis under his stage-name Hit-Boy. Hollis had previously worked with music artists like Lil Wayne, The Throne, Eminem and Jennifer Lopez. [...] "Watch n' Learn" [...] wasn't originally meant for any particular artist when Hit-Boy started to work on it. In an interview with Jocelyn Vena from MTV News he explained: [...] "I was at the studio with this amazing [...] Priscilla Renea, and I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her to go home, but I was like, 'Stay here {{and see if you}} could come up with an idea for this '". Renea previously penned Rihanna's 2011 single [...] "California King Bed" [...] (Loud, 2010). Hollis further explained that by the time he left the studio and came home, Renea already sent him the idea and concept for the song through IChat. He was eventually satisfied with it and sent the song to Rihanna, in which her team [...] "went crazy" [...] when they heard it. [...] Rihanna then recorded the song for inclusion on her sixth studio album Talk That Talk (2011).|$|E
2500|$|The Doctor's {{relationship}} with Rose intensifies after he regenerates into the Tenth Doctor. In [...] "New Earth", Rose's body is temporarily inhabited by Cassandra, who kisses the Doctor romantically. This {{is one of}} the few scenes in the entire programme where the Doctor is kissed romantically by his companion. In [...] "School Reunion", the arrival of the Doctor's previous companion Sarah Jane Smith and his reaction to seeing her again prompts jealousy and worry from Rose, and Sarah all but admits that she has long been in love with the Doctor. The Doctor also expresses dismay at having his companions age while he regenerates. In the episode, [...] "The Girl in the Fireplace" [...] (written by Steven Moffat), the Doctor falls in love with Madame de Pompadour, with whom he shares a passionate kiss and a strong romantic connection. She even takes him away to [...] "dance", but how far the metaphor (coined in the episode [...] "The Doctor Dances") is taken is not seen on screen. Rose does not openly exhibit jealousy towards Madame de Pompadour. In the novel The Stone Rose, by Jacqueline Rayner, the Doctor kisses Rose after she saves him from being petrified, although it is described as [...] "a kiss of gratitude and joy and unspeakable pleasure at being alive." [...] In [...] "The Impossible Planet" [...] the Doctor and Rose share an awkward moment when they have to consider settling down in one time period and Rose suggests they do so together. She later plants a kiss for good luck on the Doctor's spacesuit prior to his descent into the pit. In [...] "The Satan Pit" [...] the Doctor, fearing for his life, tells someone [...] "If you see Rose, tell her... tell her... oh, she knows". In [...] "Doomsday", when the Doctor says his goodbye to Rose, she finally tells him that she loves him. He begins to reply, but the message is cut off, and he is unable to reciprocate; in the episode's audio commentary, executive producer Julie Gardner had stated that [...] "he absolutely was going to say it... he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> her he loved her." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following Jacob & Sharon's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Do You Know Your Partner?" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, Big Brother 8 HouseGuests Eric Stein and Jessica Hughbanks {{returned}} to host. The HouseGuests were required {{to answer questions about}} their partners preferences in a relationship; the team with the most points {{at the end of the}} competition would be the winner. Alex & Amanda were the winners, becoming the first couple to win Head of Household. Fearing Allison <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the house about Jen and Ryan's relationship, Jen & Parker decided to tell the other HouseGuests about their relationship. Though believing the others would appreciate their honesty, the HouseGuests were upset by their relationship. Following this, Alex & Amanda and Matt & Natalie formed an alliance, vowing to be the last remaining couples. Allison and Sheila, believing Allison would be evicted that week, lied to Joshuah and Chelsia stating that they were a lesbian couple, and had known each other before entering the house. On Day 7, Alex & Amanda chose to nominate Allison & Ryan and Jen & Parker for eviction. Later that day, Neil chose to walk from the game due to an unspecified urgent personal matter; Joshuah was given the option to bring either Jacob or Sharon back as his partner, and he chose Sharon. When picking the fourth couple to compete for the Power of Veto competition, Matt & Natalie were selected to compete; Joshuah was selected to host. On Day 9, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "In Sickness and in Health" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, one member of each couple was strapped to a spinning heart while holding onto a button. Their partner was required to spin the heart, and the first couple to reach three-hundred spins without letting go of their button would be the winning couple. Matt & Natalie were the winners of the Power of Veto. On Day 11, Matt & Natalie chose to not to use the Power of Veto on either nominated couple. On Day 14, Jen & Parker became the second couple to be evicted from the house in a vote of three to one.|$|E
