2500|$|On September 9, 2015, Clinton apologized {{during an}} ABC News {{interview}} {{for using the}} private server, saying she was [...] "sorry for that." [...] Appearing on NBC's Meet the Press on September 27, 2015, Clinton defended her use of the private email server while she was secretary of state, comparing the investigations to Republican-led probes of her husband's presidential administration {{more than two decades}} ago, saying, [...] "It is like a drip, drip, drip. And that's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> there's only so much that I can control".|$|E
2500|$|Former New Zealand All Blacks wing Stu Wilson {{writes in}} the tribute book David Campese that, [...] "When asked by a {{television}} reporter if he {{was looking forward to}} mark Stu Wilson he replied, 'Stu who?'" [...] Campese responded in the same book by replying that, [...] "The story is true, but Stu misunderstood <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> it. I didn't say it because I was cocky. I said it because I honestly did not know who Stu Wilson was. I was a nineteen-year-old boy from Queanbeyan. My background had been in rugby league, not rugby union." ...|$|E
60|$|I don't know <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> it. It wasn't what I {{meant to}} say. I'm not sure I {{meant to say}} anything.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> {{nothing about}} it," [...] replied the doctor coolly, --"because of my {{consideration}} for his orphan child." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just because I am a gentleman, I {{have not}} accused her; but held my tongue, and spoken {{to you in}} confidence. Now, perhaps, you will {{understand}} <b>why</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> nothing to the Lieutenant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Monsieur Jesen," [...] he announced, [...] "I am no German {{maker of}} toys. Let me ascend {{with you to}} your room and you shall hear who <b>I</b> am and <b>why</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> these things to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Polly {{passed his}} hand over his brow. [...] "I had a most curious sensation. Felt exactly as though {{something}} was up somewhere. That's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> Little Dog. All right now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be alarmed; {{it was my}} duty. I can say no {{more about}} it now, but when it is over I will {{tell you exactly what}} I said, and <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Right ho, Jeeves. So {{much for}} that, then. Now here's {{something}} else: You noticed that I said I {{was going to}} put this project through tomorrow, and no doubt you wondered <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> tomorrow. Why did I, Jeeves?" ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2011's {{interview}} for Prog-Sphere.com, LaBrie {{stated that the}} US tour got cancelled, saying [...] "Because it was so disorganized last time. That's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> basically <b>said,</b> 'You don't have the visas yet. Where we're at this point, {{by the time you}} get the visas processed, we're gonna have one rehearsal and then we're gonna go out.' And <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'I'm not doing that.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|He was now so well {{advanced}} in convalescence {{that it was}} deemed a most desirable thing to take him down into his native air. Marcia agreed to accompany him. 'I don't see <b>why</b> <b>I</b> shouldn't,' <b>said</b> she. 'An old friendless woman like me, and you an old friendless man.' ...|$|R
6000|$|How {{beautiful}} she looked, {{standing there}} with her eyes so near to mine! [...] "Tell me <b>why,</b> Edra?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> still with a lingering apprehension.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, it {{must not}} be so. I was wrong {{to say that you}} were bloody-minded. I cannot tell <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> so. I would not for worlds have you altered in anything;--except," [...] she said, [...] "in your love for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I do, and that's exactly <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> it. You see I'm not in {{the least}} {{delicate}} or graceful or shy about it--I just come out with it and defy you to contradict me. Who, if I'm not the best, is a better one?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we can't, an' {{it looks}} as if we might have to stay here a long while, unless they get the best of us. Nobody will think of coming to look for us for a good many hours, an' that's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> we were in a fix." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{a reason}} <b>why</b> <b>I</b> can't," [...] <b>said</b> Andy, sadly. [...] "There's {{a reason why}} he mustn't be there. Don't ask me what it is, for I can't tell you." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Bri. <b>Why,</b> child, <b>I</b> never <b>said</b> {{but that}} Lieutenant O'Connor {{was a very}} well-bred and discerning young man; 'tis your papa is so violent against him.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's exactly <b>why</b> <b>I</b> asked," [...] <b>said</b> <b>I.</b> [...] "The {{excessively}} modern tone of {{your language}} and idioms struck me, so to speak, {{as a sort}} of anachronism with your Restoration costume--an anachronism which I fancy I have noticed in many printed accounts of gentlemen from your portion of the universe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Besides, {{you will}} find your nightgown in my hiding-place, with the smear of the paint on it; and {{you will want to}} know how it came to be hidden by me? and <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> nothing to you about it in my life-time? I have only one reason to give. I did these strange things, because I loved you.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> it, Sweet," [...] he {{answered}} uneasily, and just then a little cloud floated over {{the face of the}} moon, darkening the world, and a cold wind blew down the kloof, causing its trees to rustle and chilling the pair, so that they clung closer to each other for comfort.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because you {{are within}} my reach again," [...] I said, taking her hand. She did not {{withdraw}} it. [...] "Because I love you, Mary, as truly as ever a man loved a woman. Because this treasure, these riches, sealed my lips. Now {{that they are}} gone I {{can tell you how}} I love you. That is <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'Thank God.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{said you}} had never {{asked her to marry}} you," [...] pursued Ann relentlessly; [...] "you wouldn't tell me <b>why.</b> You <b>said</b> <b>I</b> shouldn't understand." ...|$|R
60|$|She laughed, {{and left}} me. I {{was obliged to}} {{sit down on the}} stair--I trembled so. My own reply frightened me. I tried to find out <b>why</b> <b>I</b> had <b>said</b> Yes. <b>I</b> don't {{remember}} being conscious of meaning anything. It was as if somebody else had <b>said</b> Yes--not <b>I.</b> Perhaps I was provoked, and the word escaped me before I could stop it. Could I have stopped it? I don't know.|$|R
5000|$|Despite being {{popular with}} audiences, the record failed to chart. In a 2009 {{interview}} on the BBC series Imagine, Bassey stated:It was {{banned by the}} BBC, and <b>I</b> didn't know <b>why.</b> And <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'Why are they banning it?' And my manager said, well - the lyrics {{may have something to}} do with it - and <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'Yah? But what?' I didn't even know what it was about. I'd never sung a risqu√© song and I think they purposefully didn't tell me so that I could give it that innocence.|$|R
60|$|Yet {{there is}} not a wave or any violently {{agitated}} sea on which both these forms do not appear, the latter especially, after some time of storm, extends over their whole surfaces; the reader sees, therefore, <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that sea could only be painted by means of more or less dexterous conventionalisms, since two of its most enduring phenomena cannot be represented at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, {{he looks}} respectable enough, {{but for all}} that I don't fancy him. It may be that he regards us as rivals, and {{was only trying to}} find out where we {{intended}} to stop, and whether we were likely to spoil his trade. That was <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> what I did, so that he might perceive that we were not likely to interfere with him.|$|E
60|$|Papa {{has been}} telling me of your abusing my stanzas on Mrs. Hemans's death. I had a presentiment that you would: and behold, <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> nothing to you of them. Of course, I maintain, versus both you and papa, {{that they are very}} much to be admired: as well as {{everything}} else proceeding from or belonging to ME. Upon which principle, I hope you will admire George particularly.|$|E
5000|$|Ed Winchester, an American reporter. He beams at {{the camera}} {{introduces}} himself, [...] "Hi! I'm Ed Winchester!", in an upbeat voice. In his last appearance in Series 2 {{he appears to have}} been cut off as he then mentions Jesus straight after introducing himself. In one sketch, someone else introduced himself with [...] "Hi! I'm Ed Winchester!" [...] He later replied with [...] "No I'm not. <b>I</b> don't know <b>why</b> <b>I</b> just <b>said</b> that." [...] (Jeff Harding).|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} <b>why</b> <b>I</b> should," [...] <b>said</b> Henry, hastily and confusedly. [...] "It is only the girls and the babies that have things there--and--and Miss Fosbrook herself {{had been at the}} {{cupboard}} in the morning; why shouldn't she have left it undone herself, and the doors got open?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear fellow," [...] said Father Knickerbocker, {{a little}} testily I thought, [...] "I'm as {{democratic}} and as {{plain and simple}} as any man in this city. But {{when it comes to}} carrying a handbag in full sight of all this crowd, <b>why,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to Peter Stuyvesant about--about"--here a misty look seemed to come over the old gentleman's face--"about two hundred years ago, I'll be hanged if I will. It can't be done. It's not up to date." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'B'George, he said he'd have thief and swag {{both inside}} of three days --he did, by hokey! and that's {{just about a}} week ago. <b>Why,</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> {{at the time that}} no thief and no thief's pal {{was going to try to}} pawn or sell a thing where he knowed the {{pawnbroker}} could get both rewards by taking HIM into camp with the swag. It was the blessedest idea that ever I struck!" ...|$|E
6000|$|And I'll {{tell you}} <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Ha!" [...] Here was Jeeves making heavy weather about me wearing a {{perfectly}} ordinary white mess jacket, a garment not only tout ce qu'il y a de chic, but absolutely de rigueur, {{and in the}} same breath, as you might say, inciting Gussie Fink-Nottle to be a blot on the London scene in scarlet tights. Ironical, what? One looks askance at this sort of in-and-out running.|$|E
6000|$|... ¬ß XII. Shipping may be introduced, or rich fancy of vestments, crowns, and ornaments, {{exactly on}} the same {{conditions}} as architecture; and if the reader will look back to my definition of the picturesque in the [...] "Seven Lamps," [...] he will see <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> above, that they might only be prominent when {{the purpose of the}} subject was partly picturesque; that is to say, when the mind is intended to derive part of its enjoyment from the parasitical qualities and accidents of the thing, not from the heart of the thing itself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} <b>why</b> <b>I</b> came," [...] <b>said</b> the famous {{physician}} to Dr. Abraham Rowell of Tarleton, [...] "I never shall know. There is something about that man Jethro Bass which compels you to do his will. He has a most extraordinary personality. Is this storekeeper a great friend of his?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{offers a}} {{thousand}} gold florins," [...] he muttered, [...] "in addition to Gonzaga's liberty and advancement. <b>Why,</b> then, <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> {{no more than}} was true when I assured the men that Gian Maria was but idly threatening us with bombardment. Keep this matter secret, Peppe." ...|$|R
40|$|In May I {{went to the}} Cornell Biological Field Station {{with nine}} volunteers from Maine to attend the pilot {{training}} for the National 4 -H Sportfishing Program. While I was there, Ron Howard, chair of the program development committee, asked if I was coming to this meeting, and if so, would I speak about the sportfishing program. In the euphoria of the moment, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> yes, then immediately began to wonder <b>why</b> <b>I</b> had <b>said</b> yes. Although <b>I</b> live more than 50 miles from here, I am giving this talk without slides and I haven 2 ÃÜ 7 t been fishing for over 25 years, so I hardly qualify as an expert...|$|R
