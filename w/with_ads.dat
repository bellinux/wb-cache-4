40|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) is {{a chronic}} inflammatory skin disorder. Patients <b>with</b> <b>AD</b> often experience psychological distress and poor health-related {{quality of life}} (HRQoL). The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the association of several psychological health statuses and poor HRQoL in an adult population <b>with</b> <b>AD</b> in South Korea. A total of 37, 578 adults who participated in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationwide, population-based, cross-sectional health survey between 2008 and 2013 were included.

Methods—We consecutively recruited 206 normal elderly, 121 patients <b>with</b> <b>AD,</b> 41 <b>with</b> FTLD, 20 with DLB, and 8 with VaD. We evaluated the 1 H MRS metabolite ratio changes in common dementias {{with respect to}} normal, and also differences among the common dementias. Results—N-acetylaspartate/Creatine (NAA/Cr) was lower than normal in patients <b>with</b> <b>AD,</b> FTLD, and VaD. Myo-inositol (mI) /Cr was higher than normal in patients <b>with</b> <b>AD</b> and FTLD. Choline (Cho) /Cr was higher than normal in patients <b>with,</b> <b>AD,</b> FTLD, and DLB. There were no metabolite differences between patients <b>with</b> <b>AD</b> and FTLD, nor between patients with DLB and VaD. NAA / Cr was lower in patients <b>with</b> <b>AD</b> and FTLD than DLB.

The objective of this study was, hence, to explore the role of these cognitive processes in groups of participants <b>with</b> <b>AD</b> <b>with</b> and without PDs, as well as a nonclinical comparison group. Method: Measures of attributional style and theory of mind were administered to three groups: people <b>with</b> <b>AD</b> and PDs (n = 22), people <b>with</b> <b>AD</b> without PDs (n = 22), and a nonclinical group (n = 23). Results: Although no clear differences in attributional style between the three groups were found, the group <b>with</b> <b>AD</b> and PDs were found to perform worse on the first-order (but not second-order) theory of mind task than the other two groups.

40|$|Background: Disproportionate medial {{temporal}} lobe atrophy (MTA) {{is an early}} finding in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Episodic memory impairment in <b>AD</b> is associated <b>with</b> the degree of MTA. Episodic memory impairment and MTA are also found in semantic dementia (SD) and in right {{temporal lobe}} atrophy (RTLA), the temporal variants of frontotemporal dementia, but their relationship is unclear. Objective: To compare episodic memory impairment among patients with these temporal variants of frontotemporal dementia with that of patients <b>with</b> <b>AD</b> <b>with</b> {{the same degree of}} MTA. Methods: Episodic memory was tested with the visual association test, and semantic memory (SM) with animal fluency and the visual association naming test. MTA was measured using a visual rating scale. Each patient with SD or RTLA was matched for MTA with two patients <b>with</b> <b>AD.</b> Comparisons of episodic memory and SM were made for patients with SD versus matched patients with AD; patients with RTLA versus matched patients <b>with</b> <b>AD</b> and for SD, RTLA and all patients <b>with</b> <b>AD.</b> Results: 27 patients with SD and 11 with RTLA were matched with 54 and 22 patients <b>with</b> <b>AD,</b> respectively. Episodic memory was less impaired in patients with SD than in those <b>with</b> <b>AD</b> (8 versus 2; p< 0. 001) and in patients with RTLA than in those <b>with</b> <b>AD</b> (10 versus 4. 5; p= 0. 009). Semantic memory was more affected in patients with SD than in those <b>with</b> <b>AD,</b> and the Mini Mental State Examination score was higher in patients with RTLA than in those <b>with</b> <b>AD.</b> Comparison of the three diagnostic groups showed that episodic memory was most impaired in AD, whereas SM was most impaired in SD. Conclusion: Since episodic memory impairment is more severe in AD than in SD and RTLA, despite a comparable degree of MTA, atrophy of the medial temporal lobe alone cannot account for episodic memory dysfunction...|$|R

The rs 2837960 _G (minor) allele, which is associated with increased RA risk, was associated <b>with</b> increased <b>AD</b> risk. Analysis of these three SNPs in a Stage 2 population, consisting of ~ 1, 100 AD and ~ 2, 600 non-AD individuals, did not confirm their association <b>with</b> <b>AD.</b> Analysis of Stage 1 and 2 combined suggested that rs 2837960 shows a trend for association <b>with</b> <b>AD.</b> When the Stage 2 population was age-matched for the Stage 1 population, rs 2837960 exhibited a non-significant trend <b>with</b> <b>AD.</b> Combined analysis of Stage 1 and the age-matched Stage 2 subset {{showed a significant association}} of rs 2837960 <b>with</b> <b>AD</b> (p = 0. 002, OR 1. 24) that retained significance following correction for age, sex and APOE (p = 0. 02, OR = 1. 20). Rs 2837960 is near BACE 2, which encodes an aspartic protease capable of processing the AD-associated amyloid precursor protein. Testing fo...|$|R
40|$|The {{estimation}} of the autonomy and the competencies of a person <b>with</b> Alzheimer’s disease (<b>AD)</b> is a complicated process, which may sometimes rely on socially shared stereotypes of this disease and may thus lead to the stigmatization of people <b>with</b> <b>AD.</b> This becomes especially evident {{when it comes to}} rights and responsibilities of persons <b>with</b> <b>AD</b> given that there is no clear-cut definition of these. The aim of the empirical study presented here was to examine perceived rights of people <b>with</b> <b>AD</b> and their relation with indicators of stigmatization. This was analyzed in a sample of laypersons (n= 72) and a sample of health professionals working <b>with</b> persons <b>with</b> <b>AD</b> (n= 113). In particular, the study questionnaire presented a vignette describing in one version a female and in the other version a male person at an early stage of AD followed by a list of 26 rights which had to be rated with respect to the target person on a 5 point Likert-scale. The list showed a factorial structure differing between five domains of perceived rights, namely “right of privacy and information”, right of autonomous living”, “citizen rights”, “right of self-determination and self-responsibility”, and “decision making by significant others”. Moreover, k= 16 emotions towards the target person were analysed as indicators of social distancing. In subsequent steps of analyses, we tested if rights were differently perceived depending on (a) target person’s gender, (b) professional contact <b>with</b> persons <b>with</b> <b>AD</b> and (c) perceived social distancing. Results showed that the rate of agreement to the five identified domains rights was in general quite high across groups; furthermore, participants expressed a low level of social distancing and high pro-social emotional reactions towards persons <b>with</b> <b>AD.</b> Professionals accorded more rights to people <b>with</b> <b>AD</b> than laypersons, showed less social distancing and less pro-social and unpleasant emotions towards the target person. Social distance was higher towards the male target person who elicited more unpleasant emotional reactions and was rated more dangerous than a woman <b>with</b> <b>AD.</b> Findings are discussed with respect to the necessity of creating and developing a culture concerning the rights to be accorded to persons affected <b>with</b> <b>AD...</b>|$|R
