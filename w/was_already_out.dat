The Skopje Aqueduct, located between Scupi and the city centre, is rather mysterious because its date of construction is unknown.

5|$|In France, the {{government}} press misrepresented the battle. Le Moniteur Universel published a report purportedly written by Captain Raymond Cocault of the corvette Diligente. The report began by inaccurately {{claiming that the}} British squadron consisted of nine ships of the line. The report concluded with the information that two British ships had been destroyed on the San Domingo coast alongside three French and that two others had been dismasted and were badly damaged. The official French report, written by Leissègues but not published in France, contradicted this version of events. Leissègues stated that Cocault, with the other smaller warships, had made all sail to the westwards {{at the start of}} the engagement and that by the time the flagship drove ashore, Diligente <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>out</b> of sight. Leissègues remained on Santo Domingo for some time, but had returned to Europe by the time the colony fell to a joint English and Spanish force in July 1809. He later received a regional command in the Ionian Sea and took part in the Adriatic campaign.|$|E

500|$|USS Texas was a second-class {{battleship}} {{built by}} the United States in the early 1890s, the first American battleship commissioned and the first ship {{named in honor of}} the state of Texas to be {{built by the}} United States. Built in reaction to the acquisition of modern armored warships by several South American countries, Texas was meant to incorporate the latest developments in naval tactics and design. This includes the mounting of her main armament en echelon to allow maximum end-on fire and a heavily-armored redoubt amidships to ensure defensive strength. However, due to the state of U.S. industry at the time, Texas's building time was lengthy, and {{by the time she was}} commissioned, she <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>out</b> of date. Nevertheless, she and her near-sister [...] were considered advancements in American naval design.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{said the}} stereo sound helped gamers to locate events that {{occurred}} outside the current viewport. K.

However, Game Revolution and Mac Gamer agreed that visual shortcomings did not reduce Mac gamers' enjoyment of the engrossing gameplay.

500|$|The Gunfight at the OK Corral is {{a famous}} {{example of a}} real-life western shootout, between the Earp Brothers {{together}} with Doc Holliday, and the Clanton-McLaury gang. It lasted only 30 seconds, contrary to many movie adaptations. The gunfight itself did not actually happen in the corral, but in a vacant lot outside of it. The shooting started when Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury cocked their pistols. Both parties simultaneously drew their guns, which added to the confusion of who fired first. It is not known who fired the first shot, but Wyatt's bullet {{was the first to}} hit, tearing through Frank McLaury's belly and sending McLaury’s own shot wild through Wyatt’s coattail. Billy Clanton fired at Virgil, but his shot also went astray when he was hit with Morgan's shot through his ribcage. Billy Claiborne ran as soon as shots were fired and <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>out</b> of sight. Ike Clanton panicked as well and ran towards Wyatt pleading for his life. [...] "Go to fighting or get away!", Wyatt yelled and watched Ike desert his brother Billy and run. Doc instantly killed Tom with blasts from his shotgun. Frank was running to Fremont Street, and he challenged Holliday for killing his brother, but Doc dropped his shotgun, drew his pistol, and shot Frank in the right temple. Wounded and dying, Billy Clanton fired blindly into the gun smoke encircling him, striking Virgil's leg. Wyatt responded by sending several rounds into Billy.|$|E
500|$|At 20:00, Saumarez led his ships {{into the}} Gut after the {{combined}} squadron, {{but in the}} gathering dusk Moreno's squadron <b>was</b> <b>already</b> <b>out</b> of sight and the British admiral realised that his ships were too slow to catch the French and Spanish ships in their current formation before they reached the comparative safety of the open ocean. At 20:40, with the wind picking up, he therefore instructed the squadron to break formation and attack {{the rear of the}} combined squadron, directing his orders at Keats in Superb, whose ship was the fastest. Keats immediately set all sail and by 22:00 had regained sight of the combined squadron's rearguard, which consisted of the 112-gun ships and the Saint Antoine. Behind, all Keats could see was Caesar and Venerable in the distance, and by 23:00 only Caesar was still in sight, more than [...] behind Superb. Although he was now facing considerable odds, Keats steered Superb to within [...] of the Real Carlos at 23:20, coming under fire from all three vessels of the Franco-Spanish rearguard, although evading much of it by the simple tactic of not illuminating his ship so that the ships of the combined squadron fired on one another more than on their British opponent. Linois had also ordered his ships to extinguish their lights, but this only added to the confusion of the Spanish ships in the squadron. The moon had set and the night was quite dark, which contributed to the ineffectiveness of the Spanish gunnery. [...] Real Carlos fired randomly at the British ship but failed to strike it once during the brief engagement. Keats' ship was much more accurate however, firing three broadsides before Superb was carried beyond Real Carlos and towards Saint Antoine. The British broadsides caused severe damage, knocking away the foretopmast and causing a fire to break out on the Spanish ship's deck following the third broadside. The fire grew rapidly and soon was so fierce that it could be plainly seen by observers at Gibraltar.|$|E
