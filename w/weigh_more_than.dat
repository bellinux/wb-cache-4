5|$|Males have {{relatively}} small testes {{compared to other}} lemurs, and their canine teeth are {{the same size as}} those seen in females. During the dry season, females can <b>weigh</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> males. Both patterns of sexual dimorphism are consistent with the theory of sexual selection for monogamous species and female dominance respectively. Females have two pairs of nipples.|$|E
5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} was {{formerly}} often treated as the small, pale northern subspecies {{of the rock}} martin, but it is now usually {{considered to be a}} separate species. The changes in size and colour are continuous, so the evidence for separate species is not strong, although some rock martins can <b>weigh</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> twice as much as the smallest subspecies of the pale crag martin. The average weight for P.o.fusciventris is 22.4g (0.79oz) against 10g (0.35oz) for P.o.obsoleta. There {{do not appear to be}} any intermediate forms where pale crag martins and rock martin populations breed close to each other in Somalia and Ethiopia.|$|E
5|$|Maamaloa Lolohea {{participated in}} the Beijing Olympics on Tonga's behalf, {{competing}} in weightlifting. Lolohea was born in Kolofo'ou, a district of the capital city Nuku'alofa, and competed in Beijing as a 40-year-old in the men's super-heavyweight class division, which encompasses athletes who <b>weigh</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 105kilograms. Lolohea had not previously competed at any Olympic games. The Tongan athlete competed in his event on August 19, where he faced 14 other athletes. During the snatch phase of the event, Lolohea was given three attempts. He successfully lifted 127kilograms on his first attempt, 135kilograms on his second attempt, and 140kilograms on his third and final attempt. During the clean and jerk phase of the event, he successfully lifted 173kilograms on his first try, but unsuccessfully attempted to lift 185kilograms on his second and third attempts. Because his highest scores were 140 in snatch and 173 in clean and jerk, Lolohea's final and total score was 313kilograms. Of the 13 competitors who finished the event, Maamaloa Lolohea finished last behind Sam Pera, Jr. of the Cook Islands (350kilograms), who in turn finished behind Finland's Antti Everi (366kilograms). Gold medalist Matthias Steiner of Germany, in contrast, lifted a total of 461kilograms.|$|E

25|$|Bison are nomadic grazers, {{wandering}} high on Yellowstone's grassy plateaus in summer. Despite their slow gait, bison {{are surprisingly}} fast for animals that <b>weigh</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> half a ton.

In the park interior where snows are deep, they winter in thermally influenced areas and around the geyser basins. Bison also move to winter range {{in the northern part}} of Yellowstone.|$|E
25|$|Fronsac is {{initially}} {{skeptical about the}} beast's existence, since survivors describe it as much larger than any wolf he has ever seen. However, by studying the bite size on {{a victim of the}} beast, he deduces that it must <b>weigh</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 500lb (227kg). Captain Duhamel, an army officer leading the hunt for the beast, has killed dozens of ordinary wolves, but has not come close to the actual killer. While staying in Gévaudan, Fronsac romances Marianne de Morangias, the daughter of a local count, whose brother, Jean-François, was also an avid hunter and a world traveler, before losing one arm to a lion in Africa. Fronsac is also intrigued by Sylvia, an Italian courtesan at the local brothel.|$|E
25|$|At the weigh-ins, Alves {{was over}} his {{division}} weight limit by six pounds, weighing in at 162.6 lbs. Per New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) rules, opposing lightweight fighters must weigh within 7 pounds of one another. Having not yet completed his own official weigh-in, Alves' opponent Jim Miller (who {{was within the}} designated lightweight limit) was able to rehydrate and officially weigh in over the limit himself, at 157.6 lbs, allowing the bout to proceed as catchweight. NYSAC and UFC officials indicated that Alves must not <b>weigh</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 173 lbs {{the day of the}} fight, or it would be cancelled. As a result of missing the original designated weight, Alves was fined 20% of his purse, which went to his opponent.|$|E

25|$|In most applications, {{multiple}} cans {{are arranged}} around the central {{axis of the}} engine, and their shared exhaust is fed to the turbine(s). Can type combustors were most widely used in early gas turbine engines, owing to their ease of design and testing (one can test a single can, rather than have to test the whole system). Can type combustors are easy to maintain, as only a single can needs to be removed, rather than the whole combustion section. Most modern gas turbine engines (particularly for aircraft applications) do not use can combustors, as they often <b>weigh</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> alternatives. Additionally, the pressure drop across the can is generally higher than other combustors (on the order of 7%). Most modern engines that use can combustors are turboshafts featuring centrifugal compressors.|$|E
25|$|In rugby union, World Rugby {{regulates the}} size and shape of the ball under Law 2 (also known as Law E.R.B); an {{official}} rugby union ball is oval and made of four panels, has a length in-line of 280–300 millimetres, a circumference (end to end) of 740–770 millimetres, and a circumference (in width) of 580–620 millimetres. It is made of leather or suitable synthetic material, and may be treated to make it water resistant and easier to grip. The rugby ball may not <b>weigh</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 460grams or less than 410 and has an air pressure of 65.71–68.75 kilopascals, or 0.67–0.70 kilograms per square centimetre, or 9.5–10.0lbs per square inch. Spare balls are allowed under the condition that players or teams do not seek an advantage by changing the ball. Smaller sized balls may also be used in games between younger players.|$|E

Production concluded in August 2014, with new vehicle production totalling 1,591. While it was believed the U.S. Army {{would have liked to}} continue HET A1 production through fiscal year 2017, no awards were made and in July 2016 the US Army announced that it wished to use FY16 funds to start an engineering study into an E-HET that would replace the current M1070A1 and M1000 semi-trailer. This study had previously been slated to commence in FY17.

25|$|WZT-2 (Wóz Zabezpieczenia Technicznego - Armoured {{recovery}} vehicle) - Polish ARV {{built on}} T-55 hull. It {{was built to}} perform repairs on T-55 and T-55A tanks. When it entered service in 1973 {{it was not only}} the best ARV in the whole Warsaw Pact but probably in the whole world. It is still able to carry out tasks that NATO gives ARVs of its class. Unlike the T-55 and the WZT-1, the WZT-2 is still the basic ARV of the Polish army used for field repairs. It's able to perform repairs not only on Soviet tanks like the T-54/T-55 and T-72 but also on Polish PT-91 and German Leopard 2A4. However, because all tanks currently in Polish service <b>weigh</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 40 tons it is unable to tow them. It is used to tow lighter vehicles like BWP-1 and 2S1.

Many have private owners who bought them from the Polish Army. 196 of these vehicles were also sold to India. The vehicles were also bought by Iraq and Yugoslavia.|$|E
