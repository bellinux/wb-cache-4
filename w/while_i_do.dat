2500|$|Science {{journalist}} Nigel Hawkes, {{writing in}} The Times, said that Sheldrake was [...] "trying {{to bridge the}} gap between phenomenalism and science", and suggested that dogs could appear to have psychic abilities when they were actually relying on more conventional senses. He concluded by saying, [...] "whether scientists will be willing to take [...] seriously is ... that need not concern most readers. <b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think this book will change the world, it will cause plenty of harmless fun." ...|$|E
2500|$|But, {{towards the}} Buddha, {{who came from}} the Sakyan people, King Pasenadi reveres, praises, and serves the Buddha with utmost respect. Even the monarch thinks like this: [...] "The Shramana Gotama had perfect birth, while I am not perfect. The Shramana Gotama is mighty, while I am weak. The Shramana Gotama {{inspired}} awe and respect, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not. The Shramana Gotama is vastly influential and charming, while I only possess small influence." [...] As even the King respects Dhamma, reveres Dhamma, and obeys Dhamma, therefore he bows and praises the Tathagatha.|$|E

60|$|So I {{refilled}} {{the shallow}} hand-lamps, and <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> so Orme took some hasty observations {{of which he}} jotted down the results in his pocket-book.|$|R

6000|$|Nasmyth {{laid down}} his cigar {{and looked at}} him. [...] "Isn't it a little exorbitant? You get the land at cost value, and a heavy charge on that, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> the work?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, boys," [...] said he, [...] "you must {{be still}} as {{moonlight}} <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> it. If {{you speak to}} me, you will put me out; and besides, you will frighten little Bunny." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'In a {{short time}} the two men {{described}} by the dervish entered the room, and at a sign from him my sister made room at her side for one, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{the same for the}} other.|$|R
6000|$|... 'There--enough of that. I {{wish to see}} you {{on another}} subject. You invited me to read that paper, the night before last, and listened attentively <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> so.' 'I did,' replied Mr. Pickwick; 'and I {{certainly}} thought--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Footnote 16: I {{observed}} {{this point}} in Myth, Ritual, and Religion, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not see the implication, {{that the idea of}} 'spirit' was not necessarily present in the savage conception of the primal Beings, Creators, or Makers.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, lads," [...] said Maggot, with {{a slap on}} the leathern apron {{that covered}} his knees, [...] "this is the way on it, an' do 'ee be quiet and hould yer tongues <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> spaik." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must make}} fast the end first, or we may lose the whole," [...] {{he said to}} Eustacia, who had drawn near. [...] "Could you hold this a moment, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> it--or shall I call your servant?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, {{since our}} roads run {{together}} for a <b>while,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not see that we in any way depart from our Search if so be we accompany her--at least as far as--I have forgotten {{the name of the}} city.' ...|$|E
60|$|For a <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not seem}} to believe it; this {{obviously}} imminent event stunned me when it came, as though I had never had an anticipatory moment. For a <b>while</b> <b>I</b> went on working, and then almost apathetically, in a mood of half-reluctant curiosity, I started for Lowchester.|$|R
5000|$|The great {{difference}} between your correspondent ‘STAYLACE' and myself seems to be, {{that she was}} encased in corsets at an early age, and thus became gradually accustomed to tight-lacing, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not wear them till I went to school, at fourteen, and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not wear them voluntarily.|$|R
6000|$|Yet his King made answer (few such Kings there be!) 'Here is Bread {{and here}} is Wine--sit and sup with me. Eat and drink in Mary's Name, the <b>whiles</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> recall How Iron--Cold Iron--can be master of men all!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The magazine's {{over the}} bridge," [...] said Bevan. [...] "I dug it there for safety. Come, Tom, the keg's {{too heavy for}} the boy. I must fetch it myself, and you must guard the bridge <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't {{believe a}} boy who would try to help a child {{when he was in}} want himself could do {{anything}} very wicked, Joseph. Sit right here <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> the dishes, for that will {{give me a chance to}} think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, I {{am going}} to be my own maid for a <b>while.</b> <b>I</b> expect <b>I</b> <b>do</b> appear a very {{helpless}} individual, but really <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not feel so. Perhaps I have had just a little too much waiting on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ye see, I'm {{going to}} get up a prime gang to take down with ye, Tom; it'll make it sociable and {{pleasant}} like,--good company will, ye know.

60|$|We twisted {{ourselves}} about, and lay {{as still}} as death, with every sense alert. In a little <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not doubt that something was quietly ascending the cleft.

6000|$|... "The brute {{is seldom}} wrong," [...] I said, [...] "and <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not doubt your {{superior}} knowledge, Thern, I think that I shall {{do well to}} listen to the voice of instinct that is backed by love and loyalty." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I hear something," [...] Wulf said. [...] "It {{comes from}} the front. Run round {{to the right and}} bring the sentries from that flank and post them in the {{intervals}} of those in front, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> the same on the left." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't like {{to think}} of that even now. I felt like a murderer <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it, though my anger was hot against him. When I stood over him and saw him {{bleeding}} on the white sand, and his beautiful great legs and neck writhing in his last agony ... Pah! ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{slowly and}} with the {{greatest}} dignity I gradually arose, stretched my arms, yawned like one awaking from heavy sleep, turned and looked upon them unconcernedly. <b>While</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> so, <b>I</b> noticed that old Indaba-zimbi was almost fainting from exhaustion. Beads of perspiration stood upon his brow, his limbs trembled, and his breast heaved.|$|R
6000|$|... "Alas! Tolly, I {{have not}} even scissors; besides, if I had, {{it would take me}} at least two minutes with all the {{strength}} of my fingers to cut the thongs that bind you with scissors, and I don't think the Redskins would stand quietly by and look on <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it.

6000|$|... "Why can't he ever {{remember}} to pull down the shades? Cy Bogart {{and all the}} beastly boys peeping in. But the poor dear, he's absent-minded about minute--minush--whatever the word is. He has so much worry and work, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> nothing but jabber to Bea.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't {{try your}} sum yet, then,' she said. 'Practise your scales {{for half an}} hour, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> my algebra, and then we'll go over your German verbs together. I'll tell Miss Vincent, and she wont' mind, and I think mamma will be pleased if you try.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How shy {{you are of}} {{speaking}} the new name! 'She' will like it, I assure you, for she makes my friends hers. Sylvia, come here, and tell Adam he is welcome; he dares to doubt it. Come and talk over old times, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> the same with Faith." ...|$|E
3000|$|... … I {{have seen}} that the {{students}} are reluctant and {{do not participate in}} this writing class. <b>I</b> think <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> my best to consider all the required factors involving in self-assessment and peer-assessment in my writing class the issue was something else. The students did not see any progress in their writing performance and this impeded them from doing the activities willingly.|$|R
6000|$|... "One by one I slowly {{opened the}} folds of the letter; feeling, <b>while</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> so, the strangest incapability of fixing my {{attention}} on the very lines that I was burning to read. But why dwell any longer on sensations which I can't describe? It will be more to the purpose if I place the letter itself, for future reference, on this page of my journal.|$|R
5000|$|Aishwarya holds a B.E. {{degree in}} Biotechnology from P.E.S. Institute of Technology, Bangalore. She {{worked as an}} {{executive}} in biotechnology industry.
