25|$|Intermediate {{pressure}} creep: This {{is a slow}} leak of {{the first}} stage valve. The effect is for the interstage pressure to rise until either the next breath is drawn, or the pressure exerts more force on the second stage valve than can be resisted by the spring, and the valve opens briefly, often with a popping sound, to relieve the pressure. {{the frequency of the}} popping pressure relief depends on the flow in the second stage, the back pressure, the second stage spring tension and the magnitude of the leak. It may range from occasional loud pops to a constant hiss. Underwater the second stage may be damped by the water and the loud pops may become an intermittent or constant stream of bubbles. This is not usually a catastrophic failure mode, but should be fixed as it <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>worse,</b> and it wastes gas.|$|E

2500|$|A 2005 study {{measuring}} corruption by Berlin-based Transparency International {{found that}} 50 percent of Mexicans remain pessimistic about corruption {{and believe it}} <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>worse.</b> [...] The survey showed that Mexico {{was one of the}} top four countries where the largest number of respondents answered yes when asked if they or someone in their family had paid any kind of bribe in the last 12 months. [...] In Mexico the ruling elite often operate outside of the law leading to the police becoming an instrument by which the rule of force is implemented. [...] Without respect {{for the rule of law}} economic activity becomes arbitrary and unpredictable, and something as simple as a business contract can quickly become unenforceable.|$|E

2500|$|Up to 25% of {{patients}} with TB of the lymph nodes (TB lymphadenitis) <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>worse</b> on treatment before they get better and this usually happens {{in the first few}} months of treatment. A few weeks after starting treatment, lymph nodes often start to enlarge, and previously solid lymph nodes may soften and develop into tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis. [...] This should not be interpreted as failure of therapy and is a common reason for patients (and their physicians) to panic unnecessarily. [...] With patience, two to three months into treatment the lymph nodes start to shrink again and re-aspiration or re-biopsy of the lymph nodes is unnecessary: if repeat microbiological studies are ordered, they will show the continued presence of viable bacteria with the same sensitivity pattern, which further adds to the confusion: physicians inexperienced in the treatment of TB will then often add second-line drugs in the belief that the treatment is not working. [...] In these situations, all that is required is re-assurance. [...] Steroids may be useful in resolving the swelling, especially if it is painful, but they are unnecessary. [...] Additional antibiotics are unnecessary and the treatment regimen does not need to be lengthened.|$|E
2500|$|When the 19-year {{intercalary}} cycle was finalised in the 4th century, {{the earliest}} Passover (in year 16 of the cycle) {{coincided with the}} northward equinox, which means that Passover fell near the first full moon after the northward equinox, or that the northward equinox landed within one lunation before 16 days after the molad of Nisan. This is still the case in about 80% of years; but, in about 20% of years, Passover is a month late by these criteria (as it was in AM 5765 and 5768, the 8th and 11th years of the 19-year cycle = Gregorian 2005 and 2008 CE). Presently, this occurs after the [...] "premature" [...] insertion of a leap month in years 8, 11, and 19 of each 19-year cycle, which causes the northward equinox to land on exceptionally early Hebrew dates in such years. This problem <b>will</b> <b>get</b> <b>worse</b> over time, and so beginning in AM 5817 (2057 CE), year 3 of each 19-year cycle {{will also be a}} month late. If the calendar is not amended, then Passover will start to land on or after the summer solstice around AM 16652 (12892 CE). (The exact year when this will begin to occur depends on uncertainties in the future tidal slowing of the Earth rotation rate, and on the accuracy of predictions of precession and Earth axial tilt.) ...|$|E

Talks between ZANU-PF and the MDC restarted in South Africa on 25 November, again mediated by Mbeki. Mbeki described the negotiations as [...] "the same as ever, forward and backwards, sideways and around ... the usual". Tsvangirai released a statement on 26 November calling on Mbeki to step down. According to Tsvangirai, Mbeki [...] "does not appear to understand how desperate the problem in Zimbabwe is, and the solutions he proposes are too small"; he also accused Mbeki of supporting ZANU-PF and said that the MDC could not [...] "continue negotiating under his facilitation". Two days later, a letter from Mbeki sharply criticising Tsvangirai's position was published. In this letter, Mbeki urged Tsvangirai to [...] "take responsibility for the future of Zimbabwe" [...] instead of devoting himself to [...] "being a militant critic of President Mugabe and ZANU-PF." [...] In response to Tsvangirai's accusation that the SADC leaders lacked the courage to confront Mugabe, Mbeki said that Tsvangirai had [...] "describe us {{in a manner that is}} most offensive in terms of African culture". He also suggested that Tsvangirai perhaps believed [...] "that others further away, in Western Europe and North America, are of greater importance" [...] to Zimbabwe than other countries in the region and Africa as a whole.|$|E
