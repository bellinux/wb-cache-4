5|$|Radioactive {{rubidium}} beams can {{be produced}} since 2015 at CERN's HIE-ISOLDE apparatus with sufficient intensity to consider the production of element 120 in the reaction of rubidium beams with a bismuth-209 target in a cold fusion reaction. In particular, the use of 95Rb <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> neutron shell at N = 184 to be reached.|$|E
5|$|A second Anglo-Franco-Hellenic {{force would}} then attack the 1st Bulgarian Army between Kožuf and Lake Doiran, {{preventing}} it from forming new defensive {{positions in the}} area. The initial advance <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> Armée d'Orient to progress in support of other units first to Prilep, Disma and Borran. In the meantime, an Anglo-Hellenic force would strike Mount Belasica, occupying the Rupel Pass.|$|E

5|$|Although McCartney {{had hoped}} {{technology}} <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> virtual band members {{to appear in}} hyper-realistic detail, Harmonix opted to start with more exaggerated, cartoon-like designs, gradually scaling them back to appear more realistic. Animation for the Beatles characters was aided by motion capture provided by Beatles tribute bands. Dhani Harrison also assisted with modeling for character animation in the game.|$|E
5|$|As of October2014, Caltrans had {{considered}} relinquishing {{the eastern part}} of SR54 from the SR94 junction up to the El Cajon city limits to the County of San Diego. Two years later, the CTC approved a Caltrans proposal to revoke the proposed freeway status of the unconstructed portion of SR54 since the existing roads including Jamacha Boulevard would be able to handle the projected traffic load; this <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> unused land to be sold.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Cold War, the US Army {{considered}} new {{options for}} the integration and organization of active duty, Army Reserve and Army National Guard units in training and deployment. Two division headquarters activated in the active duty component for training National Guard units. The 7th Infantry Division and the 24th Infantry Division headquarters were selected. The subordinate brigades of the divisions did not activate so they could not be deployed as divisions, however their active duty status <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> headquarters to focus on the national guard units under them full-time.|$|E

5|$|On 15 August 2008, 1FLTV, {{licensed}} by Liechtenstein's Government, {{became the first}} broadcaster based in Liechtenstein. This <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> country to begin competing at the Eurovision Song Contest for the first time, should they decide to join the EBU, a pre-requisite for entering the contest. Shortly after its foundation however, the broadcaster announced {{that they were not}} interested in joining the EBU or Eurovision at that time because they had no budget for membership.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary {{engineering}} {{and a final}} tunnel design was completed by {{a joint venture between}} AECOM and Arup. The first phase was originally supposed to include a core tunneling section between 62nd and 92nd Streets, as well as a spur from Third Avenue/63rd Street to Second Avenue/65th Street. The 96th Street station cavern, as well as existing tunnels, <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> first phase's trackage to run from 62nd to 105th Streets. Before construction started, the MTA revised their plans so that the construction of the section between 62nd and 65th Streets was postponed.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1989 {{there were}} four local trains in each {{direction}} from Oslo to Hønefoss; followed by on rush hour service each, but this single service has since been terminated; mainly due to quicker travel times by coaches. The Ringerike Line <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> Oslo Commuter Rail once again to serve Ringerike; other places served usually have one hourly service, with additional services in rush hour. Reducing travel time from Hønefoss to Oslo to 30 minutes would probably cause larger population growth in Ringerike.|$|E

Qatar Radio has stated that they hope to join Eurovision by 2011.|$|E
5|$|The Apennine mountains, which rise to {{a height}} of nearly farther above the mare plain than the Himalayan front above the Indian and Nepalese plainsare {{hypothesized}} to be fault-block mountains displaced upward and segmented by the impact that formed Mare Imbrium. The frontal escarpment of Mons Hadley Delta {{is believed to be}} an exposed segment of the pre-Imbrium impact lunar crust. This made the mountain one of the mission's primary objectives, as it <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> astronauts to obtain samples of the lunar crust as it was before the creation of Mare Imbrium.|$|E

5|$|A {{project group}} {{with members of}} the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and the National Rail Administration have {{proposed}} that instead of rebuilding the Ulriken Tunnel to double track, a new double-track light rail tunnel could be built from the city center to Arna. This <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> light rail line to replace the two-station Bergen Commuter Rail service, and give better access to the city center for people from Arna. Several politicians, including the majority in Hordaland County Council, have stated {{that in the long run}} they want the light rail line extended northwards to Knarvik and westwards to Straume and Kleppestø.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the battle for the Donets, as the spring rasputitsa (mud) season came to an end in 1943, both the German and Soviet commands considered their plans for future operations. The Soviet premier Joseph Stalin and some senior Soviet officers wanted to seize the initiative first and attack the German forces inside the Soviet Union, but they were convinced by a number of key commanders, including the Deputy Supreme Commander Georgiy Zhukov, to assume a defensive posture instead. This <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> German side to weaken themselves in attacking prepared positions, after which the Soviet forces would be able to respond with a counter-offensive.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} in February 1913, poet and lawyer Luis Lloréns Torres had {{publicly}} requested that Betances' wishes {{to have his}} ashes returned to Puerto Rico be fulfilled. The Nationalist Association (predecessor of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party), under the presidency of José Coll y Cuchí, was able to convince the Puerto Rican Legislative Assembly to approve an act that <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> transfer of the mortal remains of Puerto Rican patriot Ramón Emeterio Betances from Paris, France to Puerto Rico. Seven years after the act's approval, the Legislative Assembly commissioned one of its delegates, Alfonso Lastra Charriez, {{to serve as an}} emissary and bring Betances' remains from France.|$|E

5|$|As of 2011, {{the port}} {{ranks as the}} largest {{passenger}} port in Croatia and the third largest passenger port in the Mediterranean, with annual passenger volume of approximately 4million. By 2010, the Port of Split recorded 18,000 ship arrivals each year. The port is managed by the Port of Split Authority (PSA). In the late 2000s, the PSA and the port operators, Trajektna Luka Split d.d. and Luka d.d. Split, started to implement an investment plan aimed at increasing both passenger and cargo traffic volume, scheduled {{to be completed by}} 2015, which <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> port to handle up to 7million passengers per year.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, the United States National Helium Reserve {{accounted}} for 30 {{percent of the}} world's helium. The reserve was expected {{to run out of}} helium in 2018.

Other large reserves were in the Hugoton in Kansas, United States, and nearby gas fields of Kansas and the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma. New helium plants were scheduled to open in 2012 in Qatar, Russia, and the US state of Wyoming, but they were not expected to ease the shortage.|$|E
5|$|Braathens SAFE {{applied for}} a {{concession}} on a route from Norway to New York on 27 March 1950. This <b>would</b> <b>allow</b> <b>the</b> airline to connect the route to the Hong Kong-flights, giving one continual service. The proposal would involve the purchase of Douglas DC-6B or Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation aircraft. The proposal {{was rejected by the}} government on 19 April. The following year, Braathens SAFE applied to extend the route to Tokyo, but this was also rejected by the government. In 1951, the company applied to purchase two Super Constellations to replace two sold DC-4s, which was granted, and on 14 January 1953 for an extension of the concession for another ten years. On 13 November 1953, the government rejected the concession application, stating that Norway was bound to grant the concession to SAS {{on the basis of the}} merger agreement.|$|E
