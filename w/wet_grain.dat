50|$|In {{batch drying}} methods, {{certain amount of}} grain is placed first, usually 2 to 4 inches, the batch is dried and cooled later, then drying is stopped and batch is removed.

When adding stirring system, unequilibrium moisture content problem is avoided, however, stirrer is an added expense. When using bin-batch roof dryer, time losing problem can be solved. There is a drying floor under the bin roof and the drying fan and burner is installed high on the bin wall.

Significant amounts of grain remained unharvested. A significant percentage was lost during processing and transportation, or spoiled at elevators (<b>wet</b> <b>grain).</b> The total Winter sowing area shrunk by approximately 2 million hectares. Livestock in kolkhozes remained without forage, which was collected under grain procurement. A similar occurrence happened with respect to seeds and wages awarded in kind for kolhoz members.

Many kolkhozes from December 1931 onwards suffered from lack of food, resulting in an increased number of deaths caused by malnutrition registered by OGPU in some areas (Moldavia as a whole and several central rayons of Vinnytsia, Kiev and North-East rayons of Odessa oblasts) in winter-spring and the early summer months of 1932.
