40|$|We {{assessed}} the mortality rates by age, sex, race, blood type, primary diagnosis, treatment and transplantation history of 8432 patients in Canada for whom {{end-stage renal disease}} (ESRD) was diagnosed between 1981 and 1986. Significant differences in the probability of dying were found between those with and without diabetes mellitus, between those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> a renal transplant and those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not, between white and nonwhite patients and between various age groups. The mortality rates of the ESRD patients were {{at least three times}} higher than those of the general Canadian population. Primary diagnosis and treatment were significantly associated with the risk of dying among the ESRD patients. For those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> a transplant, the length of time spent waiting for a transplant was positively associated with the risk of death from ESRD. Patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> peritoneal dialysis before transplantation had a higher risk of death than those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> either hemodialysis (risk ratio 1. 3) or transplantation (risk ratio 3. 2) as the first treatment. No significant differences were found in the cause of death between those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> peritoneal dialysis and those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> hemodialysis. Almost half of the deaths among women without diabetes <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> a transplant were due to infection...|$|R

5|$|In adults, {{widespread}} {{screening of}} the general population is a matter of debate. Some organizations (such as the United States Preventive Services Task Force) state that evidence is insufficient to support routine screening, while others (such as the American Thyroid Association) recommend either intermittent testing above a certain age in both sexes or only in women. Targeted screening may be appropriate in a number of situations where hypothyroidism is common: other autoimmune diseases, a strong family history of thyroid disease, those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>received</b> radioiodine or other radiation therapy to the neck, those who have previously undergone thyroid surgery, those with an abnormal thyroid examination, those with psychiatric disorders, people taking amiodarone or lithium, and those with a number of health conditions (such as certain heart and skin conditions). Yearly thyroid function tests are recommended in people with Down syndrome, as they are at higher risk of thyroid disease.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church follows {{an episcopal}} polity, led by bishops <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>received</b> {{the sacrament of}} Holy Orders who are given formal jurisdictions of {{governance}} within the church. There are three levels of clergy, the episcopate, composed of bishops who hold jurisdiction over a geographic area called a diocese or eparchy; the presbyterate, composed of priests ordained by bishops and who work in local diocese or religious orders; and the diaconate, composed of deacons who assist bishops and priests {{in a variety of}} ministerial roles. Ultimately leading the entire Catholic Church is the Bishop of Rome, commonly called the pope, whose jurisdiction is called the Holy See. In parallel to the diocesan structure are a variety of religious institutes that function autonomously, often subject only to the authority of the pope, though sometimes subject to the local bishop. Most religious institutes only have male or female members but some have both. Additionally, lay members aid many liturgical functions during worship services.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{variation}} in the rate and extent of recovery. The prognosis of Guillain–Barré syndrome is determined mainly by age (those over 40 may have a poorer outcome), and by the severity of symptoms after two weeks. Furthermore, those who experienced diarrhea before the onset of disease have a worse prognosis. On the nerve conduction study, the presence of conduction block predicts poorer outcome at 6 months. In those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>received</b> intravenous immunoglobulins, a smaller increase in IgG in the blood two weeks after administration is associated with poorer mobility outcomes at six months than those whose IgG level increased substantially. If the disease continues to progress beyond four weeks, or there are multiple fluctuations in the severity (more than two in eight weeks), the diagnosis may be chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, which is treated differently.|$|E
40|$|Of 572 {{patients}} with prostatic carcinoma, 497 received endocrine therapy as the initial treatment. These patients were surveyed in a cooperative research study by members from five universities. Prognosis, {{causes of death}} and side effects of estrogen therapy were studied. The prognosis of patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> endocrine therapy became worse, as the stage progressed. The prognosis of those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> a combination of estrogen therapy with castration tended {{to be better than}} that of those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> estrogen therapy alone. Similarly, the prognosis of those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> a combination of progesterone therapy with castration tended to be better than that of those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> had progesterone therapy alone. No relationship was found between estrogen doses (low, medium and high) and prognosis, although a precise comparison among the three could not be made because of the smaller number of patents with low doses. A high dose of estrogen may not always be the indication, rather a medium dose such as 300 mg diethylstilbestrol diphosphate may be clinically appropriate. The cause of death could be identified in 303 patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> endocrine therapy. Cancer-related death was the most frequent (63. 7 %), and cardio- or cerebrovascular death accounted for only 14. 2 % of the cases. When this analysis was confined to the patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> estrogen therapy, estrogen administration seemed to be the cause of cardio- or cerebrovascular death of 16. 1 % of the patients. Daily dosing of estrogen was not definitely related to the incidence, or the interval to cardio- or cerebrovascular death. However, among the patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> died of cardio- or cerebrovascular disease, 50 % of the patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> a medium or high dose of estrogen tended to die within two years after treatment, while 50 % of those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> a low dose died within three years...|$|R

5|$|Personal traits such as age, gender, location, and {{education}} correlate, either positively or negatively, with HIV/AIDS awareness levels. For example, older women have demonstrated {{higher levels of}} knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS than younger women in Malawi. Because men typically have greater access to education and other social resources, they are often more knowledgeable about HIV prevention and transmission than women. While men are, on average, able to list 2.2 ways to prevent HIV transmission, women are only able to list 1.5 ways. Only 38% of women surveyed in 2003-2004 understood that their husbands {{would be less likely}} to contract HIV if they used condoms during intercourse with prostitutes and other women from high-risk groups. In addition, men who are raised in urban environments are, on average, more informed about HIV/AIDS than men who are raised in rural environments, presumably because urban children typically have greater access to educational resources than rural children. Among both men and women, higher levels of education correspond to increased knowledge about HIV/AIDS: men and women <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>received</b> secondary school educations are significantly more likely to understand complex aspects of the disease, such as the fact that people who appear healthy can still be HIV-positive, than those who have not. Finally, people who have lost friends or family members to the disease are likely to have greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS due to their personal, firsthand exposure to the problem.|$|E

30|$|The ORR and CBR (54.3 and 62.9  %, respectively) in {{this phase}} II trial were higher than those in a global phase II trial {{conducted}} by McIntyre et al. (28.6 and 51.8  %, respectively) (McIntyre et al. 2014), which {{might be due to}} differences in the proportion of patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> neo/adjuvant chemotherapy. In our trial, the ORR was higher in patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not <b>received</b> any neo/adjuvant chemotherapy than in those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> (70.0 vs. 33.3  %). Among patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> neo/adjuvant chemotherapy, patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not <b>received</b> anthracycline- or taxane-based regimens had higher ORR than those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> anthracycline- or taxane-based neo/adjuvant chemotherapy (64.0 vs. 30.0  %). Our trial included a smaller proportion of patients <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> neo/adjuvant chemotherapy (43  %) than McIntyre’s trial (68  %). In addition, only 29  % of the patients included in our trial <b>had</b> <b>received</b> anthracycline- or taxane-based neo/adjuvant chemotherapy, while in McIntyre’s trial, 48 and 46  % of patients <b>had</b> <b>received</b> anthracycline- or taxane-based neo/adjuvant chemotherapy, respectively. Consequently, the lower proportion of patients in our trial <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>received</b> neo/adjuvant chemotherapy, especially anthracycline- or taxane-based neo/adjuvant chemotherapy, might have led to the higher ORR. Moreover, the ORRs were comparable to those with nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (42  %) and higher than those with paclitaxel (27  %) as first-line chemotherapy for MBC as shown in a phase III trial conducted outside Japan (Gradishar et al. 2005). The median time to response and duration of response (1.4 and 4.6  months, respectively) among patients who reached ORR in our trial were similar to those in McIntyre’s trial (1.4 and 5.8  months, respectively) (McIntyre et al. 2014).|$|R
