5|$|Specific {{plans or}} {{strategic}} themes will often arise from particular groups of openings which {{result in a}} specific type of pawn structure. An example is the , which is the attack of queenside pawns against an opponent <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> pawns on the queenside. The study of openings is therefore connected to the preparation of plans that are typical of the resulting middlegames.|$|E

25|$|Gardner {{argues that}} there is a wide range of {{cognitive}} abilities, but that there are only very weak correlations among them. For example, the theory postulates that a child who learns to multiply easily is not necessarily more intelligent than a child <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> difficulty on this task. The child who takes more time to master multiplication may best learn to multiply through a different approach, may excel in a field outside mathematics, or may be looking at and understanding the multiplication process at a fundamentally deeper level.|$|E

2500|$|When Kolmogorov {{became aware}} of Solomonoff's work, he {{acknowledged}} Solomonoff's priority. For several years, Solomonoff's work was better known in the Soviet Union than in the Western World. The general consensus in the scientific community, however, was to associate this type of complexity with Kolmogorov, who was concerned with randomness of a sequence, while Algorithmic Probability became associated with Solomonoff, who focused on prediction using his invention of the universal prior probability distribution. The broader area encompassing descriptional complexity and probability is often called Kolmogorov complexity.

2500|$|According to the mythographic {{compendium}} Bibliotheke, {{different stories}} were {{told of the}} cause of his blindness, the most direct being that he was simply blinded by the gods for revealing their secrets. An alternative story told by the poet Pherecydes was followed in Callimachus' poem [...] "The Bathing of Pallas"; in it, Tiresias was blinded by Athena after he stumbled onto her bathing naked. His mother, Chariclo, a nymph of Athena, begged Athena to undo her curse, but the goddess could not; instead, she cleaned his ears, giving him the ability to understand birdsong, thus the gift of augury. In a separate episode, Tiresias was drawn into an argument between Hera and her husband Zeus, on the theme of <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>more</b> pleasure in sex: the man, as Hera claimed; or, as Zeus claimed, the woman, as Tiresias had experienced both. Tiresias replied, [...] "Of ten parts a man enjoys one only." [...] Hera instantly struck him blind for his impiety. Zeus could do nothing to stop her or reverse her curse, but in recompense he did give Tiresias the gift of foresight and a lifespan of seven lives.|$|E
