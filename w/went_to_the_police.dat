5|$|Alerted by a witness, MalcolmX and a {{small group}} of Muslims <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> station and demanded to see Johnson. Police {{initially}} denied that any Muslims were being held, but when the crowd grew to about five hundred, they allowed MalcolmX to speak with Johnson. Afterward, MalcolmX insisted on arranging for an ambulance to take Johnson to Harlem Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Her {{position}} {{changed the}} following month. She {{had had a}} series of rows with Bamber. He seemed to want to end the relationship, and they had argued about his involvement in the murders. She told him he was a psychopath and at one point tried to smother him with a pillow. During one argument on 4 September, another woman telephoned Bamber in her presence, and it became clear to Mugford that he had been seeing that woman too. Mugford smashed a mirror, slapped Bamber and he twisted her arm up her back. Three days later she <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> and changed her statement.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the police}} were sure murder had taken place, and {{that at least one}} of the four was guilty, they were {{uncertain}} whether they could secure a conviction. Police also suspected there had been other murders committed, but the lack of bodies hampered this line of enquiry. As news of the possibility of other murders came to the public's attention, newspapers began to publish lurid and inaccurate stories of the crimes; speculative reports led members of the public to assume that all missing people had been victims. Janet Brown <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> and identified her friend Mary Paterson's clothing, while a local baker informed them that Jamie Wilson's trousers were being worn by Constantine Burke's son. On 19 November a warrant for the murder of Jamie Wilson was made against the four suspects.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s British {{intelligence}} {{learned that the}} ANO held accounts with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) in London. BCCI was closed in July 1991 by banking regulators in six countries after evidence emerged of widespread fraud. Abu Nidal himself {{was said to have}} visited London using the name Shakar Farhan; a BCCI branch manager, who passed information about the ANO accounts to MI5, reportedly drove him around several stores in London without realizing who he was. Abu Nidal was using a company called SAS International Trading and Investments in Warsaw as cover for arms deals. The company's transactions included the purchase of riot guns, ostensibly for Syria, then when the British refused an export licence to Syria, for an African state; in fact half the shipment <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> in East Germany and half to Abu Nidal.|$|E
25|$|George Subgrunski <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> {{shortly after}} the murder and {{reported}} seeing a man walking to the Degnan home carrying a bag at 1:00am. He described the man as around 5ft9in tall, 170lbs and 35 {{years of age and}} wearing a light-colored fedora and dark coat. His evidence was found to be inconsistent and was dismissed by several investigators.|$|E
25|$|After her father's death, Rita became {{closer to}} her brother and to his wife, Piera Aiello. Since her brother was also a Mafioso, Rita was privy to {{detailed}} information on the doings of the Mafia in Partanna. She also dated a boy who moved in the criminal underworld. In June 1991, the Mafia killed Nicolò Atria. A month later her brother’s widow <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> and talked – deciding to collaborate with the judicial authorities.|$|E

50|$|San Francisco {{issued a}} public safety alert which, along with media publicity, led a mark <b>to</b> {{recognize}} <b>the</b> scam and <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>police.</b> <b>The</b> prosecution was controversial because the scammers claimed {{they were being}} forced by organized crime bosses <b>to</b> operate <b>the</b> scam, or their relatives would be harmed.|$|R

25|$|Schmid and {{his friends}} took Rowe to the desert, where Schmid and Saunders murdered her. Before murdering Alleen, Schmid told Saunders to rape her, but he couldn't do it, because Saunders was gay. While the murder occurred, Mary French {{was waiting in the}} car and {{listening}} to the radio. Afterwards the three buried her. When Alleen went missing, her father told her mother he felt she had been murdered and left in the desert. The mother, Norma Rowe, <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> and was told that she needed more evidence before they could go looking in the desert.|$|E
25|$|Kallinger {{was arrested}} and imprisoned in 1972 when his {{children}} <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>police.</b> While in jail, he had scored 82 on an IQ test and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, and state psychiatrists recommended that he be supervised with his family. The children later recanted their allegations, however. Two years later, one of his children, Joseph, Jr., {{was found dead in}} the rubble of an old building, two weeks after Kallinger took out a large life insurance policy on his sons. Though Kallinger claimed that Joseph, Jr. had run away from home, the insurance company, suspecting foul play, refused to pay out the claim.|$|E
25|$|Burton {{was born}} in Indianapolis, the son of Bonnie L. (née Hardesty) and Charles W. Burton. His father, a former policeman, was abusive to his mother, and never held a job for very long. The family moved constantly, living in trailer parks, cabins, and motels. In June 1950, some years after the couple divorced, his mother <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> and got a {{restraining}} order against his father. He responded by kidnapping Burton's mother. Burton and his younger brother and sister were briefly sent to the Marion County Children's Guardian Home. After his mother escaped, Burton's father went to jail for two years. Burton's mother remarried, and Burton and his younger brother and sister had happier teenage years.|$|E

25|$|The murder {{investigation}} began in 1988 after Wood's ex-husband, {{whom she had}} told about the murders, <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>police.</b> Detectives for the Walker Police Department extensively questioned Cathy Wood {{in a series of}} interviews. She incrementally leaked out her version of the homicides, portraying Graham as the mastermind and hands-on killer. The investigation led to the exhumation of two nursing home victims who had not been cremated. But when medical examination failed to reveal physical evidence of homicide, not entirely unusual in a smothering case, the county medical examiner nevertheless ruled the deaths homicides, basing it on the interviews Wood had given to the police. Warrants were issued for the arrest of Wood and Graham. On December 4–5, 1988, Graham and Wood were arrested and charged with two murders. Wood was apprehended in Walker; Graham in Tyler, Texas.|$|E
25|$|In August 1998 {{taxi driver}} John Shaw, from Hyde, {{contacted}} the police, informing {{them that he}} suspected Shipman of murdering 21 of his patients. Grundy's daughter, lawyer Angela Woodruff, became concerned when solicitor Brian Burgess informed her that a will had been made, apparently by her mother. There were doubts about its authenticity. The will excluded her and her children, but left £386,000 to Shipman. Burgess told Woodruff to report it, and she <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>police,</b> who began an investigation. Grundy's body was exhumed, and when examined was found to contain traces of diamorphine, often used for pain control in terminal cancer patients. Shipman claimed {{that she was an}} addict and showed them comments in his compuerised medical journal, but a program on his computer showed they were written after her death. Shipman was arrested on 7 September 1998, and was found to own a typewriter of the kind used to make the forged will.|$|E
25|$|On 15 September, Seddon {{went to the}} {{undertaker}} {{and arranged}} a cheap funeral, keeping the small commission for himself. Barrow's burial {{took place in a}} common burial plot, although her family had a vault in Islington. Seddon's later explanation for this was that Barrow's family had snubbed his daughter during an earlier visit and he was not prepared to allow his family to be treated in the same way again, and that if Barrow's family missed the funeral it might teach them better manners for the future. Immediately after the funeral the Seddon family left for Southend for a fortnight's holiday. Barrow's cousin, Frank Vonderahe, suspicious over the suddenness of the death and how quickly the funeral arrangements had been made, arrived to take over possession of her estate. However, Seddon informed him that nothing was left as he had paid the substantial funeral expenses and the cost of Ernest Grant's upkeep himself. The Vonderahe family then <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> and voiced their suspicions. Barrow's body was exhumed on 15 November 1911, and an examination of it by Sir William Willicox, the senior Home Office specialist, and young pathologist Bernard Spilsbury, who had already {{made a name for himself}} in the Crippen case, discovered about two grains of arsenic. As in the Crippen trial, Spilsbury showed himself to be an outstanding witness for the prosecution, easily dealing with cross-examination by the junior defence barrister and demonstrating highly effective forensic techniques.|$|E

500|$|On {{the evening}} of May 30, 2013, Mora and four female volunteers – three from the United States and one from Spain – were patrolling Moín Beach in Limón province, Costa Rica. At {{approximately}} 11:30pm Mora stepped out of his jeep to move a tree trunk and was ambushed by at least five masked men carrying guns. The men drove {{the car with the}} four women to a nearby abandoned house and took their phones, money, and other belongings. [...] Three of the men drove off with Mora. The women were tied up and left in an abandoned house; they eventually freed themselves and <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>police.</b>|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} he was 18, Stroud had made his way to Cordova, Alaska, where he met 36-year-old Kitty O’Brien, a prostitute and dance-hall entertainer, for whom he pimped in Juneau. According to Stroud, on January 18, 1909, while he was away at work, an {{acquaintance}} of theirs, barman F. K. [...] "Charlie" [...] Von Dahmer, had allegedly failed to pay O'Brien for her services and beat her, tearing a locket from her neck that contained a picture of her daughter that was of sentimental value. That night, after finding out about the incident, Stroud confronted Von Dahmer on Gastineau Avenue, and a struggle ensued, resulting in the latter's death from a gunshot wound. Stroud <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> station, and turned himself and the gun in. According to police reports, Stroud had knocked Von Dahmer unconscious, and then shot him at point-blank range.|$|E

Mark liked Kate as she was [...] "a pretty easy-going girl who doesn't let too much get to her", but McGregor told TV Week that Mark was wary of starting a relationship with her because of Declan and his commitment to his work. He was also hesitant because of the age gap between them. McGregor told Holy Soap, [...] "Kate's 19 and my character is about 25. It's funny because a few friends of mine have mentioned it, but I think it's because of what they do and where they are in life. At one point Kate's having driving lessons, and I'm working as a detective who's moved up through the ranks quickly, so we do seem quite different in age, but it's better left unsaid I think!" [...] He added that Mark and Kate's relationship [...] "may not be the easiest of rides." ...|$|E
