5|$|At a young age, Eloise asks Daniel if {{he knows}} what destiny is and then tells him {{that he has a}} special gift — his {{brilliant}} mind — and that his destiny relies on this. After Daniel graduates from Oxford University, Eloise gives him a new journal as a gift and again reminds him of his destiny. Meanwhile, Daniel has received an enormous research grant from Charles, who Daniel does not know is actually his father. Years later, following the crash of Flight 815, Daniel has suffered severe psychological effects from performing experiments on himself; he has lost his mental acuity, and now lives with a caretaker. While <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> coverage of the discovery of the Flight 815 wreckage in the Sunda Trench, Daniel is visited by Charles, who tells him that he faked the found wreckage and that the real plane actually landed on the island. Charles invites Daniel to go to the island, which Charles claims will cure his psychological problems. Eloise later visits Daniel and further encourages him to go to the island.|$|E
5|$|The {{crash was}} only {{accessible}} to vehicles via a single residential street. With {{the surge of}} rescue personnel who converged on the area, the roads leading to the site soon became choked with traffic. Emergency vehicle drivers abandoned their vehicles counter to established policy {{in the course of}} the rescue efforts. This prevented other vehicles from being able to access the crash area. The road was so impassible, many rescue workers left their vehicles miles away and made it to the scene on foot. Fog also grounded rescue helicopters for two hours. As a result, many critically injured survivors were not evacuated until 23:30. Eventually, four helicopters from the New York City Police Aviation Unit evacuated 21 people from the crash site. There were also major problems with communication by rescuers. Radio frequencies became overloaded and authorities on site were unable to make command decisions in some cases. The head of surgery of the Nassau County Medical Center was present at the scene but unable to direct patients to the best locations because many rescuers were radioing the center itself to get advice on where they should send the survivors. Medical professionals on site reported that some hospitals received the most up-to-date information by <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> coverage. Despite these problems, however, only three of the passengers found alive died of their injuries.|$|E

500|$|In a May 8, 2008 {{report on}} the recent actions of Anonymous against Scientology, CNN {{reporter}} Kareen Wynter commented: [...] "Legal experts say the church may be facing its biggest challenge yet – trying to protect its image, in a loosely policed medium seen by millions of people. In a July 2008 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Alan Moore {{had this to say}} about the use of the Guy Fawkes motif, adopted from his comic V for Vendetta: [...] "I was also quite heartened the other day when <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> to see that there were demonstrations outside the Scientology headquarters over here, and that they suddenly flashed to a clip showing all these demonstrators wearing V for Vendetta [...] masks.

Madonna is seen in {{what appears to be a}} post-apocalyptic destroyed city, where there are no signs of life and posters of the Rebel Heart album are shown burning. She looks around and walks carefully among the destruction, while twirling around the cape.|$|E

500|$|On July 11, 2008, Shinoda's second {{public art}} show [...] "Glorious Excess (BORN)" [...] premiered at the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles. The show {{included}} nine new pieces, with an exclusive signing on opening night. The show served as part {{one of the}} two-part [...] "Glorious Excess" [...] series, with the second installment [...] "Glorious Excess (DIES)" [...] due at JANM on August 22, 2009. Shinoda commented on the inspiration behind the Glorious Excess series, stating, [...] "It Got {{to a point where}} the pervasiveness of 'celebrity news' concerned me. It seemed like it has jumped out of its niche into places where it doesn't belong. I would be <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>news,</b> and thinking, 'of all the things {{going on in the world}} right now, why are they covering so-and-so's breakup?' It didn't make sense to me. Add to that the fact that I'm supposed to somehow 'belong' to that celebrity group—and I really don't feel like I do in a lot of ways—and you can see how the topic started to become really interesting to me. The Glorious Excess (BORN) show was my way of diving into those topics, trying to find answers. It follows a central 'celebrity' character, who is filthy rich, slightly violent, and famous without any particular skill or talent." ...|$|E
500|$|Christman {{worked with}} the Office of Special Affairs (OSA) in her efforts to curtail or remove {{material}} critical of Scientology from the press, media, and the Internet. She spent a total of 20 years working for the OSA agency while {{a member of the}} Scientology organization. OSA agents serve as the [...] "internal security force and intelligence unit" [...] within Scientology. Christman assisted OSA agents in 1979, when a politician in Clearwater, Florida was attempting to hinder the Scientology organization's efforts to establish a presence in the city. She was ordered to participate in public meetings, and divert the focus of these events to questioning of the politician, Richard Tenning. He was defeated in a subsequent election, and the Scientology organization proceeded to increase its activities in Clearwater. In 1985, Christman helped OSA agents during a lawsuit from a former Scientology member. She attended the court proceedings and wrote reports about members of the jury, and assisted Scientology lawyers in compiling profiles of the jurors. At the time, Christman was an ardent believer in the Scientology organization and did not question the activities of the OSA agents. Reflecting back on her experiences assisting OSA agents, she commented, [...] "I was in a cult. Scientology promotes not <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>news.</b> It keeps you inside a Truman Show where you're totally unaware of things. It's like your own thinking gets shut down and you get used to not considering anything that might be critical of Scientology." ...|$|E

He listened to their morning talk show host, Herb Elfman, and soon became a devotee. [...] "Boortz bombarded Elfman with calls, reading him little scripts he'd scribbled." [...] While <b>watching</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> one evening, he heard that Elfman had committed suicide. The next morning, Boortz showed up at the front door of WRNG and announced that he was ready to take Elfman's place. Even though the management told him that [...] "they were going to search for a 'qualified' host to take his place", Boortz was offered to be a temporary two-week replacement. In the interim, the evening host was moved to mornings and Boortz hosted the evening. Two weeks later, Boortz was moved to the morning show, embarking on an Atlanta talk radio career that spanned more than forty years.
