Both components can be placed physically far apart on the machine, being connected only by flexible hoses. Hydrostatic drive systems are used on excavators, lawn tractors, forklifts, <b>winch</b> <b>drive</b> systems, heavy lift equipment, agricultural machinery, earth-moving equipment, etc. An arrangement for motor-vehicle transmission was probably used on the Ferguson F-1 P99 racing car in about 1961.|$|E
50|$|The {{main gearbox}} was located behind {{the cabin and}} {{connected}} to the engine clutch housing via a short uni joint shaft (this design enables the so-called flat floor cabin) which was bolted together with the auxiliary gearbox to the backbone tube and formed {{the main part of}} the chassis structure. Options for rear power take off and <b>winch</b> <b>drive</b> were also possible. The main and auxiliary gears were fully synchronized except the first and reverse gear.|$|E
50|$|The prototypes were {{fitted with}} both 'General Service' canvas-covered rear bodies {{or with a}} steel/fibreglass box body.

50|$|The {{main gearbox}} was located behind {{the cabin and}} {{connected}} to the engine clutch housing via a short cardan shaft (this design enables a so-called flat floor cabin.) The main gearbox was bolted to an auxiliary gearbox, to a transfer case {{and then to a}} backbone tube and formed main part of a chassis structure. Options for the rear power take off and or a <b>winch</b> <b>drive</b> were available. Main and auxiliary gears were fully synchronized except the first and reverse gear. The new feature was unique 2-speed planetary overdrive system bolted between front and rear axles.The overdrive could only be selected manually whilst stationary. Auxiliary gearbox had a neutral position which allowed a winch and a power take off to use main gearbox gearing for variable speed operation. The final drives used Tatra gear differentials with locks, offset drive shafts and planetary hub reductions.|$|E

The rack system was deemed too dangerous and so the initial system was shut down; operations ceased on 1 November 1931. The water-driven system was replaced by two electrically driven cabins and reopened on 2 February 1935 after an interruption of more than three years. Traction was provided by a <b>winch</b> <b>driven</b> by a [...] electric motor, allowing a cabin holding fifty people to make the journey in 70 seconds at a speed of [...] The cabins were no longer arranged like a staircase but composed of a single compartment with a horizontal floor.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Warn Industries pioneered the {{development}} of the electric winch for use on a recreational vehicle. Previous to the electric winch, most users of four-wheel drive vehicles utilized a <b>winch</b> <b>driven</b> by a power take-off (PTO) system of hydraulic system. However, PTO and hydraulic winches will not operate if the vehicle is not running. The application of the electric winch would allow for vehicle self recovery, even if the engine had stalled. The first unit sold was initially called the Model 6000 (M6000), although it became known as the Belleview. It had a capacity of 6,000 lbs. In 1974, the company would update its Belleview winch to the M8274, which featured more modern components and an 8,000 lb. capacity.|$|R

5|$|Bonsaint and Scully visit Melissa's home, {{but find}} it unoccupied. Bonsaint tells Scully that Melissa was once {{married to a}} local fisherman, but was widowed when he was inexplicably found dead aboard his fishing boat, the hook on his <b>winch</b> <b>driven</b> through his skull. Later, it is {{revealed}} that he found Chinga in a lobster trap {{and gave it to}} Polly as a present shortly before he died. Bonsaint also explains that there had been an incident between Polly and Jane Froelich, the proprietor of a local daycare center, when Jane slapped Polly over her behavior. Meanwhile, Riggs meets Melissa and Polly at an ice cream shop. Melissa describes how she has seen images of violent deaths, such as Dave's, before they occur. Riggs gives Melissa the key to a remote cabin and suggests that she leave town. When Polly asks one of the workers for more cherries, the worker insists that she needs to pay for them. Just then, the worker is nearly killed when her hair gets caught in the mixer until Riggs saves her.|$|R

5000|$|The Israeli {{government}} were long time users of Dodge vehicles, with many numbers of ex World War Two Dodge Weapons Carriers (Dodge WC series) being used. These were later supplemented by open cabbed Dodge WM 300 and M601 Power Wagons assembled by AIL. In 1970, the M325 Command Car was first produced {{to replace the}} Power Wagons, on classic Dodge M601 chassis with Chrysler components and AIL bodywork. [...] These early production models were characterised by Dodge axles, vertical grille bars and round headlights while later models had horizontal grille bars and square headlights. The later models were fitted with a Chrysler 227 slant-six cylinder 3.7 litre motor, NP 435 4 speed gearbox. The NP transfer case gave a 4.88:1 final drive ratio. The late-model chassis boasted Dana 70 rear axles and Dana 60 front axles with disc brakes and hydraulic-assisted steering. Production-fitted tyres were 9.00x16 Alliance versions of the Michelin. Winch equipped vehicles were fitted with a Braden <b>winch</b> <b>driven</b> from the gearbox power take-off (PTO), while some late production models were fitted with electric Superwinches. The AILs {{are known for their}} superior off-road capabilities with low gearing (82:1), good ground clearance (16 inches) and ample power given by the 3.7 litre Chrysler motor.|$|R

40|$|Fall of 2009, The Cal Poly Aircraft Construction club {{restarted}} Cal Poly 2 ̆ 7 s {{quest for}} the Sikorsky prize. The Sikorsky prize rewards the first a human powered helicopter to sustain controlled hover for one minute without stored energy. Throughout the 1980 ’s, Cal Poly made three attempts; the most successful being the DaVinci III. Also, the DaVinci III was the first ever publically recognized successful human powered helicopter to leave the ground. This scope of this project {{is to improve the}} DaVinci III fuselage and drivetrain for the DaVinci IV. The DaVinci IV adopts the DaVinci III system layout and improves both weight and efficiency. The helicopter will be a single tip driven rotor with a single pilot. The tip propellers will be turned by unspooling thread at the propellers with a winch spool that the rider will be supplying power to. Specifically this document contains the fuselage, rotor hub, and drive train for the DaVinci IV. The fuselage functions as the support structure for the drivetrain and rider. The fuselage will maintain an efficient riding position while providing a rigid structure for the drivetrain to transmit power from the rider to the propellers. The rotor hub will attach the fuselage to the rotor while the rotor rotates above the pilot. The drive train will be a <b>winch</b> <b>driven</b> by the rider’s pedal strokes.

500|$|For {{the filming}} of the actual crash, the car and truck were cabled {{together}} by a <b>winch</b> and <b>driven</b> toward one another. The intention was for a cannon to launch the Impala into the air at the collision point, causing the car to barrel roll as the truck drives away. However, the car became stuck in the truck's bumper, forcing the cannon to fail and the truck {{to go out of}} control. The truck began to jackknife, but the stuntman driving it saved it from flipping. The mistake ended up being beneficial for the scene, as Kripke and director Manners found it to look [...] "pretty real".|$|R
50|$|Most {{variants}} were {{fitted with}} a chassis mounted <b>winch</b> that was <b>driven</b> through the gearbox. This winch, which was intended for maneuvering of the towed field gun and for self-recovery of the vehicle; it proved extremely strong and reliable.

5000|$|ST-26 (ST {{stands for}} saperniy tank or [...] "{{engineer}} tank") — engineer tank; a bridge-laying tank {{based on the}} twin-turreted T-26 mod. 1931 chassis. According to the [...] "System of armoured engineering armament of the Red Army", the ST-26 was developed by designers from the Academy of Military Engineering (chief engineer of the project - Gutman) {{in the beginning of}} 1932. The ST-26 had only one shortened turret {{in the middle of the}} hull armed with a DT tank machine gun with 1,008 rounds; arc of fire was 211°. Special equipment consisted of a metal tracked bridge 7.35 m long and weighing 1100 kg, supports for the bridge (a front frame with two forks and two guiding rollers, lower forks with a hoisting mechanism and a roller, a rear frame with mounts and two rollers) and a cable <b>winch</b> (<b>driven</b> by the tank engine with the use of the reversing gear) inside the vehicle. The ST-26 was intended to provide for crossing of trenches and streams 6 - 6.5 m wide and barriers up to 2 m high by T-27, T-26 and BT light tanks: the bridge had a maximum load rating of 14 t. The bridge could be laid with the help of the cable winch in 25-40 seconds without crew exit; the raising operation took 2-3 min and a commander needed to come out from the vehicle in order to control the process. The ST-26 with its cable system for bridge laying was tested in the summer of 1932.|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{the main}} sources of income for the village include fishing and lace production. Boats are winched up the beach {{as there is no}} harbour, and fresh fish is sold nearby. Nowadays small {{electrically}} <b>driven</b> <b>winches</b> using steel cables or tractors are located on the beach to haul boats in. Higher up is an old manual capstan operated by up to 20 men, now disused.|$|R

The comparative {{studies show that the}} control performance yielded by the FUZZY P+ID controller is superior. We replace the existing PID controller implemented on the towing winch with the FUZZY P + ID controller for burying cable tasks at speed up to 1 knot under sea waves with significant variations (peak-to-peak) from 1. 5 to 2. 5 meters. The real applications demonstrate that the FUZZY P + ID controller is much more robust than the conventional PID controller...|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Polyt V is a plywood covered box structure, {{the pilot}} sitting over the wing {{under a single}} piece, rearward-sliding canopy. An electrically <b>driven</b> <b>winch</b> at the rear retrieves the launch cable, which exits the aircraft at the narrow extreme stern of the fuselage, {{at a rate of}} about 1 m/s. The engine installation is unusual in having a 16 blade adjustable intake cooling fan in the cowling immediately behind the propeller, for low speed high power flight. This additional cooling is automatically blanked off during a dive.|$|R
50|$|The cable lift {{utilizes}} a {{cable loop}} {{in place of}} the traditional chain, which is attached to a short section of chain that engages the trains chain dog. Because a cable is much lighter than a chain, cable lifts are much faster than chain lifts and can be used on much steeper hills - even vertical. A cable also requires far less maintenance than a chain. Another advantage to park guests is that a cable lift is very quiet, partly because the main <b>drive</b> <b>winch</b> is located directly beneath the top of the lift, a location which will normally be relatively far from guest-accessible areas.|$|R
