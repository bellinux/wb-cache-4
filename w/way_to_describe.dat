5|$|In February 2010, the IMA {{announced}} {{the launch of}} IMA Lab, a consulting service within the museum's technology department. IMA Lab was designed to address museum-specific technology needs not currently met by software vendors and to provide consulting services to museums and nonprofit organizations that want to use technology to help solve problems and meet objectives. IMA Lab projects include TAP, steve.museum, and the IMA Dashboard. TAP is a mobile tour application for iPod Touch that presents visitors with content related to the IMA's collection, such as artist interviews, text and audio files, and pictures. Steve.museum, for which IMA Lab is the technical lead, is a project that explores social tagging as a new <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> collections and make them more accessible.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} added, forces can also be {{resolved}} into independent components {{at right angles to}} each other. A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east. Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> forces than using magnitudes and directions. This is because, for orthogonal components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is {{in the same direction as}} one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component. Orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two.|$|E

25|$|Another <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> {{rotations}} {{is using}} rotation quaternions, also called versors. They are equivalent to rotation matrices and rotation vectors. With respect to rotation vectors, {{they can be}} more easily converted to and from matrices. When used to represent orientations, rotation quaternions are typically called orientation quaternions or attitude quaternions.|$|E
25|$|More recently, jet bundles have {{appeared}} as a concise <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> phenomena associated with the derivatives of maps, particularly those associated with the calculus of variations. Consequently, the jet bundle is now recognized as the correct domain for a geometrical covariant field theory and much work is done in general relativistic formulations of fields using this approach.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{this fact}} he {{introduced}} a vectorial <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> any rotation, with a vector on the rotation axis and module {{equal to the}} value of the angle. Therefore, any orientation can be represented by a rotation vector (also called Euler vector) that leads to it from the reference frame. When used to represent an orientation, the rotation vector is commonly called orientation vector, or attitude vector.|$|E

25|$|The {{problem with}} this kind of {{argument}} is just that, in defining the meaning of what is happening in society, {{it is very difficult to}} provide definite scientific proof that this meaning is the objective truth. It remains an interpretation, which may make sense of things at a certain level, without providing the whole truth. Engels's comment illustrates that the concept of character masks is not infrequently used in a polemical <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> a false or inauthentic representation.|$|E
25|$|What is {{generally}} accepted in Buddhism is that effects arise from causation. From {{his very first}} discourse onwards, the Buddha explains the reality of things in terms of cause and effect. The existence of misery and suffering in any given individual {{is due to the}} presence of causes. One <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> the Buddhist eightfold path is a turning towards the reality of things as they are right now and understanding reality directly, although it is debated the degree to which these investigations are metaphysical or epistemological.|$|E
25|$|The Linear eddy {{model is}} a {{technique}} used to simulate the convective mixing {{that takes place in}} turbulent flow. Specifically, it provides a mathematical <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> the interactions of a scalar variable within the vector flow field. It is primarily used in one-dimensional representations of turbulent flow, since it can be applied across a wide range of length scales and Reynolds numbers. This model is generally used as a building block for more complicated flow representations, as it provides high resolution predictions that hold across a large range of flow conditions.|$|E

25|$|In the {{tradition}} of modernism, Lowe uses the grid in selected works. Reflective of works by Sol LeWitt and Eva Hesse, grids are used as representations of mapping systems—a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> environments and landscapes in a two-dimensional way. Native American communities were not traditionally map makers, unlike Europeans and the major land-surveying programs that would invade young America. An {{important part of the}} Manifest Destiny ideal, the grid was used systematically to distribute equal land to colonists. The grid is also symbolic of archeological digs and is seen in major landscape works by Lowe such as Effigy I (1984).|$|E
25|$|For minor scales, {{rotate the}} letters {{counter-clockwise}} by 3, so that, e.g., A minor has 0 sharps or flats and E minor has 1 sharp. (See relative key for details.) A <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> {{this phenomenon is}} that, for any major key , a scale can be built beginning on the sixth (VI) degree (relative minor key, in this case, E) containing the same notes, but from E – E as opposed to G – G. Or, G-major scale (G – A – B – C – D – E – F# – G) is enharmonic (harmonically equivalent) to the e-minor scale (E – F# – G – A – B – C – D – E).|$|E
25|$|This {{leads to}} Maimonides’ notion that God cannot be {{described}} in any positive terms, but rather only in negative conceptions. The Jewish Encyclopedia notes his view that “As to His essence, the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> it is negatively. For instance, He is not physical, nor bound by time, nor subject to change, etc. These assertions do not involve any incorrect notions or assume any deficiency, while if positive essential attributes are admitted {{it may be assumed}} that other things coexisted with Him from eternity.” Unrestrained anthropomorphism and perception of positive attributes is seen as a transgression as serious as idolatry, because both are fundamental errors in the metaphysics of God’s role in the universe, and that is {{the most important aspect of}} the world.|$|E

25|$|Although the U.S. Census Bureau prepares {{population}} {{estimates for}} MSAs, these statistical units {{are defined by}} county borders. Because Massachusetts counties are relatively large and may contain several urban centers, MSAs are an imprecise <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> the state’s urban clusters. For example, Lawrence, Lowell, and Brockton all have closer economic ties with neighboring towns than they do with one another. The Lowell region draws commuters from nearby New Hampshire who might not consider commuting {{all the way to}} Boston. Yet these areas {{are all part of the}} Boston MSA. Similarly, the cities of Leominster and Fitchburg form the core of a distinct urban cluster. Because they lie within Worcester County, however, they are considered part of the Worcester MSA.|$|E
25|$|One theory used to {{describe}} pronominal binding is to use index marking rules to determine possible bindings. Index marking rules are rules used to determine which parts of a sentence carry the same reference. Each element in a sentence is given an index, which is a unique identifier of that element. A set of rules can then be applied to modify the index of one element {{to be the same}} as the index of another. Those two elements will then share the same index, and so will refer to the same thing. This indexing theory was used as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> pronominal binding by Noam Chomsky, and expanded upon by James Higginbotham. The theory holds that the binding of pronouns consists of three main parts.|$|E
25|$|During the 1940s, {{the term}} descarga was {{commonly}} used in the music scenes of Cuba to refer to performances of jazz-influenced boleros in an improvised manner. This {{was part of the}} so-called filin (feeling) movement spearheaded by artists such as José Antonio Méndez, César Portillo de la Luz, and Luis Yánez. This style was inherited by musicians such as Bebo Valdés and Frank Emilio Flynn who explored the combination of jazz and Cuban forms into the 1950s. In particular, Bebo's 1952 session with producer Norman Granz in Havana, credited to Andre's All Stars, is often cited as a milestone in the development of Cuban jazz, and by extension, descarga. At this time, however, the term descarga began to be used in a different <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> jam sessions based on the son montuno and other Afro-Cuban rhythms. The incipient mambo and Afro-Cuban jazz scene found in New York during the 1940s was also a catalyst of the development of descargas, with artists such as Machito, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker and Tito Puente performing extended jams with Afro-Cuban motifs.|$|E
