[...] He commented that the album contains [...] "some truly mind-bending and aggressively awkward Beefheartian experimentation.

50|$|The village’s and municipality’s name is Gutenberg - nowadays. However, {{even looking}} at a modern map of the local area, the peruser will be struck by one rural lane’s name: Weithersheimer Weg. As is so for so many roads, lanes and streets in Germany, this one is named after a place, in this case one called Weithersheim (likewise, the road leading out of Gutenberg towards {{neighbouring}} Roxheim is called Roxheimer Straße). Nevertheless, one can search far and wide and never find a place on any map called Weithersheim. The ending —heim suggests {{that it would have}} arisen as a Frankish village. In 1158, a place named Weihersheim had its first documentary mention. On 22 May of that year, Archbishop of Mainz Arnold specially confirmed to the convent of Ruppertsberg near Bingen its landholds as they were donated to the same by individual persons. Mentioned among other things were four manors at Weithersheim. This convent had been founded in 1149 by Saint Hildegard, who herself had grown up at Disibodenberg. Once again, in 1184, a place called Wertdersheim cropped up in a document. Pope Lucius III therein likewise confirmed the donations to that same convent and along with them papal protection. In 1187, Wertdersheim appeared {{for the third time in}} a document that likewise dealt with the Ruppertsberg convent. Archbishop Cunrad of Mainz, a papal legate, freed the convent from taxes and furnished it with specific rights. Hitherto the reader gathers that there was some village that bore the name Weithersheim, but <b>where</b> <b>did</b> <b>this</b> lie? A clue as to the answer comes from yet another document, this one from the monastery at Bingen. It bears the title Registratio rerum et censum monasterii S. Rupperti ab anno 1147 usque 1270 and comprehensively lists all the convent’s landholds. With regard to Weithersheim, 53 rural areas are named. Among others, it names “in hahnebach” and “in demo sewe”, names that would mean something quite definite to the local modern winegrowers. Modern maps even show these same cadastral names within Gutenberg’s limits, in modified or even the same forms as they had in the 13th century. The nuns who wrote this directory are to be thanked for not translating the German field names into Latin. Interesting, however, is that the locality name “retro ecclesiam” also crops up, which is indeed Latin. There was already a church at this time, Saint Margaret’s (Kirche St. Margarete), which stood somewhat more to the northeast than today’s church. Thus, the answer to the question would seem to be that the mysterious Weithersheim is none other than Gutenberg, and that sometime in the village’s long history, its name was changed. It was once assumed that Weithersheim had been a village on the Butterberg that was later forsaken for a newer village called Gutenberg down in the dale. Hochgesand’s discoveries at the Butterberg (see above), however, hardly lend that assumption any credibility, for all his finds were either prehistoric or Roman, and never mediaeval. Furthermore, a temporal overlap in the use of the two names may be noted. Records from Eberbach Abbey and Ruppertsberg, both of which had landholds at Gutenberg, kept referring to the village as Weithersheim long after those from the Counts of Sponheim had begun using the names Burg Gutenberg and Tal Gutenberg (“castle” and “dale”), thus putting the lie to any notion that Weithersheim was given up and Gutenberg then built to replace it.|$|E
