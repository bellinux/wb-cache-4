40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{investigated}} {{the feasibility of}} breeding for phenotypes predicted from video image analysis (VIA). In meat factories in Ireland, digital images are routinely taken after slaughter to derive EUROP conformation and fat grades. Two datasets (1, 048 carcasses in total) on individual carcass dissections were made available for this study, one by a research center and the other by a commercial partner. Dissection data consisted of eight and six primal cuts taken in the hind- and fore-quarter, respectively, and analyses revealed significant genetic variations in these data. Heritabilities of primal cut weights ranged from 0. 03 to 0. 83 in the fore-quarter cuts, and from 0. 14 to 0. 86 in the hind-quarter cuts. Primal cut weights were subsequently grouped into four <b>wholesale</b> <b>cut</b> weights according to their retail values: lower value cuts, medium value cuts, high value cuts, and very high value cuts. Equations to predict <b>wholesale</b> <b>cut</b> weights were subsequently derived from VIA image parameters. Accuracy of prediction were > 0. 84 and > 0. 72 in the steer and heifer datasets, respectively. Genetic analysis of the <b>wholesale</b> <b>cut</b> weights predicted in a large national dataset of steers and heifers revealed heritabilities of 0. 18, 0. 27, 0. 40, and 0. 17 for lower value cuts, medium value cuts, high value cuts, and very high value cuts, respectively. Genetic correlations among predicted <b>wholesale</b> <b>cut</b> weights ranged from 0. 45 to 0. 89 across genders. Predicted <b>wholesale</b> <b>cut</b> weights were also strongly genetically correlated with animal price at weaning age (0. 37 to 0. 66), as well as price at postweaning age (0. 50 to 0. 67) suggesting a benefit of indirect selection especially where data on carcass cut weights were not yet available. Including predicted <b>wholesale</b> <b>cut</b> weights in a selection criteria increased genetic gain for carcass traits {{over and above the}} current selection practice of selection on EUROP conformation score. Expanding knowledge on <b>wholesale</b> <b>cut</b> weights and extending it to meat quality traits is an attractive option for Ireland...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify the genetic associations between a range of carcass-related traits including <b>wholesale</b> <b>cut</b> weights predicted from video image analysis (VIA) technology, and a range of pre-slaughter performance traits in commercial Irish cattle. Predicted carcass cut weights comprised of cut weights based on retail value: lower value cuts (LVC), medium value cuts (MVC), high value cuts (HVC) and very high value cuts (VHVC), as well as total meat, fat and bone weights. Four main sources of data were used in the genetic analyses: price data of live animals collected from livestock auctions, live-weight data and linear type collected from both commercial and pedigree farms as well as from livestock auctions and weanling quality recorded on-farm. Heritability of carcass cut weights ranged from 0. 21 to 0. 39. Genetic correlations between the cut traits and the other performance traits were estimated using a series of bivariate sire linear mixed models where carcass cut weights were phenotypically adjusted to a constant carcass weight. Strongest positive genetic correlations were obtained between predicted carcass cut weights and carcass value (min rg(MVC) 50. 35; max rg(VHVC) 50. 69), and animal price at both weaning (min rg(MVC) 50. 37; max rg(VHVC) 50. 66) and post weaning (min rg(MVC) 50. 50; max rg(VHVC) 50. 67). Moderate genetic correlations were obtained between carcass cut weights and calf price (min rg(HVC) 50. 34; max rg(LVC) 50. 45), weanling quality (min rg(MVC) 50. 12; max rg(VHVC) 50. 49), linear scores for muscularity at both weaning (hindquarter development: min rg(MVC) 520. 06; max rg(VHVC) 50. 46), post weaning (hindquarter development: min rg(MVC) 50. 23; max rg(VHVC) 50. 44). The genetic correlations between total meat weight were consistent with those observed with the predicted <b>wholesale</b> <b>cut</b> weights. Total fat and total bone weights were generally negatively correlated with carcass value, auction prices and weanling quality. Total bone weight was, however, positively correlated with skeletal scores at weaning and post weaning. These results indicate that some traits collected early in life are moderate-to-strongly correlated with carcass cut weights predicted from VIA technology. This information can be used to improve the accuracy of selection for carcass cut weights in national genetic evaluations. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify the genetic variation in carcass cuts predicted using digital image analysis in commercial cross-bred cattle. The data set comprised 38 404 steers and 14 318 heifers from commercial Irish herds. The traits investigated included the weights of lower value cuts (LVC), medium value cuts (MVC), high value cuts (HVC), very high value cuts (VHVC) and total meat weight. In addition, the weights of total fat and total bones were available on the steers. Heritability of carcass cut weights, within gender, was estimated using an animal linear model, whereas genetic and phenotypic correlations among cuts were estimated using a sire linear model. Carcass weight was included as a covariate in all models. In the steers, heritability ranged from 0. 13 (s. e. 50. 02) for VHVC to 0. 49 (s. e. 50. 03) for total bone weight, and in the heifers heritability ranged from 0. 15 (s. e. 50. 04) for MVC to 0. 72 (s. e. 50. 06) for total meat weight. The coefficient of genetic variation for the different cuts varied from 1. 4 % to 3. 6 %. Genetic correlations between the different cut weights were all positive and ranged from 0. 45 (s. e. 50. 08) to 0. 89 (s. e. 50. 03) in the steers, and from 0. 47 (s. e. 50. 14) to 0. 82 (s. e. 50. 06) in the heifers. Genetic correlations between the <b>wholesale</b> <b>cut</b> weights and carcass conformation ranged from 0. 32 (s. e. 50. 06) to 0. 45 (s. e. 50. 07) in the steers, and from 0. 10 (s. e. 50. 12) to 0. 38 (s. e. 50. 09) in the heifers. Genetic correlations between the same <b>wholesale</b> <b>cut</b> traits in steers and heifers ranged from 0. 54 (s. e. 50. 14) for MVC to 0. 79 (s. e. 50. 06) for total meat weight; genetic correlations between carcass weight and carcass classification for conformation and fat score in both genders varied from 0. 80 to 0. 87. The existence of genetic variation in carcass cut traits, coupled with the routine availability of predicted cut weights from digital image analysis, clearly shows the potential to genetically improve carcass value. peer-reviewe...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted on}} beef carcasses, aimed at identifying the growth patterns of wholesale cuts and their tissues in steer during fattening phase. This study involved 69 grass-fed steers with a live-weight range of 300 to 600 kg. They had entered, or were progressing along, their fat deposition phase. An allometric model (Huxley, 1932) was used to study the growth patterns of carcass tissues within wholesale cuts. In general, The growths of muscle and fat within wholesale cuts followed similar patterns. Some differences in growth patterns between muscle and fat were identified on the dorsal region. The growth impetus for fat moved from the thoracic backwards to the lumbar region which was the reverse of the growth impetus for muscle. Differential growth patterns occurred between intermuscular (IM) fat and subcutaneous (SC) fat. With IM fat, its growth movement {{was similar to that}} of total fat where there was a concentration of growth in the lumbar area and thin flank as side weight increased.

40|$|Mature {{pregnant}} crossbred ewes (n = 90) {{were used}} in a randomized complete block design experiment and were assigned to 1 of 3 winter-feeding systems differing in primary feed source: haylage (HL), limit-fed corn (CN), or limit-fed dried distillers grains (DDGS). Effects of these winter-feeding strategies on postweaning progeny performance were determined. Lamb progeny (n = 96) were weaned at 61 +/- 4 d of age and fed a common high-concentrate diet. Lambs were assigned to feedlot pen (n = 18) based on dam mid-gestation pen. Growth rate, DMI, and ADG were determined for the first 40 d of the finishing period. At 96 +/- 4 d of age, 1 wether lamb was randomly selected from each pen (n = 18) for a glucose tolerance test. The experiment was terminated, and lambs were slaughtered individually when they were determined to have achieved 0. 6 -cm 12 th-rib fat thickness. After a 24 -h chill, carcass data were collected and a 2. 54 -cm chop was removed from each lamb from the LM posterior to the 12 th rib for ether extract analysis. Additional carcass measurements of bone, muscle, and fat from the shoulder, rack, loin, and leg were collected on 35 carcasses. At weaning, lamb BW was not different among treatments, whereas final BW tended to be greater (P = 0. 09) for lambs from ewes fed DDGS and CN during gestation than from those fed HL. Overall lamb growth rate from birth to slaughter was not different among treatments. Lambs from ewes fed DDGS vs. CN or HL tended {{to have a greater}} initial insulin response (P = 0. 09). Dressing percent was less (P = 0. 04) in lambs from ewes fed DDGS, but no difference (P = 0. 16) was detected in HCW among treatments. As expected, 12 th rib fat thickness was similar among treatments, whereas LM area was largest to smallest (P = 0. 05) in lambs from ewes fed CN, HL, and DDGS, respectively. Proportion of internal fat tended to be greatest to smallest (P = 0. 06) in lambs from ewes fed DDGS, CN, and HL, respectively. Calculated boneless trimmed retail cuts percentage was less (P = 0. 04) in lambs from ewes fed DDGS than CN or HL. Loin muscle weight as a percentage of <b>wholesale</b> <b>cut</b> tended (P = 0. 10) to be greater in lambs from ewes fed CN and HL than DDGS, whereas other muscle, bone, and fat weights and proportions were similar (P > 0. 24) among treatments. Prepartum diet during mid to late gestation of ewes altered postnatal fat and muscle deposition and may be associated with alterations in insulin sensitivity of progeny...|$|E

A feeding trial {{was conducted to}} evaluate feed efficiency, average daily gain, feed cost per pound of gain, wool growth per day and per pound of grain, and average wool fiber diameter and distribution of fiber population of the wool. Lambs were raised to a uniform market weight of between 115 and 125 pounds and slaughtered to evaluate carcass weight, backfat thickness, loin eye area, internal body fat, leg circumference, dressing percentage, untrimmed <b>wholesale</b> <b>cuts,</b> trimmed retail cuts, and yield and quality grades.

40|$|Twelve {{intact and}} 12 docked Najdi lambs of {{equal numbers of}} males and females were {{utilized}} in the experiment. Upon attaining 40 kg fasted and shorn body weight the lambs were slaughtered and their carcasses were dissected into <b>wholesale</b> <b>cuts.</b> Each cut was then dissected into lean, fat and bone, which were weighed separately. The data showed that docked lambs were 19 days earlier in attaining the designated slaughter body weight and produced carcasses with 1. 33 and 0. 20 kg more weights in primal and rough cuts, respectively, compared to intact lambs. Also, the total separable lean weigh in primal cuts was heavier for the docked lambs in comparison to intact lambs which reflected significant differences (P< 0. 05) in lean weight from wholesale loin and rack cuts. Non-significant differences were observed for the amounts of separable fat deposited in each cut between docked and intacy lambs except for <b>wholesale</b> leg <b>cut.</b> No significant differences were detected between the docked and intact groups for bone weight in each cut...|$|R
40|$|This study aimed towards {{comparison}} of carcass characteristics, <b>wholesale</b> <b>cuts</b> yield, body components and meat chemical composition {{and quality of}} two sub-types of Baggara cattle namely Nyalawi and Rizagi. Eighteen animals comprising nine from each type were used. These animals were of similar nutritional background, age and sex. No {{significant differences between the}} two types in carcass yield and other characteristics as dressing percentage were found. Nyalawi cattle sub-type produced heavier or significantly heavier <b>wholesale</b> <b>cuts</b> as thick flank, thick ribs, chuck and brisket. Carcass composition indicated that the fat and bone percentages were greater in Nyalawi cattle carcasses, however muscle: bone and muscle: fat ratios were greater in Rizagi cattle carcasses. Body components revealed that Nyalawi cattle sub-type had heavier rumen, reticulum and omasum while omental fat and reproductive organs were heavier in Rizagi cattle. Other body components were almost similar in the two types of cattle. Meat chemical composition indicated significantly high (P< 0. 01) protein and sarcoplasmic proteins and non protein nitrogen in Nyalawi cattle type. Meat colour readings gave significantly (P< 0. 01) high lightness (L) in meat from Rizagi cattle, while it was significantly high (P< 0. 001) redness values (a) were found in Nyalawi cattle meat. No significant differences were found between the two cattle sub types in subjective meat quality evaluation yet Rizagi cattle meat was rated x higher in overall acceptability than Nyalawi cattle meat. No {{significant differences between the two}} cattle types in carcass measurements were found but Nyalawi cattle type tended to have longer carcasses and legs, larger L. dorsi area and barrel circumference. Rizagi cattle type tended to have larger chest circumference, leg circumference and back fat thickness...|$|R
40|$|A {{trial was}} carried out using 290 pigs of 16 genetic types, 128 gilts and 162 barrows, {{produced}} from Italian Large White (LW), Belgian Landrace (BL) × LW, Duroc (DU) × LW and Spotted Poland (SP) × LW sows inseminated by LW, BL, DU and SP boars. The {{aim of the research}} was to estimate direct heterosis and breed additive effects on growth performance, carcass traits and <b>wholesale</b> <b>cuts</b> when slaughter weight averaged 145 kg; the breed additive effects are expressed as differences from purebred LW. The BL breed had a negative effect on postweaning growth rate (− 42 g/d, P< 0. 10), but favourably affected commercial carcass composition (+ 2. 7 % lean joints, P< 0. 05) and <b>wholesale</b> <b>cuts</b> (+ 1. 4 % ham, P< 0. 01) compared to LW. The DU breed additive effect improved average daily gain (+ 34 g/d, P< 0. 10) and positively influenced carcass composition, with higher yield and incidence of total lean joints (+ 1. 9 %, P< 0. 10) and ham (+ 1. 6 %, P< 0. 01). The SP breed additive effect did not affect growth, but gave less percentage weight of total lean joints (− 3. 7 %, P< 0. 01) and more total percentage weight of fatty joints (+ 4. 1 %, P< 0. 01) than LW. Direct heterosis positively influenced postweaning growth rate (+ 34 g/d, P< 0. 05) but was small and not significant for most carcass traits. The DU breed offers some advantages in crossbreeding plans involving LW to produce heavy industrial pigs; BL can also be utilized for this purpose, with less favourable results, while the SP breed does not seem suitable for heavy pig production...|$|R
40|$|Pasak Bumi (Eurycoma longifolia Jack/ELJ) is {{frequently}} claimmed to increase expression of masculinity, including inducing the lean growth. This study was aimed {{to determine the}} effect of ELJ peptide supplementation on yield and physical composition of lamb carcasses. Sixteen Priangan rams about 1 year old with average weight of 30. 43 ± 1. 41 kg were maintained in individual cages. The experimental rams were divided into 4 treatments i. e. T 0, T 1, T 2, and T 3. In T 0, T 1 and T 2 treatments, the experimental rams were administered: 0, 1. 5, and 3 mg ELJ peptide/kg BW, respectively. In the T 3 treatment, the experimental ram were administered 1 mg/kg commercial product eurypeptide®. The ELJ peptide and commercial product were administered first in the morning prior to feeding. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design of four treatments and four replications. Data were covariance analyzed with an empty body weight as covariate for carcass weight and the right carcass weight as covariate for carcasses physical composition. The results showed that the weights of dissection body fat of T 2 and T 3 were lower than T 0 (P < 0. 05) and T 1 (P < 0. 01). Fat weight reduction was found {{in all parts of the}} carcass and more apparent in the fore saddle. Lean weights were higher (P < 0. 05) in T 3 and T 2 as compared to T 1 and T 0. The pattern of lean weight differed among treatments in the <b>wholesale</b> <b>cuts</b> that follow the total lean weight eventhough it was not significant. ELJ peptide treatment did not significantly affect either bone weight or <b>wholesale</b> <b>cuts</b> weight. In conclusion, T 2 and T 3 can improve carcass composition with equal ability...|$|R
