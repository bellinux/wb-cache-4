5000|$|The {{problem can}} be {{expressed}} as follows. Suppose that a sea-battle will not <b>be</b> <b>fought</b> tomorrow. Then it was also true yesterday (and the week before, and last year) {{that it will not}} <b>be</b> <b>fought,</b> since any true statement about what will be the case in the future was also true in the past. But all past truths are now necessary truths; therefore it is now necessarily true in the past, prior and up to the original statement [...] "A sea battle will not <b>be</b> <b>fought</b> tomorrow", that the battle will not <b>be</b> <b>fought,</b> and thus the statement that it will <b>be</b> <b>fought</b> <b>is</b> necessarily false. Therefore, it is not possible that the battle will <b>be</b> <b>fought.</b> In general, if something will not be the case, it is not possible for it to be the case. [...] "For a man may predict an event ten thousand years beforehand, and another may predict the reverse; that which was truly predicted at the moment in the past will of necessity take place in the fullness of time" [...] (De Int. 18b35).|$|R
