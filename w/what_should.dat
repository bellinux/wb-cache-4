5|$|The author {{believes}} that determinations of <b>what</b> <b>should</b> be censored from whom {{should not be}} made by the government, stressing that a society must ensure that there is a tangible negative impact on youth from certain material before imposing censorship. She writes that it becomes incredibly difficult to characterize specifically <b>what</b> <b>should</b> and should not be censored, resulting in negative overreaching consequences of censorship. Heins advises the impact on society from censorship could be so great that censors should be sure there is real actual harm rather than imagined harm prior to enacting restrictive laws regulating indecency or the Internet.|$|E

5|$|The {{change in}} the series' setting became an issue in later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious. Starting with the second game, the series {{localization}} direction has been handled by Janet Hsu; One of the first decisions {{she had to make}} was how to localize Maya's hometown and the mysticism of the Fey clan. She {{came up with the idea}} that the localized versions of the Ace Attorney games take place in Los Angeles in an alternative universe where anti-Japanese laws like the California Alien Land Law of 1913 were not passed, anti-Japanese sentiments were not powerful, and where Japanese culture flourished. This dictated <b>what</b> <b>should</b> be localized and <b>what</b> <b>should</b> be kept Japanese; things relating to the Fey clan and the Kurain channeling technique were kept Japanese, as that was Maya's heritage, while Japanese foods that were not widely known in the West were changed.|$|E

5|$|Gray abhorred slavery.

However, he was not sure <b>what</b> <b>should</b> be done with the freed slaves. This was another area where Gray and Agassiz disagreed; Agassiz felt each race had different origins.|$|E

Anatoly Artsebarsky argued that Mir should be kept because he believed that once it had been deorbited, the US would try to marginalise Russian involvement in the ISS. An online opinion poll showed 67% support worldwide for keeping it in orbit.|$|E
5|$|All such {{episodes of}} severe drought {{correlate}} with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. El Niño-related droughts {{have also been}} implicated in periodic declines in Indian agricultural output. Nevertheless, ENSO events that have coincided with abnormally high sea surfaces temperatures in the Indian Ocean—in one instance during 1997 and 1998 by up to —have resulted in increased oceanic evaporation, resulting in unusually wet weather across India. Such anomalies have occurred during a sustained warm spell {{that began in the}} 1990s. A contrasting phenomenon is that, instead of the usual high pressure air mass over the southern Indian Ocean, an ENSO-related oceanic low pressure convergence centre forms; it then continually pulls dry air from Central Asia, desiccating India during <b>what</b> <b>should</b> have been the humid summer monsoon season. This reversed air flow causes India's droughts. The extent that an ENSO event raises sea surface temperatures in the central Pacific Ocean influences the extent of drought.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} codes, Han law distinguished <b>what</b> <b>should</b> be considered murderous killings (with malice and foresight), wittingly killing, killing by mistake, and killing by accident. Although a {{father was the}} undisputed head of the family, he {{was not allowed to}} mutilate or kill any of its members as punishment; if he did, he would be tried for physical assault or murder, respectively. Yet not all murders were given the same sentence, since relation and circumstance were considered in the sentencing. For example, A father would be given a much less severe sentence for murdering a son than if a son murdered his father. Women had certain rights under Han law. It was against the law for husbands to physically abuse their wives. Rape cases were also commonly filed in court and were punished by Han law. Women could level charges against men in court, while it was commonly accepted in Han jurisprudence that women were capable of telling the truth in court.|$|E
