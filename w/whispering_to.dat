25|$|The {{concept of}} Shayataun (devils/satans) in Islam {{parallels}} the Christian concept of demons and was probably introduced together with angels to Arabian lore by Islam. They are hold {{to be the}} servants of Iblis, who was, like in Christian thought, banished from heaven. If Iblis himself was originally an Angel or a Jinni is controversial in Islamic belief, yet after his fall, he turned into a Shaitan and then fathered the Shayateen. The Shayateen do not die until the last day and can not become believers, therefore they are always evil, seeking for leading humans astray from God, by <b>whispering</b> <b>to</b> the hearts. Furthermore, the term Shaitan and Jinn may overlap, since an evil Jinni is also called Shaitan, like evil humans may also be called Shaitan if they {{are considered to be}} purely evil.|$|E
500|$|From the cobbler Gulam's {{assertion}} that the woodcutter Alibaba had become wealthy overnight, Abu Hussain realises that it is Alibaba who discovered the secret of his cave, but kills the cobbler afterwards. Having his men hide inside barrels, Abu Hussain comes to Alibaba's house disguised as an oil merchant seeking shelter for the night. However, Marziana overhears him <b>whispering</b> <b>to</b> his men, and realises his true identity. When she dances at a banquet Alibaba hosts in honour of the guest, Dowlath and Bulbul roll the barrels one by one into the swirling waters as per the plan. After Marziana tries unsuccessfully to stab the [...] "oil merchant", she exposes him as Abu Hussain; Alibaba is shocked. This leads to a fight between the two men, which results in Abu Hussain kidnapping Marziana and fleeing to the cave. Alibaba chases him and reaches the cave where he kills Abu Hussain after an intense battle. After Alibaba rescues Marziana, they marry and continue to perform social work.|$|E
500|$|When Charles {{became ill}} in the 1390s, Isabeau was 22; {{she had three}} {{children}} and had already lost two infants. During the worst of his illness Charles was unable to recognize her, and caused her great distress by demanding her removal when she entered his chamber. The Monk of St Denis wrote in his chronicle, [...] "What distressed her above all was to see how on all occasions... the king repulsed her, <b>whispering</b> <b>to</b> his people, 'Who is this woman obstructing my view? Find out what she wants and stop her from annoying and bothering me. As his illness worsened {{at the turn of}} the century, she was accused of abandoning him, particularly when she moved her residence to the Hôtel Barbette. Historian Rachel Gibbons speculates that Isabeau wanted to distance herself from her husband and his illness, writing, [...] "it would be unjust to blame her if she did not want to live with a madman." ...|$|E

After her first performance of the song on Unplugged on the Country Music Television, McEntire also performed the song at the Country Music Association (CMA) awards on November 10, 2010. Mawuse Ziegbe of MTV News praised her cover, writing, [...] "Singing with no band onstage, donning a glittery black dress with her signature red hair flowing to her shoulders, the legendary vocalist's performance scored a standing ovation." [...] Jillian Mapes and Megan Vick of Billboard praised the performance, writing, [...] "As if Beyonce's 2008 ballad 'If I Were a Boy' wasn't moving enough, country queen Reba McEntire's smokey twang and solemn stance turned the song on its head." [...] They {{also noted that the}} simple and powerful performance [...] "is enough to inspire tears, or at least goosebumps." [...] Country Music Television's Chet Flippo felt that McEntire's performance was [...] "the musical highlight of the evening" [...] and added that it was [...] "a lesson of what country music should be striving for these days". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times gave a mixed review of her performance, writing that [...] " [...] did something unexpected, softening her delivery and finding the creases in the song, as if Beyoncé were <b>whispering</b> <b>to</b> her from the wings." [...] However, Entertainment Weeklys Mandi Bierly wrote that the lyrics were [...] "just too young for , {{and when it comes to}} the chorus, I want someone to belt it".|$|E

2500|$|While [...] "Shaitan" [...] {{with the}} {{definite}} article [...] "Al" [...] in islamic usage commonly {{refers to the}} particular Shaitan Iblis; the term also apply to [...] other creatures and things including jinn and human ("al-ins", الإنس). Furthermore the [...] "Shayateen" [...] are a class of creatures distinguished from the aforementioned. [...] "Shayateen" [...] (translated as [...] "devils", [...] "satans" [...] or [...] "demons") are the offspring and servants of Iblis and in some traditions fallen angels, who sided with Iblis. They help Iblis to mislead humans and jinn by <b>whispering</b> <b>to</b> their hearts. Unlike jinn, which have a limited lifespan like humans, they will only die together with Iblis, when the world perishes. Jinn are created from the blaze of fire; the shayateen come from the smoke of fire and created {{as a result of}} bad actions. Additionally, the Shayateen are, unlike the jinn, always evil and not able to gain heavenly bliss. The Ifrits (an infernal class of shayateen) {{are one of the most}} powerful classes of shayateen.|$|E
2500|$|The Velveteen Rabbit or How Toys Become Real was Margery Williams Bianco's first American work, and {{it remains}} her most famous. It has {{remained}} a classic piece of literature through numerous adaptations in children's theatre {{as well as on}} radio, television and in the movies. The author's trademark undercurrents of sentimentality and sadness persist in the tale of a small boy who finds a velveteen rabbit in his Christmas stocking. The boy quickly discards the toy after playing with it for a few hours in the bustle of Christmas and relatives. [...] In the nursery the rabbit is looked down on by the fancier wind up toys. He asks the skin horse, [...] "What is Real?" [...] The skin horse tells him, [...] "When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real." [...] The boy comes to adore the rabbit, and they are constant companions. This happy existence continues until the boy contracts scarlet fever. [...] The rabbit stays with him, <b>whispering</b> <b>to</b> him of the games they will play again when he is better. [...] As the boy gets better his family prepares {{to take him to the}} seaside. Although the rabbit looks forward to the seaside very much, the doctor insists he be thrown out and burned along with the other toys that may be infected. While the rabbit is waiting to be burned, he cries a real tear, from which a fairy emerges. The fairy tells the rabbit that he was real to the boy, because the boy loved him, but now she will make him truly real. [...] Later, the boy sees a real rabbit in the garden. [...] He thinks it looks like his old rabbit, but he does not know that it really is the velveteen rabbit he once loved.|$|E
