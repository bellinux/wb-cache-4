5|$|A {{second factor}} which {{contributes}} to a concentrated jet, that is more applicable to the subtropical jet, which forms at the poleward limit of the tropical Hadley cell and to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude. Tropical air rises to the tropopause, and moves poleward before sinking; this is the Hadley cell circulation. As it does so it tends to conserve angular momentum, since friction with the ground is significant. Air masses that begin moving poleward are deflected eastward by the Coriolis force (true for either hemisphere), <b>which</b> <b>for</b> poleward moving air implies an increased eastward component of the winds (note that leftward deflection in the southern hemisphere).|$|E
5|$|A snap {{election}} was called, with Bruce taking {{his case to}} the people that dramatic action on industrial relations was needed. Opposition Leader Scullin forcefully attacked the government, blaming the Prime Minister for an industrial environment that was adversarial and punitive, stressing that Commonwealth arbitration had safeguarded many rights of workers and was completely workable with conciliation and proper consultation. Scullin also criticised the government for the growing debt problem and economic malaise, <b>which</b> <b>for</b> some years he had predicted would lead to a major economic crisis.|$|E
5|$|Although the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia share English as {{a common}} oral and written language, ASL is not {{mutually}} intelligible with British Sign Language (BSL) or Auslan. All three languages show degrees of borrowing from English, but this alone is not sufficient for cross-language comprehension. It {{has been found that}} a relatively high percentage (37–44%) of ASL signs have similar translations in Auslan, <b>which</b> <b>for</b> oral languages would suggest that they belong to the same language family. However, this does not seem justified historically for ASL and Auslan, and it is likely that this resemblance is due to the higher degree of iconicity in sign languages in general, as well as contact with English.|$|E

5|$|Compared {{with other}} BBC series {{broadcast}} in the 1960s, Doctor Who is well-represented in surviving episodes. Of the 253 episodes broadcast during the 1960s, 156 still exist – mainly due to copies produced for overseas sales. For example, Seasons 1 and 2, {{the most widely}} sold abroad of the 1960s era, are missing only 9 and 2 episodes, respectively. By contrast, the less well-sold Seasons 4 and 5 respectively have none and two complete serials between them, The Tomb of the Cybermen and The Enemy of the World from season five. Doctor Whos popularity and high-profile have also helped to ensure the return of episodes <b>which,</b> <b>for</b> other less well-remembered programmes, might never have occurred.|$|E
