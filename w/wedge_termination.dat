40|$|A compact {{range is}} a {{facility}} {{used for the}} measurement of antenna radiation and target scattering problems. Most presently available parabolic reflectors do not produce ideal uniform plane waves in the target zone. Design improvements are suggested to reduce the amplitude taper, ripple and cross polarization errors. The ripple caused by diffractions from the reflector edges can be reduced by adding blended rolled edges and shaping the edge contour. Since the reflected edge continues smoothly from the parabola onto the rolled surface, rather than being abruptly terminated, the discontinuity in the reflected field is reduced which results in weaker diffracted fields. This is done by blending the rolled edges from the parabola into an ellipse. An algorithm which enables one to design optimum blended rolled edges was developed {{that is based on}} an analysis of the continuity of the surface radius of curvature and its derivatives across the junction. Futhermore, a concave edge contour results in a divergent diffracted ray pattern and hence less stray energy in the target zone. Design equations for three-dimensional reflectors are given. Various examples were analyzed using a new physical optics method which eliminates the effects of the false scattering centers on the incident shadow boundaries. A Gregorian subreflector system, in which both the subreflector and feed axes are tilted, results in a substantial reduction in the amplitude taper and cross polarization errors. A dual chamber configuration is proposed to eliminate the effects of diffraction from the subreflector and spillover from the feed. A computationally efficient technique, based on ray tracing and aperture integration, was developed to analyze the scattering from a lossy dielectric slab with a <b>wedge</b> <b>termination...</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>wedge</b> socket <b>termination</b> {{is useful}} when the fitting {{needs to be}} {{replaced}} frequently. For example, if {{the end of a}} wire rope is in a high-wear region, the rope may be periodically trimmed, requiring the termination hardware to be removed and reapplied. An example of this is on the ends of the drag ropes on a dragline. The end loop of the wire rope enters a tapered opening in the socket, wrapped around a separate component called the wedge. The arrangement is knocked in place, and load gradually eased onto the rope. As the load increases on the wire rope, the wedge become more secure, gripping the rope tighter.|$|R
40|$|The 26 December 2004 Mw 9. 3 Sumatra to Andaman Islands {{subduction}} zone earth-quake {{was the second}} largest earthquake recorded. The tsunami generated by the earthquake caused the loss of ~ 300, 000 lives and devastation of many Indian Ocean coastalcommunities. The Royal Navy's HMS Scott conducted a bathymetric survey over the rupture zone during early 2005. This {{is the first time}} a high resolution deep-waterseafloor survey has been carried out so soon after an earthquake of this magnitude. Existing geophysical data in the earthquake rupture zone are rare and therefore thegeneral {{subduction zone}} structure is poorly known. Data were collected in the southern and intial part of the rupture zone offshore Sumatra, including the plate boundaryand lower accretionary <b>wedge,</b> the southern <b>termination</b> of the earthquake rupture and probable segment boundary, and parts of the forearc basin and outer arc high system. The data reveal the gross morphology of the margin and details of the structural geometry and ongoing sedimentary processes.

40|$|A new {{regional}} seismic {{section in the}} Ionian Sea across the Apennines belt and related foreland shows how the present foredeep geometry may be an example for interpreting discontinuous, tilted and deformed earlier basins now incorporated in the internal parts of the accretionary <b>wedge.</b> Onlap stratal <b>terminations</b> of the foredeep sediments on the foreland monocline may simulate downlap geometries once involved and tilted by back-thrusting. The geometry of the Ionian foredeep {{is controlled by the}} dip of the regional monocline, and internally by the variable dip and length of the limb of the external fold, which may be either foreland-verging or hinterland-verging. The generation of a new fold within the foredeep splits the basin into a new foredeep toward the foreland and a thrust-top basin toward the hinterland. The thrust-top basin dimension is primarily controlled by the distance between the two folds and related thrusts at its margins. The foredeep, in its overall history, is composed by a series of concave heterogeneous lenses, progressively displaced and piled up toward the foreland to the east. The formation of each sedimentary lens is controlled by {{the development of a new}} fold and the contemporaneous retreat of the regional monocline which creates new accommodation space. The complex 3 D geometry of the Apennines foredeep mainly results from lateral variations of the latter parameters, as well as variations in sediment supply and eustasy. 1999 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|T 13 A- 2185 Earthquake {{history shows}} that the Sunda {{subduction}} zone of the Indonesian margin produces great earthquakes offshore Sumatra, whereas earthquakes of comparable magnitude are lacking offshore Java and the Lesser Sunda islands. We use morphological structures in multibeam bathymetric data across the forearc to identify {{the extent of the}} seismogenic zone (SZ). The updip limit of the SZ is associated with a distinct slope break at the seawordmost part of the outer arc high off Java and the Lesser Sunda islands. In contrast, the slope break is rather indistinctive off large parts of Sumatra. The inner wedge shows differences along the Indonesian margin. Uniform trench-parallel ridge structures lie off Java and Lesser Sunda islands, whereas non-uniform trench-parallel outer arc high structures consisting of several broad tectonic ridges off Sumatra shape the seaward part of the inner <b>wedge.</b> The landward <b>termination</b> of the inner wedge ridge structure and a shallow upper plate mantle at a depth range of 15 - 25 km at Java and the Lesser Sunda islands coincide with the downdip limit of the seismogenic zone. In contrast the outer arc ridges off Sumatra are wider and partly elevated above sea level forming the forearc islands. Here, the downdip limit of the seismogenic zone is situated at depths of 30 - 40 km, which coincides predominantly with a deeper upper plate mantle. Sunda Strait marks a transition zone between the Sumatra and Java margins. We find the differences along the Sunda margin, especially the wider extent of the seismogenic zone off Sumatra, producing larger earthquakes, to result from the interaction of different age and subduction direction of the oceanic plate. We attribute a major role to the sediment income and continental/island arc upper plate nature of Sumatra/Java influencing the composition and deformation style along the forearc and subduction fault. Off Sumatra the SZ is up to more than twice as wide as off Java and the Sunda islands, enlarging the unstable regime off Sumatra and thus the risk of sudden stress release in a great earthquake...|$|R
40|$|The 26 December 2004 Mw 9. 3 Sumatra to Andaman Islands {{subduction}} zone earthquake {{was the second}} largest earthquake recorded. The tsunami generated by the earthquake caused the loss of ~ 300, 000 lives and devastation of many Indian Ocean coastal communities. The Royal Navy's HMS Scott conducted a multibeam bathymetric survey over the rupture zone during January and February 2005. An area of ~ 40000 km 2 was surveyed during the three week expedition using a 12 kHz, 361 beam hull-mounted Sass IV sonar. This study {{is the first time}} a high resolution deep-water seafloor survey has been carried out so soon after a major plate-boundary {{subduction zone}} earthquake. Existing geophysical data in the earthquake rupture zone are rare and therefore the general subduction zone structure is poorly known. Data were collected along 400 km of the southern and intial part of the rupture zone offshore Sumatra, including the plate boundary and lower accretionary <b>wedge,</b> the southern <b>termination</b> of the earthquake rupture which represents a probable major segment boundary, and parts of the forearc basin and outer arc high system. Initial results reveal the geomorphology of the seafloor and clues to the tectonic and sedimentary processes controlling this morphology during periods of thousands to millions of years of plate convergence. The gradient of the seafloor from the plate boundary (deformation front) where the two plates collide across the accretionary wedge folds is very steep â€“ rising ~ 4000 m over a distance of about 20 km in places. These steep slopes and continuing uplift due to collision augmented by earthquake shaking leads to extensive slope failure and submarine landsliding. The seafloor of the accretionary wedge folded ridges is therefore heavily eroded in places. At the deformation front, a few coherent landslides produce angular blocks which have slid onto the undeformed Indian plate. The youngest of these features has angular coherent blocks and a steep landslide headwall scarp. Sediment from these landslides and slumps is transported into neighbouring basins by short canyon and channel systems. No evidence was found of recent landslides large enough to contribute significantly to the tsunami generated in 2004. Fold ridges of the accretionary wedge are easily identified in the multibeam images. The youngest of these fold ridges at the deformation front where the plates meet are relatively uneroded and only a few hundred metres high. These ridges will have formed over thousands of years. The quality of the data allows small tectonic features to be identified at the base of these ridges. Some of these features may be formed by fault movement during earthquakes such as the event of 2004. The southern part of the HMS Scott survey overlaps with the rupture zone of the Mw 8. 7 earthquake that occurred on March 28 2005, thus presenting the potential for "before" and "after" surveys to better understand how some of these structures may form and be modified during major plate boundary events...|$|R
