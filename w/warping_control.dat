5000|$|Several of the {{reproduction}} planes {{built for the}} film Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines used the wing <b>warping</b> <b>control</b> systems of the original aircraft - with mixed results. The wing warping of the Avro Triplane proved surprisingly successful, whereas on {{the reproduction}} Antoinette, with its very flexible wing, wing warping offered little effective lateral control. Since the original Antoinette-style ailerons would have probably been even less effective, unobtrusive [...] "modern" [...] ailerons were inserted - even with these, lateral control remained very poor.|$|E
50|$|In August 1912 he was {{the pilot}} of the Avro G cabin biplane which had been entered in the British Military Aeroplane Competition taking place at Larkhill Aerodrome on Salisbury Plain.On the morning of August 25 he had carried out a three-hour {{endurance}} trial, accompanied by Lieut. Le Breton, R.F.C., and was approaching the aerodrome in order to land. When flying upwind an altitude of about 650 ft, Parke entered a spiral gliding approach and closed the throttle without switching the engine off. Having turned though a half circle and now more or less flying into wind, Parke thought the aircraft was too nose-up and also insufficiently banked for the turn he was making. He therefore applied up elevator and possibly applied the wing <b>warping</b> <b>control,</b> and at once the aircraft entered a spin.|$|E

50|$|Bonas Machine Company Ltd. {{launched}} {{the first successful}} electronic Jacquard at ITMA, Milan in 1983. Although the machines were initially small, modern technology has allowed Jacquard machine capacity to increase significantly, and single end <b>warp</b> <b>control</b> can extend to more than 10,000 warp ends. This avoids the need for repeats and symmetrical designs and allows almost infinite versatility. The computer-controlled machines significantly reduce the down time associated with changing punched paper designs, thus allowing smaller batch sizes. However, electronic Jacquards are costly {{and may not be}} required in a factory weaving large batch sizes, and smaller designs. The larger machines allowing single end <b>warp</b> <b>control</b> are very expensive, and can only be justified where great versatility is required, or very specialized design requirements need to be met. For example, they are an ideal tool to increase the ability and stretch the versatility of the niche linen Jacquard weavers who remain active in Europe and the West, while most of the large batch commodity weaving has moved to low cost areas.|$|R
50|$|The Star Monoplane had an {{uncovered}} triangular section fuselage of wire-braced ash, {{with the}} wings {{attached to the}} upper longerons and the pilot seated behind {{the trailing edge of}} the wing. The fuselage divided into two sections aft of the cockpit for ease of transportation. The parallel-chord wings had rounded ends and wing <b>warping</b> <b>control,</b> the wires leading to a single king-post above the wing and {{to the ends of the}} undercarriage struts, which bore twin skids, carrying two wheels on a sprung axle. The tail surfaces consisted of a cruciform arrangement of four elongated triangular surfaces starting halfway down the fuselage, ending in raked ends bearing the outer pivots of the moving surfaces, each of which was an elongated diamond shape resembling a Malay kite. These could be used conventionally as rudders and elevators or alternatively operated as linked opposing pairs, so that their operation would cause the aircraft to roll to one side or the other. It was powered by a 30 hp (22 kW) Star engine driving a 6 ft 8 in (2 m) Clarke propeller.|$|E

The deformations {{are represented by}} {{the features of the}} mesh, which are within the bounding volumes and consequently the updating time for the BVH is reduced. The algorithm compares the minimum bounded geometry, the 1 -ring, with the other spheres of the hierarchy in order to cull away bounding volumes (BV) that are far apart.

40|$|Parallel {{computing}} on {{a network}} of workstations can saturate the communication network, leading to excessive message delays and consequently poor application performance. We examine empirically the consequences of integrating a flow <b>control</b> protocol, called <b>Warp</b> <b>control</b> [Par 93], into Mermera, a software shared memory system that supports parallel computing on distributed systems [HS 93]. For an asynchronous iterative program that solves a system of linear equations, our measurements show that Warp succeeds in stabilizing the network's behavior even under high levels of contention. As a result, the application achieves a higher effective communication throughput, and a reduced completion time. In some cases, however, <b>Warp</b> <b>control</b> does not achieve the performance attainable by fixed size buffering when using a statically optimal buffer size. Our use of Warp to regulate the allocation of network bandwidth emphasizes the possibility for integrating it with the allocation of other resources, such as CPU cycles and disk bandwidth, so as to optimize overall system throughput, and enable fully-shared execution of parallel programs.

40|$|Asynchronous {{parallel}} computing {{can result in}} high message generation rates, thus triggering network congestion. This paper investigates the network congestion problem that can result from asynchronous parallel programs' high message generation rates. First, we characterize the communication requirements of a large class of supercomputing applications falling {{under the category of}} fixed-point problems amenable to solution by parallel iterative methods. In particular, we concentrate on asynchronous iterative algorithms whose communication/computation ratio is especially high resulting in degraded effective throughput if communication is not managed properly. Second, we show the effects of network contention and asynchrony on application performance in a local-area network environment and investigate methods of solution. Our approach is based on a congestion <b>control</b> algorithm called <b>Warp</b> <b>Control</b> whose adaptive properties are exploited to yield significant performance enhancements when ne [...] ...|$|R
50|$|A factory {{must choose}} looms and {{shedding}} mechanisms to suit its commercial requirements. As a rule the more <b>warp</b> <b>control</b> required {{the greater the}} expense. So it is not economical to purchase Jacquard machines if one can make do with a dobby mechanism. As well as the capital expense, the Jacquard machines are more costly to maintain, as they are complex and require higher skilled personnel; an expensive design system is required to prepare the designs for the loom, and possibly a card-cutting machine. Weaving is more costly since Jacquard mechanisms {{are more likely to}} produce faults than dobby or cam shedding. Also, the looms will not run as quickly and down-time will increase because it takes time to change the continuous chain of cards when a design changes. For these reasons it is best to weave larger batches with mechanical Jacquards.|$|R

40|$|What motivates {{an artist}} to create images using textile media? What weaving {{techniques}} are suitable for image making? Weavers through the ages have taken colored weft threads in hand and inserted them into the warp, row-by-row, building shape upon shape in the powerful and nuanced, yet structurally simple, technique of weft-faced tapestry. With {{the invention of the}} jacquard loom, the kind of complex image making that was previously only common in tapestry weaving became mechanized, and available on a commercial level that involved faster production rates, lower costs and the creation of multiples. In recent years, the innovations in, and wider availability of jacquard type device looms have made sophisticated <b>warp</b> <b>controlled</b> technology available, and attractive, to artist/weavers. This paper will explore some of the issues surrounding the choices made by artists as they create their work either in traditional weftfaced tapestry or through loom-controlled methods, particularly the jacquard loom. The research for the paper will include facilitating conversations among weavers who use different woven techniques to create images in textiles, artists such as: Bhakti Ziek; Alice Schlein; Bethanne Knudson; Jennifer Sargent; Sigrid Piroch; Kaija Rautiainen; and Christine Spangler. Their artwork and perspectives will be featured in the paper, along with the author’s insights...|$|R

50|$|In July 1899 Wilbur put wing warping to {{the test}} by {{building}} and flying a biplane kite with a five-foot (1.5m) wingspan.

40|$|This thesis proposes {{using an}} {{integrated}} hardware-software solution for improving Single-Instruction Multiple-Thread branching efficiency. Unlike current SIMT hardware branching architectures, this hardware-software solution allows programmers {{the ability to}} fine tune branching behavior for their application or allow the compiler to implement a generic software solution. To support {{a wide range of}} SIMT applications with different control flow properties, three branching methods are implemented in hardware with configurable software instructions. The three branching methods are the contemporary Immediate Post-Dominator Re-convergence that is currently implemented in SIMT processors, a proposed Hyper-threaded SIMT processor for maintaining statically allocated thread warps and a proposed Dynamic Micro-Kernels that modified thread warps during run-time execution. Each of the implemented branching methods have their strengths and weaknesses and result in different performance improvements depending on the application. SIMT hyper-threading turns a single SIMT processor core into multiple virtual processors. These virtual processors run divergent control flow paths in parallel with threads from the same <b>warp.</b> <b>Controlling</b> how the virtual processor cores are created is done using a per-warp stack that is managed through software instructions. Dynamic Micro-Kernels create new threads at run-time to execute divergent control flow paths instead of using branching instructions. A spawn instruction is used to create threads at run-time and once created are placed into new warps with similar threads following the same control flow path. This thesis 2 ̆ 7 s integrated hardware-software branching architectures are evaluated using multiple realistic benchmarks with varying control flow divergence. Synthetic benchmarks are also used for evaluation and are designed to test specific branching conditions and isolate common branching behaviors. Each of the hardware implemented branching solutions are tested in isolation using different software algorithms. Results show improved performance for divergent applications and using different software algorithms will affect performance...|$|R
