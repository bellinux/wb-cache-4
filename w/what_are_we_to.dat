5|$|After {{all that}} has been said and done, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>to</b> make of Lloyd George’s legacy as a war leader? On the home front he {{achieved}} varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. It {{would be hard to}} have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while {{he did not have the}} technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. All things considered, it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although it can be argued that if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lord George's contributions outweighed his mistakes, the margin is too narrow, in my opinion, to include him In the pantheon of Britain's outstanding war leaders.|$|E
2500|$|Dziga Vertov {{believed}} {{his concept of}} Kino-Glaz, or [...] "Cine Eye" [...] in English, [...] would help contemporary [...] "man" [...] evolve from a flawed creature into a higher, more precise form. He compared man unfavorably to machines: [...] "In {{the face of the}} machine we are ashamed of man’s inability to control himself, but <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>to</b> do if we find the unerring ways of electricity more exciting than the disorderly haste of active people [...] " [...] "I am an eye. I am a mechanical eye. I, a machine, I am showing you a world, the likes of which only I can see" [...] Dziga was quoted as saying.|$|E
2500|$|The Pas Cheh Bayed Kard ai Aqwam-e-Sharq (<b>What</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> <b>to</b> do, O Nations of the East?) {{includes}} the poem Musafir (Traveler). Again, Iqbal depicts Rumi {{as a character}} and an exposition of the mysteries of Islamic laws and Sufi perceptions is given. Iqbal laments the dissension and disunity among the Indian Muslims as well as Muslim nations. Musafir is an account of one of Iqbal's journeys to Afghanistan, in which the Pashtun people are counselled to learn the [...] "secret of Islam" [...] and to [...] "build up the self" [...] within themselves. Iqbal's final work was the Armughan-e-Hijaz (The Gift of Hijaz), published posthumously in 1938. The first part contains quatrains in Persian, {{and the second part}} contains some poems and epigrams in Urdu. The Persian quatrains convey the impression that the poet is travelling through the Hijaz in his imagination. Profundity of ideas and intensity of passion are the salient features of these short poems.|$|E
