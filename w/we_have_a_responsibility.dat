[...] He explained his views on regulation and risk in a 2008 New York Times article where he was quoted as saying [...] "The unwillingness of the Federal Reserve and the S.E.C. to require working capital limits only exacerbates the risk-taking environment because the banks are playing the equivalent of no-limit poker." [...] Later in 2008, he testified to the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, stating that [...] "The rapid growth in the use of derivatives has created an opaque market whose outstanding notional value is measured in the hundreds of trillions of dollars. As a result, there is great concern about the systemic effects of the failure of any one financial institution." ...|$|E

I was no fly fishing expert, but I saw how much pleasure it gave them to release these little fish. And I thought bass tournament guys just might enjoy it even more. Bass boats did not have livewells then and {{it was tough to}} handle the fish properly, but I’m proud that our anglers did their very best with coolers, stringers and nets. Biologists told me that fishing tournaments couldn’t harm the bass resource, but I felt that as the popularity of competitive fishing grew we were facing a serious public relations problem. We donated fish to charity, but the sight of dead bass at every event was not a good image for fishing. I felt <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>responsibility</b> to do the right thing.
