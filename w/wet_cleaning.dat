By soaking the leather in water, additional issues may arise such as distortion, discoloration, hardening, movement of salts and tannins, and tidemarks. Using cotton swabs with common solutions is a safe and regular practice in cleaning leather. Common solutions used are mixtures of water with ammonia, white spirit, alcohol or detergents.

Experiments using trisiloxanes and comparison with 3 different ethylene glycol monododecyl ethers (C 12 E 4, C 12 E 5, and C 12 E 6) surfactants were performed to understand the influence of Marangoni force as the driving force for the spreading.

50|$|<b>Wet</b> <b>cleaning</b> is {{the process}} of further removal of dirt, grime and residue {{from the surface of the}} object that is not {{successfully}} removed by dry cleaning. Testing of various solvents should be done prior to <b>wet</b> <b>cleaning</b> the surface of the object in order to prevent possible damage to or removal of the original lacquer surface. Aqueous solvents with different PH levels will have varying levels of success in the removal of dirt and grime from the surface of the lacquer, and have various levels of risk of damaging the surface. This also depends on the condition of the object prior to cleaning. Nonpolar solvents are less likely to damage surfaces that have been photodegradad.|$|E

An appropriate round of fumigation in an autoclave {{is used to}} remove pests and sterilize the object. Dry and <b>wet</b> <b>cleaning</b> techniques can both be used effectively on parchment objects. Mechanical cleaning using erasers and other abrasive tools is used to remove mildew and dirt. Surface cleaning of parchment is typically completed using white vinyl erasers (solid and grated) and confined to areas where no media is present.
