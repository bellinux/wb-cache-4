"Still," [...] said Mr. Hall, [...] "although <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> {{apply the}} simple term sailing to a steamer, I hardly {{think that a}} trip in a steamer on a regular and {{established}} route would be called, according to the ordinary and established use of language, taking a sail. Was that the promise--that one party would go with the other to take a sail on the lake?" ...|$|E

But there are some creatures with which <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not wish to meet, and {{unfortunately}} these are not uncommon. I mean the alligators and the great serpents. The natives fear the alligators much, for their weapons are of no avail against them, and they would never venture to attack a great snake." ...|$|E

6000|$|Captain Harville smiled, {{as much as}} to say, [...] "Do {{you claim}} that for your sex?" [...] and she {{answered}} the question, smiling also, [...] "Yes. <b>We</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not forget {{you as soon as}} you forget us. It is, perhaps, our fate rather than our merit. We cannot help ourselves. We live at home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us. You are forced on exertion. You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately, and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions." ...|$|E
60|$|Thus {{it is our}} {{particular}} thoughts and feelings that have primitive certainty. And this applies to dreams and hallucinations {{as well as to}} normal perceptions: when we dream or see a ghost, <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> have the sensations we think we have, but for various reasons it is held that no physical object corresponds to these sensations. Thus the certainty of our knowledge of our own experiences {{does not have to be}} limited in any way to allow for exceptional cases. Here, therefore, we have, for what it is worth, a solid basis from which to begin our pursuit of knowledge.|$|E
6000|$|That Mr. Ridgeway adopts Helbig's theory--the poet says [...] "bronze," [...] by a {{survival}} of the diction of the bronze age, when he means iron--I infer from the following passage: [...] "Chalkos is the name for the older metal, of which cutting weapons were made, and it thus lingered in many phrases of the Epic dialect; 'to smite with the chalkos' was equivalent to our phrase 'to smite with the steel.'" [...] [Footnote: Early Age of Greece, i. 295.] But <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> smite with the steel, while the question is, [...] "DID Homer's men smite with the iron?" [...] Homer says not; he does not merely use [...] "an epic phrase" [...] "to smite with the CHALKOS," [...] but he carefully describes swords, spears, and usually arrow-heads as being of bronze (CHALKOS), while axes, adzes, and knives are frequently described by him as of iron.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ancient history," [...] murmured Tom Rover, dryly. But then, of {{a sudden}} his eyes began to twinkle. [...] "No use talking, though, <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> have some good times in those days, didn't we?" [...] he continued. [...] "Do you {{remember}} how we {{got the best of}} old Josiah Crabtree?" ...|$|R
60|$|I cannot {{honestly}} say we ever wished her back; though <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> miss her--missed many a joke at her oddities, many a laugh at her cornery ways. It takes all sorts, {{as the saying}} goes, to make a world. Possibly enough if only we perfect folk were left in it we would find it uncomfortably monotonous.|$|R
60|$|An {{important}} fact {{in domestic}} economy was discovered {{about this time}} by Euphemia and myself. Perhaps we were {{not the first to}} discover it, but <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> find it out,--and this fact was, that housekeeping costs money. At the end of every week we counted up our expenditures--it was no trouble at all to count up our receipts--and every week the result was more unsatisfactory.|$|R
6000|$|This is {{particularly}} humiliating, because {{it happens to}} be true. <b>We</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> trudge, and are therefore properly, though rather unceremoniously, called trudgers, or [...] "trodgers." [...] But we sink to a lower depth yet, a little further on. We are viewed as objects for pity. It is a fine evening; we stop and lean against a bank by the roadside to look at the sunset. An old woman comes tottering by on high pattens, very comfortably and nicely clad. She sees our knapsacks, and instantly stops in front of us, and begins to moan lamentably. Not understanding at first what this means, we ask respectfully if she feels at all ill? [...] "Ah, poor fellows! poor fellows!" [...] she sighs in answer, [...] "obliged to carry all your baggage on your own backs!--very hard! poor lads! very hard, indeed!" [...] And the good old soul goes away groaning over our evil plight, and mumbling something which sounds very like an assurance that she has got no money to give us.|$|E
60|$|His {{religion}} {{must always}} be a subject of much doubt, and probably of doubt which he himself could hardly have cleared up. Unquestionably {{there was a time}} in his life when he was sincerely enthusiastic, and when his natural temper, slightly subject to hypochondria, was strongly agitated by the same fanaticism which influenced so many persons of the time. On the other hand, there were periods during his political career, when <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> him no injustice in charging him with a hypocritical affectation. We shall probably judge him, and others of the same age, most truly, if we suppose that their religious professions were partly influential in their own breasts, partly assumed in compliance with their own interest. And so ingenious is the human heart in deceiving itself as well as others, that it is probable neither Cromwell himself, nor those making similar pretensions to distinguished piety, could exactly have fixed the point at which their enthusiasm terminated and their hypocrisy commenced; or rather, it was a point not fixed in itself, but fluctuating with the state of health, of good or bad fortune, of high or low spirits, affecting the individual at the period.|$|E
60|$|I {{ought not}} to omit {{mentioning}} {{that he has been}} told in France that he personally resembles the Emperor, and I suspect he is trying to heighten the resemblance by training his mustache on the pattern of that which adorns the imperial upper lip. He is a genuine American character, though modified by a good deal of travel; a very intelligent man, full of various ability, with eyes all over him for any object of interest,--a little of the bore, sometimes,--quick to appreciate character, with a good deal of tact, gentlemanly in his manners, but yet lacking a deep and delicate refinement. Not but that Americans are as capable of this last quality as other people are; but what with the circumstances amid which we grow up, and the peculiar activity of our minds, <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> often miss it. By the by, he advanced a singular proposition the other evening, namely, that the English people do not so well understand comfort, or attain it so perfectly in their domestic arrangements, as we do. I thought he hardly supported this opinion so satisfactorily as some of his other new ideas.|$|E

6000|$|... "Before I {{entered the}} Cabinet," [...] Mr. Hebblethwaite continued, [...] "our {{relations}} with Foreign Powers {{were just the}} myth {{to me that they}} are to most people who read the Morning Post one day and the Daily Mail the next. However, I made the best part of half a million in business through knowing the top and the bottom and every corner of my job, and I started in to do the same when I began to have a share in the government of the country. The entente with France is all right in its way, but I {{came to the conclusion that}} the greatest and broadest stroke of diplomacy possible to Englishmen to-day was to cultivate more benevolent and more confidential relations with Germany. That same feeling has been spreading through the Cabinet during the last two years. I am ready to take my share of the blame or praise, whichever in the future shall be allotted to the inspirer of that idea. It is our hope that when the present Government goes out of office, one of its chief claims to public approval and to historical praise will be the improvement of our relations with Germany. <b>We</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not wish to disturb the growing confidence which exists between the two countries by any maladroit or unnecessary investigations. We believe, in short, that Germany's attitude towards us is friendly, and we intend to treat her in the same spirit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 141 I must, however, remark, {{that this}} example, {{which seems to}} militate [...] against the {{assertion}} we made of the comparative inapplicability of [...] the Method of Difference to cases of pure observation, is really one [...] of those exceptions which, according to a proverbial expression, [...] prove the general rule. For in this case, in which Nature, in her [...] experiment, seems to have imitated the type of the experiments made [...] by man, she has only succeeded in producing the likeness of man’s [...] most imperfect experiments; namely, those in which, though he [...] succeeds in producing the phenomenon, he does so by employing [...] complex means, which he is unable perfectly to analyze, and can [...] form, therefore, no sufficient judgment what portion of the effects [...] may be due, not to the supposed cause, but to some unknown agency of [...] {{the means by which}} that cause was produced. In the natural [...] experiment which we are speaking of, the means used was the clearing [...] off a canopy of clouds; and <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not know sufficiently in [...] what this process consists, or on what it depends, to be certain a [...] priori that it might not operate upon the deposition of dew [...] independently of any thermometric effect at the earth’s surface. [...] Even, therefore, in a case so favorable as this to Nature’s [...] experimental talents, her experiment is of little value except in [...] corroboration of a conclusion already attained through other means.|$|E
60|$|Again, <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> {{not expect}} to see the Royal Society inquiring into second sight, or clairvoyance, or thought transference. When the Royal Society was first founded several of its members, Pepys, F.R.S.; Mr. Robert Boyle, F.R.S.; the Rev. Joseph Glanvill, F.R.S., went into these things a good deal. But, in spite of their title, they were only amateurs. They had no {{professional}} dignity to keep up. They were well aware that they, unlike the late Mr. Faraday, did not know, by inspiration or by common-sense, the limits of the possible. They tried all things, it was such a superstitious age. Now men of science, or the majority of them, for there are some exceptions, know what is, and what is not possible. They know that germs of life may possibly come down on meteorites from somewhere else, and they produced an argument for the existence of a bathybius. But they also know that a man is not a bird to be in two places at once, like Pythagoras, and that nobody can see through a stone wall. These, and similar allegations, they reckon impossible, and, if the facts happen, so much the worse for the facts. They can only be due to imposture or mal-observation, and there is an end of the matter. This is the view of official science. Unluckily, not many years ago, official science was equally certain that the ordinary phenomena of hypnotism were based on imposture and on mal- observation. These phenomena, too, were tabooed. But so many people could testify to them, and they could be so easily explained by the suggestive force of suggestion, that they were reluctantly admitted within the sacred citadel. Many people, sane, not superstitious, healthy, and even renowned as scientific specialists, attest the existence of the still rarer phenomena which are said, in certain cases, to accompany the now more familiar incidents of hypnotism. But these phenomena have never yet been explained by any theory which science recognises, as she does recognise that suggestion is suggestive. Therefore these rarer phenomena manifestly do not exist, and cannot be the subject of legitimate inquiry.|$|E

After a few long nights with the whole team playing the game over and over again, we reached a point where we built a good final candidate. Then it was sent to the duplicators! ...|$|R
60|$|However, he did startle {{the poor}} old parish clergyman effectually by calling {{on him to}} publish the banns of {{marriage}} between Dermot Edward St. Glear Tracy and Lucy Percy Alison, both residing in this parish. He evidently thought we were in hiding from someone who knew of some just cause or impediment; but whereas <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> full justice to our ages twenty-eight and twenty-six, he could only try to examine us individually very politely, but betraying how uncomfortable he was.|$|R
60|$|In judging of {{the success}} or want of success of any {{political}} institutions or of any form of government, we should be guided, I think, by the general results, and not by any abstract rules as to the right or wrong of those institutions or of that form. It might be easy for a German lawyer to show that our system of trial by jury {{is open to the}} gravest objections, and that it sins against common sense. But if that system gives us substantial justice, and protects us from the tyranny of men in office, the German will not succeed in making us believe that it is a bad system. When looking into the matter of the schools at Boston, I observed to one of the committee of management that the statements with which I was supplied, though they told me how many of the children went to school, did not tell me how long they remained at school. The gentleman replied that that information was to be obtained from the result of the schooling of the population generally. Every boy and girl around him could read and write, and could enjoy reading and writing. There was therefore evidence to show that they remained at school sufficiently long for the required purposes. It was fair that I should judge of the system from the results. Here, in England, we generally object to much that the Americans have adopted into their form of government, and think that many of their political theories are wrong. We do not like universal suffrage. We do not like a periodical change in the first magistrate; and we like quite as little a periodical permanence in the political officers immediately under the chief magistrate; we are, in short, wedded to our own forms, and therefore opposed by judgment to forms differing from our own. But I think we all acknowledge that the United States, burdened as they are with these political evils--as we think them--have grown in strength and material prosperity with a celerity of growth hitherto unknown among nations. We may dislike Americans personally, we may find ourselves uncomfortable when there, and unable to sympathize with them when away. We may believe them to be ambitious, unjust, self-idolatrous, or irreligious; but unless we throw our judgment altogether overboard, we cannot believe them to be a weak people, a poor people, a people with low spirits or with idle hands. Now to what is it that the government of a country should chiefly look? What special advantages do we expect from our own government? Is it not that we should be safe at home and respected abroad--that laws should be maintained, but that they should be so maintained that they should not be oppressive? There are, doubtless, countries in which the government professes to do much more than this for its people--countries in which the government is paternal; in which it regulates the religion of the people, and professes to enforce on all the national children respect for the governors, teachers, spiritual pastors, and masters. But that is not our idea of a government. That is not what we desire to see established among ourselves or established among others. Safety from foreign foes, respect from foreign foes and friends, security under the law and security from the law, this is what we expect from our government; and if I add to this that we expect to have these good things provided at a fairly moderate cost, I think I have exhausted the list of our requirements. I hardly think that we even yet expect the government to take the first steps in the rudimentary education of the people. <b>We</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not expect it to make the people religious, or to keep them honest.|$|E
6000|$|What {{is worse}} than want of depth and {{fineness}} of intonation in a period, is all gross excess of colour, because excess of colour is connected with graver faults {{in the region of}} the intellectual conscience. Macaulay is a constant sinner in this respect. The wine of truth is in his cup a brandied draught, a hundred degrees above proof, and he too often replenishes the lamp of knowledge with naphtha instead of fine oil. It is not that he has a spontaneous passion for exuberant decoration, which he would have shared with more than one of the greatest names in literature. On the contrary, we feel that the exaggerated words and dashing sentences are the fruit of deliberate travail, and the petulance or the irony of his speech is mostly due to a driving predilection for strong effects. His memory, his directness, his aptitude for forcing things into firm outline, and giving them a sharply defined edge,--these and other singular talents of his all lent themselves to this intrepid and indefatigable pursuit of effect. And the most disagreeable feature is that Macaulay was so often content with an effect of an essentially vulgar kind, offensive to taste, discordant to the fastidious ear, and worst of all, at enmity with the whole spirit of truth. By vulgar <b>we</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>do</b> not mean homely, which marks a wholly different quality. No writer can be more homely than Mr. Carlyle, alike in his choice of particulars to dwell upon, and in the terms or images in which he describes or illustrates them, but there is also no writer further removed from vulgarity. Nor do we mean that Macaulay too copiously enriches the tongue with infusion from any Doric dialect. For such raciness he had little taste. What we find in him is that quality which the French call brutal. The description, for instance, in the essay on Hallam, of the licence of the Restoration, seems to us a coarse and vulgar picture, whose painter took the most garish colours he could find on his palette, and then laid them on in untempered crudity. And who is not sensible of the vulgarity and coarseness of the account of Boswell? 'If he had not been a great fool he would not have been a great writer ... he was a dunce, a parasite, and a coxcomb,' and so forth, in which the shallowness of the analysis of Boswell's character matches the puerile rudeness of the terms. Here again, is a sentence about Montesquieu. 'The English at that time,' Macaulay says of the middle of the eighteenth century, 'considered a Frenchman who talked about constitutional checks and fundamental laws as a prodigy not less astonishing than the learned pig or musical infant.' And he then goes on to describe the author {{of one of the most}} important books that ever were written, as 'specious but shallow, studious of effect, indifferent to truth--the lively President,' and so forth, stirring in any reader who happens to know Montesquieu's influence, a singular amazement. We are not concerned with the judgment upon Montesquieu, nor with the truth as to contemporary English opinion about him, but a writer who devises an antithesis to such a man as Montesquieu in learned pigs and musical infants, deliberately condescends not merely to triviality or levity, but to flat vulgarity of thought, to something of mean and ignoble association. Though one of the most common, this is not Macaulay's only sin in the same unfortunate direction. He too frequently resorts to vulgar gaudiness. For example, there is in one place a certain description of an alleged practice of Addison's. Swift had said of Esther Johnson that 'whether from easiness in general, or from her indifference to persons, or from her despair of mending them, or from the same practice which she most liked in Mr. Addison, I cannot determine; but when she saw any of the company very warm in a wrong opinion, she was more inclined to confirm them in it than to oppose them. It prevented noise, she said, and saved time.'[2] Let us behold what a picture Macaulay draws on the strength of this passage. 'If his first attempts to set a presuming dunce right were ill-received,' Macaulay says of Addison, 'he changed his tone, [...] "assented with civil leer," [...] and lured the flattered coxcomb deeper and deeper into absurdity.' To compare this transformation of the simplicity of the original into the grotesque heat and overcharged violence of the copy, is to see the homely maiden of a country village transformed into the painted flaunter of the city.|$|E
