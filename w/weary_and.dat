5|$|According to the {{contemporary}} historian Yahya of Antioch, the conspirators of 1022 were released by Constantine VIII after Basil's death in 1025, but Xiphias remained in exile until 1028, when the new emperor, Romanos III, released him. Xiphias, however, was by now too old and <b>weary,</b> <b>and</b> soon retired to the Stoudios Monastery. Nothing further is known of him.|$|E
5|$|The Romney Literary Society's library {{suffered}} significant losses {{during the}} war, {{and by the}} war's end in 1865, only about 400 volumes of its once large 3,000-volume library could be located.

5|$|After leaving Khwarizm, Qutayba {{initially}} turned towards Merv, for {{his army}} had grown <b>weary</b> <b>and</b> demanded {{an end to}} the campaign. During the march, however, Qutayba suddenly turned the army around towards Samarkand. The Sogdians had disbanded most of their forces, and the Arabs, reinforced with levies from Bukhara and Khwarizm, were able to brush aside the local resistance and advance straight to the city itself and lay siege to it. Ghurak and the inhabitants of the city resisted the Arabs with determination, and called upon the rulers of Shash and the Ferghana Valley for aid. The ruler of Shash indeed sent a strong army to aid them, but it was ambushed and destroyed by the Arabs. The news of this arrived at the time where the Arab siege weapons had effected a breach in the city walls, forcing Ghurak to sue for peace. Qutayba initially granted surprisingly lenient terms: the payment of an annual tribute and the provision of an auxiliary corps as with Bukhara and Khwarizm, as well as the construction of a mosque inside the city and the celebration of prayers there by the Arab army. Once inside the city however, Qutayba proceeded to occupy and garrison it. One of his brothers (accounts differ between Abd al-Rahman and Abdallah) was left as governor, and orders were given prohibiting any non-Muslim access to the city citadel. Ghurak and his retinue left the city and founded a new town, Farankath, further to the north. This treachery enabled Qutayba to bring most of Transoxiana under his (albeit tentative) control, but it also considerably tarnished his prestige among the Sogdians.|$|E

25|$|All {{throughout}} the late 17th century, the Mughal dynasty had grown <b>weary</b> <b>and</b> {{weak in the}} regions of the Sindhu territory or Sindh and the governor Yar Muhammad Khan Kalhora became the de facto, virtual ruler of Sindh around 1701 CE. Muhammad Khan Kalhora belonged to the most affluent tribe in the region namely the Kalhora کلہوڑا.|$|E

25|$|The {{plan was}} to make a three-day dash to Johannesburg before the Boer commandos could mobilise, and once there, trigger an {{uprising}} by the primarily British expatriate workers (uitlanders) organised by the Reform Committee. However, the Transvaal authorities had advance warning of the Jameson Raid and tracked it from the moment it crossed the border. Four days later, the <b>weary</b> <b>and</b> dispirited column was surrounded near Krugersdorp within sight of Johannesburg. After a brief skirmish in which the column lost 65 killed and wounded—while the Boers lost but one man—Jameson's men surrendered and were arrested by the Boers.|$|E
25|$|Confederate cavalry forces under Stuart {{for this}} {{operation}} {{consisted of the}} three brigades he had taken on his ride around the Union Army (commanded by Brig. Gen. Wade Hampton, Brig. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee and Col. John Chambliss) and the brigade of Col. Albert G. Jenkins (under the command of Col. Milton J. Ferguson following Jenkins' wounding on July 2). Although these four brigades should have amounted to approximately 5,000 men, {{it is likely that}} only 3,430 men and 13 guns saw action that day. And following their nine-day ride around Maryland and Pennsylvania, they and their horses were <b>weary</b> <b>and</b> not in prime condition for battle.|$|E

25|$|With {{the signing}} of the Treaty of Berwick, the Second War of Scottish Independence was {{effectively}} over. Even before {{the signing of}} the treaty, in January 1356, Edward Balliol — <b>weary</b> <b>and</b> ill — had relinquished his claim in the kingdom of Scotland to Edward III in exchange for an annuity of £2000. He retired to live {{the rest of his life}} in the area of Yorkshire. David II returned to Scotland, to try again to deal with the rivalries of his lords as well as now among his ladies, as his wife Joan evidently objected to the English mistress he had taken during his 11 years in captivity. The treaty did impose a financial hardship on Scotland, but David II stopped paying after only 20,000 merks of the debt had been met, following which renegotiation led ultimately to a reduction in the debt and a 14-year truce.|$|E
25|$|The {{passenger}} pigeon was hunted in Northern Michigan {{as a source}} of food, but by the 1870s, a combination of increased population and economic scarcity led to over-hunting and eventual extinction. The massive flocks of {{passenger pigeon}}s stopped darkening the skies of Northern Michigan, especially after the last large scale nestings and subsequent slaughters of millions of birds in 1874 and 1878. By this time, large nestings only took place in the north, around the Great Lakes. The last large nesting was in Petoskey, Michigan, in 1878 (following one in Pennsylvania a few days earlier), where 50,000 birds were killed each day for nearly five months. The surviving adults attempted a second nesting at new sites, but were killed by professional hunters before they had a chance to raise any young. Scattered nestings were reported into the 1880s, but the birds were now <b>weary,</b> <b>and</b> commonly abandoned their nests if persecuted.|$|E
25|$|Gabriel travels {{back to the}} city, {{and finds}} the brothel where Amitiel works. He also {{encounters}} Asmodeus, the Fallen who runs the brothel. Gabriel rescues Amitiel and kills the Fallen Balan who tries to rape her. He then heals her of the drugs she has been taking to dull the pain of her job. As Gabriel's use of power makes his presence known in Purgatory, the Fallen grow <b>weary</b> <b>and</b> impatient of waiting. Amitiel takes Gabriel to the soup kitchen where the Archangel Ithuriel hides. Initially angry at Ithuriel for abandoning his mission of seeking out and destroying the Fallen, Gabriel eventually shows him compassion and understanding. Ithuriel takes Gabriel to the abandoned tunnels beneath the soup kitchen where the gravely wounded Raphael dwells. Gabriel heals Raphael, expending much of his strength. After rebuking Gabriel, Raphael explains that Sammael draws his immense power from the other Fallen. Gabriel proposes {{to take out the}} remaining Fallen one by one, before finally facing Sammael. Raphael is unconvinced, as Sammael has already killed the stronger angel Michael.|$|E

500|$|In 1864 the war {{was nearing}} its end, but many Hoosiers were war <b>weary</b> <b>and</b> saw {{no end in sight}} as they {{prepared}} for the state's next gubernatorial election. Indiana's constitution prohibited a governor to serve more than four years in any eight-year period, but Morton was elected as Indiana's lieutenant governor in 1860 and had only been completing Lane's term, so he claimed that was eligible to run for governor in the upcoming election. The Democrats were furious and launched a bitter campaign against Morton, who did not do a great deal of campaigning. Instead, he successfully returned about 9,000 active-duty soldiers home on leave to vote in the election, presumably for Morton, [...] "the soldier's friend", and his fellow Republicans.|$|E
500|$|Kooman {{said that}} the massive {{proportions}} of human trafficking often prevent people from dealing with it; he therefore chose to portray a single trafficked victim in the play so that audiences could approach the subject on a more workable level. He hoped that audiences would avoid getting stuck in the statistics of human trafficking and would connect with a personal story. The two questions that propel the story are: [...] "Can [...] convince [...] to risk her life to testify {{for the sake of}} justice?" [...] and [...] "Can he save her from the unthinkable circumstances?" [...] Jason is <b>weary</b> <b>and,</b> although he never falls into self-pity, he comes to hate himself for his inability to save Number 18 from her slavery because he lacks the evidence he requires for his case to be successful in court.|$|E
