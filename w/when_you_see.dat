The jewelry schedule was very complicated, because pieces had to go from Switzerland to Paris, and the shooting schedule was changing constantly. It was really a house of cards. There were a couple of times we got caught, scenes got moved up, and lucky for me, Madonna was able to make available her personal jewelry. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> Wallis spraying the flowers with perfume, her black and white pearl and diamond Bulgari earrings are Madonna's.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} Besson stated The Fifth Element {{was not a}} [...] "big theme movie", although the film's theme was an important one.

Telotte, writing in the book Science Fiction Film, credited the film with exploring the theme of political corruption.|$|E

500|$|UK Anime Network, a British online anime and manga magazine, {{gave the}} {{television}} series a 7 out of 10, summarizing it as [...] "An utter subversion {{of the high}} school romance genre, which is disturbing and unsettling... yet oddly compelling in its own way."

500|$|Killen avouched {{that writing}} the episode's script {{was one of}} the more {{difficult}} processes of creating the series. He and his writing team would often get confused with exchanging and executing ideas for the script; as a result, they created outlines and distinguished them in green and red ink. Slade edited the language to better separate the ideas. [...] "So the things that are initially confusing to us when we are just trying to break story, I think by the time they reach an audience, so much {{attention has been paid to}} how to make it clear where you are that all of the little tricks that we needed sort of go away. And hopefully <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> it on the screen, you are pretty instantly oriented as to which world you are in." ...|$|E
500|$|While Lennon was [...] "evangelical in {{his enthusiasm}} for the Maharishi", {{according}} to his wife, Cynthia, she herself was [...] "a little more sceptical". [...] Cynthia later wrote that she [...] "loved being in India" [...] and had hoped she and Lennon would [...] "rediscover our lost closeness"; to her disappointment, however, Lennon became [...] "increasingly cold and aloof". The Lennons' room contained a [...] "four-poster bed, a dressing table, a couple of chairs and an electric fire". Lennon played guitar, while his wife drew pictures and wrote poetry between their long meditation sessions. After two weeks Lennon asked {{to sleep in a}} separate room, saying he could only meditate when he was alone. Meanwhile, he walked to the local post office every morning to check for Ono's almost daily telegrams. One of these telegrams read: [...] "Look up at the sky and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> a cloud think of me".|$|E
500|$|After the {{election}} {{and the return of}} the National Government, little happened to support Baldwin's optimistic words. In the House of Commons on 2 March 1936, Wilkinson spoke of the [...] "atmosphere of mystery" [...] that surrounded the Jarrow scheme: [...] "Publicly one sees tremendous optimism... but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> people privately {{there is a great deal}} of humming and ha'ing, and they are not quite sure". Meanwhile, the BISF argued that increased steel production should be achieved by expanding capacity in existing facilities, rather than by building new plant. Duncan, in a reversal of his earlier attitude, now opposed the provision of finance for Jarrow which, he felt, might create a precedent that other distressed areas could exploit. The BISF finally succeeded in watering down the scheme to the extent that [...] it became unviable; Salt and his syndicate withdrew, and the scheme was dead, [...] "strangled at birth" [...] according to Wilkinson.|$|E

500|$|Anderson's strong {{performance}} in {{his rookie season}} helped him participate in a three-day tryout for the NBA's Indiana Pacers in June 2008. He expected {{to take part in}} the team's training camp, but a trade involving Jarrett Jack and T. J. Ford led him to never receive the invite. On August 9, 2008, Anderson signed a contract with AEK Larnaca B.C. of the Cyprus Basketball Division 1. He finished the season averaging 17.8 points, 4.0 rebounds, and 4.2 assists, with the second-most assists in the league and the most points. In an interview with SLAM Online, Anderson said, [...] "It was very good competition. It's just like <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> European guys in the NBA. There are a lot of skilled and crafty players, not overly athletic but very skilled." [...] He played against players such as Bradley Buckman while in Cyprus. After the season concluded, Eurobasket.com named Anderson 2nd Team All-Cyprus League.|$|E
500|$|The cover mode was {{designed}} to enhance the stealth aspect {{of the game and}} the third-person perspective was needed to allow players to see the character they were playing. The idea of bringing the game into a total third-person perspective was rejected as the shooting [...] "works better" [...] in first-person view, explained Tilston. Developers decided not to include a jumping function since they felt it goes against the nature of the genre. Botwood pointed out that it can [...] "look damn stupid <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> other players doing it". For this reason, the team implemmented moves such as climbing obstacles or, more specifically, the combat roll, which makes players harder to hit since it breaks the game's auto-aim lock. The transition between first and third-person view with some moves took a lot of work so that they did not become disorientating. A first-person roll was implemented at one time, but it was ultimately dropped.|$|E
500|$|The split-reel comedy, {{approximately}} 1000 {{feet long}} with A Husband's Jealous Wife included, {{was released on}} September 23, 1910. Advertising for the film was a bit mixed {{as to whether or}} not it was a comedy or a drama, stating, [...] "You have no idea as to how marvelously a Thanhouser can twist a story until you see this gripping dra - well, perhaps, it isn't a drama at that - or a comedy even. We hate to tip you off as to WHAT it is. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> the picture, with its totally unlooked-for climax, you'll know why!" [...] Bowers would later term this as more of the slapstick comedy that Edwin Thanhouser said the company would not produce. The film likely had a wide national release, known advertising theatres include Indiana, and Kansas. The film was also shown in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. One theater advertisement may have confused this film with another because it lists this film as a western film.|$|E
