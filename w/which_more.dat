50|$|The {{effect of}} a change in {{production}} creates a multiplied impact because it creates income which further creates consumption. However, the resulting consumption is also an expenditure <b>which</b> thus, generates <b>more</b> income, <b>which</b> creates <b>more</b> consumption.

5|$|By July 1940 the {{situation}} had improved somewhat with uniforms, a modicum of training {{and the arrival of}} hundreds of thousands of rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition from the USA. New weapons were developed that could be produced cheaply without consuming materials that were needed to produce armaments for the regular units. An early example was the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade (a glass bottle filled with highly flammable material of <b>which</b> <b>more</b> than six million were made), and the No. 73 Grenade (an anti-tank grenade resembling a Thermos flask).|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} twentieth century, the U.S. Treasury had mints {{operating}} in New Orleans, Denver, San Francisco, and the main center in Philadelphia, <b>which</b> <b>more</b> than met the demand for minted money. In 1904, the government ceased the minting of the silver dollar, which accounted {{for the bulk of}} the coinage the New Orleans branch had been producing since 1879. In 1909 Treasury officials declined to appropriate funds for the mint's operation, effectively halting subsequent minting activity in New Orleans. In 1911, the New Orleans Mint was formally decommissioned and the machinery was transferred to the main U. S. Mint facility in Philadelphia,.|$|E
5|$|Cancer pagurus {{is heavily}} {{exploited}} commercially throughout its range, {{being the most}} commercially important crab species in Western Europe. The crabs are caught using crab pots (similar to lobster pots) which are placed offshore and baited. The catch of C. pagurus has increased steadily, rising from 26,000tonnes in 1978 to 60,000t in 2007, of <b>which</b> <b>more</b> than 70% was caught around the British Isles. The fishery is widely dispersed around the British and Irish coasts, and C. pagurus {{is thought to be}} overfished across much of this area. Most of the edible crabs caught by the British fleet are exported live for sale in France and Spain.|$|E

Sometimes termed the products of the Chicago school of architecture, these skyscrapers attempted to balance aesthetic concerns with practical commercial design, producing large, square palazzo-styled buildings hosting shops and restaurants on the ground level and containing rentable offices on the upper floors. In contrast, New York's skyscrapers were frequently narrower towers <b>which,</b> <b>more</b> eclectic in style, were often criticized for their lack of elegance. In 1892, Chicago banned the construction of new skyscrapers taller than , leaving the development of taller buildings to New York.|$|E
5|$|I have {{a rather}} more {{favourable}} {{opinion of the}} 'Vestiges' than you appear to have.

It furnishes a subject for every student of nature to attend to; every fact he observes will make either for or against it, and it thus serves both as an incitement to the collection of facts, and an object to which they can be applied when collected.|$|E

5|$|Ten {{years after}} his first tour of England, Hassett was {{included}} in the 1948 team as Bradman's deputy. Hassett was one of three on-tour selectors along with Bradman and Arthur Morris.

As matches often started the day after the previous fixture, Australia employed a rotation policy and Hassett led the tourists in nine of the 34 matches while Bradman was rested. Under Hassett's watch, Australia won seven matches, five of these by an innings, while both draws were rain-affected fixtures in <b>which</b> <b>more</b> than half the playing time was lost.|$|E
