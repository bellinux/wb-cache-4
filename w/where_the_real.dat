5|$|Described as a {{large and}} {{physically}} imposing character {{with a reputation for}} womanising, Le Gris was a liege man (feudal retainer) of Count Pierre d'Alençon and a favourite at his court, governing a large swathe of his liege lord's territory in addition to his own ancestral holdings. Le Gris' insistence on defending his case by chivalric trial by combat rather than opting for the safer church trial (to which as a cleric in minor orders he was entitled) attracted widespread support for his cause amongst the French nobility, and controversy continues to this day as to <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> guilt lies in the case.|$|E
5|$|Following Christiane's funeral, Dr. Génessier and his {{assistant}} Louise, {{the woman who had}} disposed of the dead body earlier, return home <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> Christiane is hidden (it is explained that Louise is deathlessly loyal to Génessier because he repaired her own badly damaged face, leaving only a barely noticeable scar she covers with a pearl choker). The body belonged to a young woman who died following Dr. Génessier's unsuccessful attempt to graft her face onto his daughter's. Dr. Génessier promises to restore Christiane's face and insists that she wear a mask to cover her disfigurement. After her father leaves the room, Christiane calls her fiancé Jacques Vernon, who works with Dr. Génessier at his clinic, but hangs up without saying a word.|$|E

25|$|During the May 2007 special Saturday Night Live in the '90s: Pop Culture Nation, Norm Macdonald said {{he created}} the Celebrity Jeopardy! sketch purely {{as an excuse to}} do his Burt Reynolds impersonation. Macdonald also claims that Reynolds is a fan of the sketch and that there were talks to do a sketch <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> Reynolds would crash the game and punch out Macdonald. Reynolds would then play the {{remainder}} of the game, with his responses being even dumber than Macdonald's. However, Macdonald was fired from SNL before that sketch could be written.|$|E

The interiors of several historic buildings, especially Colony House, were used as sets for scenes in the film.|$|E

500|$|Breaking {{started out}} {{strictly}} as toprock, footwork-oriented dance moves performed while standing up. Toprock usually {{serves as the}} opening to a breaker's performance before transitioning into other dance moves performed on the floor. A separate dance style that influenced toprock is uprock, also called rocking or Brooklyn uprock, because it comes from Brooklyn, New York. The uprock dance style {{has its roots in}} gangs. Although it looks similar to toprock, uprock is danced with a partner and is more aggressive, involving fancy footwork, shuffles, hitting motions, and movements that mimic fighting. When there was an issue over , the two warlords of the feuding gangs would uprock, and whoever won this preliminary dance battle decided <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>real</b> fight would be. Because uprock's purpose was to moderate gang violence, it never crossed over into mainstream breaking as seen today, except for some specific moves adopted by breakers who use it as a variation for their toprock.|$|E

In a 1986 interview, Moore said, [...] "What I'd like to explore is the areas that comics succeed in where no other media is capable of operating", and emphasized this by stressing the differences between comics and film. Moore said that Watchmen {{was designed to be}} read [...] "four or five times", with some links and allusions only becoming apparent to the reader after several readings. Dave Gibbons notes that, [...] "s it progressed, Watchmen became much more about the telling than the tale itself. The main thrust of the story essentially hinges on what is called a macguffin, a gimmick [...] So really the plot itself is of no great consequence [...] it just really isn't the most interesting thing about Watchmen.
