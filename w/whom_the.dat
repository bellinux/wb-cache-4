5|$|According to Clan MacLeod tradition, Leod {{inherited}} {{some of his}} lands from {{a foster}} father, who was a sheriff of the Hebridean island of Skye; other lands he inherited from his father-in-law, {{who was also a}} lord on Skye. MacLeod tradition also states that Leod was the father of four sons and two daughters. Two of these sons founded the two main branches of MacLeods; branches which exist to this day—Tormod (from <b>whom</b> <b>the</b> MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan descend) and Torquil (from <b>whom</b> <b>the</b> MacLeods of Lewis descend). The traditional belief that Torquil was a son has also been challenged; the current understanding is that he was a great-grandson of Leod. In recent years, the DNA evidence of men bearing surnames equating to MacLeod has revealed that a certain proportion share a common ancestor—an ancestor considered to have been the clan's founder.|$|E
