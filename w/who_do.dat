40|$|Background: Numerous {{individual}} characteristics {{have been found}} to be associated with rates of ob-taining flu shots. This study creates a predictive model that assesses the relative impact of each of these factors on increasing rates of flu shots in a population. Methods: The Medicare beneficiary survey from 1998 and 1999 was used. Sixteen factors present in 1998 were compared between subjects <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive flu shots. Significant factors were then used in a logistic regression to predict the probability of receiving a flu shot in 1998 and 1999. Results: Seven demographic and 7 health status measures were significantly different between sub-jects <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive flu shots in 1998. Logistic regression showed that twelve of these variables were associated with a subject receiving a flu shot in 1998 and explained 11. 4 % of the vari-ability in <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive a flu shot. For the following year, 1999, 7 measures were significantly associated with receiving a flu shot and explained 64 % of the variability in <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive a flu shot. One variable, if the subject had received a flu shot in 1998, was highly predic-tive of a subject receiving a flu shot in 1999, explaining 63 % of the observed variability in <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not receive a flu shot in 1999...|$|R

5|$|Another {{political}} issue surrounding the double burden is {{what sort of}} policies directly or indirectly affect those <b>who</b> <b>do</b> domestic work. Some policies that companies have, such as a lower rate for part-time workers or firing workers when they get pregnant {{can be seen as}} disempowering women. Debate as to whether this is gender segregation continues. On one side, only women get pregnant and there is a disproportionate number of women <b>who</b> <b>do</b> part-time work instead of full-time, suggesting that there should be allowances made for women. However, there is also the argument that similar to men who fail to meet the standards of the company and cannot comply with their contract, women who cannot perform work at the performance expected of them should be given the proportionate number of benefits and given no exceptions over men.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy for {{prostate}} cancer may cause erectile dysfunction in approximately 15-30% of patients.

Prevalence estimation to determine the impact if persons not providing specimens had higher prevalence rates than those <b>who</b> <b>did.</b> ResultsComparing those <b>who</b> provided specimens with those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not, {{there was no significant}} difference by age, residence, education, marital status, perceived risk, sexual experience or number of sex partners for women. A significant difference by sexual experience was found for men. Prevalence estimates did not change substantially when prevalence was assumed to be two times higher for persons not providing specimens.

40|$|Object. In a {{randomized}} controlled trial comparing surgery and prolonged conservative treatment for sciatica of 6 - 12 weeks' duration, {{more than one-third}} of patients assigned to conservative treatment underwent surgery. The objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate whether MRI at baseline could have predicted this delayed surgery. Methods. Independently evaluated qualitative and quantitative MRI findings were compared between those patients <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not undergo surgery during follow-up in the conservative care group. In addition, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess how well MRI parameters discriminated between those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not undergo delayed surgery (0. 5 - 0. 7 poor discrimination, ≥ 0. 7 acceptable discrimination). Results. Of 142 patients assigned to receive prolonged conservative care, 55 patients (39 %) received delayed surgery. Of the 55 surgically treated patients, 71 % had definite nerve root compression at baseline compared with 72 % of conservatively treated patients (p = 0. 76). Large disc herniations (size > 50 % of spinal canal) were nearly equally distributed between those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not undergo surgery (25 % vs 21 %, p = 0. 65). The size of the dural sac was smaller in the patients who underwent surgery (101. 2 vs 122. 9 mm 2, p = 0. 01). However, the size of the dural sac discriminated poorly between those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not undergo delayed surgery (area under ROC curve, 0. 62). Conclusions. In patients who suffered from sciatica of 6 - 12 weeks' duration, MRI at baseline did not distinguish between patients <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and those <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not undergo delayed surgery.

5|$|In RRMS {{they are}} {{modestly}} effective at decreasing {{the number of}} attacks. The interferons and glatiramer acetate are first-line treatments and are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30%. Early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and improves outcomes. Natalizumab reduces the relapse rate more than first-line agents; however, due to issues of adverse effects is a second-line agent reserved for those <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not respond to other treatments or with severe disease. Mitoxantrone, whose use is limited by severe adverse effects, is a third-line option for those <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not respond to other medications. Treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) with interferons decreases the chance of progressing to clinical MS. Efficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate in children has been estimated to be roughly equivalent to that of adults. The role of some newer agents such as fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate, as of 2011, is not yet entirely clear.|$|E
