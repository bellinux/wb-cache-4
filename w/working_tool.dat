Mathematical modelling that using a systemic approach of the phenomena and processes and realistic assumptions, allows the optimum constructive-functional parameters for soil <b>working</b> <b>tools,</b> in order to achieve a properly working with low energy consumption. Storage capacity of the sediment profiles achieved by ground shaping is properly estimated according to the geo- climatic conditions of the area. Previous researches (Cardei, Cota, 2008) led to the establishment of a calculation model in this respect. The method of calculation for choosing the geometry of profiles is the application of the final investigations, in conditions to assure a satisfactory storage capacity of sediments and a minimum energy consumption for the soil working processes...|$|R

The work also includes the results of field measurement of draught force and quality evaluation of the work of three selected prototypes of chisel tines. This results were used to find out the relationship between specific draught and soil-aggregate size distribution on different widths of chisels and their working depth. For all widths of tines, a significant growth in specific draught was found with increasing working depth. The specific draught significantly correlated with the cross-section area of the loosened soil (correlation coefficient 0, 808) ...|$|R
