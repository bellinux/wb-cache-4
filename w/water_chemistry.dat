In 1991, the Lackawanna River Corridor Association gathered data on the <b>water</b> <b>chemistry</b> and biological habitats of Leggetts Creek. In 2012, the South Abington Sewer Authority began upgrading its sewage treatment plant to prevent wastewater and nutrient pollution from entering the creek. They also installed new sewer lines, including some that run parallel to or under the creek. PA Trout Unlimited's AMD Technical Assistance Program conducted a survey of the fish population in the creek on November 15, 2013.

Well water downgradient of the mines had lower saturation indices than tailings pond water which discredits the claim that tailings-pond recharge is acquiring salts as it percolates to the aquifer.

40|$|The {{mixing of}} {{the waters of the}} Salt and Verde Rivers was studied and modeled. The river waters mix for three and one-third miles between their {{confluence}} and Granite Reef Dam, where they are diverted into canals. Mixing is frequently incomplete, and as the natural <b>water</b> <b>chemistries</b> differ, the canal <b>water</b> <b>chemistries</b> frequently differ. The mixing of the river waters was modeled mathematically {{with the use of a}} two-dimensional form of the convection- dispersion equation. A finite-difference solution of the equation was used in the development of a computer program. The model was calibrated using flow and tracer data collected at a discharge of 1050 c. f. s. from the onethird mile reach immediately below the confluence. The model adequately simulated mixing at the discharge at which data were obtained. Mixing was found to be relatively rapid, requiring an average value of k, the ratio of the dispersion coefficient to the shear velocity and depth, equal to 3. 2. Simulation of a higher discharge of 5340 c. f. s., however, required a much lower value of k, 0. 6. This difference is assumed to be due to the effects of channel geometry on the rate of dispersion...|$|R

Environmental assessment of archaeological sites will also require that environmental conditions (<b>water</b> <b>chemistry,</b> dynamic properties) as well as the natural organisms present on the site are recorded.

Salt content, or salinity, is the most basic measure of water conditions. An aquarium may have freshwater (salinity below 500parts per million), simulating a lake or river environment; brackish water (a salt level of 500 to 30,000PPM), simulating environments lying between fresh and salt, such as estuaries; and salt water or seawater (a salt level of 30,000 to 40,000PPM), simulating an ocean environment. Rarely, higher salt concentrations are maintained in specialized tanks for raising brine organisms.|$|E
30|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that the water that created the mud flow during the 2015 eruption seems to be ordinary ground water from this region rather than of pure geothermal origin as indicated from chemical components of the water.

40|$|In {{the design}} of {{foundations}} of structures, especially light buildings, on clayey soils, the main soil behaviours to be considered are swelling properties and surface heave. Therefore, determination of swelling properties by means of swell percent and maximum swell pressure as well as estimation of the surface {{is very important in}} the investigation of such soils and light structures on them. In order to obtain the swelling parameters of clayey soils, experimental laboratory tests were carried out and standardised. Distilled water is generally used during these experimental tests; however, the soil in situ interacts with different types of water having different <b>water</b> <b>chemistries.</b> Therefore, the swelling behaviour of expansive soils tested with distilled water would naturally be different from the behaviour of expansive soils tested with different <b>water</b> types and <b>chemistries.</b> For this reason, it was anticipated that determination of the realistic swell behaviour in laboratory experiments requires the use of the same water as in the in situ condition. In this article, the effect of the <b>water</b> type and <b>chemistry</b> on the swelling behaviour of the clays was investigated by testing the clay samples with eight different types of water collected from the sea, river, lake and different rock formations. The main result of this research was that the anticipated clay swell percentages and pressures for different types of water were lower than for the distilled water routinely used in testing.

25|$|Fry of {{this species}} are {{particularly}} sensitive to changes in <b>water</b> <b>chemistry</b> and to elevated temperatures. While adult fishes can withstand temperatures of 28°C, fry will die of heat stress if exposed to temperatures above 26°C, and their chances of survival are enhanced if the water temperature is kept at 22°C or below. Water changes made to a nursery aquarium during the first 21 days of life of the fry—the critical period during which they manifest the greatest sensitivity to their environment—must be gradual, and the incoming water conditioned to match that of the existing aquarium water where possible before the water change takes place.
