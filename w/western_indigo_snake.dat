5000|$|Humans {{represent}} {{the biggest threat}} to <b>indigo</b> <b>snakes.</b> Highway fatalities, wanton killings, and overcollection for the pet trade adversely affect <b>indigo</b> <b>snake</b> populations. Snakes are taken illegally from the wild for the pet trade. Eastern <b>indigo</b> <b>snakes</b> are sometimes [...] "gassed" [...] in their burrows by rattlesnake hunters.|$|R
50|$|Eastern <b>indigo</b> <b>snakes</b> have {{a number}} of common names {{including}} <b>indigo,</b> blue <b>indigo</b> <b>snake,</b> black snake, blue gopher snake, and blue bull snake.|$|R
50|$|The eastern <b>indigo</b> <b>snake</b> {{ranges from}} {{southern}} South Carolina south through Florida and west to Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. A related species, the Texas <b>indigo</b> <b>snake</b> (Drymarchon melanurus erebennus), {{is found in}} southern Texas and Mexico.|$|R
50|$|The unicolor cribo (Drymarchon melanurus unicolor) is a Central American {{subspecies}} of the cribo <b>snakes.</b> The eastern <b>indigo</b> <b>snake,</b> Drymarchon corais couperi {{is another}} species of this genus. Until recently the unicolor cribo {{was considered a}} subspecies {{of the same species}} as the <b>indigo</b> <b>snake</b> Drymarchon corais unicolor.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the cover}} {{requirements}} of eastern <b>indigo</b> <b>snakes</b> change seasonally, maintaining corridors that link the different habitats used is important. From the spring through fall snakes {{must be able}} to travel from sandhill communities and upland pine-hardwood communities to creek bottoms and agricultural fields. In winter, <b>indigo</b> <b>snakes</b> den in gopher tortoise burrows, which are usually found in open pine forests with dense herbaceous understories. Burrows need to be in areas where there is no flooding. Eastern <b>indigo</b> <b>snakes</b> heavily use debris piles left from site-preparation operations on tree plantations. These piles are often destroyed for cosmetic reasons but should be left intact because they provide important hiding cover for both the snake and its prey. Summer home ranges for the <b>indigo</b> <b>snake</b> can be as large as 273 acre.|$|R

50|$|Eastern <b>indigo</b> <b>snakes</b> {{frequent}} flatwoods, hammocks, dry glades, stream bottoms, cane fields, riparian thickets, {{and high}} ground with well-drained, sandy soils. In Georgia, eastern <b>indigo</b> <b>snakes</b> prefer excessively drained, deep sandy soils along major streams, {{as well as}} xeric sandridge habitats. Xeric slash pine plantations seem to be preferred over undisturbed longleaf pine habitats. Habitat selection varies seasonally. From December to April, eastern <b>indigo</b> <b>snakes</b> prefer sandhill habitats; from May to July the snakes shift from winter dens to summer territories; from August through November they are located more frequently in shady creek bottoms than during other seasons.|$|R
