Loose faeces were found in group B (Ranitidine) during last few days of experimental period. Following post-mortem examination, congestion and pale colour of the liver was found in group C and D respectively. In the treatment group B (Ranitidine), TEC, TLC, Hb%, Monocyte, Neutrophil and Eosinophil count were significantly decreased <b>whereas</b> <b>Lymphocyte</b> was significantly increased in the same treatment group. The highest decrease in TEC (16. 08 %), TLC (17. 77 %), Hb% (20. 75 %), Monocyte (33. 33 %), Neutrophil (26. 31 %), Eosinophil (33. 33 %) was recorded.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} the present study was to analyze the effect of perches and footpad {{dermatitis}} on stress and fear levels of chickens. In experiment 1 hetero-phil to lymphocyte ratio and tonic immobility duration were measured in 36 -wk-old hens (36 birds) from 2 Span-ish breeds of chickens (Black Menorca and Quail Castellana) housed in pens with or without perches from 20 wk of age. There was a significant difference in the heterophil to lymphocyte ratio between perch treatments (P < 0. 05), the ratio of hens with perches being lower than that of hens without perches. Hens with perches had significant lymphophilia (P < 0. 05). There was no signifi-cant difference for the duration of tonic immobility be-tween hens with or without perches. Thus, hens with perches were less stressed than hens without perches, as indicated by the heterophil to lymphocyte ratio. Hetero-phil to lymphocyte ratio and heterophil number for Black Menorcas were significantly smaller (P < 0. 001) than for Quail Castellanas, <b>whereas</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> number wa...|$|E
40|$|Uncoupling protein 2 (UCP 2) is {{an inner}} {{mitochondrial}} membrane protein. Although the protein {{was discovered in}} 1997, its function and even its tissue distribution are still under debate. Here we present a quantitative analysis of mRNA and protein expression in various mice tissues, revealing that UCP 2 is mainly expressed in organs and cells associated with the immune system. Although the UCP 2 gene {{is present in the}} brain, as demonstrated using quantitative RT-PCR, the protein was not detectable in neurons under physiological conditions. Instead, we could detect UCP 2 in microglia, which act in the immune defense of the central nervous system. In lymphocytes, activation led to a ten-fold increase of UCP 2 protein expression simultaneously to the increase in levels of other mitochondrial proteins, <b>whereas</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> re-stimulation resulted in the selective increase of UCP 2. The highest detected level of UCP 2 expression in stimulated T-cells (0. 54 ng/(µg total cellular protein)) was approximately 200 times lower than the level of UCP 1 in brown adipose tissue from room temperature acclimated mice. Both the UCP 2 expression pattern and the time course of up-regulation in stimulated T-cells imply UCP 2 's involvement in the immune response, probably by controlling the metabolism during cell proliferation...|$|E

This serum abnormality improved with therapy and could not be clearly correlated with the degree of malnutrition, {{the presence or absence of}} infection or other laboratory manifestations of kwashiorkor. These observations indicate that defective cellular immune reactions in kwashiorkor may be symptomatic of a lack of some humoral factor and do not necessarily reflect an intrinsic cellular defect...|$|R
5|$|Like chondrostean fish, {{the major}} immune tissues of bony fish (or teleostei) include the kidney (especially the {{anterior}} kidney), which houses many different immune cells. In addition, teleost fish possess a thymus, spleen and scattered immune areas within mucosal tissues (e.g. in the skin, gills, gut and gonads). Much like the mammalian immune system, teleost erythrocytes, neutrophils and granulocytes {{are believed to}} reside in the spleen <b>whereas</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> are the major cell type found in the thymus. In 2006, a lymphatic system {{similar to that in}} mammals was described in one species of teleost fish, the zebrafish. Although not confirmed as yet, this system presumably will be where naive (unstimulated) T cells accumulate while waiting to encounter an antigen.|$|R
40|$|In pig production, {{pregnant}} sows {{are either}} housed in individual crates or in groups, {{the latter being}} mandatory in the EU since 2013. The consequences of different housing conditions on the immune system are however poorly investigated, although immunological alterations may have severe consequences for the animal’s health, performance, and welfare. This study assessed measures of blood celluar immunity with special emphasis on T cells in pregnant German Landrace sows either housed in individual crates or in a social group. Blood samples were taken at four samplings pre partum to evaluate numbers of lymphocyte subpopulations, mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine-producing T cells. Plasma cortisol concentrations were evaluated {{as an indicator of}} stress. We found lower blood lymphocyte numbers (p < 0. 01) in individually housed as opposed to group-housed sows, an effect due to lower numbers of cytotoxic T cells, naive TH cells, and CD 8 + gd-T cells. Individually housed sows showed higher cortisol concentrations (p < 0. 01), <b>whereas</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> functionality did not differ between sows of both housing systems. Possible implications and underlying mechanisms for the endocrine and immunological differences are discussed. We favor the hypothesis that differences in the stressfulness of the environment contributed to the effects, with crate-housing being a more stressful environment—at least under conditions of this study...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{glucocorticoids}} (Gc) {{produced during}} stress have profound {{effects on the}} immune system. It {{is well known that}} Gc induce apoptosis in precursor T and B cells, markedly altering lymphopoiesis. However, it has been noted that marrow myeloid cells expanded both in proportion and absolute numbers in the mouse after Gc exposure. Mice were implanted with a corticosterone (CS) tablet that increased serum Gc and caused atrophied thymuses, both classic signs of activation of the stress axis. Blood neutrophil counts were elevated (4. 8 ×), <b>whereas</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> counts declined. Flow cytometric analysis of the marrow revealed that the phenotypic distribution of the various major classes of cells was shifted by Gc exposure. As expected, marrow lymphocyte numbers declined > 40 % after 3 days of exposure to Gc. Conversely, in the myeloid compartment, both monocytes and granulocytes increased in number by > 40 %. Further, all granulocyte developmental stages showed large increases in both total number and percentage of cells. To investigate the functional capacity of mature granulocytes from Gc-treated mice, an improved granulocyte isolation method was developed. Gc exposure had little effect on the ability of granulocytes to produce superoxide or undergo chemotaxis or phagocytose bacteria. These results indicate that Gc treatment shifts bone marrow composition and provides evidence that granulocytes and their progenitors are selectively preserved under stressful conditions without losing function...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Patient-related {{variables}} such as physical exercise stress and fasting status are Important sources of variability in laboratory testing However no clear indications about tasting requirements exist for routine haematological tests nor has the influence of meals been assessed Methods We studied 17 healthy volunteers who consumed a light meal containing a standardized amount of carbohydrates, protein and lipids Blood was taken for routine haematological tests before the meal and 1 2 and 4 hours thereafter Results One hour after the meal neutrophil count and mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MHC) increased significantly <b>whereas</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> and monocyte counts red blood cell distribution width, haematocrit, and mean corpuscular volume decreased significantly A clinically significant variation was only observed for lymphocytes Two hours after the meal a significant increase was observed for neutrophils and MCH whereas lymphocytes eosinophils, haemoglobin and haematocrit decreased significantly Clinically significant variations were recorded for lymphocytes red blood cells (RBC), haemoglobin haematocrit and MCH Four hours after the meal MCH was significantly increased while lymphocytes eosinophils, RBC, haemoglobin and haematocrit were significantly decreased Clinically significant variations were recorded for neutrophils eosinophils RBC hematocrit and MCH Conclusion The significant variation of several haematological parameters after a light meal demonstrates that the fasting time needs to be carefully considered in order {{to interpret the results}} of haematological tests correctl...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Macrophage {{activation}} by cytokines provides only {{a partial}} explanation of antimycobacterial immunity in man. Because cytolytic T lymphocytes {{have been shown to}} contribute to immunity in animal models of intracellular infection, the generation of mycobacterial antigen specific cytotoxic T cells was examined in the peripheral blood of patients with tuberculosis. METHODS: Subjects comprised 36 patients with active tuberculosis (18 newly diagnosed) and 32 healthy volunteers, of whom 25 had had BCG vaccination and seven were Mantoux negative. The ability of purified protein derivative (PPD) stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes to lyse autologous, mycobacterial antigen bearing macrophages was examined by using a chromium 51 release assay. RESULTS: PPD stimulated lymphocytes from normal, Mantoux positive, BCG vaccinated subjects produced high levels of PPD specific cytolysis, <b>whereas</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> from unvaccinated, uninfected subjects caused little or no cytolysis. The generation of cytolytic T lymphocytes by patients with tuberculosis was related to their clinical state. Those with cavitating pulmonary disease or lymph node tuberculosis generated PPD specific lymphocytes with cytotoxic ability similar to that of those from Mantoux positive control subjects, <b>whereas</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> from patients with non-cavitating pulmonary infiltrates showed poor antigen specific cytolysis. After seven days of stimulation with PPD in vitro, lymphoblasts contained both CD 4 + and CD 8 + cells. Mycobacterial antigen specific cytolysis was restricted to the CD 4 + cell population and was blocked by monoclonal antibodies directed against major histocompatibility class II (MHC) antigens. CONCLUSION: CD 4 + cytolytic T cells can lyse autologous macrophages presenting mycobacterial antigen and were found in patients with cavitating pulmonary tuberculosis or tuberculous lymphadenitis and in normal, Mantoux positive control subjects. The ability to generate these T cell responses seems to be a marker for response to mycobacteria and may contribute to tissue damage in tuberculosis. These responses do not provide protective immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis but may help in disease localisation...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{measurements}} of morphological parameters, sizes and frequencies of peripheral blood cells (erythrocytes, leukocytes, thrombocytes) on blood smear preparation devices stained with May-Grünwald stain were evaluated for both sexes in 20 Emys trinacris (Testudines: Emydidae) specimens. Erythrocytes were higher in male than in female specimens. The leukocyte of E. trinacris contains eosinophil, basophil, monocyte, heterophil and lymphocyte.

40|$|Introduction: Prevention and {{effective}} treatment of radiation-induced pneumonitis (RP) could facilitate {{greater use of}} radiation therapy (RT) for lung cancer. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine clinical parameters useful for early prediction of RP. Methods: Blood sampling, pulmonary function testing, chest computed tomography, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed in patients with pathologically confirmed lung cancer who had completed ≥ 60 Gy of RT, at baseline, shortly after RT, and at 1 month posttreatment. Results: By 3 months post-RT, 11 patients developed RP (RP group) and the remaining 11 patients did not (NRP group). RT significantly increased total cell counts and alveolar macrophages in BAL of the NRP group, <b>whereas</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> count was increased in both groups. Matrix metallopeptidase- 9 (MMP- 9) increased and vascular endothelial growth factor decreased significantly in the BAL fluid (BALF) of the RP group following RT. Serum surfactant protein D (SP-D) increased significantly in the NRP group. SP-D in BALF from the RP group increased significantly with a subsequent increase in serum SP-D. Pulmonary dilution decreased similarly in both groups of patients. Conclusions: Increased SP-D in BALF, rather than that in serum, could be useful biomarkers in predicting RP. The MMP- 9 in BALF might play a role in the pathogenesis of RP. Pulmonary dilution test may not be predictive of the development of RP...|$|E
40|$|It was {{the purpose}} of this study to examine the {{relationship}} between periodontal diseases and melatonin level. Material and Methods:  Forty-six patients with periodontal disease, together with 26 age- and gender-matched healthy controls, were included. Periodontal status was assessed using the Community Periodontal Index. Plasma and salivary melatonin levels were determined using specific commercial radioimmunoassays, <b>whereas</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> subpopulations (e. g. CD 3, CD 4, CD 8, C 19 and natural killer cells) were analyzed using flow cytometry. Results:  Patients with periodontal disease had significantly (p[*]< [*] 0. 001) lower plasma (9. 46 [*]±[*] 3. 18 [*]pg/mL) and saliva (2. 55 [*]±[*] 0. 99 [*]pg/mL) melatonin levels than healthy control patients (14. 33 [*]±[*] 4. 05 and 4. 22 [*]±[*] 0. 87 [*]pg/mL, respectively). A biphasic relationhip was observed between plasma melatonin levels and Community Periodontal Indices. The plasma melatonin level was reduced in patients with a lower Community Periodontal Index value (1 or 2) and increased in patients with a higher Community Periodontal Index value (3 or 4). Salivary melatonin parallels the changes of plasma melatonin. The higher the Community Periodontal Index, the older the patient and the higher the total lymphocyte counts. CD 4 concentrations also increased as the disease worsened. Conclusion:  The results obtained from this study suggest that melatonin could act as a protective function in fighting periodontal infection. However, further studies in this area are encouraged...|$|E
40|$|Twenty pigs were inoculated with a virulent isolate (Quillota strain) of {{classical}} swine fever (CSF) virus to determine the chronological development of lesions in bone marrow. Histopathologic, ultrastructural and immunohistochemical (detection of viral antigen gp 55, myeloid-histiocyte antigen, CD 3 antigen, and FVIII-rag), and morphometric techniques were employed. Viral antigen was detected from 2 days postinfection (dpi) in stromal and haematopoitic cells, and severe atrophy related to apoptosis of haematopoitic cells was observed. Megakaryocytes (MKs) did not show significant changes in number, but there were important qualitative changes including 1) increased numbers of cloud-nuclei MKs, microMKs, apoptotic MKs, and atypical nucleated MKs and 2) decreased number of typical nucleated MKs. Morphometric study of these cells showed a decrease in cytoplasmic area. MK infection was detected from 2 dpi, but in {{a small percentage of}} cells. Myeloid cells showed quantitative changes, with an increase in granulocyte numbers. Apoptosis of lymphocytes and viral infection of erythroblasts were also observed. The main changes in stroma were depletion of T lymphocytes in the middle phase of the experiment and macrophages. Viral infection was also observed in these cells. MK lesions suggest dysmegakaryocytopoiesis, which would aggravate the thrombocytopenia already present and could be responsible for it.

40|$|We {{studied the}} immune {{response}} of wild House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) experimentally challenged with different doses of inactivated Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine. We evaluated within-individual cell-mediated and humoral responses in birds kept in outdoor aviaries, over a 6 -wk period. Nonbreeding adult House Sparrows developed a significant humoral response to NDV experimental vaccination within 1 wk postchallenge, {{as measured by}} hemagglutination inhibition assay; values increased until week 4 and persisted until week 6. Differences among treatments appeared by week 1, with individuals challenged with the highest dose (0. 2 mL) eliciting a higher humoral response than the rest (n =  18). By week 4, all individuals vaccinated displayed an increased humoral response, with individuals challenged with the highest dose remaining significantly above responses of individuals vaccinated with the middle dose (0. 1 mL, n =  14), but not the lowest dose (0. 05 mL, n =  15). The middle and lowest dose responded similarly and significantly different from controls (n =  23). Differences persisted through week 6 postchallenge. Cell-mediated responses were independent of the experimental treatment. All individuals experienced a rise in granulocyte concentration, <b>whereas</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> and monocyte concentrations decreased, most likely {{as a result of}} captivity.

40|$|Aim: The present {{investigation}} was undertaken to elaborate hematobiochemical alterations of acute chlorpyriphos (CPF) toxicity in indigenous chicken. Since {{there is no}} available literature on the detailed hematobiochemical changes of CPF in indigenous chicken, hence, {{the present study was}} designed to establish toxicological effect of CPF on blood biochemical parameters of indigenous chicken which are at a great risk of exposure to pesticides. These will help physiologist, pathologist, and poultry scientists for effective production strategy as well as disease control regime. Materials and Methods: The birds were divided into two major Groups I and II. Group I served as control and Group II was treated with CPF (36 mg/kg). Blood samples were assayed for hemoglobin (Hb), total erythrocyte count (TEC), total leukocyte count (TLC), differential leukocyte count, and biochemical constituents such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), cholinesterase (CHE), total protein, and uric acid. Results: Hb, TEC, and TLC levels increased significantly (p< 0. 01) in toxin fed birds, <b>whereas,</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> percent decreased significantly, and heterophil percent increased significantly. Serum ALP, AST, ALT, and uric acid increased significantly in CPF treated birds. Decreased serum CHE values were observed in CPF fed group. The protein level remained almost same.

40|$|Background: Weaning {{involves}} the permanent {{separation of the}} calf from the dam and {{has been shown to}} be stressful for both. The objectives of this study were to characterise the effect of i) abrupt weaning and ii) subsequent housing on the extended physiological and immunological responses of beef cows. At weaning (day (d) 0, mean age of calf (s. d.) 212 (24. 5) d), cows were abruptly separated from their calves and returned to the grazing area. After 35 d at pasture, cows were housed in a slatted floor shed and offered grass silage ad libitum plus a mineral-vitamin supplement daily. Rectal body temperature was recorded and blood samples were obtained on i) d 0 (weaning), 2, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and subsequently on ii) d 0 (housing), 2, 7, 14 and 21 for physiological, haematological and immunological measurements. Results: Post-weaning, concentration of cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone were unchanged (P > 0. 05). Rectal body temperature, neutrophil number and neutrophil: lymphocyte ratio increased (P 0. 05). On d 2 posthousing, neutrophil number and neutrophil: lymphocyte ratio increased (P < 0. 05), <b>whereas</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> number and concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone, fibrinogen and non-esterified fatty acid decreased (P < 0. 05) compared with pre-housing baseline.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{the timing}} of allergen-induced bronchoconstriction is well defined, there is little {{information}} about the kinetics of allergen-induced leukocyte infiltration in asthma and its comparability between human and animal models of asthma. OBJECTIVE: To investigate systematically allergen-induced leukocyte infiltration into the airway lumen in human and experimental asthma by using bronchoalveolar lavage. METHODS: Patients with allergic asthma were lavaged at different time points as long as 1 week after segmental allergen challenge. Allergen-sensitized mice were lavaged as long as 3 weeks after allergen challenge. Differential cell counts, lymphocyte subsets, and cytokines were assessed in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. RESULTS: In both models, neutrophil infiltration was a relatively early event (maximum: 18 hours after challenge). In contrast, eosinophil infiltration peaked 42 hours (human model) to 4 days (mouse model) after allergen challenge, paralleled by an IL- 5 peak in this period. There were elevated macrophage counts {{over a period of}} several days after allergen challenge in both models. Lymphocytes (predominantly CD 4 + T cells) peaked 18 hours after challenge in the human model, but not until 2 weeks after challenge in the murine model. CONCLUSION: Early neutrophil accumulation (within hours after challenge) and delayed eosinophil accumulation (within days after challenge) in the airway lumen are common features of allergen-induced airway inflammation, <b>whereas</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> kinetics are dependent on the asthma model. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Similarities in the infiltration kinetics of granulocytes after allergen challenge suggest a common role for these cells in asthma, whereas the presumed orchestration of allergic inflammation by lymphocytes appears to differ between the models...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Serum CA- 125 {{during the}} mid-follicular phase has been {{reported}} to be a clinically useful and reproducible marker in the diagnosis of advanced endometriosis in women. This study was undertaken to document the effect of the menstrual cycle, pregnancy and lymphocyte suppression on CA- 125 levels in peritoneal fluid (PF) and serum in baboons with a normal pelvis and baboons with endometriosis. METHODS: CA- 125 levels were measured in 264 serum samples that were serially obtained during one menstrual cycle from 10 animals with and without endometriosis. In addition, CA- 125 levels were determined in 204 archived samples (serum, n = 112 and PF, n = 92) obtained from 32 female baboons with or without endometriosis. The CA- 125 assays were performed by radioimmunoassay using kits from Centocor (Malvern, PA, USA). RESULTS: Serum CA- 125 levels were at their highest during menstruation and decreased progressively during the follicular and luteal phase. PF CA- 125 levels were increased during the follicular phase in baboons with a normal pelvis, but no cyclic changes were observed in animals with endometriosis. Serum CA- 125 levels were unaffected by induction, lymphocyte suppression or pregnancy. Induction of endometriosis resulted in increased PF CA- 125 levels, <b>whereas</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> suppression or pregnancy had no effect. CONCLUSION: In baboons, serum CA- 125 originates mainly from eutopic endometrium whereas the main source of PF CA- 125 seems to be the peritoneum or ectopic endometrium.

40|$|In pig husbandry, {{pregnant}} {{females are}} often exposed to stressful conditions {{that may affect}} their physiology, behavior or health and consequently their offspring ability to survive and develop. This study compared two different housing systems from insemination to 106 days of gestation, a conventional (C) and an enriched one (E), for maternal cortisol and immune parameters, {{as well as for}} the immune function and survival of their offspring. C and E systems differed essentially for the housing design (slatted floor, 2. 4 m 2 per sow vs. a deep straw litter and 3. 4 m 2 per sow). Results from Exp. 1 (n = 108) demonstrated that C sows had higher salivary cortisol than E sows at gestational day 102 (DG 102). Results from Exp. 2 (n = 48) showed that, at DG 102, C sows had higher granulocyte counts and total plasma immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration than E sows, <b>whereas</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> number, haematocrit and haptoglobin plasma concentration were similar. Results from Exp. 3 (n = 47) showed that plasma IgG level at 5 and 27 days of age, hematocrit, white blood cell numbers and in vitro lymphocyte proliferation of piglets at 27 days of age were not influenced by maternal housing conditions. However, reproductive data collected in Exp. 2 and 3 indicated that pre-weaning mortality was higher in C than E litters. In conclusion, the C system was associated with markers of increased stress and microbial aggression in gestating sows, and with greater piglet mortality during the suckling period without identified alterations in piglet immune function...|$|E
40|$|The bursa of Fabricius is {{critical}} for B cell development and differentiation in chick embryos. This study describes the production in vitro, from dissociated cell suspensions, of cellular agglomerates with functional similarities to the chicken bursa. Co-cultivation of epithelial and lymphoid cells obtained from embryos at the appropriate developmental stage regularly led to agglomerate formation within 48 hours. These agglomerates resembled bursal tissue in having lymphoid clusters overlaid by well organized epithelium. <b>Whereas</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> within agglomerates were predominantly Bu- 1 a(+), a majority of those emigrating onto the supporting membrane were Bu- 1 a(-) and IgM(+). Both agglomerates and emigrant cells expressed activation-induced deaminase with levels increasing after 24 hours. Emigrating cells were actively proliferating at a rate in excess of both the starting cell population and the population of cells remaining in agglomerates. The potential usefulness of this system for investigating the response of bursal tissue to avian Newcastle disease virus (strain AF 2240) was examined...|$|R
40|$|Circulating {{peripheral}} blood lymphocyte subpopulations were analysed in patients with primary intracranial neoplasia. Patients with tumours of glial origin demonstrated a significant depletion of E-rosetting <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>whereas</b> the quantitative <b>lymphocyte</b> profiles of patients with non-glial brain tumours were normal. The number of immunoglobulin and Fe receptor-bearing cells was not significantly altered in any group of patients: however, the EAC-RFC subpopulation was increased in those with malignant gliomas. Two hypotheses are suggested to explain these observations: first, the presence of cross-reacting antibody between T cells and brain (glial) cells, and secondly, the proliferation of EAC-RFC in response to malignant degeneration...|$|R

40|$|Mycoplasma fermentans-derived high-molecular-weight {{material}} (MDHM) {{was originally}} discovered {{because of its}} capacity to generate, through the induction of monokine synthesis, cytolytic T lymphocytes in concanavalin A-stimulated thymocyte cultures. This study shows that MDHM-activated macrophages not only released interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) but also exhibited increased synthesis of cell-associated IL- 1 as well as liberation of tumor necrosis factor and prostaglandin. We determined 6 -keto prostaglandin F 1 alpha {{since it is the}} stable metabolite of the bioactive prostacyclin. MDHM appeared to be as potent as lipopolysaccharide in inducing the synthesis of these mediators. Priming with gamma interferon further increased MDHM-mediated IL- 6 release. Since monokines can be pyrogenic, we tested the effects of an intravenous injection of MDHM on rectal temperatures and leukocyte counts in rabbits. At 1 h after a bolus injection of MDHM, leukocyte counts dropped to about 35 % of the initial values, reflecting a decrease in both lymphocytes and granulocytes. At 4 to 6 h after injection, granulocyte counts began to increase again, <b>whereas</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> counts remained low. No leukocytosis was noted during this time. The lack of leukocytosis {{can be explained by the}} failure of MDHM-stimulated macrophages to release IL- 1. The property of MDHM to cause IL- 6 release from macrophages and the IL- 6 growth dependency of the 7 TD 1 hybridoma cell line were made use of in a coculture assay system to quantitate the activity of MDHM. With this method and macrophages from C 3 H/HeJ lipopolysaccharide-nonresponder mice, MDHM activity was found to be equally distributed in the mycoplasma growth medium and the sedimented mycoplasmas after sonication...|$|E
40|$|Identifying the {{immunologic}} and virologic {{consequences of}} discontinuing antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients is of major importance in developing long-term treatment strategies {{for patients with}} HIV- 1 infection. We designed a trial to characterize these parameters after interruption of {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) in patients who had maintained prolonged viral suppression on antiretroviral drugs. Eighteen patients with CD 4 + T cell counts ≥ 350 cells/μl and viral load below the limits of detection for ≥ 1 year while on HAART were enrolled prospectively in a trial in which HAART was discontinued. Twelve of these patients had received prior IL- 2 therapy and had low frequencies of resting, latently infected CD 4 cells. Viral load relapse to > 50 copies/ml occurred in all 18 patients independent of prior IL- 2 treatment, beginning most commonly during weeks 2 – 3 after cessation of HAART. The mean relapse rate constant was 0. 45 (0. 20 log 10 copies) day− 1, which was very similar to the mean viral clearance rate constant after drug resumption of 0. 35 (0. 15 log 10 copies) day− 1 (P = 0. 28). One patient experienced a relapse delay to week 7. All patients except one experienced a relapse burden to > 5, 000 RNA copies/ml. Ex vivo labeling with BrdUrd showed that CD 4 and CD 8 cell turnover increased after withdrawal of HAART and correlated with viral load <b>whereas</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> turnover decreased after reinitiation of drug treatment. Virologic relapse occurs rapidly in patients who discontinue suppressive drug therapy, even in patients with a markedly diminished pool of resting, latently infected CD 4 + T cells...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundCD 4 +T {{lymphocyte}} {{measurements are}} the most important indicator of mortality in HIV-infected individuals in resource-limited settings. There is currently a lack of comprehensive immunophenotyping data from African populations to guide the immunologic assessment of HIV infection. ObjectiveTo quantify variation in absolute and relative lymphocyte subsets with age in healthy Malawians. MethodsLymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood of 539 healthy HIV-uninfected Malawians stratified by age were enumerated by flow cytometry. ResultsB and T–lymphocyte and T-lymphocyte subset absolute concentrations peaked in early childhood then decreased to adult levels, <b>whereas</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> subset proportions demonstrated much less variation with age. Adult lymphocyte subsets were similar to those in developed countries. In contrast, high B-lymphocyte and CD 8 +T-lymphocyte levels among children under 2 years, relative to those in developed countries, resulted in low CD 4 +T-lymphocyte percentages that varied little between 0  and 5 years (35 % to 39 %). The CD 4 +T-lymphocyte percentages in 35 % of healthy children under 1 year and 18 % of children age 1 to 3 years were below the World Health Organization threshold defining immunodeficiency in HIV-infected children in resource-limited settings. Thirteen percent of healthy children under 18 months old had a CD 4 :CD 8 T-lymphocyte ratio < 1. 0, which is commonly associated with HIV infection. All immunologic parameters except absolute natural killer lymphocyte concentration varied significantly with age, and percentage and overall absolute CD 4 +T-lymphocyte counts were higher in females than males. ConclusionAlthough lymphocyte subsets in Malawian adults are similar to those from developed countries, CD 4 +T-lymphocyte percentages in young children are comparatively low. These findings need to be considered when assessing the severity of HIV-related immunodeficiency in African children under 3 years...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} infections with {{influenza}} A in animal models have stressed the tro-pism of this virus {{for the upper}} respiratory tract. To assess the interaction of influenza A virus with human respiratory tissue, we maintained adenoids, consisting of ciliated epi-thelium with underlying lymphoid follicles, in organ culture. When the organ cultures were inoculated with wild-type influenza A/Alaska (H 3 N 2), epithelial damage and migra-tion of inflammatory cells from the follicles into the lamina propria were seen. Growth of the virus and ciliary damage in infected organ cultures from seronegative donors were significantly greater than that seen in organ cultures from seropositive donors. Adenoidal lymphocytes were then studied to determine which factors might modulate infectivity. Specific in vitro production of antibody to influenza A/Alaska was demonstrated by adenoi-dal lymphocytes from seropositive donors, <b>whereas</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> from seronegative donors did not produce antibody. The human adenoid organ culture provides an attractive model to study the pathogenesis of influenza A infections and the resultant local immune response. Infections with influenza A viruses remain {{a major cause of}} illness in adults and children. The primar...|$|R
40|$|Oral {{estrogen}} treatment increases thrombotic risk. Tissue factor (TF), {{tissue factor}} pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and platelet interaction with leukocytes are important determinant of thrombogenesis. Thereby, {{the present study}} was designed to define and compare platelet TF and TFPI mRNA and adhesion protein expression in platelets derived from animals treated with different types of oral estrogens. Ovariectomized pigs were treated with either 17 β-estradiol (2 mg/day), conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) 0. 625 mg/day, or raloxifene 60 mg/day for four weeks. Compared to intact animals, ovariectomy and treatment differentially affected populations of leukocytes: neutrophils decreased <b>whereas</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> increased significantly four weeks after ovariectomy and with 17 β-estradiol and CEE treatments; eosinophils increased only with 17 β-estradiol treatment. Content of TF protein increased in platelets from 17 β–estradiol and raloxifene treated pigs whereas TF mRNA was detected only in platelets from 17 β-estradiol and CEE treated pigs. TFPI mRNA increased in platelets following OVX and estrogen treatment. Only a trace of TFPI protein was detected but a higher molecular weight protein was observed in all treatment groups. Expression of CD 40 and CD 40 ligan...|$|R
40|$|Cord blood {{lymphocytes}} were stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) {{to produce}} interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) and immune interferon (IFN-gamma). On PHA stimulation, cord blood lymphocytes produced efficiently IL- 2 {{as much as}} adult ones. Antiviral activity generated on PHA stimulation was shown to consist mainly of IFN-gamma as assessed by the sensitivity to pH 2. 0 treatment and neutralization with anti-human IFN-gamma antibody. In contrast to IL- 2 production, cord blood lymphocytes released extremely low levels of IFN-gamma following PHA stimulation. The producing ability of IFN-gamma by lymphocytes on PHA stimulation gradually increased with child growth, but was significantly low at 1 - 2 years of age as compared with adult controls. Around 3 {{years of age or}} later, the producing ability of IFN-gamma by lymphocytes on PHA stimulation attained levels comparable to those of adult cells. These results suggested that IL- 2 producing ability of lymphocytes appeared to be at a mature stage at birth, <b>whereas</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> in the early human life might be relatively deficient in their ability to produce IFN-gamma...|$|R
