5|$|Habermas {{argues that}} his ethical theory is an {{improvement}} on Kant's ethics. He rejects the dualistic framework of Kant's ethics. Kant distinguished between the phenomena <b>world,</b> <b>which</b> can be sensed and experienced by humans, and the noumena, or spiritual <b>world,</b> <b>which</b> is inaccessible to humans. This dichotomy {{was necessary for}} Kant because it could explain the autonomy of a human agent: although a human is bound in the phenomenal world, their actions are free in the intelligible world. For Habermas, morality arises from discourse, which is made necessary by their rationality and needs, rather than their freedom.|$|E
