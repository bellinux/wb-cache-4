25|$|The {{massacre}} {{began on}} 13 November at 7:30p.m. when Gray confronted neighbour Garry Holden {{about one of}} Holden's dogs wandering onto his property. After the confrontation, Gray went into his house, retrieved a Norinco 84S semi-automatic rifle, walked outside and shot Holden multiple times in his chest, before <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> him and shooting him fatally through the head.|$|E
25|$|San Francisco stormed back, driving 70 {{yards in}} seven plays on a drive that {{consumed}} only 2:24 {{and ended with}} Garcia's 26-yard touchdown pass to Owens. Owens added a 2-point conversion catch on the next play, cutting the 49ers deficit to 38–22. After the play, an iconic scene of defensive lineman Michael Strahan <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Owens and pointing to the scoreboard {{to remind him of}} the deficit they still faced would be a highlight of the game.|$|E
25|$|Undertaker {{would return}} on the March 6 episode of Raw after Braun Strowman called out Reigns. Strowman left the ring {{following}} a brief staredown with Undertaker, who was then confronted by Reigns. After disrespectful comments were made by Reigns, The Undertaker performed a chokeslam on him. This led to a No Holds Barred match between Undertaker and Reigns at WrestleMania 33 on April 2, where Undertaker lost to Reigns after five spears in his fourth WrestleMania main event. After the match, Undertaker left his gloves, coat and hat {{in the center of}} the ring before slowly making his exit, also <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> his wife Michelle McCool to kiss her, then walked up the ramp and performed his signature arm-raised pose as smoke surrounded him and he descended down into the ramp to the sound of his music. After he disappeared, the lights went out and his signature gong sounded off three times to end the show.|$|E

50|$|The {{epaulette}} shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) tends {{to live in}} shallow waters where swimming is difficult, and can often be seen <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> rocks and sand by using its muscular pectoral fins. It lives in areas of great variation in water depth, usually where the tide falls below its location. If it finds itself out of water, it can survive for several hours, and is capable of <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> land <b>to</b> get to water. This means that it is easily observed by beachgoers in its natural range.|$|R
2500|$|Boxing {{historian}} J. J. Johnston said, [...] "the films show Willard {{upon entering}} the ring <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Dempsey and examining his hands." [...] That, along with an experiment conducted by a boxing magazine designed to re-enact the fight have been noted as proof that Kearns' story was false.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the winter}} of 1815–16 Peacock was {{regularly}} <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> visit Shelley at Bishopgate. There he met Thomas Jefferson Hogg, and [...] "the winter was a mere Atticism. Our studies were exclusively Greek". In 1816 Shelley went abroad, and Peacock {{appears to have been}} entrusted with the task of finding the Shelleys a new residence. He fixed them near his own home at Great Marlow. Peacock received a pension from Shelley for a time, and was put into requisition to keep off wholly unauthorised intruders upon Shelley's hospitable household. Peacock was consulted about alterations in Shelley's Laon and Cythna, and Peacock's enthusiasm for Greek poetry probably had some influence on Shelley's work. Shelley's influence upon Peacock may be traced in the latter's poem of Rhododaphne, or the Thessalian Spell, published in 1818 and Shelley wrote a eulogistic review of it. [...] Peacock also wrote at this time the satirical novels Melincourt published in 1817 and Nightmare Abbey [...] published in 1818. Shelley made his final departure for Italy and the friends' agreement for mutual correspondence produced Shelley's magnificent descriptive letters from Italy, which otherwise might never have been written.|$|E

60|$|Five {{minutes later}} the sixty wedding guests were all <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> the fields <b>to</b> the Cove, with the {{minister}} and the bridegroom {{in the front of}} the procession. They were too amazed even to talk about the strange happening. Isabella Spencer walked behind, fiercely alone.|$|R
60|$|His face got all grey {{instead of}} being red like it was {{and there was a}} fly <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> it up <b>to</b> his eye. The scrunch that was when they were {{screwing}} the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs.|$|R
6000|$|... “No use in staying here,” was Dave’s comment. “We’ll {{get there}} somehow. But {{keep out of}} sight, if you can. We don’t want them to {{discover}} us until the last minute.” All moved forward toward the hollow.

50|$|Many of the eccentricities of Paul W. Klipsch were {{captured}} by author Jim Shahin in a 1989 interview for American Way Magazine, who told of his taking notes during sermons {{so as to}} better take issue with exasperated ministers after the service. Parishioners even remember his <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> pews <b>to</b> get out of church. He also retells of an audio retailer’s recollection of Klipsch drilling a hole through {{the top of his}} Mercedes to install an altimeter.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is no {{time for}} sleep!" [...] exclaimed the cook, very loud. He had prayerfully {{divested}} himself of the last vestige of his humanity. He was a voice--a fleshless and sublime thing, as on that memorable night--the night when he went <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> the sea <b>to</b> make coffee for perishing sinners. [...] "This {{is no time}} for sleeping," [...] he repeated with exaltation. [...] "I can't sleep." ...|$|R

40|$|Individuals {{with certain}} types of central nervous system damage, such as stroke, have an {{asymmetric}} walking gait. Using a split-belt treadmill, where each leg walks at a different speed, {{has been shown to}} help rehabilitate walking impaired individuals, but there is one distinct drawback; the corrected gait does not transfer well <b>to</b> <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> ground. <b>To</b> increase the gait transference to another environment, we designed and built a passive shoe that admits a motion similar to that felt when walking on a split-belt treadmill. Our gait enhancing mobile shoe (GEMS) alters the wearer’s gait by causing one foot to move backward during the stance phase while <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> ground. No external power is required since the shoe mechanically converts the wearers downward and horizontal forces into a backward motion. This shoe would allow a patient <b>to</b> walk <b>over</b> ground while experiencing the same gait altering effects as felt on a split-belt treadmill, which should aid in transferring the corrected gait to walking in natural environments...|$|R

With its picturesque views, the lush, [...] "people's park" [...] {{at the foot of}} the Capitol complex includes a promenade and landscaped gardens, in addition to providing public space for rallies and special events.

50|$|The tree is well {{situated}} {{in an open}} space clearing. It is approached from State Highway 12 through the Waipoua Forest up to the car park, close {{to the site of}} the tree. From this point, a winding walk of about 20 minutes along a well-maintained track, surfaced with boardwalks, has marked signs leading directly to the Te Matua Ngahere. The boardwalks protect tree roots from being subjected to human feet. As the roots of the kauri tree are sensitive to frequent trampling by foot, it is advisable <b>to</b> avoid <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> the roots <b>to</b> ensure the long life of the trees.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And even if {{you hear}} cries and sounds, however alarming, you must on no account enter,' said the jogi, <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> a closet where lay the silken cord that was to {{strangle}} the princess.|$|E

60|$|The meal over, {{the three}} boys lost {{no time in}} <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> {{the other side of}} the city, where Abe Blower lived. They found the front windows of the house open and an elderly woman was {{sweeping}} off the front stoop with a broom.|$|E
5000|$|... ==History== As Radøy was {{historically}} divided amongst several municipalities, Sletta {{was a part}} of Lindås municipality until 1964. Since Sletta lies on {{a different}} side of Lurefjorden than the rest of Lindås, the easiest transport was by boat. It was even better than <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> the hills <b>to</b> Manger and the rest of Radøy. The people at Sletta actually felt more in common with the {{people on the other side}} of the fjord. As the car became an important travel method, almost all of Radøy was merged in 1964 and Manger became the hub, so Sletta and the surrounding area was transferred to the new municipality of Radøy.|$|R
50|$|The {{enemies of}} the game are called smoglings. They turn your flowers black, causing the flowers to wither at dusk. You defeat them by {{squirting}} with water them until they pop, spraying water and releasing a seed. You can prevent Smoglings from appearing by {{the holes in the}} ground that they appear out of until the holes shrink away to nothing.. Smoglings can also react to food items like candy if you give some to them. Smogglobs are giant versions of Smoglings and turn flowers into black flowers when they steps on them and into miasmo flowers when they release smoke. Miasmo flowers still wither at dusk, but you can change them back by squirting them or <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> them. <b>To</b> defeat a Smogglob, you need to knock it down with a vehicle and squirt at it until it pops. releasing several buds and spraying water {{in a manner similar to}} that of the Smoglings.|$|R
5|$|The Little Tern colony at Holkham, holding seven {{per cent}} of the British population, is cordoned off in the {{breeding}} season, with signs explaining why people are excluded from the area. The dune vegetation can be damaged by too many people <b>walking</b> <b>over</b> it, leading <b>to</b> blowout, the rapid wind erosion of the sand. Boardwalks and steps enable visitors to reach the beach on foot without harming the dunes, and horse riders and naturists are asked {{to stay on the}} beach and keep off the dunes. As the climate becomes warmer in the future, there is likely to be more tourism pressure on the coasts, but the effects of this may be mitigated by a move towards lower-impact activities like bathing.|$|R
