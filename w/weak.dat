5|$|In {{particle}} physics, the <b>weak</b> interaction (the <b>weak</b> {{force or}} <b>weak</b> nuclear force) is {{the mechanism of}} interaction between sub-atomic particles that causes radioactive decay and thus plays {{an essential role in}} nuclear fission. The theory of the <b>weak</b> interaction is sometimes called quantum flavourdynamics (QFD), in analogy with the terms quantum chromodynamics (QCD) dealing with the strong interaction and quantum electrodynamics (QED) dealing with the electromagnetic force. However, the term QFD is rarely used because the <b>weak</b> force is best understood in terms of electro-weak theory (EWT).|$|E
5|$|The <b>weak</b> {{interaction}} affects all the fermions of the Standard Model, {{as well as}} the Higgs boson; neutrinos interact through {{gravity and}} the <b>weak</b> interaction only, and neutrinos were the original reason for the name <b>weak</b> force. The <b>weak</b> interaction does not produce bound states (nor does it involve binding energy) – something that gravity does on an astronomical scale, that the electromagnetic force does at the atomic level, and that the strong nuclear force does inside nuclei.|$|E
5|$|A pH {{indicator}} is a <b>weak</b> acid or <b>weak</b> {{base that}} changes colour {{in the transition}} pH range, which is approximately pKa±1. The design of a universal indicator requires a mixture of indicators whose adjacent pKa values differ by about two, so that their transition pH ranges just overlap.|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we {{investigate}} {{the relationships between the}} classical notions of <b>weakest</b> precondition and <b>weakest</b> liberal precondition, and provide several results, namely that in general, <b>weakest</b> liberal precondition is neither stronger nor <b>weaker</b> than <b>weakest</b> precondition, however, given a deterministic and terminating sequential while program and a postcondition, they are equivalent. Hence, in such situation, it does not matter which definition is used...|$|R

5|$|Although the <b>weak</b> {{interaction}} was once described by Fermi's theory, {{the discovery of}} parity violation and renormalization theory suggested that a new approach was needed. In 1957, Robert Marshak and George Sudarshan and, somewhat later, Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann proposed a V−A (vector minus axial vector or left-handed) Lagrangian for <b>weak</b> interactions. In this theory, the <b>weak</b> interaction acts only on left-handed particles (and right-handed antiparticles). Since the mirror reflection of a left-handed particle is right-handed, this explains the maximal violation of parity. Interestingly, the V−A theory was developed before {{the discovery of the}} Z boson, so it did not include the right-handed fields that enter in the neutral current interaction.|$|E
5|$|Amino acids {{are usually}} {{classified}} by {{the properties of}} their side chain into four groups. The side chain can make an amino acid a <b>weak</b> acid or a <b>weak</b> base, and a hydrophile if the side chain is polar or a hydrophobe if it is nonpolar. The chemical structures of the 22 standard amino acids, along with their chemical properties, are described more fully in the article on these proteinogenic amino acids.|$|E

5|$|Cooperativity is {{observed}} when two synapses are activated by <b>weak</b> stimuli incapable of inducing LTP when stimulated individually. But upon simultaneous <b>weak</b> stimulation, both synapses undergo LTP in a cooperative fashion. Synaptic tagging {{does not explain}} how multiple <b>weak</b> stimuli can result in a collective stimulus sufficient to induce LTP (this is explained by the postsynaptic summation of EPSPs described previously). Rather, synaptic tagging explains the ability of weakly stimulated synapses, none of which are capable of independently generating LTP, to receive the products of protein synthesis initiated collectively. As before, this may be accomplished through the synthesis of a local synaptic tag following <b>weak</b> synaptic stimulation.|$|E

5|$|Food webs exhibit {{principles}} of ecological emergence through {{the nature of}} trophic relationships: some species have many <b>weak</b> feeding links (e.g., omnivores) while some are more specialized with fewer stronger feeding links (e.g., primary predators). Theoretical and empirical studies identify non-random emergent patterns of few strong and many <b>weak</b> linkages that explain how ecological communities remain stable over time. Food webs are composed of subgroups where members in a community are linked by strong interactions, and the <b>weak</b> interactions occur between these subgroups. This increases food web stability. Step by step lines or relations are drawn until a web of life is illustrated.|$|E

5|$|Having {{electric}} charge, mass, color charge, and flavor, quarks are {{the only}} known elementary particles that engage in all four fundamental interactions of contemporary physics: electromagnetism, gravitation, strong interaction, and <b>weak</b> interaction. Gravitation is too <b>weak</b> to be relevant to individual particle interactions except at extremes of energy (Planck energy) and distance scales (Planck distance). However, since no successful quantum theory of gravity exists, gravitation is not described by the Standard Model.|$|E

5|$|In an aerotow a powered {{aircraft}} {{is attached}} to a glider with a tow rope. Single-engined light aircraft or motor gliders are commonly used. The tow-plane takes the glider to the height and location requested by the pilot where the glider pilot releases the tow-rope. A <b>weak</b> link is often fitted to the rope to ensure that any sudden loads do not damage the airframe of the tow-plane or the glider. Under extreme loads the <b>weak</b> link will fail before any part of the glider or plane fails. There is a remote chance that the <b>weak</b> link might break at low altitude, and so pilots plan for this eventuality before launching.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of the <b>weak</b> interaction, fermions can {{exchange}} three distinct types of force carriers known as the W+, W−, and Z bosons. The mass of each of these bosons is far greater than the mass of a proton or neutron, which is consistent with the short range of the <b>weak</b> force. The force is in fact termed <b>weak</b> because its field strength over a given distance is typically several orders of magnitude less than that of the strong nuclear force or electromagnetic force.|$|E

Other variations included breaking a lift into two syllables, the first short but stressed, the second <b>weak,</b> with for instance 'vĕssel' in place of 'boat'.|$|E
