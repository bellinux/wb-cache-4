2500|$|In this deposition, Peak {{told the}} County Attorney {{that he wanted}} to [...] "get out of this whole thing." [...] He cannot {{remember}} details of his story, such as the name of a woman who drove him from NCCF headquarters to David Rice's house to pick up the suitcase bomb. The County Attorney provided him Norma Aufrecht's name. Peak repeatedly said that Edward Poindexter got a box of dynamite and a suitcase out of David Rice's basement. At the trial, he would change his testimony to implicate another NCCF member, when his new testimony was that Raleigh House drove Duane with a suitcase full of dynamite to David Rice's house, Edward Poindexter took three sticks to make the bomb and put the remaining sticks in a box, which he took into the basement. Peak also claimed that he put the suitcase {{in the middle of the}} room standing up, and that someone else must have laid it down in the doorway and armed it to explode. He refused to say that he attached the bomb to the floor, which annoyed Art O'Leary who told him on page 25, [...] "As a practical matter, it doesn't make any difference <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> concerning you at all." [...] At other points in the deposition, Peak said that police officers told him Panthers were coming from out of town to eliminate him. He specifically said that Foxall told him he was the last person seen carrying a suitcase at 28th and Ohio that night.|$|E

60|$|But in this passage, as {{throughout}} most of Plato's teaching, there is an identification of the good with the truly real, which became embodied in the philosophical tradition, and is still largely operative in our own day. In thus allowing a legislative function to the good, Plato produced a divorce between philosophy and science, from which, in my opinion, both have suffered ever since and are still suffering. The man of science, whatever his hopes may be, must lay them aside while he studies nature; and the philosopher, {{if he is to}} achieve truth, must do the same. Ethical considerations can only legitimately appear when the truth has been ascertained: they can and should appear as determining our feeling towards the truth, and our manner of ordering our lives in view of the truth, but not as themselves dictating <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> to be.|$|E

"Mrs. Vostrand, whose {{letter to}} me I {{will leave you}} to answer by [...] showing her this, {{or in any other}} manner you choose, tells me you do [...] not want me to spare <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> {{concerning}} you.

6000|$|There was {{something}} so bare, so spiritually poverty-stricken, in these confessions and questions, that Halleck found {{nothing to say}} to them. He was troubled, moreover, as to <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> in his own mind. He answered, with a sort of mechanical adhesion to the teachings of his youth, [...] "I should be a recreant not to think so. But I'm not sure that I know what you mean by belonging to some church," [...] he added. [...] "I suppose you would want to believe in the creed of the church, whichever it was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 3. You must, therefore, {{commence}} {{with the}} philosophic {{idea of the}} thing, {{the true nature of}} which you wish to find out and manifest. You must carry your rule ready made, if you wish to measure aright. If you ask me how I can know that this idea--my own invention--is the truth, by which the phenomena of history are to be explained, I answer, in the same way exactly that you know that your eyes were made to see with; and that is, because you do see with them. If I propose to you an idea or self-realizing theory of the constitution, which shall manifest itself as in existence from the earliest times to the present,--which shall comprehend within it all the facts which history has preserved, and shall give them a meaning as interchangeably causals or effects;--if I show you that such an event or reign was an obliquity to the right hand, and how produced, and such other event or reign a deviation to the left, and whence originating,--that the growth was stopped here, accelerated there,--that such a tendency is, and always has been, corroborative, and such other tendency destructive, of the main progress of the idea towards realization;--if this idea, not only like a kaleidoscope, shall reduce all the miscellaneous fragments into order, but shall also minister strength, and knowledge, and light to the true patriot and statesmen for working out the bright thought, and bringing the glorious embryo to a perfect birth;--then, I think, I have a right to say that the idea which led to this is not only true, but the truth, the only truth. To set up for a statesman upon historical knowledge only, is as about as wise as to set up for a musician by the purchase of some score flutes, fiddles, and horns. In order to make music, you must know how to play; in order to make your facts speak truth, you must know <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> which ought to be proved,--the ideal truth,--the truth which was consciously or unconsciously, strongly or weakly, wisely or blindly, intended at all times.[1] ...|$|E
60|$|As its greatness {{depends on}} the sum of truth, and this sum of truth can always be {{increased}} by delicacy of handling, it follows that all great art must have this delicacy to the utmost possible degree. This rule is infallible and inflexible. All coarse work is the sign of low art. Only, {{it is to be}} remembered, that coarseness must be estimated by the distance from the eye; it being necessary to consult this distance, when great, by laying on touches which appear coarse when seen near; but which, so far from being coarse, are, in reality, more delicate in a master's work than the finest close handling, for they involve a calculation of result, and are laid on with a subtlety of sense precisely correspondent to that with which a good archer draws his bow; the spectator seeing in the action nothing but the strain of the strong arm, while there is, in reality, in the finger and eye, an ineffably delicate estimate of distance, and touch on the arrow plume. And, indeed, this delicacy is generally quite perceptible to those who know <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is,</b> for strokes by Tintoret or Paul Veronese, which were done in an instant, and look to an ignorant spectator merely like a violent dash of loaded color, (and are, as such, imitated by blundering artists,) are, in fact, modulated by the brush and finger to that degree of delicacy that no single grain of the color could be taken from the touch without injury; and little golden particles of it, not the size of a gnat's head, have important share and function in the balances of light in a picture perhaps fifty feet long. Nearly every other rule applicable to art has some exception but this. This has absolutely none. All great art is delicate art, and all coarse art is bad art. Nay, even to a certain extent, all bold art is bad art; for boldness is not the proper word to apply to the courage and swiftness of a great master, based on knowledge, and coupled with fear and love. There is as much difference between the boldness of the true and the false masters, as there is between the courage of a pure woman and the shamelessness of a lost one.|$|E

Nowadays, there are so many things assaulting you at the same time, that you just have to choose.|$|E

They made these three marks exactly in a line with each other, expecting that, if the glacier moved, the rock in the centre of it would be carried forward, and the three marks would be no longer in a line.|$|R

He Mai knew <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was,</b> and, not able to bear this humiliation, considered deposing Emperor Qianfei and making his brother Liu Zixun the Prince of Jin'an emperor.

5000|$|Jonathan IX {{arrived on}} campus in July 1991, and began his stay with Alpha Phi Omega. However before his debut {{to the student}} body, the {{fraternity}} stated the husky was not Jonathan IX but actually Jonathan X. [...] Alpha Phi Omega's theory was that two huskies served as Jonathan VIII and the mascot's name needed to reflect this. There are no public records to dispute or verify this claim {{but it is the}} claim given by the University in publications and on tours. [...] Another theory on campus states that students of Clubhouse 29 found a stray pup on the streets and took him in. After being informed it was Jonathan IX they refused to give the pup back to Alpha Phi Omega. The fraternity mobilized and was able to find another husky in time, Jonathan X.Even though it is unclear <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> surrounding Jonathan X, he served the university dutifully. Jonathan X is notable for having one blue eye and one brown eye, known as Heterochromia iridum. [...] Tragically Jonathan X was struck by a vehicle and died in 1995.|$|E
50|$|Abdullah Badruddin {{was born}} in the era of the 47th Da'i al-Mutlaq and his uncle Abdul Qadir Najmuddin. A time when the enemies of the Dawoodi Bohra {{community}} hatched a conspiracy stating that nas has not been conferred over Abdul Qadir Najmuddin by the 46th Da'i al-Mutlaq Mohammed Badruddin. This created a lot of chaos and confusion among members of the community. To this allegation his uncle never said anything but just stated that the fifth Da'i al-Mutlaq from him will answer his enemies. His uncle travelled extensively amongst the colonies {{of the members of the}} Dawoodi Bohra community to teach them, to educate them and also gave the permission to all learned members of the Dawoodi Bohra community to teach the common members as to <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is.</b> He supported his uncle, so did other learned members of the community. Together they were able to bring back many members who had gone astray due to claims by enemies and also increased the faith of those members who stood by his uncle. But all these activities caused a great drain on the funds of the Dawoodi Bohra sect and causing the sect to become more indebted.|$|E

6000|$|I {{glanced at}} the Altrurian, sitting {{attentive}} and silent, and a sudden misgiving crossed my mind concerning him.

It was a fantastic conception, but I thought it was one that I might employ {{in some sort of}} purely romantic design, and I was professionally grateful for it. I said, with a humorous gayety: [...] "Yes, we all seem to have been compelled to be much more honest than we like; and if Mr. Homos is going to write an account of his travels when he gets home, he can't accuse us of hypocrisy, at any rate. And I always used to think it was one of our virtues! What with Mr. Camp, here, and my friend the banker at the hotel, I don't think he'll have much reason to complain even of our reticence." ...|$|R

50|$|I {{was riding}} my horse behind Ali ibn Abi Talib. And {{while he was}} riding his horse and I am behind him, I called out to him, 'Whats the truth?' Imam Ali said 'Sorry'.

I (Kumayl) said 'I don't understand, but continue telling me what is the truth.' He said 'It's the rendering of the veils by the triumph of mystery.' I said 'Tell me more.' He said 'It is the divine attraction, but through the apprehension of the known.' I said 'Tell me more.'

5000|$|Wired Magazine {{came out}} with a big exposé of [...] "the new atheists". I was interviewed for it—and yet I think I was {{included}} as a sidebar but not as a main feature and I think the main reason they did that was because they noticed that I wasn't that happy billing myself as an atheist. To me it just doesn't say that much; it doesn't say much about you. Instead I bill myself as a naturalist, which I think says a lot more. Because a naturalist is someone who... first of all—they study natural science, and they have a hopeful message—I think—to send to the world, which is... we can agree on <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is...</b> {{and it has to be}} through experimentation, verification, and new discoveries, followed by more verification. So... if we can agree on those terms, we can agree that the truth changes, based on new discoveries, and the structure of science is such that you can never be so sure of something, because a new discovery can rework the framework—it can reconstruct the framework of your science and you have to look at the world differently. That makes it a very dynamic and exciting place to be. And if you say [...] "you're an atheist", it's not really saying much about how you came to that conclusion. But if you say [...] "you're a naturalist", I think it says something. You've reached that point because you've studied science, because you believe there's a fundamental way of looking at the world that is part of a long tradition. And so, I prefer naturalist.

60|$|Katharine {{wished to}} comfort her mother, but it was {{difficult}} to do this satisfactorily when the facts themselves were so much of a legend. The house in Russell Square, for example, with its noble rooms, and the magnolia-tree in the garden, and the sweet-voiced piano, and the sound of feet coming down the corridors, and other properties of size and romance--had they any existence? Yet why should Mrs. Alardyce live all alone in this gigantic mansion, and, if she did not live alone, with whom did she live? For its own sake, Katharine rather liked this tragic story, and would have been glad to hear the details of it, and {{to have been able to}} discuss them frankly. But this it became less and less possible to do, for though Mrs. Hilbery was constantly reverting to the story, it was always in this tentative and restless fashion, as though by a touch here and there she could set things straight which had been crooked these sixty years.
