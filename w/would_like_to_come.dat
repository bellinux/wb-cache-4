5|$|In an {{interview}} with the San Francisco Chronicle, Damon revealed that he was asked to appear on the show by Sean Hayes, a friend of Damon's and the actor that plays Jack on Will & Grace. Damon enjoyed the idea for the episode and agreed to appear on the show. He commented that it was easy for him to get into character because he had previously played a gay character in the film The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999). Following his appearance, Damon told the Chicago Sun-Times in June 2002 that he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back and guest star.|$|E

500|$|When {{staff at}} the Rainbow told him of Corcoran's {{disappearance}} on 13 November, Smith telephoned the police station at Castle Vale saying that he wished to give a statement. Significantly, his call came at 4:00pm, before the body found in Worcestershire had been positively identified as Corcoran's, and within an hour Smith had presented himself at Castle Vale. Detective Constable Ruth Wilkins later recalled Smith's phone call: [...] "He said he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{to the police station}} to help with the inquiry and that he had seen [...] on Saturday night leave the pub with an unknown man. He insisted he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> over to the police station. He said he had been asked to contact the police by someone else and gave his mobile number." ...|$|E
500|$|Welles {{described}} his chance encounter with Hearst {{in an elevator}} at the Fairmont Hotel on the night Citizen Kane opened in San Francisco. Hearst and Welles's father were acquaintances, so Welles introduced himself and asked Hearst if he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to the opening. Hearst did not respond. [...] "As he was getting off at his floor, I said, 'Charles Foster Kane would have accepted.' No reply", recalled Welles. [...] "And Kane would have you know. That was his style—just as he finished Jed Leland's bad review of Susan as an opera singer." ...|$|E
500|$|In the stanza that follows, Helgi {{asks the}} valkyries (who {{he refers to}} as [...] "southern goddesses") if they <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> home with the warriors when night falls (all the while arrows were flying). The battle over, the valkyrie Sigrún ("victory-rune"), informs him from her horse that her father Högni has betrothed her to Höðbroddr, the son of king Granmar of the Hniflung clan, who Sigrún deems unworthy. Helgi assembles an immense host to ride to wage battle at Frekastein against the Hniflung clan to assist Sigrún in her plight to avoid her betrothment. Later in the poem, the hero Sinfjötli flyts with Guðmundr. Sinfjötli accuses Guðmundr of having once been female, and gibes that Guðmundr was [...] "a witch, horrible, unnatural, among Odin's valkyries", adding that all of the einherjar [...] "had to fight, headstrong woman, on your account". Further in the poem, the phrase [...] "the valkyrie's airy sea" [...] is used for [...] "mist".|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{the night}} club. We {{take it in}} turns. Thursday is my night. <b>Would</b> you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come?</b> You {{see a lot of}} types. It's only round the corner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{ought to}} be lonely enough to suit anybody," [...] {{observed}} Henshaw. He turned to Roger. [...] "How <b>would</b> you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out here some dark night all alone?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. My {{house is}} not ten steps away, and I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> you <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and have a talk and a pipe, and let me {{introduce}} my wife." ...|$|R

"The {{following}} {{day after the}} Alexandra Palace gig (where Steve walked off), I was back home and I {{got a call from}} Ronnie Lane who said, 'Me, Kenney and Mac <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> round and see you.' I thought, Hello, what's all this about? Anyway, they all came round to my horrible little flat in Earls Court and asked me to join the Small Faces. All I could say was it's a bit late now. Why couldn't you have asked me while we were in Paris? We'd all be in the same band together and Steve wouldn't have left." [...] – Peter Frampton.|$|E
2500|$|In mid-June 2005, a {{software}} patch {{for the game}} dubbed the [...] "Hot Coffee mod" [...] was released by Patrick Wildenborg (under the Internet alias [...] "PatrickW"), a 38-year-old modder from the Netherlands. The name [...] "Hot Coffee" [...] refers {{to the way the}} released game alludes to the unseen sex scenes. In the unmodified game, the player takes his girlfriend to her front door and she asks him if he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in for [...] "some coffee". He agrees, and the camera stays outside, swaying back and forth a bit, while moaning sounds are heard. After installing the patch, users can enter the main character's girlfriends' houses and engage in a crudely rendered, fully clothed or nude sexual intercourse mini-game. The fallout from the controversy resulted in a public response from high-ranking politicians in the United States and elsewhere and resulted in the game's recall and re-release.|$|E

6000|$|... "Of course, I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> you <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> dear," [...] {{explains}} {{the first in}} a resigned tone. [...] "I thought perhaps you were only coming to please me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I have, Guy," [...] she answered, [...] "but I am just as {{pleased to}} see you. <b>Would</b> you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and be {{introduced}} to my uncle and guardian?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Alas," [...] said Dick, [...] "I can {{not tell}} you anything. But of one thing I feel sure, and that is that he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> her <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps Roger <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> along," [...] {{continued}} Dave. [...] "I {{was going}} out for a row, and Phil said he would go, too," [...] he explained.|$|E

6000|$|I {{laughed at}} the warning, though I had {{occasion}} to remember it, and looking for Alice I said, [...] "I am driving in to church to-night. <b>Would</b> you <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> with me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Show {{him into}} my study." [...] Then {{he turned to}} us. [...] "My mother's lawyer," [...] he explained. And in a lower voice: [...] "He is also Coroner--you understand. Perhaps you <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> with me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will send}} him {{as soon as}} he comes," [...] said Mrs. Morrell, giving Matt that glance of liking which no good woman could withhold. [...] "Unless," [...] she added, [...] "you <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in and wait for him." ...|$|E

Klara won't come to our church, of course, but she <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to the ball presently, and to-morrow to our wedding feast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, I quite long {{to renew}} our acquaintance," [...] Mr. Pynsent said, gallantly, {{and with a}} look which fairly said, [...] "It is you that I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and see"--to which look and speech Miss Laura vouchsafed a smile, and made a little bow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Trade is slack," [...] Wolf resumed. [...] "The Spanish merchants {{see they}} can't ship much produce and are cutting their orders.
