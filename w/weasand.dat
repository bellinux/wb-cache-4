"Ay, Will," [...] {{answered}} Ganlesse carelessly; [...] "I think I {{have seen}} thee wave thy whinyard at {{the throat of}} a Hogan-Mogan--a Netherlandish <b>weasand,</b> which expanded only on thy natural and mortal objects of aversion,--Dutch cheese, rye-bread, pickled herring, onion, and Geneva." ...|$|E

6000|$|There was a laugh {{among the}} men at the boy's sturdy self-assertion, and then the man named Dikon said: [...] "Come along, lad. I will take you to Dame Vernon at once.

"Bide a wee, Maister Rupert Razorbill," [...] he said lightly, {{lowering}} his sword, [...] "before we slit ane anither's <b>weasands.</b> I'm no claimin' any descent frae kings, and I'm no acceptin' any auld wife's clavers against my women forbears, as ye are!

6000|$|The {{heart of}} the Oeil-de-Boeuf glows into hope; into daring, which is premature. Rallied Maids of Honour, waited on by Abbes, sew 'white cockades;' {{distribute}} them, with words, with glances, to epauletted youths; who in return, may kiss, not without fervour, the fair sewing fingers. Captains of horse and foot go swashing with 'enormous white cockades;' nay one Versailles National Captain had mounted the like, so witching were the words and glances; and laid aside his tricolor! Well may Major Lecointre shake {{his head with a}} look of severity; and speak audible resentful words. But now a swashbuckler, with enormous white cockade, overhearing the Major, invites him insolently, once and then again elsewhere, to recant; and failing that, to duel. Which latter feat Major Lecointre declares that he will not perform, not at least by any known laws of fence; that he nevertheless will, according to mere law of Nature, by dirk and blade, 'exterminate' any 'vile gladiator,' who may insult him or the Nation;--whereupon (for the Major is actually drawing his implement) 'they are parted,' and no <b>weasands</b> slit.

"Eh, Frank Levitt," [...] {{said this}} new-comer, who entered with a hop, step, and jump, which at once {{conveyed}} {{her from the}} door into the centre of the party, [...] "were ye killing our mother? or were ye cutting the grunter's <b>weasand</b> that Tam brought in this morning? or have ye been reading your prayers backward, to bring up my auld acquaintance the deil amang ye?" ...|$|E

60|$|As {{he turned}} down Norfolk Street, he thought of all this, as the gambler, sitting with his razor before him with which he intends to cut his throat, may be {{supposed}} {{to think of the}} stakes which he has failed to win, and the fortune he has failed to make.

60|$|Since that dreadful {{day when}} Baron Henry {{had come to}} his cell, only two souls had visited Otto. One was the fellow who had come with the Baron that time; his name, Otto found, was Casper. He brought the boy his rude meals of bread and meat and water. The other visitor was the leech or doctor, a thin, <b>weasand</b> little man, with a kindly, {{wrinkled}} face and a gossiping tongue, who, besides binding wounds, bleeding, and leeching, and administering his simple remedies {{to those who were}} taken sick in the castle, acted as the Baron's barber.|$|E

"It {{were too}} much honour for the like of me," [...] said Dalgetty; [...] "your lordship shall remain under charge of mine honest friend Ranald MacEagh; therefore, prithee let me drag you {{within reach of}} his chain.--Honest Ranald, you see how matters stand with us. I shall find the means, I doubt not, of setting you at freedom.

6000|$|One morning Captain Blackbeard {{finds that}} his stock of {{medicine}} is low. [...] "Tut!" [...] says he, [...] "we'll turn no hair gray for that." [...] So up {{he calls the}} bold Captain Richards, the commander of his consort the Revenge sloop, and bids him take Mr. Marks (one of his prisoners), and go up to Charleston and get the medicine. There was no task that suited our Captain Richards better than that. Up to the town he rowed, as bold as brass. [...] "Look ye," [...] says he to the governor, rolling his quid of tobacco from one cheek to another--"look ye, we're after this and that, and if we don't get it, why, I'll tell you plain, we'll burn them bloody crafts of yours that we've took over yonder, and cut the <b>weasand</b> of every clodpoll aboard of 'em." ...|$|E
6000|$|So saying, {{he thrust}} the knife back again into its sheath, then stooping {{and picking up}} the other, he flung him across his {{shoulder}} like a sack, and running down the steps as lightly as though his load was nothing at all, he carried his burden to the arched doorway whence he had come a little while before. There, having first stripped his prisoner of all his weapons, Hans sat the man up in {{the angle of the}} wall. [...] "So, brother;" [...] said he, [...] "now we can talk with more ease than we could up yonder. I will tell thee frankly why I am here; it is to find where the young Baron Otto of Drachenhausen is kept. If thou canst tell me, well and good; if not, I must e'en cut thy <b>weasand</b> and find me one who knoweth more. Now, canst thou tell me what I would learn, brother?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why," [...] resumed MacGregor, [...] "ye ken weel eneugh {{that women}} and gear are {{at the bottom of}} a' the {{mischief}} in this warld. I hae been misdoubting your cousin Rashleigh since ever he saw that he wasna to get Die Vernon for his marrow, and I think he took grudge at his Excellency mainly on that account. But then came the splore about the surrendering your papers--and we hae now gude evidence, that, sae soon as he was compelled to yield them up, he rade post to Stirling, and tauld the Government all and mair than all, that was gaun doucely on amang us hill-folk; and, doubtless, that was the way that the country was laid to take his Excellency and the leddy, and to make sic an unexpected raid on me. And I hae as little doubt that the poor deevil Morris, whom he could gar believe onything, was egged on by him, and some of the Lowland gentry, to trepan me in the gate he tried to do. But if Rashleigh Osbaldistone were baith the last and best of his name, and granting that he and I ever forgather again, the fiend go down my <b>weasand</b> with a bare blade at his belt, if we part before my dirk and his best blude are weel acquainted thegither!" ...|$|E
6000|$|To the Thinkers of this nation, however, {{of which}} class it is firmly {{believed}} there are individuals yet extant, we can safely recommend the Work: nay, who knows {{but among the}} fashionable ranks too, if it be true, as Teufelsdrockh maintains, that [...] "within the most starched cravat there passes a windpipe and <b>weasand,</b> and under the thickliest embroidered waistcoat beats a heart,"--the force of that rapt earnestness may be felt, and here and there an arrow of the soul pierce through? In our wild Seer, shaggy, unkempt, like a Baptist living on locusts and wild honey, there is an untutored energy, a silent, as it were unconscious, strength, which, except in the higher walks of Literature, must be rare. Many a deep glance, and often with unspeakable precision, has he cast into mysterious Nature, and the still more mysterious Life of Man. Wonderful it is with what cutting words, now and then, he severs asunder the confusion; sheers down, were it furlongs deep; into the true centre of the matter; and there not only hits {{the nail on the}} head, but with crushing force smites it home, and buries it.--On the other hand, let us be free to admit, he is the most unequal writer breathing. Often after some such feat, he will play truant for long pages, and go dawdling and dreaming, and mumbling and maundering the merest commonplaces, as if he were asleep with eyes open, which indeed he is.|$|E
6000|$|Amongst our recreant Shaykhs I {{must not}} include Furayj bin RafÃ­'a el-HuwaytÃ­, {{a man of}} whom any tribe might be proud, and a living proof that the Bedawi may still be a true gentleman. A short figure, meagre of course, as becomes the denizen of the Desert, but [...] "hard as nails," [...] he has {{straight}} comely features, a clean dark skin, and a comparatively full beard, already, like his hair, waxing white, although he cannot be forty-five. A bullet in the back, and both hands distorted by sabre-cuts, attempts at assassination due to his own kin, do not prevent his using sword, gun, and pistol. He is the 'AgÃ­d of the tribe, the African [...] "Captain of War;" [...] {{as opposed to the}} civil authority, the Shayhk, and to the judicial, the KÃ¡zi. At first it is somewhat startling to hear him prescribe a slit <b>weasand</b> as a cure for lying; yet he seems to be known, loved, and respected by all around him, including his hereditary foes, the Ma'Ã¡zah. He is the only Bedawi in camp who prays. Naturally he is a genealogist, rich in local lore. He counteracts all the intrigues by which that rat-faced little rascal, Shaykh Hasan el-'Ukbi, tries to breed mischief between friends. He is a walking map; {{it would be easy to}} draw up a rude plan of the country from his information. He does not know hours and miles, but he can tell to a nicety the comparative length of a march; and, when ignorant, he has the courage to say M'adri, [...] "don't know." [...] He never asked me for anything, nor told a lie, nor even hid a water-hole. Willing and ready to undertake the longest march, the hardest work, his word is HÃ¡zir--"I'm here"--and he will even walk to mount a tired man. Seated upon his loud-voiced little Hijn,[EN#89] remarkable because it is of the noble BishÃ¡ri strain, bred between the Nile and the Red Sea, he is ever the guide in chief. At last it ends with NÃ¡di Shaykh Furayj!--"Call Shaykh Furayj"--when anything is to be done, to be explained, to be discovered. I would willingly have recommended him for the chieftainship of his tribe, but he is not wealthy; he wisely prefers to see the dignity in the hands of his cousin 'AlayÃ¡n, who, by-the-by, is helpless without him. He remained with us to the end: he seemed to take a pride in accompanying the expedition by sea to El-HaurÃ¡, and by land to the Wady Hamz, far beyond the limits of his tribe. When derided for mounting a pair of Government [...] "bluchers," [...] tied over bare feet, with bits of glaring tassel-string from his camel-saddle, he quoted the proverb, [...] "Whoso liveth with a people forty days becomes of them." [...] We parted after the most friendly adieu, or rather au revoir, and he was delighted with some small gifts of useful weapons:--I wonder whether Shaykh Furayj will prove [...] "milk," [...] to use Sir Walter Scott's phrase, [...] "which can stand more than one skimming." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{was concerned with}} the up-grading of: (i) connective tissue material {{in the form of}} beef membrane, pig rind and turkey skin; (ii) muscle material from low-value cuts and from offals such as beef heart; (iii) heart muscle, by extrusion processing; (i) An emulsified material from beef membrane and beef replaced up to 5 % of lean meat in corn beef and up to 10 % in beefburgers without impairing cooked yield and eating quality. A collagen emulsion paste (CEP) from pig rind replaced up to 5 % of lean meat in ham prepared from diced meat, and between 2 and 5 % in ham prepared from whole muscles without reduction in cooked yield, texture, appearance and eating quality. Turkey skin was minced, chopped and incorporated at 10, 15 and 20 % levels in a mix with turkey leg meat, which was used to make battered and breaded re-formed steaklets. Steaks containing up to 20 % of emulsified skin were similar to control samples in flavour, juiciness and overall acceptability. An antioxidant may be required to prevent rancidity during frozen storage. (ii) Yields of surimi-like material, prepared by water-extraction, sieving and centrifuging, were 16 % from lean of topside of beef (used as control for comparison), 39 % from beef heart, 17 % from pork mechanically recovered meat, 11 % from beef <b>weasand</b> and less than 5 % from beef cheek meat. The beef heart surimi was studied for its gelation properties and for its performance as an ingredient replacing lean meat in frankfurters and in beefburgers at levels between 3 and 15 %. In frankfurters the addition of the surimi reduced cook loss and increased tenderness. For overall eating quality the frankfurters with 7 or 10 % of surimi were preferable, and those with 15 % equal, to those with none. In beefburgers cook loss was decreased from 32 to 25 % by the addition of 15 % surimi. Other results were similar to those for frankfurters, showing that the surimi could be added at 10 to 15 % level without impairing texture or flavour. (iii) Cold extrusion processing of beef heart muscle with the aim of increasing its functionality showed that gelation properties of the material were not improved by extrusion compared to bowl chopping; moreover, the extruded product had a strong odour and dark colour.
