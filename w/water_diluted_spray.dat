40|$|Recent {{advances}} concerning {{analysis of}} sprays and drop/turbulence interactions are reviewed. Consideration {{is given to}} <b>dilute</b> <b>sprays</b> and related <b>dilute</b> dispersed flows, which contain well-defined dispersed-phase elements (e. g. spherical drops) and have dispersed-phase volume fractions less than 1 %; and to the near-injector, dense spray region, having irregularly-shaped liquid elements and relatively-high liquid fractions. Early analysis of <b>dilute</b> <b>sprays</b> and other dispersed flows assumed either locally-homogeneous flow (LHF), implying infinitely-fast interphase transport rates, or deterministic separated flow (DSF) where finite interphase transport rates are considered, but interactions between dispersed-phase elements and turbulence are ignored. These limits are useful in some instances; however, recent evidence shows that both methods are deficient for quantitative estimates {{of the structure of}} most practical dispersed flows, including sprays. As a result, stochastic separated flow (SSF) methods have been developed, which treat both finite interphase transport rates and dispersed phase (drop) /turbulence interactions using random-walk computations for the dispersed phase. Evaluation of SSF methods for particle-laden jets; nonevaporating, evaporating and combusting sprays; and noncondensing and condensing bubbly jets has been encouraging, suggesting capabilities of current SSF methods to treat a variety of interphase processes. However, current methods are relatively ad hoc and many fundamental problems must still be resolved for dilute flows, e. g. effects of anisotropic turbulence, modification of continuous-phase turbulence properties by the dispersed phase (turbulence modulation), effects of turbulence on interphase transport rates, and drop shattering, among others. Dense sprays have received less attention and are poorly understood due to substantial theoretical and experimental difficulties, e. g. the idealization of spherical drops is not realistic, effects of liquid breakup and collisions are difficult to describe, spatial resolution is limited and the flow is opaque to optical diagnostics which have been helpful for studies of <b>dilute</b> <b>sprays.</b> Limited progress thus far, however, suggests that LHF analysis may provide a useful first-approximation of the structure and mixing properties of dense sprays near pressure-atomizing injectors. Since dense-spray processes fix initial conditions needed to rationally analyze <b>dilute</b> <b>sprays,</b> more research is this area is clearly warranted...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} first {{measurements}} of temperature in turbulent <b>dilute</b> <b>spray</b> flames of acetone using non-linear excitation regime two-line atomic fluorescence (NTLAF), a technique {{well suited for}} temperature measurements in flames laden with particles and droplets. The NTLAF technique has previously been successful at measuring temperature in turbulent non-premixed flames of gaseous fuels {{in the presence of}} soot. Temperature is extracted from the fluorescence ratio collected of two lines of indium generated from indium chloride which is seeded into the flow. The non-linear excitation regime is exploited to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the measurements. In the current arrangement, indium chloride is seeded with the acetone fuel and laminar premixed flames of methane are used for calibration. The preliminary results are promising and indicate that the presence of droplets does not affect the signal, making NTLAF particularly well-suited to measure temperature in turbulent, <b>dilute</b> <b>spray</b> flames.

40|$|The {{effects of}} foliar {{application}} of marine algae extract (RIC- 1) {{on the growth}} and development of roots and shoots in satsuma mandarin were studied under plastic house conditions. The 500 times <b>diluted</b> <b>sprays</b> of this extract enhanced the formation of fibrous roots and at higher concentration (300 times diluted), root rotting occurred. While at lower concentration (1000 times diluted), the roots became comparatively thicker. The formation of new branches and their lengths were higher in all treated trees with maximum value at 500 times <b>diluted</b> <b>spray</b> compared to those of control. The number of leaves and their size in terms of length and width were significantly higher in the treated trees having the maximum output under 500 times diluted treatment. Light microscopic observation revealed the accumulation of numerous starch grains in the mesophyll cells of leaves in the treated trees. The starch grain number/cell increased along the increased concentration of RIC- 1 sprays from 1000 times diluted to 300 times diluted. The width of mesophyll cell layer also similarly increased in RIC- 1 treated leaves.

40|$|The {{secondary}} atomization {{characteristics of}} <b>dilute</b> <b>spray</b> jets of mineral turpentine with {{varying levels of}} turbu-lence are investigated using phase Doppler anemometry (PDA). The choice of mineral turpentine as the injected liquid ensures no evaporation at room temperature and a <b>dilute</b> <b>spray</b> is utilized to avoid droplet-droplet inter-actions. The spray is formed upstream of a pipe and is carried with air to the jet exit plane. The inﬂuence of turbulence on secondary atomization is studied in this paper via presentation of the Sauter mean diameter (SMD), droplet diameter probability density functions (PDFs), and scatter plots of the droplet Weber (Wed) vs. Ohnesorge (Ohd) number. A range of Reynolds numbers from ∼ 12, 000 - 37, 000 are tested with tube lengths varying from 4. 7 to 43 jet diameters. The focus is on data from measurements taken at the tube exit planes where the effects of dispersion are minimal. All of the aforementioned simpliﬁcations allow for the authors to attribute changes in droplet diameter predominantly to secondary atomization. Scatter plots of the droplet Wed vs. Ohd reveal that in the investigated geometry, Wed << 10 for Ohd < 0. 1 due to the low droplet slip velocity, indicating that only droplet deformation would be occuring in an analogous non-turbulent gas ﬂow. However, {{it is found that}} the SMD decreases by as much as 20 µm with increasing Reynolds number and by 10 µm with increasing tube length. Increasing the tube length from 4. 7 to 43 diameters whilst keeping the Reynolds number constant results in a dif-ferent ﬂow proﬁle at the exit plane, varying from under-developed, to transitional, and ﬁnally to a fully developed turbulent ﬂow. This increase in tube length leads to a consistent decrease in the SMD of the <b>dilute</b> <b>spray,</b> acting as evidence of turbulence enhanced secondary atomization. 8 page(s...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{we report}} an {{original}} experimental approach for mapping the droplets Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) of a hollow-cone water spray using the SLIPI-LIF/MIE technique. Water {{mixed with a}} non-toxic fluorescing dye is continuously injected at 20 bars injection pressure and the formed hollow-cone spray is illuminated using a continuous wave laser. The illumination wavelength is carefully chosen (here, 447 nm) to excite the injected dye/water mixture, which generates a significant Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) signal peaking at 514 nm. The LIF and Mie signals are recorded using a CCD camera and their intensity ratio is used to extract a two-dimensional distribution of the droplets SMD. In this article, we show that even for {{the case of a}} <b>dilute</b> hollow-cone <b>spray,</b> where single scattering events are in majority (OD~ 1), the LIF/Mie measurement of droplets SMD still remains strongly affected by multiple light scattering.

40|$|In {{line with}} the general theme of the International Workshop series on Turbulent Combustion of Sprays (TCS), this Chapter {{addresses}} relevant issues of turbulent flame structure, auto-ignition and atomization with reference to wellcharacterized burners that could be implemented by modelers with relative ease. The discussion of turbulent combustion is limited to <b>dilute</b> <b>sprays</b> stabilized on a simple piloted burner. Attention is shifted {{to the structure of}} the reaction zones and the challenges of computing chemical composition of flames of different fuels. Another section is dedicated to studying auto-ignition of turbulent <b>dilute</b> <b>spray</b> flames as observed in a hot vitiated co-flow. A common feature to all liquid fuels studied here is the presence of ignition kernels which grow (and sometimes extinguish) to induce flaming combustion further downstream. It is noted that this downstream region is responsible for the bulk of heat release and its local compositional structure depends on the parent fuel. The last section focuses on non-reacting dense sprays with a view to shed some light on the effects of turbulence on secondary atomization. Two configurations are discussed: one for droplets flowing in a pipe and the other uses dense sprays generated with an air assisted atomizer. The carrier velocity is changed in both configurations to induce turbulence which affects atomization as clearly demonstrated by the reported measurements. While this chapter is not necessarily a roadmap for the efforts of future TCS workshops, the topics addressed here form a logical progression that is somewhat commensurate with the increasing order of complexity generally sought for computations. 29 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{breakup of}} a liquid jet into {{irregular}} liquid structures and droplets {{leading to the}} formation of a <b>dilute</b> <b>spray</b> has been simulated numerically. To overcome the shortcomings of certain numerical methods in specific flow regimes, a combined approach has been chosen. The intact liquid core, its primary breakup and the dense spray regime are simulated using the volumes of fluid (VOF) method in combination with LES, whereas the Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT) approach in the LES context is applied to the <b>dilute</b> <b>spray</b> regime and the secondary breakup of droplets. A method has been developed to couple both simulation types on a statistical basis. This statistical coupling approach (SCA) reflects the dominating physical mechanisms of the two-phase flow in each regime to a high degree. The main benefit of the SCA is computational efficiency as compared with the more straightforward approach where one follows each structure, denoted here as the direct coupling approach. The computational benefits stem from the reduction of computational time since the VOF simulation is run only until statistical convergence and not during the whole spray development. A second benefit using the SCA is the possibility to use the stochastic parcel method in the LPT simulation whereby a large number of droplets may be handled. The coupling approach is applied to the atomization of a fuel jet in a high pressure chamber, demonstrating the gain of efficiency of the SCA as compared with direct coupling approach.
