25|$|In {{the early}} morning of 22 May 2013, a girlfriend {{of one of the}} sons left the house. At 6:40AM, Mrs. Haroková called the grammar school where she worked, saying that she had a bad {{headache}} and would take the day off. The police believe that she and two other victims were killed between this time and 8:00AM, which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> at which Mrs Haroková's wristwatch stopped. A post woman arrived at the door shortly before nine. The doorbell was answered by Dahlgren, who accepted the mail. Two hours later, a cleaner came to the house, but was sent away by Dahlgren immediately after entering the hallway. Meanwhile, the fourth victim, David, who was at school, received text messages from Dahlgren's phone that they would go running after his return. David was probably murdered immediately after returning to the house around 12:30PM.|$|E
25|$|Althusser conceives {{of society}} as an {{interconnected}} collection of these wholes: economic practice, ideological practice, and politico-legal practice. Although each practice has a degree of relative autonomy, together they make up one complex, structured whole (social formation). In his view, all levels and practices are dependent on each other. For example, among the relations of production of capitalist societies are the buying and selling of labour power by capitalists and workers. These relations are part of economic practice, but can only exist {{within the context of}} a legal system which establishes individual agents as buyers and sellers; furthermore, the arrangement must be maintained by political and ideological means. From this it can be seen that aspects of economic practice depend on the superstructure and vice versa. For him this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> of reproduction and constituted the important role of the superstructure.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Schultz stated that {{a series of}} events changed his {{political}} views from the right of the political spectrum to left of the spectrum. One event was his mother's battle with Alzheimer's Disease, which began a long, slow decline of her mental health. Schultz found it frustrating trying to get her the services that she needed. Another was that he met a psychiatric nurse named Wendy who ran a homeless shelter in Fargo, North Dakota. He attributed much of his political change to her. Although he had criticized the homeless on his show, he said in his book that she helped to humanize them and he reportedly found that some of the people he had insulted were veterans, unable to get the psychiatric or medical services that might help them. He says that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> he began to look at poverty differently.|$|E

The three Duchamp brothers, Marcel Duchamp, Jacques Villon and Raymond Duchamp-Villon, and another artist known as Picabia {{took part in the}} exhibition. Following this salon Metzinger wrote the article Notes sur la peinture, in which he compares the similarities in the works Picasso, Braque, Delaunay, Gleizes and Le Fauconnier. In doing so he enunciated for the first time what would become known as the characteristics of Cubism: notably the notions of simultaneity, mobile perspective. In this seminal text Metzinger stressed the distance between their works and traditional perspective. These artists, he wrote, granted themselves 'the liberty of moving around objects', and combining many different views in one image, each recording varying experiences over the course of time.|$|E

500|$|Congress had by the Act of March 3, 1863 {{authorized}} fractional {{currency in}} the denomination of 3 cents; when these notes reached circulation {{the following year}} they proved wildly unpopular. The 1864 law which had substituted bronze for copper-nickel had also outlawed [...] "copperheads" [...] or private token issues. Even though these could now only be issued anonymously, and so could not be redeemed, the copperheads were preferred to the 3-cent shinplasters. [...] Some copperhead tokens even read [...] "Substitute for shinplasters". The notes soon became filthy and ragged, making them even more disliked. They were more difficult to value in quantity than notes with denominations divisible by five. According to Walter Breen, [...] "This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> Wharton's supporters had been waiting for." [...] Wharton and his advocates argued that the three-cent notes should be redeemed with equivalent coins. They contended that were Congress to order a three-cent bronze coin, such a piece would {{be as big as}} an obsolete large cent, and might be used to deceive the blind into accepting the pre-1857 cent rather than the more valuable coin.
