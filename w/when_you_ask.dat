Paul Attanasio of The Washington Post said [...] "the film showcases a visual stylist utterly in command of his talents" [...] and that Angelo Badalamenti [...] "contributes an {{extraordinary}} score, slipping seamlessly from slinky jazz to violin figures to the romantic sweep of a classic Hollywood score," [...] but stated that Lynch [...] "isn't interested in communicating, he's interested in parading his personality. The movie doesn't progress or deepen, it just gets weirder, and to no good end." [...] A general criticism from U.S. critics was Blue Velvets often vulgar approach to sexuality and violence. They asserted that this detracted from the film's seriousness {{as a work of}} art, and some condemned the film as pornographic. One of its detractors, Roger Ebert, praised Isabella Rossellini's performance as [...] "convincing and courageous" [...] but criticized how she was depicted in the film, even accusing David Lynch of misogyny: [...] "degraded, slapped around, humiliated and undressed in front of the camera. And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> an actress to endure those experiences, you should keep your side of the bargain by putting her in an important film." [...] While Ebert in later years came to consider Lynch a great filmmaker, his negative view of Blue Velvet remained unchanged after he revisited it in the 21st century.|$|E

[...] It is a resounding [...] "NO". Can Iraq produce today chemical weapons on a meaningful scale? No! Can Iraq produce biological weapons on a meaningful scale? No! Ballistic missiles? No! It is [...] "no" [...] across the board. So from a qualitative standpoint, Iraq has been disarmed. Iraq today possesses no meaningful {{weapons of mass destruction}} capability.|$|E

2500|$|Available {{evidence}} suggests that veiling was not introduced into Arabia by Muhammad, but already existed there, particularly in the towns, although it was probably not as widespread as in the neighboring countries such as Syria and Palestine. Similarly to the practice among Greeks, Romans, Jews, and Assyrians, its use was associated with high social status. In the early Islamic texts, term hijab does not distinguish between veiling and seclusion, and can mean either [...] "veil" [...] or [...] "curtain". The only verses in the Qur'an that specifically reference women’s clothing are those promoting modesty, instructing women to guard their private parts and throw a scarf over their heads to their bosoms {{in the presence of}} men. The contemporary understanding of the hijab dates back to Hadith when the [...] "verse of the hijab" [...] descended upon the community in 627 CE. Now documented in Sura 33:53, the verse states, [...] "And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> [...] for something, ask them from behind a partition. That is purer for your hearts and their hearts". This verse, however, was not addressed to women in general, but exclusively to Muhammad's wives. As Muhammad's influence increased, he entertained more and more visitors in the mosque, which was then his home. Often, these visitors stayed the night only feet away from his wives' apartments. It is commonly understood that this verse was intended to protect his wives from these strangers. During Muhammad's lifetime the term for donning the veil, darabat al-hijab, was used interchangeably with [...] "being Muhammad's wife".|$|E
