Based on the experiments, {{the effect}} of <b>waste</b> <b>gypsum</b> on the {{formation}} of paste structure, the early strength and the stability of lime-fly ash is discussed in the article. As is shown by the results, the early strength of paste was improved by adding <b>waste</b> <b>gypsum</b> into lime-fly ash. The stability of lime-fly ash paste modified by <b>waste</b> <b>gypsum</b> could meet technical requirements when <b>waste</b> <b>gypsum</b> admixture was less than 40 %.

40|$|Mixtures of fine bauxite {{refining}} residue (red mud), <b>waste</b> <b>gypsum</b> {{and local}} sandy soil that are proposed {{to be used}} in a catchment nutrient management program, were watered in columns simulating rainfall over a period of 2 yr {{and the quality of the}} leachate determined. The major salts released were sodium sulphate, a product of red mud alkalinity neutralization by gypsum, and excess gypsum released at its solubility concentration. At an application rate of 850 t ha− 1 of red mud the salts leached to groundwater (40 kg t− 1 red mud) would be equivalent to salts leached by rainfall over a 20 yr period from soil without red mud application, and would pose no significant impact when applied to the sandy agricultural soils in the catchment area of an estuary. The leaching of Al, Fe, and Cd from the red mud and gypsum was negligible, while the retention of superphosphate was over 99 %.

40|$|Red Mud and red sand are waste {{products}} of Alumina refining where the Al in bauxite is dissolved {{in a solution}} of NaOH at high temperatures and pressures and precipitated (this is the Bayer Process).

This is Z tonnes of red mud for every tonne of alumina produced (Robson(1982)). This amount of waste causes a disposal problem for Alcoa. At present the wastes are impounded in red mud lakes which are costly to build and maintain. ALCOA is investigating the use of red mud as a soil conditioner (Ward(1983) {{as an alternative to the}} present disposal system.

40|$|The {{disposal}} of fine bauxite refining residue (red mud) has occupied huge areas of land which remain derelict {{and subject to}} wind and water erosion. The major constraints in rehabilitation are the high alkalinity, salinity and sodicity of red mud. This paper describes a greenhouse study {{to evaluate the use}} of <b>waste</b> <b>gypsum</b> as ameliorants for red mud. Red mud was amended with gypsum at 0, 2, 5 and 8 % (w/w) and its effect on the growth of two grass species, Agropyron elongatum (Tall wheat grass) and Cynodon dactylon (Bermuda grass), was evaluated. Gypsum amendment significantly reduced the pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and Na and Al content of red mud and provided a continuous supply of Ca 2 +, which resulted in a lower soil exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP). The improved soil conditions at ≥ 5 % gypsum amendment significantly increased seedling emergence and dry weight yields. The enhanced plant growth and seedling emergence show significant negative correlations with pH, Al and ESP of soil. Tissue analyses indicated that the availability of P, K, Mg and Ca also increased for ≥ 5 % gypsum amended red mud, while Na and Fe were less available. Results from the present study indicated that <b>waste</b> <b>gypsum</b> is an effective ameliorant for red mud revegetation and no topsoil amendment is required...|$|E
40|$|The {{regeneration}} {{of calcium}} oxide from gypsum is {{the interest of}} this research. Gypsum was converted to calcium oxide via a two-step process involving chemical and thermal reactions.

Gypsum was converted into calcium hydroxide by reacting with sodium hydroxide, 0. 1 M, solution. Then, calcium hydroxide was calcined, at 700 °C, to form calcium oxide.

40|$|Gypsum is {{produced}} as a waste product by various industries, e. g. the fertilizer industry, the mining industry and power stations. Gypsum waste disposal sites {{are responsible for}} the leaching of saline water into surface and underground water and create airborne dust. Gypsum waste is not only an environmental problem but has measurable economic value as well. However, all these environmental and economical concerns can be avoided should valuable/saleable by-products like sulphur and calcium carbonate be recovered from the low quality gypsum. The aim of this project was to evaluate a process for converting <b>waste</b> <b>gypsum</b> into sulphur. The process evaluated consists of the following stages: reduction of gypsum to calcium sulphide; stripping of the sulphide with CO 2 gas and the production of sulphur. Thermal reduction study showed that gypsum can be reduced to CaS with activated carbon in a tube furnace operating at 1100 º C. The CaS yield was 96 %. The CaS formed was slurried in water. The reaction of gaseous CO 2 with the CaS slurry leads to the stripping of sulphide to form H 2 S gas and the precipitation of CaCO 3. The H 2 S generated was then reacted in the iron (IIII) and PIPco processes to form elemental sulphur.

40|$|Natural sand {{deposits}} and waste screenings from gravel pits and quarries are abundant {{in parts of}} Sweden. Investigations {{have been made to}} stabilize such materials with binders based on waste materials. Both laboratory work and test roads have been performed. In the latter case, mainly secondary roads have been strengthened with a plant-mixed bases. Good results have been achieved with a binder made of milled granulated blast furnace slag, activated with lime or especially with both lime and <b>waste</b> <b>gypsum.</b> Sand and screenings from gravel often contain organic material, deleterous with the binders studied. In such cases, the gypsum addition also seems to counteract the negative effect of the organic material. Fly ash has recently been available in Sweden. Tests made with fly ash-lime, as often used for stabilization abroad,have shown too slow binding for a rather cold climate. Addition of <b>waste</b> <b>gypsum,</b> calcium chloride, alkali-salts or use of an alkali-rich cement kiln dust instead of commercial lime can improve the binding properties. Different fly ashes, however, react in different ways. It is often more suitable to use fly ash-cement as a binder, especially with poorly graded aggregates. The fly ash, added in an optimum amount, work as a filler and high immediate stabilities can be achieved at a correct water content. The puzzolanic properties of the fly ash, at the same time, makes it possible to reduce the cement content considerably in comparison with the case when only portland cement is used as a binder. Promising laboratory work has also been done with binders consisting of condensed silica fume or ash from fluidized bed coal combustion, both in combination with lime.

The objective {{of this study was}} to examine both the general circumstances in which <b>gypsum</b> <b>waste</b> can cease to be waste and also examine a specific intended use for gypsum waste; using recycled gypsum as fuel additive in biofuel plants which not have permission to burn waste. The method used is mainly interviews with authorities and stakeholders in the gypsum industry as well as analysis of relevant case law. The results shows that stakeholders in the gypsum industry and the regulating authorities considered that recycled gypsum, which is used as raw material in the manufacture of new plasterboards, should be classified as a non-waste material. If recycled gypsum shall be used in new application areas such as the intended use of <b>gypsum</b> <b>waste</b> as fuel additives it has to be a legal examination case by case.

In order to protect the environment and reduce the amount of pollution flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) is used to remove SO 2 from exhaust flue gases of fossil-fuel power plants. As a result of this process gypsum waste is produced that can be used in practical applications. Strength and permeability tests have been made and also in-depth analysis of energy consumption of production process to investigate ways of preparing the synthetic gypsum for casting moulds application. This paper also assesses the chemical composition, strength and permeability of moulds made with synthetic gypsum, in comparison with moulds made with traditional GoldStar XL gypsum and with ceramic molds. Moreover examination of structure of synthetic gypsum, the investigations on derivatograph and calculations of energy consumption during production process of synthetic gypsum in wet flue-gas desulfurization were made.
