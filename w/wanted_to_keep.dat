5|$|An action {{scene was}} filmed with a motion-control camera, a first in Indian cinema.

5|$|Although {{they were}} not penalized, Nuggets coach George Karl and Knicks coach Isiah Thomas were both {{scrutinized}} for their part in the brawl. Carmelo Anthony was also criticized for harming his image as a star, and several writers said the league had penalized the players excessively because it <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> its image free from violence.|$|E

It comes {{to the point that}} he continuously contradicts himself by <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Lydia with him, but also <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> her safe by pushing her far away from himself.|$|R
25|$|India has {{to decide}} whether it <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the tiger or not. It {{has to decide}} if it is {{worthwhile}} <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> its National Symbol, its icon, representing wildlife. It has to decide if it <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> its natural heritage for future generations, a heritage {{more important than the}} cultural one, whether we speak of its temples, the Taj Mahal, or others, because once destroyed it cannot be replaced.|$|R
5|$|O'Malley was {{featured}} {{prominently in the}} HBO documentary film , which chronicled his executive management of the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers. The documentary focuses on the post World War II glory years of the franchise and presents a compelling case that O'Malley truly <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the Dodgers in Brooklyn in a stadium near a railroad station, but {{he was unable to}} get the proper support from Moses.|$|E
5|$|On Valentine's Day in Kroner, Kansas, Sheila Fontaine and Daryl Mootz {{get into}} an argument.

After the argument, Mootz goes for a drunken drive but crashes after heart-shaped hailstones wreck his car.|$|E
5|$|Some locals <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> Fornebu as a {{regional}} airport for the Oslo and Bærum area. The proposal was to keep part of the runway and terminals and allow aircraft such as the Bombardier Dash 8, Fokker 50 and British Aerospace 146 to use the airport. Proponents argued that a similar role was filled by Stockholm-Bromma Airport and Chicago's Midway Airport.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of the live action footage was deleted; because Bakshi <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the breakdancing sequences, he used rotoscoping to animate the footage, but did not animate all of the movements for budgetary reasons. Little dialogue from the 1974 cut of the film was retained in the animated version, which instead featured newly recorded dialogue by Proval, Romanus, and Philip Michael Thomas, who had starred in Coonskin.|$|E
5|$|Before all the {{steerage}} passengers {{had even}} {{a chance of}} their lives, the Titanics sailors fastened the doors and companionways leading up from the third-class section... A crowd of men {{was trying to get}} up to a higher deck and were fighting the sailors; all striking and scuffling and swearing. Women and some children were there praying and crying. Then the sailors fastened down the hatchways leading to the third-class section. They said they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the air down there so the vessel could stay up longer. It meant all hope was gone for those still down there.|$|E
5|$|Duhalde was {{appointed}} {{president in the}} aftermath of the September 11 attacks, when the foreign policy of the United States was strictly focused on the War on Terror. Initially, the Argentine society was divided on how to manage the bilateral relations with the US. One group <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the close relations of the previous decade, as Argentina might need foreign help to deal with the crisis. The other group preferred to maintain more distant relations. Duhalde sought to strike a balance between both options, and eventually leaned towards the second when the US refused to help Argentina.|$|E

5|$|The Revolutionary War was {{ended by}} the Treaty of Paris in 1783, and by 1785 the Continental Navy was disbanded and the {{remaining}} ships were sold. The frigate , which had fired the last shots of the American Revolutionary War, was also the last ship in the Navy. A faction within Congress <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the ship, but the new nation {{did not have the}} funds to keep her in service. Other than a general lack of money, factors for the disarmament of the navy were the loose confederation of the states, a change of goals from war to peace, and more domestic and fewer foreign interests.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{reasons for}} the Second Settlement were as follows. First, after Augustus relinquished the annual consulship, {{he was no longer}} in an {{official}} position to rule the state, yet his dominant position remained unchanged over his Roman, 'imperial' provinces where he was still a proconsul. When he annually held the office of consul, he had the power to intervene with the affairs of the other provincial proconsuls appointed by the Senate throughout the empire, when he deemed necessary. When he relinquished his annual consulship, he legally lost this power because his proconsular powers applied only to his imperial provinces. Augustus <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> this power.|$|E
5|$|Although Emily Huskisson had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> {{the service}} {{small-scale}} and free from pageantry, William Huskisson {{had been an}} instrumental figure {{in the development of}} Liverpool and there was a huge amount of sympathy and respect for him. Almost all the city's inhabitants who were in a position to attend the funeral lined the route; it was estimated that 69,000 people, roughly half the city's population, attended. Reports spoke of all available space at every window being packed with onlookers, other than the house in Duke Street in which Huskisson had stayed for the 10 days before the journey, and of people climbing trees and crowding onto roofs for a better view, despite rain and hail.|$|E

5|$|Byers, Rechlicz, Stoa, Syner and Wellar {{were all}} re-signed for the 2013–14 season, and Deschamps and LeBlanc {{received}} qualifying offers from the Washington Capitals. It was announced June 14 that Taffe re-signed with the Bears. The Swedish Hockey League had announced one month earlier that Taffe {{had signed a}} contract with them, but Taffe said that announcement had been premature, and he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his family in North America. In July, the Bears signed four free agents to one-year contracts: defenseman Tyson Strachan, winger Matt Watkins, forward Derek Whitmore and goaltender David Leggio. For the 2013–14 season, Hershey signed defenseman David Kolomatis, Nate Schmidt, and Jaynen Rissling, as well as goaltender Riley Gill, and forwards Josh Brittain, Dustin Gazley, Brandon Segal, and Jamie Johnson, a former linemate of Taffe's with the Rochester Americans.|$|E
5|$|Cernan {{turned down}} the {{opportunity}} {{to walk on the}} Moon as Lunar Module Pilot of Apollo 16, preferring to risk missing a flight altogether for the opportunity to command his own mission. After the cancellation of Apollo 18, NASA decided to send a scientist, Harrison Schmitt, to the Moon. This decision meant the original Lunar Module (LM) pilot, Joe Engle, never had the opportunity to walk on the Moon. Cernan fought to keep his crew together; however, public pressure from the scientific community cemented Schmitt's position on the crew. Even though Cernan <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> his crew together, he had a positive evaluation of Schmitt's abilities. For example, he believed Schmitt was an outstanding LM pilot and that Engle was merely an adequate one.|$|E
5|$|Dino Crisis {{utilizes}} {{an original}} 3D engine with real-time environments, {{as opposed to}} the pre-rendered backgrounds of the Resident Evil series. Mikami chose a real-time engine to enable better cinematic action and more dramatic character depictions that would otherwise be impossible. However, with the real-time engine came the challenge of hardware limitations, making it difficult for the team to create detailed environments. The team had to forego a jungle scene because of this issue. Mikami did however believe the team was able to create sufficiently detailed environments despite the hardware's polygon limitations. Like Resident Evil, the game takes place indoors in an enclosed environment. Mikami <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the claustrophobic feelings, thinking it was better to build fear.|$|E

The film ends with Jennifer back in the Sleeping Beauty tent. Troy is now playing the role of the doctor, and Scarlett plays his nurse.|$|R

5|$|For the game's localization, {{the main}} focus {{was to keep the}} {{dialogue}} natural and accessible to Western players, while also staying true to the Japanese version. The Japanese version had several instances of puns or cultural jokes, which would not have worked if they had been translated literally. There were also places in the script where the development team would have liked to insert jokes in the localization, but thought that it may be inappropriate to do so since the joke was not in the Japanese version. The team found difficulties in getting the Western version's tone right, as they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the localized text interesting, {{and at the same time}} avoid inconsistencies with the original version's tone.|$|E
5|$|In early 1965, Treasury Secretary C. Douglas Dillon {{wrote to}} President Lyndon Johnson, {{opposing}} the dollar and {{pointing out that}} the coins would be unlikely to circulate in Montana or anywhere else; they would simply be hoarded. Nevertheless, Dillon concluded that as Senator Mansfield insisted, the coins would have to be struck. Dillon resigned on April 1; his successor, Henry H. Fowler, was immediately questioned by Mansfield about the dollars, and he assured the senator that things would be worked out to his satisfaction. Mint Director Eva Adams hoped to avoid striking the silver dollars, but <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the $600,000 appropriated for that expense. Senator Mansfield refused to consider any cancellation or delay and on May 12, 1965, the Denver Mint began trial strikes of the 1964-D Peace dollar—the Mint had obtained congressional authorization to continue striking 1964-dated coins into 1965.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{a series of}} letters between Eldon {{businessmen}} and Carl E. Smith, the newly-inherited owner of the house, revealed differing opinions on continued use of the house: Smith wanted to renovate the house and protect it from vandalism only; the Eldon leaders were more in favor of making the house a historic site. The house was abandoned {{for much of the}} 1970s—a bullet was fired in an upstairs bedroom; weather and vandalism took their toll as well. Only in the late 1980s did the owner of the property consider turning the house over to the state. Indeed, many southern Iowans were conflicted on the issue—the owner <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the house only because he believed the current renters would have nowhere else to go if they were forced to leave.|$|E
