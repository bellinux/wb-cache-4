This work deals with this interesting topic analyz-ing, on one hand, the European policy of German govern-ment, from Adenauer {{to the current}} Chancellor Merkel, on the other hand, the European feeling of German citizens. For a long time Europe has been for Germans {{the only place in}} which – and through which – {{it would be possible to}} re-cover the sovereignty and reunification. To achieve this, Germans would have to be more European than Europe-ans. <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>happen</b> after the reunification? And, more recently, did the economic crisis change German attitude toward Europe?

40|$|Esta dissertação tem como fio condutor a seguinte pergunta: o que acontece quando as crianças estão entre elas? Elaboro minhas respostas a partir da análise de cinco filmes escolhidos dentre a filmografia dos diferentes módulos da disciplina Cinema e Infância, do PPGEDU, da linha de pesquisa Estudos sobre Infâncias, da FACEDUFRGS. Os filmes são: Meninos de Tóquio (1932); A Guerra dos Botões (1962); O Senhor das Moscas (1963); Os Meninos da Rua Paulo (1969) e Canto dos Pardais (2008). O trabalho busca identificar e compreender o que acontece quando as crianças-personagens dos cinco filmes estão entre elas, analisando estas interações à luz da Sociologia da Infância, explorando alguns de seus principais conceitos – criança, infância, culturas infantis, cultura de pares, reprodução interpretativa. Utilizo como aporte teórico {{principal}} SARMENTO (2003, 2005, 2009), CORSARO (2009, 2011), PROUT (2010), QVORTRUP (2010), DELGADO (2006) e BARTHES (1990). As crianças produzem culturas através das relações que estabelecem entre elas e com os outros, sendo significadas como atores sociais e sujeitos ativos no processo de sua socialização. Considerando, portanto, as crianças como seres que estão, sim, em desenvolvimento, mas que protagonizam sua história e agem na sociedade em que estão inseridas, é que olho para as crianças-personagens dos filmes, que são protagonistas do meu trabalho. As análises foram realizadas a partir de três variáveis insistentes em cada filme, e é a partir delas que as cenas foram selecionadas: as crianças, quando estão entre elas: 1) mobilizam-se, engajam-se; 2) entram em conflito; 3) organizam-se para alcançarem seus objetivos. As interações entre as crianças-personagens dos filmes geraram dados riquíssimos para análise, que não se esgotam nas variáveis e nos trechos selecionados. The present thesis has {{the following}} guideline question: <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>happen</b> {{when children are}} among themselves? I elaborate these answers through my own analysis of five films, namely, I Was Born, But… (1932), War of the Buttons (1962), Lord of the Flies (1963), The Boys of Paul Street (1969) and The Song of Sparrows (2008). The films were chosen among other titles of the filmography of the discipline Cinema and Childhood offered by the Graduate Program in Education. The investigation aims to analyze the children-characters’ interaction with themselves in the five films. The analysis was done exploring Sociology of Childhood and its main concepts: child, childhood, children’s cultures, peer cultures and interpretative reproduction. As a theoretical referential I base my reasoning in SARMENTO (2003, 2005, 2009), CORSARO (2009, 2011), PROUT (2010), QVORTRUP (2010), DELGADO (2006) e BARTHES (1990). By means of the relationships established with themselves and with others, children produce cultures and are signified as social actors and active subjects {{in the process of}} their socialization. Therefore, children are not only beings in development but also protagonists of their own history acting in the society they are inserted. It is in this manner that I look to the children-characters of the films, which are also the protagonists of my work. I have established three variables that are insistently common to each of the films: 1) children mobilizing or engaging themselves; 2) children conflicting with themselves; 3) children organizing themselves in order to achieving their goals. In the search for a dialogue with Sociology of Childhood, I have selected scenes from the films that were analyzed, taking the variables as starting points. The children-characters have generated plentiful data for analysis that is limited to the variables nor to the selected scenes...|$|R

40|$|Bullying is {{an issue}} that {{continues}} to occur among high school students. Students are engaging in traditional bullying as well as cyberbullying. This study explores students??? experiences with being the victim of bullying and whether these experiences differ based on gender. It also explores students??? experiences with being perpetrators of bullying and whether these experiences differ based on gender. A quantitative study, which uses a traditional survey design, has been used to gain more in-depth knowledge of the relationship between gender and bullying in 105 freshmen. Out of the 105 students 51. 9 % report that they have been victims of some type of bullying and 29 % of students report that they have taken part in bullying other students. Findings show that the most prevalent form that students are victims of is name-calling, making fun of, or being teased in a hurtful way. Additionally, the most prevalent form of bullying towards others is name-calling, making fun of, or teasing others in a hurtful way. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} for the most part, gender did not play a role in being a victim or perpetrator; with the exception of name-calling, making fun of, or being teased and teasing others. It is imperative that social workers who work with vulnerable populations, such as children, understand what bullying is and <b>what</b> to <b>do</b> when <b>it</b> <b>happens...</b>|$|R
60|$|We were {{occupied}} {{the last time}} we met in considering the general character and arrangement as regards the fluid portion of a candle, {{and the way in which}} that fluid got into the place of combustion. You see, when we have a candle burning fairly in a regular, steady atmosphere, it will have a shape something like the one shewn in the diagram, and will look pretty uniform, although very curious in its character. And now, I have to ask your attention to the means by which we are enabled to ascertain what happens in any particular part of the flame--why <b>it</b> <b>happens,</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> in <b>happening,</b> and where, after all, the whole candle goes to: because, as you know very well, a candle being brought before us and burned, disappears, if burned properly, without the least trace of dirt in the candlestick--and this is a very curious circumstance. In order, then, to examine this candle carefully, I have arranged certain apparatus, the use of which you will see as I go on. Here is a candle: I am about to put the end of this glass tube into the middle of the flame--into that part which old Hooker has represented in the diagram as being rather dark, and which you can see at any time, if you will look at a candle carefully, without blowing it about. We will examine this dark part first.|$|R

The objectives of this thesis are summed up in its multi-layered main question, 'What has been the fate of healing ministries in the Anglican Diocese of Sydney, and regarding the Healing Ministry at St Andrew's Cathedral Sydney 1960 - 2010, <b>what</b> <b>happened,</b> why <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>happen,</b> how <b>did</b> the Diocese react, and why'? To answer this question, special attention has been given to oral history through interviews and email enquiries as well as the use of archival records, correspondence and minutes of healing ministry related entities. [...] Two hypotheses are analysed throughout, these are 1) 'That the charisma, initiative and leadership skills of Canon Jim Glennon were the driving forces behind the foundation and growth of the Healing Ministry at St Andrew's Cathedral', and 2) 'That the uncompromising theological position of the Diocese of Sydney has led to the non-support of healing ministries, especially the dismissal of the Charismatic/renewal element of the Healing Ministry at St Andrew's Cathedral'. These two hypotheses are analysed here in terms of classic Revitalization Theory: Glennon was a 'prophet' who challenged the prevailing diocesan mindset; the new paradigm he created was eroded and eventually eliminated by 'prophets' of an even more anti-charismatic mindset than the one he initially challenged. [...] It is here argued, consistent with diocesan opposition to Charismatic beliefs and practices, that there has been a diminution of the Charismatic ethos in the Healing Ministry at St Andrew's Cathedral as successive leaders have been appointed. Glennon (Founder and leader 1960 - 1988), exercised a challenging, low-key Charismatic ministry, well calculated to give it an international reputation. His successor, Canon Jim Holbeck (leader 1988 - 2006), heeding directives from the Diocese, was more restrained in the practice of distinctively Charismatic elements in his ministry, and Canon Christopher Allan (leader from 2008), has excised all Charismatic expression from the Healing Ministry.

60|$|Now, {{whether it}} was the {{strength}} of the compounds, or the beauty of the ladies, or <b>what</b> not, <b>it</b> <b>did</b> so <b>happen</b> that Mr. Augustus Cooper encouraged, rather than repelled, the very flattering attentions of a young lady in brown gauze over white calico who had appeared particularly struck with him from the first; and when the encouragements had been prolonged for some time, Miss Billsmethi betrayed her spite and jealousy thereat by calling the young lady in brown gauze a ‘creeter,’ which induced the young lady in brown gauze to retort, in certain sentences containing a taunt founded on the payment of four-and-sixpence a quarter, which reference Mr. Augustus Cooper, being then and there in a state of considerable bewilderment, expressed his entire concurrence in. Miss Billsmethi, thus renounced, forthwith began screaming in the loudest key of her voice, at the rate of fourteen screams a minute; and being unsuccessful, in an onslaught on the eyes and face, first of the lady in gauze and then of Mr. Augustus Cooper, called distractedly on the other three-and-seventy pupils to furnish her with oxalic acid for her own private drinking; and, the call not being honoured, made another rush at Mr. Cooper, and then had her stay-lace cut, and was carried off to bed. Mr. Augustus Cooper, not being remarkable for quickness of apprehension, was at a loss to understand what all this meant, until Signor Billsmethi explained it in a most satisfactory manner, by stating to the pupils, that Mr. Augustus Cooper had made and confirmed divers promises of marriage to his daughter on divers occasions, and had now basely deserted her; on which, the indignation of the pupils became universal; and as several chivalrous gentlemen inquired rather pressingly of Mr. Augustus Cooper, whether he required anything for his own use, or, in other words, whether he ‘wanted anything for himself,’ he deemed it prudent to make a precipitate retreat. And the upshot of the matter was, that a lawyer’s letter came next day, and an action was commenced next week; and that Mr. Augustus Cooper, after walking twice to the Serpentine for the purpose of drowning himself, and coming twice back without <b>doing</b> <b>it,</b> made a confidante of his mother, who compromised the matter with twenty pounds from the till: which made twenty pounds four shillings and sixpence paid to Signor Billsmethi, exclusive of treats and pumps. And Mr. Augustus Cooper went back and lived with his mother, and there he lives to this day; and as he has lost his ambition for society, and never goes into the world, he will never see this account of himself, and will never be any the wiser.|$|R
