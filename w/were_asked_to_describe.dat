25|$|Many {{researchers}} use self-report {{measures of}} felt emotion as a manipulation check.

For instance, in a study of memory for emotions in supporters of former U.S. presidential candidate Ross Perot, supporters <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> their initial emotional reactions after Perot's unexpected withdrawal in July 1992 and again after the presidential election that November.|$|E

60|$|Among all {{the provinces}} in Scotland, if an {{intelligent}} stranger <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> the most varied {{and the most}} beautiful, it is probable he would name the county of Perth. A native also of any other district of Caledonia, though his partialities might lead him to prefer his native county in the first instance, would certainly class that of Perth in the second, and thus give its inhabitants a fair right to plead that, prejudice apart, Perthshire forms the fairest portion of the Northern kingdom. It is long since Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, with that excellent taste which characterises her writings, expressed her opinion that the most interesting district of every country, and that which exhibits the varied beauties of natural scenery in greatest perfection, is that where the mountains sink down upon the champaign, or more level land. The most picturesque, if not the highest, hills are also {{to be found in}} the county of Perth. The rivers find their way out of the mountainous region by the wildest leaps, and through the most romantic passes connecting the Highlands with the Lowlands. Above, the vegetation of a happier climate and soil is mingled with the magnificent characteristics of mountain scenery, and woods, groves, and thickets in profusion clothe the base of the hills, ascend up the ravines, and mingle with the precipices. It is in such favoured regions that the traveller finds what the poet Gray, or some one else, has termed beauty lying in the lap of terror.|$|E

A clinician will evaluate these descriptions, attempting to discover the conflicts, motivations and attitudes of the respondent. A researcher may use a specific scoring system that establishes consistent criteria of expressed thoughts and described behaviors associated with a specific trait, e.g., the need for Achievement, which has a validated and reliable scoring system. In the answers, the respondent [...] "projects" [...] their unconscious attitudes and motivations into the picture, which is why these are referred to as [...] "{{projective test}}s." ...|$|R
