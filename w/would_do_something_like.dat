500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rotten Tomatoes, Gosling was asked what had attracted him to the film, and whether he had read the script at the time Jackman and director Neil Marshall were attached to it. He replied: I think {{that might be the}} original one I read. I read a few drafts. I read one as well where he wasn't a stunt driver at all, which was a newer draft [...] maybe that's the one Hugh Jackman had; I'm not sure exactly. Basically when I read it, in {{trying to figure out who}} <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> this, the only way to make sense of this is that this is a guy that's seen too many movies, and he's started to confuse his life for a film. He's lost in the mythology of Hollywood and he's become an amalgamation of all the characters that he admires. [...] When Ryan Gosling signed on for the leading role, he was allowed to choose the director, a first in his career. A fan of his work, the actor chose the Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn. [...] "It had to be [...] There was no other choice." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the casting}} call was issued, there was brief {{speculation}} that the character was a recast for Chance Chancellor, {{who was also a}} war veteran. Later, Burton's name was attached to the role. During an appearance on The Talk the following January, Burton officially confirmed that he was cast as Dylan. The episode of The Talk was described as [...] "phenomenal"; Burton had no idea it would have been [...] "New Year's Eve kinda crazy." [...] After one of the show's co-hosts Julie Chen made the announcement of his casting and welcomed Burton to the CBS family, confetti dropped while another co-host Sheryl Underwood did a [...] "wild happy dance". Burton said, [...] "I had no idea about the CBS badge or the welcome basket, or anything. [...] That’s not how I think. I understood why CBS did it, because it’s a big deal. I get it. It’s so strange for me, because I have never been one for all this publicity. They have been so gracious to me, and it was so overwhelming that they <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> that." [...] Burton made his first on-screen appearance during the episode dated January 29, 2013. He attributed much of his success going back to the 1990s when he studied acting at Theater Theater in Hollywood, California, coached by Chris Aable.|$|E
500|$|Alyssa Rosenberg of ThinkProgress {{said that}} {{although}} {{it is common to}} see pop stars being assaulted by men in their videos —exemplifying Rihanna's [...] "Man Down"— the public is aware of Spears's vulnerability, explaining that [...] "we believe she really would choose a guy who <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> this to her." [...] Rosenberg also stated even though her bad behaviour once she leaves her boyfriend is not directed at him, the fact that he treated her badly is a form of narrative permission for her to rob a store and have sex with the criminal. She also commented that the same narrative works on her previous video with Marrs Piliero for [...] "I Wanna Go". The video received comparisons to Rihanna's [...] "We Found Love", which was released two days after [...] "Criminal", on October 19, 2011. Among the similarities, critics noted that they were both filmed in the United Kingdom and arose controversy in the country; both contain scenes of sex, violence and crime; both feature bad boy archetypes and both evoke the personal lives of the artists. Katherine St Asaph found the opening line of Spears's boyfriend ("Would you try smiling just once?") a subtle dig at the press. She explained that there is a tendency among writers and spectators to call [...] "her every smile plastered on or conservator-mandated", and that the fact the line is delivered by her abusive boyfriend only makes it more evident. According to her, that there are two contradictory ways to analyze the relationship between Spears and Trawick as the criminal: it could be seen as him luring her into her life, but Spears is the one that kisses him and she is the first to pull the gun.|$|E

Luria {{was not part}} of the team that originally standardized this test; he was only indirectly referenced by other researchers as a scholar who had published relevant results in the field of neuropsychology.

Hercules tells Beraeus not to send his army, but let him and Iolaus go after Tarlus instead. Beraeus agrees {{and the two men}} set off to find Ramina.|$|R
5000|$|The {{conditions}} for Papadopoulos' overthrow by Ioannides became easier because Papadopoulos {{would not believe}} Markezinis and others in his circle when warned about Ioannides' plans to overthrow him. In fact Papadopoulos' reply to Markezinis was: [...] "Mimis for Dimitrios, Ioannides' first name is an [...] "Arsakeiás", he <b>would</b> never <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> that".

Rodgers' son Richard Rodgers II became a tight end for the Green Bay Packers in 2014. On December 3, 2015, the younger Rodgers had heroics of his own, catching a Hail Mary from Aaron Rodgers with no time left to help them beat the Detroit Lions 27–23. The Hail Mary was quickly coined as [...] "The Miracle in Motown". After the game Richard Rodgers II admitted thinking about The Play his father was part of stating [...] "It's a really special moment for him and I was kind of thinking on the play before, when Aaron got the facemask, I was kind of thinking we <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> that.

2500|$|Several sources {{suggested}} possible {{motives for}} Wong's attack, including feelings of being [...] "degraded and disrespected" [...] for his poor English language skills, depression over losing his job, and difficulty in finding work in New York. A {{few years before}} the killings, he had worked as an engineer at Endicott Interconnect Technologies, a high-tech electronics company. In 2004, the company laid off five percent of its workforce. A coworker from that time said of him, [...] "He was quiet—not a violent person" [...] and [...] "I can't believe he <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> this". Press TV noted that Taliban leader Baituallah Mehsud {{claimed responsibility for the}} shootings, stating, [...] "They were my men. I gave them orders in reaction to US drone attacks." [...] However, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation discounted the claim as inconsistent with their evidence that Wong was a lone gunman.|$|E
6000|$|Around {{this terrible}} spot the Franciscans have done {{something}} which will strike many good and thoughtful people as quite fantastically inadequate; and which strikes me as fantastically but precisely right. They have laid out the garden simply as a garden, {{in a way that}} is completely natural because it is completely artificial. They have made flower-beds in the shape of stars and moons, and coloured them with flowers like those in the backyard of a cottage. The combination of these bright patterns in the sunshine with the awful shadow in the centre is certainly an incongruity in the sense of a contrast. But it is a poetical contrast, like that of birds building in a temple or flowers growing on a tomb. The best way of suggesting what I for one feel about it would be something like this; suppose we imagine a company of children, such as those whom Christ blessed in Jerusalem, afterwards put permanently in charge of a field full of his sorrow; it is probable that, if they could do anything with it, they <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> this. They might cut it up into quaint shapes and dot it with red daisies or yellow marigolds. I really do not know that there is anything better that grown up people could do, since anything that the greatest of them could do must be, must look quite as small. [...] "Shall I, the gnat that dances in Thy ray, dare to be reverent?" [...] The Franciscans have not dared to be reverent; they have only dared to be cheerful. It may be too awful an adventure of the imagination to imagine Christ in that garden. But there is not the smallest difficulty about imagining St. Francis there; and that is something to say of an institution which is eight hundred years old.|$|E

He notes Sawaki has Aguesia, a {{disorder}} that robs the ability to taste. He supports this by the fact Sawaki was tasting chili pepper, while a regular sommelier <b>would</b> never <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> this. He also mentions that while Conan brought mineral water to the crew, Sawaki's cup was the only one with salt. He actually strangled Murakami to death.|$|R
