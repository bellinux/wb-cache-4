5|$|<b>Weather</b> <b>ship</b> {{observations}} {{proved to}} be helpful in wind and wave studies, as commercial shipping tended to avoid weather systems for safety reasons, whereas the weather ships did not. They were also helpful in monitoring storms at sea, such as tropical cyclones. Beginning in the 1970s, their role was largely superseded by weather buoys because of the ships' significant cost. The removal of a <b>weather</b> <b>ship</b> became a negative factor in forecasts {{leading up to the}} Great Storm of 1987. The last <b>weather</b> <b>ship</b> was Polarfront, known as weather station M ("Mike"), which was removed from operation on January 1, 2010. Weather observations from ships continue from a fleet of voluntary merchant vessels in routine commercial operation.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the Navy {{asked for}} control of Sea Cloud and Nourmahal, another former yacht {{converted}} into a <b>weather</b> <b>ship.</b> On April 9, 1943, the United States Navy commissioned Sea Cloud as USS Sea Cloud (IX-99), though she maintained a Coast Guard crew. She was assigned to Task Force 24.|$|E
5|$|A <b>weather</b> <b>ship,</b> or Ocean Station Vessel, was a ship {{stationed}} in the ocean as a platform for surface and upper air meteorological observations for use in weather forecasting. They were primarily located in the north Atlantic and north Pacific oceans, reporting via radio. In addition to their weather reporting function, these vessels aided in search and rescue operations, supported transatlantic flights, acted as research platforms for oceanographers, monitored marine pollution, and aided weather forecasting both by weather forecasters and within computerized atmospheric models. Research vessels remain heavily used in oceanography, including physical oceanography and the integration of meteorological and climatological data in Earth system science.|$|E

5000|$|The {{establishment}} of <b>weather</b> <b>ships</b> {{proved to be}} so useful during World War II that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) had established a global network of 13 <b>weather</b> <b>ships</b> by 1948, with seven operated by the United States, one operated jointly by the United States and Canada, two supplied by the United Kingdom, one maintained by France, one a joint venture by the Netherlands and Belgium, and one shared by the United Kingdom, Norway, and Sweden.

5|$|Sea Cloud is a sailing {{cruise ship}} of the Sea Cloud Cruises line. Initially {{built as a}} private yacht, it {{subsequently}} served as a <b>weather</b> <b>ship</b> for the United States Coast Guard and United States Navy during World War II. The ship served as the first racially integrated warship in the United States Armed Forces since the American Civil War. Following the war, Sea Cloud was returned to private ownership, serving as a yacht for numerous people, including as presidential yacht of the Dominican Republic. The ship currently sails in Europe and the Caribbean {{as part of a}} fleet of sail cruise ships operated by Sea Cloud Cruises GmbH of Hamburg, Germany, often under contract to the National Geographic Society.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} {{stationary}} <b>weather</b> <b>ship</b> was proposed as early as 1921 by Météo-France to help support shipping and the coming of transatlantic aviation. They were used during World War II but had no means of defense, {{which led to the}} loss of several ships and many lives. On the whole, the establishment of weather ships proved to be so useful during World War II for Europe and North America that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) established a global network of weather ships in 1948, with 13 to be supplied by Canada, the United States, and Europe. This number was eventually negotiated down to nine. The agreement of the use of weather ships by the international community ended in 1985.|$|E
