Rater called it [...] "her favorite scene", explaining: [...] "I loved the scene where Owen, Derek and Mark take Cristina, Meredith and Lexie to the baseball field. This {{is one of the first}} times Owen has seen Cristina's intensity. And I love that he makes her leave the hospital, focus on something else. That's why he's so good for her. The scene was actually inspired by Shonda saying, let's do a scene where they're all playing baseball. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> saw it, it makes me want to write more scenes like that, with our doctors outside of the hospital, little glimpses of them in real life." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{staying with}} the show for eight seasons, Gray ran into trouble when she {{requested}} the producers of the show to adjust her contract {{to allow her to}} direct, as did the contracts of male co-stars Duffy and Hagman. The request initially led to producers' firing the actress from the serial, though the decision was later reversed when Dallas star Larry Hagman threatened to quit the show unless Gray were rehired. Gray stated in an interview with TV Guide, [...] "The producers said, 'But you're doing so well.' I thought, 'Oh, look out! I'm on the warpath now.' It was a struggle, though, because it was a man's show. And they fired me. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> told Larry, he went with me into the office and said, 'If she doesn't come back, I don't come back. I can't be playing J.R. Ewing without Sue Ellen.' He was very loyal and, honestly, a very smart businessman. He knew that truly, it was a huge relationship to the show." [...] We'll drink to that!" ...|$|E
500|$|Nichols {{was cast}} as Shana [...] "Scarlett" [...] O'Hara in the live-action film {{adaptation}} of the G.I. Joe franchise [...] (2009) in late 2007. She later said that she accepted director Stephen Sommers' offer for the role without having read the actual script. [...] "I'd heard from other people that the script was quite good. And then <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> got to read it myself... I really, really liked it... I liked {{that there were two}} kick-ass female roles. And I liked the fact that it wasn't just a big action movie... And there was comedy in it. I was genuinely really happily surprised when I read the script." [...] She put on approximately [...] of muscle for the role and trained in mixed martial arts with co-star Sienna Miller for some of the film's action sequences. Nichols was burned by a flame during the filming of a fight scene with Miller. Like The Amityville Horror, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra was not well received by most critics, but performed well at the box office. Richard Corliss of Time wrote that Nichols had [...] "an appealing manner and comely biceps" [...] as Scarlett O'Hara and took notice of her [...] "savory girl fight with Sienna Miller, as the mostly villainous Baroness." [...] After G.I. Joe, Nichols' next project was the horror film For Sale by Owner, where she played Anna Farrier. Going straight-to-video on October 27, 2009, the movie went largely unnoticed by critics and audiences alike.|$|E

Smith had also worked with Kravitz' mother Roxie Roker, on the hit sitcom The Jeffersons. Kravitz urged Smith to manage his career and assist him in finding a record deal. In {{less than a month}} of shopping the recordings, five labels (Warner Bros, Elektra, Geffen, Capitol and Virgin) were in a bidding war for Kravitz. Eventually a deal was made with Virgin Records in January 1989, and signed by Virgin A executive Nancy Jeffries. The label was excited about the music he was making, music inspired by his relationship with wife Bonet and their new daughter, Zoe. On Smith's urging, Kravitz dropped the name Romeo Blue and reclaimed the Lenny Kravitz moniker. About his time as Romeo Blue, Kravitz said, [...] "Ultimately, it got me back to myself. And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> did accept myself for myself, music started flowing out of me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critic Gunther Schuller declared, [...] "On {{one point}} there is {{universal}} agreement: Tatum's awesome technique." [...] That technique {{was marked by}} a calm physical demeanor and efficiency. [...] Tatum did not indulge in theatrical physical or facial expression. [...] The effortless gliding of his hands over difficult passages baffled most who witnessed the phenomenon. [...] He especially astonished other pianists to whom Tatum appeared to be [...] "playing the impossible." [...] Even when playing scintillating runs at high velocity, it appeared that his fingers hardly moved. [...] Hank Jones said: <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> met him and {{got a chance to}} hear him play in person, it seemed as if he wasn't really exerting much effort, he had an effortless way of playing. It was deceptive. You'd watch him and you couldn't believe what was coming out, what was reaching your ears. He didn't have that much motion at the piano. He didn’t make a big show of moving around and waving his hands and going through all sorts of physical gyrations to produce the music that he produced, so that in itself is amazing. There had to be intense concentration there, but you couldn’t tell by just looking at him play.|$|E

With such a wealth of new material, director Hudlin said, [...] "sometimes we used score, sometimes we'd use a song by L.A. and Face, or sometimes Marcus would {{take some of the}} songs they had written and do score interpolations of it. For example, one of the songs, [...] "Love Shoulda Brought You Home", is a great example. That came from a line of dialogue where Halle is furious with Eddie, says 'love should've brought your ass home last night,' slaps him. At that time, L.A. leans over to me and goes 'that's a great song title.' I said, 'great idea.' They write a song, [...] "Love Shoulda Brought You Home". I said, 'well, who we going to get to sing it?' And they said 'well you know, we've got this great young singer who sang the demo, Reggie. If you like the demo then we can use her.'

2500|$|At the 1985 French Open, Evert {{would play}} her {{antagonist}} in Navratilova {{in the final}} {{for the third time}} here in Paris at Roland Garros. [...] In the first set, Evert would take the first three games, which Evert held her serve steady, and she broke Navratilova during the second game. [...] Evert would lose her serve in the fifth game of the set that gave her opponent a chance to level the set at three games-all, and she did just that. [...] To wrap up the set, Evert would rally off the next three games to take the set six games to three, breaking Navratilova in the eight game. [...] In the second set, it would be rather competitive with many ebbs and flows, even more so than the first set. [...] Evert would hold serve in the second set all the way until the eighth game, which Navratilova broke her serve to get back on serve, and would hold in the ninth game to take a five games to four advantage. [...] This set was still in doubt because both could not manage to hold serves and in the eleventh and twelfth games both would take turns in breaking each other's serves. [...] This sent the second set to a tiebreaker, which Navratilova would roar out of the gates with a four to one points advantage, and Evert could not manage {{to get back in the}} breaker that ended seven points to four. [...] In the 52 minute third set, Evert would storm out to a three games to love advantage, but knowing Navratilova, Evert found herself in a tumultuous battle for the title because her opponent would break back to level the set three games-all. [...] Evert managed to stave off a crucial break point opportunity in the seventh game of the set, when Navratilova guided her forehand into the net, and the score went to four game to three. [...] Evert broke Navratilova in the eighth game of the set, which allowed Evert to serve for the match at five games to three. [...] Evert would be incapable to serve out the match during the ninth game, which Navratilova broke, so this made the score five games to four. [...] In addition, Evert would serve twice for the match, but was broken at 15 and love in those games. [...] This failure to convert would cost Evert some grief by having in the eleventh game, which was because she got down love-40 on serve. [...] It took some fantastic shot making in order to divert having to break to stay in the match, which it a twist-of-fate Evert would break her opponent in the subsequent game to take the lead at six games to five. [...] Evert serving for the match at 30-all hit a winner crosscourt, and at match point went down the line, which then the championships was hers after a two-hour and 52 minute final tussle of the clash-of-the-tennis-titans. [...] Evert said [...] "when I hit the last winner down the line I was really proud of myself...I never gave up and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> got to match point I went for a winner and I hit it. I had held my emotions in for so long that I really kind of let go." [...] This title was her sixth French Open title and 17th slam for her career.|$|E
