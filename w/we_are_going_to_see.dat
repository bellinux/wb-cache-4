500|$|Gillard, as a Member of Parliament, {{voted against}} {{a bill that}} would have legalised {{same-sex}} marriage in Australia in 2011. In 2010 she stated [...] "the Marriage Act is appropriate in its current form, that is recognising that marriage is between a man and a woman" [...] and that marriage being between a man and woman [...] "has a special status". The triennial Labor conference held in December 2011 saw Gillard successfully negotiate an amendment on same-sex marriage to see the party introduce a conscience vote to parliament through a private member's bill, rather than a binding vote. When the private members bill was introduced by Labor backbencher Stephen Jones, it was defeated in the House of Representatives on 19 September 2012. In September 2014, Gillard said that the [...] "course of human history now is that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> same-sex marriage here and in, you know, most parts of the developed world." [...] She declared her support for same-sex marriage in August 2015.|$|E

500|$|Several of Jackson's songs {{have been}} leaked onto the Internet without gaining an {{official}} release. One example involved the song [...] "A Place with No Name", a 24-second snippet {{of which was}} leaked by website TMZ.com following Jackson's death in 2009.
