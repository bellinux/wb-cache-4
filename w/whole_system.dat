5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{dissolution}} of the Filipino Premier League, the Football Alliance sought to renew the interest of Filipinos in football. The Alliance entered into discussions with the United Football Clubs Association for the possibility of establishing another top-flight football competition in the Philippines. Instead of creating a <b>whole</b> <b>system</b> and competition, the United Football Clubs Association agreed to partner with the Football Alliance in operating the United Football League (UFL), a semi-professional league. After the league's second season, AKTV became its official TV broadcaster with the signing of a ₱150 million (~$3.3 million or ~€2.5 million), five-year deal, which ensures the airing of two live matches every week. The deal was further improved with a new TV arrangement in which four live matches would be aired every week on primetime television on AksyonTV.|$|E
40|$|Across fields, more {{sustainable}} and resilient outcomes are being realized through a <b>whole</b> <b>systems</b> design perspective, which guides decision-makers {{to consider the}} entire system affected including interdependent physical and social networks. Although infrastructure is extremely interdependent, consisting of diverse stakeholders and networks, the infrastructure design and construction process is often fragmented. This fragmentation can result in unnecessary tradeoffs, leading to poor outcomes for certain stakeholders and the surrounding environment. A <b>whole</b> <b>systems</b> design perspective would help connect this fragmented industry and lead to {{more sustainable}} outcomes. For example, a <b>whole</b> <b>systems</b> design approach to relieve traffic on a highway might see beyond the obvious, but often ineffective, response of adding a new vehicle lane to encourage a solution such as repurposing existing road lanes from automobiles to above-ground “subway” systems. This paper discusses influences to <b>whole</b> <b>systems</b> design and how intentional choice architecture, meaning the way decisions are posed, can nudge decision-makers to employ <b>whole</b> <b>systems</b> design and result in more sustainable infrastructure. By uncovering these influences and organizing them by the social, organizational, and individual levels of the infrastructure design process, this paper provides the needed foundation for interdisciplinary research to help harness these influences through choice architecture and <b>whole</b> <b>systems</b> design for the infrastructure industry...|$|R

40|$|Complementary and {{alternative}} medicine (CAM) often consists of <b>whole</b> <b>systems</b> of care (such as naturopathic medicine or traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)) that combine {{a wide range}} of modalities to provide individualised treatment. The complexity of these interventions and their potential synergistic effect requires innovative evaluative approaches. Model validity, which encompasses the need for research to adequately address the unique healing theory and therapeutic context of the intervention, is central to <b>whole</b> <b>systems</b> research (WSR). Classical randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are limited in their ability to address this need. Therefore, we propose a mixed methods approach that includes a range of relevant and holistic outcome measures. As the individual components of most <b>whole</b> <b>systems</b> are inseparable, complementary and synergistic, WSR must not focus only on the “active” ingredients of a system. An emerging WSR framework must be non-hierarchical, cyclical, flexible and adaptive, as knowledge creation is continuous, evolutionary and necessitates a continuous interplay between research methods and “phases” of knowledge. Finally, WSR must hold qualitative and quantitative research methods in equal esteem to realize their unique research contribution. <b>Whole</b> <b>systems</b> are complex and therefore no one method can adequately capture the meaning, process and outcomes of these interventions...|$|R
5|$|Ecological {{studies are}} {{necessarily}} holistic {{as opposed to}} reductionistic. Holism has three scientific meanings or uses that identify with ecology: 1) the mechanistic complexity of ecosystems, 2) the practical description of patterns in quantitative reductionist terms where correlations may be identified but nothing is understood about the causal relations {{without reference to the}} <b>whole</b> <b>system,</b> which leads to 3) a metaphysical hierarchy whereby the causal relations of larger systems are understood without reference to the smaller parts. Scientific holism differs from mysticism that has appropriated the same term. An example of metaphysical holism is identified in the trend of increased exterior thickness in shells of different species. The reason for a thickness increase can be understood through reference to principles of natural selection via predation without need to reference or understand the biomolecular properties of the exterior shells.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of January 4, 1962, the three-car automated train began service, with a ceremony. The trains carried a stand-by motorman during the six-month trial period. The train had scheduled to begin service on December 15, 1961, but Quill threatened to strike all city- and private-owned transit in the city if the train ran. Under the new contract with the TWU, the NYCTA agreed to put a motorman in the train during the experimental period. While in its experimental period, the automated train was only operating during rush hours. In July, the test was extended for three more months, and in October the test was extended for six additional months. The chairman of the NYCTA, Charles Patterson, was disappointed by the automated shuttle train, doubting that the train could be operated without any transit personnel on board. Initially, the automation of the shuttle was expected to save $150,000 a year in labor costs; however, with one employee still required on the train, there would essentially be no savings. If the test succeeded, it was planned to automate the IRT Flushing Line, the Franklin Avenue Shuttle, and the Culver Shuttle. However, the NYCTA did not have plans to automate the <b>whole</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

The major theme of the present article is that nonlinear dynamical complex systems and net-work theory provide a coherent conceptual basis and scientific approach that matches the holistic aspect of <b>whole</b> <b>systems</b> of CAM. Consequently, complex systems theory facilitates an understanding of and ability to move beyond the perplexing difficulties in repro-ducibility of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on homeopathy and other <b>whole</b> <b>systems</b> of CAM. The global and multidimensional worldviews of <b>whole</b> <b>systems</b> of CAM differ from the implicitly reductionistic and materialistic worldview of much of mainstream medicine as currently practiced, in which diagnosis and treatment focus on (a) local body parts in isolation from one another and (b) the molecular mechanisms of local symptom expression (Table 1).

Drawing from research on the mechanism responsible for circadian rhythms in mammals, I develop two examples in which mechanistic analysis is being integrated into a more holist perspective: research revealing intercellular integration of circadian mechanisms with those involved in cell metabolism and research revealing that stable␣rhythms are dependent on how individual cells in the suprachiasmatic nucleus synchronize with each other to generate regular rhythms.
