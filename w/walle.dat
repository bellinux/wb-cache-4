5|$|Trautmann {{was born}} on 22 October 1923 in <b>Walle,</b> a middle class area in west Bremen, living with his father who worked in a {{fertiliser}} factory by the docks, and his mother Frieda, a housewife. He had a brother, Karl-Heinz, three years his junior, with whom he enjoyed a close relationship. The bleak economic climate of the early 1930s forced the Trautmanns to sell their house and move to an apartment block in the working class area of Gröpelingen, where Bernhard lived until 1941.|$|E
25|$|During the 1986 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France a then record {{northern}} hemisphere crowd of 50,383 attended {{the first test}} of the Ashes series at Old Trafford with the <b>Walle</b> Lewis led Australians winning 38–16. On 16 December 1986 the Kangaroos set a new record for largest-ever winning margin in a Test match at 52–0 against France. In their two Tests against France, the Australians ran in 96 points and conceded just a single penalty goal. After suffering such heavy losses, France decided to call off their proposed 1987 tour of Australia. This became the second consecutive tour of Europe in which Australia had won all their games. By {{the end of the}} tour, Terry Lamb had become the first player to appear in every match on a Kangaroo Tour. For this tour Wally Lewis, Greg Dowling, Bob Lindner, Gene Miles (Wynnum Manly) and Bryan Neibling (Redcliffe) became the last players selected to tour from the Brisbane Rugby League competition. By being named as tour captain, Wally Lewis became the first Queenslander to captain a Kangaroo Tour since Tom Gorman in 1929/30.|$|E

2500|$|During this time, {{the city}} {{experienced}} serious {{changes in the}} structure and construction of the town. Centuries-old defensive walls were dismantled, replaced by garden plots. It was felt that one no longer need fear cannon fire, even without walls. On July 1, 1808, Goethe's mother wrote to her son Wolfgang: [...] "Die alten <b>Wälle</b> sind abgetragen, die alten Tore eingerissen, um die ganze Stadt ein Park." [...] (The old barriers are levelled, the old gates torn down, around the whole city a park.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Professor Étienne Van de <b>Walle</b> gave a {{slightly}} later date, writing that [...] "The {{formation of the}} Sereer ethnicity {{goes back to the}} thirteenth century, when a group came from the Senegal River valley in the north fleeing Islam, and near Niakhar met another group of Mandinka origin, called the Gelwar, who were coming from the southeast (Gravrand 1983). The actual Sereer ethnic group is a mixture of the two groups, and this may explain their complex bilinear kinship system".|$|E
2500|$|The terrace {{and garden}} were {{constructed}} in 1736 shortly after Walpole moved into Number 10. The terrace, extending across the back, provides a {{full view of}} St James's Park. The garden is dominated by an open lawn of [...] that wraps around Numbers 10 and 11 in an L-shape. No longer [...] "fitted with variety <b>Walle</b> fruit and diverse fruit trees" [...] {{as it was in}} the 17th century, there is now a centrally located flower bed around a holly tree surrounded by seats. Tubs of flowers line the steps from the terrace; around the walls are rose beds with flowering and evergreen shrubs. (See North elevation of Number 10 with steps leading to the garden) The terrace and garden have provided a casual setting for many gatherings of First Lords with foreign dignitaries, Cabinet ministers, guests, and staff. Prime Minister Tony Blair, for example, hosted a farewell reception in 2007 for his staff on the terrace. John Major announced his 1995 resignation as leader of the Conservative Party in the garden. Churchill called his secretaries the [...] "garden girls" [...] because their offices overlook the garden. It was also the location of the first press conference announcing the Coalition Government between David Cameron's Conservatives and Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats.|$|E

50|$|<b>Walles</b> {{works on}} {{regenerative}} medicine and tissue engineering research. Being a thoracic surgeon, {{he focused on}} the generation of bioartificial airway tissues for tracheo-bronchial replacement. His work resulted in the first clinical applications of bioartifical tissues for airway reconstruction. In their follow-up of these first transplanted patients <b>Walles</b> and his coworkers demonstrated a post-transplant tissue-maturation process of the bioartificial tissues. Pioneering the translation of bioartifical human tissues into clinical applications, he dealt with the legal framework for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine in Germany and Europe. As a specialist in lung cancer treatment <b>Walles</b> could also demonstrate that lung cancer can be detected in the patients' breath. The objective of his ongoing research {{is the development of}} technical devices for lung cancer screening.|$|R
