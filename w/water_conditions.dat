The modifications of Al 6 Cu by adding Mg of 0. 5 to 2 % in the interval of 0. 5 % mixing with stirrer and casted by gravity sand casting. The effect of Mg and unidirectional cooling on microstructure was studied by using optical microscope.

40|$|To {{clarify the}} factors {{controlling}} {{temporal and spatial}} variations of soil carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), methane (CH 4 ), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) fluxes, we investigated these gas fluxes and environmental factors in a tropical rainforest in Peninsular Malaysia. Temporal variation of CO 2 flux in a 2 -ha plot {{was positively related to}} soil <b>water</b> <b>condition</b> and rainfall history. Spatially, CO 2 flux was negatively related to soil <b>water</b> <b>condition.</b> When CO 2 flux hotspots were included, no other environmental factors such as soil C or N concentrations showed any significant correlation. Although the larger area sampled in the present study complicates explanations of spatial variation of CO 2 flux, our results support a previously reported bipolar relationship between the temporal and spatial patterns of CO 2 flux and soil <b>water</b> <b>condition</b> observed at the study site in a smaller study plot. Flux of CH 4 was usually negative with little variation, resulting in the soil at our study site functioning as a CH 4 sink. Both temporal and spatial variations of CH 4 flux were positively related to the soil <b>water</b> <b>condition.</b> Soil N concentration was also related to the spatial distribution of CH 4 flux. Some hotspots were observed, probably due to CH 4 production by termites, and these hotspots obscured the relationship between both temporal and spatial variations of CH 4 flux and environmental factors. Temporal variation of N 2 O flux and soil N 2 O concentration was large and significantly related to the soil <b>water</b> <b>condition,</b> or in a strict sense, to rainfall history. Thus, the rainfall pattern controlled wet season N 2 O production in soil and its soil surface flux. Spatially, large N 2 O emissions were detected in wet periods at wetter and anaerobic locations, and were thus determined by soil physical properties. Our results showed that, even in Southeast Asian rainforests where distinct dry and wet seasons do not exist, variation in the soil <b>water</b> <b>condition</b> related to rainfall history controlled the temporal variations of soil CO 2 flux, CH 4 uptake, and N 2 O emission. The soil <b>water</b> <b>condition</b> associated with soil hydraulic properties was also the important controlling factor of the spatial distributions of these gas fluxes...|$|R

Reproductive (R) females responded with larger amplitude EOGs to <b>water</b> <b>conditioned</b> by (R) males compared with non-reproductive (NR) males. The R females reacted by directed movement to <b>water</b> <b>conditioned</b> by R males compared to untreated water, but not to water from NR males or females.

The risks of dying during recreational, scientific or commercial diving are small, and for scuba diving, deaths are usually associated with poor gas management, poor buoyancy control, equipment misuse, entrapment, rough <b>water</b> <b>conditions</b> and pre-existing health problems. Some fatalities are inevitable and caused by unforeseeable situations escalating out of control, but the majority of diving fatalities can be attributed to human error {{on the part of the}} victim.

5|$|Shark {{eyes are}} similar to the eyes of other vertebrates, {{including}} similar lenses, corneas and retinas, though their eyesight is well adapted to the marine environment {{with the help of a}} tissue called tapetum lucidum. This tissue is behind the retina and reflects light back to it, thereby increasing visibility in the dark waters. The effectiveness of the tissue varies, with some sharks having stronger nocturnal adaptations. Many sharks can contract and dilate their pupils, like humans, something no teleost fish can do. Sharks have eyelids, but they do not blink because the surrounding water cleans their eyes. To protect their eyes some species have nictitating membranes. This membrane covers the eyes while hunting and when the shark is being attacked. However, some species, including the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), do not have this membrane, but instead roll their eyes backwards to protect them when striking prey. The importance of sight in shark hunting behavior is debated. Some believe that electro- and chemoreception are more significant, while others point to the nictating membrane as evidence that sight is important. Presumably, the shark would not protect its eyes were they unimportant. The use of sight probably varies with species and <b>water</b> <b>conditions.</b> The shark's field of vision can swap between monocular and stereoscopic at any time. A micro-spectrophotometry study of 17 species of shark found 10 had only rod photoreceptors and no cone cells in their retinas giving them good night vision while making them colorblind. The remaining seven species had in addition to rods a single type of cone photoreceptor sensitive to green and, seeing only in shades of grey and green, are believed to be effectively colorblind. The study indicates that an object's contrast against the background, rather than colour, may be more important for object detection.|$|E

Intermitten irrigation system shows able to suppress CH 4 emission 56. 34 %, while saturated <b>water</b> <b>condition</b> system is 54. 61 %. Type of soil cultivation also affects the CH 4 emission.
