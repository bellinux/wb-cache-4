40|$|It is axiomatic {{that man}} {{requires}} an adequate arterial pressure to maintain tissue perfusion. However, {{diseases of the}} circulation are observed more frequently in subjects at {{the upper end of}} <b>what</b> <b>is</b> a <b>normal</b> <b>distribution</b> of pressures: thus the association between hypertension and cardio-vascular morbidity and mortality is real [1]. Indeed, available data suggest that there is a linear increase in mortality with increasing systolic and diastolic pressures above 110 / 70 mm Hg. Whilst it has been known for some time that treatment of the most severe hypertension prolongs life, it is only comparatively recently that the results have appeared of offering treatment to patients with milder degrees of the disease [2]. The data have pleased and disappointed: decreasing diastolic arterial pressures in the range 90 - 115 mm Hg has produced a clear reduction in cerebrovascular accidents, but had virtually no impact upon myocardial infarction, and yet coronary events are the commonest complication of mild hyper-tension. In addition, perhaps predictably, greater benefit accrued from treating patients with sus-tained diastolic arterial pressures of 100 mm Hg or greater. Even at this arbitrary point in the arterial pressure distribution curve, the economic consequences of treating every adult denned thus would be alarming, assuming that all such indi-viduals were detected; such financial implications become unthinkable if the cut-off point is reset at 90 mm Hg, with an estimated 25 % of the adult population of the U. K. then falling into the potential group needing therapy. At this level, the benefit to an individual is small and possibly out-weighed by risks of taking pharmacological agents.
