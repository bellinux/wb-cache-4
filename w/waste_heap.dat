5|$|For a {{fortunate}} few though fortunes {{could be}} won 'with a rapidity only equalled by the princely gains {{of some of}} the adventurers who accompanied Pizarro to Peru', noted one observer. Among the most notable success stories were the six sons of Coatbridge farmer Alexander Baird. The Baird family had become involved in coal mining but opened an iron foundry in order to exploit the new hot blast process of iron smelting invented by James Beaumont Neilson. The Baird's subsequently constructed numerous iron foundries in Coatbridge including the famous Gartsherrie iron works. The <b>waste</b> <b>heap</b> or 'bing' from the Baird's Gartsherrie works was said to be as large as the great pyramid in Egypt. One son, James Baird, was responsible for erecting sixteen blast-furnaces in Coatbridge between 1830 and 1842. Each of the six sons of Alexander Baird was reputed to have become a millionaire.|$|E

The remains of a smithy were found lower down, near the base of the middle collapse hole, where there was a flat area at 584metres AOD, with the foundations of a building and a scattering of coal, coke, slag and iron. Gilgower's level was identified with a <b>waste</b> <b>heap</b> and entrance cutting at 582metres AOD. Below this was evidence of another level, driven at an elevation of 572metres AOD.

This level was not shown on the mine plan of 1853, and Murphy named it the Hush Level. A shallow water channel ran from its mouth and seemed to have drained the mine for a considerable time. The earliest Ordnance Survey map of the area, the 1861 map of Westmorland at a scale of 1:2,500, shows two mine levels, corresponding to Gilgower's Level and the Hush Level.

50|$|Leafcutter ants {{have very}} {{specific}} roles in {{taking care of}} the fungal garden and dumping the refuse. Waste management is a key role for each colony's longevity. The necrotrophic parasitic fungus Escovopsis threatens the ants' food source and thus is a constant danger to the ants. The waste transporters and waste-heap workers are the older, more dispensable leafcutter ants, ensuring the healthier and younger ants can work on the fungal garden. The Atta colombica species, unusually for the Attine tribe, have an external <b>waste</b> <b>heap.</b> Waste transporters take the waste, which consists of used substrate and discarded fungus, to the <b>waste</b> <b>heap.</b> Once dropped off at the refuse dump, the heap workers organise the waste and constantly shuffle it around to aid decomposition.

40|$|Mining {{spoil heaps}} {{are common in}} coal-mining areas. A little-known fact {{that has not yet}} {{attracted}} much public attention is the phenomenon of smouldering inside heaps. The energetic utilization of smouldering <b>waste</b> <b>heaps</b> is being investigated as part of a joint research project funded by the BMBF. Three borehole heat exchangers were installed in a spoil heap in the western Ruhr. It can be shown that the flow temperatures and thus the achievable heat extraction rate are much higher than in conventional geothermal systems. In order to determine the thermal and physical properties of the mining materials, several field and laboratory tests were performed.

30|$|The {{materials}} from <b>waste</b> <b>heaps</b> were previously analyzed and reported as displaying very {{high concentrations of}} radionuclides, in particular at Vale da Arca mine with 28000  Bq/kg of 238 U, 26000  Bq/kg of 226 Ra, and 16000  Bq/kg of 210 Po, while the <b>waste</b> <b>heaps</b> of Bica Mine displayed concentrations of 9000, 18000, and 7800  Bq/kg for the same radionuclides, respectively [11]. For comparison, the soil of an agriculture plot of this region contained concentrations (already relatively high) of 750, 800 and 550  Bq/kg for the same radionuclides, respectively [11]. Taking into account that those uranium waste piles contain amounts estimated at about (2 – 3) ×  106  m 3 at Vale de Arca and (3 – 5) ×  106  m 3 at Bica mine sites, if left uncovered, they have a large potential to contaminate surface water streams through continued radionuclide leaching and transport of particulate material by surface runoff.

A total of around 90% of the <b>waste</b> <b>heap</b> have been examined. The findings include a total of 217,000 stone artefacts of various sizes. There are also 479 kg of bones (plus 235 kg of burned bones), mostly from hunted animals.

40|$|Abandoned tailing basins and <b>waste</b> <b>heaps</b> of orphan mining {{sites are}} {{of great concern}} since extreme metal {{contamination}} makes soil improper for any human activity and is a permanent threat for nearby surroundings. Although spontaneous revegetation can occur, the process is slow or unsuccessful and rhizostabilisation strategies to reduce dispersal of contaminated dust represent an option to rehabilitate such sites. This requires selection of plants tolerant to such conditions, and optimization of their fitness and growth. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can enhance metal tolerance in moderately polluted soils, but their ability to survive extreme levels of metal contamination has not been reported. This question was addressed in the tailing basin and nearby <b>waste</b> <b>heaps</b> of an orphan mining site in southern France, reaching in the tailing basin exceptionally high contents of zinc (ppm: 97, 333 total) and lead (ppm: 31, 333 total). In order {{to contribute to a}} better understanding of AMF ecology under severe abiotic stress and to identify AMF associated with plants growing under such conditions, that may be considered in future revegetation and rhizostabilisation of highly polluted areas, nine plant species were sampled at different growing seasons and AMF root colonization was determined. Glomeromycota diversity was monitored in mycorrhizal roots by sequencing of the ribosomal LSU. This first survey of AMF in such highly contaminated soils revealed the presence of several AMF ribotypes, belonging mainly to the Glomerales, with some examples from the Paraglomerales and Diversisporales. AMF diversity and root colonization in the tailing basin were lower than in the less-contaminated <b>waste</b> <b>heaps.</b> A Paraglomus species previously identified in a polish mining site was common in roots of different plants. Presence of active AMF in such an environment is an outstanding finding, which should be clearly considered for the design of efficient rhizostabilisation processes...|$|R
50|$|Foundations and {{remnants}} of four early mines occur along the north- south {{line of the}} Hampden reef. Northern-most is the Hampden No. 2 containing a multi-tube boiler, beam pump and waster material. Logs remain at the former sawmill site south of Hampden No. 2. Further south and about 200m east of the smelter is the Hampden No.1 mine and plant foundations {{at the base of}} a high tailings dump. This mine contains the largest group of foundations including crusher and winch mounts. A beam pump arm is located at the collar of the main shaft. Further south, at the Hampden No. 3 shaft, remains include a headframe, winder house, <b>waste</b> <b>heaps</b> and boiler on a brick mounting. The bricks are manufactured from slag demonstrating an innovative and rare use of recycled slag. The Hampden Consol mine to the south retains an iron chimney on a rendered brick base which is inscribed AD 1913. Evidence at the site includes engine house remains, foundations and <b>waste</b> <b>heaps.</b> Other shafts and underground operations are likely to remain where there is the existence of shafts and levels. These remnants are likely to provide useful information on tunnelling techniques, the use of pit props, and design of ore hauling mechanisms.|$|R
