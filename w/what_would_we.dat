2500|$|PAUL: I believe very {{sincerely}} {{that the}} CIA is correct when they teach {{and talk about}} blowback. When we went into Iran in 1953 and installed the Shah, yes there was blowback. The reaction to that was the taking of our hostages, and that persists. And if we ignore that, we ignore that at our own risk. If {{we think we can}} do what we want around the world and not incite hatred, then we have a problem. They don't come here to attack us because we're rich and we're free, they come and attack us because we're over there. I mean <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>we</b> think if other foreign countries were doing that to us? ...|$|E
2500|$|PAUL: No, {{non-intervention}} {{was a major}} contributing factor. Have {{you ever}} read about the reasons they attacked us? They attack us because we've been over there. We've been bombing Iraq for ten years. We've been in the Middle East [...] I think [...] Reagan was right. We don't understand the irrationality of Middle Eastern politics. Right now, we're building an embassy in Iraq that is bigger than the Vatican. We're building 14 permanent bases. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>we</b> say here if China was doing this in our country or in the Gulf of Mexico? We would be objecting. We {{need to look at}} what we do, {{from the point of view}} of what it would be like if someone did it to us.|$|E
