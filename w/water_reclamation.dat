50|$|Sweet <b>Water's</b> <b>reclamation</b> and {{revitalization}} {{projects were}} inspired by former basketball player and MacArthur Foundation Genius Grant-winner Will Allen. The farm was situated in a formerly abandoned 6.5 acre building complex and utilized four 11,000 gallon raceways dug directly into the concrete floor to house the fish. Expansions to the facility were {{to be paid for}} in part by a $250,000 loan from the City of Milwaukee that would have been entirely forgiven if it had created 45 jobs by the end of 2014. When Sweet Water folded, it was unable to pay back its loans.|$|R

25|$|Most of {{the uses}} of <b>water</b> <b>reclamation</b> are non potable uses such as: washing cars, {{flushing}} toilets, cooling water for power plants, concrete mixing, artificial lakes, irrigation for golf courses and public parks, and for hydraulic fracturing. Where applicable, systems run a dual piping system to keep the recycled water separate from the potable water.|$|E
25|$|Until 2010, {{wastewater}} in Singapore {{was collected}} through a sewer system that included 139 pumping stations that pumped water to six wastewater treatment plants.

25|$|Most of the NEWater {{is used by}} {{industries}} for non-potable uses such as wafer fabrication. The rest is {{fed into}} nearby reservoirs. As of 2008, according to PUB NEWater was able to meet 30% of Singapore's water requirements. The high purity of the water has actually allowed industries to reduce their costs. With {{the construction of the}} Deep Tunnel Sewerage System the decentralized <b>water</b> <b>reclamation</b> plants and NEWater factories are expected to be gradually closed and replaced by the single, much larger <b>water</b> <b>reclamation</b> plant and NEWater factory at Changi at the Eastern end of Singapore Island. The Bedok reclamation plant {{was the first one to}} be decommissioned in 2009, followed by the Seletar plant in 2011. The Bedok NEWater plant, however, continued to operate, while the Seletar NEWater plant was decommissioned along with the reclamation plant. The Kranji, Ulu Pandan and Bedok reclamation plants had been upgraded in 1999-2001, making them more compact so that they needed less land and covering them for odor control in order to make nearby land more valuable.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} direct potable reuse {{is the case}} of Windhoek (Namibia, New Goreangab <b>Water</b> <b>Reclamation</b> Plant (NGWRP)), where treated {{wastewater}} has been blended with drinking water for more than 40 years. It is based on the multiple treatment barriers concept (i.e. pre-ozonation, enhanced coagulation/dissolved air flotation/rapid sand filtration, and subsequent ozone, biological activated carbon/granular activated carbon, ultrafiltration (UF), chlorination) to reduce associated risks and improve the water quality. The reclaimed wastewater nowadays represent about 14% of the city’s drinking water production.|$|E
25|$|Large-scale urban UV {{wastewater}} treatment is performed in {{cities such as}} Edmonton, Alberta. The use of ultraviolet light has now become standard practice in most municipal {{wastewater treatment}} processes. Effluent is now starting to be recognized as a valuable resource, not a problem that needs to be dumped. Many wastewater facilities are being renamed as <b>water</b> <b>reclamation</b> facilities, whether the wastewater is discharged into a river, used to irrigate crops, or injected into an aquifer for later recovery. Ultraviolet light is now being used to ensure water is free from harmful organisms.|$|E

25|$|On the station, {{the crews}} {{continued}} to work on transfer operations, and continued work on the <b>water</b> <b>reclamation</b> system. During the Mission Status Briefing, lead ISS Flight Director Ginger Kerrick noted that a sample {{was taken from the}} Water Processor Assembly that contained 10% urine and 90% condensate, and would be returned to the ground with the shuttle. Kerrick noted that if activation of the system continued on schedule, a sample from the potable water dispenser would be taken on flight day eleven. The ground crew continued to troubleshoot the Urine Processor Assembly, looking at whether there is a sensor touching part of the system’s centrifuge as it rotates, which might be causing it to slow down.|$|E
25|$|The same report {{noted that}} the low Great Lakes levels were drought-induced, caused by a very hot, dry summer {{and a lack of}} a solid snowpack in the winter of 2012. At the time of the report, December 2012, Lake Michigan-Huron was 28 inches below its {{long-term}} average which is near the record lows of 1964. Historic lake levels for Lake Michigan reported from 1918 to 1998 show that the low levels observed in 1964 were the lowest since 1918. In 2012 Lake Michigan-Huron’s seasonal rise was about 4 inches where it usually is about 12 inches. Normally the Chicago River water level is two feet lower than the lake and therefore does not flow into the lake. If the lake level falls too low threatening to reverse the river flow, the Metropolitan <b>Water</b> <b>Reclamation</b> District of Greater Chicago would be forced to close locks between the lake and river {{for longer periods of time}} limiting navigation. A reversal flow of the Chicago River into Lake Michigan would have a negative impact on navigation and on the quality of Lake Michigan water which is the source of drinking water. Chicago's raw sewage in the river is normally carried upstream toward the Mississippi River which flows south towards the Gulf of Mexico. On January 9, 2013 Chicago meteorologists announced 320 days without at least one inch of snowfall. Water levels in the lake started to level off with the river and sewage was visible at the cusp of the locks, just a few hundred feet from Lake Michigan. David St. Pierre, executive director of the Metropolitan <b>Water</b> <b>Reclamation</b> District of Greater Chicago warned the low lake levels were nearing a point of real concern. However, the District maintains that it is not possible for the River to reverse due to low lake level alone.|$|E
25|$|STS-126 {{included}} the Leonardo Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) on its fifth spaceflight. Leonardo held over 14,000 pounds of supplies and equipment. Among the items {{packed into the}} MPLM were two new crew quarters racks, a second galley (kitchen) for the Destiny laboratory, a second Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC) rack (lavatory), the advanced Resistive Exercise Device (aRED), two <b>water</b> <b>reclamation</b> racks, spare hardware, and new experiments. Also included in Leonardo was the General Laboratory Active Cryogenic ISS Experiment Refrigerator, or GLACIER, a double locker cryogenic freezer for transporting and preserving science experiments.

40|$|Rapid {{development}} {{during the}} past two decades has dramatically increased water demand in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a country with limited potable water supplies. To meet this increased demand, both the government and private sectors have invested heavily in developing new and alternative sources of supply as well as forms of treatment. This article examines two processes - desalination of seawater and brackish <b>water</b> and <b>reclamation</b> of domestic wastewater - that are used extensively in Saudi Arabia to stretch its less-than-optimal supplies. Some of the major reverse osmosis installations are described, in terms of source- and product-water characteristics, plant performance, and cost...|$|R
25|$|Singapore has {{traditionally}} relied on water from Malaysia. However, this reliance has made Singapore {{subject to the}} possibility of price increases and allowed Malaysian officials to use the water reliance as a political leverage by threatening to cut off supply. In order to reduce this problem, Lee decided to experiment with water recycling in 1974. However, the water treatment plant was closed in 1975 due to cost and reliability issues. In 1998, the Public Utilities Board (PUB) and the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) initiated the Singapore <b>Water</b> <b>Reclamation</b> Study (NEWater Study). The aim was to determine if NEWater was a viable source of raw water for Singapore's needs. In 2001, PUB initiated efforts to increase water supplies for non-potable use. Using NEWater for these would help reduce the demand on the reservoirs for potable water.|$|E
25|$|Laguna Beach is {{the tenth}} {{official}} Transition Town in the U.S. In February 2007, Laguna's city council unanimously voted {{to join the}} U.S. Mayors Climate Initiative, and in April, 2013 became the first Orange County city to request formally that the San Onofre Nuclear Reactor not be restarted after its January 2012 shut down. The Aliso Creek <b>Water</b> <b>Reclamation</b> Facility went into operation in 2014. It removes polluted runoff in Aliso Creek, improves ocean water quality, and creates local recycled water. With a grant from Cal Trans, the city is undertaking a transition plan to implement Complete Streets for all users. A North-South bicycle route with signs and sharrows was completed through town in 2014. Laguna Beach passed a city-wide 'Idaho Stop' for cyclist, a no plastic bag ordinance and a no plastic bottle purchasing policy for its government.|$|E
25|$|The Lopez-De La Cruz {{family were}} members of the National Land for People; an {{organization}} founded by former UFW photographer George Ballis that sought out ways to break up large agricultural holdings into small family farms. They believed that when “land was held narrowly, freedom withers,” and they were critical of the system of large growers profiting off bargain priced water provided by the government while small family farms and co-ops struggled to get the water they needed. The National Land for People advocated <b>water</b> <b>reclamation</b> and the enforcement of The Reclamation Act of 1902 and pesticide free farming. According to The Reclamation Act of 1902, farmers may not obtain more than 160 acres of federally subsidized water. Their leader created a 23-minute film titled The Richest Land that juxtaposed small farmers and corporate farmers, and Jessie Lopez De La Cruz and Delores Huerta both made cameos. On July 17, 1974 Lopez-De La Cruz found herself again on the political stage, speaking to the US Senate before the Select Committee on Small Business; she shared her life story and asked for the Senators to come to Fresno to listen to the needs of poor farm workers. Again in 1976, the National Land for People made its way to Washington to challenge congressional leaders to enforce water rights laws.|$|E
