40|$|International audienceWi-Fi {{tracking}} is {{a method}} relying on signals emitted by portable devices to track individuals for commercial, security or surveillance purposes. Wi-Fi tracking {{has the potential to}} passively track a large fraction of the population [12] and is therefore an ideal population surveillance technology and a serious privacy threat. We argue that <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>routers</b> make an ideal building block to create a large scale Wi-Fi tracking system. This paper first presents the interesting features of <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>routers</b> for tracking and describes how they can be easily turned into Wi-Fi tracking devices through software modification. We then introduce the concept of a large scale Wi-Fi tracking system based on routers and we propose a design for such a system, including stealth communications and deployment. Finally we provide a first evaluation of the tracking capabilities of an hypothetical Wi-Fi tracking system through a set of simulations based on real-world datasets. Results show that the spatial distribution of <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>routers</b> is such that compromising even a small fraction of <b>Wi-Fi</b> <b>routers</b> is sufficient to track people for a large fraction of the time...|$|R
