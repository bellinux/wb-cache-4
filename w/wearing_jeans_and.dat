500|$|In 1941 Anderson {{completed}} her PhD at the University of Wisconsin, writing her thesis on [...] "Low energy {{levels in the}} atomic spectra Co VII and Ni VIII". Immediately after finishing her PhD, Anderson requested time off from her position at Milwaukee-Downer College, in order to conduct war research related to the Manhattan Project at the Office of Scientific Research and Development at Princeton University. Not long after, Anderson was recruited to continue her work specifically at Los Alamos Laboratory. At her new location, Anderson studied basic fission parameters, including analyzing the time delays associated with the absorption and emission of neutrons. [...] Such work often entailed working upwards of sixteen hours a day. [...] Among other accomplishments at Los Alamos, Anderson prepared the first sample of pure uranium-235 at the laboratory. While there, {{she lived in a}} dormitory, and being older than most of the other residents (she was aged fifty), she was put in charge. She often worked at night, <b>wearing</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> a plaid shirt– not the usual attire for a woman at the time.|$|E

500|$|After {{the tournament}} ended, Moon was congratulated by {{professional}} poker player Phil Hellmuth, who said, [...] "I'm proud of you, Darvin." [...] Some were critical of both Moon and Cada. Mike Matusow, a professional poker player {{with a reputation}} for trash-talking, called the heads-up contest between the two [...] "a new low for poker as a skilled game". Storms Reback, of All In Magazine, said Moon was [...] "out of his league" [...] at the tournament, and made a number of questionable calls and bets. As an example, Reback cited a hand in which Moon attempted to bluff by re-raising a bet by Begleiter for 15 million chips, then folding when Begleiter went all in for an additional 6 million, even though Moon was getting better than 7-to-1 odds on his money. Moon said he planned to spend some of his World Series winnings on putting relatives through college and charitable contributions to his home town, including a new youth ball field and recreation center. Moon said of his victory, [...] "We ain't gonna change. The next time you see us, we'll be <b>wearing</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> everything else, like we always have." ...|$|E
500|$|Susie Bright {{described}} {{some of the}} specifically lesbian {{themes of}} the film. One {{is the concept of}} the hand as a sex organ, highlighted by lingering camera shots of Corky and Violet's hands. Another is the repeated use of water as a symbolic motif to represent women, present for example when Corky is retrieving Violet's earring from the sink. Bright describes it as a movie that is [...] "wet" [...] (feminine) as opposed to [...] "hard" [...] (masculine). She says the scene where Corky and Violet have their first conversation is full of [...] "lesbian signs". She highlights the fact that Violet, away from Caesar, is <b>wearing</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> able to be less overtly feminine. Jennifer Tilly says that whenever Violet is talking to men, her voice becomes high-pitched and [...] "girly"—making her seem vulnerable and ensuring she is taken care of. Joe Pantoliano agrees, saying that the result is that [...] "everyone in the film wants to be with Violet". When she is with Corky, Violet can drop the act and talk at a more natural pitch. According to Bright, the more subtle lesbian themes of the film were noticed and appreciated at the LGBT film festival screenings.|$|E

2500|$|This was {{reflected}} in ongoing debate over the propriety of butch and femme dress and role play among its members. As early as 1955 a rule was made that women who attended meetings, if wearing pants, should be wearing women's slacks. However, many women remember it being a rule that went unfollowed as attendees at many meetings were <b>wearing</b> <b>jeans,</b> <b>and</b> the only jeans available in the 1950s were men's. Barbara Gittings recalled years later of an instance when, {{in preparation for a}} national convention, members of the DOB persuaded a woman who had worn men's clothing all her life, [...] "to deck herself out in as 'feminine' a manner as she could...Everyone rejoiced over this as though some great victory had been accomplished...Today we would be horrified at anyone who thought this kind of evangelism had a legitimate purpose." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bob's Discount Furniture {{is widely}} {{recognized}} for its idiosyncratic advertising. Bob Kaufman {{has been characterized}} as [...] "something of a celebrity in the Northeast, thanks to his quirky television commercials". As of 1997, the company broadcast roughly 500 commercials a week in Connecticut on network and cable television stations. More recently, the commercials have become common during broadcasts of Boston Red Sox and New York Mets games. The commercials usually feature company president Bob Kaufman, typically <b>wearing</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> a golf shirt or turtleneck, and have also included Bob's Discount Furniture employees. Cathy Poulin, the company's Director of Public Relations, is the female face of the company. [...] Cathy has been publicly criticized, however, for her contrasting style of dress. [...] Cathy appears in commercials and at events both with and without Bob. [...] "Spanish Bob" [...] William Newton appears in Bob's Discount Furniture commercials for Spanish language stations associated with Univision, Telemundo or other networks. [...] "Clay Bob" [...] has frequent appearances in the company's commercials, often providing seasonal advertisements. The commercials have been characterized as [...] "amateurish", [...] "unconventional", and [...] "wacky", and viewer reaction to the commercials is mixed, with some disliking the advertisements. The advertisements often feature catchphrases, including [...] "Gotcha!", [...] "Untouchable!", [...] "Lickety-split delivery!", [...] "It's a no-brainer!", and most famous (in Bob's early years), [...] "Come on down!".|$|E
2500|$|In Rome in 1992, a 45-year-old driving {{instructor}} {{was accused of}} rape. When he picked up an 18-year-old girl for her first driving lesson, he allegedly raped her for an hour, then told {{her that if she}} was to tell anyone he would kill her. Later that night she told her parents and her parents agreed to help her press charges. While the alleged rapist was convicted and sentenced, the Italian Supreme Court overturned the conviction in 1998 because the victim wore tight jeans. It was argued that she must have necessarily have had to help her attacker remove her jeans, thus making the act consensual ("because the victim wore very, very tight jeans, she had to help him remove them...and by removing the jeans...it was no longer rape but consensual sex"). [...] The Italian Supreme Court stated in its decision “it is a fact of common experience that it is nearly impossible to slip off tight jeans even partly without the active collaboration of the person who is wearing them.” This ruling sparked widespread feminist protest. The day after the decision, women in the Italian Parliament protested by <b>wearing</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> holding placards that read “Jeans: An Alibi for Rape.” As a sign of support, the California Senate and Assembly followed suit. Soon Patricia Giggans, Executive Director of the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women, (now Peace Over Violence) made Denim Day an annual event. As of 2011 at least 20 U.S. states officially recognize Denim Day in April. Wearing jeans on this day has become an international symbol of protest. As of 2008 the Italian Supreme Court has overturned their findings, and {{there is no longer a}} [...] "denim" [...] defense to the charge of rape.|$|E

50|$|Although {{respected}} for her {{abilities and}} lineage, Makobo {{was seen as}} too modern {{to be the next}} Rain Queen, which may have been why there was such a long delay before she was crowned.

In the 2002 production, the stage was described by one critic as a “bare blank design” with “no relation to domestic realism.” [...] The costumes of the play were as simple as the stage design.
