Most players never played large maps, while a subset greatly enjoyed 16-player action via four networked consoles. [...] "We looked at the small set of fans {{who were able to}} do this," [...] said engineering lead Chris Butcher, [...] "and just how much they were enjoying themselves, and asked ourselves if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> that to everybody.

500|$|... "Da Funk" [...] and [...] "Alive" [...] {{were later}} {{included}} on Daft Punk's 1997 debut album Homework. In February of that year, the UK dance magazine Muzik published a Daft Punk cover feature and described Homework as [...] "one {{of the most}} hyped debut albums in a long long time." [...] According to The Village Voice, the album revived house music and departed from the Eurodance formula. As noted by critic Alex Rayner, Homework brought together established club styles and the [...] "burgeoning eclecticism" [...] of big beat. In 1997 Daft Punk also launched their Daftendirektour to promote Homework in several cities throughout the world. For this tour the duo opted to utilize their home studio equipment for the live stage. As Bangalter stated, [...] "Everything was synched up—the drum machines, the bass lines. The sequencer was just sending out the tempos and controlling the beats and bars. On top of this structure we built all these layers of samples and various parts that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> in whenever we wanted to."

[...] Carey also added that the song was written around the time her friend, singer Whitney Houston, had died. [...] "'We were actually in the hospital together when we saw it on TV.' It was important for me to write something that would...help me get through the moment. That’s where ‘Stay triumphant, keep on living’ came from." [...] Carey also expressed why she chosen Ross and Mill, or any hip-hop artist in general on the track, claiming that they are [...] "different" [...] and how she is always experimenting on collaborations with varying and new artists. When asked why she chose not to release a lead single which was dance influenced, Carey explained how she felt regarding the current music scene; [...] "I think it would be incredible if <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>bring</b> back the days when R records didn't have to cross over but be massive hits on their own," [...] and that was the reason why {{she did not want to}} conform to what is currently on trend. Additionally, she felt that [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)", potentially, would be able to generate cross-appeal, and not only cater Mainstream Top 40. With specific emphasis on the dance music scene and its popularity, Carey stated that while she was pregnant, the vast majority of music that was being released was dance and electronic music, saying [...] "I was pregnant forever, and I was being tortured day and night by techno music. I was complaining to everyone who was listening. One time I made dinner for L.A. Reid, and we were both sitting there like 'What happened? It saddened Carey that R and hip-hop music was being [...] "bowled over" [...] by dance music, and therefore wanted to remain true to herself by making traditional R music: ...|$|E
