500|$|Olga Kurylenko as Camille Montes, a Bolivian {{agent with}} her own vendetta {{regarding}} Greene and Medrano. Forster chose her because out of the 400 women who auditioned, she seemed the least nervous. When she read the script, she <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> had no love scene with Craig; she felt it would have distracted viewers from her performance. Kurylenko spent three weeks training to fight with weapons, and she learnt a form of indoor skydiving known as body flying. Kurylenko {{said she had to}} do [...] "training non-stop from the morning to the evening" [...] for the action scenes, overcoming her fears with the help of Craig and the stunt team. She was given a DVD box set of Bond films, since the franchise was not easily available to watch in her native Ukraine. Kurylenko found Michelle Yeoh in Tomorrow Never Dies inspiring [...] "because she did the fight scenes by herself." [...] The producers had intended to cast a South American actress in the role. Kurylenko trained with a dialect coach to perform with a Spanish accent. She said that the accent was easy for her because she has [...] "a lot of hispanic friends, from Latin America and Spain, and it's an accent I've always heard". When reflecting on her experience as a Bond girl, she stated she was proudest of overcoming her fears in performing stunts.|$|E
500|$|Margaret Eagar {{also noted}} that Olga was bright but said she had little {{experience}} with the world because of her sheltered life. She and her sisters had little understanding of money because they had not {{had an opportunity to}} shop in stores or to see money exchange hands. Young Olga once thought that a hat maker who came to the palace had given her a new hat as a present. Olga was once frightened when she witnessed a policeman arresting someone on the street. She thought the policeman would come to arrest her because she had behaved badly for Miss Eagar. When reading a history lesson, she remarked that she <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> lived in current times, when people were good and not as evil as they had been in the past. When she was eight, in November 1903, Olga learned about death first hand when her first cousin, Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine, died of typhoid fever while on a visit to the Romanovs at their Polish estate. [...] "My children talked much of cousin Ella and how God had taken her spirit, and they understood that later God would take her body also to heaven", wrote Eagar. [...] "On Christmas morning when Olga awoke, she exclaimed at once, 'Did God send for cousin Ella's body in the night?' I felt startled at such a question on Christmas morning, but answered, 'Oh, no, dear, not yet.' She was greatly disappointed, and said, 'I thought He would have sent for her to keep Christmas with Him.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Britten and Bird {{go to see}} Sam at his home; {{he claims}} {{that he was trying}} to find out about his father, who had cancer. Britten asks how tall he was; outside, Bird asks for an {{explanation}} and Britten tries to spin a story about a small window at the clinic that someone could have crawled through to poison MacKenzie. His partner warns Britten that coming up with theories and looking for evidence to fit is not standard procedure. That night, Rex and Cole work on their motorbike. Later, in the [...] "red reality", Hannah tells Britten that she opened the package and <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> did. She tells her husband about the motorcycle, and how the boys would claim they were going to the beach when they went off to work on it. At the station, Vega tells Britten that they have a new case; however, he insists on sticking with the MacKenzie shooting and checks photos of short criminals. The homeless man comes in and offers more information in return for lunch. The partners start arguing, and Captain Tricia Harper (Laura Innes) calls Britten into her office. Soon after, Britten asks Vega if he wants to lead a new case.|$|E

6000|$|... "That's a {{different}} thing, but just supposing you were exactly in my shoes at this moment, {{do you mean}} to tell me that you'd <b>be</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> should get well?--that you'd <b>be</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> should <b>be</b> able to deprive you of your property, disgrace your family, drive you from your own home, and make your life miserable for ever after?" ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> safe. It pains me to write, I will rest a while.|$|R
60|$|Laura <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> had {{undertaken}} {{the journey}} {{when she saw}} the sudden intentness of his face.|$|E
60|$|I read {{selections}} from this letter aloud to Ethelbertha. She said she <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> {{had decided to}} come down with me.|$|E
60|$|I {{remembered the}} time when Minnie was a young and pretty girl; and I <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> remembered it too, so feelingly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Remember {{that she}} has no time to be pretty, and <b>be</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> so neat and willing. Shall we read, dear? I'm ready now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> has come. There is a {{woman with}} a head and a heart too, Hastings. Though the good God gave her no beauty!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Poor thing! I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> recovering,' said Lady Martindale. 'It {{was very}} kind in {{you to stay}} with Arthur. I only hope {{you have not been}} hurting yourself.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{ventured to}} say that I <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> said they, and hoped {{it was a sign}} that she was finding out Clarence.|$|E
6000|$|... "You've great courage, you've rare qualities," [...] Sherringham risked. She {{had begun}} to touch him, to seem different: he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> had not gone.|$|E
60|$|He {{noted the}} common accent. It pleased him. He knew what class she came of. Probably {{she was a}} warehouse-lass. He <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> was a common girl.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, she {{is looking}} very handsome," [...] said Grace. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> has consented to have her hair in that now way, it is very {{becoming}} to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{should have}} told me; I should like to send her my love. I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> has not quite {{forgotten}} us, though she mistook {{the way to her}} own happiness.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, my dear. I almost wish it was. I {{shall never}} {{get on with}} her; but I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> should come and be near you all; and Miles likes her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, then, {{you know}} you made me, and I {{think it is a}} shame. She said she <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> wasn't one of them, for you were such a {{peculiar}} child.' ...|$|E
60|$|She <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> {{had been}} able to cry. She had always hated herself for her lack of tears; it was so unwomanly. Even as a child she had rarely cried.|$|E
6000|$|... "What is it?" [...] I cried, and for {{a moment}} I believe I <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> did not answer. She seemed to have told me already as much as I could bear.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Leave her alone, {{leave her}} alone,' said Festus, his gaze blackening. 'Now I {{think of it}} I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> can't come with me, for I am engaged;' and he stalked away.|$|R
60|$|If Elizabeth <b>were</b> <b>glad,</b> <b>she</b> {{showed no}} sign of it. She seemed to have become rooted to the spot, {{suddenly}} dumb. Philip, by her side, heard the quick indrawing of her breath.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{liked her}} letter," [...] said Babie, [...] "and I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> such a {{daughter}} to you, mother. Allen {{says he is}} thankful {{she is not a}} Japanese with black teeth." ...|$|R
60|$|Thanking her, {{the young}} oarsman got out without delay. He <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> had {{directed}} him, for {{now he was}} certain he would at least strike a place that would fit his pocket-book.|$|E
60|$|Somerset {{thought it}} a forcible {{illustration}} of her natural reticence {{that she should have}} abandoned the design without telling him the reason; but he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> had not done it from mere caprice.|$|E
60|$|He stood up--she unbolted {{the back}} door, and looked out. A cold, raw night, not yet dawn, {{with a piece}} of a moon in the vague sky. She <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> need not go out.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> {{away for}} a few minutes. She has been over wrought, and I am always afraid for her. She is so sensitive. And after all she is only a baby!' ...|$|R
6000|$|Her sensuous exaltation, her tremulous longing after harmony, {{had passed}} away; in her heart, strangely mingled, were these two thoughts: 'If only {{she were a}} lady!' and, 'I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not a lady!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is Aunt Emmeline gone?" [...] asked Ayala, {{when she}} came down. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> has gone, because I never know how to look when she calls me dear. I know she hates me." ...|$|R
60|$|Ethel <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> had {{repeated}} this, {{for there}} was a deepening colour and smiling glow of pleasure on her brother's face, such as she had seldom seen on his delicate, but somewhat impassive features.|$|E
6000|$|Ah, now I saw her idea, and <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> {{had had the}} cleverness {{to invent}} it {{and the ability to}} keep her head cool and think of it in that tight place. The officer replied: ...|$|E
60|$|Pony promised {{his mother}} never to touch other people's fruit, but he <b>was</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> {{did not ask}} him to throw it back over the fence if it fell outside, for he knew the fellows would laugh.|$|E
50|$|Finally, Fouldes {{talks to}} Lady Frederick. He <b>is</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> burnt the letters, which, he says, {{she did in}} spite of being {{provoked}} by his sister Lady Mereston; he says they should get married, and she consents.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{think it}} is much nicer to be buried under grass and flowers when our souls have flown away to heaven," [...] said Nelly, {{beginning}} to <b>be</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not a [...] "truly" [...] mermaid.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was afraid, just {{a little}} afraid," [...] he said slowly, [...] "of the other woman. I <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>she</b> didn't count enough. Women are the very devil {{sometimes}} when they come {{between us and the}} right thing!" ...|$|R
