25|$|After the {{emergence}} of Volap√ºk, {{a wide variety of}} other auxiliary languages were devised and proposed in the 1880s‚Äì1900s, but none except Esperanto gathered a significant speaker community. Esperanto was developed from about 1873‚Äì1887 (a first version was ready in 1878), and finally published in 1887, by L. L. Zamenhof, as a primarily schematic language; the word stems are borrowed from Romance, West Germanic and Slavic languages. The key to the relative success of Esperanto was probably the highly productive and elastic system of derivational word formation which allowed speakers to derive hundreds of other words by learning one <b>word</b> <b>root.</b> Moreover Esperanto is quicker to learn than other languages, usually in a third up to a fifth of the time. From early on, Esperantists created their own culture which helped to form the Esperanto language community.|$|E
25|$|This stage {{began its}} {{evolution}} as a dialect of Proto-Indo-European {{that had lost}} its laryngeals and had five long and six short vowels {{as well as one}} or two overlong vowels. The consonant system was still that of PIE minus palatovelars and laryngeals, but the loss of syllabic resonants already made the language markedly different from PIE proper. Mutual intelligibility might have still existed with other descendants of PIE, {{but it would have been}} strained, and the period marked the definitive break of Germanic from the other Indo-European languages and the beginning of Germanic proper, containing most of the sound changes that are now held to define this branch distinctively. This stage contained various consonant and vowel shifts, the loss of the contrastive accent inherited from PIE for a uniform accent on the first syllable of the <b>word</b> <b>root,</b> and the beginnings of the reduction of the resulting unstressed syllables.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 600 native <b>word</b> <b>roots</b> {{are shared}} by the Finnic and Samic languages, of which {{approximately}} 100 lack cognates in the other Uralic languages. The high number of Finnic loanwords in Samic makes exact analysis however difficult, and old loanwords from Samic to Finnic may also be involved, {{especially in light of}} approximately a third of these words being absent also from the more southern Finnic languages (Estonian, Livonian and Votic). These numbers can be contrasted with ca. 40 <b>word</b> <b>roots</b> exclusive to Finnic and Mordvinic, 12 <b>word</b> <b>roots</b> exclusive to Samic and Mordvinic, and 22 <b>word</b> <b>roots</b> exclusive to all three.|$|R

2500|$|During {{the first}} century CE, Pomponius Mela refers to the [...] "Turcae" [...] in the forests north of the Sea of Azov, and Pliny the Elder lists the [...] "Tyrcae" [...] among {{the people of the}} same area.

Turkologist Andr√°s R√≥na-Tas posits that the term Turk could be rooted in the East Iranian Saka language or in Turkic. However, it is generally accepted that the term [...] "T√ºrk" [...] is ultimately derived from the Old-Turkic migration-term ê±Öê∞áê∞ºê∞∞ T√ºr√ºk/T√∂r√ºk, which means [...] "created", [...] "born", or [...] "strong", from the Old Turkic <b>word</b> <b>root</b> *t√ºri-/t√∂ri- ("tribal root, (mythic) ancestry; take shape, to be born, be created, arise, spring up") and conjugated with Old Turkic suffix ê∞∞ (-ik), perhaps from Proto-Turkic *t√ºri-k ("lineage, ancestry"), from the Proto-Turkic <b>word</b> <b>root</b> *t√∂≈ï ("foundation, root; origin, ancestors"), possibly from a Proto-Altaic source *t`≈èÃÄ≈ïe ("law, regulation").

2500|$|The name spud {{for a small}} potato {{comes from}} the digging of soil (or a hole) prior to the {{planting}} of potatoes. The word has an unknown origin and was originally (c. 1440) used as a term for a short knife or dagger, probably related to the Latin [...] "spad-" [...] a <b>word</b> <b>root</b> meaning [...] "sword"; cf. Spanish [...] "espada", English [...] "spade" [...] and [...] "spadroon". It subsequently transferred over {{to a variety of}} digging tools. Around 1845, the name transferred to the tuber itself. The origin of the word [...] "spud" [...] has erroneously been attributed to a 19th-century activist group dedicated to keeping the potato out of Britain, calling itself The Society for the Prevention of an Unwholesome Diet (S.P.U.D.). It was Mario Pei's 1949 The Story of Language that can be blamed for the word's false origin. Pei writes, [...] "the potato, for its part, was in disrepute some centuries ago. Some Englishmen who did not fancy potatoes formed a Society for the Prevention of Unwholesome Diet. The initials of the main words in this title gave rise to spud." [...] Like most other pre-20th century acronymic origins, this is false.|$|E
2500|$|The term palsy {{in modern}} {{language}} {{refers to a}} disorder of movement, but the <b>word</b> <b>root</b> [...] "palsy" [...] technically means [...] "paralysis", {{even though it is}} not used as such within the meaning of cerebral palsy. The use of [...] "palsy" [...] in the term cerebral palsy makes it important to note that paralytic disorders are in fact not cerebral palsy‚Äì meaning that the condition of tetraplegia, which comes from spinal cord injury or traumatic brain injury, {{should not be confused with}} spastic quadriplegia, which does not, nor should tardive dyskinesia be confused with dyskinetic cerebral palsy or the condition of (paralytic) [...] "diplegia" [...] with spastic diplegia. In fact, as of the early 21st century some clinicians have become so distressed at common incorrect use of these terms that they have resorted to new naming schemes rather than trying to reclaim the classic ones; one such example of this evolution is the increasing use of the term bilateral spasticity to refer to spastic diplegia. Such clinicians even argue quite often that the [...] "new" [...] term is technically more clinically accurate than the established term.|$|E
50|$|In {{the process}} of {{creating}} medical terminology, certain rules of language apply. These rules are part of language mechanics called linguistics. So, when a term is developed, some logical process is applied. The <b>word</b> <b>root</b> is developed to include a vowel sound following the term to add a smoothing action {{to the sound of the}} word when applying a suffix. The result is the formation of a new term with a vowel attached (<b>word</b> <b>root</b> + vowel) called a combining form. In English, the most common vowel used in the formation of the combining form is the letter -o-, added to the <b>word</b> <b>root.</b>|$|E
