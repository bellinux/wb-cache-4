5|$|Arghezi's texts for Seara {{were largely}} unknown to later generations.

According to philogist Gheorghe Pienescu, who collected and reedited the texts for printing in the 1960s, the copies were taken from him under false pretense by Mitzura Arghezi, and never returned. As an additional contribution to Romanian literature, Searas popularization of the expression craii de Curtea-Veche may have inspired Mateiu Caragiale in <b>writing</b> <b>his</b> celebrated 1929 novel.|$|E
