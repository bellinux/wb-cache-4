5|$|National {{consistency}} of governance. In 1978 the Northern Territory achieved self-government.

5|$|The park's {{name comes}} from the Manor of Hyde, which was the {{northeast}} sub-division of the manor of Eia (the other two sub-divisions were Ebury and Neyte) and appears as such in the Domesday Book. The name {{is believed to be}} of Saxon origin, and means a unit of land, the hide, that <b>was</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> the support of a single family and dependents. Through the Middle Ages, it was property of Westminster Abbey, and the woods in the manor were used both for firewood and shelter for game.|$|E
5|$|The holonovel was {{intended}} as a vehicle to further explore Janeway's imagination and her social relationships, but critics disagreed on whether the storyline <b>was</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> the character. The plotlines introduced in Janeway Lambda one were never fully resolved due to lack of interest from fans of the Voyager series and an attempt to target a male audience; Taylor had written a conclusion for the holonovel, but it was never developed into an episode. Janeway Lambda one was received negatively by television critics who believed it was poorly developed and too isolated from the main storylines of the Voyager series. The show's frequent use and expansion of the holodeck technology was also panned by reviewers.|$|E
5|$|The warning <b>was</b> <b>appropriate,</b> <b>for</b> in the Congressional elections, Republicans {{won their}} biggest {{landslide}} in decades, taking {{full control of}} the House, while the Populists lost most of their support. Cleveland's factional enemies gained control of the Democratic Party in state after state, including full control in Illinois and Michigan, and made major gains in Ohio, Indiana, Iowa and other states. Wisconsin and Massachusetts {{were two of the}} few states that remained under the control of Cleveland's allies. The Democratic opposition were close to controlling two-thirds of the vote at the 1896 national convention, which they needed to nominate their own candidate. They failed for lack of unity and a national leader, as Illinois governor John Peter Altgeld had been born in Germany and was ineligible to be nominated for President.|$|E

5|$|The Third Fleet sailed from Ulithi on 30 December 1944. On 3 and 4 January its {{aircraft}} carriers struck Japanese airfields on Formosa, Okinawa and nearby islands {{in an attempt}} to prevent them from being used to attack the Allied forces at Lingayen Gulf. In addition, its strike aircraft attacked Japanese shipping at Formosa, sinking at least three merchant vessels and damaging four frigates. Acting on a request from General Douglas MacArthur, the commander of the South West Pacific Area, the fleet struck airfields on Luzon on 6 and 7 January. At around this time Vice-Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, the commander of the Seventh Fleet which was responsible for the Lingayen Gulf landings, asked Halsey to operate west of Luzon to provide air cover during the initial period of the invasion. Halsey did not believe that it <b>was</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> his force to operate in such a passive role, and instead ordered further strikes on the Japanese airfields in southern Formosa which posed the greatest threat to Kinkaid's command. These took place on 9 January. During the morning of 9 January, Nimitz released the Third Fleet from directly covering the Lingayen Gulf area, and authorized it to enter the South China Sea. Once all the strike aircraft had landed that afternoon Halsey issued orders to execute the planned attack into the South China Sea. During the fleet's operations from 3 to 9 January it destroyed more than 150 Japanese aircraft, but lost 86 of its own, including 46 in accidents.|$|E

25|$|The University Charter of 1900 also {{included}} provision for a commerce faculty, as <b>was</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> a university itself founded by industrialists and based {{in a city}} with enormous business wealth, in effect creating the first Business School in England.

25|$|Members of {{religious}} orders were {{major sources of}} medical knowledge and cures. There {{appears to have been}} some controversy regarding the appropriateness of medical practice for members {{of religious}} orders. The Decree of the Second Lateran Council of 1139 advised the religious to avoid medicine because it was a well-paying job with higher social status than <b>was</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> the clergy. However, this official policy was not often enforced in practice and many religious continued to practice medicine.|$|E
25|$|The drink {{originated}} in 1973 when Tilburgian entrepreneur Jan Wassing started {{experimenting with a}} drink with lower alcoholic percentage that <b>was</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> his stomach. The result was successful. The drink is distilled now at Loven industrial area in Tilburg by the Eindhoven company Schrobbeler Ltd, without the Ã¨ on the last vowel.

25|$|Partway {{through the}} second season, the show was moved back to its {{original}} earlier time. CBS executives wanted to free up the prized post-M*A*S*H slot for House Calls (with former M*A*S*H star Wayne Rogers). They also felt that {{the rock and roll}} music and the sex appeal of Loni Anderson were better-suited to the earlier slot, which at that time was thought of as mostly aimed at young people. The mid-season timeslot change didn't affect the show's success; WKRP finished at #22 in the ratings for its second year. For the next two seasons, however, the writers and producers often had to fight CBS over what kind of content <b>was</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> a show in the so-called family hour.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the centuries}} {{the village of}} Sacrow and its manor changed hands many times. In October 1840, Friedrich Wilhelm IV, King of Prussia, bought the estate for 60,000 thalers and added it to his lands in Potsdam a month later. Long before the purchase, the king had sketched out a church {{building}} for Sacrow. The new building <b>was</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> a cove, a port where fishermen on the Havel could seek shelter with their boats during storms. For the king, the location quite symbolic: he saw the nave as a bulwark against the storms of life. The church seal alludes to this with its Latin inscription: S. Ecclesiae sanctissimi Salvatoris in portu sacro (Church of the Most Holy Redeemer in the Sacred Port).|$|E
25|$|Section 74 of the Constitution, as {{enacted by}} the Imperial Parliament, {{prohibited}} appeals on constitutional matters involving disputes about the limits inter se of Commonwealth or state powers, except where the High Court certified it <b>was</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> the appeal {{to be determined by}} the Privy Council. It did so only once: in the 1912 case of Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd v Attorney-General (Cth) when the Court was equally divided. After that case, in which the Privy Council refused to answer the constitutional questions put to it, the High Court never certified another inter se appeal. Indeed, in the case of Kirmani v Captain Cook Cruises Pty Ltd (1985), the court said that it would never again grant a certificate of appeal.|$|E

25|$|When the February 28 Incident {{erupted in}} 1947, the U.S. Consulate-General in Taipei {{prepared}} {{a report in}} early March, calling for an immediate intervention {{in the name of}} the U.S. or the United Nations. Based on the argument that the Japanese surrender did not formally transfer sovereignty, Taiwan was still legally part of Japan and occupied by the United States (with administrative authority for the occupation delegated to the Chinese Nationalists), and a direct intervention <b>was</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> a territory with such status. This proposed intervention, however, was rejected by the U.S. State Department. In a news report on the aftermath of the February 28 Incident, some Taiwanese residents were reported to be talking of appealing to the United Nations to put the island under an international mandate, since China's possession of Taiwan had not been formalized by any international treaties by that time and the island was therefore still under belligerent occupation.|$|E
25|$|After {{the body}} was carried to the cemetery, a {{sacrifice}} was performed {{in the presence of}} the corpse. Until the time of Cicero, it was customary to offer a sow to Ceres, a sow also being a characteristic offering to chthonic deities. The sacrificial victim was then allotted for consumption among the participants. The portion for the deceased was put on a spit and cremated with the body. Ceres' portion was burned on an altar. The family ate the portion that was due the living. A family of lesser means offered a libation of wine, incense, produce or grain; the allocation of these offerings is not recorded. After this apportioning, the deceased had transitioned and could no longer share in the meals of the living and the domestic gods; he now partook of what <b>was</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> the spirits of the dead, the Manes.|$|E
25|$|Apple did {{not develop}} the iPod {{software}} entirely in-house, instead using PortalPlayer's reference platform {{based on two}} ARM cores. The platform had rudimentary software running on a commercial microkernel embedded operating system. PortalPlayer had previously been working on an IBM-branded MP3 player with Bluetooth headphones. Apple contracted another company, Pixo, to help design and implement the user interface under the direct supervision of Steve Jobs. As development progressed, Apple continued to refine the software's look and feel. Starting with the iPod Mini, the Chicago font was replaced with Espy Sans. Later iPods switched fonts again to Podium Sansâa font similar to Apple's corporate font, Myriad. Color display iPods then adopted some Mac OS X themes like Aqua progress bars, and brushed metal meant to evoke a combination lock. In 2007, Apple modified the iPod interface again {{with the introduction of}} the sixth-generation iPod Classic and third-generation iPod Nano by changing the font to Helvetica and, in most cases, splitting the screen in half by displaying the menus on the left and album artwork, photos, or videos on the right (whichever <b>was</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>for</b> the selected item).|$|E
