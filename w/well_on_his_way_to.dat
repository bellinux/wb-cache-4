Indeed, the weaker the French Republic seemed, the more seriously the Austrians, the Neapolitans, the Russians and the English actually discussed this possibility.|$|E

The NFL's rushing record for a rookie is held by Eric Dickerson at 1,808 yards. Just 11 weeks into his rookie season with the Vikings, Peterson was <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> Dickerson's record and considered one of the elite running backs in the NFL.|$|E

He served a two-year ban from July 2007 to July 2009 for lying about his whereabouts.

Gimblett was <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> his famous century when Andrews joined him batting at number 10. Andrews was a {{sufficiently}} competent batsmen by this stage to keep Gimblett company, knowing that only Horace Hazell was left to bat. On Gimblett's departure Andrews {{took advantage of the}} dispirited Essex attack to score a rapid 71 and his first half-century. He took 108 wickets in 1935, the most by a Somerset bowler, although his 95 Championship wickets was just pipped by Arthur Wellard's 97.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{is widely}} {{believed}} that his campaigns were only a token measure and that Roman rule over the Balkans collapsed immediately after his overthrow in 602, Maurice was in fact <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> forestalling the Slavic landfall on the Balkans, nearly preserving the order of Late Antiquity there. His success was only undone over ten years after his overthrow. Retrospectively, these campaigns were the last in the series of classical Roman campaigns against the Barbarians on the Rhine and Danube, effectively delaying Slavic landfall on the Balkans by two decades. With respect to the Slavs, these campaigns had the typical trait of Roman campaigns against unorganized tribes and of what we now call asymmetric warfare.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} 1983, Kapil {{already had}} about 250 Test wickets in just five years and looked <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> {{becoming}} one of the most prolific wicket-takers ever. However, his bowling declined following knee surgery in 1984, as he lost some of his jump at the crease. Despite this setback, he never missed playing a single test or one-day game on fitness grounds (save for his disciplinary ouster in the 3rd test at Calcutta during the 1984/85 series against England). Though he lost some of his bite, he remained an effective bowler for another ten years and became the second bowler ever to take 400 wickets in Test cricket in 1991–92 when he took Mark Taylor's wicket in a series versus Australia in Australia. In that Australian tour he took 25 wickets.|$|E

At {{one point in the}} match, Kasparov opened a three-point lead and looked <b>well</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> a decisive match victory. But Karpov fought back by winning three consecutive games to level the score late in the match. At this point, Kasparov dismissed one of his seconds, grandmaster Evgeny Vladimirov, accusing him of selling his opening preparation to the Karpov team (as described in Kasparov's autobiography Unlimited Challenge, chapter Stab in the Back). Kasparov scored one more win and kept his title by a final score of 12½–11½.|$|E
25|$|Héctor {{attended}} the local Juan Morel Campos Public School of Music {{where the first}} instrument he learned to play was the saxophone. His classmates included José Febles and multi-instrumentalist Papo Lucca. One of his teachers was very strict and demanded that he practice good diction and manners, and have a strong stage presence. He felt Héctor would become a superstar as a bolero singer. From the start Héctor was a star with exceptional charisma, talent, and charm. One of a kind, his unique voice, refined and with impeccable diction, demanded attention. <b>Well</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> becoming a popular-music vocalist, he began frequenting clubs such as Segovia, where he sang accompanied by his childhood friends, Roberto García and José Febles. At age 17, Lavoe abandoned school and sang with a ten-piece band. He moved permanently to New York on May 3, 1963, against his father's wishes, as an older brother had moved there and later died of a drug overdose. It would take many years before Héctor was able to reconcile with his father.|$|E

Hay left Washington for the last time on June 23, 1905, arriving in New Hampshire the following day. He died there on July 1 of his heart ailment and complications.
