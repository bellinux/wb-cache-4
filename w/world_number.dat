5|$|At the ATP finals, Murray beat Djokovic 6–3 6–4, {{claiming}} {{the title and}} the No.1 spot {{at the end of}} the year, and ending 2016 on a 24-match winning streak, the longest of his career. He became the second player after Andre Agassi to win Grand Slam, World Tour Finals, Olympic and Masters titles, and the first to do so in the same calendar year. 2016 marked the first year since 2003 that neither Federer, Nadal or Djokovic finished the year as <b>world</b> <b>number</b> 1. Despite his struggles with form throughout the second half of the year, Djokovic still ended 2016 as <b>world</b> <b>number</b> 2. Having suffered from injury plagued seasons, Nadal and Federer ended the year at number 9 and number 16 respectively.
