5000|$|Stan Lee, in a 1988 interview, {{recalled}} that Goodman: ...had {{gone with the}} American News Company. I remember saying to him, 'Gee, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that?</b> I thought {{that we had a}} good distribution company.' His answer was like, 'Oh, Stan, you wouldn't understand. It has to do with finance.' I didn't really give a damn, and I went back to doing the comics. Later, we were left without a distributor and we couldn't go back to distributing our own books because the fact that Martin quit doing it and went with American News had gotten the wholesalers very angry ... {{and it would have been}} impossible for Martin to just say, 'Okay, we'll go back to where we were and distribute our books.' had been turning out 40, 50, 60 books a month, maybe more, and now the only company we could get to distribute our books was our closest rival, National DC Comics. Suddenly we went ... to either eight or 12 books a month, which was all Independent News Distributors would accept from us.|$|E
5000|$|The {{implications}} of this philosophy of intentional action were extended by Hacking in Rewriting the Soul. His argument is as follows: When we talk about people, we talk about ourselves as intentional beings. Our description of our acts are almost always descriptions of how an act was intended. We offer an explanation of why we act thus and so. The array of descriptions available to an individual depend on the descriptions available to the society {{in which the individual}} resides. Hence, the media, the expertise of psychologists, physicians and scientists and the folk understandings of cultural communities all provide descriptions that can be assumed by an individual in the moment that he or she acts. For example, a child pushes another child in the playground. If asked <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> he might answer [...] "to show who's boss," [...] "because I have ADHD" [...] or [...] "because I was provoked." [...] Hacking is not concerned with which description is true, but rather, how the descriptions under which people act depend on the descriptions available to them. “Action is action under a description”.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT—Some {{actions are}} freer than others, and the {{difference}} is palpably {{important in terms of}} inner process, subjective perception, and social consequences. Psychology can study the difference between freer and less free actions without making dubious metaphysical commitments. Human evolution seems to have created a relatively new, more complex form of action control that corresponds to popular notions of free will. It is marked by self-control and rational choice, both of which are highly adaptive, especially for functioning within culture. The processes that create these forms of freewillmaybe biologically costly and therefore are only used occasionally, so that people are likely to remain only incompletely self-disciplined, virtuous, and rational.
