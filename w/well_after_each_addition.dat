40|$|Ethanol and {{methanol}} are {{two important}} alcohols used for different purposes. Consequently, also the analytical {{methods used to}} determine them are of considerable interest. Our team is therefore developing three different sensor-based methods for ethanol and methanol determination. Two of these consist of different enzyme electrodes and have been developed by immobilizing either alcohol oxidase or catalase in a kappa-Carrageenan gel layer overlapping an amperometric gaseous diffusion Clark type oxygen electrode. The variation of the oxygen concentration in the aqueous solution due to the enzymatic reactions was measured at a constant applied potential of – 650 mV. The responses of these biosensors toward standard solutions of methanol or ethanol were recorded, compared and discussed. In {{the case of the}} catalase electrode, the measurement was performed by adding hydrogen peroxide to a buffer solution which was diffused through the dialysis membrane towards the enzymatic layer where the reaction catalysed by the catalase enzyme took place: H 2 O 2 1 / 2 O 2 + H 2 O. Since this reaction led to the production of oxygen, the concentration of the latter in the measurement solution increased. This increase triggered an increase in the cathodic current measured which increased from the original value to a new value corresponding to a new stationary state. At this stage further additions were made (equal to 20 μL) of a standard solution of 0. 008 mol L- 1 of ethanol or methanol; <b>after</b> <b>each</b> <b>addition</b> a reaction of the following type occurred which was catalyzed by catalase: CH 3 CH 2 OH + H 2 O 2 CH 3 CHO + 2 H 2 O. The second reaction removed part of the H 2 O 2 substrate from the first reaction, which was slowed down; this slowdown was accompanied by a decrease in the level of oxygen produced in the solution during the first reaction; this decrease was evidenced by the decrease in the measured cathodic current which attained a new stationary state <b>after</b> <b>each</b> <b>addition</b> of alcohol solution. The current variation was read off <b>after</b> <b>each</b> alcohol <b>addition</b> [1]. With the biosensor operating with alcohol oxidase the operating procedure was much simpler as it consisted of directly making successive additions of the standard ethanol or methanol solution to a buffer solution in which the measurement was being performed. <b>After</b> <b>each</b> <b>addition</b> a reaction catalyzed by the alcohol oxidase enzyme of the following type took place: CH 3 CH 2 OH + O 2 CH 3 CHO + H 2 O 2. The reaction led to the oxygen present in the solution being consumed with a consequent decrease in the cathodic current measured until a new stationary state was reached. Also in this case, <b>after</b> <b>each</b> <b>addition,</b> the current variation was read off. All the experiments were carried out in a reaction cell thermostated at 23 °C containing 15 mL of 0. 05 mol L- 1 phosphate buffer solution. The effect of pH on the response of the electrodes was investigated in detail and the best pH was found to be 7. 5 for the catalase electrode and 8. 0 for the alcohol oxidase electrode, respectively. The catalase biosensor displayed a much greater sensitivity to ethanol than to methanol, unlike the alcohol oxidase biosensor. It also displayed a stability and a life-time at least triple that of the alcohol oxidase biosensor as well as an LOD at least one decade lower. It also displayed a better repeatability and reproducibilty for ethanol and methanol solutions. The alcohol oxidase biosensor was instead found to be more sensitive to methanol than to ethanol but allowed the test to be carried out slightly faster than with the catalase device. In conclusion, our team is now investigating the feasibility of using a small catalytic ‘fuel cell’ originally constructed for the purpose of obtaining energy from methanol or ethanol but now adapted for analytical purposes [2, 3]. The intention is to see whether this kind of device can also be used for ethanol and methanol determination. To this end water-alcohol solutions containing increasing percentages of ethanol or methanol are added to the cell, then following the potential increase that occurs at two electrodes of the cell and lastly reading off the maximum potential obtained with <b>each</b> <b>addition.</b> Although this part of the research is only at the preliminary stage it has already been possible to obtain calibration curves for both methanol and ethanol.

Potentiometric titration curves of these phenolic acids with tetrabutylammonium hydroxide in pyri-dine solvent look very much like the titration curves of weak diprotic acids obtained in an aqueous media with a strong base. In addition, equilibrium is attained very rapidly <b>after</b> <b>each</b> <b>addition</b> of the titrant. However, a second end point cannot be easily observed in the case of 2 -propanol. None of the compounds cited above gave meaningful conductimetric and potentiometric titration curves upon titration with triethylamine, which is a weaker base than tetrabutylammonium hydroxide...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an iterative method for designing FIR filters that implement arbitrary magnitude characteristics, {{defined by the}} user {{through a set of}} frequency-magnitude points (frequency samples). The proposed method is based on the non-uniform frequency sampling algorithm. For each iteration a new set of frequency samples is generated, by processing the set used in the previous run; this implies changing the samples location around the previous frequency values and adjusting their magnitude through interpolation. If necessary, additional samples can be introduced, as <b>well.</b> <b>After</b> <b>each</b> iteration the magnitude characteristic of the resulting filter is determined by using the non-uniform DFT and compared with the required one; if the errors are larger than the acceptable levels (set by the user) a new iteration is run; the length of the resulting filter and the values of its coefficients are also taken into consideration when deciding a re-run. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method a tool for designing FIR filters that match human audiograms was implemented in LabVIEW. It was shown that the resulting filters have smaller coefficients than the standard one, and can also have lower order, while the errors remain relatively small...|$|R
30|$|Comparison {{of overall}} {{cofermentation}} outcome between batch and fed-batch prefermentation of severe hydrolyzate liquor {{followed by two}} additions of enzymatic hydrolyzate (Fig.  3) exemplify the different consequences in a high inhibitor concentration context. Batch prefermentation followed by fed-batch cofermentation of enzymatic hydrolyzate elicited a xylose utilization of 71  % and an overall ethanol yield of 0.381  g·g− 1. In contrast, the corresponding strategy with fed-batch prefermentation resulted in low glucose conversion and, seemingly, no xylose consumption after fed-batch prefermentation of severe hydrolyzate liquor (Fig.  3 b). Fed-batch prefermentation supplied lower initial concentrations of inhibitors than batch prefermentation, but the continuous feed of hydrolyzate liquor seemingly exhausted the yeast. The continuous feed of inhibitors during fed-batch prefermentation exceeded the detoxification rate, {{which resulted in the}} accumulation of non-metabolized furaldehydes (data not shown). The furaldehydes were not fully converted during the sequent fed-batch cofermentation of enzymatic hydrolyzate. In contrast, the yeast was resilient to the higher initial inhibitor concentrations in batch prefermentation. The yeast was capable of promptly detoxifying the hydrolyzate liquor during batch prefermentation and <b>after</b> <b>each</b> <b>addition</b> of enzymatic hydrolyzate (data not shown). The decreased viability and fermentative capacity of the yeast was likely due to ceased growth and inhibitory effects [3]. The yeast cells were assumed to be particularly sensitive to exposure to inhibitors during the prefermentation of xylose-rich hydrolyzate liquor, because the conversion of xylose does not support growth efficiently [43].|$|R
40|$|An energy {{optimised}} Tree Branch Methodology {{was developed}} to overcome the multiple minima problem in molecular mechanics calculations of acyclic molecules. Target molecules were assembled one heavy atom at a time from small precursors, and the energy minimized <b>after</b> <b>each</b> <b>addition.</b> The number of structures to be minimised was significantly reduced by following the lowest energy path in the Tree Branch Method. Comparison of the calculated configurations to minimum energy structures obtained from complete conformational search is made. The compression of fatty acid monolayers in Langmuir-Blodgett trough experiments at the air/water interface was modelled using a two dimensional array. The minimum energy configuration of the acids was obtained using the Tree Branch Methodology, and the water coordination number determined by comparison of calculated and experimentally measured dipole moments. The variation in measured dipole moments as the hydrated head group was compressed were explained. Minimum energy configurations of known surfactant molecules used {{in the preparation of}} water-in-oil emulsion explosives were obtained through the Tree Branch Methodology, and the optimised geometries used to calculate structural parameters assuming standard van der Waals radii around each atom. Comparison of the structural parameters to the stability of the emulsions in which the surfactants were used, allowed preliminary structural criteria to be established. Based on the structural criteria, a number of new families of surfactant head group were designed, and preliminary rules for matching head to tail group combinations proposed...|$|R
