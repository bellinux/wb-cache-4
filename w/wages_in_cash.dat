6000|$|This {{plan has}} been found necessary, {{in order to protect}} the Coolies both from {{themselves}} and from each other. They themselves prefer receiving the whole of their <b>wages</b> <b>in</b> <b>cash.</b> With that fondness for mere hard money which marks a half-educated Oriental, they will, as a rule, hoard their wages; and stint themselves of food, injuring their powers of work, and even endangering their own lives; as is proved by the broad fact that the death-rate among them has much decreased, especially during the first year of residence, since the plan of giving them rations has been at work. The newcomers need, too, protection from their own countrymen. Old Coolies who have served their time and saved money find it convenient to turn rice- sellers or money-lenders. They have powerful connections on many estates; they first advance money or luxuries to a newcomer, and when he is once entrapped, they sell him the necessaries of life at famine prices. Thus the practical effect of rations has been to lessen the number of those little roadside shops, which were a curse to Trinidad, and are still a curse to the English workman. [...] Moreover--for all men are not perfect, even in Trinidad--the Coolie required protection, in certain cases, against a covetous and short- sighted employer, who might fancy it to be his interest to let the man idle during his first year, while weak, and so save up an arrear of 'lost days' to be added at the end of the five years, when he was a strong skilled labourer. An employer will have, of course, far less temptation to do this, while, as now, he is bound to feed the Coolie for the first two years. Meanwhile, be it remembered, the very fact that such a policy was tempting, goes to prove that the average Coolie grew, during his five years' apprenticeship, a stronger, and not a weaker, man.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{an admirable}} piece of lucid exposition. Slowly {{the picture of}} a better, happier, more disciplined England grew upon the minds of the meeting. First she showed the new sort of {{employer}} her movement would evoke, an employer paternal, philanthropic, vaguely responsible for the social order of all his dependants. (Lady Petchworth was seen to nod her head slowly at this.) Only in the last resort, and when he was satisfied that his worker and his worker's family were properly housed, hygienically clothed and fed, attending suitable courses of instruction and free from any vicious inclinations, would he pay <b>wages</b> <b>in</b> <b>cash.</b> In the discharge of the duties of payment he would have the assistance of expert advice, and the stimulus of voluntary inspectors of his own class. He would be the natural clan-master, the captain and leader, adviser and caretaker of his banded employees. Responsibility would stimulate him, and if responsibility did not stimulate him, inspectors (both men and women inspectors) would. The worker, on the other hand, would be enormously more healthy and efficient under the new r√©gime. His home, designed by qualified and officially recognized architects, would be prettier as well as more convenient and elevating to his taste, his children admirably trained and dressed in the new and more beautiful clothing with which Lady Petchworth (applause) had done so much to make them familiar, his vital statistics compared with current results would be astonishingly good, his mind free from any anxiety but the proper anxiety of a man in his position, to get his work done properly and earn recognition from those competent and duly authorized to judge it. Of all this she spoke with the inspiring note of absolute conviction. All this would follow Payment in Kind and Continuous Occupation as days follow sunrise. And there would always,--and here Aunt Plessington's voice seemed to brighten--be something for the worker to get on with, something for him to do; lectures, classes, reading-rooms, improving entertainments. His time would be filled. The proper authorities would see that it was filled--and filled in the right way. Never for a moment need he be bored. He would never have an excuse for being bored. That was the second great idea, the complementary idea to the first. [...] "And here it is," [...] she said, turning a large encouraging smile on Lady Petchworth, [...] "that the work of a National Theatre, instructive, stimulating, well regulated, and morally sustaining, would come in." [...] He wouldn't, of course, be compelled to go, but there would be his seat, part of his payment in kind, and the public-house would be shut, most other temptations would be removed....|$|E

50|$|A public {{employment}} programme (PEP)' or 'public works programme (PWP)' is {{the provision of}} employment by the creation of predominantly public goods at a prescribed wage for those unable to find alternative employment. This functions {{as a form of}} social safety net. PWPs are activities which entail the payment of a <b>wage</b> (<b>in</b> <b>cash</b> or <b>in</b> kind) by the state, or by an Agent (or cash-for work/CFW). One particular form of public works, that of offering a short-term period of employment, has come to dominate practice, particularly in regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa. Applied in the short term, this is appropriate as a response to transient shocks and acute labour market crises.|$|R
40|$|Workers in many {{countries}} receive part of their <b>wages</b> <b>in</b> kind. The International Labor Organization criticizes this practice by citing the "exploitative" truck system in industrializing Britain, which paid <b>wage</b> advances <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> and company store goods. This article finds that truck did not reduce British wages {{by as much as}} is believed, and that employers' ability to earn rents from hiring was limited. Company store premiums are interpreted as the cost of employer credit, and workers benefited from truck because most of the time independent credit cost at least as much. Firms earned rents from riskless loans to employees and avoided holdup by independent outlets at minimal transaction costs. The British truck system was mutually beneficial, and the evidence does not support the call to abolish similar practices today. Copyright 2006, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

50|$|In Wisconsin, for example, forest-products and lumber {{companies}} were specifically exempted {{from the state}} law requiring employers to pay workers' <b>wages</b> <b>in</b> <b>cash.</b> Lumber and timber companies frequently paid their workers in scrip which was redeemable at the company store. Company-run stores served as a convenience for workers and their families, but also allowed the companies to recapture some of their labor expenses.

Employees who wanted to change their scrip to cash generally had to do so at a discount.|$|E

40|$|The {{period from}} the 1950 s {{to the late}} 1970 s saw an almost uniform decline of cash-to-GDP ratios in {{industrial}} countries. A {{closer look at the}} German payment system suggests that the factor causing such a change has been the shift towards cashless <b>wage</b> payments. <b>In</b> this period, in Germany, the branch network of the banks expanded significantly {{and at the end of}} the period almost all economically active persons had a current account. This change was triggered by rising wages and incomes. Rising wages increased the burden of weekly <b>wage</b> payments <b>in</b> <b>cash,</b> and rising incomes made the average earner more interesting for banks. Moreover, regulation and de-regulation, triggering both, price and non-price competition, may also have played a role. Technological change has not been an independent driver. The introduction of cashless wage payments has not only affected the payment behavior but also the savings behaviour of households. These changes were evolutionary rather than revolutionary, however. So, even though the cash-to-GDP ratio declined in this period, absolute amounts of real cash per capita were still rising...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of weather risk on the off-farm labor supply of {{agricultural}} households in a developing country. Faced with the uninsurable risk of output and food price fluctuations, poor farmers in developing countries may diversify labor allocation across activities in order to smooth income in real terms. A key feature of this paper is that it distinguishes different types of off-farm labor markets: agriculture and non-agriculture on the one hand, and, <b>wages</b> paid <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> and <b>wages</b> paid <b>in</b> kind on the other. We develop a theoretical model of household optimization, which predicts that when farmers are faced with more production risk in their farm production, they find it more attractive to engage in non-agricultural work as a means of risk diversification, but the agricultural wage sector becomes more attractive when food security is an important issue for the farmers and agricultural <b>wages</b> are paid <b>in</b> kind. To test this prediction, we estimate a multivariate two-limit tobit model of labor allocation using household data from rural areas of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, India. The regression results show that the share of the off-farm labor supply increases with weather risk, the increase is much larger in the case of non-agricultural work than in the case of agricultural wage work, and the increase is much larger in the case of agricultural <b>wages</b> paid <b>in</b> kind than <b>in</b> the <b>cash</b> <b>wage</b> case. Simulation results based on the regression estimates show that the sectoral difference is substantial, implying that empirical and theoretical studies on farmers' labor supply response to risk should distinguish between the types of off-farm work involved. 21 ‰∏ñÁ¥ÄCOE„Éó„É≠„Ç∞„É©„É† = 21 st-Century COE Progra...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an agency}} model of contract {{choice in the}} hiring of labor and then uses the model to estimate the determinants of contract choice in rural Myanmar. As a salient feature relevant for the agricultural sector in a low income country such as Myanmar, the agency model incorporates considerations of food security and incentive effects. It is shown that when, possibly due to poverty, food considerations are important for employees, employers will prefer a labor contract with <b>wages</b> paid <b>in</b> kind (food) to one with <b>wages</b> paid <b>in</b> <b>cash.</b> At the same time, when output is responsive to workers' effort and labor monitoring is costly, employers will prefer a contract with piecerate wages to one with hourly wages. The case of sharecropping {{can be understood as}} a combination of the two: a labor contract with piecerate <b>wages</b> paid <b>in</b> kind. The predictions of the theoretical model are tested using a crosssection dataset collected in rural Myanmar through a sample household survey which was conducted in 2001 and covers diverse agroecological environments. The estimation results are consistent with the theoretical predictions: wages {{are more likely to be}} paid in kind when the share of staple food in workers' budget is higher and the farmland on which they produce food themselves is smaller; piecerate wages are more likely to be adopted when work effort is more difficult to monitor and the farming operation requires quick completion. 21 ‰∏ñÁ¥ÄCOE„Éó„É≠„Ç∞„É©„É† = 21 st-Century COE Progra...|$|R

Requiring landowners to make all their land productive, and if left idle, subject to government expropriation; the granting of a fixed amount of land to anyone who asks for it, provided they bring it into production and not sell it.

Not surprisingly, the PLM also called for restrictions on the Roman Catholic Church, which were incorporated in the constitution. These included treating religious institutions as businesses and required to pay taxes; nationalization of religious institutions real property; and the elimination of religious-run schools.|$|E
