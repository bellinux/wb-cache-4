25|$|The tensile {{strength}} of a material quantifies how much elongating stress the material <b>will</b> <b>endure</b> before failure. This {{is very important in}} applications that rely upon a polymer's physical strength or durability. For example, a rubber band with a higher {{tensile strength}} will hold a greater weight before snapping. In general, tensile strength increases with polymer chain length and crosslinking of polymer chains.|$|E

His membership of this network allowed him to establish an internationally recognised centre of excellence in UCC in operator algebras and non-commutative geometry, a legacy that <b>will</b> <b>endure.</b>|$|E

Alia has Wensicia imprisoned, but Ghanima accepts Farad'n's gesture as honest. With Stilgar's forces moving in, {{father and son}} return to {{the capital city of}} Arrakeen, where the Preacher makes a final speech denouncing Alia and his own religion, and is fatally stabbed by a rebel Fremen. Leto confronts Alia at Ghanima's wedding and defeats her. Alia then commits suicide rather than be controlled by the Baron. In the final scene, Ghanima tells Farad'n that while he will not be her husband, they may yet fall in love, and how she pities her brother for the pain and suffering he <b>will</b> <b>endure</b> in the long life he must expect.|$|E

500|$|Locke advises {{parents to}} {{carefully}} nurture their children's physical [...] "habits" [...] before pursuing their academic education. As many scholars have remarked, it is unsurprising that a trained physician, as Locke was, would begin Some Thoughts {{with a discussion}} of children's physical needs, yet this seemingly simple generic innovation has proven to be one of Locke's most enduring legacies—Western child-rearing manuals are still dominated by the topics of food and sleep. To convince parents that they must attend to the health of their children above all, Locke quotes from Juvenal's Satires—"a sound mind in a sound body." [...] Locke firmly believed that children should be exposed to harsh conditions while young to inure them to, for example, cold temperatures when they were older: [...] "Children [...] be not too warmly clad or covered, winter or summer" [...] (Locke's emphasis), he argues, because [...] "bodies <b>will</b> <b>endure</b> anything that from the beginning they are accustomed to." [...] Furthermore, to prevent a child from catching chills and colds, Locke suggests that [...] "his feet to be washed every day in cold water, and to have his shoes so thin that they might leak and let in water whenever he comes near it" [...] (Locke's emphasis). Locke posited that if children were accustomed to having sodden feet, a sudden shower that wet their feet would not cause them to catch a cold. Such advice (whether followed or not) was quite popular; it appears throughout John Newbery's children's books {{in the middle of the}} eighteenth century, for example, the first best-selling children's books in England. Locke also offers specific advice on topics ranging from bed linens to diet to sleeping regimens.|$|E

2500|$|Cave 26 is a worship hall (chaityagriha, 25.34 X 11.52 m) {{similar in}} plan to Cave 19, but much larger and with {{elements}} of a vihara design.

[...] Naming the Holocaust memorial [...] "yad vashem" [...] (Biblical Hebrew [...] yād wā-šêm) conveys the idea of establishing a national depository for the names of Jewish victims who {{have no one to}} carry their name after death.

2500|$|Dry {{suits for}} {{commercial}} and military diving {{tend to be}} heavier and more durable than recreational diving dry suits because they <b>will</b> <b>endure</b> a harsh and abrasive environment, especially if being used for heavy labor such as underwater welding. A boiler suit may be worn over the dry suit for additional protection of the suit. Some commercial dry suits are rated for contaminated environment diving, and when combined with a suitably rated diving helmet can completely isolate and protect the diver from hazardous environments such as sewage pits and chemical storage tanks. These [...] "hazmat suits" [...] are most often made of vulcanized rubber laminated to a cloth liner, which is easier to decontaminate because of its slick surface, than other dry suit materials.|$|E
2500|$|For Fagan, Clark was [...] "one of {{the most}} {{important}} prehistorians of the twentieth century", an individual whose [...] "intellectual influence on archaeology was enormous", producing a [...] "legacy to prehistory [...] <b>will</b> <b>endure</b> for generations".

Coles noted that among continental European scholars, Clark was [...] "the most respected British prehistorian" [...] of his generation. Clark's work was however little known in the United States, where it was eclipsed in the 1960s by the growth of processual archaeology. A less grandiose assessment was left by the archaeologist Pamela Jane Smith, who stated that Clark made [...] "major contributions to the establishment of prehistory as an academic subject at Cambridge University".|$|E
