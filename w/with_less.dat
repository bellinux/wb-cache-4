Upper limits at the 95 % confidence level are presented on {{the product of the}} resonance cross section, branching fraction into dijets, and acceptance, separately for decays into quark–quark, quark–gluon, and gluon–gluon pairs. The data exclude new particles predicted in the following models at the 95 % confidence level: string resonances <b>with</b> mass <b>less</b> than 4. 00 TeV, E 6 diquarks <b>with</b> mass <b>less</b> than 3. 52 TeV, excited quarks <b>with</b> mass <b>less</b> than 2. 49 TeV, axigluons and colorons <b>with</b> mass <b>less</b> than 2. 47 TeV, and W′ bosons <b>with</b> mass <b>less</b> than 1. 51 TeV.

5|$|Although modern fantasy {{may often}} embrace strangeness, the Ice and Fire series is {{generally}} praised {{for what is}} perceived as a sort of medieval realism. Believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre, Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, <b>with</b> <b>less</b> emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters. Though the amount of magic has gradually increased throughout the story, the series is still to end <b>with</b> <b>less</b> overt magic than most contemporary fantasies. In Martin's eyes, literary effective magic needs to represent strange and dangerous forces beyond human comprehension, not advanced alien technologies or formulaic spells. As such, the characters understand only the natural aspects of their world, but not the magical elements like the Others.|$|E
