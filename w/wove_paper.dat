25|$|A special {{printing}} of the 191213 Parcel Post stamps {{was made for}} the Panama-Pacific Exposition held in San Francisco in 1915 from the dies that made the printing plates for this series of stamps. They {{are referred to as}} Die Proofs and are printed directly from the die on soft yellowish <b>wove</b> <b>paper</b> one at a time. Subsequently die proofs have no perforations around them.|$|E
25|$|Zachary Taylor is honored {{on three}} U.S. postage stamps, regular issues. The first Taylor stamp was issued in 1875. This first issue was printed by the Continental Bank Note Company on {{yellowish}} <b>wove</b> <b>paper.</b> When the American Bank Note Company received the federal contract to print postage stamps in 1879 it printed the second Taylor issue (identical in appearance to the 1875 issue) on soft porous paper, using the original dies of Continental Bank Note Company. The engraving of Taylor was modeled after a daguerrotype of Taylor by Civil War photographer Mathew Brady.|$|E
25|$|The postage {{issued in}} the US {{during this time}} was printed by the National Bank Note Company (NBNCo) on white <b>wove</b> <b>paper.</b> The first {{printing}} was issued with 'grills', tiny cuts in the paper to absorb ink. Later reprintings were issued without grilling. The National Bank Note Company's contract expired in 1873, and the Continental Bank Note Company (CBNC) won the contract to continue printing the series and took {{over some of the}} dies and plates used by NBNCo. The new company employed secret marks on the lower-value stamps to distinguish its work from the first printing. The green Washington 3¢ issue was printed in such large quantities that postally used examples remain inexpensive to this day, from pennies to a few dollars, depending on type of cancellation and condition. (The green variety was reprinted again by the American Bank Note Company (AmBNC), also in very large quantities, and issued on July 16, 1881.) The 3-cent Washington design was printed yet a fourth time, in vermillion, in 1887. The 3-cent issues paid the domestic letter rate for a half-ounce letter.|$|E

2500|$|John Baskerville (1706–1775) was a noted type designer, the {{developer}} of <b>wove</b> <b>paper,</b> and typographic businessman in fine printing. His Baskerville font {{is still in}} wide use today. The Birmingham Guild and School of Handicrafts operated a fine arts small-press, the Press of the Birmingham Guild of Handicraft. [...] From 1895 until 1919 this Press produced books in the Kelmscott Press tradition of the Arts and Crafts Movement. George Kynoch's Kynoch Press (1876–1981) was a Birmingham printing house that substantially contributed {{to the development of}} a British typography. The teacher Leonard Jay (1888–1963) made the Birmingham School of Printing a profound influence on a generation of typographers, and set the pattern for printing education worldwide. More recent small-press printers included F.E.Pardoe and David Wishart.|$|E
2500|$|Before 1912 the {{delivery}} of parcels was controlled and handled by private companies, most of whom operated in cities and urban areas where there was more business to be had. Consequently, delivery of parcels to rural areas was inadequate and frequently hindered farmers who needed various supplies, parts and equipment delivered to their remote locations. To meet this demand Congress approved a law on August 24, 1912 creating postal rates for fourth class mail and providing for parcel post service. The Congressional law authorized the U.S. Post Office to produce the various special purpose postage stamps to pay the parcel fees, which became effective on January 1, 1913, the first day the U.S. Parcel Post began service. The 12 stamps were printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing on the flat plate printing press on soft yellowish <b>wove</b> <b>paper</b> made with a single-line watermark bearing the letters 'U S P S' and were perforated with 12 gauge [...] The stamps were designed by Clair Aubrey Houston {{who at the time}} had worked at the Bureau for ten years, while the dies for the individual stamps were produced by several different engravers, with up to four engravers working on each die. The Post Office initially planned to place all dozen stamps on sale before parcel post service began, but Frank Hitchcock, the Postmaster General, deemed the original designs for the 3-cent, 50-cent and 75-cent denominations unsatisfactory, delaying the issue of those values until {{after the first of the}} year. The twelve stamps each bore their own distinctive subject in the vignette and were issued in a single color, [...] "carmine-rose". It was Hitchcock who came up with the idea of printing all the denominations of these stamps in one uniform color. However, because of the common color and similarity in border design Parcel Post stamps during the first six months of use were met with mixed reaction from postal personnel who had difficulty distinguishing the stamps at a glance and often confused the denominations, especially during busy hours. [...] "In an effort to help the stamp clerks an inscription of value in large plain capital letters was added to the [...] margin, next to each plate number. These were first added to plates on January 27, 1913." [...] An example of these large red spelled-out numbers, which appeared on two margins of each pane, can be seen on the illustration of the ten-cent plate block in the section [...] "Other configurations" [...] further down this page. [...] To compound the situation the stamps were larger than ordinary definitive stamps of the period, making it difficult to situate them on smaller parcels with limited space around the address and return address. They were also issued in sheets of 180, with four panes of 45 stamps per sheet, which was an inconvenient number for accounting purposes. By March the Postmaster General was considering using different colors for the individual stamps and a smaller, definitive-sized design [...] (for which plates of the 1 cent, 2 cent and 5 cent denominations were even engraved). Production of the Parcel Post sheets cut into 45 stamps each resulted in a somewhat higher percentage of stamps with straight edges (see image below) than other stamp productions, much to the disappointment of collectors at the time. Some philatelic publishers like Stanley Gibbons were rather unforgiving in their estimation of these new issues, referring to them as [...] "very useless stamps" [...] having an [...] "ugliness" [...] about them.|$|E

The engraved image of Washington was modeled after a painting by Gilbert Stuart.

The stamps were issued in sheets perforated with 12 gauge perforations or 'imperforate', i.e.solid sheets with no perforations.

50|$|Packaging of wool has {{not changed}} much for centuries except that the early wool packs were made from jute, prior {{to the use of}} {{synthetic}} fibres. Jute packs were relatively heavy, weighing several kilograms each. In the 1960s polypropylene and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) packs were manufactured and used to make wool bales. Loose fibres from these packs caused contamination of the wool in the bale and led to nylon becoming the regulation fabric used in Australia, In South Africa <b>woven</b> <b>paper</b> was tested but discontinued in 1973 due to poor wet strength and high cost. Regulation standard white nylon packs now have a 280 mm label sewn onto the top flap of the wool pack for inclusion of the farm brand, wool description, bale number, woolclasser stencil number and bin code. Each bale of wool packs contains 50 packs that measure 70 x 70 cm x 98 cm and have 46 cm flaps.|$|R
