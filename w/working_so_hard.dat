500|$|Reviews of Brothers and Sisters in 1973 {{were mostly}} positive. Bud Scoppa of Rolling Stone deemed the album [...] "no masterpiece, {{but the new}} band has shown that it can carry {{on the work of}} the old, and add the {{appropriate}} new twists when necessary. They've finally discovered a form that feels as natural in the studio as it does in front of their people. It's heartening to see a group of this commercial and critical stature still <b>working</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> at getting even better." [...] Janis Schacht of Circus was very positive, writing, [...] "Never, {{even in the face of}} adversity, do the Allman Brothers quit making strong, hard-driving rock/blues albums.... This is another in the continuing line of quality products from The Allman Brothers Band." [...] Billboard called it [...] "A fine blues/rock set from this fine band, featuring top lead vocals from Gregg Allman and Dickey Betts, and the excellent instrumental fusion for which they are particularly well known." ...|$|E
500|$|In casting Al [...] "Gee" [...] Giardello, Levinson {{decided not}} to make the {{character}} Italian-American like the real-life counterpart Gary D'Addario, but rather cast Yaphet Kotto and made the character a Sicilian-African American. Kotto, who turned down two feature film offers to accept the Homicide role, was extremely impressed with Levinson's choices for the character, saying, [...] "They had the daring to make the artistic choice without prejudice of any kind. I don't think there's another network show on the air with this sort of cast composition." [...] Kotto struggled at first with the show's production style and constantly moving camera style, which flustered him and made him forget his lines. Levinson had to personally reassure him that he could handle the part. Clark Johnson was cast as Meldrick Lewis, and Jon Polito as his partner, Steve Crosetti. When Polito first auditioned, he read the role of a Polish cop, then did a second reading for an Irish role based on Detective Sergeant Terrence McLarney. He was cast in the McLarney role, but it was rewritten to an Italian character for Polito. The actor found working on Homicide intense and demanding, claiming, [...] "Everybody's <b>working</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard.</b> This is much more of a theater atmosphere." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 1, 2014, Mikulski {{introduced}} the Paycheck Fairness Act (S. 2199; 113th Congress), [...] {{a measure that}} aims to strengthen the Fair Labor Standards Act's protections against pay inequalities based on gender. It is a bill that [...] "punishes employers for retaliating against workers who share wage information, puts the justification burden on employers as to why someone is paid less and allows workers to sue for punitive damages of wage discrimination". Mikulski said that [...] "it brings {{tears to my eyes}} to know women are <b>working</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> and being paid less" [...] and that [...] "it makes me emotional when I hear that... I get angry, I get outraged and I get volcanic".|$|E

5000|$|At {{the end of}} the story, Stanford's father {{reveals that}} he has been <b>working</b> <b>so</b> {{incredibly}} <b>hard</b> all the time because he was hoping for a promotion - which his boss granted him. However, the promotion required a relocation to New York. Stanford protests angrily, but his father tells him that he didn't take the job. He says that he just recently realized how distant he became from his family, and that wants to reconnect with them. Now that he had rejected the promotion, he says, he would probably have a lot more free time on his hands to spend with Stanford. The book ends with Stanford thinking, [...] "I have so much to tell my dad." [...] Later that night, he falls asleep wearing Alan Scott BK620s, what he always wanted the whole summer.|$|R
2500|$|Parks {{has been}} {{critical}} of the flower power movement, which occurred {{toward the end of the}} decade, saying [...] "Rock became a corporate classification, just like the blues. They took off its sexual organs. Some people got paid a lot of money to bottle the rebellion of the '60s, and that's when it started to mean zero to me." [...] He added, [...] "To me, 1969 really suggested the death knell of the counter-culture revolution. The terrible event of Charles Manson showed the cultism of the period; I was always wary of crowds. I didn't go to Woodstock. I didn't want to be in a mudflat waiting to get into a portable toilet. I thought it was a terrible idea. So I stayed at my office at Warner Bros.…I don't even know what happened around then, for many reasons. One is I was <b>working</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> and was too busy to really get totally turned around by what other people were doing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite his esteem in {{the writing}} community, Serling found the series {{difficult}} to sell. Few critics felt that science fiction could transcend empty escapism and enter the realm of adult drama. In a September 22, 1959, interview with Serling, Mike Wallace asked a question illustrative of the times: [...] "...ou're going to be, obviously, <b>working</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> on The Twilight Zone that, in essence, {{for the time being}} and for the foreseeable future, you've given up on writing anything important for television, right?" [...] While Serling's appearances on the show became one of its most distinctive features, with his clipped delivery still widely imitated today, he was reportedly nervous about it and had to be persuaded to appear on camera. Serling often steps {{into the middle of the}} action while the characters remain oblivious to him, but on one notable occasion, they are aware of his presence: In the episode [...] "A World of His Own", a writer (Keenan Wynn) with the power to alter his reality objects to Serling's narration, and promptly erases Serling from the show.|$|E
2500|$|When {{discussion}} regarding {{her second}} album began, Duff {{said she wanted}} to work with the same team of producers and songwriters with whom she worked on Metamorphosis. [...] " [...] made me feel so comfortable and so secure with myself. I loved working with them. I have a great relationship with them. I talk to them ... They {{knew what was going on}} in my life, what I was going through ... and how I feel inside", Duff said. For songs she did not co-write, Duff discussed her experiences and feelings with the writers and ask them to write songs about them. Members of the creative team behind Metamorphosis who returned for Hilary Duff include Charlie Midnight, John Shanks and Kara DioGuardi (who collaborated on the commercially released singles), Andre Recke, Marc Swersky and Duff's sister Haylie. Hilary said, [...] "I do have a lot to say, and I have a lot going on inside that sometimes is buried and hidden because I'm <b>working</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard,</b> and I don't have time to think about it. But if we sit down and we talk about it and I tell her how I feel and she writes, it'll be good." ...|$|E
5000|$|The post-WWII years saw {{the burgeoning}} of the American {{corporation}} {{and in particular}} major R&D labs, for example, Tushman examined the [...] "communication activity of all the professionals (N=345) in the R&D facility of large mid-Western U.S Corporation. The laboratory is isolated {{from the rest of}} the corporation and is divided into seven departments (divisional laboratories). The departments are, in turn, organized into separate project areas. The projects were stable over the course of the research and each respondent was a member of only one project."With this increase in spending on R&D, there was increased interest in the effectiveness of that spending and how to improve the efficiency of commercial research. Of course, all the academic research presented anonymous data from the firms with which they had been <b>working</b> <b>so</b> it is <b>hard</b> to know who the participating laboratories were.|$|R
5000|$|Andy Kellman of AllMusic {{praised the}} {{production}} and lyrical qualities for being more hi-standard compared to Houston's previous efforts and for the maturity in his vocal delivery, saying that [...] "he works the more romantic sentiments with enough conviction to indicate that he has more life experiences from which to draw." [...] Joshua Alston of Vibe saw Houston's vocal work {{similar to that of}} Sam Cooke, saying that he [...] "sounds sexier when he isn't <b>working</b> <b>so</b> damn <b>hard</b> at it. If only he had a clue." [...] Adam Pearthree of Okayplayer commended the mature approach the album takes with its songs but found it forgettable, along with Houston's identity crisis in his vocal performance, concluding that, [...] "With stronger song selection Marques Houston could still come up with the adult oriented album he wants, but as of now, Veteran simply falls short." [...] Mike Joseph of PopMatters also found {{the production and}} songwriting adequate at best but felt it was too reminiscent of other established R&B artists, saying that [...] "The moments you notice on Veteran are the ones that remind you of other artists. Now in his mid-twenties, it’s hard to say whether Houston will ever develop the singular personality that will elevate his career to the next level of hitmaker status." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It was {{scrapped}} at {{the last}} second. The band was touring in Europe {{at the time and}} made the painful decision there - in Italy or France I think. The album was complete and about to be mastered. [...] "Design" [...] was to be the last song on the album - after Caspian. It was a bizarre version that no one ever really got used to. It was funny though - the second they got back to the States and played it in their new acoustic setup it was as strong as ever. It just couldn't be captured in the studio for whatever reason. Cutting {{it was one of those}} great decisions - after <b>working</b> <b>so</b> long and <b>hard</b> on the song, sacrificing it for the good of the album took a very wide focus - as much thought went into cutting it as went into recording it." ...|$|R
2500|$|After reigning {{almost twenty}} years, working {{at least ten}} hours a day, Christina had what some have {{interpreted}} as a nervous breakdown. She suffered with high blood pressure, complained about bad eyesight and pain in her neck. Grégoire François Du Rietz, since 1642 the court physician, was called when she suddenly collapsed in 1651. In February 1652 the French doctor Pierre Bourdelot arrived in Stockholm. Unlike most doctors of that time, he held no faith in blood-letting; instead, he ordered sufficient sleep, warm baths and healthy meals, as opposed to Christina's hitherto ascetic way of life. She was only twenty-five, and advising that she should take more pleasure in life, Bourdelot asked her to stop studying and <b>working</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> and to remove the books from her apartments. For years, Christina knew by heart all the sonnets from the Ars Amatoria and was keen on the works by Martial and Petronius. The physician showed her the 16erotic sonnets of Pietro Aretino, which he kept secretly in his luggage. By subtle means Bourdelot undermined her principles. She now became an Epicurean. Her mother and de la Gardie were very much against the activities of Bourdelot and tried to convince her to change her attitude towards him; Bourdelot returned to France in 1653 [...] "laden in riches and curses".|$|E

50|$|To {{record the}} album, the band flew out to Los Angeles, {{and worked with}} {{producer}} Tony Hoffer. According to drummer Colin Newton, the band had been: taking our time recording the songs for the album and spent three months going backwards and forwards between studios in L.A., {{and a lot of}} the time we were too intent on having a good time rather than <b>working</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>so</b> eventually that’s why we had to go back out and re-record everything and we finally got it finished in October. Along the way as well, we’d been hearing that the record company had been having doubts about the songs on the album, so that final trip to L.A. seemed to be the re-awakening of us as a band.|$|R
5000|$|Croce's wife Ingrid Croce has an autobiographical cookbook, Thyme In A Bottle, {{in which}} she writes {{interesting}} anecdotes about Jim. What she wrote about [...] "I'll Have To Say 'I Love You' in a Song" [...] is this."One weekend, after being {{on the road for}} many months, Jim got a chance to come home to relax with his family. We settled in to enjoy our time alone together. Though Jim was expecting company the next day, avoiding confrontation he never told me that we were to be joined by an entire film crew! The next morning, 15 people from Acorn Productions descended upon our house to record a promotional film of Jim Croce at Home on the Farm."I prepared breakfast, lunch and dinner for the whole film crew and after the group left, I questioned Jim about our finances. After {{a year and a half}} of his <b>working</b> <b>so</b> very <b>hard</b> on the road, we were barely making ends meet, but Jim wouldn't talk about it. He hated questions as much as he hated confrontation, especially about money. He stormed out of our bedroom and went down to the kitchen table to brood. The next morning he woke me gently by singing his new song. 'Every time I tried to tell you the words just came out wrong. So I'll have to say [...] "I love you" [...] in a song.'" ...|$|R

2500|$|Effort-Reward Imbalance Model: This model {{focuses on}} the {{reciprocal}} relationship between efforts and rewards at work. [...] "More specifically, the ERI Model claims that work characterized by both high efforts and low rewards represents a reciprocity deficit between high ‘costs’ and low ‘gains’, which could elicit negative emotions in exposed employees. The accompanying feelings may cause sustained strain reactions. <b>So,</b> <b>working</b> <b>hard</b> without receiving adequate appreciation or being treated fairly are examples of a stressful imbalance. Another assumption of the ERI Model concerns individual differences {{in the experience of}} effort-reward imbalance. It is assumed that employees characterized by a motivational pattern of excessive job-related commitment and a high need for approval (i.e., overcommitment) will respond with more strain reactions to an effort-reward imbalance, in comparison with less overcommitted people." ...|$|R

60|$|Ting-a-ling slipped along {{close to}} the wall, {{so that he would}} not be stepped on by anybody; and having reached the palace, he climbed up a long {{trailing}} vine, into one of the lower windows. There he saw the vast audience-chamber filled with people, shouting, and calling, and talking, all at once. The grand vizier was on the wide platform of the throne, making a speech, but the uproar was so great that not one word of it could Ting-a-ling hear. The King himself was by his throne, putting on the bulky boots, which he only wore when he went to battle, and which made him look so terrible that a person could hardly see him without trembling. The last time that he had worn those boots, as Ting-a-ling very well knew, he had made war on a neighboring country, and had defeated all the armies, killed all the people, torn down all the towns and cities, and every house and cottage, and ploughed up the whole country, and sowed it with thistles, so that it could never be used as a country any more. So Ting-a-ling thought that as the King was putting on his war boots, something very great was surely about to happen. Hearing a fizzing noise behind him, he turned around, and there was the Prince in the court-yard, grinding his sword on a grindstone, which was turned by two slaves, who were <b>working</b> away <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> and fast that they were nearly ready to drop. Then he knew that wonderful things were surely coming to pass, for in ordinary times the Prince never lifted his finger to do anything for himself.|$|R

30|$|Third, {{both the}} reward and {{punishment}} systems are different for senior editors and junior editors. In {{terms of the}} reward system, senior editors easily get promoted. In the publishing industry, senior editors are more respected due to their seniority instead of their professional skills and abilities because seniority is widely honored according to the Chinese tradition. As for the punishment system, on the one hand, senior editors, most of who lack marketing knowledge, can hardly make enough profit specified in their contracts. They are, however, allowed to stay in publishing houses by the managers {{even if they are}} not <b>working</b> <b>hard,</b> <b>so</b> long as they do not make any trouble for the managers’ control and management of other editors. On the other hand, the profit that junior editors generate for publishing houses is carefully calculated and mainly determines their incomes. That is to say, the annual incomes of junior editors can be largely reduced if they fail to earn the amount of profit specified in their contracts. As such, {{there is no doubt that}} junior editors experience tremendous work pressure to ensure that their books sell well, and they need to be extremely sensitive to the demands of readers.|$|R
