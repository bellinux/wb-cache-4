5|$|The {{government}} {{department responsible for}} the NHS is the Department of Health, headed by the Secretary of State for Health, <b>who</b> <b>sits</b> in the British Cabinet. Most of the expenditure of the Department of Health is spent on the NHS—£98.6billion was spent in 2008–2009. In recent years the private sector has been increasingly used to provide more NHS services despite opposition by doctors and trade unions. The average life expectancy of people in England is 77.5 years for males and 81.7 years for females, the highest of the four countries of the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|As {{prescribed}} in the Jayakhya-Samhita, Vaikuntha Chaturmurti may be {{depicted as}} riding his vehicle (vahana) Garuda too, though {{these images are}} rarer. In this configuration, the god holds a sword, a lotus, a mace or a conch and the chakra. Generally, on four feathers of Garuda sit four female figures, two {{on either side of}} Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. The identity of the female figures is uncertain. They are interpreted as two goddesses (possibly consorts of Vishnu - Lakshmi and Bhumi) and two female attendants. The Jayakhya-Samhita mentions that four goddesses Lakshmi, Kirti, Jaya and Maya as the female counterparts of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. Rarely, Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is accompanied with his consort Lakshmi, <b>who</b> <b>sits</b> on his left thigh. This form is called Lakshmi Vaikuntha in the Jayakhya-Samhita.|$|E
5|$|Scotland is {{represented}} in the British House of Commons by 59 MPs elected from territory-based Scottish constituencies. In the 2017 general election, the SNP won 35 of the 59 seats. Th{{is represented}} a significant decline from the 2015 general election, when the SNP won 56 seats. Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat parties also represent Scottish constituencies in the House of Commons. The next United Kingdom general election is scheduled for 5 May 2022.

5|$|There {{is also an}} {{indeterminate}} {{relationship between}} the figures in the spandrels and the lunettes beneath them. Because of {{the constraints of the}} triangular shape, in each spandrel the figures are seated on the ground. In six of the eight spandrels the compositions resemble traditional depictions of the Flight into Egypt. Of the two remaining, one shows a woman with shears trimming the neck of a garment she is making while her toddler looks on. The Biblical woman who is recorded as making a new garment for her child is Hannah, the mother of Samuel, whose child went to live in the temple, and indeed, the male figure in the background is wearing a distinctive hat that might suggest that of a priest. The other figure who differs from the rest is a young woman <b>who</b> <b>sits</b> staring out of the picture with prophetic intensity. Her open eyes have been closed in the restoration.|$|E

40|$|English has a {{function}} as self development means {{to acquire the}} knowledge, so that the students are growing up to be smart citizen, having skill in English. Getting good English achievement {{is very important for}} them in order to graduate from school and {{the most important thing is}} to face globalization era. Many ways are done in order to reach that goal effectively and effeciently. Various Strategies of teaching are done by the teacher, for example, the teachers manage the students’ seat position in learning a certain subject. In classroom seats are organized in rows. Because of that condition, the students <b>who</b> <b>sit</b> in front and center usually get high achievement and the students <b>who</b> <b>sit</b> at the back row usually get low achievement so that seat position must be made as effective as possible. Based on this fact, the writer tried to answer the following questions: Is there any significant difference of English achievement based on students’ seat position between the students <b>who</b> <b>sit</b> in the action zone (in the front) and those <b>who</b> <b>sit</b> at the back row of the second year of SMAN I Ngunut Tulungagung. The research design of this study was a Comparative by using Quantitative research analysis. The target population of this study was the students <b>who</b> <b>sit</b> in the action zone (in the front) and those <b>who</b> <b>sit</b> at the back row of the second year of SMAN I Ngunut Tulungagung in the 2008 ­ 2009 academic year. The researcher took the sample among the population randomly using lottery. From the lottery class II IPS 1 and II IPS 2 were selected as the sample. The data of this research was taken from students’ English achievement record reports <b>who</b> <b>sit</b> in the action zone (in the front) and those <b>who</b> <b>sit</b> at the back row. To test the hypothesis the t­test formula was ased. In analyzing the respondents, five methods were used; (1) finding means of each variable, (2) finding standard deviation, (3) finding standard error, (4) standard error of the difference, and (5) finding the t­value. The result of the calculation of t­value in this research was 4. 11 while the value of a significant level of 5...|$|R

Instruments, such as the Saraswati veena and/or venu flute, can be occasionally found as a rhythmic accompaniment, but usually, a vocalist {{is supported by a}} violin player (<b>who</b> <b>sits</b> on his/her left). The rhythm accompanist is usually a mridangam player (<b>who</b> <b>sits</b> on the other side, facing the violin player). However, other percussion instruments such as the ghatam, kanjira and morsing frequently also accompany the main percussion instrument and play in an almost contrapuntal fashion along with the beats.|$|E
