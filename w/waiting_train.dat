5|$|An initial {{meeting on}} May 30 nearly ended in disaster. Waite and several local civic leaders called union {{president}} Calderwood and mine owners Hagerman and Moffat {{to a conference}} in a meeting hall {{on the campus of}} Colorado College in Colorado Springs. Talks were under way and proceeding well when a mob of local citizens attempted to storm the building. Blaming Calderwood and Waite for the violence in Cripple Creek, they intended to lynch both men. As a local judge distracted the mob, Calderwood and Waite escaped out a rear door and onto the governor's <b>waiting</b> <b>train.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{arrival at}} the {{terminus}} the mourners would be led either {{to one of the}} dedicated first class waiting rooms (for first and second class funerals) or to the communal third class waiting room. The coffin would be discreetly unloaded from the hearse and sent to the platform level by lift. Those attending first and second class funerals would be permitted to watch the coffins being loaded onto the train if they so wished. (After the relocation to the new London terminus in 1902, some funeral services would be held in a Chapelle Ardente on platform level, for those cases where mourners were unable to make the journey to Brookwood.) Each door of the <b>waiting</b> <b>train</b> would be labelled with the name of the deceased, to ensure all passengers travelled with the correct funeral party; the names of the deceased being carried on the train would be called in turn, and that person's mourners would board the train.|$|E
25|$|The Texas {{arrived at}} Hampton Roads at 11:00 A.M. local time on December 25, 1899. The 151 coffins were {{offloaded}} by U.S. Navy personnel {{and transferred to}} funeral barges. Bluejackets accompanied each funeral barge until it reached the railroad pier. The bluejackets transferred the coffins from the barges to the <b>waiting</b> <b>train</b> while a Marine honor guard stood watch. A unit of six bluejackets and six Marines provided an honor guard aboard the train. Jeremiah Shea, fireman who was aboard the Maine on its fateful night, {{was one of the}} six sailors. Accompanying the sailors and marines were Father Chidwick and a lieutenant from the Texas. The funeral train consisted of four baggage cars and a vestibule car with the seats removed. Transferral of the dead from the Texas to the wharf took much longer than anticipated, although only an hour was needed to load the funeral train. Due to the delays, the train did not depart Hampton Roads until 10:00 P.M. local time on December 26. Expected to arrive at 8:00 A.M. on December 27, it did not do so until 11:00 A.M. Captain Sigsbee did not take the funeral train to Washington, but rather rode a steamboat up the Potomac River to reach the city faster.|$|E

2500|$|On January 19, {{the trek}} {{continued}} to Terijoki. Once the deportees had arrived, and after trudging through a heavy snowstorm, a parlay was conducted under white flags of truce between Berkman, guarded by the Finns, and the Russians, {{out on the}} ice of the frozen Systerbak River, which separated the Finnish and Bolshevist lines. Things being settled, the [...] "undesirables" [...] then crossed over into Russia at 2 pm, Berkman and Goldman waiting until everyone else had safely crossed. All were enthusiastically received with cheers and a band playing the Russian national anthem. In the war-wrecked town of Bielo-Ostrov, which overlooked the stream, they boarded a <b>waiting</b> <b>train</b> which took them to Petrograd.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{railroad}} was complete {{except for the}} viaduct, trains ran to the viaduct abutments where passengers would exit and descend the embankment. [...] Passengers crossed the river on a hand-operated cable ferry, boarded horse-drawn carriages on a temporary wagonway to cross the valley, then ascended the embankment to board a <b>waiting</b> <b>train</b> at the opposite abutment. [...] The approach walls {{are believed to have}} supported the temporary (covered) train platforms to which wooden staircases were attached. [...] These wooden staircases led from the train platforms to stone [...] (with railings) for passengers to descended to the valley floor. [...] A [...] from 1871 may have captured one of those walls (bottom left), at the north end, west side of the viaduct. [...] The approach walls may have also served as foundations for the guard houses during World War II.|$|E

50|$|Some {{segments}} of the old railbed can still be traced out in some places in the desert, but much has now been covered by housing developments of Yermo. The best place to see traces of the old line are {{at the site of}} the former Waterloo Mine, where a large ore bin had dumped silver ore into the <b>waiting</b> <b>trains</b> below.

60|$|At {{night the}} bunched {{electrics}} lit up that distressful palace {{of all the}} luxuries, and they fared sumptuously, swinging on through the emptiness of abject desolation. Now they heard the swish of a water-tank, and the guttural voice of a China-man, the clink-clink of hammers that tested the Krupp steel wheels, and the oath of a tramp chased off the rear platform; now the solid crash of coal shot into the tender; and now a beating back of noises as they flew past a <b>waiting</b> <b>train.</b> Now they looked out into great abysses, a trestle purring beneath their tread, or up to rocks that barred out half the stars. Now scaur and ravine changed and rolled back to jagged mountains on the horizon's edge, and now broke into hills lower and lower, till at last came the true plains.|$|E

And the wagon-lit, booked to Syracuse, calmly left stranded in the station of Messina, to go no further. All get out and find yourselves rooms for the night in vile Messina. Syracuse or no Syracuse, Malta boat or no Malta boat. We are the Ferrovia dello Stato.|$|E

50|$|Many {{soldiers}} from New England and New Jersey came through Philadelphia heading south.

50|$|When trains run in {{opposite}} directions on a single-track railroad, meeting points ("meets") are scheduled, at which each train must wait for the other at a passing place.

In addition, the train carrying the flags gives eight blasts on the whistle as it approaches. The <b>waiting</b> <b>train</b> must return eight blasts before the flag carrying train may proceed.|$|E
