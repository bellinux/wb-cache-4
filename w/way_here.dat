25|$|After {{the release}} of On My <b>Way</b> <b>Here,</b> Aiken left RCA and later signed with Decca Records. His first album with Decca, Tried and True, was {{released}} June 1, 2010, and his second, Steadfast, was released March 26, 2012.|$|E

In Fife, the highway intersects SR 99, {{a small portion}} of US 99 through the Puget Sound region, and then enters Federal <b>Way.</b> <b>Here</b> the freeway intersects the western terminus of SR 18, which has been proposed to be renumbered to I-605 after being upgraded to Interstate standards.|$|E

Because of visual perspective, about 100,000years from now, these stars will reach a final vanishing point and slowly disappear among the countless stars of the Milky <b>Way.</b> <b>Here</b> this once bright yellow star will fall below naked-eye visibility somewhere in the faint present day southern constellation of Telescopium. This unusual location results from the fact that Alpha Centauri's orbit around the galactic centre is highly tilted with respect to the plane of the Milky Way.|$|E
25|$|Aiken {{began his}} rise to fame placing {{second on the}} second season of the {{television}} program American Idol in 2003. He and the 2003 Winner Ruben Studdard were both offered recording contracts by RCA Records, and his multi-platinum debut album Measure of a Man was released in October 2003. He released four more albums on the RCA label: Merry Christmas with Love (2004), A Thousand Different Ways (2006), and the Christmas EP, All is Well (2006). His fourth studio album (the first album of original material since 2003's Measure of a Man), On My <b>Way</b> <b>Here,</b> was released on May 6, 2008.|$|E
25|$|Other methods address {{different}} types of DNA modifications using the MinION platform. Stoiber et al examined 4-methylcytosine (4mC) and 6-methyladenine (6mA), along with 5mC, and also created a software to directly visualize the raw MinION data in human-friendly <b>way.</b> <b>Here</b> they found that in E. coli, which has a known methylome, event windows of 5 base pairs long {{can be used to}} divide and statistically analyze the raw MinION electrical signals. A straightforward Mann-Whitney U test can detect modified portions of the E. coli sequence, as well as further split the modifications into 4mC, 6mA or 5mC regions.|$|E

25|$|Mushrooms can {{be grown}} on logs placed {{outdoors}} in stacks or piles, as has been done for hundreds of years. Sterilization is not performed in this method. Since production may be unpredictable and seasonal, less than 5% of commercially sold mushrooms are produced this <b>way.</b> <b>Here,</b> tree logs are inoculated with spawn, then allowed to grow as they would in wild conditions. Fruiting, or pinning, is triggered by seasonal changes, or by briefly soaking the logs in cool water. Shiitake and oyster mushrooms have traditionally been produced using the outdoor log technique, although controlled techniques such as indoor tray growing or artificial logs made of compressed substrate have been substituted.|$|E
25|$|Those who are {{suffering}} most keenly, and who have lost most, either of their children by death or their possessions by fire and sword, such as those reconcentrated women in the camps, have the most conspicuous patience, and never express a wish that their men should {{be the ones to}} give way. It must be fought out now, they think, to the bitter end. It is a very costly business upon which England has embarked, and even at such a cost hardly the barest necessities can be provided, and no comforts. It is so strange to think that every tent contains a family, and every family is in troubleâ€“loss behind, poverty in front, sickness, privation and death in the present. But they are very good, and say they have agreed to be cheerful and {{make the best of it}} all. The Mafeking camp folk were very surprised to hear that English women cared a rap about them or their suffering. It has done them a lot of good to hear that real sympathy is felt for them at home, and so I am glad I fought my <b>way</b> <b>here,</b> if only for that reason.|$|E
500|$|Commitment is an {{important}} characteristic of the ethicist. Commitments are made by being {{an active participant in}} society, rather than a detached observer or outsider. The ethicist has a strong sense of responsibility, duty, honor and respect for his friendships, family, and career. Judge Vilhelm uses the example of marriage as an example of an ethical institution requiring strong commitment and responsibility. Whereas the aesthete would be bored by the repetitive nature of marriage (e.g. married to one person only), the ethicist believes in the necessity of self-denial (e.g. self-denying unmitigated pleasure) in order to uphold one's obligations. Kierkegaard had Judge William speak again in his 1845 book Stages on Life's <b>Way.</b> <b>Here</b> he described the enemies the single individual faces when trying to make a commitment, probability and the outcome.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} given a budget of $4.5 million ($ in [...] dollars), modest by Hollywood {{standards}} at the time. Philip Hobel said it took about a year to secure the financing from EMI Films, whose major 1981 release, Honky Tonk Freeway, had been a box office failure. For the primary location, Rosa Lee's home and motel/gas station business, Beresford imposed one requirement: that no other buildings or large manmade structures be visible from it. The filmmakers eventually decided on a property that had been sitting abandoned by a Waxahachie highway. Mary Ann Hobel said the owner, when approached about its availability, immediately handed over the keys: [...] "We said, 'Don't you want a contract, something in writing?' And he said, 'We don't do things that <b>way</b> <b>here.</b>|$|E

The single {{is his first}} original song since the release of his album On My <b>Way</b> <b>Here</b> in 2008. On March 27, 2012 Aiken released Steadfast, a new album of previous recordings and songs only sung in concerts. The album debuted at #120 on the Billboard 200 chart with sales of 4,000 in the first week.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{for general}} rings, for a {{principal}} ideal domain, {{the properties of}} individual elements are strongly tied to {{the properties of the}} ring as a whole.

Aiken found a song, [...] "On My Way Here", written by OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder, that struck a chord with him and became the inspiration for the album's theme in addition to the album title. For a cohesive sound, Aiken chose Mark 'Kipper' Eldridge to produce the entire album. On My <b>Way</b> <b>Here</b> was released May 6, 2008, on the RCA label.|$|E

While most of the Romance languages put the article before the noun, Romanian has its own way, by putting the article after the noun, e.g. lupul ("the wolf" [...] â€“ from *lupum illum) and omul ("the man" [...] â€“ *homo illum), possibly a result of its membership in the Balkan sprachbund.|$|E

A possible new Hugo live show was hinted in July 2014. Hugo Games is owned and managed by Henry Mallet, and was valued at DKK 56 million and generating an annual income of about DKK 10 million as estimated in September 2014 when the company was listed for investment as HUGO NewHold ApS.|$|E
