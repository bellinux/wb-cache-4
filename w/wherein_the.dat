5|$|The Upanishad is {{presented}} as a discourse between the Vedic sage Ashvalayana and the god Brahma, <b>wherein</b> <b>the</b> Ashvalayana asks Brahma for Brahma-vidya, that is the knowledge of ultimate reality Brahman.|$|E
5|$|Another {{way of life}} of chemotrophs in {{the absence}} of {{possible}} electron acceptors is fermentation, <b>wherein</b> <b>the</b> electrons taken from the reduced substrates are transferred to oxidised intermediates to generate reduced fermentation products (e.g., lactate, ethanol, hydrogen, butyric acid). Fermentation is possible, because the energy content of the substrates is higher than that of the products, which allows the organisms to synthesise ATP and drive their metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 10 states {{meditation}} practice perfects one's {{ability to}} concentrate, <b>wherein</b> <b>the</b> object one concentrates on becomes {{the one of}} attachment, of oneness and one feels one's identity with it. Verses 10.6–15 suggest that one must concentrate on self as the supreme self, oneness with Brahman in everything, and this process of attachment of one's individual self to the supreme self leads to oneness and liberation.|$|E

It was created both {{to serve as a}} spiritual successor to Hey You, Pikachu!—a similar digital pet-type game <b>wherein</b> <b>the</b> player plays with a Pikachu—and to promote the Nintendo e-Reader peripheral device. The game included three e-Reader-compatible cards, but not the e-Reader device itself. When scanned, the cards upload new templates for the player to paint and for Smeargle to critique.|$|E

5|$|The Sanskrit text of this Upanishad has six chapters. Sage Yajnavalkya answers {{questions}} in the first five, <b>wherein</b> <b>the</b> questions are posed by Brihaspati, Atri, students of Brahman-Atman, King Janaka and by Atri again. The last chapter lists the names of famous sages who were model sannyasis (renunciates).|$|E

5|$|The text {{opens with}} a {{discussion}} of virtues and lifestyle of a yogi, with 70 verses in the first chapter dedicated primarily to Yamas and 19 in second dedicated to Niyamas. The yoga postures with breathing and cleansing exercises are described in 149 verses of the third through seventh chapters, <b>wherein</b> <b>the</b> text asserts that these yoga exercises help the yogi master his senses and achieve awareness of his body.|$|E

5|$|There is no {{consensus}} on pacifism among modern Hindu scholars. The conflict between pacifistic interpretations of Ahimsa and the theories of just war prescribed by the Gita has been resolved by some scholars such as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, as being an allegory, <b>wherein</b> <b>the</b> battlefield is the soul and Arjuna, the war is within each human being, where man's higher impulses struggle against his own evil impulses.|$|E
5|$|After Gasketball 2012 release, Boxleiter and Wohlwend {{planned a}} celebratory road {{trip to a}} game jam in Victoria, British Columbia. The game did not fare as expected, so Boxleiter used the two-day jam to create the core mirror {{reflection}} mechanics of what would become TouchTone, though it would take two years of sporadic work to finalize {{the remainder of the}} game. In TouchTone, the player monitors phone calls as part of a government surveillance program to find public threats. The story is told through a series of reflection puzzles <b>wherein</b> <b>the</b> player swipes the screen to reflect a beam around a room to its intended destination.|$|E
5|$|Bars and {{restaurants}} are considered strictly liable for their patrons' behavior, and liquor licenses can be suspended or revoked if a customer engages in illegal activity (e.g. fighting, public urination) after drinking. New Jersey law recognizes both dram shop liability and social host liability, <b>wherein</b> <b>the</b> server of alcohol to visibly intoxicated persons or minors is liable {{if that person}} then causes death or injury to a third party in an alcohol-related automobile collision or other accident. In order to mitigate liability, the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) grants licensed establishments the right to exclude any patron for any reason, but warns business against violating civil rights laws.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{complaints}} from bar owners about {{their inability to}} obtain liability insurance, the state passed legislation in 1987 to limit liability to cases where the server could have realistically known that the patron was underage or intoxicated, and to limit lawsuits to types of injuries that are foreseeable. The act also instituted the legal standard of comparative negligence in these cases, <b>wherein</b> <b>the</b> monetary damages against a licensed establishment can be reduced if {{there are others who}} are also negligent (e.g. the patron, other bars). Additional legislation passed in 1987 substantially limited the liability of social hosts for adult guests.|$|E
5|$|Besides the budget, another {{measure that}} failed to pass in the 2002 session was a bill to {{eliminate}} {{the death penalty for}} juveniles. The precedent for the juvenile death penalty had been set in the 1989 Supreme Court case of Stanford v. Kentucky, <b>wherein</b> <b>the</b> court ruled that Kevin Stanford could be executed for the 1981 rape, sodomy, and murder of a gas station attendant in Jefferson County, Kentucky, even though Stanford was only 17 {{at the time of the}} crime. In 2003, Patton announced he would commute Stanford's sentence. Patton did oversee the execution of two adult prisoners in 1997 and 1999, making him the first Kentucky governor to do so since 1962.|$|E
5|$|Cats are obligate carnivores: their {{physiology}} {{has evolved}} to efficiently process meat, {{and they have}} difficulty digesting plant matter. In contrast to omnivores such as rats, which only require about 4% protein in their diet, about 20% of a cat's diet must be protein. Cats are unusually dependent on a constant supply of the amino acid arginine, and a diet lacking arginine causes marked weight loss and can be rapidly fatal. Another unusual feature is that the cat cannot produce taurine, with taurine deficiency causing macular degeneration, <b>wherein</b> <b>the</b> cat's retina slowly degenerates, causing irreversible blindness.|$|E

He was summoned {{to appear before the}} legislature, but opted to respond to their charges in writing instead. Incensed, the legislature attempted to removed him from office, but the vote of 5935 fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. In October 1823, Clark's decision was upheld by the Kentucky Court of Appeals; that decision touched off the Old Court-New Court controversy, <b>wherein</b> <b>the</b> legislature attempted to abolish the Court of Appeals {{and replace it with a}} more sympathetic court.|$|E
5|$|Curiously, {{the legend}} {{has not been}} {{reported}} by any Byzantine author. However, {{an investigation of the}} surviving holes <b>wherein</b> <b>the</b> metal letters were riveted verified its accuracy. It also showed that the first line stood on the western face of the arch, while the second on the eastern. According to the current view, this refers to the usurper Joannes (r. 423–425), while according to the supporters of the traditional view, it indicates the gate's construction as a free-standing triumphal arch in 388–391 to commemorate the defeat of the usurper Magnus Maximus (r. 385–388), and which was only later incorporated into the Theodosian Walls.|$|E
