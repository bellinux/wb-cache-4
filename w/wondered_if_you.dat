6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Mr. Redwing. [...] "Is that {{whom you}} fellows are looking for? I <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had lost something. What {{do you want}} with Old Mr. Toad?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's like meeting {{somebody}} {{out of a}} dream," [...] said Molly. [...] "I have sometimes <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were real. Everything that happened that night was so like a dream." ...|$|E

6000|$|Dr. FRYE. Is this Dr. Jonathan Pindar? I <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were a relation--(he {{glances at}} ASHER)--but I wasn't {{looking for you}} in Foxon Falls. If you have {{something}} to suggest--? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I wondered, {{and before}} the first waltz, too, when we were {{introduced}} and shook hands--I <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were the man. Those were the very words that flashed into my mind.--IS HE THE MAN?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Mr. Shelton!" [...] he said, [...] "I <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{could tell}} me what tips I ought to give the {{servants}} here; after ten years away I 've forgotten all about that sort of thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you {{are still}} {{determined}} on directing operations in person? I was commencing to <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had any reason for modifying your plans." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{had listened}} eagerly, as I say; {{and it was}} her nature to {{understand}} quickly. [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> appreciate what <b>you</b> say. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> do, you take a great responsibility." ...|$|R
6000|$|So must your hapless {{minstrel}} fare, By {{hill and}} hollow violing; He flings a ditty on the air, He <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> hear him sing! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{have you}} been doing ever since you left Plescow? I inquired after you the other day, when our troops broke up Schlippenbach's force on the Embach. I found you were not among the prisoners, and I <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were among the killed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here she is!" [...] {{said one}} of the workmen. [...] "We <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were coming after all. Come along; we must be quick to get a good place... Well, how is he? Sleeping well still? Of course, we don't want to drag 'ee away if--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, indeed, Isaac. I {{have never}} forgotten," [...] {{answered}} Betty, softly. [...] "Only last night I spoke {{of you and}} <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were living. And now you are here. Oh, I am so happy!" [...] The quivering lips and the dark eyes bright with tears spoke eloquently of her joy.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{will believe}} what I {{have to tell}} you, Miss Townshead," [...] he commenced, and stopped when the rancher turned towards him, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{would listen}} to {{something}} I wish to tell you," [...] he said. [...] "The trouble is that it requires an explanation." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "'Say,' says Hicks, looking kind of funny, 'didn't anybody {{tell you}} fellows that the {{election}} was held a week before you came? Congress changed the date to July 27th. Roadrickeys was elected by 17,000. I thought you was booming old Rompiro for next term, two years from now. <b>Wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> was going to keep up such a hot lick that long.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father--father--sometimes I've <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{were ever}} {{coming back to}} me," [...] I heard the Story Girl say, as I turned and scuttled up the Walk, realizing that I was not wanted there just then and would be little missed. Various {{emotions}} and speculations possessed my mind in my retreat; but chiefly did I {{feel a sense of}} triumph in being the bearer of exciting news.|$|E
6000|$|... "She does, poor soul. I believe I'll go {{over and}} speak to her. I was {{introduced}} to her at Dave's but I haven't called." [...] Carol was slipping across the lawn, a white figure in the dimness, faintly brushing the dewy grass. She was thinking of Erik and {{of the fact that}} her feet were wet, and she was casual in her greeting: [...] "Hello! The doctor and I <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were lonely." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh." [...] The tacit wink was repeated. Mrs. Corey said brightly--much too brightly--"I {{was born}} in New York. I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> know the Dudenants?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yet it {{is a high}} part, and {{you play}} it very well. While I listened to you to-night, Zoola, twice and thrice I <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are not {{something}} more than you deem yourself to be. That beautiful body of yours is but a cup like those of other women, but say, who fills the cup with the wine of wisdom? Why do kings and councillors fear you, {{and why do you}} fear nothing? Why did dead Seyapi talk to me of you in dreams? What strange chance gave you that name of yours and made you holy in these men's eyes? What power teaches you the truth and gives you wit and strength to speak it? Why are you {{different from the rest of}} maidens, white or black?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All we {{want you}} to do," [...] put in Ray Cowles, [...] "is not to make a public {{spectacle}} of yourself--as I'm afraid you've been doing. Admire Frazer all you want to, and talk about him to your own bunch, and don't back down on your own opinions, only don't think you've got to go round yelling about him. People get a false idea of you. I hate to have to tell you this, but several of the fellows, even in Omega Chi, have spoken about you, and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> really were a regular crank. 'Of course he isn't, you poor cheese,' I tell 'em, but I can't be around to answer every one all the time, and you can't lick the whole college; that ain't the way the world does things. You don't know what a bad impression you make when you're too brash. See how I mean?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, I'll bet you haven't been idle. Just between us, as friends, Mr. Hodder, I've often <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> didn't {{work too}} hard--there's {{such a thing}} as being too conscientious, you know. And I've an idea {{that the rest of the}} vestry think so. Mr. Parr, for instance. We know when we've got a good thing, and we don't want to wear you out. Oh, we can {{appreciate}} your point of view, and admire it. But a little relaxation--eh? It's too bad that you couldn't have seen your way to take that cruise--Mr. Parr was all cut up about it. I guess you're the only man among all of us fairly close to him, who really knows him well," [...] said Mr. Plimpton, admiringly. [...] "He thinks a great deal of you, Mr. Hodder. By the way, have you seen him since he got back?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I shouldn't <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{got your}} gold-leaf for to-day's work. But who's your sunny Southern friend here?" [...] he added, {{following}} his companion's eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> and Mr Angel {{could manage}} a duet?" [...] said Lady Hammergallow to the Curate from Iping Hanger, {{who was looking}} preternaturally gloomy.|$|R
6000|$|... “The {{information}} I need {{is quite}} private,” he repeated. “You understand what I mean? I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{could give me}} a notion where he’s gone to?” ...|$|R
6000|$|Her {{laughter}} {{checked her}} reply a moment, {{and by the}} time she had recovered herself the young lady from Boston, with whom Vogelstein had been talking, stood there to take leave. This, for an American type, was an old one, he was sure; and the process of parting between the guest and her hostess had an ancient elaboration. Count Otto waited a little; then he turned away and walked up to Pandora Day, whose group of interlocutors had now been re-enforced by a gentleman who had held an important place in the cabinet of the late occupant of the presidential chair. He had asked Mrs. Bonnycastle if she were [...] "all alone"; but there was nothing in her present situation to show her for solitary. She wasn't sufficiently alone for our friend's taste; but he was impatient and he hoped she'd give him a few words to himself. She recognised him without a moment's hesitation and with the sweetest smile, a smile matching to a shade the tone in which she said: [...] "I was watching you. I <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> weren't going to speak to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|If Carol {{was writing}} {{a letter to a}} classmate, or {{planning}} the week's menus, she could be certain that Aunt Bessie would pop in and titter, [...] "Now don't let me disturb you, I just wanted to see where you were, don't stop, I'm not going to stay only a second. I just <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> could possibly have thought that I didn't eat the onions this noon because I didn't think they were properly cooked, but that wasn't the reason at all, it wasn't because I didn't think they were well cooked, I'm sure that everything in your house is always very dainty and nice, though I do think that Oscarina is careless about some things, she doesn't appreciate the big wages you pay her, and she is so cranky, all these Swedes are so cranky, I don't really see why you have a Swede, but----But that wasn't it, I didn't eat them not because I didn't think they weren't cooked proper, it was just--I find that onions don't agree with me, it's very strange, ever since I had an attack of biliousness one time, I have found that onions, either fried onions or raw ones, and Whittier does love raw onions with vinegar and sugar on them----" ...|$|E
5000|$|Because it was {{the last}} year of the plague, and the year of the great fire of London, which of course ended the plague by burning the slums down ... In this kind of game you’re always {{looking for a way to}} up the tension and frankly make the world a little more perilous, and justify why there aren’t giant crowds of people at the market. Then people had the idea for swarms of rats, and we were talking {{independently}} about possession, and we <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> should be able to possess rats and if they could clean up corpses so you don’t have to hide them. All these pieces just worked together.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't want to think--I don't care," [...] she replied. [...] "I {{only know}} that I love <b>you.</b> I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{will ever know}} how much!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{struck me}} some time ago," [...] he rejoined. [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can guess why I thought it worth while {{to put up}} with them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We don't want to {{play any}} tricks, Mr. Cole," [...] {{answered}} Jack. [...] "We are in trouble, and I was <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> could help us out." ...|$|R
