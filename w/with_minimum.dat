5|$|According to custom, pretenders to {{the throne}} had {{historically}} been put to death upon the naming of a new sovereign. Radama was opposed to this practice and asked the brothers to help ensure his accession {{to the throne}} <b>with</b> <b>minimum</b> bloodshed {{on the day of}} the queen's death. Rainilaiarivony successfully maintained authority over the palace guards anxiously awaiting the command from either faction to slaughter the other. When the queen's attendant quietly informed him that her final moments were approaching, Rainilaiarivony discreetly summoned Radama and Rainivoninahitriniony from the Prime Minister's palace to the royal Rova compound and ordered the prince crowned before the gathered soldiers, just as the queen was pronounced dead. Ramboasalama was promptly escorted to the palace where he was obliged to publicly swear allegiance to King Radama.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid is {{effective}} against all clinically important Gram-positive bacteria—those whose cell wall contains {{a thick layer}} of peptidoglycan and no outer membrane—notably Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant enterococci), Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, the viridans group streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, and Corynebacterium species (the latter being among the most susceptible to linezolid, <b>with</b> <b>minimum</b> inhibitory concentrations routinely below 0.5mg/L). Linezolid is also highly active in vitro against several mycobacteria. It appears to be very effective against Nocardia, but because of high cost and potentially serious adverse effects, authors have recommended that it be combined with other antibiotics or reserved for cases that have failed traditional treatment.|$|E

Mandela stated that they chose sabotage {{because it was the}} least harmful action, did not involve killing, and offered the best hope for racial reconciliation afterwards; he nevertheless acknowledged that should this have failed then guerrilla warfare might have been necessary. Soon after ANC leader Luthuli was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, MK publicly announced its existence with 57 bombings on Dingane's Day (16 December) 1961, followed by further attacks on New Year's Eve.|$|E

The owners countered by declaring a lockout. By July 14, 1968, the brief work stoppage came to an end.

5|$|Tau Ceti {{has been}} a target of a radial {{velocity}} planetary searches. As of 1988, observations ruled out any periodical variations attributable to massive planets around Tau Ceti inside of Jupiter-like distances. Ever-more precise measurements continue to rule out such planets, at least until December 2012. The velocity precision reached is about 11m/s measured over a five-year time span. This result excludes the presence of hot Jupiters, and probably excludes any planets <b>with</b> <b>minimum</b> mass {{greater than or equal}} to Jupiter's mass and with orbital periods less than 15 years. In addition, a survey of nearby stars by the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field and Planetary Camera was completed in 1999, including a search for faint companions to Tau Ceti; none were discovered to limits of the telescope's resolving power.|$|E
