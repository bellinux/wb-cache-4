25|$|The {{opposing}} argument {{posits that}} terraforming {{would be an}} unethical interference in nature, and that given humanity's past treatment of Earth, other planets may {{be better off without}} human interference. Still others strike a middle ground, such as Christopher McKay, who argues that terraforming is ethically sound only once we have completely assured that an alien planet does not harbor life of its own; but that if it does, we should not try to reshape it to our own use, but we should engineer its environment to artificially nurture the alien life and help it thrive and co-evolve, or even co-exist with humans. Even this would be seen as a type of terraforming to the strictest of ecocentrists, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that all life has the right, in its home biosphere, to evolve without outside interference.|$|E
500|$|The album's title {{supposedly}} {{comes from}} Cambridge slang for sex, commonly used by Pink Floyd friend and occasional roadie, Iain [...] "Emo" [...] Moore, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> [...] "I'm {{going back to}} the house for some ummagumma". According to Moore, he made up the term himself.|$|E
500|$|On 6 January 1969, the band's {{third day}} at Twickenham Film Studios, in {{south-west}} London, an argument was captured on film where McCartney criticised Harrison's guitar {{playing on the}} song [...] "Two of Us". A resigned Harrison told him: [...] "I'll play {{what you want me}} to play, or I won't play at all if you don't want me to play." [...] With the sessions being recorded by film director Michael Lindsay-Hogg, tapes reveal Beatles associates Neil Aspinall and George Martin sympathising with Harrison's position, recognising that McCartney and Lennon [...] "don't offer him enough freedom within their compositions". Ringo Starr, who had quit the band briefly during the White Album sessions, partly as a result of McCartney's hectoring of his drumming, recalled of Harrison's refusal to be [...] "dominated" [...] by McCartney any longer: [...] "Paul [...] wanted to point out the solo to George, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> 'Look, I'm a guitarist. I'll play the solo.' And he always did, he always played fine solos." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1957, O'Hara {{marked the}} end of a {{collaboration}} with John Ford with The Wings of Eagles, which was based on the true story of an old friend of Ford's, Frank [...] "Spig" [...] Wead, a naval aviator who became a screenwriter in Hollywood. Malone wrote that [...] "Wayne and O'Hara interact well in these early scenes, giving effortless performances and exhibiting a strong chemistry. One can sense the offscreen friendship in little nuances between them". Though not a major commercial success, it fared better {{in the eyes of the}} critics. The relationship between O'Hara and Ford grew increasingly bitter, and that year he referred to her as a [...] "greedy bitch" [...] to director Joseph McBride, who had shown an interest in casting her for The Rising of the Moon. O'Hara later referred to him as an [...] "instant conman" [...] <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> the opposite of what he felt said of his bitterness: [...] "He wanted to be born in Ireland and he wanted to be an Irish rebel. The fact that he wasn't left him very bitter".|$|E
500|$|The {{final two}} letters in Palmetto Leaves address the newly freed slaves in Florida. Two strong {{women who are}} less docile than Stowe is {{accustomed}} are included. One, a field hand turned domestic named Minnah, whom Stowe has {{tried in vain to}} teach how to do household chores, is so forthright in her speech that Stowe writes, [...] "Democracy never assumes a more rampant form than in some of these old negresses, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> their screed to the king on his throne if they died for it the next minute. Accordingly, Minnah's back was marked and scored with the tyrant's answers to free speech." [...] Minnah eventually returns happily to the fields. Another, Judy, is complacent and enjoys taking mornings and afternoons off to see to her husband. Stowe attributes their work ethic to poor training and [...] "the negligent habits inducted by slavery"; the truly talented and hard-working black laborers had moved on from homesteads to industry, able to demand their own price for their labors.|$|E
500|$|When {{development}} {{began in}} 2011, {{only a few}} core staff members {{were working on the}} game, forming a skeleton team. At this time, Yamazaki said that the player should be able to use emotions and analytical psychology to reach the truth, in addition to using evidence: he thought that previous Ace Attorney games had only focused on evidence versus statements, and wanted to introduce a third element. Natsuki Ikawa, one of the game designers, read books on psychology and talked to the other staff members about what to do. She wrote down several ideas for how to handle it, including goggles that show the witness's personality as a specter, or a large computer that analyzes brain waves and heart rates, and showed them to Yamazaki, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> [...] "that's a pretty nifty idea" [...] but still reject them; this contradiction between what he said and what he felt made Ikawa realize the basic concept for the mood matrix system, which was revised through feedback from everyone on the team and was implemented in the game. Another game designer, Yoriki Daigo, worked on several new features, including making the player able to move between locations freely and designing the revisualization system. Because the game was built from the ground up, the user interface for investigation sections was overhauled completely to be more visually appealing. The developers tried to keep the game simple, keeping it in line with Takumi's original vision of a game simple enough for his mother to play.|$|E

60|$|Men's minds {{were now}} {{beginning}} to cool--the character of the witnesses was more closely sifted--their testimonies did not in all cases tally--and a wholesome suspicion began to be entertained of men, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> never <b>say</b> they had made a full discovery of all they knew, but avowedly reserved some points of evidence to bear on future trials.|$|R

2500|$|Anytime the Angels win a game, {{the saying}} [...] "Light Up the Halo!", or [...] "Light That Baby Up!" [...] {{is used in}} {{reference}} to the giant landmark which is a big 230foot tall A with a halo surrounding the top which lights up every time the Angels win a game. Fans also use the saying, [...] "Just another Halo victory", as the late Angels broadcaster Rory Markas, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> the catch phrase after each win.|$|E
2500|$|When Muhammad died on 8 June 632 Umar {{initially}} disbelieved {{that he was}} dead. It is {{said that}} Umar promised to strike the head of any man <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that Muhammad died. Umar said: [...] He has not died but rather he has gone to his lord just as Moses went, remaining absent from his people for forty nights after which he has returned to them. By Allah, the messenger of Allah will indeed return just as Moses returned (to his people) and he will cut off the hands and legs of those men who claimed he has died.|$|E

50|$|There {{are some}} Chavacano {{speakers}} (especially older Caviteño or Zamboangueño speakers) <b>who</b> <b>would</b> tend to <b>say</b> 'mana' for 'maga'. 'Mana' is accepted and quite common, especially among older speakers, but when in doubt, the modifier 'maga' to pluralize nouns is safer to use.|$|R

2500|$|In 1986, {{plans to}} dig up the garden to build an {{underground}} parking garage led to protests in the media. The Los Angeles Times ran an editorial opposing the plan: [...] "There are times when the leaders of Los Angeles seem perversely intent on living up to the image that many outsiders have of them—insensitive and uncouth rabbits <b>who</b> <b>would,</b> <b>say,</b> dig up a garden {{to put in a}} parking lot." [...] The garden had also been threatened by an earlier proposal by the Los Angeles Raiders football team to convert the garden into a practice field for the team. In order to protect the garden from such threats, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1956, Powell {{attended}} a subcommittee on immigration control as a housing minister and advocated immigration controls. In August, {{he gave a}} speech {{at a meeting of}} the Institute of Personnel Management and was asked a question about immigration. He answered that limiting immigration would require a change in the law: [...] "There might be circumstances in which such a change of the law might be the lesser of two evils". But he added, [...] "There would be very few people <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> the time had yet come when it was essential that so great a change should be made". Powell later told Paul Foot that the statement was made [...] "out of loyalty to the Government line". Powell also spoke for the Rent Bill, which ended wartime rent controls when existing tenants moved out, thereby phasing out regulation.|$|E
2500|$|Mike {{is played}} by Harry Shum, Jr. He has also been portrayed as a very young boy by Evan Kishiyama in the episode [...] "The Substitute". When Shum was hired, he had been through the {{audition}} process, {{but as far as}} he knew [...] "it was just like a regular acting gig where you go on for a day." [...] In an interview with the New York Post, he elaborated, [...] "I got hired as a day player and it turned into a week, and then a month and so on. I was just rolling with it—I mean, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> no to that?" [...] Mike performed in the glee club's production numbers, but was given very little dialogue, staying mostly [...] "in the background, doing some facial expressions." [...] Shum noted, [...] "It wasn’t until I came on the [...] tour and had this crazy reaction from the audience, and the producers were like, 'Wow, how do they know him? Mike is a senior in the third season of the show. Glee co-creator Ryan Murphy has stated that, due to graduation, [...] "more characters are leaving than are staying" [...] {{at the end of the}} season. Mike's parents are dealing with his college plans and appear on the show in [...] "Asian F" [...] to this end, and may be recurring characters.|$|E
2500|$|Jack Kerouac later {{referred}} to 34 Beaulieu Street as [...] "sad Beaulieu". The Kerouac family was living there in 1926 when Jack's older brother Gerard died of rheumatic fever, aged nine. This deeply affected four-year-old Jack, <b>who</b> <b>would</b> later <b>say</b> that Gerard followed him in {{life as a}} guardian angel. This is the Gerard of Kerouac's novel Visions of Gerard. He had one other sibling, an older sister named Caroline. Kerouac was {{referred to}} as Ti Jean or little John around the house during his childhood.|$|R
5000|$|The Big Hello - David and Frank would {{announce}} {{that they were}} going to say a 'Big Hello' to someone (usually some relatively obscure person with a connection to football) <b>who</b> <b>would</b> then <b>say</b> 'hello' on a pre-recorded video clip. The whole studio would then reply with a very loud (big!) [...] "HELLO". After Germany were eliminated from Euro 2004, this was as a one-off changed to [...] "A big goodbye" [...] with the pre-recorded clip being the goal that knocked them out of the competition.|$|R
5000|$|Johnson {{was known}} to be a very well dressed and nice man <b>who</b> <b>would</b> rarely <b>say</b> no. He wore {{tailored}} suits, owned the entire ninth floor of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, and he owned a chauffeur-driven $14,000 1920 powder blue Rolls Royce Silver Ghost; which was his trademark car. It was known that when Nucky prospered, everyone prospered in his organization and the city. Johnson once explained, [...] "when I lived well, everybody lived well." [...] Johnson has been described as running his criminal-political empire with a [...] "velvet hammer".|$|R

5000|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} {{going to be}} titled God Save Sex Pistols. Jamie Reid's cover concept refrained from including {{a picture of the}} group and instead was dayglo red and yellow in colour with cutout lettering and a finish resembling crude screen-prints. The album's title changed in mid-1977, based on a phrase supplied by Steve Jones. Jones said he picked up the phrase [...] "Never mind the bollocks" [...] from two fans <b>who</b> <b>would</b> always <b>say</b> it to one another. Johnny Rotten explained its meaning as a working-class expression to [...] "stop talking rubbish".|$|R
60|$|There are {{no words}} {{to tell what}} the heart feels in reading the simple phrases of such a hero. Here is victory and courage, but love {{sublimer}} and superior. Here is a Christian soldier spending the night before battle in watching and preparing for the succeeding day, thinking of his dearest home, and sending many blessings forth to his Sarah, “lest he should never bless her more.” <b>Who</b> <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> Amen to his supplication? It was a benediction to his country—the prayer of that intrepid loving heart.|$|R

50|$|The {{amplitude}} of the movements is also undefined. Individual observers {{set their own}} frames of reference to judge amplitude (and possibly direction). Because the phenomenon is labile, {{it has been used}} to show the effects of social influence or suggestion on judgements. For example, if an observer <b>who</b> <b>would</b> otherwise <b>say</b> the light is moving one foot overhears another observer say the light is moving one yard, then the first observer will report that the light moved one yard. Discovery of the influence of suggestion on the autokinetic effect is often attributed to Sherif (1935), but it was recorded by Adams (1912), if not others.|$|R
