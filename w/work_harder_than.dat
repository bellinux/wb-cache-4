5|$|Luang Pu Sodh {{was born}} as Sodh Mikaewnoi on 10 October 1884 to a {{relatively}} well-off family of rice merchants in Amphoe Song Phi Nong, Suphan Buri, a province 102km west of Bangkok in central Thailand. His father was called Ngen and his mother Soodjai. He received part of his schooling in the temple of his uncle, a Buddhist monk, when he was nine years old. He therefore became familiar with Buddhism from an early age. He also showed qualities of being an intelligent autodidact. When Sodh's uncle moved to Wat Hua Bho, he took Sodh with him to teach him further. After a while his uncle left the monkhood, but Ngen managed to send Sodh to study with Luang Por Sub, the abbot of Wat Bangpla. This is where Sodh learnt the Khmer language. When he was thirteen years old, he finished his Khmer studies there and returned home to help his father. Father Ngen ran a rice-trading business, shipping rice from Suphanburi to sell to rice mills in Bangkok and Nakhon Chai Si District. At the age of fourteen, Ngen died, {{and he had to}} take responsibility for the family business, being the first son. This had an impact on him: thieves and other threats brought home to him the futility of the household life, and at the age of eighteen, he desired to be ordained as a monk. He had to take care of his family first though, and saved up money for them to be able to leave behind after he would become a monk. The biography of Wat Phra Dhammakaya says that he had to calculate the rate of inflation for this, and <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> before, but finally managed to gather enough funds after four years.|$|E

500|$|... "Two Black Cadillacs" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Billy Dukes of Taste of Country stated that [...] "vocally, Underwood is brilliant as always, and lyrically, she, Hillary Lindsey and Josh Kear have penned a tight story", but {{went on to}} say that [...] "compared to Underwood's other hits, this song doesn't stand out after one digests the macabre storyline. So, maybe it'll only sell a million singles and reach No. 2", giving the song three-and-a-half stars. Daryl Addison of Great American Country praised the song, saying that [...] "even with heavy thematic elements, the songs impressively maintain a pop/crossover shine and accessible sound, courtesy of Carrie's pristine voice and modern delivery." [...] Writing for Country Universe, Kevin Coyne gave the song an A, complimenting the singer's versatility, saying that [...] "it's a credit to her ambition as an artist. For someone so frequently accused of getting to the top without having to earn it, she continues to <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> the rest of her peers just to stay there." ...|$|E
500|$|Leandersson {{lives in}} Falun with her mother, stepfather, and two younger sisters. She is of Swedish and Iranian descent. Leandersson has always liked {{to dance and}} play theatre. Though there are several athletes in her family, she is not {{particularly}} fond of sports. [...] "I was on a football team when I was in third grade. But I {{was so bad that}} I wasn't allowed to play in a match", she recalled. She has stated on several occasions that she wants to continue acting, and has indicated that she would like to try different types of roles to challenge herself. Leandersson was a student at Gruvrisskolan. In an interview, she identified history as her favorite subject, because she finds it [...] "interesting to know how people lived and died in the past". She does not see school as a hindrance to continue acting, saying that she [...] "will just have to <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> everyone else. But school isn't that difficult, it's quite easy." [...] She is a fan of the Twilight film series. In 2011-2014 years she is studying theatre at [...] ,a school for performing arts in Stockholm, Sweden.|$|E

Am I an optimist? Maybe. What I'm not is cynical, or jaded, or tired. I don't owe favours to special interests or old friends or political cronies. Together, we can make Ontario {{the envy of the}} world, once again. And, I promise you this, no one will <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> I will to create that Ontario." ...|$|E

2500|$|De Sabata's {{conducting}} style {{combined the}} fiery temperament, iron control and technical precision of Toscanini with greater spontaneity {{and attention to}} orchestral color. He was exceptionally demanding of his players: according to one musician: [...] "Those eyes and ears missed nothing ... the players {{had been made to}} <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> ever before and they knew that, without having been asked to play alone, they had been individually assessed". On the podium he [...] "seemed to be dancing everything from a tarantella to a sabre dance". He suffered from a limp {{as a result of a}} childhood polio infection.|$|E
2500|$|A {{regiment}} is sent against [...] "Chonkin's gang", but Chonkin successfully fends {{them off}} until they use artillery. When general Drynov incredulously learns that Chonkin single-handedly (with his baba) was holding off the whole regiment, he declares Chonkin {{a hero and}} awards him an order taken off his own chest. When the NKVD lieutenant shows the order for Chonkin's arrest, Drynov shrugs and tells them {{to carry out their}} duty at which point Chonkin is arrested and carried off {{in the back of the}} truck to the [...] "Right Place", leaving Nyura on her knees on the road weeping after Chonkin as the scene closes and the book ends. The book ends with the joke on Gladyshev, whose misunderstanding of evolution (that monkeys became man through labor and intelligence) has been thoroughly dissettled by Chonkin's question why horses do not become men if they <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> men do, finds a note attached to the bottom of a hoof of his dead horse which had earlier disappeared. Supposing the horse had evolved and written the note, he is spooked and crosses himself.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Price {{sought the}} {{position}} of Republican Conference Chairman, which would have made him the fourth highest ranking Republican in the House. He was endorsed by Ryan, {{as well as by}} the Tea Party-affiliated organization FreedomWorks, conservative political commentator Erick Erickson, future Vice-President and then-governor of Indiana Mike Pence, and outgoing Republican Conference Chairman Jeb Hensarling. Ryan said of Price, [...] "He was instrumental in drafting our House Republican budget. His vocal leadership on issues like health care, tax reform, and fiscal matters has been vital to our messaging and policy efforts. No one will <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> Congressman Price at building a strong and compelling communications and policy strategy that reflects the will of our membership and the needs of the nation." [...] Although then-Speaker of the House John Boehner did not publicly endorse anyone in the race, he was seen as preferring Price's challenger for the position, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, and offered Price a separate position if he dropped out of the race for Conference Chairman - Price turned down the offer. He lost the election to McMorris Rodgers in November.|$|E

2500|$|Blue Horse {{was known}} for {{assisting}} white men in distress and swore {{in the presence of}} the Great Spirit [...] "Wakan Tanka" [...] that his brown hand had never risen to kill a white man. Blue Horse's friend E.A. Burbank reported: “At my hotel in Pine Ridge I chanced to meet a white Indian trader who owned a store about twenty-five miles from the agency. He said that a good many years before a band of Sioux had captured twelve of his comrades and planned to burn them at the stake. Blue Horse, who lived forty miles distant, heard of their intentions and immediately mounted his horse and rode as fast as he could to where the Indians held the whites captive. The trader said he never saw an Indian or a white man <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> Blue Horse did that day to save the lives of those twelve men, which he was able to accomplish, and from that time on, he said whenever he met Blue Horse he always gave him money and tobacco in recognition of his aid to white men in distress.” Blue Horse’s Wágluȟe village afterward became noted as a place of refuge for white travelers.|$|E
2500|$|McCreary saw {{his main}} {{theme for the}} series, which also {{represents}} the central team of agents, as primarily being a theme for Phil Coulson. McCreary noted that [...] "in one of the movies that would be inappropriate. You wouldn't do that for Coulson when Thor or Captain America {{are in the same}} story. But here Coulson is the hero ... It's all about him." [...] McCreary initially wrote the theme in F major, [...] "giving it a very triumphant sound", with one instance in the pilot diminishing it to F minor. Executive producer Jed Whedon [...] "astutely pointed out that the minor version was more satisfying than the major version", and so McCreary 'tweaked' the theme permanently into F minor. ABC and Marvel allowed McCreary to use a full symphonic orchestra for every episode, and so there is [...] "a full section of brass that's pounding out his theme when he comes out in his heroic moments." [...] McCreary had to <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> usual to make the theme heard, given that the show does not have a traditional title sequence. To accompany the main theme, McCreary wrote an ostinato [...] "that doesn’t draw as much attention to itself as a full-blown melody. I use this catchy little riff to build up steam before sweeping statements of the Main Theme." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{number of}} women who attend school in urban areas vs. rural areas differs drastically. [...] In urban areas, women's {{education}} is increasing every day. The parents of girls who live in urban areas are a lot more accepting of their enrolling in school and even encourage girls to pursue a career as they are also a lot more knowledgeable of their rights. This makes them a lot more motivated to stand up for their education. Parent in urban areas are a lot more modernized or westernized. These urban parents acknowledge the importance of an education. Women who live in urban areas are often enrolled in private schools getting a better education there as they have a lot more educational accessibility. Women in urban areas are also surrounded by people who are educated and are not put down or beaten for going to school. Unlike in urban areas, women in rural areas are discouraged to attend school. Most of them are brought up in conservative families with little to no education. They have to <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> women in urban areas because they have little support system. If their parents are accepting of education they still cannot go since most of them are very poor and cannot afford the expense. The women also don’t attend school in rural areas of Pakistan because it is not culturally accepted. These conservative families tend to be more traditional expecting women to stay at home and attend the house while men go out to work. They’re also restricted in rural areas because their town may not even have a school, therefore having to travel a long distance to attend one.|$|E
