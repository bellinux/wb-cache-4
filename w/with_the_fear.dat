Todd arrives and saves Batman, who subdues Scarecrow with his own fear toxin.|$|E
5|$|However, Bruce {{soon became}} embroiled in the {{disputes}} over Churchill's autocratic leadership style and {{his lack of}} consultation with the cabinet over war decisions. He was regularly left out of cabinet communique or not invited to meetings, much to his displeasure. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of Japanese invasion mounting in Australia throughout 1942, Bruce directly confronted Churchill {{on a number of}} occasions over Far East policy and the continuing lack of consultation with Australia and his own cabinet. Churchill usually responded by rebuffing him or pointedly excluding him further from government business. Although outwardly relenting in the face of pressure exerted by the dominions for representation in war decisions, Churchill routinely marginalised or ignored that representation. Bruce persisted in this difficult arrangement until May 1944 when he became completely disillusioned and resigned, choosing other forums in which to represent Australia in London. In spite of his tempestuous relationship with Churchill, Bruce was held in high regard by many cabinet members, particularly future prime ministers Clement Attlee and Anthony Eden, and his dogged determination to advance dominion interests during the war years earned him high praise from John Curtin and the other dominion prime ministers.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Rooster Teeth Productions created P.A.N.I.C.S. or PANICS, {{an acronym}} for People Acting Normal In Crazy-Ass Situations, is a comic science fiction series based on F.E.A.R.

Next, the Haganah defeated local militia in Tiberias. On 21–22 April in Haifa, after the Haganah waged a day-and-a-half battle including psychological warfare, the Jewish National Committee was unable to offer the Palestinian council assurance that an unconditional surrender would proceed without incident.

25|$|In late November 1191 the Crusader army {{advanced}} inland towards Jerusalem. In early December Saladin {{was under}} pressure from his emirs to disband {{the greater part of}} his army, which he reluctantly did on the twelfth of that month. Learning this, Richard pushed his army forward, spending Christmas at Latrun. The army then marched to Beit Nuba, only 12 miles from Jerusalem. Muslim morale in Jerusalem was so low that the arrival of the Crusaders would probably have caused the city to fall quickly. However, the weather was appallingly bad, cold with heavy rain and hailstorms. The poor weather, combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> that if it besieged Jerusalem the Crusader army might be trapped by a relieving force, caused the decision to retreat back to the coast to be made.|$|E
25|$|<b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of the {{consequences}} of increased labor and industrial unrest in early 1918, the Criminal Investigations Branch (CIB) was formed in the RNWMP in Regina. An overheated and reactionary federal government felt Canada was headed toward a Bolshevik-style revolution after the number of strikes dramatically increased. Prime Minister Robert Borden called a meeting with A. B. Perry, the commissioner of the RNWMP, in August 1919 to discuss the unworkable intelligence system in Canada and find a solution to it. Perry supplied a blueprint with several options days later. A decision was come upon and, in 1920, the RNWMP was dissolved {{to make way for the}} Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The RCMP's headquarters was to be set up in Ottawa, in order to make the agency national in scope. The RCMP would become the sole agency for security and intelligence matters in Canada.|$|E
25|$|Gender roles within social {{hierarchies}} {{are concerned}} with the question of agency in the conduct of physical violence. Men are expected to exert violence, while women are victimized by it. In conflict situations, rape against men dissolves this relationship and puts men in the ‘receiving’ role of the victim. Similarly, the ‘penetrating’ role of men as opposed to the ‘receiving’ role of women in (conventional) sexual intercourse illustrates this constructed power relationship. Hence, male rape victims experience the worst possible ‘humiliation’ with regards to the ingrained social roles they are traditionally expected to fulfill. Moreover, their stigmatization takes on particularly severe dimensions within conservative social environments in which homosexual intercourse – regardless of consent – is punished harshly. For example, Ugandan male rape victims explain their choice to not speak out <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of being branded homosexuals. As homosexuality is widely condemned in Uganda, male victims of sexual violence often struggle to get proper support because they are accused of being gay. In certain cases, gender roles concerning violence and sexual conduct are so deeply ingrained that the mere existence of male rape is denied.|$|E

25|$|Attachment theory postulates {{that the}} quality of caregiving an {{individual}} receives shapes many of the skills and motivations necessary for that individual to enact caregiving him- or herself. Indeed, research shows that personal attachment style (i.e., level of attachment security versus attachment avoidance or anxiety) is tightly linked to beliefs about, and strategies in, providing care to dependent others. Attachment avoidance, which is characterized by discomfort with intimacy, is related to less support giving and with keeping distance from a partner in need, particularly when the partner is experiencing higher levels of distress. When avoidant individuals do provide support, they tend to be more controlling. Attachment anxiety is related to controlling, overinvolved, intrusive, and compulsive caregiving (e.g., preoccupation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> that the partner will leave them if they do not provide adequate care). For example, anxiously attached individuals provide higher levels of support to partners who are about to engage in a stressful laboratory task, and this support is not matched to the level of need expressed by their partner. Anxiously attached individuals also display more negative support behaviours, such as blaming. Secure attachment is associated with more effective forms of caregiving (i.e., care that is responsive and not overinvolved).|$|E
25|$|As {{some of the}} {{refugees}} established homes in the area, the need for city services grew. This, combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> of annexation by San Francisco and being ignored by San Mateo County, whose seat far to the south left residents feeling ignored, created a demand for incorporation. The first such attempt was proposed in 1908 for incorporation as the city of Vista Grande. Vista Grande would have spanned from the Pacific to the Bay, with San Francisco as its northern border and South San Francisco and the old Rancho Buri Buri as its southern border. The proposal was rejected over {{the scope of the}} planned city, which was too broad for many residents. The initial proposal also revealed rifts in the community among the various regions, including the area around the cemeteries, who were excluded from further plans of incorporation. On January 16, 1911, an incorporation committee filed a petition with San Mateo County supervisors to incorporate the City of Daly City. The city would run from San Francisco along the San Bruno Hills until Price and School streets with San Francisco and west to the summit of the San Bruno Hills. The city would have an estimated population of 2,900. On March 18, 1911, a special election was held, with incorporation narrowly succeeding by a vote of 132 to 130.|$|E

This study utilized 20 female patients suffering from various specific phobias and ranging in age from 16 to 44. Patients were each provided with an individual therapy session in which Dr. Öst combined exposure therapy with modeling (where another person demonstrates how to interact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>feared</b> object) to reduce or completely cure the phobia. As each patient was gradually exposed to <b>the</b> <b>feared</b> stimulus, she was encouraged to approach and finally interact with it as her anxiety decreased, concluding <b>the</b> session when <b>fear</b> had been reduced by 50% or completely eliminated. Once the session was concluded, the patient was then to continue interaction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>feared</b> object on her own to reinforce what had been learned in the therapy session. Dr. Öst's results were collected over a seven-year period and concluded that [...] "90% of the patients were much improved or completely recovered after a mean of 2.1 hours of therapy".|$|R

Mack feels that Chloe has real abandonment issues, which play on the fact that she never feels like she is good enough for anyone. These abandonment issues were meant to provide a reason for why the character is devastated by the fact that Clark does not love her the same way that she loves him, as well as the reason for why Chloe does not have many female friends. One of Chloe's story arcs in season five involved her finding her mother in a mental institution, and living <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> that she will have a mental breakdown of her own and end up in a psychiatric facility.
