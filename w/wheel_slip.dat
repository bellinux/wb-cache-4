5|$|Released in September 2009, the E Series 2 HSV GTS {{incorporated}} {{a more powerful}} motor and drivetrain than other HSV models. It retains the same GM LS3 6.2L V8 engine but {{while the rest of}} the HSV range still have 317kW or 425bhp, the GTS engine is rated at (325kW). Twin bonnet scoops have returned to this model from the styling of the Pontiac G8. Other changes include the availability of launch control on manual versions, a recalibrated version of the magnetic ride control suspension with stiffer springs for the HSV GTS, wider wheels and a new high-flow dual-mode muffler system that produces a throatier roar under heavy acceleration. The E-Series 2 stability control system also has a Competition setting which allows for more <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> for special track or motorsport applications. The cruise control brakes the car when it is travelling downhill to ensure its speed stays within one per cent of the set speed. This model has daytime running lights.|$|E
25|$|On-Demand Mode - In {{this mode}} the {{transfer}} case operates {{primarily in the}} 2WD mode. Torque is transferred to the secondary axle as needed by modulating the transfer clutch from ‘open’ to a rigidly coupled state while avoiding any driveline wind-up. The torque modulation may be achieved by active electronic/hydraulic control systems, or by passive devices, based on <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> or wheel torque, {{as described in the}} section on traction control systems.|$|E
25|$|EMD {{introduced}} {{their new}} 710 engine in 1984 with the 60 Series locomotives (EMD SD60 and EMD GP60), the EMD 645 engine {{continued to be}} offered in certain models (such as the 50 Series) until 1988. The 710 is produced as an eight-, twelve-, sixteen-, and twenty-cylinder engine for locomotive, marine and stationary applications. Concurrently {{with the introduction of}} the 710, EMD's control systems on locomotives changed to microprocessors, with computer-controlled <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> prevention, among other systems.|$|E

30|$|From {{the above}} {{simulation}} results, {{it is found}} that when <b>wheels</b> <b>slip</b> on the rail and the friction coefficient between the wheel and rail is large enough, unstable vibration of the wheel–rail system will occur, signifying that rail corrugation will arise. Therefore, the effective method for controlling and suppressing rail corrugation in high-speed tracks is to prevent <b>wheels</b> <b>slipping</b> on rails. If the <b>wheel</b> does not <b>slip</b> on the rail, self-excited vibration of the wheel–rail system will not take place. Thus, rail corrugation will not occur. The present result explains why rail corrugation most probably takes place in train brake sections of tracks. This is because the wheel is easy to slip on the rail due to a low coefficient of friction when a train is braked at a high speed. This result {{can also be used to}} explain why most of rails in high-speed tracks are not subjected to corrugation, where <b>wheel</b> <b>slipping</b> on rail rarely takes place.|$|R
25|$|A unique {{feature of}} these units {{is that there}} is a {{variable}} traction control system in their computer systems. One of the differences between an ES44AC and an ES44C4 are the air cylinders and linkages on the truck sideframes of the ES44C4; these are part of the traction control system. Every time a variation in grade, traction, or <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> occurs, the computer will adjust the pressure in these cylinders to maintain sufficient adhesion, by varying the weight on the drive axles.|$|E
25|$|Pump: The pump in the ABS is used {{to restore}} the {{pressure}} to the hydraulic brakes after the valves have released it. A signal from the controller will release the valve at the detection of <b>wheel</b> <b>slip.</b> After a valve release the pressure supplied from the user, the pump {{is used to}} restore a desired amount of pressure to the braking system. The controller will modulate the pumps status {{in order to provide}} the desired amount of pressure and reduce slipping.|$|E
25|$|By 1 February 2007, 38 three-car {{sets were}} {{withdrawn}} due to continuing braking failures, meaning that {{almost half of}} the Siemens Nexas fleet (or around 10% of the total fleet) was out of revenue service. Amidst the media reporting an escalating problem with the risk of the entire fleet potentially having to be suspended, Siemens issued a statement on 31 January 2008 saying that they believed there had been no evidence during investigations of the braking failures that would require the entire fleet of trains to be withdrawn from service. Testing of affected trains was carried out on the Werribee line between Newport and Laverton, with soapy water sprayed onto the rails {{to increase the amount of}} <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> experienced, in an effort to replicate the brake fault. The entire fleet has now re-entered service, although with a restriction not to run single unit (3 car) operations.|$|E
50|$|Highsides {{differ from}} lowsides as follows: during a lowside the rear <b>wheel</b> <b>slips</b> {{laterally}} and continuously until the bike falls onto its side (the side that's inside the corner), while during a highside the rear <b>wheel</b> <b>slips</b> laterally only briefly before suddenly regaining traction and flipping the bike onto its other side (the side that's outside the corner, {{and therefore the}} higher side of the motorbike). As a result, highsides happen very quickly with little, if any, warning and are very violent.|$|R
5000|$|Train noise on curves {{is caused}} by the <b>wheels</b> <b>slipping</b> along the rails. This {{slippage}} also causes noise and surface damage called corrugation. The process by which the noise and corrugation occur is: ...|$|R
60|$|A whir of driver <b>wheels</b> <b>slipping</b> on {{the rails}} {{came down the}} track, {{followed}} by a shock of couplings tightening and the snorting of a heavy locomotive, {{but none of the}} party noticed it.|$|R
25|$|The {{described}} system handles extremely well, {{as it is}} able {{to accommodate}} various forces of movement and distribute power evenly and smoothly, making slippage unlikely. Once it does slip, however, recovery is difficult. If the left front wheel of a 4WD vehicle slips on an icy patch of road, for instance, the slipping wheel will spin faster than the other wheels due to the lower traction at that wheel. Since a differential applies equal torque to each half-shaft, power is reduced at the other wheels, even if they have good traction. This problem can happen in both 2WD and 4WD vehicles, whenever a driven wheel is placed on a surface with little traction or raised off the ground. The simplistic design works acceptably well for 2WD vehicles. It is much less acceptable for 4WD vehicles, because 4WD vehicles have twice as many wheels with which to lose traction, increasing the likelihood that it may happen. 4WD vehicles may also be more likely to drive on surfaces with reduced traction. However, since torque is divided amongst four wheels rather than two, each wheel receives approximately half the torque of a 2WD vehicle, reducing the potential for <b>wheel</b> <b>slip.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A fairly recent {{innovation}} in automobiles is electronic traction control. Traction control typically uses a vehicle's braking system to slow a spinning wheel. This forced slowing emulates {{the function of}} a limited-slip differential, and, by using the brakes more aggressively to ensure wheels are being driven at the same speed, can also emulate a locking differential. It {{should be noted that}} this technique normally requires wheel sensors to detect when a wheel is slipping, and only activates when <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> is detected. Therefore, there is typically no mechanism to actively prevent <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> (i.e., you can't [...] "lock the differential" [...] in advance of <b>wheel</b> <b>slip),</b> rather the system is designed to expressly permit <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> to occur, and then attempt to send torque to the wheels with the best traction. If preventing all-wheel slip is a requirement, this is a limiting design.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{commonly}} believed [...] these units were fitted with higher-capacity AR16 alternators, traction motors, possibly increased engine power, and Super Series <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> control; however, Don Strack's research in Union Pacific's archives has proven that the UP units at least {{were not so}} equipped.|$|E
40|$|Skid-steered mobile robots {{have been}} {{developed}} to explore unknown environments, especially in rough terrain situations, where the <b>wheel</b> <b>slips</b> always occur and vary when the robot is traveling with different trajectory shapes. The wheel slippage limits the traction and braking abilities of the robot. In this paper, we propose a new dual estimation algorithm to overcome the previous limitations. The estimated values such as the robot's positions and <b>wheel</b> <b>slips</b> are obtained based on the Kalman filtering technique. As demonstrated by our experimental results, the advantages of the new method are effective to overcome the slip limitations in the path tracking control problem of a four-track wheel skid-steered mobile robot (4 -TW SSMR) ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{earliest}} locomotives {{in revenue}} service were small four-wheeled ones {{similar to the}} Rocket. However, the inclined cylinders caused the engine to rock, so they first became horizontal and then, in his [...] "Planet" [...] design, were mounted inside the frames. While this improved stability, the [...] "crank axles" [...] were extremely prone to breakage. Greater speed was achieved by larger driving wheels at expense of a tendency for <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> when starting. Greater tractive effort was obtained by smaller wheels coupled together, but speed was limited by {{the fragility of the}} cast iron connecting rods.

2500|$|The {{development}} of the 16-cylinder EMD 50 and 60 series locomotives in the late 1970s and early 1980s was spurred {{by the introduction of}} [...] 16-cylinder GE B36-7 (B-B) and GE C36-7 (C-C) locomotives by EMD's main competitor General Electric. EMD previously manufactured the [...] 20-cylinder SD45 and SD45-2 locomotives, but they had a reputation for high fuel consumption. [...] In 1980, the SD50 model was added to the EMD Catalog. [...] However, the SD50's electrical reliability was poor and, similarly, the [...] 16-645F engine had poor mechanical reliability, both believed to be largely due to excessive vibration from the 950 maximum rpm of the 645F prime mover. It was time to develop a replacement for the venerable 645 engine which, in its earlier 16-645E form, had proved to be exceptionally reliable. [...] EMD therefore quickly commenced {{development of}} the SD60 series, which would eliminate the weaknesses of the SD50. The lessons learned in developing the 645F crankcase and crankshaft (for the earlier 20-645E, and the then-current 16-645F) were incorporated in the replacement, the 710G, first employed in the SD60. [...] Although the carbody and frame are nearly indistinguishable from the earlier SD50, the SD60 featured the new 16-cylinder EMD 710G3A prime mover, AR-11 traction alternator, D-87 traction motors and a microprocessor-based control system that governed various electrical systems within the locomotive (e.g., <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> and transition).|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, Mitsubishi {{released}} the Diamante (Sigma) in Japan. It featured a new electronically controlled active trace & {{traction control system}} (the first integration of these two systems in the world) that Mitsubishi developed (see Mitsubishi AWC). Simply named TCL in 1990, the system has now evolved into Mitsubishi's modern Active Skid and Traction Control (ASTC) system. Developed to help the driver maintain the intended line through a corner; an onboard computer monitored several vehicle operating parameters through various sensors. When too much throttle has been used when taking a curve, engine output and braking are automatically regulated to ensure the proper line through a curve and to provide the proper amount of traction under various road surface conditions. While conventional traction control systems at the time featured only a slip control function, Mitsubishi's newly developed TCL system had a preventive (active) safety function which improved the course tracing performance by automatically adjusting the traction force (called [...] "trace control") thereby restraining the development of excessive lateral acceleration while turning. Although not a ‘proper’ modern stability control system, trace control monitors steering angle, throttle position and individual wheel speeds {{although there is no}} yaw input. The TCL system's standard <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> control function enables better traction on slippery surfaces or during cornering. In addition to the TCL system's individual effect, it also works together with Diamante's electronic controlled suspension and four-wheel steering that Mitsubishi had equipped to improve total handling and performance.|$|E

Values less than zero, in which the front wheel must be turned opposite the direction of the curve due to much greater rear <b>wheel</b> side <b>slip</b> than front <b>wheel</b> have been described as counter-steering.

50|$|A {{weakness}} of systems {{that rely on}} wheel rotation for tachometry and odometry is that the train wheels and the rails are very smooth and the friction between them is low, leading to high error rates if the <b>wheels</b> <b>slip</b> or slide. To compensate for this, secondary odometry inputs employ Doppler radar units beneath the train to measure speed independently.|$|R

The currents would differ during <b>wheel</b> <b>slip,</b> producing a resultant flux that acted as the Control winding, developing a voltage across a resistor in series with the AC winding which was sent to the <b>wheel</b> <b>slip</b> correction circuits.|$|E
