5|$|A {{number of}} {{programme}} evaluations {{have found that}} many resettled refugees have been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in the UK. The Home Office's 2009 evaluation notes that between one-quarter and half of each of four groups of Liberian and Congolese refugees resettled under the programme had suffered verbal or physical harassment. An evaluation undertaken by academics at Sheffield Hallam University for the Home Office in 2011 found that one-fifth of the refugees surveyed for the evaluation (who {{had been in the}} UK for a year) had been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in their first six months in the UK, and just over a fifth had been attacked in the second six months of their resettlement. Many of the victims of this abuse had not reported it to the authorities, and the authors of the evaluation suggest that this is a reason <b>why</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a gap between the perceptions of refugee and service providers, who generally suggested that community relations were good. Verbal and physical attacks against refugees were also noted in the 2013 Motherwell evaluation.|$|E

Fiero blueprints traveled {{back and forth between}} the two engineering branches, using up time and money. Aldikacti was forced to sit the two teams of engineers down next to one another, allowing for no excuses to <b>why</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> “no build” after his design was done. Many modifications in the Fiero’s production needed to be made; for instance, despite his long-standing interest in manufacturing body panels from plastic, Aldikacti consented to metal body pieces, the dies for which were much less costly.|$|E
25|$|In 1948 the Tour of Flanders was {{included}} in the first running of the Challenge Desgrange-Colombo, cycling's first international season-long competition, which had spurred its status as an international event. Until the Second World War, the Tour of Flanders had been held on the same day as Milan–San Remo, Italy's biggest cycling classic. Prominent Italian and French riders preferred the latter which explains <b>why</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> only a single non-Belgian winner before the war. The organisers changed the date {{to meet the needs of}} the Challenge Desgrange-Colombo. The 1948 edition featured a record 265 participants, of which 50 non-Belgians, the largest peloton ever to take the start. Briek Schotte won his second Ronde.|$|E
25|$|VIDA: Women in Literary Arts was co-founded in 2009 by poets Erin Belieu and Cate Marvin. Belieu and Marvin, {{because they}} are both poets and teachers, had been acquainted with one another for some time. However, due to there being {{a small amount of}} {{opportunities}} for women in the literary community, they perceived themselves as being in competition with one another. That perception changed when Marvin sent Belieu an email detailing how isolated she felt as a female writer, and questioning <b>why</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no feminist conversation happening in literary circles. Belieu then forwarded the email to hundreds of writers, and it received a huge response. Based on that response, Belieu and Marvin decided to co-found VIDA: Women in Literary Arts.|$|E

25|$|Although {{there were}} only a handful of {{consistent}} superstring theories, it remained a mystery <b>why</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> not just one consistent formulation. However, as physicists began to examine string theory more closely, they realized that these theories are related in intricate and nontrivial ways. They found that a system of strongly interacting strings can, in some cases, be viewed as a system of weakly interacting strings. This phenomenon is known as S-duality. It was studied by Ashoke Sen in the context of heterotic strings in four dimensions and by Chris Hull and Paul Townsend {{in the context of the}} type IIB theory. Theorists also found that different string theories may be related by T-duality. This duality implies that strings propagating on completely different spacetime geometries may be physically equivalent.|$|E

500|$|The book {{is divided}} into six chapters: It begins with author Alina Simone walking around Bay City, Michigan and pondering <b>why</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> not a single {{commemoration}} {{to be found in}} the city about Madonna, who was born there. Simone's research began from that point and the essay continues analyzing Bay City and its culture. In the next chapter the author moves on to talk about 1980s music, Madonna's contribution and popularity after the release of albums, Like a Virgin (1984) and True Blue (1986). One of the questions reiterated by Simone is about the singer's legacy and what would happen to her wealth and fortune after her death, seeing that Madonna was not receiving the respect she deserved. With this in mind, Simone talks about how pop culture has moved from one fad to another, and her analysis of the musical landscape in Bay City. In the last chapter titled as Flying Wedge, the author reviews hard rock music and the punk rock bands of the city, and finally how relentless artists can be to produce music. She researches the one-hit wonder bands like Question Mark and the Mysterians—best known for [...] "96 Tears"—and Flying Wedge, a Detroit band that released their record through Creem magazine in 1972 but disappeared. The author ends the book on a happy note that whether Madonna is remembered or not in her hometown, her musical outputs would never be forgotten. Final chapters are devoted to an epilogue about Simone's writing of the book and a thank-you section.|$|E

The definition of countability requires that a certain one-to-one correspondence, which is itself a set, must exist.
