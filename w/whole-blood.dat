25|$|A blood {{donation}} {{occurs when a}} person voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions and/or made into biopharmaceutical medications by a process called fractionation (separation of <b>whole-blood</b> components).

25|$|Like {{many other}} organic acidemias, GA1 causes {{carnitine}} depletion. <b>Whole-blood</b> carnitine {{can be raised}} by oral supplementation. However, this does not significantly change blood concentrations of glutarylcarnitine or esterified carnitine, suggesting that oral supplementation is suboptimal in raising tissue levels of carnitine.

25|$|Platelets do {{not need}} to belong to the same A-B-O blood group as the {{recipient}} or be cross-matched to ensure immune compatibility between donor and recipient unless they contain a significant amount of red blood cells (RBCs). The presence of RBCs imparts a reddish-orange color to the product, and is usually associated with <b>whole-blood</b> platelets. An effort is sometimes made to issue type specific platelets, but this is not critical as it is with RBCs.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis of {{elemental}} or inorganic mercury poisoning involves {{determining the}} history of exposure, physical findings, and an elevated body burden of mercury. Although <b>whole-blood</b> mercury concentrations are typically less than 6μg/L, diets rich in fish can result in blood mercury concentrations higher than 200μg/L; {{it is not that}} useful to measure these levels for suspected cases of elemental or inorganic poisoning because of mercury's short half-life in the blood. If the exposure is chronic, urine levels can be obtained; 24-hour collections are more reliable than spot collections. It is difficult or impossible to interpret urine samples of patients undergoing chelation therapy, as the therapy itself increases mercury levels in the samples.|$|E
25|$|Pooled <b>whole-blood</b> platelets, {{sometimes}} called “random” platelets, {{are separated by}} one of two methods. In the US, a unit of whole blood is placed into a large centrifuge in what {{is referred to as}} a “soft spin.” At these settings, the platelets remain suspended in the plasma. The platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is removed from the red cells, then centrifuged at a faster setting to harvest the platelets from the plasma. In other regions of the world, the unit of whole blood is centrifuged using settings that cause the platelets to become suspended in the “buffy coat” layer, which includes the platelets and the white blood cells. The “buffy coat” is isolated in a sterile bag, suspended in a small amount of red blood cells and plasma, then centrifuged again to separate the platelets and plasma from the red and white blood cells. Regardless of the initial method of preparation, multiple donations may be combined into one container using a sterile connection device to manufacture a single product with the desired therapeutic dose.|$|E
25|$|Apheresis {{platelets}} {{are collected}} using a mechanical device that draws {{blood from the}} donor and centrifuges the collected blood to separate out the platelets and other components to be collected. The remaining blood is returned to the donor. The advantage to this method is that a single donation provides at least one therapeutic dose, {{as opposed to the}} multiple donations for <b>whole-blood</b> platelets. This means that a recipient is not exposed to as many different donors and has less risk of transfusion-transmitted disease and other complications. Sometimes a person such as a cancer patient who requires routine transfusions of platelets will receive repeated donations from a specific donor to further minimize the risk. Pathogen reduction of platelets using for example, riboflavin and UV light treatments can also be carried out to reduce the infectious load of pathogens contained in donated blood products, thereby reducing the risk of transmission of transfusion transmitted diseases. Another photochemical treatment process utilizing amotosalen and UVA light has been developed for the inactivation of viruses, bacteria, parasites, and leukocytes that can contaminate blood components intended for transfusion. In addition, apheresis platelets tend to contain fewer contaminating red blood cells because the collection method is more efficient than “soft spin” centrifugation at isolating the desired blood component.|$|E
6000|$|Beyond the Rábigh, we ascended {{a lateral}} valley, whence a low divide {{led to the}} Wady el-Bahrah ("of the Basin"), another feeder of the Sirr.

Then began a short {{up-slope}} with a longer counterslope, on which we met a party of Huwaytát, camel-men and foot-men going to buy grain at El-Wigh. Another apparition was a spear-man bestriding a bare-backed colt; after reconnoitering us for some time, he yielded to the temptations of curiosity. It afterwards struck us that, mounted on our mules, preceded and followed by the Shaykhs riding their dromedaries, we must have looked mighty like a party of prisoners being marched inland. The horseman was followed by a rough-coated, bear-eared hound of the kind described by Wellsted[EN#63] as [...] "resembling the English mastiff"--he did not know how common is the beast further north. The Kalb gasúr (jasur) or [...] "bold dog," [...] also called Kalb el-hámi, or [...] "the hot" [...] (tempered), is found even amongst the Bedawin to the east of the Suez Canal; but there the half-bred is more common than the <b>whole-blood.</b> It is trained to tend the flocks; it never barks, nor bites its charges; and it is said to work as well as the shepherd-dog of Europe.|$|E

50|$|Glucose is {{measured}} in whole blood, plasma or serum. Historically, blood glucose values were given in terms of whole blood, but most laboratories now measure and report plasma or serum glucose levels. Because red blood cells (erythrocytes) have a higher concentration of protein (e.g., hemoglobin) than serum, serum has a higher water content and consequently more dissolved glucose than does whole blood. To convert from <b>whole-blood</b> glucose, multiplication by 1.15 {{has been shown to}} generally give the serum/plasma level.|$|E

They continued using immobilized enzyme techniques, for the first direct <b>whole-blood</b> L-lactate assays using immobilized enzyme electrode also in 1982[...] They also continued developing thermal technology, with the first commercial gallium melting-point temperature standard (29.7715 °C) in 1977 and the first robotic-manufactured glass-encapsulated precision thermistors in 1996.|$|E
50|$|Secondly, one is {{generally}} allowed to donate platelets anywhere from every 3-28 days. This is {{a stark contrast}} to <b>whole-blood</b> donation, which has an eight-week (or longer) waiting period between donations. Along those lines, since platelet donation does temporarily remove whole blood from the body, {{it may be necessary to}} wait eight weeks after a whole blood donation to donate platelets, although two weeks is more common. In the US, a donor is only allowed to donate 24 times each year and may not lose more red blood cells or plasma in a year than they would from the maximum allowable number of whole blood donations.|$|E
5000|$|Not all {{platelet}} transfusions use platelets {{collected by}} automated apheresis. The platelets {{can also be}} separated from donations of whole blood collected in a traditional blood donation, but there are several advantages to separating the platelets {{at the time of}} collection. The first advantage is that the <b>whole-blood</b> platelets, sometimes called [...] "random" [...] platelets, from a single donation are not numerous enough for a dose to give to an adult patient. They must be pooled from several donors to create a single transfusion, and this complicates processing and increases the risk of diseases that can be spread in transfused blood, such as human immunodeficiency virus.|$|E
50|$|Fibrinogen level can be {{measured}} in venous blood. Normal levels are about 1.5-3 g/L, depending on the method used. In typical circumstances, fibrinogen is measured in citrated plasma samples in the laboratory; however, the analysis of <b>whole-blood</b> samples by use of thromboelastometry (platelet function is inhibited with cytochalasin D) is also possible. Higher levels are, amongst others, associated with cardiovascular disease (>3.43 g/L). It may be elevated in any form of inflammation, as it is an acute-phase protein; for example, it is especially apparent in human gingival tissue during the initial phase of periodontal disease. Fibrinogen levels increase in pregnancy to an average of 4.5 g/l, compared to an average of 3 g/l in non-pregnant people.|$|E

50|$|Wildlife {{biomonitoring}} {{studies have}} found {{the highest level of}} PFOSA in the liver of common dolphin (Mediterranean Sea, Italy) with a concentration of 878 parts per billion; the liver of mink from Illinois, US contained 590 parts per billion. In fish, the highest levels detected were in the liver of Norway Pike (91 parts per billion) and homogenates of slimy sculpin (150 parts per billion) from Lake Ontario. Differences in biotransformation across species could explain some of its presence. In humans, PFOSA has been detected in sub- to low-parts per billion levels; for example, in 1999-2000 US serum samples, the 95th percentile (or value where only 5% of the population was higher) was 1.4 parts per billion while in 2003-2004 the 95th percentile fell to 0.2 parts per billion.
