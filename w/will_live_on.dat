5|$|In the sonnet, {{the speaker}} asks {{whether or not}} he should compare his beloved to the summer season, and argues that he should not because the {{comparison}} does not properly express the depths of his emotion. He also states that his beloved <b>will</b> <b>live</b> <b>on</b> forever through the words of the poem. Scholars have found parallels within the poem to Ovid's Tristia and Amores, both of which have love themes. Sonnet 18 is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, having 14 lines of iambic pentameter ending in a rhymed couplet. Detailed exegeses have revealed several double meanings within the poem, giving it a greater depth of interpretation.|$|E
5|$|Ryu fights back to {{the inner}} {{chambers}} of the Ancient Ship of Doom, where he prepares {{to engage in the}} final showdown against Clancy, who has now transmuted into a super bio-noid. Clancy offers Ryu to have him and Irene work for him by his side wipe out the human race and usher a new age, but Ryu refuses and commences with the final battle. After transforming twice into progressively-stronger versions of himself, Clancy is defeated by Ryu, and Ryu is transported outside the warship and back to Irene; they both watch as the Ancient Ship of Doom is brought down and explodes, and they witness the crumbling of Castle Rock fortress. In the aftermath, Ryu tells Irene that Clancy's and Foster's plan have been foiled, and that mankind <b>will</b> <b>live</b> <b>on</b> and refuse to be part of anyone's evil plans; he adds that mankind would never stoop to a level in which they would completely destroy themselves out of mere ambition. The two watch as the sun rises and as a new day begins.|$|E

25|$|A healthy fancy mouse <b>will</b> <b>live</b> <b>on</b> average 18 to 30 months, {{depending}} on genetic predisposition. Like most mammals mice {{are susceptible to}} mites, ticks and other skin parasites, as well as intestinal parasites. The cage should be cleaned regularly, and preferably treated with anti-mite spray. Mice are particularly sensitive to drafts and may pick up colds and other flu-like conditions. Mice can also over-groom when stressed, leading to skin irritations and fur loss. Older mice are susceptible to tumors, especially breast cancer in females as the mammary tissue is distributed around much of the body. Persistent problems should be referred to a veterinarian, although finding a veterinarian with experience in treating mice can be difficult.|$|E

25|$|The partial state {{government}} shutdown of July 2005 was an unprecedented fiasco which <b>will</b> <b>live</b> <b>on</b> {{in the minds}} of MAPE members and other state employees who were sent home for eight days that summer with no knowledge of when they would be allowed to return to work. The governor and legislature failed to pass a state budget by the constitutional deadline of midnight on June 30, 2005 and therefore had no authority to pay thousands of the state’s employees for work performed. The politicians further attempted to divide state employees by deeming some “essential,” and sending the rest home. The “make half” settlement allowed those workers sent home, through no fault of their own to receive half of the pay or vacation hours lost ten months after the fact.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Black Knight is Sir Percy of Scandia, a 6th-century knight {{who serves}} {{at the court}} of King Arthur as his greatest warrior. Recruited by the wizard Merlin, Percy adopts a double identity, and pretends to be totally incompetent until changing into the persona of the Black Knight. As the Black Knight, Percy wields the Ebony Blade, which Merlin forged from a meteorite. A constant foe of the evil knight Mordred the Evil (Arthur's traitorous nephew), Percy is eventually killed by him during the fall of Camelot when stabbed from behind with an enchanted blade – although Mordred then dies himself of wounds inflicted by Arthur. Merlin ensures that Percy's spirit <b>will</b> <b>live</b> <b>on</b> by casting a spell that will revive his ghost if Mordred should ever return. Percy's spirit has appeared several times to counsel his descendant, Dane Whitman.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the guests}} at the party are Totsky, General Yepanchin, Ganya, his friend Ptitsyn (Varya's husband), and Ferdyshchenko, who, with Nastassya Filippovna's approval, {{plays the role of}} cynical buffoon. With the {{acquiescence}} of Kolya, Prince Myshkin arrives, uninvited. To enliven the party, Ferdyshchenko suggests a game where everyone must recount the story of the worst thing they have ever done. Others are shocked at the proposal, but Nastassya Filippovna is enthusiastic. When it comes to Totsky's turn he tells a long but completely innocuous anecdote from the distant past. Disgusted and angry, Nastassya Filippovna turns to Myshkin and demands his advice on whether or not to marry Ganya. Myshkin advises her not to, and Nastassya Filippovna, to the dismay of Totsky, General Yepanchin and Ganya, firmly announces that she is following this advice. At this point, Rogozhin and his followers arrive with the promised 100,000 rubles. Nastassya Filippovna is preparing to leave with him, exploiting the scandalous scene to humiliate Totsky, when Myshkin himself offers to marry her. He speaks gently and sincerely, and in response to incredulous queries about what they <b>will</b> <b>live</b> <b>on,</b> produces a document indicating that he will soon be receiving a large inheritance. Though surprised and deeply touched, Nastassya Filippovna, after throwing the 100,000 rubles in the fire and telling Ganya they are his if he wants to get them out, chooses to leave with Rogozhin. Myshkin follows them.|$|E

500|$|The poem {{starts with}} a {{flattering}} question to the beloved—"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?" [...] The beloved is [...] "more lovely and more temperate" [...] than a summer's day. The speaker lists some negative things about summer: it is short—"summer's lease hath all too short a date"—and sometimes the sun is too hot—"Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines." [...] However, the beloved has beauty that will last forever, unlike the fleeting beauty of a summer's day. By putting his love's beauty into the form of poetry, the poet is preserving it forever. [...] "So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see, So long lives this, and this gives life to thee." [...] The lover's beauty <b>will</b> <b>live</b> <b>on,</b> through the poem which will {{last as long as}} it can be read.|$|E

[...] Dave Golder from SFX thought that although the series was [...] "shaping up to be like no other before it, as the show moves even further away from its traditional series of sequential standalone stories format and more towards Lost style storytelling", that the episode [...] "is no mere exercise in delayed gratification. You want fun? You want creepy? You want action? You've got it– all not-so-neatly tied up with a neat bow tie." [...] Golder went on to state that [...] "once again we're treated to some outstanding direction, glorious performances, near flawless FX and gorgeous locations ... "Day Of The Moon" [...] is huge fun, effortlessly entertaining, beguilingly bat's-arse [...] and blessed with a cliffhanger so jawdroppingly unexpected it's bound to keep viewers hooked". He gave the episode a rating of four out of five stars.|$|E
500|$|After {{the series}} finale, the Los Angeles Times {{characterized}} the series as [...] "an epic poem, with Jack Bauer {{in the role}} of Odysseus or Beowulf. Which means he needed to be fighting monsters, not essentially decent people who have made one very bad decision." [...] The critic {{went on to say that}} villain Charles Logan encapsulated all that [...] "Jack and 24 fought against for so long: political corruption and cowardice, narcissism and megalomania, ruthlessness and stupidity." [...] One reviewer for BuddyTV said that [...] "I'll remember the legacy of 24 as an action drama that redefined what serialized television can do and provided many shocking twists and turns along the way—the biggest one being the very real impact the show had on American foreign policy." [...] The New York Times said [...] "24 <b>will</b> <b>live</b> <b>on,</b> possibly as a feature film, and surely in classrooms and in textbooks. The series enlivened the country's political discourse in a way few others have, partly because it brought to life the ticking time-bomb threat that haunted the Cheney faction of the American government in the years after 9/11." [...] The show was declared the sixth highest rated show for the first ten years of IMDb.com Pro (2002–2012).|$|E

Baradwaj Rangan of The Hindu said, [...] "My interest in Karnan (apart from the critic's mandate that I see everything) was primarily the songs", and noted that Sirkazhi Govindarajan's [...] "liquid diction and brass-throated conviction makes today's male singers sound like tentative little boys in a parent's day recital". Meera Srinivasan, another critic from The Hindu praised the film for the [...] "music score and songs by the inimitable Viswanathan-Ramamoorthy duo with Kannadasan's striking lyrics". Malathi Rangarajan said, [...] "The illustrious composing duo of Viswanathan and Ramamurthy has worked magic with music". M. Suganth of The Times of India stated [...] "The songs are one too many (but what songs they are!)". K. N. Vijayan of The New Straits Times said, [...] "Instead of trooping out, the audience sat through the 14 songs composed by the Viswanathan-Ramamoorty pair. They are that famous and many can sing along to the lyrics as the songs have been heard countless times on the radio". Writing for The Hindu, C. V. Vasudevan wrote that Karnan [...] "stood out for its brilliant orchestration by Viswanathan-Ramamoorthy and Kannadasan’s lyrical beauty." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's {{theme of}} class has {{attracted}} much scholarly attention. Carole Dole noted that class constitutes {{an important element}} in Austen's stories and is [...] "impossible" [...] to avoid when adapting her novels. According to Dole, Lee's film contains an [...] "ambiguous treatment of class values" [...] that stresses social differences but [...] "underplays the consequences of the class distinctions so important in the novel"; for instance, Edward's story ends upon his proposal to Elinor, with no attention paid to how they <b>will</b> <b>live</b> <b>on</b> his small annual income from the vicarage. Louise Flavin believed that Lee used the houses to represent their occupants' class and character: the Dashwood sisters' decline in eligibility are represented through the contrast between the spacious rooms of Norland Park and those of the isolated, cramped Barton Cottage. James Thompson criticised what he described as the anaesthetised [...] "mélange of disconnected picture postcard-gift-calendar-perfect scenes," [...] in which little connection is made between [...] "individual subjects and the land that supports them." [...] Andrew Higson argued that while Sense and Sensibility includes commentary on sex and gender, it fails to pursue issues of class. Thompson's script, he wrote, displays a [...] "sense of impoverishment [...] confined to the still privileged lifestyle of the disinherited Dashwoods. The broader class system is pretty much taken for granted." [...] The ending visual image of flying gold coins, depicted during Marianne's wedding, has also drawn attention; Marsha McCreadie noted that it serves as a [...] "visual wrap-up and emblem of the merger between money and marriage." ...|$|E
