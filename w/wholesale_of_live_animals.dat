40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to analyse the {{transport}} <b>of</b> <b>live</b> <b>animals</b> as a very specific type of transport. The first part of work is about legislation, which {{is related to the}} transport <b>of</b> <b>live</b> <b>animals.</b> There is the description of the requirements for the carrying on the transport <b>of</b> <b>live</b> <b>animals,</b> necessary documents, permissions and equipment of the means of transport. In the next part of work the statistics related to the transport <b>of</b> <b>live</b> <b>animals</b> are given. For example there are the numbers <b>of</b> transported <b>live</b> <b>animals,</b> the numbers <b>of</b> checking or the numbers of the infringements of the rules. Then a description of two specific international transports <b>of</b> <b>live</b> <b>animals</b> implemented by Czech zoological gardens is presented. The final part of work is about the company Boby-Fleisch, which is specialised in the transport <b>of</b> <b>live</b> <b>animals...</b>|$|R

50|$|There are varying {{cultural}} attitudes {{throughout the}} world {{with regard to the}} broad subject of animal husbandry.

40|$|We {{present a}} new, plaster model for {{measuring}} operative environmental temperature (Te) and water loss of amphibians {{with little or}} no cutaneous resistance to water loss. These models are made from molds <b>of</b> <b>live</b> <b>animals,</b> cast in plaster of Paris, and can be fitted with water reservoirs that allow them to be used for extended periods. Plaster models did not differ significantly in Te or water loss rate from either identically shaped models made of 3 % agar and measured in a wind tunnel or from live cane toads (Bufo marinus) measured outdoors in a variety of conditions. Thus, plaster models offer an accurate measure of both Te and water loss across a range of environmental conditions. The plaster models are also relatively simple to make and offer several advantages over other model types, in that they are durable, they do not shrink like agar models, they can be colored to match absorptivity <b>of</b> <b>live</b> <b>animals,</b> and they can be made in postures representative <b>of</b> <b>live</b> <b>animals...</b>|$|R
