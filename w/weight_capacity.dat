2500|$|All L-4 models, {{as well as}} similar, tandem-cockpit {{accommodation}} aircraft from Aeronca and Taylorcraft, were collectively nicknamed [...] "Grasshoppers", {{though the}} L-4 was almost universally referred to by its civilian designation of Cub. [...] The L-4 was used extensively in World War II for reconnaissance, transporting supplies, artillery spotting duties and medical evacuation of wounded soldiers. [...] During the Allied invasion of France in June 1944, the L-4's slow cruising speed and low-level maneuverability — alongside examples of the Auster AOP aircraft occasionally used by the British Army and other Commonwealth forces for the same purposes — made it an ideal observation platform for spotting hidden German tanks, antitank gun emplacements and Sturmgeschütz and Jagdpanzer tank destroyers waiting in ambush in the hedgerowed bocage country south of the invasion beaches. [...] For these operations, the pilot generally carried both an observer/radio operator and a 25-pound communications radio, a load that often exceeded the plane's specified <b>weight</b> <b>capacity.</b> [...] After the Allied breakout in France, L-4s were also sometimes equipped with improvised racks, usually in pairs or quartets, of infantry bazookas for ground attack against German armored units. [...] The most famous of these L-4 ground attack planes was Rosie the Rocketer, piloted by Maj. Charles [...] "Bazooka Charlie" [...] Carpenter, whose six bazooka rocket launchers were credited with eliminating six enemy tanks and several armored cars during its wartime service, especially during the Battle of Arracourt.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{stochastic}} {{programs with}} first-stage binary variables and capacity constraints, using simple penalties for capacities violations. In particular, {{we take a}} closer look at the knapsack problem with <b>weights</b> and <b>capacity</b> following independent random variables and prove that the problem is weakly NP -hard in general. We provide pseudo-polynomial algorithms for three special cases of the problem: constant <b>weights</b> and <b>capacity</b> uniformly distributed, subset sum with Gaussian weights and strictly positively distributed random capacity, and subset sum with constant weights and arbitrary random capacity. We then turn to a branch-and-cut algorithm based on the outer approximation of the objective function. We provide computational results for the stochastic knapsack problem (i) with Gaussian <b>weights</b> and constant <b>capacity</b> and (ii) with constant <b>weights</b> and <b>capacity</b> uniformly distributed, on randomly generated instances inspired by computational results for the knapsack problem.

2500|$|In January 2012, General Atomics {{released}} a new trailing arm {{design for the}} Reaper's main landing gear; benefits include an over 30 percent increase in landing <b>weight</b> <b>capacity,</b> a 12 percent increase in gross takeoff weight (from [...] to [...] ), a maintenance-free shock absorber (eliminating the need for nitrogen pressurization), a fully rejected takeoff brake system, and provisions for automatic takeoff and landing capability and Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) field upgrades. In April 2012, General Atomics announced possible upgrades to USAF Reapers, including two extra [...] fuel pods under the wings to increase endurance to 37 hours. The wingspan can also be increased to , increasing endurance to 42 hours. The USAF has bought 38 Reaper Extended Range (ER) versions, carrying external fuel tanks (which don't affect weapon capacity), the heavy-weight landing gear, a four-bladed propeller, a new fuel management system which ensures fuel and thermal balance among external tank, wing, and fuselage fuel sources, and an alcohol water injection (AWI) system to shorten required runway takeoff length; these features increase endurance from 27 to 33–35 hours, while the company is still pitching the lengthened wing option. The Reaper ER first flew operationally in August 2015. The aircraft also has the sensor ball replaced with a high-definition camera, better communications so ground controllers can see the higher quality video, software to enable automatic detection of threats and tracking of 12 moving targets at once, {{and the ability to}} [...] "super ripple" [...] fire missiles within 0.32 seconds of each other.|$|E
2500|$|Motorization {{clearly had}} a {{military}} application, providing trucks and drivers {{that could be}} used by the military. In addition, Todt's report cited troop transportation as a reason to develop highways: he stated that using 100,000 requisitioned vehicles, {{it would be possible to}} transport 300,000 shock troops the width of the Reich in two nights. A second memorandum written six months later by Gottfried Feder also stressed military uses. The military disagreed. Georg Halter, professor of road construction and railroads at the Technical University of Munich and a Nazi Party member, wrote several pieces beginning in fall 1933 in which he contested Todt's report, with respect to strategic applications pointing out that road vehicles had less than a third of the <b>weight</b> <b>capacity</b> of railroad freight wagons, in addition to which the steel wheel-rims and treads of armored vehicles would severely damage the roadway. He also regarded the light-colored concrete that was to be used for the roadways as a guide for enemy aircraft (beginning in 1937, the surface was tinted black for this reason, which distressed Hitler) and the planned large viaducts as tempting targets, [...] "like honey to wasps". Border segments that could have been useful at the start of the war had not been completed because of earlier fears that enemies would use them to invade, and weight testing was not performed until March 1939. The German military rarely used the autobahns for troop movements (one of the exceptions being transporting flak units); they were used much more extensively at war's end by the advancing Allies, who did indeed damage them in the process. In fact as the war continued, fuel shortages led the German military to make increasing use of horses rather than motorized transportation.|$|E
