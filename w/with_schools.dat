5|$|The fishing market, {{historically}} {{has always had}} a porpoise bycatch. In 1981, it was legal to kill 22,500 porpoises per year to catch yellowfin tuna. This type of tuna has been known to follow porpoises, and when fishermen find these tuna, more often than not, a porpoise is also entangled in a net. Sometimes, a pod of porpoises are herded along <b>with</b> <b>schools</b> of tuna, and when fishermen cast a seine, the porpoises are trapped in the net, and drown because they can't surface. Today, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 has enforced the use of safer fishing equipment to reduce bycatch.|$|E
5|$|Oman's National Committee for Civil Defence {{coordinated the}} country's {{preparations}} for Phet, utilizing a national disaster plan that organized the various ministries, and providing early warnings. Storm warnings were broadcast in seven languages, {{a response to}} there being only English and Arabic warnings during Cyclone Gonu, which struck Oman in 2007.

Nationwide, 12,870people evacuated, utilizing 91 government-opened shelters. Omani officials shut down the country's {{oil and gas production}} facilities during the storm.|$|E
5|$|The Czech events {{weakened}} {{the position of}} the Habsburgs in Silesia, where there were large concentrations of ethnically Polish inhabitants, whose ties and interests at that time placed them within the Protestant camp. Numerous Polish Lutheran parishes, <b>with</b> <b>schools</b> and centers of cultural activity, had been established in the heavily Polish areas around Opole and Cieszyn in eastern Silesia, as well as in numerous cities and towns throughout the region and beyond, including Breslau (Wrocław) and Grünberg (Zielona Góra). The threat posed by a potentially resurgent Habsburg monarchy to the situation of Polish Silesians was keenly felt, and there were voices within King Sigismund's circle, including Stanisław Łubieński and Jerzy Zbaraski, who brought to his attention Poland's historic rights and options in the area. The King, an ardent Catholic, advised by many not to involve the Commonwealth on the Catholic-Habsburg side, decided in the end to act in their support, but unofficially.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jennifer Crittenden. She came into the writers' room and pitched {{the idea that there}} should be a teachers' strike in an episode. Then-show runner David Mirkin thought the episode had a lot of potential, and much of it is based on his {{experience}} as a child <b>with</b> <b>schools</b> running out of money. Despite the title of the episode, at no point does the PTA (Parent-Teacher Association) actually disband. The title was suggested by Mirkin and was intended to poke fun at Crittenden, who thought the most exciting part of the teachers going on strike would be that the PTA might disband. In addition to this, Mirkin added a character to the episode who, on thinking the PTA has disbanded, jumps panicking out of a window. He jumps back in the same window when he is told the PTA has not disbanded.|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{relationship}} between school anxiety and academic achievement of students. This study analyzed the relationship between school anxiety and academic achievement in a sample of 520 Spanish students from 12 to 18 years (M = 15. 38, SD = 1. 95). Results revealed that students with high performance in Spanish language (language and literature) had significantly higher scores in anxiety faced <b>with</b> <b>school</b> failure and punishment, anxiety faced with aggression, behavioral anxiety and psychophysiological anxiety. Similarly, students with high performance in mathematics had significantly higher scores in anxiety faced <b>with</b> <b>school</b> failure and punishment, anxiety faced with aggression and behavioral anxiety. Furthermore, students with academic success scored significantly higher in anxiety faced <b>with</b> <b>school</b> failure and punishment, behavioral anxiety and psychophysiological anxiety. However, students <b>with</b> <b>school</b> failure had significantly higher scores on anxiety faced with social evaluation. Finally, anxiety faced <b>with</b> <b>school</b> failure and punishment {{was a significant predictor of}} high achievement in Spanish language (language and literature) and mathematics, whereas anxiety faced <b>with</b> <b>school</b> failure and punishment and anxiety faced with social evaluation were significant predictors of overall academic success. Thus, the results indicate a higher academic performance of students who have certain fears school. These results could be used by teachers, school psychologists and clinical psychologists as an empirical basis to develop preventive and effective intervention of underachievement...|$|R
