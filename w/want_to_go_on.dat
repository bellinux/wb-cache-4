500|$|Despite {{the success}} of the serial, Kneale felt that he had now taken the {{character}} of Quatermass as far as he could. [...] "I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> repeating because Professor Quatermass had already saved the world from ultimate destruction three times, and that {{seemed to me to be}} quite enough," [...] he said in 1986. It was also his final new collaboration with Rudolph Cartier, although the director did later handle a new version of Kneale's 1953 adaptation of Wuthering Heights for the BBC in 1962.|$|E

You feel different every album, and [...] this stage I feel like I {{want to do a}} lot of uptempo [...]" [...] The same year, Rihanna dismissed her innocent image for an edgier look with a new hairstyle, which was inspired by actress Charlize Theron's bob cut in the 2005 science fiction thriller Æon Flux.|$|E

It makes us <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> a holiday." [...] The reviewer from OK! magazine agreed saying [...] "quite frankly the whole thing has us aching for a summer holiday" [...] and then compared it a holiday the group might go on. [...] "All in all it's a pretty standard summer for the girls who show off super toned physiques, plenty of midriff and a collection of maxi-dresses we can't help, but covet." ...|$|E

500|$|By {{the summer}} of 1957, Kneale {{was working on the}} scripts for a third and final BBC serial. Titled Quatermass and the Pit and again {{produced}} and directed by Cartier, this was eventually broadcast in December 1958 and January 1959. John Robinson was no longer available to play Quatermass, so the role was offered instead to Alec Clunes. Clunes turned down the part, and it was offered once more to André Morell, who this time accepted. Morell has been praised by several reviewers as having given the definitive portrayal of Quatermass. The serial itself has been praised by the BBC's own website as [...] "simply the first finest thing the BBC ever made. It justifies licence fees to this day." [...] Despite this success, Kneale was unsure about whether the character would ever return, later telling an interviewer: [...] "I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> repeating because Professor Quatermass had already saved the world from ultimate destruction three times, and that {{seemed to me to be}} quite enough." ...|$|E
500|$|Eidelman {{stated that}} he finds science fiction the most {{interesting}} and exciting genre to compose for, and that Meyer told him to treat the film as a fresh start, rather than drawing on old Star Trek themes. Eidelman wanted the music to aid the visuals; for Rura Penthe, he strove to create an atmosphere that reflected the alien and dangerous setting, introducing exotic instruments for color. Besides using percussion from around the world, Eidelman treated the choir as percussion, with the Klingon language translation for [...] "to be, or not to be" [...] ("taH pagh, taHbe") being repeated in the background. Spock's theme {{was designed to be}} an ethereal counterpart to the motif for Kirk and the Enterprise, aimed at capturing [...] "the emotional gleam in the captain's eye". Kirk's internal dilemma about what the future holds was echoed in the main theme: [...] "It's Kirk taking control one last time and as he looks out into the stars he has the spark again [...] But there's an unresolved note, because it's very important that he doesn't trust the Klingons. He doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> this trip even though the spark is there that overtook him." [...] For the climactic battle, Eidelman starts the music quietly, building the intensity as the battle progresses.|$|E
500|$|A major {{rift between}} Johnson and Millererstwhile rivals for the Australian captaincydeveloped during the Fourth Test, played at Kensington Oval in Barbados. During the third day, Miller, bowling fast-medium swingers, had {{dismissed}} Everton Weekes and Collie Smith {{in quick succession}} to leave the West Indies at 6/147 with Denis Atkinson and Clairmonte Depeiaza batting. Johnson, thinking that the two batsmen would be vulnerable to express pace, asked Miller to increase his bowling speed. [...] When Miller refused, Johnson remonstrated with him: [...] "I'll say who bowls and what they bowl". With Miller refusing to bowl as directed, Johnson replaced him in the attack with Ray Lindwall. [...] Walking off the field {{at the end of}} the day's play and continuing in the dressing room, Miller provoked Johnson, telling him he [...] "couldn't captain a team of schoolboys", among other insults. Finally Johnson responded, asking [...] "If you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> like that why don't we go around the back and thrash it out?" [...] The much larger Miller declined the offer and the pair travelled back to the team hotel together. [...] The next day, Atkinson and Depeiaza batted throughout the entire day's play. [...] Their partnership of 347runs for the seventh wicket is still a world record.|$|E

500|$|Beastie Boys {{were signed}} as the opening act for the tour. Adam [...] "MCA" [...] Yauch {{of the group}} recollected: [...] "One day, Russell Simmons, co-founder of Def Jam Recordings, came in and said, 'Hey guess what—Madonna's manager called. Do you guys <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> tour with her?" [...] DeMann had asked for another group called The Fat Boys, but Simmons did not manage them and lied, saying [...] "Oh, the Fat Boys have another gig that week. What about Run–D.M.C.?" [...] But they were too {{expensive}} according to DeMann, and hence ultimately Beastie Boys were chosen. Adam [...] "Ad-Rock" [...] Horovitz from the band commented: [...] "It's not like any of us knew Madonna that much, but we all used to hang out at Dancetaria [...] so we knew about each other. I don't know why {{she thought it would}} be a good idea , though. It was a terrible idea. But it was great for her in a way because we were so awful that by the time she came onstage, the audience had to be happy." [...] The circular stage for the tour, consisted of three ramps around the perimeter, which were connected with each other. A long line of stairs descended to the main stage from the central ramp; it was flanked by the band. About 30 feet above the stage, the speakers were suspended from a circular beam. Four giant screens lined the outer perimeter of the stage, on three sides.|$|E

Martha and friends related that Bill did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> the road any more and that ticket sales for that planned tour of Germany {{in the fall of}} 1980 were slow.
