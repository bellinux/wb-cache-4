5|$|Omaha had terrible streets {{through the}} late 1880s, which caused many {{residents}} to believe the city was not progressing appropriately. This lack of responsiveness by the city government was caused by property owners throughout the city who did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> improvements. On rainy days stagecoaches would sink up to their hubcaps, and residents wore knee-high boots to wade through the mud, and at times rivers ran through the streets.|$|E
25|$|Craig wrangled {{with the}} {{legislature}} over {{the creation of}} major highways around Indiana. The assembly didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the roads, so Craig recommended a toll road be created. The assembly leadership balked at the idea, as toll roads had been abolished decades earlier. The assembly finally authorized the Indiana Toll Road in northern Indiana, but refused to build anymore, primarily because they didn't want to allow the governor control over {{a large number of}} patronage positions which he could potentially use to gain more power in the party. His other construction recommendations, a state office building, new prisons, and the expansion of Purdue University were ignored by the assembly. They also refused what he believed his most economically valuable proposal, creating a shipping harbor on Lake Michigan.|$|E
25|$|Sponsor Philip Morris did {{not want}} to show day-old kinescopes to the major markets on the East Coast, yet neither did they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> the extra cost that filming, processing, and editing would require, {{pressuring}} Ball and Arnaz to relocate to New York City. Ball and Arnaz offered to take a pay cut to finance filming, on the condition that their company, Desilu, would retain the rights to that film once it was aired. CBS relinquished the show rights to Desilu after initial broadcast, not realizing they were giving away a valuable and durable asset. In 1957, CBS bought the rights back for $1,000,000 ($ in today's terms), which provided Ball and Arnaz the down payment for the purchase of the former RKO Pictures studios, which became Desilu Studios.|$|E

25|$|In doing so, {{the company}} faced several {{simultaneous}} challenges: creating {{a lot of}} intricate user-facing software from scratch or from existing code which must target all the disparate Linux environment versions; integrating a corporate personality into the existing and outspoken volunteer community of the GNOME desktop environment; building upon a very small nascent market of Linux desktop users amongst an already widely served and monopolized desktop computing market; and monetizing free software for individual consumers by creating essential business services. In other words, Eazel sought to switch a groundswell of users from Macintosh and Windows to a new and immature system that free software users would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for.</b> Of the two predominant free desktop environments for Linux, the choice to target GNOME instead of KDE was made {{largely because of the}} questionable legality of the Qt license upon which KDE was based.|$|E

The Army received its first seven JLTVs for test {{at the end of}} September 2016 according to Colonel Shane Fullmer, JLTV project manager stated at an AUSA 2016 media briefing. He said test vehicles would be sent to Yuma, Arizona, for automotive and mobility testing; to Ft Huachuca, Arizona, for cyber, electronic warfare, and C4 testing; Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, for reliability and automotive testing; and to Alaska for automotive and environmental testing. Some JLTV testing was deferred during the EMD phase, as the government did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> testing with three suppliers, and it is now set for testing with a fleet of 100 JLTVs. By April 2017 30 JLTVs had been delivered, testing expected to continue through the first quarter of FY19. Also at an AUSA 2016 media briefing, Scott Davis, program executive officer for Combat Support & Combat Service Support, stated that Overall the JLTV programme expects to cut about five years off of the total program and save about US$5.9 billion, as Oshkosh's final competitive bid was low enough so the army decided to 'buy to budget' and get more platforms each year, which shrunk the total length of the contract and increased cost avoidances accrued each year. At AUSA 2016, Oshkosh displayed a JLTV General Purpose variant equipped with an EOS R-400S-MK2 remote weapon system integrated with Orbital ATK's M230 LF 30mm lightweight automatic chain gun.|$|E
