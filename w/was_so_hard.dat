5|$|Work on the {{foundations}} for the lighthouse continued until 30 September. A total of 296 charges were used to remove 2,000tons of rock and Stevenson believed that the rock <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> that the effort involved was four times that required for boring Aberdeenshire granite. The work went well {{but by the end}} of the second season, no blocks had yet been laid. However, between April 1839 and June 1840 4,300 blocks had been fashioned, the stone donated by the Duke of Argyll from quarries on Mull. The roughly hewn rock was taken to Hynish where the blocks were hammered and chiselled into shape. The largest weighed over 2.5tons, the smallest 0.75tons and the precision required meant that a single block could take 320 man hours to complete.|$|E

25|$|A short-coming in the tunnel's {{design was}} the lack of any lighting, {{emergency}} exits or water deviation. Specifically, the lighting made inspection difficult. This was especially important since there was nothing hindering water from dripping down on the tracks, electrical systems and signaling system. This oftentimes caused cracks in the rails and ties. Poor geological conditions resulted in a net being hung up over the rails to hinder rocks from falling down. The decay <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> that it was oftentimes not possible for NSB to keep up. A total replacement of the railway's superstructure was therefore necessary in the early 1990s.|$|E

500|$|Plans {{called for}} a second {{airfield}} at Salami Plantation, but surveys revealed that the site was unsuitable and a new site {{was found in a}} coconut plantation near Mokerang. While the 46th Naval Construction Battalion cleared an access road, the 836th Engineer Aviation Battalion constructed the runway, and the 104th and 46th Naval Construction Battalions built the taxiways and dispersal areas. As at Momote, the humus had to be removed to reach the coral subgrade, which was then graded and compacted. In places the coral <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> explosives had to be used. The work required the clearing of [...] and the removal of 18,000 coconut trees. B-24s of 307th Bombardment Group (the [...] "Long Rangers") arrived on 21 April 1944. They participated in raids on Biak and supported the Battle of Biak in May.|$|E

500|$|To {{create the}} Mummy, Berton used a {{combination}} of live action and computer graphics. Then, he matched the digital prosthetic make-up pieces on Vosloo's face during filming. Berton said, [...] "When you see his film image, that's him. When he turns his head and half of his face is missing {{and you can see}} right through on to his teeth, that's really his face. And that's why it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> to do." [...] Vosloo described the filming as a [...] "whole new thing" [...] for him; [...] "They had to put these little red tracking lights all over my face so they could map in the special effects. A lot of the time I was walking around the set looking like a Christmas tree." [...] Make-Up Effects Supervisor Nick Dudman produced the physical creature effects in the film, including three-dimensional make-up and prosthetics. He also designed all of the animatronic effects. While the film made extensive use of computer generated imagery, many scenes, including ones where Rachel Weisz's character is covered with rats and locusts, were real, using live animals.|$|E

And then, so, for this, uh, this contract with Island Def Jam, in the beginning I separated it to this English language album, and I don't do Japanese translations. I just, my integrity as an artist just would not take that, could not take that." ...|$|E
500|$|Oppong debuted {{and made}} his first start for the Eastern Kentucky Colonels in their season opener on November 14, 2008, against Florida International. He led his team in both rebounds and blocks. In the {{following}} week, he was named Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) Newcomer of the Week. In a win over Ball State on December 13, he recorded 11 points and a season-high 9 rebounds. However, on December 20, he separated his left shoulder after grabbing a team-high 8 rebounds vs Cincinnati. It was estimated by head coach Jeff Neubauer that he would miss a few weeks due to a torn labrum. Oppong was absent for the Colonels' five next games. He recalled the moment saying, [...] "Cincinnati {{was one of our}} best games, but for me, I really don't like that game. It was when I actually dislocated my shoulder. And it hurt—it really hurt. The process of coming back <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> because it took so long. When I got back, it took me a minute {{to get back into the}} flow and get adjusted." [...] Oppong return on January 15, 2009, against Eastern Illinois, and did not make another start that season until a loss to Morehead State at the 2009 Ohio Valley Conference Men's Basketball Tournament. Through the whole season, Oppong averaged 9.2 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 1.2 assists. He was one of Eastern Kentucky's rebounding leaders.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} week of July, deaths among the refugee {{community}} were occurring at a rate of 600 per week, and two weeks later had reached 2000 per week as the refugee population increased and the health situation worsened. Mortality rates reached a height during a 24-hour period in late July when the death toll near Goma from cholera, diarrhea and other diseases was 7000. Over 50,000 people died, mainly from a cholera epidemic that swept through the camps. The refugees near Goma were located at Mugunga on a plain of volcanic rock, which <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> that the French troops and aid workers were unable to dig graves for the bodies that began to line roads.

The Gemara provided a third explanation of the word [...] "enough!": God was telling Moses not to petition him anymore, so that people should not say: [...] "How severe is the Master, and how persistent is the student." [...] The Gemara explained why God <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> on Moses with a Baraita taught in the School of Rabbi Ishmael: according to the camel is the burden; that is, a stronger, more righteous one must bear a greater burden.|$|E

She also inflicted self-harm, banging her head against the wall when feeling unattractive. She traced her fragility to her abusive marriage to recording artist James DeBarge when she was 16 years old. Jackson recalled, [...] "It all has to do with very low self esteem. Especially going into a relationship like that very young... someone telling you things like, 'no one is ever going to want you again, you should be happy here with me.'" [...] Attempting to alter his behavior and drug addiction, she explained, [...] "I learned the hard way that you can't change a person." [...] Recalling her divorce, she revealed, [...] "There came a point when I finally said, 'You know what? I just don't care what happens.' I had to do what I wanted to but had been too afraid to.

2500|$|The bloom of Moscow's cavalry, {{troops that}} happily {{accomplished}} campaigns of year 54 and 55 have perished {{in one day}} — the victors got only about 5000 captive. The unfortunate were led onto an open space and slaughtered like lambs — that was the agreement between the Crimean Khan and the hetman of the Zaporozhian Cossacks! Never again was the tsar of Moscow able to master an army that strong. In mourning clothes showed himself Alexei Mikhailovich {{to the people and}} the terror seized Moscow. The blow <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> because it was unexpected, and it followed such illustrious successes! It was only recently that Dolgoruki brought to Moscow a captured Lithuanian hetman, only recently was everyone talking about successes of Khovansky — and now Trubetskoy, for whom everyone had hopes higher than for others, and who was [...] "a man devout and graceful, in military affairs skilled and a fright for a foe" [...] — has ruined such a huge army! After capture of so many towns, after capture of the Lithuanian capital the royal city trembled for its own security: in August by tsar's decree people of all ranks hurried to build fortifications around Moscow. Often the tsar and the boyars were present themselves during the construction; people from outlying areas, their families with meagre belongings filled Moscow, and a rumour spread that the tsar was leaving to beyond the Volga and Yaroslavl.|$|E
2500|$|The {{defenders}} at Boundary Khor were dug {{in behind}} fields {{of barbed wire}} and Castagnuola had contacted Gondar for air support. Italian bombers and fighters attacked all day, shot down seven Gladiators for a loss of five Fiat CR-42s and destroyed the lorry carrying spare parts for the tanks. The ground <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> and rocky {{that there were no}} trenches and when Italian bombers made their biggest attack, the infantry had no cover. An ammunition lorry was set on fire by burning grass and the sound was taken to be an Italian counter-attack from behind. When a platoon advanced towards the sound with fixed bayonets, some troops thought that they were retreating. Part of the 1st Battalion, Essex Regiment at the fort broke and ran, taking some of the Gahrwalis with them. Many of the British fugitives mounted their transport and drove off, spreading the panic and some of the runaways reached Doka before being stopped. The Italian bombers returned next morning and Slim ordered a withdrawal from Gallabat Ridge [...] west to less exposed ground that evening. Sappers from the 21st Field Company remained behind to demolish the remaining buildings and stores in the fort. The artillery bombarded Gallabat and Metemma and set off Italian ammunition dumps full of pyrotechnics. British casualties since 6 November were [...] killed and [...] The brigade patrolled to deny the fort to the Italians and on 9 November, two Baluch companies attacked and held the fort during the day and retired in the evening. During the night an Italian counter-attack was repulsed by artillery-fire and next morning the British re-occupied the fort unopposed. Ambushes were laid and prevented Italian reinforcements from occupying the fort or the hills on the flanks, despite frequent bombing by the Regia Aeronautica.|$|E
