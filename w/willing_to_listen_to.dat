5|$|The {{program had}} some loose ends that {{manifested}} themselves later. Many refugees were not economically integrated and lived from government handouts. Critics {{noted that the}} refugees had become a special interest group that fostered resentment. The COMIGAL officials often decided not to split up refugees belonging to the same village, hoping to maintain social continuity. In some cases, Catholic priests refused to obey government directives to settle in certain areas. Many of the refugees also refused to relocate from the camps {{on the outskirts of}} the capital, wanting to live an urban lifestyle, and objecting to Diem's desire that they help developed inhospitable frontier territory where disease was more common and the economy less developed. On occasions, the reluctance to disperse away from Saigon resulted in protests outside Diem's residence. Many Catholic villages were effectively transplanted into southern territory. This was efficient in the short run but meant that they would never assimilate into southern society. They had little contact with the Buddhist majority and often held them in contempt, sometimes flying the Vatican flag instead of the national flag. Peter Hansen, an Australian Catholic priest and academic scholar of religion, has added that tensions between northern and southern Catholics were also present, due to issues of regionalism and local traditions. Hansen also said that northern Catholics took a more defensive attitude towards other religions than their southern co-religionists, and were more likely to see non-Catholics as a threat. He further noted that northern Catholics had a more theocratic outlook in that they were more <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the advice of priests on a wide range of issues, not only spiritual and ecclesiastical matters. These differences and the sense of segregation persist to the current day.|$|E
25|$|In February 1921 a new Secretary of State for War, Laming Worthington-Evans, {{was more}} <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> Wilson’s advice. The Irish War of Independence reached a climax {{in the first}} half of 1921, with deaths of pro-Crown forces running at {{approximately}} double the rate of those in the second half of 1920. Wilson still urged unity of military and police command, which Macready did not want.|$|E
25|$|Ögedei {{was also}} {{known to be}} a humble man, who did not believe himself to be a genius, and who was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> and use the great generals that his father left him, as well as those he himself found to be most capable. He was the Emperor (Khagan) but not a dictator. Like all Mongols at his time, he was raised and educated as a warrior from childhood, and as the son of Genghis Khan, he was a part of his father's plan to {{establish}} a world empire. His military experience was notable for his willingness to listen to his generals and adapt to circumstances. He was an extremely pragmatic person, much like his father, and looked at the end rather than the means. His steadiness of character and dependability were the traits that his father most valued, and that gained him the role of successor to his father, despite his two older brothers.|$|E

25|$|As the 2011–12 {{season began}} to unfold, Columbus {{recorded}} a dismal 2–12–1 record, the worst start to an NHL season by {{any team in}} 19 years. With the team struggling, rumors began circulating that the Blue Jackets were contemplating trading Nash {{as a solution to}} their on-ice woes. While Blue Jackets General Manager Scott Howson stated publicly that he had had no discussions regarding a Nash deal, other teams had indeed inquired about his availability. When asked about it, Nash stated that if the franchise felt it could improve itself by dealing him, {{he would be willing to}} waive his no-trade clause in order to get the deal done. Though Howson had previously maintained that he had no intention of trading Nash, two weeks before the trade deadline, he stated in the press that the team was open to all options and they were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> trade proposals for Nash, despite not actively shopping him. Speculation was that in return for Nash the Blue Jackets would ask for a top six forward, a top prospect and a first-round draft pick.|$|E
25|$|William II, who {{was more}} popular than his father, was also more <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> his advisors. When the Revolutions of 1848 raged {{throughout}} Europe, with nationalists and liberals revolting and sometimes killing noblemen and royals in the process, William II was genuinely concerned for his safety and to lose his powers. Overnight, he changed from a conservative to a liberal, and agreed to the far-reaching Constitutional Reform of 1848 on 11 October 1848. He accepted the introduction of full ministerial responsibility in the constitution, leading {{to a system of}} parliamentary democracy, with the House of Representatives directly elected by the voters within a system of single-winner electoral districts. Parliament was accorded the right to amend government law proposals and to hold investigative hearings. The States-Provincial, themselves elected by the voter, appointed by majorities for each province the members of the Senate from a select group of upper class citizens. A commission chaired by the liberal Thorbecke was appointed to draft the new proposed constitution, which was finished on 19 June. Suffrage was enlarged (though still limited to census suffrage), as was the bill of rights with the freedom of assembly, the privacy of correspondence, freedom of ecclesiastical organisation and the freedom of education.|$|E
25|$|Meeting at {{the reserve}} at 08:00 on Wednesday, the sailors learned of Fraser's remarks. Although not all were {{happy with the}} details of the new pay rates, it was agreed that their first demand had been met. By 08:10, the mutineers began to march to the gates of Philomel, where, upon being stopped by the Master-At-Arms, they asked to present their demands in {{relation}} to lower-deck committees and the foregoing of punishment for the mutiny to Commander Phipps. Although <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the sailors, the only response Phipps could give was that they should return to duty, accept punishment for their actions, and bring their concerns to official channels. While still at the gates, Doctor Martyn Finlay, the local member of parliament, addressed the mutineers and informed them that the government would consider their requests, with the prime minister to respond in two hours. Fraser arrived at the reserve at noon to personally address the sailors, but most had gone home by this point, with plans to reassemble the next morning. Those remaining listened as Fraser told them that queries regarding the pay package would have been better handled through official channels, and that the sailors should return to work and accept any punishment offered, but did not take his advice.|$|E

500|$|Pugh {{was one of}} Bournemouth's most {{consistent}} players as they made an indifferent start to 2011–12, having scored 4 goals from 11 appearances by mid-September 2011. Bournemouth opened contract talks with him in December 2011, and he opted to bide his time over the offer of a new three-and-a-half-year deal to concentrate on his playing performances. Pugh finished 2011–12 as Bournemouth's top scorer for the second season running, with 12 goals from 49 appearances, while they finished in 11th place in League One. He was voted the Bournemouth Daily Echo Supporters' Player of the Year; this newspaper described him as [...] "a rare shining light during an up-and-down campaign". He decided not to sign a new contract with Bournemouth in July 2012, and the club was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> offers for him.|$|E

500|$|Atlético were {{promoted}} to La Liga {{at the end}} of the 2001–02 season, although Torres did not perform well in the season, as he netted only 6 times in 36 appearances in the Segunda División. Torres' first season in La Liga, 2002–03, was better, however, as he scored 13 goals in 29 appearances, with Atlético finishing in 11th place. In July 2003, soon after his takeover of the club, Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich had a £28million bid for Torres rejected by Atlético's board of directors. In the 2003–04 season, his second in La Liga, Torres made further strides, scoring 19 league goals in 35 appearances, meaning he finished as the joint third-highest scorer in the league. At age 19, Torres was named Atlético's captain. Atlético narrowly missed out on qualification for the UEFA Cup, but by finishing in seventh place in the 2003–04 season, they qualified for the 2004 UEFA Intertoto Cup, giving Torres a first taste of a competition at the European level. He scored two goals in the two fourth round matches against OFK Beograd, with one coming in each leg. Atlético reached the final, but lost 3–1 on a penalty shoot-out to Villarreal following a 2–2 draw on aggregate. FA Premier League champions Chelsea were believed to be interested in signing Torres during the summer of 2005, but Atlético club president Enrique Cerezo said that they had [...] "no chance" [...] of signing him. Cerezo later said in January 2006 that the club was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> offers for Torres, and Torres claimed Newcastle United of the FA Premier League had made a bid to sign him in March.|$|E
