25|$|The {{design of}} the rear {{suspension}} made for poor ride quality and, as the Board discovered, made the vehicles liable to experience rear <b>wheel</b> <b>spin.</b> This resulted in an accident in May 1986 when the driver of Cub no. 611 lost control and the vehicle crashed into a tree, with four of the occupants ending up in hospital.|$|E
25|$|Car Life {{magazine}} bestowed {{its annual}} Award for Engineering Excellence on the 1963 Sting Ray. Chevy's small-block V-8 – {{the most consistent}} component of past Corvette performance – was rated by the buff books to be even better in the Sting Ray. The 1963 was noted to have an edge over past models in both traction and handling because the new independent rear suspension reduced <b>wheel</b> <b>spin</b> compared to the live-axle cars.|$|E
25|$|The floor {{selector}} lever {{also has an}} S position. When S is selected, sport mode is activated in the DSG. Sport mode still functions as a fully automatic mode, identical in operation to D mode, but upshifts and downshifts are made much higher up the engine rev-range. This aids a more sporty driving manner, by utilising considerably more of the available engine power, and also maximising engine braking. However, this mode does have a detrimental effect on the vehicle fuel consumption, when compared to D mode. This mode may not be ideal to use when wanting to drive in a sedate manner; nor when road conditions are very slippery, due to ice, snow or torrential rain — because loss of tire traction may be experienced (<b>wheel</b> <b>spin</b> during acceleration, and may also result in road wheel locking during downshifts at high engine rpms under closed throttle). On 4motion or quattro-equipped vehicles this may be partially offset by the drivetrain maintaining full-time engagement of the rear differential in S mode, so power distribution under loss of front-wheel traction may be marginally improved.|$|E

500|$|In 1970, two new franchises {{were awarded}} in the NHL [...] the Buffalo Sabres and the Vancouver Canucks. [...] It was a foregone {{conclusion}} Perreault {{would be the first}} selection in the 1970 Entry Draft. The two new teams took part in a roulette <b>wheel</b> <b>spin</b> to determine who would get the first pick. Ultimately, the Canucks were allocated numbers 1-10 on the wheel, while the Sabres had 11-20. When league president Clarence Campbell spun the wheel, he initially thought the pointer landed on 1 and started to congratulate the Vancouver delegation. [...] However, Sabres coach/general manager Punch Imlach asked Campbell to check again. As it turned out, the pointer was on 11. [...] Imlach had chosen 11 for the roulette <b>wheel</b> <b>spin</b> because it was his favourite number. This was the first year the Montreal Canadiens did not have a priority right to draft Québécois junior players. Consequently, Perreault was available and taken first overall by the Sabres.|$|E
2500|$|Wheel Slide Protection (WSP) {{equipment}} is fitted to passenger trains {{to manage the}} behaviour of wheel sets in low adhesion conditions.

The potential payoffs are $2,000–$1,500–$1,000 ($2,500–$2,000–$1,500 starting in season 2), or $500 ($1,000 starting in season 2) for an unsuccessful match. If the champion manages a lucky Star <b>Wheel</b> <b>spin,</b> as in earlier versions, the value is doubled for a payoff of up to $4,000 ($5,000 starting in season 2).|$|E

2500|$|For the 1992 model year, the [...] LT1 {{engine was}} introduced, an {{increase}} of [...] over 1991's L98 engine. This engine featured reverse-flow cooling (the heads were cooled before the block), which allowed for a higher compression ratio of 10.5:1. A new distributor was also debuted. Called [...] "Optispark", the distributor was driven directly off {{the front of the}} camshaft and mounted in front of the timing cover, just above the crankshaft and harmonic balancer. Also new for 1992 was Acceleration Slip Regulation (ASR), a form of traction control which utilized the Corvette's brakes, spark retard, and throttle close-down to prevent excessive rear <b>wheel</b> <b>spin</b> and possible loss of control. The traction control device could be switched off if desired.|$|E

50|$|When the {{traction}} control computer (often incorporated into another control unit, {{such as the}} ABS module) detects one or more driven <b>wheels</b> <b>spinning</b> significantly faster than another, it invokes the ABS electronic control unit to apply brake friction to <b>wheels</b> <b>spinning</b> with lessened traction. Braking action on slipping wheel(s) will cause power transfer to wheel axle(s) with traction due to the mechanical action within the differential. All-wheel drive (AWD) vehicles often have an electronically controlled coupling system in the transfer case or transaxle engaged (active part-time AWD), or locked-up tighter (in a true full-time set up driving all wheels with some power all the time) to supply non-slipping wheels with torque.|$|R
50|$|Slip (also {{known as}} creep) is {{normally}} roughly {{directly proportional to}} tractive effort. An exception is if the tractive effort is so high that the wheel is close to substantial slipping (more than just a few percent as discussed above), then slip rapidly increases with tractive effort {{and is no longer}} linear. With a little higher applied tractive effort the <b>wheel</b> <b>spins</b> out of control and the adhesion drops resulting in the <b>wheel</b> <b>spinning</b> even faster. This is the type of slipping that is observable by eye—the slip of say 2% for traction is only observed by instruments. Such rapid slip may result in excessive wear or damage.|$|R
