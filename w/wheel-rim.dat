5000|$|The Isle of Man Examiner, dated 19 June 1920, quotes that Levis won {{the first}} 3 places in the Lightweight class of the Junior race. The article also states that no prize was awarded for the Lightweight class as the finishers' times were all 30 minutes slower than the winner's time. The article does not state if it refers to prize money or some other finisher's award. However, R.O Clark riding for Levis {{finished}} in 4th place overall and was within the 30 minute limit for a [...] "prize", despite a puncture at Windy Corner on the last-lap, and then completed the 1920 Junior Race on a <b>wheel-rim.</b>|$|E
50|$|Goods traffic {{had been}} {{constant}} for many years. The chief materials brought into Lowestoft included coal (from Leicester and Melton Mowbray), bricks (to Lowestoft North), pipes, glass, sheet metal plates, flour, beer, grain and <b>wheel-rims</b> to be exported to the Netherlands. Goods sent out from Lowestoft included canned foods, wood cases and fish to London and Bury St. Edmunds. Between 1899 and 1914, a Travelling Post Office left the station at 2000 each evening, reaching Ipswich at 2340.|$|R
50|$|Thus the FG01 did not promise much {{in terms}} of performance. It was angular and bulky, with poor {{aerodynamic}} performance negatively affecting grip and handling; it had a plump nose, initially no airbox, and was overweight and under-powered, using a small Ford-Cosworth ED V8 customer engine largely financed by Ford do Brasil, which developed an estimated 100 bhp less than the most powerful engine in the field, the Renault V10 supplied to the Benetton and Williams teams. It was also the only car to have a manual gearbox in the 1995 F1 season. The only attractive thing about the car was its blue and yellow colour scheme accompanied by fluorescent green <b>wheel-rims,</b> illustrating the team's Brazilian influence in its first year. Rinland subsequently left the team after a few weeks, after falling out with the team's management over the car's lack of competitiveness.|$|R

5000|$|The tundra-style tire {{has been}} {{independently}} invented {{at different times}} and places. In North America its post-World War II invention is credited to Canadian Welland Phipps, potentially inspired by the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company's pre-World War II development of their own, similar low-pressure [...] "airwheel" [...] as a complete <b>wheel-rim</b> and tire set — said {{to be of the}} [...] "Musselman" [...] type from , for its original inventor, Alvin J. Musselman — which was introduced to the American public in the late summer of 1929, and becoming available in the United Kingdom by 1930. It was initially offered by Goodyear in fully inflated diameters up to 46 inches (117 cm), with a thirty-inch (76 cm) diameter in Goodyear's lineup having similar dimensions as seen in the British Flight magazine announcement, to a currently-available size of 21st century-available tundra tire.|$|E
5000|$|After the presoak {{application}}, a {{car wash}} tunnel's layout can vary greatly. In some car washes, presoak application {{is followed by}} an empty space, or idle zone. This provides time for the presoak to loosen dirt on the car. In many cases, wheel cleaning equipment, such as sill brushes or high pressure wheel blasters, are placed in the idle zone. A sill brush (also known as a wheel brush or tire brush) consists of an 8-foot-long brush assembly which is pushed against the car's wheels and door sill area. Sill brushes are typically use flagged bristle, as dirt is usually most heavily concentrated on the lower parts of the car. The material on a sill brush may have alternating lengths or use material which is intentionally mounted off-center to allow wheel surfaces of various depths to be cleaned. Sill brushes rely on the rotation of a customer's car's wheels {{in order to achieve}} complete wheel contact. Similarly to the CTAs, wheel brushes often only activate when the customer buys a wheel cleaning upgrade. Some car washes use <b>wheel-rim</b> disc brushes in addition to or in place of sill brushes. These assemblies extend out towards the wheel and follow it at the same speed as the conveyor while rotating at high speeds to clean the wheels. These devices are popular in car washes that use belt conveyors, as a belt conveyor prevents the wheels of a customer's car from rotating and thus renders sill brushes useless for wheel cleaning. Some car washes feature multiple sets of wheel brushes and offer multiple levels of wheel cleaning. Tracking high pressure wheel blasters consist of assemblies with multiple nozzles that follow a car's wheel over a distance. While following a car's wheel, a wheel blaster directs high-pressure water at the wheel. The following motion may be achieved by having the nozzles pivot to face the wheel or by having the nozzles move alongside the car at the same speed as the conveyor. At the end of a car wash's presoak idle zone is often a high pressure arch. High pressure arches direct high pressure water at a vehicle's surface. This may be done [...] "V-jet" [...] nozzles, rotating [...] "turbo" [...] nozzles, spinning manifolds, and oscillating and/or pivoting manifolds. Some high pressure systems maintain a constant distance from the vehicle to provide more consistent results. Separate high pressure top, wheel, and/or side blasters may be present in place of or supplementary to a high pressure arch.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a semi-empirical combined-slip tiremodel including transient behavior. The method relies on theassumption that the transient behavior {{is a result}} from the dynamicdeformation of the tire carcass and that the interaction between thelateral and longitudinal slip and forces {{can be explained by}} thedeformation of the rubber treads. The deformation of the tire carcassmakes the tread slip deviate from the <b>wheel-rim</b> motion in a way thatmay be described by differential equations. A method based onbrush-model tire mechanics is used to construct the combined-slipforces as nonlinearscalings of corresponding pure-slip forces...|$|E
5000|$|In 1859, {{at the age}} of 23, John Marston's {{apprenticeship}} was competed and {{he bought}} Daniel Smith Lester's japanning business at Bilston which had amalgamated with Fred Walton & Company and Thurston and Company and established his own business John Marston Limited, producing japanned tin goods. He did so well that when Perry died in 1871 Marston took over the business and merged it with his own.John Marston began making bicycles in 1877 with the trademark Sunbeam suggested by his wife. The factory was renamed Sunbeamland and Marston based his production on high build quality, with enclosure lubricated chains, which until 1936 became the best cycles on the market. [...] The top model was the 'Golden' with alloy <b>wheel-rims,</b> epicyclic two- and three-speed gears and real gold-leaf pin-striping. The 'Royal' was of the same quality but had red lining and simpler equipment. These and other models were made at 'Sunbeamland', Pool Street, Wolverhampton until 1937 and subsequently, to the same designs, by AMC and BSA until 1957.|$|R
2500|$|Motorization {{clearly had}} a {{military}} application, providing trucks and drivers {{that could be}} used by the military. In addition, Todt's report cited troop transportation as a reason to develop highways: he stated that using 100,000 requisitioned vehicles, {{it would be possible to}} transport 300,000 shock troops the width of the Reich in two nights. A second memorandum written six months later by Gottfried Feder also stressed military uses. The military disagreed. Georg Halter, professor of road construction and railroads at the Technical University of Munich and a Nazi Party member, wrote several pieces beginning in fall 1933 in which he contested Todt's report, with respect to strategic applications pointing out that road vehicles had less than a third of the weight capacity of railroad freight wagons, in addition to which the steel <b>wheel-rims</b> and treads of armored vehicles would severely damage the roadway. He also regarded the light-colored concrete that was to be used for the roadways as a guide for enemy aircraft (beginning in 1937, the surface was tinted black for this reason, which distressed Hitler) and the planned large viaducts as tempting targets, [...] "like honey to wasps". Border segments that could have been useful at the start of the war had not been completed because of earlier fears that enemies would use them to invade, and weight testing was not performed until March 1939. The German military rarely used the autobahns for troop movements (one of the exceptions being transporting flak units); they were used much more extensively at war's end by the advancing Allies, who did indeed damage them in the process. In fact as the war continued, fuel shortages led the German military to make increasing use of horses rather than motorized transportation.|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of formation and the regularity of shrinkage distributionin a cast-steel wheel were simulated by computer methods. SolidWorks softwarepackage {{was used to}} produce a three-dimensional model of the cast parts, and Experto ViewCastsoftware package was employed to simulate the casting process. The simulatedresults show that the mold filling was smooth and thus no splashing occurred. However, shrinkage and porosityappeared at the transition phase between the <b>wheel-rim</b> and web {{during the process of}} solidification. The reason for that isthe imperfect solidification sequence. The fast cooling rate in the final thin web position led to the block of feeding channel at the transition area. The foundry technique was improved successfully by computer-aided methods. The volume of shrinkage was reduced by applying an insulating material, which made thecastings solidify progressively as designed. The performance of the wheel produced by the improved technology agreed very well with the technical requirements...|$|E
