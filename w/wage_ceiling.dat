40|$|Decades of underinvestment {{in public}} sectors and in {{teachers}} and health workers have adversely affected {{the health and}} educational outcomes of women. This is partly explained by {{a general lack of}} resources. However, the amount a country can spend on social sectors, including teachers and health workers, is also determined by its macroeconomic framework, which is set in agreement with the International Monetary Fund.

Though the IMF has recently removed <b>wage</b> <b>ceilings</b> from its basket of conditions, little change has taken place to ensure that women are better supported by macroeconomic policies or, at the least, are less adversely affected. Thus far, the IMF’s neoliberal policies have either ignored gender concerns or instrumentalized equity, health, and education to support economic development. Unless macroeconomic policies are more flexible and deliberately take into account the different needs of women and men, social outcomes will continue to be poor and inequitable. Governments must pursue alternative, feminist policies that put the goals of social equity at the center of macroeconomic policy. These policies can facilitate increased investment in education and health care, which are vital measures for achieving gender equality and providing both women and men with the skills and training needed to soften the impact of the current economic crisis...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{minimum wage}} laws can trace their lineage {{all the way}} back to the Ordinance of Laborers of 1349, which was decreed by King Edward the Third of England that set a maximum wage for laborers in medieval England. King Edward was forced to this end due to the large portion of his laborers falling ill and {{perishing}} from catching the Black Plague. The 1300 s were the last time a <b>wage</b> <b>ceiling</b> was needed for this means and ever since then wage regulations have come in the form of wage floors commonly referred to as the minimum wage. The first country to enact a modern national minimum wage was New Zealand in 1894, the United States had its first statutory national minimum wage introduced in 1938 (Richard, 2016). The minimum wage in the United States has been one of the most hotly debated topics of the last presidential election and for years before that as well. Minimum wage in the United States has been debated in nearly every congressional session, often with no resolution. In 2007, the federal minimum wage was raised to $ 5. 85 an hour; prior to this increase, the minimum wage had not changed since 1997. During that time, the cost of goods had increased by nearly 23 percent, while housing and higher education costs went up even more significantly (Richard, 2016). Raising of the minimum wage is believed to have one main negative cause and that is to increase the level of unemployment of the economy. The issue surrounding raising the minimum wage is not regarding whether the higher wage will increase unemployment but, however, on whether or not the benefits felt by the economy outweigh the costs incurred by the decreased employment...|$|E

40|$|Labor-importing {{countries}} adopt differing {{immigration policy}} on foreign workers. They all restrict the number allowed entry and many set <b>wage</b> <b>ceilings</b> at levels below the wage paid the native workers. The differing {{restrictive immigration policies}} result in the segmentation of the world labor market and large inequality in wage rates for any one occupation or skill.

The other variables exerts their expected influence in a significant way but destination proves to have the strongest influence on foreign wage.

40|$|Includes bibliographyAs in {{many other}} countries, the {{viability}} and sustainability of social security systems in the Caribbean is of concern to policy makers. Although systems in the region remain relatively young, liquid and healthy at this time, timely reform is necessary to prevent {{a crisis in the}} future. Reform is required to grapple with population ageing, a fairly large informal (non-contributing); sector in some countries, high open unemployment and the impact of Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS);. Caribbean social security systems (pension branch); are defined benefits pay-as-you-go (PAYG); systems that are largely publicly managed. The performance of the systems has been creditable on average, with the accumulation of substantial reserves though administrative costs are too high. Some countries in the region have pursued parametric reforms-mainly increases in contribution rates and retirement age and adjustment to <b>wage</b> <b>ceilings</b> to maintain the viability of the systems in the future. These reforms could, through various transmission effects, impact on sustainability of social security systems themselves, but also labour markets, capital markets and economic performance. Importantly, in considering reform options, countries should not rule out including a structural reform pillar, similar to an individual retirement account, which could allow contributors to match their appetite for risk with desire for higher returns. Moreover, there is the possibility that this could have a beneficial effect on savings and investment.

40|$|The International Monetary Fund’s recent claims {{concerning}} {{its impact}} on public health are evaluated against available data. First, the IMF claims that health spending either does not change or increases with IMF-supported programs, but there is substantial evidence to the contrary. Second, the IMF claims to have relaxed strict spending requirements {{in response to the}} 2008 – 9 financial crisis, but there is no evidence supporting this claim, and some limited evidence from the Center for Economic Policy Research contradicting it. Third, the IMF states that <b>wage</b> <b>ceilings</b> on public health are no longer part of its explicit conditionalities to poor countries, as governments can choose how to achieve public spending targets; but in practice, ministers are left with few viable alternatives than to reduce health budgets to achieve specific IMF-mandated targets, so the result effectively preserves former policy. Fourth, the IMF’s claim that it has increased aid to poor countries also seems to be contradicted by its policies of diverting aid to reserves, as well as evidence that a very small fraction of the Fund’s new lending in response to the financial crisis has reached poor countries. Finally, the IMF’s claim that it follows public health standards in tobacco control contrasts with its existing policies, which fail to follow the guidelines recommended by the World Bank and World Health Organization. The authors recommend that the IMF (1) become more transparent in its policies, practices, and data to allow improved independent evaluations of {{its impact on}} public health (including Health Impact Assessment) and (2) review considerable public health evidence indicating a negative association between its current policies and public health outcomes...|$|R

From here, I will compare the structural differences and similarities in the salary cap and revenue sharing models of each league to determine the impact of these policies on income parity. The results reveal that MLB is the most unequal of the leagues as measured by GINI index, variance of league salaries, and average variance of team salaries {{as a result of a}} soft salary cap and weak revenue sharing model.

40|$|Between 1970 and today, {{the share}} of {{national}} income going to labour (wage share) has fallen significantly more in advanced capitalist countries with strong labour unions and a coordinated wage bargaining system, than in countries like the UK, with weak trade unions and a highly deregulated and decentralised labour market.

Strong conservative central banks contain strong trade unions, which incorporate the low-inflation strategy of the central banks into their own wage demands. Low inflation can be obtained through a low growth rate of unit labour costs: nominal <b>wages</b> face a <b>ceiling</b> set by inflation plus productivity.
