25|$|The Beaujolais {{region has}} one of the highest vine density ratios of any major {{worldwide}} wine region, with anywhere from 9000 to 13,000 vines per hectare. Most vines are trained in the traditional gobelet style, where the spurs of the vines are pushed upwards and arranged in a circle, resembling a chalice. This method has its roots in the Roman style of vine training and has only recently begun to fall out of favor for the guyot method which involves taking a single or double spur and training it out horizontally. Harvest usually occurs in late September and is almost universally done by hand rather than with the use of mechanical harvesters. This is because the Beaujolais wine-making style of carbonic maceration utilizes <b>whole</b> <b>bunches</b> <b>of</b> grape clusters that normally get broken and separated by a mechanical harvester.|$|R

500|$|Former {{executives}} at Sega have mixed {{opinions of the}} 32X. [...] Bayless believes firmly that the 32X serves {{as a warning to}} the video game industry not to risk splintering the market for consoles by creating add-ons, and was critical of the Kinect and PlayStation Move for doing so. [...] Franz places the 32X's commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a CD drive, despite its compatibility with the Sega CD, stating, [...] "The 32X was destined to die because it didn't have a CD drive and was an add-on. [...] An add-on device is never as well thought out as a built-from-scratch device." [...] Miller, on the other hand, remembers the 32X positively, stating, [...] "I think the 32X actually was an interesting, viable platform. The timing was wrong, and certainly our ability to stick with it, given what we did with Saturn, was severely limited. There were a <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> reasons why we couldn’t ultimately do what we had to do with that platform, without third party support and with the timing of Saturn, but I still think the project was a success for a bunch of other reasons.

He also observed that the characters are all heterosexual and only one cast member is over 40. Knox commented [...] "Wonderland boasts TVs sexiest cast, which compensates for material that is sometimes pedestrian and antics used in place of character-based humour."

5000|$|Hans was {{a little}} man who owned a {{beautiful}} garden where he grew flowers of all kinds and colors which were sold in the market to make some money. He enjoyed the company of another man called Hugh, a miller who used to visit Hans very often during the summer time and with whom he shared thoughts about friendship and loyalty. Hans was so devoted to Hugh that he even gifted him <b>whole</b> <b>bunches</b> <b>of</b> flowers from his own garden.However when winter came Hans {{found himself in a}} very difficult situation as his flowers wouldn't flourish anymore until the following spring. Since his main source of money wasn't available he lived of the profits he had made during the summer, but one winter was so stark that he had to sell some of his useful gardening tools, including his wheelbarrow and some silver buttons. Meanwhile, the miller lived comfortably in his own house and avoided visiting his friend or helping him in any way not to make him jealous and spoil if not break their friendship.Finally a new season came and it was time for Hans to pick some of his newly flowered roses and daffodils and sell them. Nevertheless he couldn't because he sold his wheelbarrow. Hugh finally visited him after a long time and hearing about his problem he decides to kindly gift him one of his old wheelbarrows in exchange of a few favors. Hans accepted the deal but the unceasing requests of the miller kept him so busy that he couldn't even take care of his own garden!One day Hans was asked to go and seek for a doctor for Hugh’s son had hurt himself but it was a stormy and rainy night and he could barely see where he was going. After finding the doctor, on the way back home he got lost and drowned in a hole full of water. Hugh, of course, attended Hans funeral and concluded with the following sentence: “A great loss to me at any rate," [...] answered the Miller; [...] "why, I had as good as given him my wheelbarrow, and now I really don't {{know what to do with}} it. It is very much in my way at home, and it is in such bad repair that I could not get anything for it if I sold it. I will certainly take care not to give away anything again.

The pair confessed to needing the money acquired from Gina's murder to fund a killing spree, which would include purchasing two Ghostface costumes, as well as a voice-changer used by the character in the film. During their trial, psychologist Madeline Levine who studied the effect of violence on children, stated, [...] "There were a <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> reasons why they acted out that way.

500|$|The {{writing process}} {{consumed}} approximately six months, including three months creating notes and analyzing the novel. Zaillian noted that as time progressed, the writing accelerated. [...] "As {{soon as you}} start making decisions," [...] he explained, [...] "you start cutting off {{all of the other}} possibilities of things that could happen. [...] So with every decision that you make you are removing a <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> other possibilities of where that story can go or what that character can do." [...] Given the book's sizable length, Zaillian deleted elements to match Fincher's desired running time. Even so, Zaillan took significant departures from the book. To Zaillian, there was always a [...] "low-grade" [...] anxiety, [...] "but I was never doing anything specifically to please or displease," [...] he continued. [...] "I was simply trying to tell the story the best way I could, and push that out of my mind. I didn't change anything {{just for the sake of}} changing it. There's a lot right about the book, but that part, I thought we could do it a different way, and it could be a nice surprise for the people that have read it." ...|$|E

6000|$|A like {{inversion}} {{of the natural}} order of things results from the absence of temporal conjunctions. In Japanese, though nouns can be added, actions cannot; you can say [...] "hat and coat," [...] but not [...] "dressed and came." [...] Conjunctions are used only for space, never for time. Objects that exist together can be joined in speech, but it is not allowable thus to connect consecutive events. [...] "Having dressed, came" [...] is the Japanese idiom. To speak otherwise would be to violate the unities. For a Japanese sentence is a single rounded <b>whole,</b> not a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> facts loosely tied together. It is as much a unit in its composition as a novel or a drama is with us. Such artistic periods, however, are anything but convenient. In their nicely contrived involution they strikingly resemble those curious nests of Chinese boxes, where entire shells lie closely packed one within another,--a very marvel of ingenious and perfectly unnecessary construction. One must be antipodally comprehensive to entertain the idea; as it is, the idea entertains us.|$|R
40|$|The {{method of}} {{molecular}} dynamics (MD) {{is widely used}} to study static and dynamic properties of the condensed matter [1]. In particular an approach to study the relaxation of metastable states is developed [2]. These states play essential role in the impulse loading processes such as shock compression, laser ablation, etc. Herewith we report on simulation technique and results for crystallization of the supercooled Al melt. As a phase transition (relaxation of the metastable state) in a single MD run is a random event one needs to perform the <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> such runs starting from different microscopical configurations (which correspond to the same macroscopical state).

Many of his friends, a group {{which came to}} be known as [...] "the Dreamlanders" [...] (and who included Divine, Lochary, Mary Vivian Pearce and Mink Stole), appeared in some of his low-budget productions, filmed on Sunday afternoons. Following the production of his first short film, Hag in a Black Leather Jacket (1964), Waters began production of a second work, Roman Candles (1966). This film was influenced by the pop artist Andy Warhol's Chelsea Girls (1966), and consisted of three 8-millimeter movies played simultaneously side by side. Roman Candles was the first film to star Divine, in this instance in drag as a smoking nun. It featured the Dreamlanders modeling shoplifted clothes and performing various unrelated activities. Being both a short film and of an avant-garde nature, Roman Candles never received widespread distribution, instead holding its premier at the annual Mt. Vernon Flower Mart in Baltimore, which had become popular with [...] "elderly dames, young faggots and hustlers, and of course a <b>whole</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> hippies".
