500|$|Reflecting Zappa's eclectic {{approach}} to music, the next album, Cruising with Ruben & the Jets (1968), was very different. It represented {{a collection of}} doo-wop songs; listeners and critics were not sure whether the album was a satire or a tribute. Zappa later noted that the album was conceived in the way Stravinsky's compositions were in his neo-classical period: [...] "If he could take the forms and clichés of the classical era and pervert them, <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> the same... to doo-wop in the fifties?" [...] A theme from Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring is heard during one song.|$|E
2500|$|Bedi has {{expressed}} strong opinions on {{many aspects of}} modern-day cricket and {{has been described as}} [...] "being jealous of modern day great spinners". In particular, he was a vehement critic of the bowling action of Muttiah Muralitharan ("if Murali doesn't chuck, then show me how to bowl") which he bluntly referred to as cheating and likened to a javelin throw and shot putting, saying that Muralitharan would [...] "complete 1000 Test wickets but they would count as mere run-outs in my eyes". He takes a very dim view of chucking, which he calls [...] "a bigger threat than bribing and betting" [...] and claimed in 2004 that many bowlers on the subcontinent chuck, calling Muralitharan a [...] "Sri Lankan bandit closing in on a dream artist called Shane Warne". He has stated, though, that he has nothing personal against Muralitharan, although Muralitharan has threatened to sue him. He levelled the same criticisms against his countryman Harbhajan Singh. Regarding suspect actions in cricket, he said [...] "When a bowler is chucking, he's referred to panels and the home cricket board. <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> the same for a wide or no-ball, then?". He has accused one-day cricket, modern cricket bats and small grounds of causing a decline in classical spin bowling in India.|$|E

He explained his decision: It’s indefensible. I just can’t defend this at all. It’s Eurovision for God’s sake. It’s all shite, everyone knows that. But I just don't care. I'm doing it for a laugh. Of course I'm going to get people slagging me off, but I'm used to all that. [...] I just thought, <b>why</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> it?" [...] he says.

Then they'd be in with me the next week and I'd say 'lads, you're brilliant – three number ones in a row, well done'. I actually like Ronan and I like Keith as people, but I don't like their music.
