Comparison of weld shapes between conventional TIG welding, TIG welding with coupling arc tungsten electrode and GPCA-TIG welding with coupling arc tungsten electrode were made. During this process, the weld shape is characterized with the weld depth D, weld width W and the undercut U. The value of undercut U is referred as the larger surface depression in the weld brim. Based on these, the influences of major welding parameters on weld shape were investigated.|$|E

Current commercial solid modelers are incapable of storing explicitly product and process definitions of weld features. This work presents a paradigm to develop a computer-aided engineering environment that supports complete weld feature information in a solid model and create an automatic programming system for robotic arc welding;In the first part, welding features are treated as properties or attributes of an object, features which are portions of the object surface [...] the topological boundary. The structure for representing the features and attributes is a graph called the Welding Attribute Graph (WAGRAPH). The method associates appropriate weld features to geometric primitives, adds welding attributes, and checks the validity of <b>welding</b> <b>specifications.</b> A systematic structure is provided to incorporate welding attributes and coordinate system information in a CSG tree.

A methodology of knowledge acquisition using statistical methods is proposed. It is shown that these procedures did little to capture the private knowledge of experts (heuristics), but helped in determining general dependencies, and trends.

Focus is on the <b>weld</b> process <b>specification,</b> and the importance ofuse of as realistic as possible weld process parameters in the weld simulations. Considerable interpretation is often required of the weld designer and of the FE modeller when simulatinga weld process.

Difficulties in interpretation could be substantially reduced through the use of industrial methods of <b>specification,</b> <b>weld</b> process <b>specifications</b> (WPS).

One full-scale developmental article produced under the Ares 1 Upper Stage project is the Manufacturing Demonstration Article (MDA) Barrel. This presentation {{will focus on the}} welded assembly of this barrel section, and associated lessons learned. Among the MDA articles planned on the Ares 1 Program, the Barrel was the first to be completed, primarily because the process of manufacture from piece parts (barrel panels) utilized the most mature friction stir process planned for use on the Ares US program: Conventional fixed pin Friction Stir Welding (FSW). This process is in use on other space launch systems, including the Shuttle s External Tank, the Delta IV common booster core, the Delta II, and the Atlas V rockets. The goals for the MDA Barrel development were several fold: 1) to prove out Marshall Space Flight Center s new Vertical Weld Tool for use in manufacture of cylindrical barrel sections, 2) to serve as a first run for weld qualification to a new <b>weld</b> <b>specification,</b> and 3) to provide a full size cylindrical section for downstream use in precision cleaning and Spray-on Foam Insulation development.
