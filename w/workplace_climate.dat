That change, in this case, is the implementation of new technology – electronic medical records (EMRs) – in nursing homes. A case study of eight nursing homes (on average 255 beds) in the New York City area is used to identify different workplace issues and managerial approaches to dealing with conflict. The research question examined is how organizations with the same types {{of conflict}} can experience vastly different workplace climates. The preliminary findings indicate that different perspectives, not merely types, of conflict were what shaped either a positive or negative <b>workplace</b> <b>climate.</b> Three managerial approaches to dealing with conflict are identified, and <b>workplace</b> <b>climate</b> is illustrated in feedback from personal interviews with both managers and front-line staff at eight of the ten homes.

40|$|Workplace {{learning}} {{is becoming a}} central tenet for {{a large proportion of}} today's employees. This seems especially true for so-called knowledge workers. Today, it remains unclear how differences in the quality of workplace learning are affected by differences in perception of the workplace environment and the motivation of knowledge workers to learn. Moreover, the possible role of motivation as a mediating factor between <b>workplace</b> <b>climate</b> factors and {{learning is}} underexplored. This paper therefore investigates direct and indirect links between perceptions of the <b>workplace</b> <b>climate,</b> motivation to learn and approaches to learning in the workplace. Knowledge workers (N = 202) in one knowledge intensive organisation were questioned using existing and adapted questionnaires to measure learning approaches, motivation and <b>workplace</b> <b>climate.</b> Correlations and multivariate regression analyses were carried out to assess direct relationships amongst variables. Path analysis was carried out to assess the mediating role of motivation. Results show that both <b>workplace</b> <b>climate</b> factors and motivation directly influence employees' approaches to learning. Some direct relationships between <b>workplace</b> <b>climate</b> factors and motivation were also uncovered. Results regarding the mediating role of motivation showed that the effect of good supervision on deep learning is completely mediated by autonomous motivation. The effect of choice independence on deep learning approach is partially mediated by the same motivational drive. A-motivation was found to partially mediate the link between good supervision and a surface disorganised approach. Implications for research and practice are discussed...|$|E

The present thesis examines the relationship between <b>workplace</b> <b>climate</b> and workplace leaning and investigates the predictive power of leadership with regards to reflective skills. The research consisted of a comparative study of two organizations’ <b>workplace</b> <b>climate</b> and workplace learning (Company A, N= 32; Company B, N= 34), measured with the “Workplace Climate Questionnaire” and the “Knowledge Productivity Survey”, respectively. Our empirical results show that <b>workplace</b> <b>climate</b> and workplace learning are indeed related; however our expectation of confirming that leadership exerts an influence on reflective skills was not supported. These findings may suggest that, in the current economic context outlined by the latest global economic crisis featured by downsizing, leadership {{may not be the}} prevailing influencing factor with regards to reflective skills and workplace learning, but other <b>workplace</b> <b>climate</b> features such as workload. This cue indicates that this subject matter may have evolved since the advent of the knowledge economy and new variables come into play.

40|$|This {{research}} {{undertaken in}} collaboration with Queensland Health analysed the links between dimensions of workplace climate/employee well-being contained {{in a number of}} Queensland Health databases, including the Patient Satisfaction Survey, the Clinical Incident database, the compliments and complaints database, the Variable Life Adjusted Display (VLAD) Database and the Better Workplaces Staff Opinion Survey database. Queensland Health sought to identify in what ways <b>workplace</b> <b>climate</b> is related to patient outcomes using existing datasets collected within the Queensland Health Centre for Healthcare Improvement. The process of establishing links involved matching aggregated data for specific facilities (where possible), or failing that, larger facilities (e. g. Hospital), or the Health Service District. Once the datasets had been matched on location or facility, correlations were calculated between the aggregated scores. The results demonstrated links between the data sets. These links showed that a better <b>workplace</b> <b>climate</b> is associated with greater reported numbers of clinical incidents, especially “no harm” clinical incidents. There was also a link between <b>workplace</b> <b>climate</b> and patient compliments/complaints which show that unsolicited compliments received from patients and their families are clearly related to a number of positive aspects of <b>workplace</b> <b>climate</b> (workplace morale, role clarity, and appraisal and recognition) and individual morale. The results linking <b>workplace</b> <b>climate</b> and patient satisfaction showed that there is a strong positive relationship between overall patient satisfaction and role clarity, and a negative relationship between overall patient satisfaction and both workplace distress and excessive work demands. While these results relate to historical data and therefore should not be construed to reflect the current state of operation within Queensland Health, they are still indicative of some very important relationships. This is the first study to demonstrate that more positive clinical management practices, better perceptions of the <b>workplace</b> <b>climate</b> and better employee well-being are a reflection of a better incident reporting and learning culture in a health care organization, ultimately resulting in improved patient outcomes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The study {{investigated}} {{the extent to which}} approaches to work, <b>workplace</b> <b>climate,</b> stress, burnout and satisfaction with medicine as a career in doctors aged about thirty are predicted by measures of learning style and personality measured five to twelve years earlier when the doctors were applicants to medical school or were medical students. Methods Prospective study of a large cohort of doctors. The participants were first studied when they applied to any of five UK medical schools in 1990. Postal questionnaires were sent to all doctors with a traceable address on the current or a previous Medical Register. The current questionnaire included measures of Approaches to Work, <b>Workplace</b> <b>Climate,</b> stress (General Health Questionnaire), burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory), and satisfaction with medicine as a career and personality (Big Five). Previous questionnaires had included measures of learning style (Study Process Questionnaire) and personality. Results Doctors' approaches to work were predicted by study habits and learning styles, both at application to medical school and in the final year. How doctors perceive their <b>workplace</b> <b>climate</b> and workload is predicted both by approaches to work and by measures of stress, burnout and satisfaction with medicine. These characteristics are partially predicted by trait measures of personality taken five years earlier. Stress, burnout and satisfaction also correlate with trait measures of personality taken five years earlier. Conclusions Differences in approach to work and perceived <b>workplace</b> <b>climate</b> seem mainly to reflect stable, long-term individual differences in doctors themselves, reflected in measures of personality and learning style. </p...|$|E
40|$|Employee {{engagement}} {{has become}} an important measure of employee performance {{and it has been}} linked to higher overall firm performance outcomes. Studies have shown that employee engagement may be impacted by both organizational culture and ethical <b>workplace</b> <b>climate.</b> For example, organizational culture is deep rooted and depending on the cultural dimensions most highly emphasized within a company, may have positive or negative impacts on employee performance indicators such as employee engagement. Whereas culture is deep rooted and does not easily change, climate is more fluid and can ebb and flow with different instances on-going within the organization. In addition, researchers have come to understand that <b>workplace</b> <b>climate</b> can be impacted relating to ethical issues and a measure of ethical <b>workplace</b> <b>climate</b> (EWC) has emerged to measure perceptions of employees relating to EWC. However, most studies only look at culture or climate, but not the two together, or specifically with employee engagement. This study examines employee perceptions of culture, ethical <b>workplace</b> <b>climate,</b> and employee engagement in a case study with employees in health care. The study findings show that the positive culture type and climate type identified can be associated with positive levels of employee engagement. Specifically, employees perceived a clan culture type to have an overall positive impact employee engagement. Findings about employee perceived climate type indicate that employees perceive a social climate type is associated with a positive link to higher employee engagement levels.

To assess the psychometric properties of a survey instrument combining items from several existing surveys of <b>workplace</b> <b>climate</b> and to generate a shorter instrument for future use. We fielded a 106 -item survey, which included items from 9 existing instruments, to all clinicians and staff members (n= 781) working in 30 California community clinics and health centers, receiving 628 responses (80 % response rate). We performed exploratory factor analysis of survey responses, followed by confirmatory factor analysis of 200 reserved survey responses. We generated a new, shorter survey instrument of items with strong factor loadings. Six factors, including 44 survey items, emerged from the exploratory analysis. Two factors (Clinic Workload and Teamwork) were independent from the others.

An online-survey was used to assess a cross-sectional sample of K- 12 teachers (N = 2222) nested in 207 schools in a large US school district. There was adequate agreement among teacher perceptions of school civility climate for aggregation and between-group variance of civility climate among schools. The results of hierarchical linear models revealed school-level civility climate perceptions were significantly negatively associated with lower levels of teacher experienced incivility, CWB-abuse and associated with higher levels job satisfaction and affective commitment, thus supporting four out of five hypotheses. However, school-level civility climate did not function as a moderator of the relationship between a teacher‟s experience of incivility and acts of CWB-abuse towards other teachers. The findings of this study provide evidence that shared perceptions of civility climate are associated with higher levels of individual-level employee well-being...|$|R

However, the central problem arising from the perception of risk of occupationally transmitted Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection amongst HCWs is that it may distract them from giving quality healthcare. Objectives: The study aimed at addressing the following objectives: to explore the effects of level or years of experience on risk perception regarding occupational exposure to HIV, to assess HCWs’ daily work routines’ consistency in accordance with universal precaution guidelines, to determine HCWs’ perception of <b>workplace</b> safety <b>climate</b> and identify factors that may constitute constraints to HCWs in adhering to universal precaution measures. Method: A descriptive cross-sectional survey design was utilised, using a triangulation method of data collection which involved the use of a questionnaire and direct observational methods using checklists. A total of 143 HCWs were purposively selected to form the study population. Results: The study showed a very high risk-perception amongst HCWs regarding occupational exposure to HIV and AIDS but a poor compliance with universal precautions in their professional duties. HCWs perception of risk and <b>workplace</b> safety <b>climate</b> did not influence their compliance with universal precautions (Pr > F = 0. 2566; Pr > F = 0. 2776).

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to develop and test a self-completed questionnaire for use in the routine assessment of work-related stress in a high-technology industrial organization. The initial phase of the study involved reviewing the existing literature to identify items and scales developed to assess workplace stress and strain. The initial item pool contained 92 items divided into 11 domains. Through a process of content validation using focus group discussions, the item pool was reduced to a 38 -item questionnaire covering eight domains: demands, control, support, role, relationships, rewards, change, and communications. These 38 items, along with other items included to enable psychometric testing, were converted to a web-based questionnaire. The entire workforce of the organization was invited to complete this questionnaire as part of the pilot study phase. Data from the pilot study were used to test scaling assumptions, evaluate the factor structure, estimate internal consistency reliability, and examine criterion and construct validity of the 38 -item <b>Workplace</b> <b>Climate</b> Questionnaire. The distribution of responses to questionnaire items tended to be skewed, with more respondents scoring among the more positive categories. With the exception of the role and relationships scales, no substantial floor and ceiling effects were seen for all the other scales. Each of the 38 -item <b>Workplace</b> <b>Climate</b> Questionnaire scales exhibited satisfactory internal-consistency reliability estimates. Items within the demands, control, support, and role scales loaded on the hypothesized scales, while items within the relationships, change, and rewards failed to load on the hypothesized scales. The pilot study provided support for criterion validity of the 38 -item <b>Workplace</b> <b>Climate</b> Questionnaire. As hypothesized, individual scales in the questionnaire correlated positively with similar constructs in existing occupational stress instruments. The pilot study also provided support for construct validity of the questionnaire. The demands, control, support, relationships, rewards, and change scales predicted the risk of poor self-reported mental health. Revisions to the 38 -item questionnaire resulted in the 22 -item <b>Workplace</b> <b>Climate</b> Questionnaire covering the following six domains: demands, control, role, rewards, support, and relationships.

This chapter focuses attention on issues of theory by critically evaluating different models {{of the relationship between}} employees’ approaches to workplace learning and their perceptions of the workplace context. In addition, this chapter focuses attention on issues of method by critically evaluating two particular instruments that {{have been devised}} in order to measure employees’ approaches to workplace learning and their perceptions of the workplace context. We use data from an online survey in which the Approaches to Work Questionnaire and the <b>Workplace</b> <b>Climate</b> Questionnaire were administered to employees who were taking courses by distance learning with the UK Open University. Factor analyses confirmed that both questionnaires measured three distinct scales. Canonical correlation analysis showed that the employees’ scores on the two instruments shared 43 % of their variance. Path analysis found evidence that variations in approaches to learning lead to variations in perceptions of the <b>workplace</b> <b>climate</b> but not for the converse relationship...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to begin {{exploring}} the relations of multiple dimensions of <b>workplace</b> substance use <b>climate</b> (substance availability, <b>workplace</b> descriptive norms, and workplace injunctive norms) to perceived workplace safety, work strain, and employee morale among employees who do not use alcohol or drugs at work. Data were collected from a probability sample of employed adults in the U. S. (N = 2051) who do not engage in workplace alcohol or drug use. The results showed that all three dimensions of <b>workplace</b> substance use <b>climate</b> were negatively related to workplace safety, positively related to work strain, and negatively related to employee morale. These results suggest that a permissive substance use climate at work may have broader relevance for the majority of employees who do not use alcohol and drugs at work. Keywords workplace substance use climate; norms; substance use; safety climate; workplace aggression; work strain; job satisfaction; organizational commitment; intention to stay Alcohol and drug use in the workplace have captured the interest of researchers, managers and policymakers (Frone, 2008).

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between <b>workplace</b> safety <b>climate</b> factors, individual psychological health factors, and self-reported errors and violation behaviours. The aim was to test hypotheses about different causal pathways for errors and procedural violations. A total of 308 aviation maintenance engineers completed a self-report questionnaire developed for this study. A structural model depicting workplace violations and psychological health acting as mediators between safety climate and errors was tested using structural equation modelling. The model fitted the data with safety climate accounting for 63 % of the variance in violations and 52 % of the variance in psychological health. Violations and psychological health combined to predict 58 % of the variance in errors. The study demonstrates the importance of including both organizational and individual level variables to assess the safety status of an organization through the use of expanded safety climate surveys...|$|R
30|$|There are {{a number}} of {{differences}} between the climate in the US <b>workplace</b> and the <b>climate</b> in the Pakistani workplace. For example, because the relationship between cultural values and workplace outcomes is stronger in culturally tight societies such as Pakistan, and is weaker in such culturally loose societies as the US (Taras et al. 2011), it would take a much greater effort to affect a change in the Pakistani workplace with regard to sexual harassment than it would in the US which is a loose and more fluid culture.|$|R
