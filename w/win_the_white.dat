5|$|The Republicans {{convened in}} Chicago and {{nominated}} former Speaker of the House James G. Blaine of Maine for {{president on the}} fourth ballot. Blaine's nomination alienated many Republicans who viewed Blaine as ambitious and immoral. The GOP standard bearer was weakened by alienating the Mugwumps, and the Conkling faction, recently disenfranchised by President Arthur. Democratic party leaders saw the Republicans' choice {{as an opportunity to}} <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House {{for the first time since}} 1856 if the right candidate could be found.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} part of the 19th century, Ohio was deemed a crucial battleground state; taking its electoral votes was thought {{essential}} for a Republican to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House. One way of, hopefully, assuring victory there was to nominate a son of Ohio. Between 1865 and 1929, every Republican president who first gained his office by election (that is, rather than succeeding on the death of his predecessor) was born in Ohio. Deadlocked Republican conventions in 1876, 1880, and 1888 turned to men born in Ohio, and in each case the nominee won the presidency. Thus, any successful Ohio Republican was a plausible president. One of McKinley's rivals among the Ohio contenders was Governor Joseph B. Foraker, but Foraker's light dimmed when he was defeated for a third two-year term in 1889.|$|E
25|$|Sagan {{started his}} {{season at the}} Tour of Qatar, taking his first podium spot of the season on Stage 4 by {{finishing}} second. He finished second again the next day. He concluded the race first in the youth classification to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> jersey. He subsequently headed to the Tour of Oman, failing to get his first season victory. He then participated to Tirreno–Adriatico, finishing second {{of the first and}} second stage. On Stage 6, Sagan took his first victory under the Tinkoff-Saxo colors in a flat stage which featured a lot of rain and breaks in the peloton. He finished the stage race in first in the points classification to earn the red jersey. He went on to compete in the Monument race Milan–San Remo, where he sprinted to a fourth position. In E3 Harelbeke, Sagan got clear of the main group with Geraint Thomas and Zdenek Stybar on the Oude Kwaremont with 41 kilometers left, but faded badly as Thomas attacked with 4 kilometers to go and finished 30th. Two days later, he finished tenth of Gent–Wevelgem, as only 39 riders finished the race. In April, he awarded himself the fourth place of the Tour of Flanders. He was chasing the leading duet with Greg Van Avermaet, but cracked in the finale, just like he did in the E3 Harelbeke. At Paris-Roubaix, he was in a group chasing the leaders, but had a mechanical problem with his shifter and had to change his bike in the final 10 kilometers, costing him precious time. He finished 23rd.|$|E

As the convention approached, Paul was one of seven candidates vying for the party's nomination. However, he and Means were the only candidates mentioned in the press. Speculation that Marrou could be chosen as a compromise candidate also surrounded the event, at which 800 attendees were expected.|$|E

2500|$|Frustrated with Taft's conservatism, Roosevelt belatedly {{tried to}} win the 1912 Republican nomination. He failed, walked out, and founded a third party, the Progressive, {{so-called}} [...] "Bull Moose" [...] Party, which called for wide-ranging progressive reforms. The split allowed the Democrats to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House. Following his election defeat, Roosevelt led a two-year expedition to the Amazon basin, where he nearly died of tropical disease. During World War I, he criticized President Woodrow Wilson for keeping the country {{out of the war}} with Germany, and his offer to lead volunteers to France was rejected. Though he had considered running for president again in 1920, Roosevelt's health continued to deteriorate, and he died in 1919.|$|E

2500|$|With a {{majority}} of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents {{under the age of}} 49 supporting legal recognition of same-sex marriages versus the opposition remaining from those over 50, the issue remains a particular divide within the Party. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has remarked that the [...] "Party is going to be torn on this issue" [...] with some constituents [...] "going to flake off". A Reuters/Ipsos survey from April 2015 found that 68% of Americans overall would attend the same-sex wedding of a loved one, with 56% of Republicans agreeing. Reuters journalist Jeff Mason remarked that [...] "Republicans who stake out strong opposition to gay marriage could be on shaky political ground if their ultimate goal is to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House" [...] given the divide between the social conservative stalwarts {{and the rest of the}} U.S. that opposes them.|$|E
2500|$|Since 2004, Vermont {{has been}} one of the Democrats' most loyal states. It gave John Kerry his fourth-largest margin of victory in the presidential {{campaign}} against George W. Bush; he won the state's popular vote by 20 percentage points, taking almost 59% of the vote. (Kerry, from neighboring Massachusetts, also became the first Northern Democrat ever to carry Vermont; Johnson was from Texas, Clinton from Arkansas and Al Gore, triumphant in the Green Mountain State in 2000, from Tennessee.) Essex County in the state's northeastern section was the only county to vote for Bush. Vermont is the only state that did not receive a visit from George W. Bush during his tenure as President of the United States. [...] Indeed, George W. Bush and Donald Trump are the only Republicans to <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House without carrying Vermont. In 2008, Vermont gave Barack Obama his third-largest margin of victory (37 percentage points) and third-largest vote share in the nation by his winning the state 68% to 31%. Only Obama's birth state of Hawaii and Washington, D.C. were stronger Democratic victories. The same held true in 2012, when Obama carried Vermont 67% of the vote vs 31% for Romney, and in 2016, when Clinton won with 55.7% of the vote vs 29.8% for Trump.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first series}} played in 1885 ended in dispute with no winner making the rematch {{a year later}} more heated. Game 2 saw the Browns win in a 12-0 romp. Bob Caruthers pitched a one-hitter, and left fielder Tip O'Neill smacked two inside-the-park home runs. It was the first two-home-run game by a player in a World Championship game. Despite the <b>win,</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Stockings had won Games 1 and 3 and took the series lead into St. Louis. Oddities {{happened}} in Game 5. With Jim McCormick and Jocko Flynn lame and John Clarkson tired‚ Chicago tried to use a minor league recruit in the pitcher's box‚ only to be refused by the Browns. Shortstop Ned Williamson and right fielder Jimmy Ryan ended up having to pitch. The Browns won easily 10-3. The sixth and final game began at an earlier time of 2:18 PM, so the full nine innings could be played. Pitching his fourth game in six days‚ Clarkson held St. Louis hitless for six innings as Chicago built a 3-0 lead. However, in the 8th, the Browns finally got to Clarkson {{to tie the game}} at 3, with Arlie Latham hitting a 2-run triple. In the 10th, Curt Welch scored on the [...] "$15‚000 slide" [...] after a wild pitch to win it in front of a fired-up St. Louis home crowd.|$|E

2500|$|Republicans {{continue}} {{to prevail in}} the outlying [...] Chicago exurban areas, as well as rural northern and central Illinois; Republican support is also strong in southern Illinois, outside the East St. Louis metropolitan area. From 1920 until 1972, the state was carried by the victor {{of each of these}} presidential elections – 14 elections. In fact, Illinois was long seen as a national bellwether, supporting the winner in every election in the 20th century except for 1916 and 1976. By contrast, Illinois has trended more toward the Democratic party and such, has voted for their presidential candidates in the last six elections; in 2000, George W. Bush became the first Republican to win the presidency without carrying Illinois or Vermont. Chicago resident and former president Barack Obama easily won the state's 21 electoral votes in 2008, with 61.9% of the vote. In 2010, incumbent Governor Pat Quinn was re-elected with 47% of the vote, while Republican Mark Kirk was elected to the Senate with 48% of the vote. In 2012, President Obama easily carried Illinois again with 58% to Republican Mitt Romney's 41%. In 2014, Republican Bruce Rauner defeated Governor Quinn 50% – 46% to become Illinois's first Republican governor in 12 years when he was sworn in on January 12, 2015, while Democratic Senator Dick Durbin was re-elected with 53% of the vote. In 2016, Hillary Clinton carried Illinois with 55% of the vote and Tammy Duckworth defeated incumbent Mark Kirk 54% to 40%. George W.
