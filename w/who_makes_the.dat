He works at a laboratory loosely based on Cold Spring Harbor. The character reminiscent of McClintock is a reclusive geneticist at the fictional laboratory, <b>who</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> same discoveries as her factual counterpart.|$|E
5|$|Harley's co-creator, Paul Dini, {{describes}} {{their relationship}} as Harley being someone <b>who</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> Joker {{feel better about}} himself, and who can do the work {{that he does not}} want to do himself. In the 1999 one-shot comic Batman: Harley Quinn, the Joker decides to kill Harley, after admitting that he does care for her, that their relationship is romantic, and that these feelings prevent him from fulfilling his purpose. Removing the traditional male-female relationship, such as in the Batman: Thrillkiller storyline where the Joker (Bianca Steeplechase) is a female and involved in a lesbian relationship with Harley, their relationship lacks any aspects of violence or subjugation.|$|E
5|$|The first-move {{advantage}} in chess is the inherent {{advantage of the}} player (White) <b>who</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> first move in chess. Chess players and theorists generally agree that White begins the game with some advantage. Since 1851, compiled statistics support this view; White consistently wins slightly more often than Black, usually scoring between 52 and 56percent. White's winning percentage {{is about the same}} for tournament games between humans and games between computers. However, White's advantage is less significant in blitz games and games between novices.|$|E

Furthermore, it is the soul alone <b>who</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> necessary efforts to achieve liberation without any divine grace.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{election}} pitting Paul Garrett against Morgan Wendell in the novel.

There is no material difference in the process of selecting a Chief Justice from that in the selection of Associate Justices. As with the other Justices of the Supreme Court, the Chief Justice is obliged to retire upon reaching the age of 70, otherwise there is no term limit for the Chief Justice. In the 1935 constitution, any person appointed by the president has to be confirmed by the Commission on Appointments; in the 1973 constitution, the person whom the president has appointed won't have to go confirmation under the Commission on Appointments.|$|E
25|$|Staal is an {{excellent}} skater, adept shot blocker and regular penalty killer with the Rangers. Offensively, he is a smart passer <b>who</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> intelligent plays to his teammates and generally plays positionally. Due to his skating ability, he periodically joins the offensive rush despite being a defenceman. He has a very accurate wrist shot and a hard slapshot that has improved in accuracy since his NHL debut. His improving offence led him to see more ice time on the power play beginning in the 2010–11 season, where he can apply those offensive skills more directly in the scoring effort. Upon entering the NHL, the Rangers coaching staff have primarily used him in a defensive role. However his point totals improved steadily his first few years in the NHL, and each year from 2007–08 to 2009–10, he established new career highs in goals, assists and points.|$|E
25|$|Coin tossing is {{a simple}} and {{unbiased}} way of settling a dispute or deciding between two or more arbitrary options. In a game theoretic analysis it provides even odds to both sides involved, requiring little effort and preventing the dispute from escalating into a struggle. It is used widely in sports and other games to decide arbitrary factors such as {{which side of the}} field a team will play from, or which side will attack or defend initially; these decisions may tend to favor one side, or may be neutral. Factors such as wind direction, the position of the sun, and other conditions may affect the decision. In team sports it is often the captain <b>who</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> call, while the umpire or referee usually oversees such proceedings. A competitive method may be used instead of a toss in some situations, for example in basketball the jump ball is employed, while the face-off plays a similar role in ice hockey.|$|E

CNN-IBN's Rajeev Masand found Khan to be a standout among the ensemble, adding that he has [...] "the least dialogue but the one <b>who</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> best impression". This was followed by three projects produced by Yash Raj Films: the action-thriller Tashan, the fantasy-drama Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic, and the animated film Roadside Romeo, all of which were not successful.|$|E
500|$|Responding to Steiner, Robert Stevens {{provides}} {{examples of}} what he categorises variously as offers, threats and throffers that fail to meet Steiner's definitions. He gives {{an example of an}} intervention he considers a throffer, as opposed to a threat, but in which both compliance and noncompliance are less preferable to the norm. The example is that of someone <b>who</b> <b>makes</b> <b>the</b> demand [...] "either you accept my offer of a handful of beans for your cow, or I kill you". For the subject, keeping the cow is preferred to both compliance and noncompliance with the throffer. Using this and other examples, Stevens argued that Steiner's account of differentiating the three kinds of interventions is incorrect.|$|E
