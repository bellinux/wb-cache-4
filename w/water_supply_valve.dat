50|$|During the Second {{world war}} Odessa city was {{surrounded}} by German and Romanian troops in 1941, {{and it was the}} hottest and driest period in July and August. Due to <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> system from the river, which was far from Odessa, was opened in 1973 in the Odessa city center and the system reached Moldavanka District later in 1980-1990s, the old city <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> system, including underground tanks and one-stage houses with shed roofs, was destroyed. Three and more stegs houses were built in Odessa from the end of 1890-s mostly and their roofs did not permit collection of enough rain water for the inhabitants. As result, thirst of water came in Odessa in August 1941, during the siege. The Soviet Marines were landed on German-occupied territory at <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> station between Odessa and river to give water for Odessa citizens during some hours only. Odessa citizens were informed in appropriate time to stand by at <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>valves,</b> as the Soviet military chiefs were confident of a positive result of the military operation to supply the city with water for a few hours only. <b>Water</b> <b>supply</b> was arranged by Soviet Mariners and the most of them was killed during the battle at the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> station.|$|R

In drip irrigation water is given to root of plants to save water and stop land infertility and nutrition count. In irrigation farmer have to keep time table for irrigation which changes as per crop, soil and weather. Web based intelligent drip irrigation system is one and only solution to water management and precision agriculture. In web based system we can control <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> using solenoid <b>valve.</b> This whole system is micro control based and can be operated from remote location through web based so {{there is no need to}} concern about irrigation timing as per crop or soil condition. Sensor is used to take sensor reading of soil like soil moisture, temperature, air moisture and light micro controller take decision control by user (farmer). Web based intelligent irrigation system helps a farmer to take decision on water management in farm and there is no need to maintain irrigation time table.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} a greenhouse at the Department of Biological Sciences, University of Zimbabwe to test the use of various plant water status indicators {{for use in the}} irrigation scheduling and water stress detection of a greenhouse tomato crop. These indicators included midday leaf water potential (LWPmidday), leaf temperature, stem diameter, fruit diameter, stomatal resistance and sap flow. Two replicated treatments were used for the experiment namely a well watered treatment in which plants were always given sufficient water (â€˜sufficientâ€™ being based on calculations of water requirements made using the FAO-Penman-Monteith equation), and a drought stressed treatment in which plants were periodically subjected to drought stress by turning off their <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>valves</b> for a number of days. The procedure was to monitor the variation of these indicators with time for the 60 days of the experiment in both treatments (and their replicates) and correlate these indicators to plant water requirements calculated using the FAO-Penman-Monteith equation. Also twice during the 60 day period of the experiment the drought stressed treatment (and its replicate) were subjected to the drought stress mentioned earlier and the physiological responses noted. In terms of determining irrigation quantity, sap flow and daily mean leaf temperature showed the highest correlations with ETo (R 2 = 0. 64), these were followed by daily maximum leaf temperature and maximum daily stem shrinkage (MDS) with R 2 values of 0. 454 and 0. 401, respectively. Daily fruit growth was a distant fifth (R 2 = 0. 221) with stomatal resistance and leaf water potential being found to have no value in determining irrigation quantity of greenhouse grown tomatoes in this case. In terms of stress detection and irrigation timing, LWPmidday showed the best and quickest response (â‰ˆ 2 days) with sap flow (â‰ˆ 3 days) and leaf to air temperature difference (â‰ˆ 4 days) being second and third, respectively. For LWPmidday it was possible to define a threshold of â‰¤- 1600 kPa while for leaf temperature a threshold for leaf-air temperature difference between the time of 3 : 00 pm and 4 : 45 pm of â‰¥- 2 Â°C was determined at which point plants require water urgently. Stem diameter fluctuations and fruit growth showed some value in terms of monitoring growth rates in a commercial setting. However, they had little value in drought stress detection mainly because of the difficulty in coming up with defined thresholds at which water stress is said to be occurring. Stomatal resistance showed good response to drought stress but suffers due to its reliance on other environmental parameters. However, it was found that stomatal resistance is higher in water stressed plants, and in severely stressed plants will increase with increasing solar radiation; possibly as a defense mechanism to reduce transpiration. LWPmidday showed promise for future research on irrigation scheduling and stress detection. However, the need for commercially operational and possibly automated systems points to the use of sap flow, leaf temperature and MDS in irrigation scheduling and stress detection of greenhouse crops. Future experiments or operational tests should include an experimental phase for data collection followed by a validation phase in which the indicators and the results obtained from them are used in operational automated systems and compared against each other...|$|R
