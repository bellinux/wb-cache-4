5|$|Tudor Arghezi {{dedicated}} Bogdan-Pitești some of {{his first}} poetry writings. As art critics, Arghezi and Theodor Cornel published a comprehensive biographical study on their patron (part of their Figuri contimporane din România dictionary, 1909). However, according to Corina Teacă, the encomium-like and conveniently imprecise entry may have been sent in, or at least approved of, by Bogdan-Pitești. Arghezi also made his sponsor the hero of a small eponymous poem, wherein he is called Lombard bastard cu ochi de rouă ("bastard Lombard <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> of dew").|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{structures}} of the inner and middle ear, which develop from pharyngeal pouches, the ear canal originates from the dorsal portion of the first pharyngeal cleft. It is fully expanded {{by the end of}} the 18th week of development. The eardrum is made up of three layers (ectoderm, endoderm and connective tissue). The pinna originates as a fusion of six hillocks. The first three hillocks are derived from the lower part of the first pharyngeal arch and form the tragus, crus of the helix, and helix, respectively. The final three hillocks are derived from the upper part of the second pharyngeal arch and form the antihelix, antitragus, and earlobe. The outer ears develop in the lower neck. As the mandible forms they move towards their final position level <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E

5|$|Short-term {{exposure}} to zirconium powder can cause irritation, but only contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> requires medical attention. Persistent {{exposure to}} zirconium tetrachloride results in increased mortality in rats and guinea pigs and {{a decrease of}} blood hemoglobin and red blood cells in dogs. However, {{in a study of}} 20 rats given a standard diet containing ~4% zirconium oxide, there were no adverse effects on growth rate, blood and urine parameters, or mortality. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for zirconium exposure is 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) is 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short term limit of 10mg/m3. At levels of 25mg/m3, zirconium is immediately dangerous to life and health. However, zirconium is not considered an industrial health hazard. Furthermore, reports of zirconium-related adverse reactions are rare and, in general, rigorous cause-and-effect relationships have not been established. No evidence has been validated that zirconium is carcinogenic or genotoxic.|$|E
25|$|SnF2 {{can cause}} redness and {{irritation}} if inhaled or comes into contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes.</b> At acute levels (over 2mg/m3), if ingested, {{it can cause}} abdominal pains and shock.

When used in dental products, mild tooth discoloration may also occur; this can be removed by brushing.|$|E
25|$|According to Henry, {{life can}} never {{be seen from the}} exterior, as it never appears in the exteriority of the world.

25|$|Motion {{sickness}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} prominent symptoms of vertigo and develops most often in persons with inner ear problems. The feeling of dizziness and lightheadedness is often accompanied by nystagmus (an involuntary movement of the eye characterized by a smooth pursuit eye movement followed by a rapid saccade in the opposite direction of the smooth pursuit eye movement). During a single episode of vertigo, this action will occur repeatedly. Symptoms can fade while sitting still <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> closed.|$|E

25|$|The first {{symptoms}} of acute arsenic {{poisoning by ingestion}} are digestive problems: vomiting, abdominal pains, diarrhea often accompanied by bleeding. Sub-lethal doses can lead to convulsions, cardiovascular problems, inflammation of the liver and kidneys and abnormalities in the coagulation of the blood. These are followed {{by the appearance of}} characteristic white lines (Mees' lines) on the nails and by hair loss. Lower doses lead to liver and kidney problems and to changes in the pigmentation of the skin.

25|$|The {{independence}} of Indonesia, which saw more than 150,000 Dutch troops stationed there as decolonization force, {{was regarded as}} an economic disaster for the Netherlands. With the certain loss of the prized colony, the queen announced her intention to abdicate, doing so on 4 September 1948. Two days later, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> of the world upon her, Juliana was sworn-in and inaugurated as monarch during {{a joint session of}} the States General at a ceremony held in the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam, becoming the 12th member of the House of Orange to rule the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|Gestation {{is usually}} between 50 and 52 days, {{although}} there have been 62- and 63-day gestation periods reported from foxes in captivity. The typical litter is between one and four kits, with weaning taking place at around 61 to 70 days. When born, the kit's ears are folded over and its eyes are closed, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> opening at around ten days and the ears lifting soon afterward. The life span of a fennec fox has been recorded as up to 14 years in captivity.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{diseases}} {{that result in}} vertigo are {{benign paroxysmal positional vertigo}} (BPPV), Ménière's disease, and labyrinthitis. Less common causes include stroke, brain tumors, brain injury, multiple sclerosis, migraines, trauma, and uneven pressures between the middle ears. Physiologic vertigo may occur following being exposed to motion for a prolonged period such as when on a ship or simply following spinning <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> closed. Other causes may include toxin exposures such as to carbon monoxide, alcohol, or aspirin. Vertigo is a problem {{in a part of the}} vestibular system.
