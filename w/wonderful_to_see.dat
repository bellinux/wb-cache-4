They carry with them the esteem and affection of the townspeople, {{who have come to}} appreciate their rare qualities. Before her departure, Mrs. Adelina Türr insisted upon visiting the orphanages, where the children greeted her with a most abundant dose of confetti. It was <b>wonderful</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> this scion of one of the greatest and most powerful families of Europe caress and kiss the sons of our labourers, and make the effort of conversing with them in their Pallanzese dialect.|$|E

David Sims of The Atlantic felt he was [...] "smarmily funny, somehow simultaneously magnetic and repulsive; after years wandering the halls of mediocre art cinema, it’s <b>wonderful</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him cut loose again." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said: [...] "Gosling, a virtuoso of verbal sleaze, talks directly to the camera, and he's volcanically fierce and funny." [...] Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly felt he [...] "oozes smarm and smartass charm." [...] However, Peter Keogh of the Boston Globe said he was merely [...] "doing a fair imitation of Bradley Cooper." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (released as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in the United States) {{took place in}} 2001. Radcliffe {{received}} a seven figure salary for the lead role, but asserted that the fee was [...] "not that important" [...] to him; his parents chose to invest the money for him. The film was highly popular and was met with positive reviews, and critics took notice of Radcliffe: [...] "Radcliffe is the embodiment of every reader's imagination. It is <b>wonderful</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a young hero who is so scholarly looking and filled with curiosity and who connects with very real emotions, from solemn intelligence and the delight of discovery to deep family longing," [...] wrote Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle.|$|E
500|$|As the wet {{season ended}} in early 1852, Seacole joined other traders in Cruces in packing up {{to move to}} Gorgona. She records a white American giving a speech at a leaving dinner in which he wished that [...] "God bless the best yaller woman he ever made" [...] and asked the {{listeners}} to join with him in rejoicing that [...] "she's so many shades removed from being entirely black". He {{went on to say}} that [...] "if we could bleach her by any means we would and thus make her acceptable in any company as she deserves to be". Seacole replied firmly that she did not [...] "appreciate your friend's kind wishes with respect to my complexion. If it had been as dark as any nigger's, I should have been just as happy and just as useful, and as much respected by those whose respect I value." [...] She declined the offer of [...] "bleaching" [...] and drank [...] "to you and the general reformation of American manners". Salih notes the use of American pidgin, against Seacole's clear English, as representational of a supposed white moral and intellectual superiority. Seacole also comments on the positions of responsibility taken on by escaped American slaves in Panama, as well as in the priesthood, the army, and public offices, commenting that [...] "it is <b>wonderful</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how freedom and equality elevate men". She also records an antipathy between Panamanians and Americans, which she attributes in part to the fact that so many of the former had once been slaves of the latter.|$|E

500|$|During September 2008, Ferraro gained {{attention}} {{yet again}} after the announcement of Sarah Palin as the Republican vice-presidential nominee, the first such major party bid for a woman since her own in 1984. Palin mentioned Ferraro as well as Clinton as forerunners in her introductory appearance. In reaction to the nomination, Ferraro said, [...] "It's great to be the first, but I don't {{want to be the}} only. And so now it is <b>wonderful</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a woman on a national ticket." [...] Ferraro speculated that the pick might win Republican presidential nominee John McCain the election, but said that she was supporting Obama now due to his running mate selection of Joe Biden having resolved her concerns about Obama's lack of experience in certain areas. Ferraro criticized the media's scrutiny of Palin's background and family as gender-based and saw parallels with how she was treated by the media during her own run; a University of Alabama study also found that media framing of Ferraro and Palin was similar and often revolved around their nominations being political gambles. A Newsweek cover story detected a change in how women voters responded to a female vice presidential candidate from Ferraro's time to Palin's, but Ferraro correctly predicted that the bounce that McCain received from the Palin pick would dissipate. In a friendly joint retrospective of her 1984 debate with George H. W. Bush, Ferraro said she had had more national issues experience in 1984 than Palin did now, but that it was important that Palin make a good showing in her vice presidential debate so that [...] "little girls [...] see someone there who can stand toe to toe with [...]" [...] McCain and Palin ended up losing, but regardless of the 1984 or 2008 election result, Ferraro said that [...] "Every time a woman runs, women win." [...] Ferraro made a joint appearance with Palin on Fox News during the network's election-night coverage of the 2010 midterms.|$|E

2500|$|In a poll held by E! Online {{columnist}} Kristin Dos Santos {{after the}} series premiere, 60% of participants voted Glau their favorite series regular. Her performance has been praised {{as one of}} the show's best elements, with The Star-Ledger commenting, [...] "if there's a reason to stick with 'Sarah Connor,' it's Glau," [...] and Zap2it.com exclaiming that Glau was [...] "the stand-out in early episodes". IGN also praised Glau's performance of the human character Allison Young in season two, writing, [...] "This episode would never have worked if Summer Glau was not as good as she is ... Glau [...] terrific as the flesh and blood Allison, and it's <b>wonderful</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her display unbridled emotion..." [...] However, Mark Wilson of About.com called Glau [...] "infinitely [...] " [...] and wrote, [...] "I know robots are supposed to be emotionally muted, but Glau's character comes across as lobotomized." [...] In another negative review, Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that Glau [...] "looks like a teenage Ally McBeal" [...] who might [...] "get her teeth punched in by wispy Willow from Buffy the Vampire Slayer.|$|E

2500|$|Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican {{associated}} with the Tea Party movement, questioned her repeatedly on a different aspect, whether Ambassador to the UN Rice had misled the public after the attacks. This line drew the fieriest response from Clinton, who with voice raised and fists shaking, responded, [...] "With all due respect, {{the fact is we}} had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they'd go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and {{do everything we can to}} prevent it from ever happening again, senator." [...] Other Republicans also attacked Clinton, with Representative Jeff Duncan accusing her of [...] "national security malpractice" [...] and Senator Rand Paul saying that the president should have dismissed her from her job for having failed to read security-related cables coming into the State Department (she had said there are over a million cables that come into the department and they are all formally addressed to her). Senator John McCain said that while [...] "It's <b>wonderful</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you in good health and as combative as ever", he was unsatisfied with her answers.|$|E
2500|$|Magennis has {{had several}} {{memorials}} erected in his honour. When Magennis first won the VC, {{he was treated}} rather shabbily by the Unionist-dominated Belfast City Council because he was from a working class Roman Catholic family. Although the public collected £3,600 in appreciation of his heroism, the council refused {{to give him the}} freedom of the city. The only official recognition was a small photograph tucked away in the robing room of the council chamber. The first memorial was only erected in 1999 after a long campaign by his biographer George Fleming and Major S.H. Pollock CD (Canada). The memorial, a bronze and stone statue, was officially unveiled in Belfast on 8 October 1999. The ceremony was conducted in the grounds of Belfast City Hall in the presence of Magennis's son Paul, by the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Bob Stoker. Magennis's former commanding officer, Ian Fraser, was reported as saying: [...] "Jim gave me bother from time to time. He liked his tot of rum, but he was a lovely man and a fine diver. I have never met a braver man. It was a privilege to know him and it's <b>wonderful</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Belfast honour him at last." [...] A wall mural commemorating James Magennis on the 60th anniversary of VJ day was unveiled on 16 September 2005 by Peter Robinson, the Democratic Unionist Party Member of Parliament representing East Belfast, including Tullycarnet.|$|E

Mr. White told her that she was a little fool to have expected anything from a young swell; her brother said she might have known that it was absurd to expect that any one could look at her when Miss Franceska was by; and Mrs. White observed that it was <b>wonderful</b> <b>to</b> her <b>to</b> <b>see</b> so little respect shown for maiden dignity, as to endure to manifest disappointment.
