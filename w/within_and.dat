The politicalisation of the club drew criticism from several club members who accused Laporta of alienating Barcelona fans, both <b>within</b> <b>and</b> outside of Catalunya. By 2003 Barcelona had 1,200 penyes around the world, causing other Spanish clubs to copy the concept. With each individual peña (Castillian Spanish spelling) having different names and rules, it has become a custom in Spain to name a new peña after their favourite player or match, and in turn the player usually attends to the inaugural supper.|$|E
