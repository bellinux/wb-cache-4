50|$|Other gold-aluminium {{intermetallics}} {{can cause}} problems as well. Below 624°C, purple plague {{is replaced by}} Au2Al, a tan-colored substance. It is a poor conductor and can cause electrical failure of the joint {{that can lead to}} mechanical failure. At lower temperatures, about 400 - 450°C, an interdiffusion process takes place at the junction. This leads to formation of layers of several intermetallic compounds with different compositions, from gold-rich to aluminium-rich, with different growth rates. Cavities form as the denser, faster-growing layers consume the slower-growing ones. This process, known as Kirkendall voiding, leads to both increased electrical resistance and mechanical weakening of the <b>wire</b> <b>bond.</b> When the voids are collected along the diffusion front, a process aided by contaminants present in the lattice, it is known as Horsting voiding, a process similar to and often confused with Kirkendall voiding.|$|E
