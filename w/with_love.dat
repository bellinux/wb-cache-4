5|$|Fleming's {{novels and}} early screen adaptations {{presented}} minimal {{equipment such as}} the booby-trapped attaché case in From Russia <b>with</b> <b>Love,</b> although this situation changed dramatically with the films. However, {{the effects of the}} two Eon-produced Bond films Dr. No and From Russia <b>with</b> <b>Love</b> had an effect on the novel The Man with the Golden Gun, through the increased number of devices used in Fleming's final story.|$|E
5|$|From Russia, <b>with</b> <b>Love</b> {{received}} broadly positive reviews at {{the time}} of publication. The book's sales were boosted by an advertising campaign that played upon a visit by the British Prime Minister Anthony Eden to Fleming's Goldeneye estate, and the publication of an article in Life, which listed From Russia, <b>with</b> <b>Love</b> as one of US President John F. Kennedy's ten favourite books. The story was serialised in the Daily Express newspaper, first in an abridged, multi-part form and then as a comic strip. In 1963 it was adapted into the second film in the Bond series, starring Sean Connery.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 Time Out polled several film critics, directors, {{actors and}} stunt actors to list their top action films; From Russia <b>With</b> <b>Love</b> was listed at 69.|$|E

5|$|Although Fleming did not {{date the}} event within his novels, John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both of whom wrote books for Ian Fleming Publications—have {{identified}} different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole. Chancellor put {{the events of}} From Russia, <b>with</b> <b>Love</b> in 1955; Griswold is more precise, and considers the story {{to have taken place}} between June and August 1954.|$|E
5|$|Desmond Llewelyn as Q: The head of Q-Branch, he {{supplies}} 007 with {{a modified}} Aston Martin DB5. Hamilton told Llewelyn to inject humour into the character, thus beginning the friendly antagonism between Q and Bond {{that became a}} hallmark of the series. He had already appeared in the previous Bond film From Russia <b>With</b> <b>Love</b> and, with the exception of Live and Let Die, would continue to play Q in the next 16 Bond films.|$|E
5|$|Eon again {{turned to}} Richard Maibaum for the script, {{although}} Paul Dehn was later introduced for rewrites. After missing From Russia <b>with</b> <b>Love,</b> Ken Adam returned as production designer. Adam's imagination provided {{the idea of}} gold stacked upon gold behind iron bars for the scenes in the United States Bullion Depository. Saltzman disliked the design's resemblance to a prison, but Hamilton liked it enough that it was built.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{financial}} success of Dr. No, United Artists greenlit a second James Bond film. The studio doubled the budget offered to Eon Productions with $2 million, and also approved {{a bonus for}} Sean Connery, who would receive $100,000 along with his $54,000 salary. As President John F. Kennedy had named Fleming's novel From Russia <b>with</b> <b>Love</b> among his ten favourite books of all time in Life magazine, producers Broccoli and Saltzman chose this as the follow-up to Bond's cinematic debut in Dr. No. From Russia <b>with</b> <b>Love</b> was the last film President Kennedy saw at the White House on 20 November 1963 before going to Dallas. Most of the crew from the first film returned, with major exceptions being production designer Ken Adam, who {{went to work on}} Dr. Strangelove and was replaced by Dr. Nos art director Syd Cain; title designer Maurice Binder was replaced by Robert Brownjohn, and stunt coordinator Bob Simmons was unavailable and was replaced by Peter Perkins though Simmons performed stunts in the film. John Barry replaced Monty Norman as composer of the soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|For the {{confrontation}} between Bond and Trevelyan inside the antenna cradle, director Campbell {{decided to take}} inspiration from Bond's fight with Red Grant in From Russia <b>with</b> <b>Love.</b> Pierce Brosnan and Sean Bean did all the stunts themselves, except for one take where one is thrown against the wall. Brosnan injured his hand while filming the extending ladder sequence, making producers delay his scenes and film the ones in Severnaya earlier.|$|E
5|$|From Russia <b>with</b> <b>Love</b> was a {{critical}} and commercial success. It took more than $78 million in worldwide box office receipts, far more than its $2 million budget and more than its predecessor Dr. No, thereby becoming a blockbuster in 1960s cinema.|$|E

5|$|From Russia, <b>with</b> <b>Love</b> is {{the fifth}} novel by the English author Ian Fleming to feature his fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond. Fleming wrote the story in early 1956 at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica; {{at the time he}} thought it might be his final Bond book. The novel was first {{published}} in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape on 8 April 1957.|$|E
5|$|From Russia, <b>with</b> <b>Love</b> was {{released}} in the UK as a hardback on 8 April 1957, by the publishers Jonathan Cape. The American edition was published {{a few weeks later}} by Macmillan. In November 1956 the Prime Minister, Sir Anthony Eden, had visited Fleming's Jamaican Goldeneye estate, to recuperate from a breakdown in his health. This was much reported in the British press, and the publication of From Russia, <b>with</b> <b>Love</b> was accompanied by a promotional campaign that capitalised on Fleming's raised public profile. The serialisation of the story in The Daily Express in 1957 provided a boost to the sales of the book; a bigger rise in sales was to follow four years later. In an article in Life on 17 March 1961, the US President John F. Kennedy listed From Russia, <b>with</b> <b>Love</b> as one of his ten favourite books. This accolade, and its associated publicity, led to a surge in sales that made Fleming the biggest-selling crime writer in the US. There was a further boost to sales following the release of the film of the same name in 1963, which saw the sales of the Pan paperback rise from 145,000 in 1962 to 642,000 in 1963 and 600,000 in 1964.|$|E
5|$|In 2012 {{the novel}} From Russia, <b>with</b> <b>Love</b> was dramatized for Radio 4; it {{featured}} a full cast again starring Stephens as Bond. In May 2014 Stephens again played Bond, in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, with Alfred Molina as Blofeld, and Joanna Lumley as Irma Bunt.|$|E

5|$|Martin also {{directly}} and indirectly contributed to the main themes of three films in the James Bond series. Although Martin did not produce the theme for the second Bond film, From Russia <b>with</b> <b>Love,</b> {{he was responsible for}} the signing of Matt Monro to EMI, just months prior to his recording of the song of the same title.|$|E

5|$|A further legacy saw {{the sales}} of Fleming's novels rise sharply {{after the release of}} Dr. No and the {{subsequent}} films. In the seven months after Dr. No was released, 1.5 million copies of the novel were sold. Worldwide sales of all the Bond books rose throughout the sixties as Dr. No and the subsequent films – From Russia <b>with</b> <b>Love</b> and Goldfinger – were released: in 1961 500,000 books had been sold, which rose to six million in 1964 and seven million in 1965. Between the years 1962 to 1967, a total of nearly 22.8 million Bond novels were sold.|$|E
40|$|A Fence in the Dark is a {{collection}} of poems that explores the relationship between memory and imagination. The poet blends the literary conventions of poetry, novel, and memoir and explores what it means to <b>love</b> <b>with</b> hate, <b>love</b> <b>with</b> fear, <b>love</b> <b>with</b> desperation, and <b>love</b> <b>with</b> madness. Whether employing the lens of a young girl with no anchor in the world, a ghost and his daughters alone in a swamp, or the quiet isolation of nature, these poems seek to find connection and affection in the face of isolation and hostility. They blend beautiful, quiet images with an undercurrent of violence and challenge the reader???s understanding of beauty. CSU, Chic...|$|R

5|$|After {{recovering}} from serious poisoning inflicted by the SMERSH agent Rosa Klebb (in From Russia, <b>with</b> <b>Love)</b> the MI6 agent James Bond is sent by his superior, M, on an undemanding {{mission to the}} British colony of Jamaica. He is instructed to investigate the disappearance of Commander John Strangways, the head of MI6's Station J in Kingston, and his secretary. Bond is briefed that Strangways had been investigating the activities of Doctor Julius No, a reclusive Chinese-German who lives on the fictional island of Crab Key and runs a guano mine. The island has a colony of roseate spoonbills at one end while local rumour is that a vicious dragon also lives there. The spoonbills are protected by the American National Audubon Society, two of whose representatives died when their plane crashed on No's airstrip.|$|E
5|$|After the {{financial}} success of Dr. No, United Artists doubled the budget offered to Eon Productions to $2 {{million for the}} company's next film, From Russia <b>with</b> <b>Love.</b> The film was shot in Europe, which {{had turned out to}} be the more profitable market for Dr. No. Most of the crew from the first film returned, with major exceptions being production designer Ken Adam—who went to work on Dr. Strangelove and was replaced by Dr. Nos art director Syd Cain—and title designer Maurice Binder, who was replaced by Robert Brownjohn.|$|E

The book is a leather bound manuscript decorated with Rhodochrosite (A precious stone) and a silver skull. The copy does have a note by Rowling to Mr. Cunningham as follows “To Barry, the man who thought an overlong novel about a boy wizard in glasses might just sell … THANK YOU.” She has also added a note about the stone as “traditionally associated <b>with</b> <b>love,</b> balance and joy in daily life”.|$|E
