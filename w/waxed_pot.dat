50|$|The nest {{consists}} of inner brood cells {{and a short}} entrance tube. The brood cells are sometimes compacted into combs and large <b>wax</b> <b>pots</b> for storage of honey/pollen. The cells are composed of cerumen, are vertical in shape, and open {{at the top of}} the cell. The entrance to the nest has an average cross-sectional area of 143.5 mm2 and is guarded by about 8 guards. These bees stand at attention near the entrance, occasionally flying back and forth in front of the entrance.|$|R
40|$|In an 11 -week {{greenhouse}} study, caged queenright {{colonies of}} Bombus impatiens Cresson, were fed treatments of 0 (0 ppb actual residue I, imidacloprid; C, clothianidin), 10 (14 I, 9 C), 20 (16 I, 17 C), 50 (71 I, 39 C) and 100 (127 I, 76 C) ppb imidacloprid or clothianidin in sugar syrup (50 %). These treatments overlapped the residue levels found in pollen and nectar of many crops and landscape plants, which have higher residue levels than seed-treated crops (less than 10 ppb, corn, canola and sunflower). At 6 weeks, queen mortality {{was significantly higher}} in 50 ppb and 100 ppb and by 11 weeks in 20 ppb- 100 ppb neonicotinyl-treated colonies. The largest impact for both neonicotinyls starting at 20 (16 I, 17 C) ppb was the statistically significant reduction in queen survival (37 % I, 56 % C) ppb, worker movement, colony consumption, and colony weight compared to 0 ppb treatments. Bees at feeders flew back to the nest box so it appears {{that only a few}} workers were collecting syrup in the flight box and returning the syrup to the nest. The majority of the workers sat immobilized for weeks {{on the floor of the}} flight box without moving to fed at sugar syrup feeders. Neonicotinyl residues were lower in <b>wax</b> <b>pots</b> in the nest than in the sugar syrup that was provided. At 10 (14) ppb I and 50 (39) ppb C, fewer males were produced by the workers, but queens continued to invest in queen production which was similar among treatments. Feeding on imidacloprid and clothianidin can cause changes in behavior (reduced worker movement, consumption, <b>wax</b> <b>pot</b> production, and nectar storage) that result in detrimental effects on colonies (queen survival and colony weight). Wild bumblebees depending on foraging workers can be negatively impacted by chronic neonicotinyl exposure at 20 ppb...|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis July 2013. Major: Entomology. Advisor: Dr. Vera Krischik. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 58 pages, appendices p. 53 - 58. The 20 year research focus on residue levels below 10 ppb of neonicotinyl insecticides found in nectar and pollen of seed-treated crops (corn, canola, and sunflower) has not demonstrated {{a reduction in}} bee colony health in most field studies. However, the label rate of neonicotinyl use on crops and landscape plants {{is much higher than}} seed treatments. In addition, crops and flowers can be retreated multiple times a season which can contribute to chronic exposure to bees at higher residue levels. In an 11 week greenhouse cage study with queenright colonies of Bombus impatiens Cresson, provided 0, 10, 20, 50 and 100 ppb imidacloprid or clothianidin in sugar syrup, neither neonicotinyl reduced production of brood, workers, and queens. Male production decreased in 10 - 100 ppb imidacloprid and 50 - 100 ppb clothianidin treatments. However, starting at 6 weeks queen mortality was significantly higher in 20 - 100 ppb imidacloprid or clothinaidin. The largest impact was the reduction in worker movement, consumption, number of syrup filled <b>wax</b> <b>pots,</b> and the addition of wax to the colony, which resulted in reduced colony weight. Queens and nest bees fed on the sugar syrup stored in <b>wax</b> <b>pots</b> that were filled {{prior to the start of}} the experiment. Foraging bees did not return sugar syrup to the nest, but remained on the floor of the flight box. We argue that queen mortality at 20, 50, and 100 ppb was related to lack of syrup in storage pots. We speculate that as queens started to die at week 6, workers in 20 - 100 ppb treatments produced fewer males and instead provisioned cells to produce new queens, since queen production was not reduced at higher doses, but male production was reduced. Since neonicotinyls in this and other studies were shown to reduce food consumption and foraging, wild bumblebee colonies that depend on workers to forage will be negatively affected by exposure to imidacloprid above 20 ppb. Solitary bees will be greatly impacted as the foraging queens solely provision the larvae...|$|R
5000|$|The Firebird is {{the first}} Gibson solid-body to use neck-through construction, wherein the neck {{extended}} to {{the tail end of}} the body. The neck itself is made up of five plies of mahogany interspersed with four narrow strips of walnut for added strength. Other features were reverse headstock (with the tuners on the treble side) and [...] "banjo"-style planetary geared tuning keys. The special original Gibson Firebird humbucking pickup(s) - single, dual or triple - were smaller footprint versions of standard Gibson humbucking pickups, but were unique in that inside each of their smaller bobbins contained an AlNiCo bar magnet (standard humbucking pickups AND mini-humbucking pickups have one bar magnet that activates the 6 iron slug poles of one bobbin, and 6 iron screw poles of the other bobbin). Original Firebird pickups were also built without any specific bobbin fasteners - their bobbins (and possible [...] "reflector" [...] plate under the bobbins) were held onto the frame during both the <b>wax</b> <b>potting</b> process (to reduce/eliminate feedback and unwanted noise) and the solid metal cover that was soldered to the frame base. There are no screw poles on Firebird pickups. Some Firebirds from 1965 featured Gibson's single-coil P-90 pickup.|$|R
50|$|A {{batch of}} ten ESBV {{carriages}} {{were built in}} 1909-1910, generally to the standard E design but with around half the carriage devoted to mail sorting for use on express trains on runs such as Melbourne to Bendigo, among others. The cars had two seats at one end opposite the male lavatory, one smoking, three standard and one ladies' compartment for a total seating capacity of 41 passengers; the latter compartment had {{direct access to the}} ladies' lavatory from within the compartment at the expense of one seat. The ladies lavatory was directly opposite a staff lavatory which joined onto the staff-only mail sorting compartment, which was a little under 30 feet long. This compartment contained a sorting desk with a pintsch-gas heated <b>wax</b> <b>pot</b> (for letter sealing), a cupboard, four seats and thirty-four pigeon holes on one side, and a framework for storage of sixty mail bags on the other. Besides the inter-carriage diaphragms the mail sorting compartment was only accessible by a sliding door {{on each side of the}} carriage, much like those on DVE vans. ESBV 6 through 10 were slightly different internally compared to ESBV 1 through 5 - if looking from the mail sorting area towards the passenger area the corridor would have been on the right, rather than the left as in the first five cars.|$|R
5000|$|V5 - In 2000 Squier made an {{exclusive}} run of six string Stagemasters for Mars Music. They came in HH configuration only and {{were available in}} three colors: Blueburst, Redburst, and Blackburst. Notable difference is the regular headstock that is not reversed {{like all the other}} Stagemasters. These came with a bolt on 24 fret neck, Licensed Floyd Rose tremolo bridge with a locking nut, black hardware, one vol/one tone knob, and a 3-way knife switch. These are known as the [...] "Mars Stagemasters". The 2nd generation 24-fret Solid Body Stagemaster featured many upgrades and was [...] "designed to compete with guitars costing 4 to 5 times as much." [...] One upgrade was <b>wax</b> <b>potted</b> pickups stock with the guitar. Another upgrade was rear-mounted electronics allowing for a guitar without pickguards. The Deluxe model featured neck-through three-piece maple necks, while the standard models featured a bolt-on one-piece neck with no scarf joint with the contoured heel. The reverse headstocks on the Stagemasters allow for completely straight string pull. Another nice feature is the inclusion of a brass bridge sustain block on the licensed Floyd Rose bridge, unusual quality in a budget-priced guitar. In 2002 the Stagemaster was renamed to Showmaster due to a trademark claim from Kramer, who made a guitar called the Stagemaster in the mid-late 1980's. V3 and V4 model Stagemaster guitars are known to exist labelled as [...] "Showmaster".|$|R

50|$|Bombus pensylvanicus {{maintains}} a reproductive cycle that it {{similar to other}} species of bumblebee. Environmental factors as well as accessibility of resources affects the cyclic advancement of the colony. The cycle begins in February and ends around November or December. Female bees can yield eggs {{without the need for}} mating, a process known as haplodiploidy. Unfertilized eggs develop into males, whereas fertilized eggs develop into female workers or queen bees. The reproductive cycle begins in July/August, when a male mates with a freshly hatched queen. The fertilized queen stays in hibernation until spring of the next year, waiting for the optimal conditions to search for a nest. In March, the queen bee gathers pollen and nectar, as a source of nutrition and to build a <b>wax</b> <b>pot,</b> and establishes her colony. These colonies most likely arrange and initiate in February. Female workers develop through the pollen collected as it stimulates the ovaries to create eggs, which are fertilized from the males of year before. The queen continues to warm the eggs initially, then the eggs continue their life cycle of development: first larval stage, then pupae, and lastly adult female workers. The female workers care for the nest and eggs, whereas the queen lays eggs. This process of egg to adult bee takes about 4-5 weeks.Initial workers forage and increase the colony size by bringing resources for growth. Thus, workers that hatch later in the year, around midsummer, tend to be larger than initial worker bees. The hives continue to grow, and in late summer there can be more than 200 worker bees. At the point when the size of the hive is sufficient, the queen stops production of a chemical that prevents ovarian production of certain females leading to specify the production of queen bee eggs and male eggs.Certain female workers may produce their own eggs, but the queen will usually get rid of them. The constant battle between the queen and workers continue until late summer when the workers sting the queen to death. The cycle begins again in the winter as the queen bee eggs hatch and the worker bees die.|$|R
50|$|A C. pallida female {{will find}} a spot for her nest. She will then dig diagonally down about 12 in. At {{the end of this}} tunnel, she will dig an 1 in long {{vertical}} chamber where the egg will be laid. The chamber will be about 8 in below the surface. In this chamber, the female will form a brood <b>pot</b> lined with <b>wax.</b> The brood <b>pot</b> will contain nectar and pollen similar to the bee bread in other bees; however, unlike other bees, the bee bread is the consistency of molasses instead of being solid. The egg is laid on top of the bee bread and sealed in with wax, and the tunnel is partially filled with dirt to protect the egg. A female can create several of the burrows during her lifetime.|$|R
40|$|The ability use {{vibrational}} {{signals to}} activate nestmate foraging {{is found in}} the highly social bees, stingless bees and honey bees, and has been hypothesized to exist in the closely related, primitively eusocial bumble bees. We provide the first strong and direct evidence that this is correct. Inside the nest, bumble bee foragers produce brief bursts of vibration (foraging activation pulses) at 594. 5 Hz for 63 ± 26 ms (velocityRMS= 0. 46 ± 0. 02 mm/s, forceRMS= 0. 8 ± 0. 2 mN. Production of these vibrations significantly increased by 1. 5 fold inside the nest when a forager successfully returned with artificial nectar (2. 5 M sucrose solution) and the number of foragers exiting and entering the colony into a foraging arena significantly increased by 1. 8 fold and 1. 8 fold respectively as compared to when the colony was offered water. The nest is well suited to transmitting these vibrations, and the <b>wax</b> food <b>pots</b> and brood cells exhibit a transmission resonance at 300 - 700 Hz (1. 9 - 2. 3 fold increase in dB relative to other frequencies from 10 Hz to 10 kHz). Playbacks of foraging activation pulses at natural amplitudes (force= 1 mN, velocity= 0. 4 mm/s) results in a 1. 2 fold increase in bees entering the foraging arenas as compared to playbacks of white noise adjusted to be equal in vibrational amplitude, force, and duty cycle to the natural signals. Thus, vibrational foraging activation signals may be a basal trait shared by primitively eusocial and highly social bee...|$|R
50|$|Male bumblebees, {{also known}} as drones, have a purely {{reproductive}} purpose. In the fall, males and newly hatched queens mate before the weather cools. Each future queen mates only once and stores the sperm {{for the remainder of}} her life, using it to produce all the subsequent female progeny. After mating, young queens hibernate underground until the spring while all the other bees will die. The queens then emerge from hibernation and feed on pollen and nectar until they can lay their first brood of 8 to 10 eggs. Before laying the eggs, they build a nest out of grass and deposit honey into a <b>wax</b> honey <b>pot</b> that she made. They make and deposit honey in the honey pot after collecting enough pollen. Breeding occurs in the summer months. Most workers live for a brief period of time due to the intensity of their work, while queens live for 12 months on average. B. fervidus workers are responsible for making the honey that the queen and developing brood eat. The workers chew pollen and mix it with their saliva to make the honey. Since they need ample pollen for honey, workers {{spend a lot of time}} foraging for nectar and pollen, simultaneously pollinating flowers. When a worker emerges from its cocoon, it will devote most of its time toward developing the brood and consequently building a larger nest out of grass to accommodate the growing colony. If the colony grows too big, then new queens are sometimes killed before it is time for them to mate. Males have a purely reproductive purpose in the nest.|$|R
5000|$|In {{both cases}} {{solution}} {{is affected by}} means of pressure steam in the jacketed portion of the kettle. When the solution is substantially clear it is slowly added, a pail at a time (3 gallons) {{by means of a}} 2 quart dipper, to the heated stearic acid as prepared in 1. The oil burner is kept on during this operation {{in order to keep the}} temperature of the mixture fairly constant at 360 degrees F. Care must be exercised in adding this [...] "Saponifying" [...] solution so that excess foaming is prevented. After all the solution has been added the resulting [...] "formula wax" [...] is heated to 400 degrees F. and maintained at this temperature for four hours, at which time a sample is removed, a congealing point determined, (see under [...] "tests"), and any addition made of stearic acid or sodium carbonate solution for correction, and the mixture held without additional heat for 10 hours. It is then heated again to bring the temperature up to 400 degrees F and allowed to cool gradually, usually overnight. When the temperature has again been reduced to 350 degrees F the wax is pumped by means of a Kinney pump into 10 gallon pails from which the wax is poured into shallow pans containing approximately 50 lbs of the wax per pan. After the material has cooled to room temperature it is removed from the pans and stacked. [...] 3. Into a 200-gallon cast iron cauldron heated by and oil burner of the household type, (or as required at present by war conditions, heated by bituminous coal) are placed 500 to 900 labs of [...] "formula wax". Note: The amount of [...] "formula wax" [...] to make up a batch various according to the amount of scrap wax which is to be added to the cauldron. Scrap wax represents commercial wax of which [...] "formula wax" [...] is a part. To the amount of [...] "formula wax placed in the cauldron are added 19½% Paraffin (133 degrees-135 degrees F., usual source Standard Oil of New Jersey) and 2% stearine pitch (M. P. 40 Degrees Centigrade). This mixture, consisting of [...] "formula wax", paraffin and stearine pitch, represents commercial wax. Finally, commercial scrap wax of the composition given above in added until the total weight of the mixture is approximately 1,600 lbs. This mixture is usually heated beginning at 12 midnight and carried through until the temperature is 410-415 degrees F. at 8 a.m. Note; This may be regarded as standard procedure, although at the present time (Dec., 1943) this has been modified so that only Sunday nights is this done. On other days of the week except Saturday the kettles are started at 6 A.M. This method was adopted due to man shortages which necessitated starting the molding operation later in the day.) At this time a congealing point is taken and the necessary adjustments made (see under [...] "tests") after which the mixture is transferred to a closed agitating tank by means of a Kinney pump, the latter forced the hot material through a 2" [...] pipe. [...] 4. To the mixture in the agitation tank there is added 3/10 percent Johns-Manville # 503 Filter Aid. The temperature is maintained at 375 degrees F. by means of a ring gas burner, at the bottom of the tank. At this temperature the wax is supplied by a Worthington pump at 30 lbs to a one square foot Shriver press whose head and follower are steam jacketed and which has 7 sections. The effluent from this press passes through a second Shriver press which has 2 sections of one square foot each. The mixture from the outlet here finally passes though a 1" [...] pipe which has a 100 × 150 mesh Monel, metal screen held in its cross sections by means of a union, into one of four 75 gallon aluminum kettles[...] These kettles are protected by conical hoods to prevent dust particles being carried into the body of the wax. After allowing the wax to remain at 330 degrees F. for three hours it is ready to be poured into the blank moulds. The temperature is maintained by gas burners beneath the kettles and controlled automatically by Partlow Corp. thermostatic controls. [...] 5. By means of a pot with 2 spouts the moulds are filled with molten <b>wax.</b> The <b>pot</b> has a capacity of about five pounds (slightly less than 2 quarts and is specially designed of aluminum and made by Theodore Walter, Newark N.J... The molding table revolves at the rate of 6 blanks per minute, approximately, and the size of the pouring pot spout is only sufficient to permit the hot wax to flow into the molds at a rate slightly faster than the speed of the molds which rotate past a given point around the table. [...] The blanks are extracted at a temperature of 200-205 degrees F. and place on boards which hold 30 blanks. These boards when filled move by gravity down a conveyor. The length of time on the conveyor is about two hours after which time they are sufficiently cool and hard to be put into production boxes holding 63 blanks. The boxes are placed in racks for the following day's production. Into each production box there is placed a semi-finished cylinder, which has been edged and reamed and which conforms to a standard internal diameter at 70 degrees F of 1.826 [...] " [...] at the thin end. The purpose of this is to permit the edging operation to take place on the un-finished blank at any temperature by adjusting the machine to conform to the standard. Thus, in each production box, there is a total of 63 unfinished cylinders. One day's production is held at least 34 hours before further processing. 6. The blanks are first reamed. The reamer consists of a twisted tapered and eight fluted tool. The blanks are forced on the reamer by hand to a stop. The position of the stop is adjusted so that sufficient material will be removed from both ends of the blanks when the blank is edged in the next operation. The reamer revolves at approximately 300 RPM. 7. The edging operation consists in placing a reamed blank on a tapered mandrel and by means of two special cutters working in unison the ends of the blank are formed to conform in couture to a standard template. A second gauge is used to insure proper length (6⅛"). IN each case the edged blank must rest on a tapered mandrel gauge in exactly the same position as the standard blank which is in the production box. The usual procedure is to make the necessary adjustments of the knives of the first blank which is edged so that is conforms to the standard, and then continue the operation on the rest of the blanks in the production box at the identical position of the first blank. Note; since there are 63 blanks for each standard blank it will be observed that every 63rd cylinder is checked mandrel gauge. The accuracy of the method and the facility with which it is done depend on the care and skill of the operator. This is the most critical of all the operations. The edging machine revolves at 2,200 RPM. 8. Following the edging operation is the stamping. This consists in applying a hot printing die to the thick end of the cylinder as it is placed accurately in a vertical position under the die. The heating of the die is done by means of a resistance wire coiled within a hollow torus near the under edge of the circular die. The coiled wire is connected to a source of current and the latter is adjusted by means of a rheostat. The heated died has raised lettering and makes and impression on the end surface of the wax cylinder. The depressed positive lettering on the cylinder is filled with a thick paste of zinc carbonate, the excess of which is brushed or wiped off after drying. [...] 9. The cylinders are next shaved on a ganged shaving machine consisting of a rough shaving knife free from [...] "blinds" [...] and [...] "lines", accurate concentricity and a minimum of taper. These factors depend on the tension of the driving belt, tension upon the rotating mandrel between centers and the position and sharpness of the knives. The speed of the mandrel is around 2,200 RPM. 10. The finished cylinders are placed in boxes which contain 16 pegs and run down a conveyor. At a point on this conveyor the cylinders are held and brushed on the inside to remove wax shavings and dust. [...] 11. Cylinders are inspected, packed and placed in the stock room for a minimum of thirty days before shipping. [...] 12. The reinforcing liners are made as follows: Crinoline cloth of specifications given under [...] "Tests", are cut into a trapezoid (Paper Products Dept.) base length 6¼, altitude 5⅝" [...] top length 5¾". A pack of these are placed in a vise edgewise and thinned glue, one part Le Pages Glue, one part water, brushed onto one slant edge. A liner is then wrapped a tapered mandrel of such size as to fit no too snugly on the molding core. The liner is held on the mandrel by means of two jaws actuated by a foot lever and the lapped edges of the liner glued by means of a gas iron held for an instant along the line of the lap. J.W.
