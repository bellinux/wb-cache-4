5|$|Ray Fletcher Farquharson MBE (4 August 1897 – 1 June 1965) was a Canadian doctor, {{university}} professor, {{and medical}} researcher. Born in Claude, Ontario, he attended and {{taught at the}} University of Toronto {{for most of his}} life, and was trained and employed at Toronto General Hospital. With co-researcher Arthur Squires, Farquharson was responsible for the discovery of the Farquharson phenomenon, an important principle of endocrinology, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> administering external hormones suppresses the natural production of that hormone.|$|E

I didn't want this to be a recruitment ad or anything jingoistic. The idea of the movie is just for us to trust each other, to cross over barriers of color, sex, beliefs, whatever, and just stick together.|$|E
5|$|Around 1500, the {{innovation}} of the angled bastion {{was developed in}} Italy. With developments such as these, Italy pioneered permanent artillery fortifications, which took over from the defensive role of castles. From this evolved star forts, also known as trace italienne. The elite responsible for castle construction {{had to choose between}} the new type that could withstand cannon fire and the earlier, more elaborate style. The first was ugly and uncomfortable and the latter was less secure, although it did offer greater aesthetic appeal and value as a status symbol. The second choice proved to be more popular as it became apparent that there was little point in trying to make the site genuinely defensible in the face of cannon. For a variety of reasons, not least of <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> many castles have no recorded history, there is no firm number of castles built in the medieval period. However, {{it has been estimated that}} between 75,000 and 100,000 were built in western Europe; of these around 1,700 were in England and Wales and around 14,000 in German-speaking areas.|$|E

5|$|Wilfrid {{refused to}} be consecrated in Northumbria {{at the hands of}} Anglo-Saxon bishops. Deusdedit had died shortly after Whitby, and as there were no other bishops in Britain whom Wilfrid {{considered}} to have been validly consecrated he travelled to Compiègne, to be consecrated by Agilbert, the Bishop of Paris. During his time in Gaul Wilfrid was exposed to a higher level of ceremony than that practised in Northumbria, one example of <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he was carried to his consecration ceremony on a throne supported by nine bishops.|$|E
5|$|Williams set out {{the case}} against utilitarianism – a consequentialist {{position}} the simplest version of <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> actions are right only insofar as they promote the greatest happiness of the greatest number– in Utilitarianism: For and Against (1973) with J. J. C. Smart. One of the book's thought experiments involves Jim, a botanist doing research in a South American country led by a brutal dictator. Jim finds himself {{in a small town}} facing 20 captured Indian rebels. The captain who has arrested them says that if Jim will kill one, the others will be released in honour of Jim's status as a guest, but if he does not, they will all be killed. Simple act utilitarianism would favour Jim killing one of the men.|$|E
