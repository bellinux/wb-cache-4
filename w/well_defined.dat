5|$|The curve-shortening flow {{has also}} been studied for curves in {{three-dimensional}} Euclidean space.

Curves in space may cross each other or themselves according to this flow, and the flow may lead to singularities in the curves; every singularity is asymptotic to a plane. The curve shortening flow for space curves has been used as a way to define flow past singularities in plane curves.|$|E

5|$|At 0930UTC on August17, {{the center}} of Hurricane Dean passed into the Caribbean Sea through the Saint Lucia Channel between the islands of Martinique and St. Lucia. The {{northern}} eyewall passed over Martinique where a weather station in the island's capital of Fort-de-France reported 13in (33cm) of rainfall. By this time the eyewall had closed, forming a distinct eye, and {{in an environment of}} low wind shear and increasing ocean temperature the hurricane began to intensify rapidly. Hurricane Dean strengthened to a Category3 hurricane by the evening of August17. Satellite imagery showed that a <b>well</b> <b>defined</b> eye and numerous cyclonically curved convective bands remained over the Lesser Antilles. That evening, another reconnaissance aircraft reached the hurricane and discovered that it had strengthened into a Category4 hurricane, and by 0600UTC on August18, Dean reached Category5 intensity {{for the first time with}} 165mph (270km/h) winds. The storm's wind radii increased in all quadrants as the storm grew in both intensity and size. At 0800UTC August18, Hurricane Dean passed directly over NOAA sea buoy 42059 which reported a significant wave height (average size of the largest 33% of waves) of 33ft (10m). On August18, Hurricane Dean developed a double eyewall, indicating that an eyewall replacement cycle was taking place and causing short term fluctuations in intensity as Dean weakened back to a Category4 hurricane. That afternoon the hurricane continued to improve its outflow, and its numerous spiral bands gave it a <b>well</b> <b>defined</b> satellite presentation. Hurricane Dean finished the eyewall replacement cycle early on August19 with some trochiodal wobbles.|$|E

5|$|Charley {{originated}} {{with a large}} swirl of clouds which parted off of {{the west coast of}} Africa on August 9. Lacking deep convection or a <b>well</b> <b>defined</b> center, the wave continued west-northwestward without developing. Ten days later, on August 19, satellite images indicated the disturbance was beginning to rotate cyclonically over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. A reconnaissance aircraft flew into the system the next day. While strong winds were recorded, no circulation center was present. The following morning, a second flight reported that a center had formed, and the disturbance was designated a tropical depression. Initially, the center was disorganized. However, convection over the depression blossomed, mostly concentrated over the northern semicircle. During the evening of August 21, the system was named Tropical Storm Charley.|$|E

However, the eye suddenly became better defined. Based on this, Hernan was {{upgraded to}} a major hurricane. The intensity of Hernan was uncertain, as there was some difference between intensity estimates. Hernan maintained its appearance through the evening and it was stated that the peak intensity of the storm may have been 125mph (205km/h). Overnight, Hernan moved over cooler waters and started to weaken. Although the eye remained <b>well</b> <b>defined,</b> outflow to all the southwestern semicircle became poor.|$|E

However, the intensification was slowed somewhat by the proximity of Iris to the west, whose outflow interfered with that of Humberto. Early on August 24, Humberto strengthened into a Category2 hurricane, finally forming a well-defined eye, as it slowed down and entered a Fujiwhara interaction with Iris. That afternoon, while still moving west-northwest, Humberto reached its peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h), just under Category3 intensity.|$|E

5|$|If {{infinite}} matrices {{are used}} to describe linear maps, then only those matrices can be used all of whose columns have but {{a finite number of}} nonzero entries, for the following reason. For a matrix A to describe a linear map f: V→W, bases for both spaces must have been chosen; recall that by definition this means that every vector in the space can be written uniquely as a (finite) linear combination of basis vectors, so that written as a (column) vectorv of coefficients, only finitely many entries v'i are nonzero. Now the columns of A describe the images by f of individual basis vectors of V in the basis of W, which is only meaningful if these columns have only finitely many nonzero entries. There is no restriction on the rows of A however: in the product A·v there are only finitely many nonzero coefficients of v involved, so every one of its entries, even if it is given as an infinite sum of products, involves only finitely many nonzero terms and is therefore <b>well</b> <b>defined.</b> Moreover, this amounts to forming a linear combination of the columns of A that effectively involves only finitely many of them, whence the result has only finitely many nonzero entries, because each of those columns do. One also sees that products of two matrices of the given type is <b>well</b> <b>defined</b> (provided as usual that the column-index and row-index sets match), is again of the same type, and corresponds to the composition of linear maps.|$|E
