5000|$|<b>Wait</b> <b>lists</b> {{tend to be}} used by {{elite and}} {{selective}} universities as well as second-tier liberal arts colleges who are uncertain about how many students will show up in the fall; for example, Stanford and Yale put 1,000 students on their <b>wait</b> <b>lists</b> and Duke put 3,000 on their <b>wait</b> <b>list,</b> according to one report in 2010. Amherst takes 35 students from the 1,000 students on its <b>wait</b> <b>list.</b> And as a general rule, selective colleges and universities will usually have some form of <b>wait</b> <b>list.</b> Of the students on a <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> at a highly selective school, a fraction may be offered admission before classes begin in late August or September. One report said the fraction of wait-listed students who were eventually offered admission - [...] - as an average of all students <b>wait</b> <b>listed</b> in a given year - [...] - was 30%, but this is an overall average, and the fraction of wait-listed applicants to prestigious universities, who are eventually admitted, is much less. Students who are wait-listed can take steps to improve their chances of admission from a <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> by writing letters of interest and by sending second-semester senior grades. <b>Wait</b> <b>listed</b> students are ranked by the admissions department in terms of overall desirability, based on the college's estimation of admissions criteria, and more highly ranked waitlisted students are offered admission first when spots open; this ranking is not revealed to the public.|$|R

5|$|This {{increase}} in population caused many adverse effects. Municipal Utilities Service, which operated telephone service, {{ran out of}} phone numbers and the <b>waiting</b> <b>list</b> for phone connections stretched to 1,500 entries. Electric demand was so high that the power company advised homeowners to buy generators to cope with frequent brownouts. Home prices skyrocketed—a home that sold for $40,000 in 1974 was purchased for $80,000 in 1975. Home and apartment rentals were correspondingly squeezed upward by the rising prices and the demand from pipeline workers. Two-room log cabins with no plumbing rented for $500 per month. One two-bedroom home housed 45 pipeline workers who shared beds on a rotating schedule for $40 per week.|$|E

40|$|<b>Waiting</b> <b>lists</b> for {{elective}} surgery {{are considered a}} major health policy concern in most countries of the world. The most common reason to explain this phenomenon is that demand exceeds supply. Traditionally, the management of <b>waiting</b> <b>lists</b> {{has been focused on}} timeliness of medical attention. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present a <b>waiting</b> <b>lists</b> management model that includes the concepts of timeliness and justice simultaneously. We designed a prioritization method based solely on medical criteria. We developed a computer software to register patients, to prioritize and monitor the <b>waiting</b> <b>lists.</b> The system was implemented in 2013 and is currently used in all surgical specialties at a public hospital. The results show that timeliness does not suffice to manage the <b>waiting</b> <b>lists</b> for {{elective surgery}}, and therefore it should be complemented with an indicator of justice. Under this management model, hospitals should attempt to balance justice with timeliness of care and prioritize initiatives that improve both indicators at the same time. In addition, we propose using this model to manage the <b>waiting</b> <b>lists</b> of other hospital processes...|$|R
40|$|Background: One {{proposal}} to increase kidney transplantation is to exchange kidneys between pairs of ABO-incompatible (or crossmatch -incompatible) living donors and their recipients. One variation that has greater potential exchanges living donor kidneys for cadaveric donor kidneys (indirect exchanges). A primary concern with indirect exchanges {{is the potential}} to disadvantage blood group O <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> candidates. Using <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> modeling, we examine whether this proposal would disadvantage cadaveric kidney blood group O <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> candidates, and present an approach for minimizing these negative effects. Methods: A probability model estimated the total number and blood type frequencies of donor-recipient pairs that would participate in indirect exchanges. A supply-to-demand model for the cadaveric kidney <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> estimated the mean wait time under different allocation policies and donor selection mechanisms for candidates on the <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> classified according to the candidates' race and blood type. Results: Indirect exchanges will reduce the mean wait time for cadaveric kidney <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> candidates. The mean wait time of blood group O cadaveric kidney <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> candidates increases when the participating living donors self-select and when kidney allocation is determined by efficiency. This is neutralized when the transplant team preferentially selects blood group O living donors and cadaveric kidney allocation is determined by need. Conclusion: Indirect exchange programs will significantly shorten the wait times for cadaveric kidney <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> candidates. The <b>wait</b> times of blood group O candidates will not be affected adversely if blood group O living donors are selected preferentially and if allocation is based on need. ...|$|R
5|$|Between 1986 and 1996, River Oaks Elementary School only {{admitted}} {{magnet school}} students {{from other areas}} of the city. The community was divided between the attendance zones of Wilson Elementary School (opened in 1925), the now closed Will Rogers Elementary School (opened in 1950, closed in summer 2006), and Poe Elementary School. By 1995 River Oaks Elementary {{became one of the most}} prestigious elementary schools in Houston and had a <b>waiting</b> <b>list.</b> By that year several new families had established themselves in River Oaks and many of them were interested in sending their children to public school. In 1995, several River Oaks parents petitioned HISD to re-establish the neighborhood program at River Oaks Elementary School which allows non-magnet students residing in the school's boundaries to attend. Some magnet parents opposed, believing that the River Oaks program would reduce racial diversity at the school. In 1996, HISD added a neighborhood program to the school for grades Kindergarten through 2nd, with grades 3 through 5 phased in over a subsequent three-year period.|$|E

50|$|Colleges mailing out <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> offers {{generally}} advise {{students to}} reserve a spot {{at a college}} they have been accepted to by sending in a deposit, usually several hundred dollars to guarantee that the student will have a place at any college in the fall. Later, if a student is accepted by a college from a <b>wait</b> <b>list,</b> and {{if he or she}} chooses to accept the <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> offer, it usually entails sacrificing that earlier deposit. In the United States, for students applying by regular admission, the month of April is a time when much activity happens; colleges email offers of acceptance and rejection, and students select a college by sending a deposit. In May, after receiving deposits, colleges know how many spots will be open, and will usually begin to offer admission to students on their <b>wait</b> <b>lists</b> as positions become open. Students can be offered admission from the <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> during May and June and throughout the summer.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background With 4. 6 million {{patients}} {{who do not}} have a regular family physician, Canada performs poorly compared to other OECD countries in terms of attachment to a family physician. To address this issue, several provinces have implemented centralized <b>waiting</b> <b>lists</b> to coordinate supply and demand for attachment to a family physician. Although significant resources are invested in these centralized <b>waiting</b> <b>lists,</b> no studies have measured their performance. In this article, we present a performance assessment of centralized <b>waiting</b> <b>lists</b> for unattached patients implemented in Quebec, Canada. Methods We based our approach on the Balanced Scorecard method. A committee of decision-makers, managers, healthcare professionals, and researchers selected five indicators for the performance assessment of centralized <b>waiting</b> <b>lists,</b> including both process and outcome indicators.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{deciding}} {{where to}} undergo coronary-artery bypass grafting, {{the length of}} surgical <b>wait</b> <b>lists</b> is often the only information available to cardiologists and their patients. Our objective was to compare the cumulative incidence for death on the <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> {{according to the length}} of <b>wait</b> <b>lists</b> at the time of registration for the operation. Methods The study cohort included 8966 patients who registered to undergo isolated coronary-artery bypass grafting (82. 4 % men; 71. 9 % semi-urgent; 22. 4 % non-urgent). The patients were categorized according to wait-list clearance time at registration: either " 1 month or less" or "more than 1 month". Cumulative incidence for wait-list death was compared between the groups, and the significance of difference was tested by means of regression models. Results Urgent patients never registered on a <b>wait</b> <b>list</b> with a clearance time of more than 1 month. Semi-urgent patients registered on shorter <b>wait</b> <b>lists</b> more often than non-urgent patients (79. 1 % vs. 44. 7 %). In semi-urgent and non-urgent patients, the observed proportion of wait-list deaths by 52 weeks was lower in category " 1 month or less" than in category "more than 1 month" (0. 8 % [49 deaths] vs. 1. 6 % [39 deaths], P P Conclusion Long <b>wait</b> <b>lists</b> for coronary-artery bypass grafting are associated with increased probability that a patient dies before surgery.
