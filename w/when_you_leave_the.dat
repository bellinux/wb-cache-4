2500|$|Some reviewers {{cited the}} film as groundbreaking. Pauline Kael called the film [...] "one of the most gruesomely terrifying movies ever made – and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> theatre you may wish you could forget the whole horrible experience.... The film's grainy, banal {{seriousness}} works for it – gives it a crude realism". A Film Daily critic commented, [...] "This is a pearl of a horror picture that exhibits all the earmarks of a sleeper." [...] While Roger Ebert criticized the matinée screening, {{he admitted that he}} [...] "admires the movie itself". Critic Rex Reed wrote, [...] "If you want to see what turns a B movie into a classic [...] don't miss Night of the Living Dead. It is unthinkable for anyone seriously interested in horror movies not to see it." ...|$|E

60|$|Thus our {{travellers}} {{passed the}} Swiss frontier. In {{half an hour}} afterwards they were comfortably established at a large and splendid hotel called the Three Kings. The hotel has this name in three languages, English, French, and German, as people speaking those several languages come, in almost equal numbers, to Switzerland. Thus <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> station you may, in your directions to the coachman, say you wish {{to go to the}} Three Kings, or to the Trois Rois, or to the Drei Könige, whichever you please. They all mean the same hotel--the best hotel in Basle.|$|E
60|$|And this {{is where}} the value and {{opportunity}} of the modern novel comes in. So far as I can see, it is the only medium through which we can discuss the great majority of the problems which are being raised in such bristling multitude by our contemporary social development Nearly every one of those problems has at its core a psychological problem, and not merely a psychological problem, but one in which the idea of individuality is an essential factor. Dealing with most of these questions by a rule or a generalisation is like putting a cordon round a jungle full of the most diversified sort of game. The hunting only begins <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> cordon behind you and push into the thickets.|$|E

Miss Hepzibah, by secluding herself from society, has lost all true relation with it, and is, in fact, dead; although she galvanizes herself into a semblance of life, and stands behind her counter, afflicting the world with a greatly-to-be-deprecated scowl. Your poor cousin Clifford is another dead and long-buried person, on whom the governor and council have wrought a necromantic miracle. I should not wonder if he were to crumble away, some morning, after you are gone, and nothing be seen of him more, except a heap of dust. Miss Hepzibah, at any rate, will lose what little flexibility she has. They both exist by you." ...|$|E

40|$|Psst: here’s {{my secret}} wry suspicion. Political theorists are {{allergic}} to facts. They feel entitled to firm beliefs—about state-building, modernization, {{the rise of}} the bourgeoisie, you name it—because they’ve read some fancy theory books. So a lot of theory reads like a conceptual shell game, with various intoxicating abstractions shuffled about. I’m enough of a vulgar pragmatist to think that theory isn’t what <b>you</b> get <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>leave</b> out <b>the</b> facts. So I found Wahrman’s Making of the Modern Self sheer joy, from start to finish. The bottom line first: this is a mustread across the humanities and humanistic social sciences, not something solely of interest to cultural historians of Britain’s long eighteenth century. Wahrman’s thesis—that an “ancien régime of identity” abruptly collapsed {{in the face of the}} American Revolution—is juicy enough to make any political theorist smack her lips. But it’s underwritten with a sensational and fascinating array of nitty-gritty facts. (Mischievously, Wahrman sometimes promises, or threatens? the reader that he has plenty more evidence up his sleeve, but confesses, or boasts? that he didn’t think the reader patient enough to endure hearing about it.) And Wahrman shuttles between big picture and tiny detail with consummate confidence. He may be a “historian,” and I may be a “theorist,” but I wish more theorists did what he does. Indeed he presents himself, fairly, as carrying through a project Charles Taylor sketched in his magisterial Sources of the Self but didn’t even attempt to deliver...|$|R
