5|$|Development of the {{sandwich}} began in 2001 {{in response to}} several major factors. After an overall sales decline of 17% coupled with a profit decline of 29%, Burger King {{held a series of}} consumer tests that showed the company's customer base was looking for a wider variety of options when making purchases. Additional survey results revealed that a lack of newer products was discouraging consumers from visiting the chain. Furthermore, the company was seeking to counter the threat to its sales by newer fast casual restaurants that had begun to bite into sales. By July 2002, the chain had sold nearly fifty million of {{the sandwich}}es, eventually displacing the BK Broiler's initial launch figures as the company's best selling product introduction. The successful introduction of the Chicken Whopper {{was one of the few}} noted positive highlights of the company during negotiations for the sale of Burger King by its owner Diageo to a group of investors led by the TPG Capital; Chicago-based consulting firm Technomic Inc. president Ron Paul was quoted that he was encouraged by recent product changes at Burger King such as the new Chicken Whopper, but he said it's too early to tell whether the changes have been successful. Despite the Chicken Whopper's initial success, just over a year after the Chicken Whopper's introduction enthusiasm for the product was waning; Burger King's largest franchisee, Carrols Corporation, <b>was</b> <b>complaining</b> that the product line was a failure, describing the sandwich as a pedestrian product with a great name. As of November 2013, the Chicken Whopper is the current grilled chicken sandwich sold by Burger King in the Middle East.|$|E

Shortly after the ceremony, The Dictator went on tour, and Harris was given a small role in the play. According to Peters, Barrymore [...] "began to think of his marriage as a 'bus accident. Film critic Hollis Alpert wrote that, {{within a week of}} the wedding, Katherine <b>was</b> <b>complaining</b> that she saw her new husband too infrequently.

500|$|Expectations ran {{high among}} {{supporters}} of a post-liberal, post-Marxist politics, and {{the governing council}} did initiate several projects. [...] For example, a series of [...] "Political Awareness Seminars" [...] attempted to help participants understand and learn to work with their political opponents. [...] In addition, a [...] "Transformation Platform" [...] attempted to synthesize left- and right-wing approaches to dozens of public policy issues. [...] But within three years the Alliance fell apart, unable to establish stable chapters in any major cities. [...] Author Jerome Clark suggests the cause was the Alliance's commitment to consensus-building in all its groups and projects; within months, he notes, one member <b>was</b> <b>complaining</b> that the Alliance {{had turned into a}} [...] "diddler's cult". [...] Another explanation focuses on the failure– or inability– of the hyper-democratic questionnaire process to select an appropriate governing council.|$|E

500|$|Some Poor Law {{authorities}} {{hoped that}} {{payment for the}} work undertaken by the inmates would produce a profit for their workhouses, or at least {{allow them to be}} self-supporting, but whatever small income could be produced never matched the running costs. [...] Eighteenth-century inmates were poorly managed, and lacked either the inclination or skills to compete effectively with free market industries such as spinning and weaving. Some workhouses operated not as places of employment, but as houses of correction, a role similar to that trialled by Buckinghamshire magistrate Matthew Marryott. Between 1714 and 1722 he experimented with using the workhouse as a test of poverty rather than a source of profit, leading to the establishment {{of a large number of}} workhouses for that purpose. Nevertheless, local people became concerned about the competition to their businesses from cheap workhouse labour. As late as 1888, for instance, the Firewood Cutters Protection Association <b>was</b> <b>complaining</b> that the livelihood of its members was being threatened by the cheap firewood on offer from the workhouses in the East End of London.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of his career, Sunday {{probably}} preached to more than one hundred million people face-to-face—and, to the great majority, without electronic amplification. Vast numbers [...] "hit the sawdust trail." [...] Although the usual total given for those who came forward at invitations is an even million, one modern historian estimates the true figure to be closer to 1,250,000. Sunday did not preach to a hundred million different individuals but to many of the same people repeatedly over {{the course of}} a campaign. Before his death, Sunday estimated that he had preached nearly 20,000 sermons, an average of 42 per month from 1896 to 1935. During his heyday, when he was preaching more than twenty times each week, his crowds were often huge. Even in 1923, well into the period of his decline, 479,300 people attended the 79 meetings of the six-week 1923 Columbia, South Carolina, campaign–23 times the white population of Columbia. Nevertheless,"trail hitters" [...] were not necessarily conversions (or even [...] "reconsecrations") to Christianity. Sometimes whole groups of club members came forward en masse at Sunday's prodding. By 1927, Rodeheaver <b>was</b> <b>complaining</b> that Sunday's invitations had become so general that they were meaningless.|$|E
500|$|While Carle Place <b>was</b> <b>complaining</b> {{about the}} {{inability}} to access their section of town, a January 1990 article in The New York Times mentioned that the Court's decision put Westbury alone against the state, then-Governor Mario Cuomo and regional planners, who were worried {{about the safety of}} the roughly 140,000 drivers who used the interchange daily. Local business leaders claimed that Westbury was being selfish in opposing inconvenient construction. Even after the ruling, Strada continued to claim that they wanted to be informed on the impacts of a nearby widening project on the Northern State. NYSDOT officials worried that this would add more bureaucratic levels to getting approval for local road projects and that it could set the project back three years. Officials also {{went out of their way}} to call this a simple [...] "not in my backyard" [...] case. NYSDOT continued to claim that the projects were separate, and filed three years apart, despite the court's ruling that they were similar projects. Cuomo, worried about the safety of drivers, invited Strada to come to Albany to meet with NYSDOT Commissioner Franklin White and State Senator Norman J. Levy to make an agreement. Strada, however, felt that in order to compromise, they would have to continue the original [...] "violation" [...] of not giving a report.|$|E

500|$|In 1678 Clement Clerke {{introduced}} the coal-powered reverberatory furnace, greatly increasing {{the quantity of}} metal extractable from ore. The Mines Royal Act 1689 ended Crown ownership of Cornwall's mines, allowing private investors and local families to begin mining operations. At the same time, the Nine Years' War (1688–97) and the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–14) caused high demand for metals. As a consequence the Midlands, with easy river and canal access to the coal mines of Wales and northern England and to the metal mines of Cornwall, became a major centre for metallurgy. Ore was shipped from Cornwall up the River Severn to smelters in Gloucestershire where it was refined and sold on to the factories surrounding Birmingham. Financiers and entrepreneurs began investing in and reorganising the mines of Cornwall. With a shortage of manual labour in rural and lightly-populated Cornwall, and with a prevalent belief that {{women and children were}} best suited to ore separation (which required dexterity and good observation skills but {{little in the way of}} physical strength), the large-scale recruitment of women and girls to the mines began. It is around this time that the term [...] "bal maiden" [...] appears to have come into common usage, derived from the Old Cornish [...] (mine). A significant proportion of Cornwall's young women quickly became involved in mining; by 1736 the vicar of Ludgvan <b>was</b> <b>complaining</b> that he was unable to hire servants as the young women of the town were [...] "employed about copper".|$|E
500|$|In {{a conference}} call with Billboard, Carey {{revealed}} that she wrote [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)" [...] while her husband, Nick Cannon, was hospitalized receiving medical treatment for mild kidney failure, saying [...] "There's a lot of things you can take from there that can keep you going in a tough situation." [...] Carey also added that the song was written around the time her friend, singer Whitney Houston, had died. [...] "'We were actually in the hospital together when we saw it on TV.' It was important for me to write something that would...help me get through the moment. That’s where ‘Stay triumphant, keep on living’ came from." [...] Carey also expressed why she chosen Ross and Mill, or any hip-hop artist in general on the track, claiming that they are [...] "different" [...] and how she is always experimenting on collaborations with varying and new artists. When asked why she chose not to release a lead single which was dance influenced, Carey explained how she felt regarding the current music scene; [...] "I think it would be incredible if we could bring back the days when R records didn't have to cross over but be massive hits on their own," [...] and that was the reason why {{she did not want to}} conform to what is currently on trend. Additionally, she felt that [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)", potentially, would be able to generate cross-appeal, and not only cater Mainstream Top 40. With specific emphasis on the dance music scene and its popularity, Carey stated that while she was pregnant, the vast majority of music that was being released was dance and electronic music, saying [...] "I was pregnant forever, and I was being tortured day and night by techno music. I <b>was</b> <b>complaining</b> to everyone who was listening. One time I made dinner for L.A. Reid, and we were both sitting there like 'What happened?
