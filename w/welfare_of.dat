Drawing on stated preferences of Dutch company car drivers, we assess the short-run <b>welfare</b> effects <b>of</b> changes in the taxation of the private use of these vehicles. We find that the <b>welfare</b> gain <b>of</b> a marginal increase in the taxation of electric company cars is substantial and even outweighs the marginal tax revenue raised...|$|R

50|$|Among <b>welfare</b> economists <b>of</b> the utilitarist school it {{has been}} the general {{tendency}} to take satisfaction (in some cases, pleasure) as the unit <b>of</b> <b>welfare.</b> If the function <b>of</b> <b>welfare</b> economics is to contribute data which will serve the social philosopher or the statesman in the making <b>of</b> <b>welfare</b> judgements, this tendency leads perhaps, to a hedonistic ethics.|$|R

The second part of the paper studies the <b>welfare</b> consequences <b>of</b> the monetary union.

The third is to develop a synthesis of classical and neoclassical into a modern welfare criterion. This study concludes that A. C.

40|$|The {{dominant}} account <b>of</b> <b>welfare</b> {{in medicine}} is an objective one; <b>welfare</b> consists <b>of</b> certain favoured health states, or in having needs satisfied, or in certain capabilities and functionings. By contrast, I present a subjective account <b>of</b> <b>welfare,</b> suggested initially by LW Sumner and called “authentic happiness”. The adoption {{of such an}} account <b>of</b> <b>welfare</b> within medicine offers several advantages over other subjective and objective accounts, and systematises several intuitions about patient‐centredness and autonomy. Subjective accounts <b>of</b> <b>welfare</b> are unpopular because of their implications for justice and {{the autonomy of the}} healthcare professional. This account <b>of</b> <b>welfare,</b> however, seems to have the resources to resist these criticisms...|$|R

In terms of programs this entailed the introduction of vocational instruction, a doubling of the period of schooling, and a broader concern for the <b>welfare</b> <b>of</b> urban youth.|$|E

40|$|Lucas(1987) {{has shown}} the {{surprising}} result that the <b>welfare</b> cost <b>of</b> business cycles is quite small. Using standard assumptions on preferences and a fully-fledged econometric model we computed the <b>welfare</b> costs <b>of</b> macroeconomic uncertainty for the post-WWII era using the multivariate Beveridge-Nelson decomposition for trends and cycles, which considers not only business-cycle uncertainty but also uncertainty from the stochastic trend in consumption. The post-WWII period is relatively quiet, with the <b>welfare</b> costs <b>of</b> uncertainty being about 0. 9 % of per-capita consumption.
