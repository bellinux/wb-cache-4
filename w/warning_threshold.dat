30|$|In this study, data of {{mottled umber}} moth (Erannis defoliaria) and winter moth (Operophtera brumata) (short MUWM) from North and Central Germany were analysed. These related species usually occur {{together}} (Altenkirch 1981) and periodically defoliate entire oak stands in spring. In this way they weaken their host and act as a predisposition factor for severe damage, such as oak decline (Manion 2003). Therefore MUWM are both important and frequently monitored herbivorous insects in Germany. As both species have a similar biology their combined population density is estimated using glue band catches. The amount of caught female MUWM serves for the calculation of the hazard code. When these codes exceed the <b>warning</b> <b>threshold</b> of one, a potential severe defoliation of the host tree in the following spring is expected (Altenkirch 1966; Altenkirch 1981). Therefore, the hazard code also provides a <b>warning</b> <b>threshold</b> for the forest owner that pest control might be necessary in the coming spring.|$|E
30|$|It has to {{be taken}} into {{consideration}} that the exceedance of the <b>warning</b> <b>threshold</b> is only an indicator for potential severe defoliation in the coming spring, but not every threshold exceedance necessarily leads to defoliation.

40|$|Abstract Background China Centre for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) {{developed}} the China Infectious Disease Automated Alert and Response System (CIDARS) in 2005. The CIDARS {{was used to}} strengthen infectious disease surveillance and aid in the early warning of outbreak. The CIDARS has been integrated into the routine outbreak monitoring efforts of the CDC at all levels in China. Early <b>warning</b> <b>threshold</b> is crucial for outbreak detection in the CIDARS, but CDCs at all level are currently using thresholds recommended by the China CDC, and these recommended thresholds have recognized limitations. Our study therefore seeks to explore an operational method to select the proper early <b>warning</b> <b>threshold</b> according to the epidemic features of local infectious diseases. Methods The data {{used in this study}} were extracted from the web-based Nationwide Notifiable Infectious Diseases Reporting Information System (NIDRIS), and data for infectious disease cases were organized by calendar week (1 – 52) and year (2009 – 2015) in Excel format; Px was calculated using a percentile-based moving window (moving window [5  week* 5  year], x), where x represents one of 12 centiles (0. 40, 0. 45, 0. 50 …. 0. 95). Outbreak signals for the 12 Px were calculated using the moving percentile method (MPM) based on data from the CIDARS. When the outbreak signals generated by the ‘mean +  2 SD’ gold standard were in line with a Px generated outbreak signal for each week during the year of 2014, this Px was then defined as the proper threshold for the infectious disease. Finally, the performance of new selected thresholds for each infectious disease was evaluated by simulated outbreak signals based on 2015 data. Results Six infectious diseases were selected in this study (chickenpox, mumps, hand foot and mouth diseases (HFMD), scarlet fever, influenza and rubella). Proper thresholds for chickenpox (P 75), mumps (P 80), influenza (P 75), rubella (P 45), HFMD (P 75), and scarlet fever (P 80) were identified. The selected proper thresholds for these 6 infectious diseases could detect almost all simulated outbreaks within a shorter time period compared to thresholds recommended by the China CDC. Conclusions It is beneficial to select the proper early <b>warning</b> <b>threshold</b> to detect infectious disease aberrations based on characteristics and epidemic features of local diseases in the CIDARS...|$|E

40|$|According to the United States National Hazard Statistics database, {{flooding}} and flash flooding {{have caused the}} largest number of deaths of any weather-related phenomenon over the last 30 years (Flash Flood Guidance Improvement Team, 2003). Like the storms that cause them, flash floods are very variable and non-linear phenomena in time and space, with the result that understanding and anticipating flash flood genesis is far from straightforward. In the U. S., the Flash Flood Guidance (FFG) estimates the average number of inches of rainfall for given durations required to produce flash flooding in the indicated county. In Europe, flash flood often occurred on small catchments (approximately 100 km 2) and {{it has been shown that}} the spatial variability of rainfall has a great impact on the catchment response (LeLay and Saulnier, 2007). Therefore, in this study, based on the Flash flood Guidance method, rainfall spatial variability information is introduced in the threshold estimation. As for FFG, the threshold is the number of millimeters of rainfall required to produce a discharge higher than the discharge corresponding to the first level (yellow) warning of the French flood warning service (SCHAPI: Service Central d’Hydrométéorologie et d’Appui à la Prévision des Inondations). The indexes δ 1 and δ 2 of Zoccatelli et al. (2010), based on the spatial moments of catchment rainfall are used to characterize the rainfall spatial distribution. Rainfall spatial variability impacts on <b>warning</b> <b>threshold</b> and on hydrological processes are then studied. The spatially distributed hydrological model MARINE (Roux et al., 2011), dedicated to flash flood prediction is forced with synthetic rainfall patterns of different spatial distributions. This allows the determination of a <b>warning</b> <b>threshold</b> diagram: knowing the spatial distribution of the rainfall forecast and therefore the 2 indexes δ 1 and δ 2, the threshold value is read on the diagram. A <b>warning</b> <b>threshold</b> diagram is built for each studied catchment. The proposed methodology is applied on three Mediterranean catchments often submitted to flash floods. The new forecasting method as well as the Flash Flood Guidance method (uniform rainfall threshold) are tested on 25 flash floods events that had occurred on those catchments. Results show a significant impact of rainfall spatial variability. Indeed, it appears that the uniform rainfall threshold (FFG threshold) always overestimates the observed rainfall threshold. The difference between the FFG threshold and the proposed threshold ranges from 8...|$|E

30|$|Moreover, it {{has been}} {{observed}} that the user’s acceptance of warnings provided by advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) is related to the provision time.

This might cause driver’s irritation and rejection of the system. As an example, at the IN-ARTE tests, the system that was tested used the thresholds by the manufacturers, which led to a great number of warnings (1 warning per minute for highways and 2 warnings in urban roads).

This work proposes a novel early warning system for heavy precipitation events in Europe, aimed at detecting extreme rainfall accumulations over short durations and within small-size catchments prone to flash flooding. The system {{is based on the}} recently developed European Precipitation Index based on simulated Climatology (EPIC), which is calculated using COSMO-LEPS ensemble weather forecasts and subsequently fitted with gamma distributions at each time step of the forecast horizon. Probabilistic exceedance of <b>warning</b> <b>thresholds</b> is calculated and alert points are generated whereas potentially extreme events are detected. Comparison of daily runs over 22 months with observed rain-storm events and flash floods in Europe denotes a probability of detection up to 90 %, corresponding to 45 events correctly predicted, with average lead time of 32 hours.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{provides an}} overview of domain specific and more general issues critical to the successful design of auditory warnings for medical devices. Successful design requires a thorough understanding of the unique aspects of the medical environment as well as an appreciation of the varied needs and abilities of the diverse user population (e. g., physicians, nurses, patients, etc.). Auditory warnings in the medical arena should not only assist in event detection but also facilitate diagnosis and treatment. False alarms remain an important concern. Many clinical devices now employ integrated or centralized warning strategies, and standardized auditory tones. With these devices, it is necessary to observe the visual display to mentally discern and prioritize all active warnings. A better approach in some circumstances may be the use of novel information containing warnings (e. g., “earcons ” or encoded auditory displays). Additionally, {{there is a need for}} more “intelligent ” warnings based on patient- and situation-(context) specific information. Adjusting <b>warning</b> <b>thresholds</b> as each patient’s condition evolves would decrease false alarms, mitigate noise pollution, and reduce user’s stress and workload. Regardless, a user-centered HFE design process should be used whereby all proposed auditory warnings are designed in an iterative fashion with continuous user input and evaluation...|$|R
