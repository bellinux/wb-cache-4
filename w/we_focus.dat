Also, the vector spaces are usually required to be over the real or complex numbers, {{in which case the}} vector bundle {{is said to be a}} real or complex vector bundle (respectively). Complex vector bundles can be viewed as real vector bundles with additional structure. In the following, <b>we</b> <b>focus</b> on real vector bundles in the category of topological spaces.|$|E
