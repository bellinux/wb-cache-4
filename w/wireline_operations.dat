50|$|Pipe {{recovery}} {{is a specific}} <b>wireline</b> <b>operation</b> used in {{the oil and gas}} industry, when the drill string becomes stuck downhole. Stuck pipe prevents the drill rig from continuing operations. This results in costly downtime, ranging anywhere from $10,000-1,000,000 per day of downtime, therefore it is critical to resolve the problem as quickly as possible. Pipe {{recovery is}} the process by which the location of the stuck pipe is identified, and the free pipe is separated from the stuck pipe. This allows fishing tools to subsequently be run down hole to latch onto and remove the stuck pipe.|$|R
50|$|Wireline retrievals also {{introduce}} additional risk. If {{the tool}} becomes {{detached from the}} wireline, then it will fall back down the drillstring. This will generally cause severe damage to the tool and the drillstring components in which it seats, and will require the drillstring to be {{pulled out of the}} hole to replace the failed components; this results in a greater total cost than pulling out of the hole in the first place. The wireline gear might also fail to latch onto the tool, or, {{in the case of a}} severe failure, might bring only a portion of the tool to the surface. This would require the drillstring to be pulled out of the hole to replace the failed components, thus making the <b>wireline</b> <b>operation</b> a waste of time.|$|R

50|$|First {{developed}} by Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger in 1927, wireline logs measure formation properties in a well through electrical lines of wire. Different from MWD and mud logs, wireline logs are constant downhole measurements sent through the electrical wireline {{used to help}} geologists, drillers and engineers make real-time decisions about drilling <b>operations.</b> <b>Wireline</b> logs can measure resistivity, conductivity and formation pressure, as well as sonic properties and wellbore dimensions.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} current questions in space science is whether life has ever arisen {{anywhere else in the}} universe. Water is a critical prerequisite for all life-as-we-know-it, thus the possible exploration targets for extraterrestrial life are bodies that have or had copious liquid: Mars, Europa, and Enceladus. Due to the oxidizing nature of Mars' surface, as well as subsurface liquid water reservoirs present on Europa and Enceladus, the search for evidence of existing life must likely focus on subsurface locations, at depths sufficient to support liquid water or retain biologic signatures. To address these questions, an Auto-Gopher sampler has been developed that is a wireline type drill. This drill is suspended on a tether and its motors and mechanisms are built into a tube that ends with a coring bit. The tether provides the mechanical connection to a rover/lander on a surface as well as power and data communication. Upon penetrating to a target depth, the drill is retracted from the borehole, the core is deposited into a sample transfer system, and the drill is lowered back into the hole. <b>Wireline</b> <b>operation</b> sidesteps one of the major drawbacks of traditional continuous drill string systems by obviating the need for multiple drill sections, which add significantly to the mass and the complexity of the system (i. e. penetration rate was 40 cm per hour). Drilling to 2 meter depth and recovering of cores every 10 cm took a total time of 15 hours (a single step of drilling 10 cm and retrieving the core was 45 minutes). Total energy to reach the 2 m depth was 500 Whr. The Weight on Bit was limited to less than 70 Newton. The core recovery was 100 %...|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore TechnologyThe light well {{intervention}} for subsea wells using riserless method {{has been carried}} out extensively over the last 10 years to increase the oil and gas recovery from depleted wells. Riserless Light Well Intervention (RLWI) is a relatively new technology {{that can be used to}} replace the majority of the well interventions previously done from semisubmersible rigs. RLWI performs subsea well intervention without using a drilling riser package and a subsea BOP. Alternatively, the Well Control Package (WCP) will be installed on top of subsea Xmas Tree as a barrier replacing BOP and then downhole tools can be deployed into the subsea well utilizing wireline from intervention vessel. The RLWI method is expected to reduce the cost and time in performing well intervention compared to conventional method. But when it comes to lowering down the downhole tool, it has a major issue regarding the accuracy in determining the operational well depth for “in well” work. During RLWI operation in deep water, the environmental conditions will have much influence to the wireline part that is suspended in open water. It is found very difficult to measure part of the cable length that has been submerged into the well since it depends on the “deflection shape” of the cable after it get exposed to the varying sea current from surface to sea bottom. The environmental load from sea current acting along the cable length will be transformed into uplift force on the other end of the cable inside the well. The combination of vertical displacement in upward direction due to uplift force and in downward direction due to cable stretch will affect the accuracy of the well depth measurement and position control of the downhole tool. Depth accuracy is very crucial in performing work inside the well. This project will study the cable behavior under prevailing dynamic sea environment for RLWI <b>wireline</b> <b>operation</b> in North Sea and will present one approach to correct inaccuracy in determining the exact location of the downhole tool inside the well from marine perspective. The study case was taken from Aasta Hansteen field with 1300 meters water depth in particular. OrcaFlex software will be utilized to perform static and dynamic analysis of the wireline cable under sea current and wave effect. OrcaFlex was developed by Orcina to support a wide range of hydrodynamic and marine structural analysis, including modeling the cable under sea current. During the analysis, the wireline behavior under currents will be observed for different operational well depth cases. The analysis results obtained from OrcaFlex simulations are vertical displacements and forces acting upon the wireline. Then recommended measures are discussed in this thesis to maximize the accuracy during “in well” work with different types of downhole tool weight. In addition, this thesis will also discuss the latest technologies of light well intervention, such as well control equipments used nowadays in RLWI operations...|$|R
40|$|Cost {{reduction}} in {{the oil and gas}} industry forces new and innovative solutions. Unmanned wellhead platforms are alternative solutions for developing small fields which would normally be developed with subsea wellheads. For an installation to be approved to operate on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, it must be designed against accidental actions such as fire. Current rules regarding design against fire loads has been reviewed, showing examples of heat transfer hand calculations, as well as material's strength degradation as function of temperature. A generic wellhead platform has been designed, based on comparable structures, and simple hand calculations to have a reasonable model to work with. Conservativeness has been applied to end up with a tough structure and reduce the need for passive fire protection. The structure was tested against normal operational loads and were proven to have more than sufficient resistance. Operational-, variable maintenance- and accidental loads has been established with help from Trond Granli in Kværner. Characteristic fire scenarios were provided and cases set up. A shell script has been adapted for use on the heat transfer and response simulations. Trouble with multi- threading simulations prevented it from functioning perfectly, but it worked for single- threading. A large amount of simulations has been run, resulting in the conclusion that loads relating to <b>wireline</b> well intervention <b>operations</b> in combination with moderate jet fires is survived by the structure. Reserve strength ratios in the range above 4. 5 were exhibited. The case of accidental jack- up rig cantilever collapse was shown to be tolerated, and the case involving a large jet fire inside the platform also survived the duration of the characteristic fire scenario. But further simulations are recommended to confirm. Temperature- domain simulations has been run to validate a few of the pushdown simulations, with promising results. A good pool fire model was not established, but was simulated with the standard hydrocarbon temperature curve. The results showed adequately strength after the duration of the fire...|$|R
40|$|With the {{explosion}} of information hungry computational and multimedia applications, the need for exceptionally high communication data rates has leapt {{to the forefront of}} electronic design. Advances is silicon technologies, manifested both in the speed of the transistors and complexity of the IC wiring stack, has bolstered the ability to meet new communication needs on a platform common to most consumer electronics. This ability becomes beneficial to historical approaches, both in system performance and costs, with the later being a huge benefit over existing solutions. 	In this work the design of high speed wireless and wired communications on silicon platforms is investigated. The work uses both standard silicon CMOS technologies and silicon germanium BiCMOS technologies to demonstrate operations beyond 100 GHz and 100 GB/s. Activities in the wireless domain investigate both receivers and transmitters up to 100 GHz, with the most substantial work performed on the design and analysis of voltage controlled oscillators and low noise amplifiers. Differential and quadrature VCOs have been designed for operation between 16 - 64 GHz, with innovation in design methodologies and varactor degeneration. LNA design has been performed for operation from 20 - 110 GHz, with emphasis on balanced/unbalanced <b>operations.</b> <b>Wireline</b> development has focused on the design of two parallel systems for operation beyond 80 GB/s and 120 GB/s. Parallel development of half-rate 4 to 1 multiplexers and 1 to 4 demultiplexers has been performed, as well as development of a 60 GB/s full rate flip-flop and 60 GHz static divider. Aggressive clocking techniques were developed to enable broadband operation from below 1 GB/s to the upper frequency bounds, and an area-centric design methodology was developed to mitigate the common perils of high frequency design. 	Collectively, the circuits demonstrated here show a methodology aimed at enabling high frequency design despite the hurdles inherent in silicon processes. Most of these techniques are aimed at combating the limitations of the silicon substrate, even beyond the frequency limitations of the devices, and towards overcoming the amplified effects of interchip wiring at increased frequencies. In many instances the latter effects drive the electrical design of the circuits, where certain conventional techniques for high frequency design become impaired and undesirable...|$|R

50|$|If the {{wireline}} were {{to become}} severed from the tool, a ball check valve can seal the well off from the surface. During <b>wireline</b> <b>operations,</b> a steel ball sits {{to the side of}} a confined area within the grease head while the cable runs {{in and out of the}} hole. If the wireline exits that confined area under pressure, the pressure will force the steel ball up towards the hole where the wireline had been. The ball's diameter is larger than that of the hole, so the ball effectively seals off pressure to the surface.|$|E
50|$|The {{pressure}} control employed during <b>wireline</b> <b>operations</b> {{is intended to}} contain pressure originating from the well bore.

Normal ratings for wireline pressure equipment is 5,000, 10,000, and 15,000 pounds per square inch. Some wells are contained with 20,000 psi and 30,000 psi equipment is in development also.|$|E
40|$|As the world's largest ocean, the Pacific is {{intricately}} {{linked to}} {{major changes in}} the global climate system. Throughout the Cenozoic, Pacific plate motion has had a northward component. Thus, the Pacific is unique in that the thick sediment bulge of biogenic-rich deposits from the currently narrowly focused zone of equatorial upwelling is slowly moving away from the Equator. Hence, older sections are not deeply buried and can be recovered by drilling. Previous drilling in this area during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Legs 138 and 199 was remarkably successful in giving us new insights into the workings of the climate and carbon system, productivity changes across the zone of divergence, time-dependent calcium carbonate dissolution, bio- and magnetostratigraphy, the location of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and evolutionary patterns for times of climatic change and upheaval. Together with older Deep Sea Drilling Project drilling in the eastern equatorial Pacific, both legs also helped to delineate the position of the paleoequator and variations in sediment thickness from ~ 150 °W to 110 °W. The Pacific equatorial age transect (PEAT) science program is based on Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Proposal 626 and consists of Expeditions 317 and 319, grouped into one science program. The goal is to recover a continuous Cenozoic record of the equatorial Pacific by drilling at the paleoposition of the Equator at successive crustal ages on the Pacific plate. Records collected from Expeditions 317 and 319 are to be joined with records of previous drilling during ODP Legs 138 and 199 to make a complete equatorial Pacific record from 0 to 55 Ma. Previously, ODP Legs 138 and 199 were designed as transects across the paleoequator in order to study the changing patterns of sediment deposition across equatorial regions at critical time intervals. As we have gained more information about the past movement of plates and when in Earth's history "critical" climate events took place, it becomes possible to drill an age transect ("flow-line") along the position of the Pacific paleoequator. The goal of this transect is to target important time slices where calcareous sediments have been best preserved and the sedimentary archive will allow us to reconstruct past climatic and tectonic conditions. Leg 199 enhanced our understanding of extreme changes of the calcium carbonate compensation depth (CCD) across major geological boundaries during the last 55 m. y. A very shallow CCD during most of the Paleogene makes it difficult to obtain well-preserved sediments during these stratigraphic intervals, but the strategy of site locations for the current two expeditions is designed to occupy the most promising sites and to obtain a unique sedimentary biogenic sediment archive for time periods just after the Paleocene/Eocene boundary event, Eocene cooling, the Eocene–Oligocene transition, the "one cold pole" Oligocene, the Oligocene–Miocene transition, and the Miocene. These new cores and data will significantly contribute to the objectives of the IODP Extreme Climates Initiative and will provide material that the previous legs were not able to recover. For logistical reasons, the PEAT science program is composed of two expeditions but is being implemented as a single science program to best achieve the overall objectives of Proposal 626. Participants on both expeditions (as well as approved shore-based scientists) will comprise a single science party with equal access to data and materials from both cruises. Sampling aboard the ship will be minimal, and the bulk of the sampling will be completed postcruise. The operational plan is to occupy eight sites along the age transect with the goal of recovering as complete a sedimentary succession as possible. This will probably require three holes to be cored at each site with <b>wireline</b> logging <b>operations</b> in one hole. Basement will be tagged in {{at least one of the}} holes. Expedition 317 will be directed primarily to sample the Neogene sites (proposed Sites PEAT- 2 C, 6 C, and 7 C, in priority order). The second expedition (319) will primarily sample the Paleogene sites (proposed Sites PEAT- 1 C, 3 C, 4 C, and possibly 5 C, in priority order) ...|$|R

50|$|LWD, while {{sometimes}} {{risky and}} expensive, {{has the advantage}} of measuring properties of a formation before drilling fluids invade deeply.
