5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{building}} was a crane for ironware handling. When the frames were taken in, they were fitted with suspension and axles, and then turned the right way up. The next parts were the engine and transmission components. The final part for lorries was a pre-assembled cabin. Conventional bus chassis were delivered with bonnet and wings, but the forward control types left the factory without any body parts. After being painted, the vehicles left the assembly hall. Finally, every vehicle was tested on a -long test run on different roads and with various loads. The bus chassis <b>were</b> <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> a similar way; because there was no body, the drivers only had warm clothes and driving goggles to protect them against the weather conditions. The vehicles were handed over to the customers after final adjustments.|$|E
5|$|Edwards's fortifications <b>were</b> <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> 1294 when Madog ap Llywelyn {{rebelled against}} English rule, {{the first major}} insurrection since the conquest. The Welsh appear to have risen up over the {{introduction}} of taxation, and Madog had considerable popular support. By {{the end of the}} year, Edward had returned to Wales with a large army and marched west from Chester, reaching his castle at Conwy by Christmas. Here he was trapped and besieged until January 1295, supplied only by sea, before forces arrived to relieve him in February. Harlech was also besieged but was saved from defeat by the arrival of supplies by sea from Ireland. Caernarfon, however, was still only partially completed and was stormed by Welsh forces and the castle and town set alight. In Anglesey, Welsh forces killed the royal sheriff. In the spring Edward pressed home his counterattack with a force of 35,000 soldiers, putting down the uprising and killing Madog.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the ALBC began {{investigating}} the Marsh Tacky {{to see if}} it was truly a descendent of Spanish stock, and during the organization's initial field investigations it was found that many surviving members of the breed fit the physical type of Colonial Spanish stock. In 2007, the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy collaborated with the Equus Survival Trust to collect DNA samples and photo-document the largest herd in South Carolina, considered to be the largest remaining herd, with a heritage tracing back to the American Civil War. DNA testing was undertaken in an effort to identify horses for a new studbook, reveal what DNA markers the breed carries, and map the breed's genetic place among all other horse breeds worldwide. Sixty horses <b>were</b> <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> the effort.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, a study {{conducted}} by , UC Davis, US Forest Service, and the Hoopa Tribe showed that fishers in California were exposed to and killed by anticoagulant rodenticides associated with marijuana cultivation. In this study, 79% of fishers that <b>were</b> <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> California were exposed to an average of 1.61 different anticoagulant rodenticides and four fishers died directly attributed to these toxicants. A 2015 follow-up study building on this data determined that the trend of exposure and mortality from these toxicants increased to 85%, that California fishers were now exposed to an average of 1.73 different anticoagulant rodenticides, and that nine more fishers died, bringing the total to 13. The extent of marijuana cultivation within fishers' home ranges was highlighted in a 2013 study focusing on fisher survival and impacts from marijuana cultivation within the Sierra National Forest. Research showed that fishers had an average of 5.3 individual grow sites within their home range. One fisher had 16 individual grow sites within its territory.|$|E
5|$|In June2000, Icos and Texas Biotechnology {{formed a}} 50/50 {{partnership}} to research endothelin receptor antagonists {{for use in}} the areas of pulmonary hypertension and chronic heart failure. Two drugs, sitaxentan sodium (also spelled sitaxsentan) and TBC3711, <b>were</b> <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> clinical trials under the partnership. Sitaxentan was designed to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, and TBC3711 was designed to treat cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension. In April2003, Icos sold its part of the 50/50 partnership, including any share of sitaxentan and TBC3711, to Texas Biotechnology for $4million at closing and another $6million within 18months. Sitaxentan sodium was later approved in Europe, Canada, and Australia, and was marketed under the brand name Thelin. In 2010, Thelin was voluntarily withdrawn from the market worldwide due to concerns about irreversible liver damage.|$|E
5|$|In March 1989, {{the first}} buses <b>were</b> <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> the tunnel; University Street station was only 75 percent complete, and buses {{had to drive}} under {{scaffolding}} and construction equipment while passing through the station. Tunnel construction was completed in June 1990, and a soft opening for University Street station was held on August 9, 1990. Bus service in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel began on September 15, 1990, with several Metro bus routes moved into the tunnel from surface streets. All service on routes using the tunnel was operated by dual-mode buses, which operated as diesel buses outside the tunnel and electrically, as trolleybuses, when inside the tunnel. During its early months, University Street and other stations were affected by serious water leaks, which splashed water onto walkways during the tunnel's first winter in operation. The leaks were later fixed by Metro contractors.|$|E

Although Margaret Mitchell refused to publicly name her choice, the actress who came closest to winning her approval was Miriam Hopkins, who Mitchell felt was just the right type of actress to play Scarlett as written in the book. However, Hopkins was in her mid-thirties {{at the time and}} was considered too old for the part. Four actresses, including Jean Arthur and Joan Bennett, were still under consideration by December 1938; however, only two finalists, Paulette Goddard and Vivien Leigh, <b>were</b> <b>tested</b> <b>in</b> Technicolor, both on December 20. Goddard almost won the role, but controversy over her marriage with Charlie Chaplin caused Selznick to change his mind.|$|E
