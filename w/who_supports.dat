5|$|Philosopher Onora O'Neill, {{who studied}} under John Rawls at ￼Harvard University, is a {{contemporary}} Kantian ethicist <b>who</b> <b>supports</b> a Kantian approach {{to issues of}} social justice. O'Neill argues that a successful Kantian account of social justice must not rely on any unwarranted idealizations or assumption. She notes that philosophers have previously charged Kant with idealizing humans as autonomous beings, without any social context or life goals, though maintains that Kant's ethics can be read without such an idealization. O'Neill prefers Kant's conception of reason as practical and available {{to be used by}} humans, rather than as principles attached to every human being. Conceiving of reason as a tool to make decisions with means that the only thing able to restrain the principles we adopt is that they could be adopted by all. If we cannot will that everyone adopts a certain principle, then we cannot give them reasons to adopt it. To use reason, and to reason with other people, we must reject those principles that cannot be universally adopted. In this way, O'Neill reached Kant's formulation of universalisability without adopting an idealistic view of human autonomy. This model of universalisability does not require that we adopt all universalisable principles, but merely prohibits us from adopting those that are not.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to reexamine, through a look at {{childcare}} support workers practice cases, analytical frameworks regarding ability formation of those <b>who</b> <b>support</b> study. Much research has been performed so far using the theory of “Reflection” to discuss the role of practice in the ability formation of those <b>who</b> <b>support</b> study. “Reflection” as used in previous research regarding those <b>who</b> <b>support</b> study has treated formal educational as its area of analysis. Namely, there has been a tendency in research on ability formation of those <b>who</b> <b>support</b> study to employ the theory of “Reflection” to fixed-form course and training session situations. However, ability formation of those <b>who</b> <b>support</b> study occurs not only in formal learning settings alone. It is thought that the process of acquiring new knowledge and skills via the process of awareness, learning, and growing while supporting the learner amidst a relationship of praxis, also leads to the ability formation of those <b>who</b> <b>support</b> study. Therefore, it is it is necessary to examine ability formation by examining not only approaches in formal settings in which courses and training have been set, and programs developed intentionally, for those <b>who</b> <b>support</b> study, but also to widen one 2 ̆ 7 s view to include nonformal settings in which ability formation occurs as a natural result of daily practice. Based on this premise, this study seeks to clarify ability formation of those <b>who</b> <b>support</b> study in nonformal settings by focusing on workers involved in childcare support. My examination centers on interviews with such supporters to consider how their ability forms through daily interactions with parents and children. In interviewing, I invoked a “praxis daily life based” method of collaborative learning to clarify the study supporter 2 ̆ 7 s ability formation in nonformal settings...|$|R
