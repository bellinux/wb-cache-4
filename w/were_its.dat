5|$|Although the Merger Agreements were principally {{intended}} for smaller, non-viable states, {{they were also}} applied to a few larger states. Kutch in western India, and Tripura and Manipur in Northeast India, all of which lay along international borders, {{were also asked to}} sign Merger Agreements, despite being larger states, following which they became Chief Commissioners' Provinces. Bhopal, whose ruler was proud of the efficiency of his administration and feared that it would lose its identity if merged with the Maratha states that <b>were</b> <b>its</b> neighbours, also became a directly administered Chief Commissioner's Province, as did Bilaspur, much of which was likely to be flooded on completion of the Bhakra dam.|$|E
5|$|Descent 3 {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, holding {{a score of}} 89 out of 100 at review aggregate website Metacritic.

An official expansion pack, Descent 3: Mercenary, was released on December 3, 1999. The expansion pack includes {{a new series of}} missions, multiplayer maps, and a level editor. After its release on Microsoft Windows, the game was subsequently ported to Mac OS and Linux platforms.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XIII was {{positively}} received in Japanese magazines, garnering exceptionally high scores from both Famitsu and Dengeki PlayStation. In the west, {{the game was}} praised for its graphics, battle system, and music, but opinions were mixed about its story and it was criticized for its highly linear structure. XIII also won an award for best graphics in GamesRadars 2012 Platinum Trophy Awards. XIII-2 received a positive reception overall, gaining perfect scores from Famitsu and Dengeki PlayStation, and high scores from most western sites. Common points of praise <b>were</b> <b>its</b> non-linear nature, improved battle system and graphics, while the main points of criticism <b>were</b> <b>its</b> story and characters, which were often called weak, confusing or both. Lightning Returns received mixed to positive reviews, with its combat being highly praised, its graphics and time limit mechanic drawing mixed responses, and the story and characters being cited as poorly developed.|$|E

5|$|In {{a preview}} of the TGS demo, Ryan Geddes of IGN was left excited as to where the game would go after {{completing}} the demo, along with enjoying the improved visuals over Valkyria Chronicles II. Kotaku's Richard Eisenbeis was highly positive about the game, citing is story as a return to form after Valkyria Chronicles II and its gameplay being the best in the series. His main criticisms <b>were</b> <b>its</b> length and gameplay repetition, along with expressing regret {{that it would not be}} localized.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to territorial disputes, the League {{also tried to}} intervene in other conflicts between and within nations. Among its successes <b>were</b> <b>its</b> fight against the international trade in opium and sexual slavery, and its work to alleviate the plight of refugees, particularly in Turkey in the period up to 1926. One of its innovations in this latter area was the 1922 introduction of the Nansen passport, {{which was the first}} internationally recognised identity card for stateless refugees.|$|E
5|$|In summary, {{the main}} {{competencies}} of the Tagora <b>were</b> <b>its</b> spacious cabin (though {{it was not}} class-leading), its comfortable seating, its fuel economy (in 2.2 GLS form) {{and the size of}} its luggage compartment (572 litres). But the fact that a car launched in 1974, the Volvo 244 GLE, could offer better seats, disc brakes all round, better headlights, better ventilation and better handling for only slightly more than Talbot was charging for their car indicated that the Tagora had come to market with a vehicle that was uncompetitive in too many major respects.|$|E

5|$|One {{alternative}} was the turbo-electric drive where the steam turbine generated electrical power which then drove the propellers. This was particularly favoured by the US Navy, which {{used it for}} all dreadnoughts from late 1915–1922. The advantages of this method <b>were</b> <b>its</b> low cost, the opportunity for very close underwater compartmentalization, and good astern performance. The disadvantages were that the machinery was heavy and vulnerable to battle damage, particularly the effects of flooding on the electrics.|$|E

5|$|The Victor was a futuristic-looking, {{streamlined}} aircraft, {{with four}} turbojet (later turbofan) engines {{buried in the}} thick wing roots. Distinguishing features of the Victor <b>were</b> <b>its</b> highly swept T-tail with considerable dihedral on the tail planes, and a prominent chin bulge that contained the targeting radar, cockpit, nose landing gear unit and an auxiliary bomb aimer's position. It was originally required by the specification that the whole nose section could be detached at high altitudes {{to act as an}} escape pod, but the Air Ministry abandoned this demand in 1950.|$|E
5|$|The {{human body}} absorbs {{strontium}} {{as if it}} <b>were</b> <b>its</b> lighter congener calcium.

5|$|As {{a direct}} result of {{watching}} his fellow martial artists train with a fixed-blade fighting knife in class, yet carry some type of a folding knife when they left the training area, Emerson decided there was a need for a sturdy folding knife designed primarily for combat. Although Emerson had always maintained that the knives he made were built as fighting knives first and foremost, in October 1985 he stripped down five of these designs to simpler materials. He continued his use of linen or canvas micarta because of its high tensile strength and superior gripping surface when wet; he decided on black or dark grey for the color instead of the brighter colors used previously. He retained the titanium for the liners and bolsters but chose to bead-blast them a flat grey matte color as opposed to the colorful anodizing which used to appear on his knives. The reasons for using titanium <b>were</b> <b>its</b> exceptional strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance.|$|E

5|$|Bravely Default {{was first}} {{announced}} in September 2011 {{as part of}} Nintendo's 2012 lineup for the platform. In the run-up to release, multiple demos were developed, and the team adjusted the game using feedback from players. For the Sequel was the version chosen for overseas release, being localized without any subtitle. In both Japan and overseas, Bravely Default met with strong sales and critical acclaim. Common praise went to the gameplay's mixture of traditional mechanics and new elements, along with its storyline, graphics and music. Main points of criticism <b>were</b> <b>its</b> repetitive late-game stages and elements of its social gameplay and audio. Bravely Default spawned multiple media tie-ins and spin-off games. A direct sequel, , was released in 2015 in Japan and 2016 overseas.|$|E
5|$|Famitsu {{praised the}} idea of making a game based around trials, which they found to be innovative, and found it exhilarating and fun to uncover witnesses' lies. Thomas Bowskill at Nintendo Life said that the game had changed his idea of what can make for a great game, and called it a masterpiece. Carrie Gouskos at GameSpot said that the game revitalized the {{adventure}} game genre. Michael Cole at Nintendo World Report said that the game's design and interface would make it a good choice for non-gamers as well. Bowskill called the investigation sections tedious and boring at times, but said that they were outweighed by the feeling of accomplishment from solving the cases. Craig Harris at IGN felt that the main issues with the game <b>were</b> <b>its</b> linearity, and how the puzzles are simple because of how the player can stop a witness testimony at any time. Cole, too, felt that the game was very linear, and that it was unclear how to proceed at certain points. He said that, because of how story-driven it is, the game has low replay value; he still felt that players might want to replay it after a few years.|$|E
5|$|N. T. Rama Rao and Savitri {{were chosen}} for the leading parts, with Jaggayya, C. S. R. Anjaneyulu, S. V. Ranga Rao and Jamuna in {{supporting}} roles; Jamuna had no dialogue {{for most of the}} film. It was Rama Rao's 55th film as an actor, and Jaggayya's first film for Vijaya Vauhini Studios. Jaggayya replaced Akkineni Nageswara Rao, who bowed out due to scheduling conflicts. Jaggayya had worked with Prasad as a voice artist for the Telugu-dubbed version of the director's Manohara (1954), starring Sivaji Ganesan. Comedian Potti Prasad and Padmanabham made appearances as the prospective bridegrooms of Girija, who played Relangi Venkata Ramaiah fiancée; the former made his Telugu cinema debut with this film. Prasad, who received 1,116 for his single scene, praised Nagi Reddy and Chakrapani's generosity. Marcus Bartley was the film's director of photography. Saluri Rajeswara Rao composed the soundtrack and background score, assisted by Ogirala Ramachandra Rao and K. Prasada Rao. Ramachandra Rao's son, Narasimhamurthy, was cast as a child artiste. G. Kalyanasundaram and K. Radhakrishna edited the film, and Madhavapeddi Gokhale and Kaladhar <b>were</b> <b>its</b> art directors.|$|E
