The goal of an effective occupational Risk Analysis and Management, coherent to the national enforcements of the European safety regulations for the exploitation plan and development, nvolves a pro-active approach. The statistical data confirms in fact that the extractive activities should be considered with special care, due to the impressive figures of <b>work</b> <b>related</b> <b>accidents</b> (in number and seriousness), and of the health impairments associated with the presence of quite noxious pollutants at the workplaces. Taken into account on one hand the impressive developments in the geotechnics - geomechanic sciences, and in the mining techniques and technologies, {{and on the other hand}} the results of the recent epidemiologic surveys, in particular with reference to the possible criticality of the silica dust, a Prevention through Design approach appears to be the only solution to correctly manage the substantially modified overall safety situation.

The requirements for the different cases to be registered in the statistics have been investigated, in unity with the issue in question. The requirements that have been considered, as the most important, are presented in the Slutsats och rekommendationer chapter. The main goal {{of the study was to}} examine if the statistics published by Transportstyrelsen (TS) are an appropriate benchmark in the preventive work regarding occupational hazards. In Sweden, there is an information system regarding work-related injuries (ISA) whose statutory aim is that the statistics should create a basis for the preventive work with the work environment. All of the statistics were compared to enhance the understanding of the validity between the statistics presented by TS, the social insurance office Försäkringskassan and AFA insurances, which manages collective agreement insurances. The statistics from TS and AFA concerned work-related injuries and diseases. The social insurance office could only present statistics over the number of validated dossiers when the employer had requested compensation. The answer to one of the questions at issue, the actual statistical numbers of cases during 2011, is presented in the results chapter. The report was done on behalf of Pekka Räisänen, a Finnish researcher who studies the field of <b>work</b> <b>related</b> <b>accidents.</b> Pekkas research studies the Nordic countries statistics and searches for an appropriate way for the maritime authorities in the Nordic countries to present accident statistics.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionShoulder {{arthroscopy}} is {{reputed to}} be painful, but progression of postoperative pain after this type of surgery has never been described and analyzed. This study had a triple objective: the description, search for risk factors, {{and analysis of the}} long-term impact of postoperative pain. Patients and methodsThis continuous prospective series includes 231 patients who underwent arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Pain was evaluated from D− 1 to D 3, then at D 7, D 30, and 1 year. Three pain criteria were noted: visual analog scale (VAS), morphine intake, and satisfaction with pain management. Surgery was performed under general anesthesia and/or interscalene block. A local anesthetic complement was administered in one of four modes: single subacromial injection, subacromial catheter, intra-articular catheter, or no complement. ResultsThe VAS values remained less than 4 out of 10 during the entire study. Immediate postoperative pain was less than preoperative pain. It was followed by a pain bounce on D 1 and D 2 and did not return to a level significantly lower than its preoperative value until D 30. Rotator cuff repair is the most painful surgery in the first postoperative days. The main risk factor for pain is a <b>work</b> <b>related</b> <b>accident</b> or occupational disease, associated with higher VAS values from D 1 to 1 year and greater morphine intake. There was no correlation between immediate postoperative and 1 -year VAS values. Discussion, conclusionPain after shoulder arthroscopy is relatively low and the efficacy of the intervention is long-lasting in terms of pain symptom. A pain bounce appears on D 1, which must be taken into account, notably in the context of outpatient surgery. The use of local anesthesia is therefore advantageous. Despite the efficacy of postoperative pain relief protocols, their effect on longer term perspective was not demonstrated. Level of evidenceLevel IV. Descriptive cohort study...|$|E

The high number of <b>work</b> <b>related</b> <b>accidents</b> in maintenance/improvement yards, often characterized by dramatic Severity Rates, requires a special Risk Assessment and Management. The paper summarizes the results of a research leading to identify the main parameters directly or indirectly conditioning the design and safety of the highway maintenance yards. We developed a schematization of yard typologies and contexts, upon which a thorough Risk Assessment and Management becomes possible. Moreover, an original Accident Analysis Technique provided precious support to the study, filling the gaps of information on the Standards violations of some accident databases. Finally, the paper discusses some innovative Safety Control measures for different highway scenarios...|$|R
