40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: Crib-biting/windsucking behaviour has important consequences for equine health and welfare. Lay perceptions {{of health and}} illness are of interest to medical sociologists, providing important information to medical practitioners, but have infrequently been applied in veterinary research. Objectives: To demonstrate how lay epidemiology can be applied within veterinary research by exploring the lay perceptions regarding the causes of crib-biting/windsucking behaviour in horses. Methods: Informants were recruited from professional and amateur horse owners who had or had not owned/cared for a horse that exhibited crib-biting/windsucking behaviour. In-depth interviews were used to examine perceptions {{about the development of}} this behaviour within each group until a ‘saturation’ of themes emerged. Results: The main themes that emerged as causes of crib-biting/windsucking behaviour were ‘boredom’, ‘stress’ and ‘habit/addiction’. In the group of owners/carers who did not have direct experience of this type of behaviour, ‘copying’ from other horses emerged as a strong theme and they stated that they would not wish to own a crib-biting/ <b>windsucking</b> horse. In contrast, those who had direct experience of horses demonstrating this behaviour did not believe copying was a cause based on their own observations and would not be put off purchasing or caring for another horse displaying this behaviour. Conclusions: Perceptions about what causes crib-biting/ <b>windsucking</b> was influenced by whether or not informants had personal experience of horses demonstrating this behaviour. The three main themes that emerged have some justification based on current research and highlight the need for further investigation into the underlying pathophysiology of crib-biting/windsucking behaviour. Potential relevance: Qualitative approaches to health, disease and behaviour have {{an important role in the}} medical field and are applicable to veterinary researc...|$|E

40|$|A case control {{study was}} {{performed}} to identify risk factors for colic caused by simple colonic obstruction and distension (SCOD) in the horse. Case horses were recruited from 2 veterinary school clinics. Control horses were population based and matched by time of year. A number of risk factors were considered in the following areas: general carer and premises information; exercise information; husbandry information (housing- and pasture-related); feeding information; breeding information; behavioural information; travel information; preventive medicine information and previous medical information. All variables with a P value of < 0. 2 in the univariable analysis were considered for possible inclusion in a multivariable model. A final model, produced by a forward stepwise method, identified crib-biting or <b>windsucking,</b> {{an increasing number of}} hours spent in a stable, a recent change in a regular exercise programme, the absence of administration of an ivermectin or moxidectin anthelmintic in the previous 12 months and a history of travel in the previous 24 h as associated with a significantly increased risk of SCOD. An alternative final model, produced by a backwards elimination method, identified the same variables as the forward model with, in addition, a history of residing on the current establishment for less than 6 months, a history of a previous colic episode and the fewer times per year the teeth were checked/treated as associated with a significantly increased risk of SCOD. Three of the risk factors in this model were associated with a large increase in risk: stabling for 24 h/day, crib-biting/windsucking and travel in the previous 24 h...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Although it {{is widely}} {{asserted}} by horse owners that diet affects the tractability of horses, {{there have been few}} controlled studies of this subject. We report here the results of a preliminary trial to investigate the effects of diet and exercise on the behaviour of four stabled horses. The horses were maintained on all combinations of two exercise regimens (light and strenuous) and two diets (forage and mixed forage and grain). Horses were kept on each of the four diet and exercise regimens for a period of four weeks in an order determined by a Latin Square. Observations were made on 3 consecutive days in the second and fourth weeks of each period, during a set handling routine, and on 3 consecutive days in the second week during a four hour period when housed in stalls. Methods: During the handling trials the horses were observed when being [i] groomed with a rubber curry comb, [ii] a dandy brush, [iii] picking out the hooves [iv] sponging the face [v] sponging the dock [vi] applying fly spray and [vii] fitting a surcingle mounted heart monitor. In the second week of each diet/excercise treatment the horses were videotaped while housed in stalls between 12 noon and 4 pm. When in the stalls five minute scan sampling of the behaviour of each individual in turn was concentrated on three 30 minutes observation periods constituting the beginning, middle and end of the four hour period. Behaviour was recorded from videotapes using the Observer 3 and analysed using multifactor ANOVA in SPSS for Windows. Results: During the handling trials the main effect on the behaviour of the horses was associated with exercise. Horses which had been only lightly exercised exhibited significantly higher frequencies of a number of "unco-operative" behaviour patterns e. g. (Fig. 1) Head Evasion (F= 71. 8 (1, 3) P< 0. 01). During the periods of stall housing diet was found to {{have a significant effect on}} a number of behaviour patterns. Horses receiving the mixed diet exhibited higher frequencies of (Fig. 2) Head Down (F= 15. 7 (1, 3) P< 0. 05) and Rest Leg (F= 10. 8 (1, 3) P< 0. 05) during the third period of scan sampling. Repeated investigation of the floor associated with Head Down and high frequencies of Rest Leg which indicated repeated transfer of weight from one back leg to the other, suggest a state of restlessness associated with confinement when maintained on a mixed diet. There was an interaction between diet and exercise for a number of redirected oral behaviour patterns e. g. (Fig. 3) Lick Object (F= 20. 4 (1, 3) P< 0. 05) with highest mean durations being recorded for horses receiving the mixed diet and light exercise. Only one horse exhibited <b>Windsucking</b> in the trial, and did so only when receiving the mixed diet. Frequency and duration of <b>Windsucking</b> (Fig. 4) were highest when receiving a mixed diet and light exercise. Conclusion Although this preliminary trial is restricted by a small sample size it has indicated that both diet and exercise can produce effects on the behaviour of the four horses studied. The link between diet and behaviour in horses suggested by the trial warrants further investigation. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Background: Crib-biting and <b>windsucking</b> (CBWS) {{behaviour}} in horses {{has been}} associated with increased risk of colic in general, recurrence of colic and specific forms of colic. The aims of the present study were to determine the prevalence of colic within a population of horses that display CBWS behaviour and to identify risk factors for colic. Methods: Owners/carers of horses in the general UK equine population that display CBWS behaviour were invited to participate in a questionnaire-based survey about the management and health of these horses. Data were obtained for a number of variables considered to be possible risk factors for colic. The prevalence of colic was calculated and multivariable logistic regression was used to identify associations between horse- and management-level variables for two outcomes of interest: a history of colic ever and a history of colic in the previous 12 months. Results: Data were obtained for 367 horses. One or more episodes of colic had been observed in 130 horses (35. 4 %). A total of 672 colic episodes were reported and 13 colic episodes required surgical intervention in 12 horses. Where the horse/pony had been in that persons care over the previous 12 months (n= 331), colic had been observed in 67 horses (20. 2 %) during that time. A total of 126 colic episodes were reported in the preceding 12 months of which veterinary attendance was required in 69 (54. 8 %) episodes. Increased duration of ownership, increased duration of stabling in the Autumn months (September-November), crib-biting/windsucking behaviour associated with eating forage and horses that were fed haylage were associated with increased risk of colic (ever). Increasing severity (frequency) of CBWS behaviour and increased duration of stabling in the Autumn were associated with increased risk of colic in the previous 12 months. Conclusions: The prevalence of colic in a population of horses that display CBWS appeared to be relatively high. The results of this study can be used to identify horses that display CBWS who are at increased risk of colic and identifies areas for further research to determine if there are ways in which this risk might be reduced...|$|E
