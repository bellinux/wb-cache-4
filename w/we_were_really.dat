5|$|Yeah, we {{were over}} the moon. We don't play ourselves, {{because most people}} won't know who we are, but they'll look like yellow {{versions}} of ourselves. We play counsellors at an arts camp that Lisa's going to. It's pretty fun. We just went to a studio and recorded it, but, yeah, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> flattered.|$|E
5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E
25|$|Neal {{started to}} write {{some of his}} {{ensembles}} {{with some of the}} figures that come from that early bebop thing. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> one of the first bands outside of Dizzy's big band that flavored bebop into the big band — different tonal quality and rhythms, and the drum feeling started changing, and that I think was really the beginning of it...|$|E

25|$|I wasn't {{meant to}} be the lead singer of the band. My whole idea was to play the {{saxophone}} and I really wanted Stephen Cummings to be the singer, 'cause <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> great mates but for whatever reason he bowed out after {{just a couple of}} rehearsals. We had a full list of songs by Wayne Burt and that really made the difference for us. I wasn't writing any songs really and I thought Wayne was a much better singer than me as well but he didn't want to be the lead singer, so we sort of shared it around for a little while. – Joe Camilleri.|$|E
500|$|Coldplay vocalist Chris Martin said, {{about the}} writing of the song, [...] "That came out of playing live and wanting to have {{something}} with a bit more bounce. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> getting into things like PJ Harvey and Muse– things with a bit more energy." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{many respects}} (to Kennan's consternation) the {{priorities}} of the administration emphasized creating alliances against the Soviets more than negotiating differences with them. In his memoirs, Kennan recalled, [...] "So far as I could see, we were expecting {{to be able to}} gain our objectives... without making any concessions though, only 'if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> all-powerful, and could hope to get away with it.' I very much doubted that this was the case." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{surviving}} the bombardment, the POWs were resettled in a camp near Munich. The Germans {{gave them the}} opportunity to return to Nuremberg as wounded soldiers to obtain treatment; the POWs agreed because it was closer to the American lines. On April 17, American troops secured Nuremberg and subsequently freed the POWs. Juskalian described the event: [...] "When the Germans tried to see if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> wounded, the British erected a sign on the gate saying 'Plague', and that kept them out, three or four days later, the 45th U.S. Infantry Division overran Nuremberg and we were liberated." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's second {{video was}} {{released}} via Kesha's YouTube account. She revealed the video's completion, release and inspiration through a video description quote saying, [...] "heyy {{to all my}} fans! so me [...] my friends were bored and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> channeling some 80's [...] (Tron, David Bowie in Labyrinth, and Revenge of the Nerds.) and we made this new video for take it off. it was really fun to make. i hope you guys like it". The video was directed by Skinny. This version of the video is known as [...] "Take it Off (K$ N' Friends Version)".|$|E
500|$|Ferguson remarked the Shield {{should not}} have been settled on penalties; to him it was a [...] "celebration of success", though {{ultimately}} he was delighted his team won. He was pleased with the team's start – [...] "I thought in the first 25 minutes <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> good and could have tied the match up then" [...] – and considered lining the team up in a 4–3–3 formation to begin with, though wanted to see [...] "how Keane played with Ince, what the balance was like". Ince believed he should have been awarded a penalty after Jensen fouled him: [...] "I was past their last man {{and there was no way}} I would have dived from there." ...|$|E

500|$|The band Them {{was signed}} by Phil Solomon, who {{contracted}} producer Bert Berns {{to work with the}} group, and Phil Coulter came on as a musical arranger and lyricist. The group became popular with songs including [...] "Baby Please Don't Go", [...] "Gloria", and [...] "Here Comes the Night". Morrison commented of Them: [...] "Them were never meant to be on Top of the Pops. I mean, miming? lip syncing? We used to laugh at that programme, think it was a joke. Then we were on it ourselves. It was ridiculous. We were totally anti that sort of thing. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> into the blues... and we had to get into suits and have make-up put on and all that shit." ...|$|E
500|$|Martin, who {{finished}} second, was candid about the result, [...] "We did really well to finish second. I just don't {{think we were}} in [...] league today." [...] In the post-race press conference, Kenseth said of his result, [...] "We didn't qualify very good, but <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> happy with our car. When the race started, I didn't think we were quite {{as good as we}} were yesterday (in practice), but we were able to have really good pit stops." [...] Logano, who was involved in the biggest accident of the race, [...] "The biggest thing was, I was fine the whole time, [...] I'm not really sure what happened. The spotter was clearing me low. When I got down there, they checked up going into the corner and I got tagged from behind." ...|$|E
500|$|A 1–1 draw against Liverpool {{in early}} April, {{sandwiched}} in between Champions League legs between both teams [...] "disappointed" [...] Wenger, {{who refused to}} concede winning the title. Defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford on 13 April 2008, however ended any realistic chance of overtaking the leaders, as United, the champions, needed two more wins to retain the title. Arsenal beat relegation-threatened Reading 2–0 the week after. Adebayor scored a hat-trick against Derby County on 28 April 2008, which made him {{the first player to}} score three goals, home and away against the same side in the same season. The win secured third place, pleasing Wenger who felt the team had a [...] "great future – I believe <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> unlucky not to win something this year." [...] Arsenal won their remaining two fixtures against Everton and Sunderland by a single goal, ending the campaign four points behind champions Manchester United.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{introduces}} two new {{characters to}} the series, portrayed by Aaron Munoz (Tony) and Michael Raymond-James (Dave). Although {{they were killed}} off in the episode, writer Robert Kirkman wanted to evoke a reaction that the characters would recur throughout the series. [...] "With the casting of those two guys and everything involving that scene <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> {{trying to convince the}} audience {{that they were going to}} be new regulars, so the end would be that much more shocking." [...] Kirkman felt that Tony and Dave represent new threats and anxieties for the group. [...] "I think this was a particularly good episode coming back because the two guys in the bar represent new threats and they are really just the tip of the iceberg," [...] he stated. [...] "It's really good to come back and be off of the farm and see that there are more dangerous things out there than the zombies. Things just keep getting worse from here.". [...] "The Regulator" [...] by Clutch was the song used as the closing title sequence.|$|E
500|$|The show {{began with}} [...] "Hurricane", {{followed}} by [...] "Alibi", [...] "Kings and Queens", [...] "Closer to the Edge", [...] "Night of the Hunter", [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name", and [...] "Message in a Bottle", originally by The Police. Short instrumental versions of songs by The Cure, Pantera and Slayer were also played by Tomo Miličević, Shannon Leto and Tim Kelleher. The Vitamin String Quartet musicians {{who took part}} in the recording included two violinists, a violist, a cellist and a conductor. The performance of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] featured The Late Show's Gospel Choir, consisting of five men and five women dressed in red. After filming, Jared Leto described the band's excitement about being asked to record for MTV Unplugged stating, [...] "I think our generation, it was kind of a rite of passage, and if you were invited to do MTV Unplugged, it certainly was a pretty big deal. So many of our favorite bands did 'Unplugged' and still do it, so <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> thrilled to be asked." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{began working}} on the track in 2011, with vocalist and guitarist Win Butler noting, [...] "We {{recorded}} {{a little bit in}} Louisiana with the Haitian percussionists [...] and we kind of lived with that. It's an incredibly long process." [...] Regular Arcade Fire collaborators Owen Pallett and Colin Stetson provided instrumental parts, alongside English musician David Bowie who provided vocals for the song. Regarding Bowie's guest appearance on the track, multi-instrumentalist Richard Reed Parry noted, [...] "It was just after The Next Day had come out. He basically just came by the studio in New York while we were mixing, just to have a listen to the stuff we were doing. He offered to lend us his services because he really liked the song. In fact, he basically threatened us – he was like, 'If you don't hurry up and mix this song, I might just steal it from you!' So we thought, well why don't we go one better, why don't you sing on our version? Thankfully he obliged, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> happy about that." ...|$|E
5000|$|Jim told Magic Radio that he {{believed}} this album was [...] "probably the best album we've ever done. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> proud of it and hope the fans love it just as much." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No coffee, thanks," [...] Julien decided. [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> {{going to}} spend the evening visiting places of {{entertainment}} of a similar class, let us reserve our coffee. A large cigar, I think." ...|$|R
500|$|Sarria {{encouraged}} patrons {{to be as}} {{open and}} honest as possible. [...] "People were living double lives and I didn't understand it. It was persecution. Why be ashamed of who you are?" [...] He exhorted the clientele, [...] "There's nothing wrong with being gaythe crime is getting caught", and [...] "United we stand, divided they catch us one by one". At closing time he would call upon patrons to join hands and sing [...] "God Save Us Nelly Queens" [...] {{to the tune of}} [...] "God Save the Queen". Sometimes he would bring the crowd outside to sing the final verse to the men across the street in jail, who had been arrested in raids earlier in the night. Speaking of this ritual in the film , gay journalist George Mendenhall said: It sounds silly, but if you lived at that time and had the oppression coming down from the police department and from society, there was nowhere to turn... {{and to be able to}} put your arms around other gay men and to be able to stand up and sing 'God Save Us Nelly Queens'... <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> not saying 'God Save Us Nelly Queens.' We were saying 'We have our rights, too.' ...|$|E
500|$|Bird {{stuck to}} {{elaborate}} scene planning, such as detailed animatics, {{to make sure}} there were no budgetary concerns. The team initially worked with Macromedia's Director software, before switching to Adobe After Effects full-time. Bird was eager to use the then-nascent software, as it allowed for storyboard to contain indications of camera moves. The software became essential to that team—dubbed [...] "Macro" [...] early on—to help the studio grasp story reels for the film. These also allowed Bird to better understand what the film required from an editing perspective. In the end, he was proud of the way the film was developed, noting that [...] "We could imagine the pace and the unfolding of our film accurately with a relatively small expenditure of resources." [...] The group would gather in a screening room to view completed sequences, with Bird offering suggestions by drawing onto the screen with a marker. Lead animator Bazley suggested this led to a sense of camaraderie among the crew, who were unified in their mission to create a good film. Bird cited his favorite moment of the film's production as occurring in the editing room, when the crew gathered to test a sequence in which the Giant learns what a soul is. [...] "People in the room were spontaneously crying. It was pivotal; there was an undeniable feeling that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> tapping into something," [...] he recalled.|$|E
500|$|In mid-October 1965, the Beatles {{entered the}} {{recording}} studio; {{for the first}} time when making an album, they had an extended period without other major commitments. Until this time, according to George Martin, [...] "we had been making albums rather like a collection of singles. Now <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> beginning to think about albums as a bit of art on their own." [...] Released in December, Rubber Soul was hailed by critics as a major step forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. Their thematic reach was beginning to expand as they embraced deeper aspects of romance and philosophy. Biographers Peter Brown and Steven Gaines attribute the new musical direction to [...] "the Beatles' now habitual use of marijuana", an assertion confirmed by the band – Lennon referred to it as [...] "the pot album", and Starr said: [...] "Grass was really influential in a lot of our changes, especially with the writers. And because they were writing different material, we were playing differently." [...] After Help!s foray into the world of classical music with flutes and strings, Harrison's introduction of a sitar on [...] "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)" [...] marked a further progression outside the traditional boundaries of popular music. As their lyrics grew more artful, fans began to study them for deeper meaning. Of [...] "Norwegian Wood" [...] Lennon commented: [...] "I was trying to be sophisticated in writing about an affair... but in such a smokescreen way that you couldn't tell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{that will}} be much better than staying in Ashton doing nothing," [...] {{returned}} Dora. [...] "And, besides, <b>we</b> must <b>be</b> getting along on our trip. Dick says <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> a day behind in our schedule." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> {{going to}} build a house on my farm, {{an hour and a half}} from New York. It is decided. It is to be built by contract, and is to come within $25,000.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us drop those fellows and {{get back}} to this lost mine," [...] {{interrupted}} Phil. [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> going out to Montana we ought to make some sort of preparations for the trip." ...|$|R
