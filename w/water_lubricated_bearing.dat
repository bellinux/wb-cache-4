In calculations of oil <b>lubricated</b> <b>bearings</b> oil viscosity changes resulting from increasing temperature are usually taken into consideration. In <b>water</b> <b>lubricated</b> <b>bearings</b> the isothermal model is usually applied.

40|$|An {{important}} issue in hydropower and other industries {{is the increasing}} demand for introduction of environment friendly solutions. Mineral oil based lubricants have long been used in various sliding bearings in hydropower stations. Their use in aqueous environments however raises concerns about the environmental impact if they leak into downstream water. This has necessitated research in replacing mineral oils with more bio-degradable lubricants and {{the ultimate goal of}} ‘oil-free’ hydropower generating machines. Replacing oil with water however poses many challenges. Due to considerably lower viscosity of water compared to that of turbine oils, the <b>water</b> <b>lubricated</b> <b>bearings</b> are likely to operate in boundary/mixed lubrication regime for relatively longer period. Therefore choice of the materials and their tribological performance are very important for the bearings operating in the boundary/mixed lubrication regimes. Application of compliant polymers in <b>water</b> <b>lubricated</b> <b>bearings</b> introduces many advantages which cannot be achieved with coatings (DLC, etc.) or ceramics. Most previous tribological studies on polymers have been carried out in dry conditions and only a few studies in presence of water have been reported. This work is thus aimed at investigating the tribological behavior of some selected polymer materials in <b>water</b> <b>lubricated</b> conditions. The results of these studies provide an insight into polymers’ tribological performance in boundary/mixed and hydrodynamic lubrication regime and associated wear mechanisms in presence of water. Polymers also enhance performance of oil <b>lubricated</b> <b>bearings.</b> Application of polymers in the oil <b>lubricated</b> <b>bearings</b> provides a smooth transition from oil <b>lubricated</b> Babbitt <b>bearings</b> to <b>water</b> <b>lubricated</b> polymer <b>bearings.</b> Therefore a part of this thesis is also aimed at investigating the tribological characteristics of several polytetrafluoroethylene based materials at the onset of sliding (break-away friction) at different pressures and temperatures. The results of this study show significantly lower breakaway friction of PTFE materials compared to Babbitt at all pressures and temperatures. SEM investigations revealed wear modes of the PTFE materials and the abrasive nature of hard fillers. Bronze-filled, carbon-filled and pure PTFE were found to provide lower and more stable break-away friction and generally superior properties compared to the other materials.

The chapter details the theoretical analysis to determine both the static and dynamic characteristics,including the stability (using both the linearised perturbation method and the nonlinear transient analysis) of multiple axial groove <b>water</b> <b>lubricated</b> <b>bearings.</b> Experimental measurements and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations by the Tribology research group at Queensland University of Technology,Australia and Manipal Institute of Technology, India, have highlighted a significant gap in the understanding of the flow phenomena and pressure conditions within the lubricating fluid. An attempt has been made to present a CFD approach to model fluid flow in the bearing with three equi-spaced axial grooves and supplied with water from one end of the bearing. Details of the experimental method used to measure the film pressure in the bearing are outlined. The lubricant is subjected to a velocity induced flow (as the shaft rotates) and a pressure induced flow (as the water is forced from one end of the bearing to the other). Results are presented for the circumferential and axial pressure distribution in the bearing clearance for different loads, speeds and supply pressures. The axial pressure profile along the axial groove located in the loaded part of the bearing is measured. The theoretical analysis shows that smaller the groove angle better will be the load-carrying capacity and stability of these bearings.

40|$|The {{application}} of textured bearing surfaces {{results in a}} more complex lubricant flow pattern compared to smooth bearing surfaces. In order to capture the more complex flow pattern and possible inertia effects {{in the vicinity of}} the surface pockets, the NavierStokes equations should be used to model the flow between textured surfaces instead of the Reynolds equation. In this paper a multi-scale method is presented where the fluid flow in a single micro-scale texture unit cell is modelled using the NavierStokes equations, the results of which are then averaged to flow factors to be used in a novel texture averaged Reynolds equation on the macro-scale bearing level. Depending on the local flow conditions the non-linear inertia effects in the flow can either contribute or detract from the local load capacity of the lubricant film. Some results from the micro-scale calculations are presented, followed by the method developed to average these results to the macro-scale. The resulting flow-factors are presented and a load correction term is introduced.

40|$|This paper {{makes an}} {{interesting}} and informative con-tribution to the literature on <b>water</b> <b>lubricated</b> <b>bearings.</b> The low viscosity of water is apparently a disadvantage but this gives, together with a higher specific heat than most lubricants, very good cooling of the bearing. Since a principal feature of the spiral groove bearing is that the bearing tem-perature rise can be high, the use of <b>water</b> to <b>lubricate</b> such a <b>bearing</b> is an appropriate choice.

In this context, the relationship between Figs. 10 and 14 is not understood. If the distortion can be greatly reduced by appropriate support of the plate (Support A compared to solid type in Fig. 10), one would expect the non-dimensional load capacity (Fig. 14) to be considerably im-proved. In fact, the three curves for the experimental bearings in Fig. 14 are almost coincident. The experimental results of Fig. 8 show that the load capacity is relatively insensitive to groove depth.

40|$|The {{steady state}} {{characteristics}} of <b>water</b> <b>lubricated</b> journal <b>bearings</b> having multiple axial grooves are obtained theoretically.

The Reynolds equation is solved numerically by the finite difference method satisfying the Jacobsson- Floberg-Olsson boundary conditions. Experimental results indicate that the pressure remains constant for a major portion of the groove, while theory predicts a linear pressure drop from inlet to exit. Comparison of load capacity, attitude angle, volume flow rate and friction variable for various bearing number and eccentricity ratios, assuming linear pressure drop along the groove, shows that there is a significant difference between those obtained by the Reynolds model and the Jacobsson-Floberg-Olsson model.

40|$|A {{thrust bearing}} test rig {{experienced}} a catastrophic failure while operating with gas bearings. After many repairs, {{the test rig}} is in operating condition with water-lubricated bearings. Previous work details the failure and several initial repairs and modifications. Further modifications include manufacturing two rotors, repairing the main housing, aligning the motor shaft and test rotor, upgrading the water pipeline system, developing a static load system, installing instrumentation, and developing means of data acquisition. Presently, the revamped system has rotated to a speed of 5 krpm. Measurements of the free-free mode natural frequencies and lateral mode shapes of the rotor-coupling system show that the rotor and quill shaft operate as a unit. Once assembled, <b>water</b> <b>lubricates</b> the <b>bearings</b> to lift and support the test rotor connected to the motor through its coupling. Impact loads identify the system fundamental natural frequency and damping ratio for operation without rotor speed or active thrust bearings. The flexibility of the quill shaft commands {{the location of the}} system lateral natural frequency (~ 93 Hz) and its low damping ratio. XLTRC 2 ? based predictions agree well with the measured natural frequency and identified damping ratio. The <b>water</b> <b>lubricates</b> the radial <b>bearings</b> to lift the test rotor again as the motor accelerates the rotor to 5 krpm. During this operation, the rotor motion is synchronous and does not excite the first natural frequency. While operating at speeds up to 5 krpm, the system did not reach its first critical speed. Measurements show the thrust bearing axial clearance increases as the water supply pressure increases, max. 4. 14 bar(g), for operation with a constant axial load and at null or low rotor speed (3 krpm). As the imposed axial load increases, the operating clearance decreases exponentially. The decreasing operating clearance causes an increased flow resistance across the film lands, resulting in a reduced flow rate. As the flow rate decreases, there is a lower pressure drop across each orifice, resulting in an increase in recess pressure. The derived axial stiffness increases as the axial clearance decreases or the water supply pressure increases. XLHydroThrust? uses the thrust bearing geometry to generate predictions of thrust bearing performance. The predictions accurately describe the influence of the load and supply pressure on the thrust bearing performance; however, there are discrepancies between the magnitudes of the predictions and the magnitudes of the measurements at a high axial load (low axial clearance). The average percent difference between the predicted and measured magnitudes of supply flow rate, flow rate through inner diameter, axial clearance, and recess pressure ratio change from 2 % to 47 %, 7 % to 73 %, 25 % to 53 %, and 7 % to 18 %, respectively, as the applied axial load increases from its minimum to maximum magnitude. Thus, there is a significant increase in difference between the predicted and measured magnitudes as the applied axial load increases.

This study aims to exploit the EALs potential in boundary lubrication, especially in slow sliding journal bearings with shaft oscillation as those supporting the Kaplan turbine blades. In order to evaluate the performance of different lubricated environmentally adapted journal bearings a test rig was built. Many test rig parameters were set to simulate water turbine conditions. Tests were performed with different bearing and shaft materials and different lubricants suited for water turbine application, EALs, water with and the present used mineral oil reference. Additional lubricated tests in oscillating motion were conducted with a roller on disc and a pin on disc. All tests were performed with oscillating motion. The results showed that synthetic esters affect the contact material to a larger extent than the tested mineral oil.

This trend has allowed two types of nonoil <b>lubricated</b> <b>bearings</b> to grow in favor: 1) <b>bearings</b> <b>lubricated</b> by the process media and 2) magnetic bearings. The state-of-the-art in these different technologies is applied to pumps, is examined to identify what the current limits in the application of these technologies are. In the case of product <b>lubricated</b> <b>bearings,</b> the present mechanical limits, film thickness, and temperature limits, as related to different material and lubricant combinations, are reviewed by reference to bearing theory of operation and actual pump application. The role of various lubricant and material properties and mechanical design features are reviewed for these types of bearings. In addition, the importance of proper lubricant circulation and filtering is highlighted. The relationship of the above design parameters to specific load, speed, and temperature is examined to produce limiting operating envelopes for these types of bearings, similar to that previously developed for oil <b>lubricated</b> tilting pad <b>bearings.</b> Magnetic bearing applications completely circumvent the dry running and contamination issues raised by product <b>lubricated</b> <b>bearings</b> and offer unmatched capabilities in pump diagnostic. Space envelope and cost are usually not as favorable as product <b>lubricated</b> <b>bearings.</b> Limitations in operation of magnetic bearings are related to specific load, frequency, temperature, and system stability. The development of limiting envelopes of operation for magnetic bearings is presented to allow pump designers and end users to assess bearing load capacity vs frequency characteristics. Control of rotor and stator natural frequencies often demands special attention to any given application. In certain submerged bearing applications, corrosion considerations represent the most restrictive limitation in the application of magnetic bearings. In theory, almost any type of process fluid may be handled with magnetic bearings, and a growing variety of applications have already been successful...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{fabricated}} Acoustic Emission (AE) sensor using {{polyvinylidene fluoride}} (PVDF) film and its application for <b>lubricated</b> <b>bearing</b> monitoring on a rotodynamic machine are presented. The {{advantages of a}} PVDF sensor are not only flexibility in terms of complex shapes but also low acoustic impedance leading to efficient energy coupling and broad frequency range. The calibrated resonance frequency of the sensor is 38 kHz using an artificial AE source (number E 976 - 84) obtained from American Standard Testing Materials (ASTM). The experiment on a rotodynamic test rig at different machine conditions showed that the fabricated AE sensor can identify different machine operating conditions. Therefore, the fabricated AE sensor offers a potential alternative as a non-destructive monitor <b>lubricated</b> <b>bearings...</b>|$|R
