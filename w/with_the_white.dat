5|$|On January 15, 1927, the Senators traded Peckinpaugh to the Chicago White Sox for Leo Mangum and Sloppy Thurston. However, {{his playing}} time <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Sox was limited by a leg injury. He acted as an advisor to manager Ray Schalk. After one season <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Sox, Peckinpaugh {{retired as a}} player.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Sanford {{used his}} {{leverage}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House {{to expand the}} Research Triangle Park (RTP), which sparked an economic surge in the state, eventually luring IBM and the United States Environmental Protection Agency to the Triangle area.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1948 season, on December 2, the Indians traded Groth to the Chicago White Sox {{along with}} Bob Kuzava for Frank Papish. After signing a {{contract}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Sox, Groth took part in spring, training alongside many other newcomers to the White Sox, where his pitching performance earned him a place on the major league roster. He pitched in three games for the White Sox, losing one, and finished his tenure <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Sox with a 5.40 ERA in five innings pitched. After his final game on May 4, the White Sox purchased Ed Klieman and sold Groth to the Kansas City Blues, a New York Yankees minor league team, ending his major league career.|$|E

5|$|Latos {{suffered}} {{a knee injury}} in 2014, which reduced his effectiveness. The Marlins traded for Latos before the 2015 season and then traded him to the Dodgers in July 2015. He signed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Sox for 2016, but was released during the season, and finished the year with the Nationals. He appeared for the Blue Jays in 2017.|$|E
5|$|On July 18, 2017, the Yankees traded Clippard, Blake Rutherford, Ian Clarkin, and Tito Polo to the Chicago White Sox for David Robertson, Todd Frazier, and Tommy Kahnle. Clippard made 11 {{appearances}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Sox, earning two saves, and pitching to a 1.80 ERA.|$|E
5|$|There {{had been}} {{occasions}} when a President was incapacitated. For example, following Woodrow Wilson's stroke no one officially assumed the Presidential powers and duties, {{in part because}} the First Lady, Edith Wilson, together <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House Physician, Cary T.

5|$|A polar bear—the {{guardian}} of the ice wand—raises the ice wand from beneath the ocean. The fairies add an ice wand to each planet of the Solar System. Along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> wand at Fairy World, the ice wands create a celestial smile that projects its light into The Darkness. The smile transforms it into a bright sun, The Kindness, and Timmy concludes The Darkness was only looking for a friend. The group returns to Dimmsdale, where an Eliminator, dubbed a 'Hug'inator by Cosmo, crashes {{in front of them}} and spews out everyone who had been sucked in. Everyone parties in Fairy World and celebrates the chosen one's accomplishment.|$|E
5|$|A white dwarf's stellar and {{planetary}} system is inherited from its progenitor star and may interact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> dwarf in various ways. Infrared spectroscopic observations made by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope {{of the central}} star of the Helix Nebula suggest {{the presence of a}} dust cloud, which may be caused by cometary collisions. It is possible that infalling material from this may cause X-ray emission from the central star. Similarly, observations made in 2004 indicated the presence of a dust cloud around the young white dwarf G29-38 (estimated to have formed from its AGB progenitor about 500 million years ago), which may have been created by tidal disruption of a comet passing close to the white dwarf. Some estimations based on the metal content of the atmospheres of the white dwarfs consider that at least a 15% of them may be orbited by planets and/or asteroids, or at least their debris. Another suggested idea is that white dwarfs could be orbited by the stripped cores of rocky planets, that would have survived the red giant phase of their star but losing their outer layers and, given those planetary remnants would likely be made of metals, to attempt to detect them looking for the signatures of their interaction <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> dwarf's magnetic field.|$|E

5|$|After {{he retired}} from pitching, Ruffing stayed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Sox {{organization}} to instruct their players. The White Sox named Ruffing the manager of their Class A minor league affiliate, the Muskegon Clippers of the Central League, for the 1949 season. That season, the Clippers finished in fifth place out of six teams. In 1950, Ruffing managed the Daytona Beach Islanders of the Florida State League, a Cleveland Indians' affiliate.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} why France2, the Associated Press and Reuters did not film the scene {{directly}} after the shooting, including the {{shooting death of}} the ambulance driver who arrived to pick up Jamal and Muhammad. Abu Rahma's footage stops suddenly after the shooting of the father and son, then begins again—from the same position, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> minibus behind which Abu Rhama was standing visible in the shot—with other people being loaded into an ambulance.|$|E
5|$|Buckles did {{not meet}} the {{criteria}} for burial at Arlington National Cemetery as he had never been in combat, but friends and family secured special permission from the federal government in 2008.

5|$|Burnley did {{not play}} any {{pre-season}} friendly games other than a practice match between the first team and the reserves, which was watched by a crowd of around 10,000 at Turf Moor. The team's last competitive match had ended in a 0–2 defeat against Manchester United in the Lancashire Senior Cup on 8May 1920, almost four months earlier. The strip for 1920–21 was very little changed {{from that of the}} previous season; the claret jersey with light blue sleeves and a light blue stripe around the collar was kept along <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> shorts, but the claret socks were replaced by black.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{for food}} takes place mostly in fresh water, though the black stork may look for food {{on dry land}} at times. The black stork wades patiently and slowly in shallow water, often alone or in a small group if food is plentiful. It has been {{observed}} shading the water with its wings while hunting. In India, it often forages in mixed species flocks <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> stork, woolly-necked stork (Ciconia episcopus), demoiselle crane (Grus virgo) and bar-headed goose (Anser indicus). The black stork also follows large mammals such as deer and livestock, presumably to eat the invertebrates and small animals flushed by their presence.|$|E
5|$|Grove {{spent four}} more full seasons <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Sox, and after {{pitching}} one game in 1949, {{was sent to}} the Sacramento Solons of the Pacific Coast League. After playing four seasons with them, he formally retired from professional baseball. After retirement, he worked with his uncle in a trucking business in Chicago while continuing to pitch at the semi-pro level. In 1992, Grove {{died at the age of}} 72.|$|E
50|$|Thereafter, Niwot and his {{neighboring}} chief, Little Raven, who {{had recently}} welcomed <b>white</b> settlers to <b>the</b> Denver gold camp, maintained their stance of peaceful coexistence <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>whites.</b> <b>The</b> Arapaho chiefs were so welcoming that the newcomers named the first county in the territory after the tribe, as well as streets in both Denver and Boulder.|$|R
5000|$|His 1928 book Marcha para Oeste {{supported}} the frontier for being both anti-liberal and democratic. He held a hierarchical view {{of such a}} society <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>whites</b> holding [...] "the spirit of adventure and command".|$|R

5|$|However, in 2000, the Patriots {{also became}} one of the only teams to drop the rounded numbers and {{switched}} back to block numbers. Also that year, the shade of blue was darkened from royal to nautical blue. The Patriots, unsatisfied with the white-on-silver road look, also took the opportunity to introduce blue pants to be worn <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> jersey, offering a better contrast. To better match the blue pants, the number on the white jersey was switched from red to blue.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, DoD {{officials}} met <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House Military Office {{to discuss}} the program's future; the Pentagon had apparently wanted to terminate the VH-71 due to setbacks, budget issues, and design problems. The White House overruled a decision to cancel; the program was effectively placed on hold while options were considered. In July 2008, the VH-71A (also called Increment 1) was to reach operating capability in 2010. The {{second phase of the}} development, VH-71B (Increment 2) was expected to start entering service in 2017.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} year <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Sox, the Sounds {{clinched}} the Eastern Division title with an 81–62 record.
