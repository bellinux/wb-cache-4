50|$|When {{the need}} for {{improved}} harbour facilities for the handling of ships and cargoes became apparent, the Cape Government established harbour boards at Table Bay, Port Elizabeth and East London in 1847. Each board initially consisted of five members, later increased to seven. They {{were responsible for the}} management, control, improvement, development and maintenance of the facilities at these ports, and empowered to levy <b>wharfage</b> <b>dues.</b>|$|E
50|$|Early in its career {{the county}} {{suffered}} heavy setbacks. It assumed a liability of NZ£15,000 (being {{part of the}} Waiapu County's main road and bridges loan) and another of £1,200 {{in connection with the}} Te Araroa jetty. Anticipating that the <b>wharfage</b> <b>dues</b> that would be provided by a freezing works that had just been built at Hicks Bay would meet the loan charges, it borrowed £30,000 and built a wharf there. However, the works was closed after the 1925-6 season. By then, the county had also raised several small loans for road works.|$|E
50|$|PEZA offers both {{fiscal and}} non-fiscal {{incentives}} {{as well as}} ready-to-occupy business locations in world-class economic zones and IT parks or buildings. Fiscal incentives include: income tax holiday for {{a certain number of}} years, which translates to 100% exemption from corporate income tax; tax and duty-free importation of raw materials, capital equipment, machineries and spare parts; exemption from <b>wharfage</b> <b>dues</b> and export tax, impost or fees; VAT zero-rating of local purchases subject to compliance with BIR and PEZA requirements; exemption from payment of any and all local government imposts, fees, licenses or taxes; and exemption from expanded withholding tax. Non-fiscal incentives, on the other hand include simplified import-export procedures, extended visa facilitation assistance to foreign nationals and spouses and dependents; special visa multiple entry privileges; and more.|$|E
5000|$|The main mode of {{transport}} in the area was originally by water. Farmers' ships sailed up the coast into Botany Bay, and up the Georges and Woronora rivers, avoiding the <b>wharfage</b> and custom <b>dues</b> at Port Jackson. The first public road, the Illawarra Road (now called the Old Illawarra Road) to the [...] "Five Islands" [...] (now Wollongong), was constructed between 1842 and 1845 with convict labour. A new southern line of road was completed in 1864, linking up with the Illawarra Road at Engadine. Today this virtually is {{the line of the}} Princes Highway, the main north-south thoroughfare through Sutherland Shire.|$|R
5000|$|... "The gold-dust robbery of 1839, {{the first}} of its kind, was cleverly and {{carefully}} planned with the assistance of a dishonest employee. A young man named Caspar Casper, clerk to a steam-ship company, learnt through the firm's correspondence that a quantity of gold-dust brought in a man-of-war from Brazil had been transhipped at Falmouth for conveyance to London. The letter informed him of the marks and sizes of the cases containing the precious metal, and he with his father Casper arranged that a messenger should call for the stuff with forged credentials, and anticipating the rightful owner. The fraudulent messenger, by the help of young Caspar, established his claim to the boxes, paid the <b>wharfage</b> <b>dues,</b> and carried off the gold-dust. Presently the proper person arrived from the consignees, but found the gold-dust gone.|$|E
40|$|The {{authorised}} Edition of the Statute Law of the Colony, {{covering the}} period 1652 - 1895, revised by Mr. Advocate Tennant and myself in 1895, having Been for some considerable {{time out of}} print and unobtainable, the opportunity has been deemed favourable for issuing a reprint revised {{to the end of}} the Session of 1905. The text of the Ordinances and Acts has been carefully read; all enactments repealed by legislation subsequent to 1895 have been omitted, explanatory footnotes having been added where necessary; and all Acts re-enacted have been re-printed. The arrangement, under which the paging of the Sessional Acts passed after 1895 was made continuous, has not been disturbed, so that the use of this Edition in the Courts will not create confusion as would be the case if the paging differed. To quote an example. The Charter of. Justice will be found printed on pages 93 - 108 in both Editions. The Act 21 of 1864 amending it occupies pages 948 - 955 of the 1895 Edition, but in view of its repeal is not printed in this Edition, a note to that effect appearing' on page 947, the number of the page (956) following, corresponding with the 1895 Edition. This Edition consists of four volumes, the first three containing the text of the Acts, and the last a full Chronological Table with an entirely new Index completed {{to the end of the}} Session of 1905.
