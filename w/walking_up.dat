5|$|As {{the singer}} walks through a forest, {{the father is}} shown resorting to {{drinking}} in grief. A funeral scene follows, showing the girl <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> to her mother's wake. When she sees her mother's lips sealed with thread, she runs away from the wake. Madonna walks through a house, where shadows show the girl being scolded and shouted at by the father. Ultimately she walks to the graveyard and stands beside an old man, implying that she herself is the little girl portrayed. The video ends with the little girl dancing {{in front of her}} mother's grave as snow falls around her.|$|E
5|$|Following the lyrics, {{the second}} video {{starts with the}} quartet {{in the front of}} the aeroplane, with Spencer as the captain. The video {{continues}} with all of the members as stewards <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> and down the plane, with a cameo appearance from Sister Mary McArthur, who was invited to take part after the band saw her lip sync video. Later in the video each member of the band is seen dancing in front of the flags of selected countries that are all participating in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007, in addition to the flag of the European Union.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Criss Angel {{became the}} creator, director, and {{executive}} producer of the A Network show Criss Angel Mindfreak, and had entered production in January. Seasons 1 and 2 were filmed at The Aladdin in Las Vegas, with Season 3 at the Luxor Las Vegas. Premiering on July 20, 2005, the show's illusions included walking on water, levitating, <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> the side of Luxor Hotel (in the light of 39 focused lamps that can be seen from space), floating between two buildings, causing a Lamborghini to disappear, surviving in an exploding C4 Crate, cutting himself in half in full view of an audience and getting run over by a steamroller while lying on a bed of broken glass.|$|E

5|$|The song's {{alternate}} video {{features a}} similar synopsis, where Houston begins singing the song {{on a large}} stone altar {{in the middle of}} an auditorium. As she finishes her verse, Carey is seen <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> the ramp in the background, joining Houston for her verse. They continue singing the song together, standing side by side and holding hands. After completing the song, both singers exit the auditorium together as in the first video, simulating two friends enjoying time with each other. Both videos are very similar, only the alternate version does not feature an audience, choir or images, only the duo singing together atop the stone altar. In this version of the video, Houston wears a long brown strapless gown, and features a shoulder length bob haircut. Carey on the otherhand, features long cascading curls and dons an olive green gown.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, the LISPC {{approved}} $37,000 (1947USD) {{to construct}} a stone ornate gasoline station along the Meadowbrook in Jones Beach State Park. The gas station, one of eight constructed by Robert Moses throughout Long Island, would serve drivers, when there were fewer stations throughout the area. After 1975, NYSDOT, who {{took control of the}} parkways from the LISPC, started demolishing some of the stations, including the Meadowbrook, which ended up being one of the first buildings to go. The stations, which were once useful, would fork from the left lane into the median. However, according to NYSDOT, with the change in traffic patterns, the entrances to these stations became dangerous. By 1997, over two decades after demolition, the station site became a problematic place for people parking and <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> the Meadowbrook and Loop to fish on the bridges. According to the New York State Police, the site is legal for use as a repair stop or for emergencies. However, not for use of dropping people off for fishing, which is also illegal to fish from atop the bridge, except it is around and under the bridges.|$|E
5|$|Norfolk Coast Path, {{an ancient}} long {{distance}} footpath, cuts {{across the south}} eastern corner of the reserve along the sea wall between the farmland and the salt marshes, and further west at Holme-next-the-Sea the trail joins Peddars Way. The tip of Blakeney Point {{can be reached by}} <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> the shingle spit from the car park at Cley Beach, or by boats from the quay at Morston. The boat gives good views of the seal colonies and avoids the long walk over a difficult surface. The National Trust has an information centre and tea room at the quay, and a visitor centre on the Point. The centre was formerly a lifeboat station and is open in the summer months. Halfway House, or the Watch House, is a building 2.4km (1.5mi) from Cley Beach car park. Originally built in the 19th century as a look-out for smugglers, it was used in succession as a coast guard station, by the Girl Guides, and as a holiday let.|$|E

5|$|Quatre Bras was a hamlet at a {{strategic}} crossroads {{on the road}} to Brussels. French control of it would not only threaten the city, but divide Wellington's allied army from Blucher's Prussians. At 14:00 on 16 June 1815, after some initial skirmishing, the main French force under Marshall Ney, approached Quatre Bras from the south. They came up against the 2nd Netherlands Division who had formed a line well in advance of the crossroads. Facing three French infantry divisions and a cavalry brigade, the Dutch and Nassau troops were forced back but did not break. Reinforcements arrived at 15:00, being a Dutch cavalry brigade, Picton's 5th British Division, followed closely by the Brunswick Corps. The sharpshooters of the Brunswick Advance Guard regiment were sent to support Dutch skirmishers in Bossou Wood on the allied right (western) flank; the rest of the corps took up a reserve position across the Brussels road. The Duke reassured his inexperienced troops by <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> and down in front of them, calmly puffing on his pipe.|$|E
5|$|Radau summarises one {{passage from}} the book after another: the orang utans of Borneo wrestling open the jaws of a crocodile, or killing a python; the Timorese <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> tall trees, leaning back on ropes as they pull {{themselves}} upwards; the indescribable taste of a durian fruit, at once recalling custard, almond paste, roasted onions, sherry {{and a host of}} other things, that melts on the tongue, that one does not want to stop eating; more, the fruit has a repulsive odour, and the tree is dangerous, as the hard and heavy fruits can fall on your head. Radau follows Wallace up to the high plateaux of Java, where there are cypress forests covered in moss and lichen; finally at the summit the vegetation seems European, an island vegetation recalling the resemblance between the plants of the high Alps and of Lapland. And in Celebes, men run amok, generally killing a dozen people before meeting their own death.|$|E
25|$|When <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> {{the steps}} to The Gap at Watsons Bay, there is flat ground in between two sets of steps. This {{continues}} for a fair way in both directions, and is the old tram right of way.|$|E

25|$|On 17 September 2011, 1,000 protesters {{gathered}} in downtown Manhattan <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> and down Wall Street. About 100 to 200 people stayed overnight in Zucotti Park, two blocks north of Wall Street. By 19 September, seven {{people had been}} arrested.|$|E
25|$|During the car chase with Paz, Bourne's car is {{destroyed}} {{in a similar}} fashion to Kirill's in the climax of The Bourne Supremacy. The sequence also includes similar staging, such as Bourne <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> to Paz with gun in hand but deciding not to shoot.|$|E
25|$|Kilkee {{is popular}} with walkers as {{different}} routes stretch out {{in every direction}} from the bay. The most popular walk is the cliff walk, which involves <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> the Dunlicky Road and then turning right onto the cliffs by Intrinsic Bay, following the path until you eventually {{end up at the}} Pollack Holes.|$|E

25|$|Running {{water is}} {{available}} {{in many parts of}} the country, but most villages remain without it. Women in remote areas typically draw water from the nearest well or from a cistern, sometimes <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> to two hours each way twice a day. They may carry the water in pots on their heads or load them onto donkeys.|$|E
25|$|Thousands of {{tourists}} walk the Inca Trail to visit Machu Picchu each year. They congregate at Cusco before starting on the one-, two-, four- or five-day journey on foot from Kilometer 82 (or 77 or 85, four/five-day trip) or Kilometer 104 (one/two-day trip) {{near the town}} of Ollantaytambo in the Urubamba valley, <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> through the Andes to the isolated city.|$|E
25|$|CSS Shenandoah {{had struck}} her colors twice. This marked the last {{surrender}} of the American Civil War {{and the last}} official lowering of the Confederate flag. The very last act of the Civil War was Captain Waddell <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> the steps of Liverpool Town Hall with a letter {{to present to the}} mayor surrendering his vessel to the British government. In so doing, the Shenandoah became the only Confederate warship to circumnavigate the globe.|$|E

25|$|During its working life, packet boats {{provided}} an express passenger service between Preston and Lancaster, {{and later to}} Kendal at , with passengers <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> or down the flight of locks at Tewitfield and embarking on a second boat. The seven-hour journey time halved the best speeds of stage coaches; because of {{the comfort of the}} journey, passengers stayed loyal to the packet boats even after the advent of railway competition in the 1840s.|$|E
25|$|A corset dress (also {{known as}} hobble corset because it {{produces}} similar restrictive effects to a hobble skirt) {{is a long}} corset. It is like an ordinary corset, but it is long {{enough to cover the}} legs, partially or totally. It thus looks like a dress, hence the name. A person wearing a corset dress can have great difficulty in <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> and down the stairs (especially if wearing high-heeled footwear) and may be unable to sit down if the boning is too stiff.|$|E
25|$|The {{signalling}} system at Liss Forest was single line telephone and ticket. The block man wrote out the ticket {{even though the}} work train was still in section. The ticket was exchanged for the one engine in steam key which controlled the section from Liss Forest to Liss. This saved the block man the trip of <b>walking</b> <b>up</b> the platform with the ticket after the work train had cleared. It was a misty day and the passenger train armed with the ticket passed the signal at red which then led to the fatal crash.|$|E
