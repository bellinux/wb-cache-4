Menzies was deeply distressed and abandoned his normally impassive demeanour to announce in a halting subdued voice:It is my very sorrowful duty during this celebration tonight {{to tell you that}} Mr Chifley has died. I don't want to try to talk about him now because, although we were political opponents, he was a friend of mine and yours, and a fine Australian. You will all agree that in the circumstances the festivities should end. It doesn't matter about party politics on an occasion such as this. Oddly enough, in Parliament we get on very well. <b>We</b> <b>sometimes</b> find we have the warmest friendships among people whose politics are not ours. Mr Chifley served this country magnificently for years.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} vernacular children's {{songs in}} Europe are lullabies from the later medieval period. From soon {{after we have}} records of short children's rhyming songs, but most nursery rhymes were not written down until the 18th century. The first English collections were Tommy Thumb's Song Book and a sequel, Tommy Thumb's Pretty Song Book, are both {{thought to have been}} published before 1744, and John Newbery's, Mother Goose's Melody, or, Sonnets for the Cradle (c.1785), is the first record we have of many classic rhymes. These rhymes seem to have come from a variety of sources, including traditional riddles, proverbs, ballads, lines of Mummers' plays, drinking songs, historical events, and, it has been suggested, ancient pagan rituals. Roughly half of the current body recognised 'traditional' English rhymes were known by the mid-18th century. From this period <b>we</b> <b>sometimes</b> know the origins and authors of rhymes, like 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star', which combined an 18th-century French tune with a poem by English writer Jane Taylor and 'Mary Had a Little Lamb', written by Sarah Josepha Hale of Boston in 1830. The first, and possibly the most important collection to focus in this area was, James Orchard Halliwell's, The Nursery Rhymes of England (1842) and Popular Rhymes and Tales in 1849. At the height of the revival Sabine Baring-Gould produced A Book of Nursery Songs (1895), and Andrew Lang produced The Nursery Rhyme Book in 1897. Children's songs, unlike folk songs, have remained part of a living and continuous tradition, for although added to from other sources and affected by written versions, most adults pass on songs they learned from oral sources as children.|$|E

[...] Sadier continued, [...] "Our dedication to her on the album [...] says, 'We will love you till the end', meaning of our lives. I'm not religious, but I feel Mary's energy is still around somewhere. It didn't just disappear." [...] The Observers Molloy Woodcraft awarded the album four out of five stars, and described Sadier's vocal performance as [...] "life- and love-affirming", and the record as a whole as [...] "Complex and catchy, bold and beatific." [...] Kelefa Sanneh argued in Rolling Stone that Margerine Eclipse was [...] "full of familiar noises and aimless melodies". Margerine Eclipse was Stereolab's last record to be released on American label Elektra Records, which shut down that same year. Future material would be released on Too Pure, the same label which had released some of the band's earliest material.|$|E

[...] Rihanna then shows her dressing room, makeup artists and costumes. She explains how she loves wearing black on stage because she is [...] "good girl gone bad and black is kind of gothic and rock n' roll". Rihanna explains how she is nervous before the beginning of the show because of the atmosphere where all of her fans are screaming her name.

500|$|During the concert, Davis {{directed}} approximately 50 stops or {{breaks to}} the band, particularly the rhythm section, by gesturing {{with his head}} or hand. These stops served as dramatic turning points in the tension-release structure of the performances, changing their tempo and allowing the band to alternate between quiet passages and intense climaxes. He also interjected the performances with drone washes from his Yamaha organ, achieving a [...] "strange, nearly perverse presence" [...] that Mikal Gilmore believed [...] "defined the temper" [...] of the music. Lucas said Davis applied a feel for dynamics he had developed earlier in his career playing jazz but with a greater array of contrasts, including atonal, dissonant chords, and his own bebop trumpet playing set against the group's funk rhythms. [...] "Extreme textures and extreme volume", Lucas explained, [...] "were as much part of the palette as the contrasting chord and rhythmic structures. Being equipped like a full rock band, <b>we</b> <b>sometimes</b> literally blew the walls out." [...] During the [...] "Tatu" [...] and [...] "Agharta Prelude" [...] segments, Davis abruptly stopped and started the septet several times to shift tempos by playing a dissonant, cacophonous organ figure, giving Cosey space to generate eccentric, psychedelic figures and effects. The main theme for [...] "Tatu" [...] had been played at a slower tempo when Cosey first joined the band, but they played it faster as their rapport grew, especially {{by the time of}} the Japanese tour. Cosey credited Davis with having the ability to [...] "transmit thoughts and ideas" [...] to the soloists with his playing.|$|E
500|$|February was a busy {{month for}} the club. Benfica trailed Porto by 11 points in the Primeira Liga, with crucial European and {{domestic}} cup matches between league matches. The first was on 2 February against Nacional. Like past home performances, Benfica failed to score and lost points in another scoreless draw. Camacho tried to explain his team's performance: [...] "We did not lack attitude, but at home, <b>we</b> <b>sometimes</b> feel disturbed, pressured. We played two forwards and we still did not score." [...] He saw his first white handkerchiefs, an action commonly seen as a request for resignation. Benfica regained their feet with a home win against Paços de Ferreira in the Portuguese Cup. An opening goal by Pedrinha in the second minute was answered with an equaliser by Cardozo before half-time. In the second half, Cardozo, Rui Costa and Nuno Assis scored to send Benfica to the quarter-finals. On 14 February, Benfica hosted 1. FC Nürnberg {{in the first of}} two games against the German team. Recent acquisition Ariza Makukula scored the only goal in the 43rd minute, a 20-meter strike which fooled goalkeeper Jaromír Blažek. Camacho called the narrow victory important. Three days later, Benfica played Naval at the Municipal José Bento Pessoa. Cristian Rodríguez scored the club's opening goal in the 18th minute, with László Sepsi assisting Nuno Assis on a second goal in the final minute. On 21 February, Benfica played the second leg of their European double-header with Nürnberg. The Bundesliga side scored twice in seven minutes during the second half before Cardozo scored in the 89th minute and Di María tied the game in the 92nd, sending Benfica to the round of 16 with Spanish side Getafe. Camacho said, [...] "Benfica made some defensive errors in the second half that put them in a though spot. They managed to react and continued their search for goals until they arrived." [...] In domestic-league play, Benfica hosted Braga on 24 January. Braga scored first with a fifth-minute goal by Zé Manel, with Luisão tying the game in the 21sth minute. The draw complicated the league race, with Porto increasing their lead. Camacho said, [...] "Benfica did everything they could win. They tried to score from every way possible, but could not". The club ended the month with a 2–0 victory over Moreirense in the Portuguese Cup, sending them to the semi-finals.|$|E
