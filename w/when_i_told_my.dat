6000|$|I {{was very}} tired, and slept until noon, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> story to Haldane and his {{daughter}} together. The former made very few comments, but presently I came upon Lucille alone, and laid my {{hand on her shoulder}} as I said: [...] "Do you know that somebody suggested it was I who burned Gaspard's Trail?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can't argufy with jealous people, and you can't shame 'em. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> missis {{once that}} I should never {{dream of being}} jealous of her, instead of up and thanking me for it, she spoilt the best frying-pan we ever had. When the widder-woman next-door but two and me 'ad rheumatics at the same time, she went and asked the doctor whether it was catching.|$|E

6000|$|... 'You {{will think}} so still more {{when you see}} this note, which he sent open, inside mine, {{to be given to}} papa <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> <b>my</b> own story. Oh, his considerateness for me!' ...|$|R
60|$|At length Don Policarpo returned, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him <b>my</b> {{story he}} laughed slightly, but said nothing. In the evening I {{reminded}} him of the subject of the letter I had brought from Montevideo, asking him whether it was his intention to give me some employment on the estancia.|$|R
60|$|The {{young couple}} {{were out in}} the porch, looking at the moon. They greeted me heartily, but their heartiness had rather a tinny sound, and I could see that on the whole they {{regarded}} me as one of those things which should not happen. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> story their attitude changed. They began to look on me in the pleasanter light of a guardian, philosopher, and friend.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was, Mysa; and I {{thought at}} first, as you did, that {{although}} it {{was the result of}} an accident the anger of the gods would be poured out against me, that I was as one accursed, whose life was forfeited in this world, and whose spirit was destined to dwell in unclean beasts after death. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> father all, he reassured me, and told me not to fear in any way the wrath of the gods." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For the blackbeetles. There's {{nothing like}} a {{hedgehog}} for beetles. It will eat blackbeetles till it's sick, till it dies of surfeit. That {{reminds me of the}} time <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> poor great master Haydon--in joke, of course--that he ought to send in a cartoon of King John dying of a surfeit of lampreys for the frescoes in the new Houses of Parliament. As I told him, it's a most notable event in the annals of British liberty--the providential and exemplary removal of a tyrant." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was more}} than one pale face among the women and younger {{children}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> of <b>my</b> father's death, and I dare say but few would have remained to build homes nearabout the Ohio River if it had been possible for them {{to get back to the}} settlement they had just left.|$|R
6000|$|... "Old Miller, {{who really}} {{began to take}} some pride in me, was confounded when he {{understood}} that I {{did not intend to}} go to Bob Mosely's; but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him <b>my</b> misfortune, and that I had no dress: 'By the powers,' cried he, 'but you shall go, and you shall be the best dressed and the best mounted lad there!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One more request. I beg {{that you}} will not forget what you promised me, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you <b>my</b> foolish fancy about the green flag. Wherever you go, let Mary's keepsake go with you. No written answer is necessary--I would rather not receive it. Look up, when you leave the house to-morrow, at the center window over the doorway--that will be answer enough." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was little}} more than a boy; and I went home that night more puzzled and more frightened than I have ever been, before or since, in the woods. I ran into the doctor's office on my way. He found three cuts in my scalp, and below them two shorter ones, where pointed things seemed to have been driven through to the bone. He looked at me queerly <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> story. Of course he did not believe me, and I made no effort to persuade him. Indeed, I {{scarcely}} believed myself. But for the blood which stained my handkerchief, and the throbbing pain in my head, I should have doubted the reality of the whole experience.|$|E
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> {{wife that}} I had caught three burglars, {{and they were}} fast bound in the library, she nearly fainted; and when I had revived her she begged me to promise that I would not go downstairs again until the police had carried away the horrible wretches. But I assured {{her that it was}} {{absolutely}} necessary for me to return to the library. She then declared that she would go with me, and if anything happened she would share my fate. [...] "Besides," [...] she said, [...] "if they are tied fast so they can't move, I should like to see what they look like. I never saw a burglar." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> {{friends that}} I {{was going on}} this mission to Ireland they shook their heads, but said nothing to dissuade me. I think {{it must have been}} evident to all who were my friends that my life in London was not a success. My mother and elder brother were at this time abroad, and were not consulted;--did not even know my {{intention}} in time to protest against it. Indeed, I consulted no one, except a dear old cousin, our family lawyer, from whom I borrowed 200 to help me out of England. He lent me the money, and looked upon me with pitying eyes--shaking his head. [...] "After all, you were right to go," [...] he said to me when I paid him the money a few years afterwards.|$|E
6000|$|... "The last time," [...] says she, [...] "that I had the {{pleasure}} of seeing you, in the garden, you asked me why <b>I</b> leave Newstead; <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you <b>my</b> circumstances obliged me, the expression of concern which I fancied I observed in your look and manner would have encouraged me to have been explicit at the time, but from my inability of expressing myself verbally." ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{skin was}} like a {{delicate}} white rose leaf, and <b>when</b> she spoke <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> foolish self that never had I heard music before; nor do I ever again think to hear a voice so sweet, so liquid, as that which rippled over her ripe lips.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you {{can only}} answer me in that tone I will make an end of it at once. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you of <b>my</b> engagement, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you also that another woman possessed my heart. Am I wrong to suppose that you knew to whom I alluded?" ...|$|R
60|$|In the evening, in the smoking-room, {{it was no}} better, {{nobody had}} ever heard of an omen in this {{particular}} castle. Nay, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> story, for it came to that at last, they only laughed at me, and said I must have dreamed it. Of course I expected to be wakened in the night by some awful apparition, but nothing disturbed me. I never slept better, and hearses were the last things I thought of during the remainder of my visit. Months passed, and I had almost forgotten the vision, or dream, for I began to feel apprehensive that, after all, it was a dream. So costly and elaborate an apparition as a hearse with white horses and plumes complete, could never have been got up, regardless of expense, for one occasion only, and to frighten one undergraduate, yet it was certain that the hearse was not 'the old family coach.' My entertainers had undeniably never heard of it in their lives before. Even tradition at the castle said nothing of a spectral hearse, though the house was credited with a white lady deprived of her hands, and a luminous boy.|$|E

Did I lie <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> mother that in these days a man does not always mention {{marriage}} when he asks a girl to be his wife? You said you loved me, and I believed you, and the rest was a thing of course. And you meant it. You know you meant it. When you held me in your arms in the carriage you know you meant me to suppose that it would always be so. Then the fear of your sister came upon you, and of your sister's husband,--and you ran away! I wonder whether you think yourself a man!" [...] And yet {{she felt that she}} had not hit him yet. He was wretched enough; and she {{could see that he was}} wretched;--but the wretchedness would pass away as soon as she was gone. How could she stab him so that the wound would remain? With what virus could she poison her arrow, so that the agony might be prolonged? [...] "And such a coward too! I began to suspect it when you started that night from Mistletoe,--though I did not think then that you could be all mean, all cowardly. From that day to this, you have not dared to speak a word of truth. Every word has been a falsehood." ...|$|E

[...] "There was a family row about boxing but nothing like the battle <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> father I {{was going to be}} an actor.

6000|$|He {{was amazed}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him of <b>my</b> plan to start, in April, for the Yukon, and {{in answer to}} his {{question}} I said, [...] "I need an expedition of heroic sort to complete my education, and to wash the library dust out of my brain." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the meantime, we {{felt the}} lack of a rabbinical leader in Aix-les-Bains. And so when we heard of a Rabbi Rubinstein in nearby Lyon, I went with Dr. Hillel Seidman to visit him. When we entered Rabbi Rubinstein's home, his wife greeted us. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> her <b>my</b> name and that I came from Warsaw, she said to me, [...] "Wait a moment, please", and stepped out. A minute later, she {{returned}} and showed me to Rabbi Rubinstein's room.|$|R

They had {{told me about the}} staircase at the inn. I forget what it is exactly, but it's something rather special in staircases.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Growing up in Sydney, Mozgawa {{was raised}} by her Polish parents, who had moved from Poland to Australia to perform music {{together}} as a musical duo. Regarding her musical family, Mozgawa noted: [...] "It would have been totally unnatural for me to not play an instrument in the family. That said, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> mum I wanted to play drums, she was like, 'No fuckin' way!' We managed to sort things out after that though".|$|E
5000|$|... "This was {{the first}} time I heard this sound, but I felt as though I had always heard it within me, as though it were my own inner voice. I had chills, and I knew {{definitively}} that I had to quit the saz, and start playing this new instrument. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> father about this, he was very moved. As it turns out, my great grandfather was a kamancheh player in Dagestan." [...] Eliyahu on the beginning of his careerInterview with Boulderjewishnews ...|$|E
5000|$|He {{made the}} {{move in the}} hope to {{represent}} Scotland. He stated: [...] "After being sidelined for two years because of a serious knee injury, I {{made up my mind}} to continue my career in Europe. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> agent about my family background, he set about getting me fixed up with a Scottish team. The ultimate goal for any player is to play at international level and as soon as I found out that I could be eligible for Scotland, my sights were set." ...|$|E
6000|$|Reggie Nettlecraft {{had grown}} up into an unwholesome, spotty, {{indeterminate}} young man, with a speckled necktie, and cuffs {{of which he was}} inordinately proud, and which he insisted on [...] "flashing" [...] every second minute. He was also evidently self-satisfied; which was odd, for I have seldom seen anyone who afforded less cause for rational satisfaction. [...] "Hullo," [...] he said, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him <b>my</b> name. [...] "So it's you, is it, Cumberledge?" [...] He glanced at my card. [...] "St. Nathaniel's Hospital! What rot! Why, blow me tight if you haven't turned sawbones!" ...|$|R
60|$|Thus {{she spoke}} most sweetly, {{looking at me}} the while with her clear and earnest eyes, that I ever fancied must be such as adorn the shining faces of angels. Ay, and those same eyes of hers were filled with tears <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> her <b>my</b> bitter grief {{over the death of}} my firstborn and of my other bereavements. For it was not till some years afterwards, when she had {{abandoned}} further hope of children, that Lily grew jealous of those dead sons of mine and of my ever present love for them.|$|R
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him of <b>my</b> catechist, {{he shook}} his head, and said I was lucky to have got clear off. [...] "That is a very {{dangerous}} man," [...] he said; [...] "Duncan Mackiegh is his name; he can shoot by the ear at several yards, and has been often accused of highway robberies, and once of murder." ...|$|R
50|$|Charles Lewinsky, {{creator of}} Fascht e Familie, recalls that she played every summer the Chaschperli in Zürich, {{followed}} by appearances in films, television series {{and in the}} Bernhard Theater. At the age of 80, she still {{played a role in}} his play 'Huusfründe'. He remembers the long conversations with Trudi Roth: It was impossible, to talk briefly with Trudi. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> wife, now I call on Trudi she said: 'I'll see you in an hour'. Trudi Roth was Charles Lewinsky sympathetic at the first co-operation, above all to have the gift of the gab.|$|E
5000|$|Upon the album's CD {{release in}} 2003, writer Ellis Widner {{noted that the}} {{original}} release came at {{a point at which}} [...] "Mathis knew it was time to refresh his music and renew his career. It had been four years since his last hit" [...] on the Billboard Hot 100 (1969's number 96 entry, [...] "Love Theme from Romeo and Juliet (A Time for Us)"). Bell was fresh off of a series of hits with The Delfonics, The Stylistics, and The Spinners. [...] "Following several smashes on both the pop and R&B charts, Bell was ready to approach what he calls 'the sterling of sterling: Mathis. I kept hearing Mathis in my mind. You work hard reaching that pinnacle to work with him. And that’s what I did. I worked as hard as I could.

5000|$|When Bemrose wrote [...] "Insecurity," [...] {{which is}} {{featured}} on the [...] "Heart on Fire" [...] EP, the band began looking for a female singer that could compliment his vocals. Soon thereafter, Nova was at home playing The Cure's [...] "Friday I'm in Love" [...] while his visiting schoolmate, Aimee Driver, was making {{a cup of tea}} and chimed in with the lyrics. [...] "I just started singing along when Nova rushed in seeming really shocked," [...] Driver recalls. [...] "I thought his dad had a heart attack or something! He made me stand there in his living room and sing to him - which was the scariest thing ever at the time. At first I wouldn’t do it, but he wouldn't shut up so I just put my tea down, shut my eyes and sang...just to stop him pestering me. Danny recorded me on 'Insecurity.' The next thing I knew I was in the band. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>my</b> family and friends they were saying, ‘but you can't sing, can you?’" [...] Before joining the band, Driver had never performed in public.|$|E
60|$|I endeavoured {{to reason}} {{myself out of}} it, {{but it was in}} vain; the {{impression}} lay so strong on my mind, that {{it was not to be}} resisted. At last it came as an addition to my new design of going into the country, that it would be an excellent blind to my old governess, and would cover entirely all my other affairs, for she did not know in the least whether my new lover lived in London or in Lancashire; and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> her <b>my</b> resolution, she was fully persuaded it was in Lancashire.|$|R

'Stick to the trumps, however, my lad,' {{he would}} say, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him of <b>my</b> misfortunes in the {{conjugal}} line, and how near I had been winning the greatest fortune in Germany.
