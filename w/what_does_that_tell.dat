6000|$|... "Any one {{who goes}} to the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, may see two large and {{beautiful}} pictures--the nearer of the two labelled 'Titian,' representing Bacchus leaping from a car drawn by leopards. The other, labelled 'Francia,' representing the Holy Family seated on a sort of throne, with several figures arranged below--one of them a man pierced with arrows. Between these two, low down, hangs a small picture, about two feet square, containing only the portrait of an old man, in a white cap and robe, and labelled on the picture itself, 'Joannes Bellinus.' Now this old man is a very ancient friend of mine, and has comforted my heart, and preached me a sharp sermon, too, many a time. I never enter that gallery without having five minutes' converse with him; and yet he has been dead at least three hundred years, and, what is more, I don't even know his name. But what more do I know of a man by knowing his name? Whether the man's name be Brown, or whether he has as many names and titles as a Spanish grandee, <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>tell</b> me about the man?--the spirit and character of the man--what the man will say when he is asked--what the man will do when he is stirred up to action? The man's name {{is part of his}} clothes; his shell; his husk. Change his name and all his titles, you don't change him--'a man's a man for a' that,' as Burns says; and a goose a goose. Other men gave him his name; but his heart and his spirit--his love and his hatred--his wisdom and his folly--his power to do well and ill; those God and himself gave him. I must know those, and then I know the man. Let us see what we can make out from the picture itself about the man whom it represents. In the first place, we may see by his dress that he was in his day the Doge (or chief magistrate) of Venice--the island city, the queen of the seas. So we may guess that he had many a stirring time of it, and many a delicate game to play among those tyrannous and covetous old merchant-princes who had elected him; who were keeping up their own power at the expense of everyone's liberty, by spies and nameless accusers, and secret councils, tortures, and prisons, whose horrors no one ever returned to describe. Nay, we may guess just the very men with whom he had to deal--the very battles he may have seen fought.|$|E

40|$|This thesis uses regime {{theory and}} the English School of International Relations (and {{particularly}} the social constructivist reformulation by Buzan in From International to World Society: English School Theory and the Social Structure of Globalisation 2004) to address the question: Why have actors decided to cooperate on outer space issues, and <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> cooperation <b>tell</b> us about wider international politics and international society. Rational actors have at times determined {{that it is in}} their interest to coordinate activity for outer space. This coordination has led (either intentionally or unintentionally) to the creation of international regimes, and those regimes have conversely come to exert influence over actors' interests and behavior over time. Processes within international society (such as the rise, evolution, and decline of international society institutions, and shifts between pluralism and solidarism) also influence - and are influenced by - outer space politics. The thesis focuses on five case studies: geosynchronous orbit, the International Space Station, Global Navigational Satellite Systems, the company Sea Launch, and comets and asteroids. Pre-existing outer space treaties ("diffuse regimes") have established basic understandings between states about governance over outer space, and implicit or explicit regimes have also evolved to facilitate coordination amongst actors on the specific issue-areas of each case study. The tools used by regime theorists help explain the development of these various regimes and the relationship between them; however, because of regime theory's relatively narrow focus (on actors' rational interests in specific issue-areas) it provides few insights into how outer space politics are embedded in wider world politics and international society. An English School approach expands the analysis and puts into perspective how the Space Race was mutually constitutive of Cold War pluralist international society, and how space cooperation and commercialization over time also reflected and reinforced globalization and cooperative international society. However it is extremely difficult to operationalize the English School in order to draw more specific explanatory conclusions about individual case studies. It is necessary to use both approaches together to develop a thorough explanation of actors' behavior with regards to outer space politics, as well as an understanding of how outer space politics relate to wider world politics...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{sets out}} to answer three questions: what caused the IMF's {{apparent}} crisis of legitimacy {{in the aftermath of}} the Asian crisis, why were the subsequent reforms so limited and <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> apparent paradox <b>tell</b> us about the politics of IMF policy-making? Criticism of the Fund's role in Asia was largely criticism of Fund performance but the performance issues fed into pre-existing difficulties with the relationship between the Fund's role and its institutional structures. Essentially, the Fund's role had expanded in developing countries and contracted in developed countries but its institutions remained unchanged. The result was a growing imbalance between institutions designed to ensure IMF technical authority and an increasing need for more political kinds of legitimacy. The increasingly intrusive nature of Fund conditionality has also changed the audiences for Fund legitimacy claims as cooperation from domestic populations became more important to secure implementation. The first part of the thesis explores these developments providing an analysis of the logic of the ll iF's traditional legitimating justifications and a historical view of its evolution over time. The second part of the thesis examines the political consequences of these growing tensions in the context of the Asian crisis. Through four case studies (Indonesia, Malaysia, Korea and the US) it explores the nature of the new conditionality, the politics of programme implementation, forms of political resistance that materialised, and the nature of the relationship between the Fund, states and civil society. It argues that moves to engage civil society have created some modest successes but are ultimately limited by the overall institutional framework within which they operate. Internally, the Fund remains an institution dominated by developed countries despite being principally responsible for developing country policy. It is also dominated by financial elites in both developing and developed countries. Legitimacy is about the credibility of authority claims but the poütical significance of those claims lies in the extent to which they are able to attract political support and trigger political resistance. A combination of modest reforms, new arguments and public ambivalence or incomprehension have currently reduced political dissent but the possibility of further resistance, and therefore reform, in the face of subsequent crises persists while institutions remain unreformed...|$|R

[...] In that same preseason, ABA and NBA teams began playing {{exhibition}} games against each other. [...] The first such exhibition was played on September 21, 1971 with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and the Milwaukee Bucks defeating the Dallas Chaparrals, 106-103. [...] Gradually, the ABA began to prove itself superior, going 15-10 against the NBA in 1973, 16-7 in 1974, and 31-17 in 1975. Overall, the ABA won more of these interleague games than the NBA did, and in every matchup of reigning champions from the two leagues, the ABA champion won, including in the final pre-merger season when the Kentucky Colonels defeated the Golden State Warriors. Boston Globe sportswriter Bob Ryan said of the ABA-NBA exhibition games: [...] "When those exhibition games began, the view in the NBA was, 'Now we'll show those guys.'

Do those behaviors change over time (e. g., impacted by the 2008 market crash) ? Can we identify insiders who have similar trading behaviors? And <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>tell</b> us? This work presents the first academic, large-scale exploratory study of insider filings and related data, based on the complete Form 4 fillings from the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). We analyzed 12 million transactions by 370 thousand insiders spanning 1986 to 2012, the largest reported in academia. We explore the temporal and network-centric aspects of the trading behaviors of insiders, and make surprising and counter-intuitive discoveries. We study how the trading behaviors of insiders differ {{based on their}} roles in their companies, the transaction types, the company sectors, and their relationships with other insiders. Our work raises exciting research questions and opens up many opportunities for future studies. Most importantly, we believe our work could {{form the basis of}} novel tools for financial regulators and policymakers to detect illegal insider trading, help them understand the dynamics of the trades and enable them to adapt their detection strategies towards these dynamics.
