The Persian cavalry was usually {{provided}} by the ethnic Persians, Bactrians, Medes, Cissians, and Saka; most of these probably fought as lightly armed missile cavalry.

This turned out to be the case—Liverpool advanced through three qualifying rounds and were drawn with Chelsea in the group stages.

5|$|After {{the end of}} the Russian Civil War {{the victorious}} Bolsheviks {{considered}} finishing Izmail, and possibly Borodino, to their original design. It would have taken at least two years to build all of Izmails turrets, even if enough guns had been available. Ten had been delivered by Vickers before the Revolution and one gun had been completed domestically in 1912, but the prospects that more guns could be purchased from Vickers or that the Soviets could make more were not promising, given the state of their heavy industry {{in the wake of the}} Civil War. Another problem was the complicated electrical system; it could not be completed under current conditions, and at least twenty months <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> replace it with a simpler system.|$|E

The Turkish commanders now realised just what <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> capture the beachhead.

5|$|Gebhard clearly {{intended}} to transform an important ecclesiastical territory into a secular, dynastic duchy.

Furthermore, as a relatively young man, heirs would be expected.

5|$|In 1868, the Scottish {{shipbuilder}} John Elder {{published an}} article that advocated that widening the beam of a ship would reduce the area {{that needed to be}} protected and allow it to carry thicker armour and heavier, more powerful guns in comparison to a normal ship. In addition such a ship would have a shallower draught and only a moderate increase in power <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> match the speed of a normal ship. Sir Edward Reed, then Director of Naval Construction of the Royal Navy, agreed with Elder's conclusions. Rear-Admiral Andrei Alexandrovich Popov of the Imperial Russian Navy further expanded on Elder's concept by broadening the ship so that it was actually circular and he made the design flat-bottomed, unlike Elder's convex hull, to minimise its draught.|$|E
