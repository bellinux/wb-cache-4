40|$|Eukaryotic cells often form {{polarized}} <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> {{in response}} to internal or external cues. To understand the establishment of <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> with specific dimensions we used fission yeast, which grows as a rod-shaped cell of nearconstant width from <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> located at the cell tips. Removing the cell wall creates a round spheroplast with a disorganized cytoskeleton and depolarized growth proteins. As spheroplasts recover, new <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> form that resemble normal growing cell tips in shape and width, and polarized growth resumes. Regulators of the GTPase Cdc 42, which control width in exponentially growing cells, also control spheroplast <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> width. During recovery the Cdc 42 scaffold Scd 2 forms a polarized patch in the rounded spheroplast, demonstrating that a <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> protein can organize independent of cell shape. Rga 4, a Cdc 42 GTPase activating protein (GAP) that is excluded from cell tips, is initially distributed throughout the spheroplast membrane, but is excluded from the <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> after a stable patch of Scd 2 forms. These results provide evidence that <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> with normal width and protein localization can form de novo through sequential organization of cellular domains, and {{that the size of}} these <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> is genetically controlled, independent of preexisting cell shape...|$|R
40|$|The {{simplified}} {{tissue culture}} method and the fluorochrominized tissue culture method devised in our laboratory {{were applied to}} the bone marrow, spleen and lymph node of the leukemic mice of C 58 strain {{for the purpose of}} diagnosis and differentiation of leukemia. And following results were obtained; 1. In the case of spontaneous leukemia, tissue culture of the lymph node and spleen showed sharply defined <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> with increased cell density which is the characteric pattern of acute leukemia. The bone marrow showed rather diffuse border of <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> with the appearances of many migrating neutrophiles, but cell density was remarkably increased and many leukemic cells appeared in the <b>growth</b> <b>zone.</b> 2. In the case of myelogenos leukemia, the bone marrow culture showed so-called double <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> which is characteristic of chronic leukemia. On the other hand, the lymph node and the spleen showed diffuse border of the <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> with increased cell density. Numerouse immature and mature neutrophilic cells appeared in the <b>growth</b> <b>zone.</b> 3. By the fluorochrominized tissue culture method, the lymph node and the spleen of lymphatic leukemia showed typical lekemic <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> and gave diffuse yellowish-green color due to the cytoplasmic and nuclcar fluorescence of lymphoblasts and other lymphoid cells. On the other hand, the bone marrow, spleen and lymph node of myelogenous leukemia showed relatively diffuse pattern and the inner part of the <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> gave greenish fluorescence due to the cytoplasm and nucleus of immature leukemic cell, but in the periphery of the <b>growth</b> <b>zone,</b> reddish-orange color was predominant due to the fluoresceuce of cytoplasmic granules of mature neutrophiles. In conclusion, the lymph node and spleen in lymphatic leukemia and the bone marrow in myelogenous leukemia showed typical leukemic <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> respectively and these findings are useful for the differential diagnosis of mouse leukemia...|$|R
40|$|The design {{principles}} that underlie cellular morphogenetic mechanisms {{are central to}} understanding the generation of cell form. We have investigated the constraints governing the formation and positioning of new <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> in the fission yeast cell and have shown that establishment of a new axis of polarity is independent of microtubules {{and that in the}} absence of microtubules a new <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> is activated near the nucleus {{in the middle of the}} cell. Activation of a new <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> can occur at any stage of the cell cycle as long as the nucleus is a sufficient distance away from previously growing ends. The positioning of <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> is regulated by the polarity marker Tea 1 delivered by microtubules; cells with short microtubules locate the <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> near the region where the microtubules terminate. We propose a model for the activation of new <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> comprising a long-range laterally inhibitory component and a self-activating positive local component that is delivered to cell ends by Tea 1 and the microtubules. The principle of this symmetry-breaking design may also apply to the morphogenesis of other cells...|$|R
40|$|Skin {{appendage}} formation {{represents a}} process of regulated new growth. Bromodeoxyuridine labeling of developing chicken skin demonstrated the presence of localized <b>growth</b> <b>zones,</b> which first promote appendage formation and then move within each appendage to produce specific shapes. Initially, cells proliferate all over the presumptive skin. During the placode stage they are organized to form periodic rings. At the short feather bud stage, the localized <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> shifted to the posterior and then the distal bud. During the long bud stage, the localized <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> descended through the flank region toward the feather collar (equivalent to the hair matrix). During feather branch formation, the localized <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> were positioned periodically in the basilar layer to enhance branching of barb ridges. Wnts were expressed in a dynamic fashion during feather morphogenesis that coincided with the shifting localized <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> positions. The expression pattern of Wnt 6 was examined and compared {{with other members of}} the Wnt pathway. Early in feather development Wnt 6 expression overlapped with the location of the localized <b>growth</b> <b>zones.</b> Its function was tested through misexpression studies. Ectopic Wnt 6 expression produced abnormal localized outgrowths from the skin appendages at either the base, the shaft, or the tip of the developing feathers. Later in feather filament morphogenesis, several Wnt markers were expressed in regions undergoing rearrangements and differentiation of barb ridge keratinocytes. These data suggest that skin appendages are built to specific shapes by adding new cells from well-positioned and controlled localized <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> and that Wnt activity is involved in regulating such localized <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> activity...|$|R
40|$|A. niger and two {{strains of}} A. nidulans were studied. The radial growth rate (Kr) of these colonies {{was found to}} be a {{function}} of the length (w) of the leading hyphae spanning the colony’s peripheral <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> and the specific growth rate (a) of these hyphae. Thus Kr = EW. The peripheral <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> is the region in which hyphae are able to contribute protoplasm to the apical extension of the colony’s leading hyphae. The width of the peripheral <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> remained constant with time but varied from 423,urn. for G. lactis to 8660 pm. for R. stolonifer. The specific growth rate of the hyphae in the colony’s peripheral <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> appeared to be identical to the organism’s maximum specific growth rate in submerged culture. The width of the peripheral <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> was not influenced by temperature or by adding an inhibitor to the medium but did vary with glucose concentration. An observed difference between the radial growth rates of the two strains of Aspergillus nidulans, which had almost identical specific growth rates in submerged culture, {{was found to be}} correlated with a difference between the widths of their respective peripheral <b>growth</b> <b>zones.</b> Although {{there was a significant difference}} in the length of the apical cells and hyphal compartments of the leading hyphae of these strains, the <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> of the hyphae of each strain contained 16 septa; it is suggested that the strains differ in the frequency of septum formation but not in the rate at which the septa become plugged...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDuring {{development}} and regeneration, new cells are added and incorporated to the liver parenchyma. Regulation {{of this process}} contributes to the final {{size and shape of}} the particular organs, including the liver. We identified the distribution of liver <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> using an embryonic chicken model because of its accessibility to experimentation. Hepatocyte precursors were first generated all over the primordia surrounding the vitelline blood vessel at embryonic day 2 (E 2), then became limited to the peripheral <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> around E 6. Differentiating daughter cells of the peripheral hepatocyte precursors were shown by DiI microinjection to be laid inward and were subsequently organized to form the hepatic architecture. At E 8, hepatocyte precursor cells were further restricted to limited segments of the periphery, called localized <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> (LoGZ). Adhesion and signaling molecules in the <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> were studied. Among them, β-catenin and Wnt 3 a were highly enriched. We overexpressed constitutively active β-catenin using replication competent avian sarcoma (RCAS) virus. Liver size increased about 3 -fold with an expanded hepatocyte precursor cell population. In addition, blocking β-catenin activity by either overexpression of dominant-negative LEF 1 or overexpression of a secreted Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf (DKK) resulted in decreased liver size with altered liver shape. Our data suggest that (1) the duration of active <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> activity modulates the size of the liver; (2) a shift in the position of the localized <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> helps to shape the liver; and (3) β-catenin/Wnt are involved in regulating <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> activities during liver development...|$|R

40|$|Allocentrotus fragilis (Jackson) was {{obtained}} from six stations at depths of 100 to 1, 260 m on the continental shelf and upper slope off Newport, Oregon. Ages and growth rates of A. fragilis were determined by two methods: (1) from size-frequency distributions of trawl collections from 200 m, and (2) from <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> on skeletal test plates. Collections from other depths were not adequate for size-frequency analyses. Gonad indices of A. fragilis from 200 m {{were used to determine}} spawning periodicity and frequency. A semiannual frequency was suggested, with spawning occurring in early spring and early autumn. No individuals collected below 400 m were reproductively mature. A procedure was developed to make <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> of the skeletal test plates visible. Dark <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> are thought to correspond to semiannual periods of growth, one-half the number of dark <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> indicating the urchin's age. The growth curve of A. fragilis from 200 m, which was plotted from the mean test diameter of age groups defined by test plate <b>growth</b> <b>zones,</b> shows a good least-squares fit to von Bertalanffy's growth equation. Growth rates determined from plate <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> appeared to be similar for A. fragilis from 100 to 600 m, but decreased for specimens from 800 to 1, 260 m.

40|$|A {{prospective}} {{model of}} dorsal-fin spine growth in chondrichthyans is devised {{by studying the}} growth of spines from captive and wild Heterodontus portusjacksoni injected with several fluorochromes. Evidence was found for only two dentine layers in the spine trunk of H. portusjacksoni, contrasting with conjectures {{about the presence of}} a third middle dentine layer in some squalids. The spines have three simultaneous <b>growth</b> <b>zones.</b> The first <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> is along the internal edge of the inner trunk dentine layer, where growth bands are deposited towards the centre (centripetally), increasing spine length and width by pressure against the cartilage rod. The second <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> is along the external edge of the outer trunk dentine layer at the spine base, where growth bands are deposited in an opposite direction to the centre (centrifugally), increasing spine width. A third <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> {{at the base of the}} cap enables downward expansion over the trunk. The model of concentric cones describes correctly the inner dentine layer growth pattern, whereas the outer dentine layer growth increments appear to be related to the external bands on the surface of the trunk.

40|$|Two {{methods were}} used to {{validate}} age determination of horse mackerel otoliths. In the first, whole otoliths were examined with a light microscope. Age was determined by identifying and counting annuli. Marginal increment widths were also measured and served to estimate ages, which ranged from 0. 6 – 4. 3 years. In the second method, otoliths were examined with a scanning electron microscope and fish ages were determined by daily increment counts. Sixty-four otolith specimens from the Southeast Atlantic and 24 from the Northeast Atlantic were aged by counting the daily growth increments. The number of daily increments was highly variable within each <b>growth</b> <b>zone.</b> Ages exceeding 365 days in the first annual <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> indicated that the first annulus was not always deposited in some fish. The variable daily increment counts in the first year's <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> {{may be related to}} the very protracted spawning season of horse mackerel.

40|$|The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a rod [...] â€shaped {{cell that}} grows by linear {{extension}} at the cell tips, with a nearly constant width throughout the cell cycle. This simple geometry {{makes it a}} good system to study the control of cellular dimensions. Here I used {{the width of the}} cell {{as a model for the}} control of <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> size. To identify genes that influence cell size I carried out a near [...] â€genome [...] â€widescreen for mutants wider than wild [...] â€type cells. I found eleven deletion mutants that were wider; seven of the deleted genes are implicated in the control of the small GTPase Cdc 42. Further analyses showed two different pathways are involved: one is defined by the Cdc 42 guanine [...] â€nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Scd 1 and the second by the GTPase activating protein (GAP) Rga 4. Deletions of rga 4 and scd 1 had additive effects on cell width, and the proteins localized independently of one another, with Rga 4 located at the cell sides and Scd 1 at the cell tips. Delocalization and ectopic retargeting experiments showed that these localizations are crucial for Rga 4 â€™s and Scd 1 â€™s roles in determining cell width. I propose that the GAP Rga 4 and the GEF Scd 1 establish a gradient of activated Cdc 42 at the cellular tip, and it is this gradient that determines cell <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> size and thus cell width. Cell wall removal generates round spheroplasts that can recover into normal rod [...] â€shaped cells, allowing the study of how a <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> of a particular shape and dimensions is formed. Spheroplasts initially have a disorganized cytoskeleton and depolarized <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> proteins. During recovery, these components repolarize and form one, or in some cases two, new <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> from the rounded spheroplast body. Regenerated new <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> have the same width as wild [...] â€type rod [...] â€shaped cells, and their width is controlled by the same genes that determine the width of normal exponentially growing cells. Scd 2, a scaffold protein that is normally localized to the <b>growth</b> <b>zone,</b> forms a polarized patch in the rounded spheroplast before cell shape becomes polarized, showing that a <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> protein can self [...] â€ organize independent of cell shape. Rga 4 is initially randomly distributed along the round spheroplast membrane but is excluded from the de novo <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> as <b>growth</b> begins. A stable patch of Scd 2 forms before Rga 4 is reorganized, suggesting that growth polarization may precede Rga 4 exclusion. These results provide evidence that a cellâ€™s <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> can form de novo with the correct dimensions and that the cellâ€™s rod shape is a cell [...] â€intrinsic, genetically controlled trait that does not depend on cell wall history. These studies show that the spatial regulation of Cdc 42 is a major determinant of cell width in exponentially growing cells, and influences the width of a <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> formed do novo.

In contrast to recent advances in understanding the molecu-lar basis of vernalization in Arabidopsis non-vernalization mutants or the spring growth habits of cereal crops such as wheat and barley, natural variations in <b>winter</b> <b>growth</b> habits and their geographic distribution are poorly under-stood. We analyzed varietal variation and the geographic distribution of the degree of vernalization requirements in germplasms of domesticated barley and wild barley collec-tions.

Thus, in or-der to develop mathematical thinking and problem solving as effectively as possible, it is im-portant to enable learners to address any mathematics anxiety explicitly. Some interventions have been found effective in reducing mathematical anxiety, and some in building mathematical resilience.

However, the use of the <b>Growth</b> <b>Zone</b> model and other resources designed to develop mathematical resilience can have long-term positive impact on learners’ ability to manage the affective domain.

Both validation methods indicated that opaque zones formed over the austral summer and were completed by autumn to winter (April to August). The direct comparison of age estimates obtained from otoliths and dorsal-fin spines of the same fish indicated bias, which was assumed to be due to poor increment clarity and resorption of early <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> in spines, resulting in imprecise age estimates.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{distribution}} of curvature and of bending speed along the cell's growing region are studied during steady state phototropic bending. At the start, elemental bending speed parallels the known axial {{distribution of}} growth rate. Hence regional phototropic sensitivity is initially {{determined by the}} local growth rate, and unilateral visible light acts proportionally {{at all levels of}} the <b>growth</b> <b>zone.</b> In the later course of bending, the bending speed distribution shifts downward instead of progressing upward in step with the cell's elongation. Furthermore, during phototropic inversion reversed bending begins high in the <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> and progresses downward while normal bending continues below. These spatial and temporal changes in the distribution of differential growth are considered to be due to a fixed rate of supply of material used in growth that is transported from lower regions of the cell and asymmetrically distributed within the <b>growth</b> <b>zone.</b> This paper examines the development of phototropic bending in the sporangiophore of Phycomyces exposed to unilateral illumination.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the onset of flows induced by gravity during phase separation of fluids, {{the behavior of a}} density-matched liquid mixture is studied after a temperature quench. Phase transition is investigated {{in the presence of a}} weak linear concentration (and thus, density) gradient. We observe a “fast” <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> for critical and near critical concentrations where phase separation proceeds by coalescence of interconnected domains. A “slow” <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> surrounds the fast <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> for off-critical concentrations where phase separation occurs through coalescence of spherical droplets. We observe at late times the development of a pattern of convective rolls, due to a Rayleigh-taylor instability between the fast and slow zones. The rate of evolution of the instability is several orders of magnitude lower than expected. This is because when the flows develop, the adjacent phases are likely to have a density difference much smaller than that expected between the coexisting phases at equilibrium...|$|R
40|$|Regulation of cell {{growth is}} {{paramount}} to all living organisms. In plants, algae and fungi, regulation of expansive growth of cells {{is required for}} development and morphogenesis. Also, many sensory responses of stage IVb sporangiophores of Phycomyces blakesleeanus are produced by regulating elongation growth rate (growth responses) and differential elongation growth rate (tropic responses). “Stiff” mutant sporangiophores exhibit diminished tropic responses and {{are found to be}} defective in at least five genes; madD, E, F, G, and J. Prior experimental research suggests that the defective genes affect growth regulation, but this was not verified. All the growth of the single-celled stalk of the stage IVb sporangiophore occurs in a short region termed the “growth zone. ” Prior experimental and theoretical research indicates that elongation growth rate of the stage IVb sporangiophore can be regulated by controlling the cell wall mechanical properties within the <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> and the magnitude of the turgor pressure. A quantitative biophysical model for elongation growth rate is required to elucidate the relationship between wall mechanical properties and turgor pressure during growth regulation. In this study, it is hypothesized that the mechanical properties of the wall within the <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> of stiff mutant sporangiophores are different compared to wild type (WT). A biophysical equation for elongation growth rate is derived for fungal and plant cells with a <b>growth</b> <b>zone.</b> Two strains of stiff mutants are studied, C 149 madD 120 (−) and C 216 geo- (−). Experimental results demonstrate that turgor pressure is larger but irreversible wall deformation rates within the <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> and <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> length are smaller for stiff mutant sporangiophores compared to WT. These findings can explain the diminished tropic responses of the stiff mutant sporangiophores. It is speculated that the defective genes affect the amount of wall-building material delivered to the inner cell wall...|$|R

Biomechanical studies investigating the effect of cyclical loading and then axial compression to failure of the porcine spine have disclosed that the endplate and the <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> are the weakest part of the cyclically loaded functional spinal units (Thoreson et al. 2010).

The disparity between net deposition rates and net exogenous influx of NH 4 + indicated that growing cells imported NH 4 + from more mature tissue, whereas more mature root tissues assimilated or translocated a portion of the NH 4 + absorbed. Net root NO 3 – influx under Ca(NO 3) 2 nutrition was adequate to account for pools found in the <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> and provided twice as much as was deposited locally throughout the non-growing tissue. In contrast, net root NO 3 – influx under NH 4 NO 3 was less than the local deposition rate in the <b>growth</b> <b>zone,</b> indicating that additional NO 3 – was imported or metabolically produced. The profile of NO 3 – deposition rate in the <b>growth</b> <b>zone,</b> however, was similar for the plants receiving Ca(NO 3) 2 or NH 4 NO 3. These results suggest that NO 3 – may serve a major role as an osmoticant for supporting root elongation in the basal part of the <b>growth</b> <b>zone</b> and maintaining root function in the young mature tissues...|$|R
40|$|Plants are sessile organisms {{forced to}} adjust to their {{surrounding}} environment. In a single plant the photoautotrophic shoot is exposed to pronounced environmental variations recurring in a day-night 24 [*]h (diel) cycle, whereas the heterotrophic root grows in a temporally less fluctuating environment. The contrasting habitats of shoots and roots are reflected in different diel growth patterns and their responsiveness to environmental stimuli. Differences between diel leaf growth patterns of mono- and dicotyledonous plants correspond to their different organization and placement of <b>growth</b> <b>zones.</b> In monocots, heterotrophic <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> are organized linearly and protected from the environment by sheaths of older leaves. In contrast, photosynthetically active <b>growth</b> <b>zones</b> of dicot leaves are exposed directly {{to the environment and}} show characteristic, species-specific diel growth patterns. It is hypothesized that the different exposure to environmental constraints and simultaneously the sink/source status of the growing organs may have induced distinct endogenous control of diel growth patterns in roots and leaves of monocot and dicot plants. Confronted by strong temporal fluctuations in environment, the circadian clock may facilitate robust intrinsic control of leaf growth in dicot plant...|$|R
