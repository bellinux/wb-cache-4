Until its discontinuation on May 20, 2014, Mario Kart DS supported online play via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, in which up to 4 players could play together. <b>When</b> <b>playing</b> online, participants could only race against each other; Battle mode is not available <b>when</b> <b>playing</b> via an online connection. These features are not available in the Wii U VC version because the multiplayer features have not been emulated. R.O.B. is a middleweight character.|$|E

5|$|The {{game has}} two player {{character}}s: Takeshi Kuranari and the Kid. Depending {{on the character}} the player plays as, they get to build relationships with different characters: for instance, the player can become close to Tsugumi Komachi <b>when</b> <b>playing</b> as Takeshi, who just is a supporting character <b>when</b> <b>playing</b> as the Kid. The player character is not chosen directly; instead, a decision the player makes during a blackout {{in the beginning of}} the game determines who they will play as.|$|E

5|$|McLean's favoured {{position}} is {{as a central}} midfielder, but he can also play as a left midfielder.

5|$|Thus, a {{political}} wire-puller such as Grigori Rasputin enjoys power best <b>when</b> <b>playing</b> off another person's hereditary power, {{or when the}} organisation benefits largely from an air of mystery.

5|$|When using Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection {{for online}} multiplayer, the player can choose between a match with a random {{opponent}} {{from around the}} world, or a match with someone that the player has exchanged friend codes with. Worldwide matches are limited to two players, with the weather conditions being randomly generated and a map randomly chosen from a set list. Worldwide match players can choose if they want an opponent close to their skill level or to play against an opponent regardless of skill level. <b>When</b> <b>playing</b> with a friend, more options are opened up to allow greater customization of the match, such as the type of weather and {{the duration of the}} match. Voice chat is only supported <b>when</b> <b>playing</b> with a friend, and is unavailable during worldwide online play. However, Caulder can not be used in ONLINE multiplayer due to his extreme advantages.|$|E
5|$|Breuer {{attended}} the Paralympics in London, {{but as a}} wheelchair basketball player {{rather than as a}} fencer.

She is classified as a 1.5 point player, but women get a 1.5 point bonus <b>when</b> <b>playing</b> on a mixed team, making her in effect a zero-point player. Her classification, along with her high technical acumen, means that she is a valuable asset on any team.|$|E

5|$|Different {{combinations}} of players, gongs and mallets {{can be used}} for playing the agung: two players with each assigned their own gong or just one. <b>When</b> <b>playing</b> alone, the agung player could either play both gongs with the player holding the higher-pitched gongs face-to-face, with the lower one held at an angle by an assistant for stability, or just one gong. The latter style, common among downriver Maguindanaos in Simuay, who consider this style an old one, uses only the higher-pitch gong for it, unlike the lower-pitched gong, is considered the lead gong, therefore having primary importance. An example of this is when single gong agungs are used during a tagunggo piece.|$|E

At six games with an assist, Hyman also tied for the most consecutive games with an assist by a rookie with Dan Daoust, Bob Nevin, and Frank Nigro. On March 28, 2017, <b>when</b> <b>playing</b> the Florida Panthers, Hyman set the Toronto Maple Leafs record for most short handed goals in a single season by a rookie with four.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of 2013, in order to rest his body and improve his chances of playing in the 2015 Rugby World Cup McCaw {{enforced}} the sabbatical clause in his NZRFU contract. As a result, he only played the latter rounds of Super Rugby, and missed the 2013 French Test Series. He later returned to captain the All Blacks as they successfully defended the Rugby Championship. During this campaign, McCaw equalled (with Brian O'Driscoll of Ireland and John Smit of South Africa) the record as captaining the most test matches (83). McCaw subsequently overtook this record <b>when</b> <b>playing</b> in Japan on 2 November 2013.
