5000|$|Although he briefly contemplates suicide, Matt's {{memories}} of Karen {{give him the}} strength to go on, and he tracks Macabes to his headquarters, fighting his way through various hired fighters to the final stronghold, where Macabes reveals his real identity; Mysterio. About a year ago, Mysterio was diagnosed with lung cancer and an inoperable brain tumour from the gases he used in his crimes, but his resolve {{to go out on}} his greatest scheme against his greatest foe was cut short as the current Spider-Man was only a clone (Ben Reilly), so Mysterio instead turned his attention to Daredevil, whom he'd once fought after the apparent death of the Avengers. His reasoning was, as he put it, <b>who</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> face a second-rate villain than a second-rate hero? After purchasing information about Daredevil from the Kingpin, Mysterio created the whole elaborate scheme, using artificial insemination to impregnate the girl, drugging Nelson and feeding the 'divorcee'—really an actress with a drug habit—bad drugs to make it appear that she'd been killed, posing as Karen's doctor to fake the HIV diagnosis ("Maybe she was, maybe she wasn't, you'd think she'd at least have gotten a second opinion"), and subsequently hiring Bullseye to lure Daredevil here for the final round.|$|E

'Mosh' {{is not only a}} worthy follow-up to 'Lose Yourself,' it had the potential to shepherd thousands of young, seemingly apathetic voters to the polls on Election Day—had it not been released after almost every registration deadline in the country." [...] The publisher added that the song [...] "matched America’s angriest pop voice with America’s most righteous pastime: Bush-bashing. George W. Bush and Eminem might seem like unlikely foes—after all, the enemy of your enemy is your friend, right?—but Eminem is the poster boy for pushing the limits of the 1st Amendment, and bashing the President is currently the most vilified form of free speech in the country, so <b>who</b> <b>better</b> <b>to</b> champion the cause?
