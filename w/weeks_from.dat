5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare can {{be grown}} in pure culture on agar-containing plates {{supplemented}} with nutrients. The colonies that grow are white to pale cream, and cover the agar surface within six <b>weeks</b> <b>from</b> the initial inoculation. The mycelium is made of bent-over hyphae, without any aerial hyphae (hyphae that extend above {{the surface of the}} agar). Typically, two indistinct zones develop at about 6mm and 15mm from the initial inoculum spot, with each zone roughly 4mm wide. The zones appear somewhat lighter in color because the hyphae are more closely packed and form crystalline substances that deposit into the agar.|$|E
5|$|During 1971–72 Zappa {{released}} two strongly jazz-oriented solo LPs, Waka/Jawaka and The Grand Wazoo, {{which were}} recorded during the forced layoff from concert touring, using floating line-ups of session players and Mothers alumni. Musically, the albums were akin to Hot Rats, {{in that they}} featured extended instrumental tracks with extended soloing. Zappa began touring again in late 1972. His first effort {{was a series of}} concerts in September 1972 with a 20-piece big band referred to as the Grand Wazoo. This was followed by a scaled-down version known as the Petit Wazoo that toured the U.S. for five <b>weeks</b> <b>from</b> October to December 1972.|$|E
5|$|Federer was {{the first}} to come to {{prominence}} after winning Wimbledon in 2003 and established himself as the world No. 1 by the beginning of 2004. Nadal followed in 2005 after a French Open triumph including a win over Federer, and they occupied the top two places in the ATP rankings for 211 consecutive <b>weeks</b> <b>from</b> July 2005 to August 2009. Djokovic, from 2007, and later Murray, from 2008, increasingly challenged Federer and Nadal's dominance with seasonal consistency. Djokovic captured three of the four major tournaments in 2011, and in 2012 the quartet won one Major tournament apiece. In 2011, Nadal declared that his and Federer's period of joint dominance had ended, owing to the ascent of other players, notably Djokovic and later Murray.|$|E

5|$|In March 1994, the Washington Agreement was signed, {{ending the}} Croat–Bosniak War, and {{providing}} Croatia with US military advisors from the Military Professional Resources Incorporated (MPRI). The US involvement reflected a new military strategy endorsed by Bill Clinton in February 1993. Because the UN arms embargo {{was still in}} place, the MPRI was hired ostensibly to prepare the HV {{for participation in the}} NATO Partnership for Peace programme. They trained HV officers and personnel for 14 <b>weeks</b> <b>from</b> January to April 1995. It has also been speculated in several sources,including The New York Times and various Serbian media reports, that the MPRI may have provided doctrinal advice, scenario planning and US government satellite intelligence to Croatia. MPRI, American and Croatian officials have denied such claims. In November 1994, the US unilaterally ended the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina, allowing the HV to supply itself as arms shipments flowed through Croatia.|$|E

After a draw with the Stormers and a bye, the Highlanders had gone unbeaten for eight weeks. Three <b>weeks</b> <b>from</b> the end of the round robin they were third, but after losing their remaining three matches fell to eighth for the season.|$|E
