5|$|Shortly thereafter, {{however, the}} Owsla of Efrafa, led by <b>Woundwort</b> himself arrives {{to attack the}} newly formed warren at Watership Down. Through Bigwig's bravery and loyalty, and Hazel's ingenuity, the Watership Down rabbits seal {{the fate of the}} Efrafan general by unleashing the Nuthanger Farm watchdog. As the Efrafans flee in terror, <b>Woundwort,</b> a {{formidable}} fighter by rabbit standards, fearlessly stands his ground as he and the dog simultaneously lunge at each other. Woundwort's body is never found, and at least one of his former followers continues to believe in his survival. Hazel is nearly killed by a cat, but he is saved by the farm girl Lucy, the owner of the escaped hutch rabbits.|$|E
5|$|Vervain: The {{head of the}} Council {{police in}} Efrafa, said {{to be one of}} the most hated rabbits in the warren. When Woundwort's forces storm the Honeycomb, he is ordered by <b>Woundwort</b> to kill Fiver, but Fiver's supernatural calmness and prophesising of his (Vervain's) death terrify him into fleeing, and he is never seen again.|$|E
5|$|General Woundwort: The main antagonist: a fearless, cunning and brutally {{efficient}} rabbit who was orphaned {{at a young}} age, <b>Woundwort</b> {{founded the}} Efrafa warren and is its tyrannical chief. Though larger and stronger than Bigwig, he lacks mercy and kindness. He even leads an attack to destroy the Watership warren {{as an act of}} revenge against Bigwig stealing does from Efrafa, which is narrowly defeated by Hazel's ingenuity and Bigwig's bravery. After his apparent death fighting the Nuthanger farm dog, he lives on in rabbit legend as a bogeyman.|$|E

50|$|Shale - is {{a rabbit}} from the Darkhaven Owsla who {{followed}} General <b>Woundwort's</b> orders to destroy Watership Down. In the final battle, he, along with Feldspar {{and the rest}} of the Darkhaven rabbits, were taken by the Black Rabbit of Inlé.|$|R
50|$|Feldspar - is {{a rabbit}} from the Darkhaven Owsla who follows General <b>Woundwort's</b> orders to destroy Watership Down. He is always seen with Granite, Spartina and Shale. In the final battle, he, along with Shale {{and the rest}} of the Darkhaven rabbits, were taken by the Black Rabbit of Inlé.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Hazel and Pipkin, the {{smallest}} {{member of the}} group, scout the nearby Nuthanger Farm, where they find two pairs of hutch rabbits. Despite their uncertainty about living wild, the hutch rabbits are willing to come to Watership. Hazel leads a raid on the farm the next day, during which he rescues both does but {{only one of the}} bucks. When the emissary returns soon after, Hazel and his rabbits learn that Efrafa is a police state led by the despotic General <b>Woundwort.</b> Holly and the other rabbits dispatched there have managed to return with little more than their lives intact.|$|E
25|$|Hurt {{appeared}} in the 1978 Midnight Express, for which he won a Golden Globe and a BAFTA and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (the latter of which he lost to Christopher Walken for his performance in The Deer Hunter). Around the same time, he lent his voice to Ralph Bakshi's animated film adaptation of Lord of the Rings, {{playing the role of}} Aragorn. Hurt voiced Hazel, the heroic rabbit leader of his warren in the film adaptation of Watership Down (both 1978) and later played the major villain, General <b>Woundwort,</b> in the animated television series version. As the deformed John Merrick in The Elephant Man (1980), he won another BAFTA and was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Academy Award for Best Actor.|$|E
500|$|Bigwig: An ex-Owsla officer, and {{the largest}} and bravest rabbit of the group. His name in Lapine is Thlayli, which {{literally}} means [...] "Fur-head" [...] and refers to the shock of fur {{on the back of}} his head. Though he is powerful and fierce, he is also shown to be cunning in his own way when he devises a plan to defeat the larger and stronger General <b>Woundwort.</b> [...] His final battle with <b>Woundwort</b> leaves him severely wounded, but he survives and becomes the leader of Hazel's Owsla.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} the hero has invited {{comparisons}} between Watership Down's characters and those in Homer's Odyssey and Virgil's Aeneid. Hazel's courage, Bigwig's strength, Blackberry's ingenuity and craftiness, and Dandelion's and Bluebell's poetry and storytelling all have parallels in the epic poem Odyssey. Kenneth Kitchell declared, [...] "Hazel stands {{in the tradition of}} Odysseus, Aeneas, and others". Tolkien scholar John Rateliff calls Adams's novel an Aeneid [...] "what-if" [...] book: what if the seer Cassandra (Fiver) had been believed and she and a company had fled Troy (Sandleford Warren) before its destruction? What if Hazel and his companions, like Odysseus, encounter a seductive home at Cowslip's Warren (Land of the Lotus Eaters)? Rateliff goes on to compare the rabbits' battle with <b>Woundwort's</b> Efrafans to Aeneas's fight with Turnus's Latins. [...] "By basing his story {{on one of the most}} popular books of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, Adams taps into a very old myth: the flight from disaster, the heroic refugee in search of a new home, a story that was already over a thousand years old when Virgil told it in 19 BC." ...|$|R
40|$|Coins and {{commemorative}} medals constitute {{one special}} repository {{of the history}} of medicine. The numismatic record has proved to be the most enduring, albeit one of the most selective, records of the progress of history. Matters of health, and especially those of medicine, have been central to the endeavours and indeed the survival of many cultures and societies. Many such themes in the national histories and later international history of medicine are preserved in the numismatic record. Coins and medallions thus constitute one record of the chronology of the profession of medicine, a repository parallel to and a reflection of that more traditional history to be found in oral and written accounts. Medical numismatics is built upon the metonymic use of symbols to denote positive health, the cure of disease, convalescence and rehabilitation. The Greek medical pantheon is featured on contemporary Greek coins from the fourth to the first century B. C. E. Therein also are portrayals of the Aesculapean serpent, used metonymically to denote health and the cure of disease. Effigies of healer gods - Apollo, Chiron, Asklepios and Hygieia are to be found particularly on coins struck at the great healing shrines at Pergamum, Epidaurus and Kos. Numismatic synechdochee is a common theme on ancient Greek and later Roman coins. The moneyers of the day engraved a variety of symbols on their dies - the Aesculapean serpent, the patera, the cock, the Delphic omphalus, the Aesculapean dog were some of the symbols used to denote the parent deity. Some of the earliest numismatic themes portray <b>woundworts.</b> Such included the now extinct herb, silphium (prob. Ferula sp.), from Cyrene in North Africa; and selinon (Apium graveolens), the wild celery from the eastern Mediterranean and central Europe. Today, in the twenty-first century, coins continue to be used as the pragmatic medium by which medical and health themes are promoted. In the last decade alone, Australia has minted and issued six coins portraying health and medical themes...|$|R

The undergrowth also presents great diversity in plant life. To wit, the south-facing slopes are principally covered in Scots pines and their undergrowth strongly resembles heath, with in particular common heather and crowberry. The rest of the coniferous forests include most often whortleberry, northern oak fern, <b>woundwort,</b> and common cow-wheat. The soil rich in diabase allows the growth of more demanding plants, such as Alpine blue-sow-thistle, wood cranesbill [...] and northern wolfsbane.

50|$|Hazel prays to Frith, {{offering}} {{his life for}} that {{of those in the}} warren, a bargain Frith acknowledges, but does not accept. Hazel releases the dog while his companions bait it into following them to Watership Down; Hazel is attacked by the cat, but saved by Lucy (the owner of the hutch rabbits). When the Efrafans break through the warren's defences, <b>Woundwort</b> goes in alone; Blackavar attacks him, but <b>Woundwort</b> slays him easily. Bigwig ambushes <b>Woundwort</b> and they fight to exhaustion. The dog arrives and attacks the Efrafan soldiers. Hearing the commotion, <b>Woundwort</b> abandons Bigwig and fearlessly confronts the dog. No trace of <b>Woundwort</b> is found, leaving his fate ambiguous.|$|E

50|$|Limestone <b>woundwort</b> is {{protected}} under the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act, and {{was found in the}} area in 1897 by Mr C Buckenall. It has not been previously recorded in the United Kingdom. Another site was then discovered in Denbighshire. The plant grows in mountainous regions in central and southern Europe, and its alternative name is alpine <b>woundwort.</b> When the reserve was purchased only a few limestone <b>woundwort</b> plants remained. Dr M Martin (Bristol University) grew some from local seed. These were transplanted into the site. In a good season, a number of flowering spikes can be seen beneath the hedgerow on the site.|$|E

50|$|General <b>Woundwort</b> - He {{serves as}} the main {{antagonist}} of the series. A brutal and tyrannical leader who sees himself as the one doing everything for {{the best of his}} warren, <b>Woundwort</b> strives to destroy Hazel and his 'outsiders' because of the hope for free life they represent for his own subjects. He has black, ragged fur and is blind in his left eye. He deeply respects Campion, even after his betrayal by him, and he often punishes and threatens Vervain, but still values him as an adviser and loyal subject despite this. He briefly shows a softer side after Pipkin tells him that his parents were killed by a weasel (a fate that <b>Woundwort</b> himself went through), and for a brief moment before Efrafa's destruction sees himself for what he is and what he has brought Efrafa to. After the destruction of Efrafa, <b>Woundwort</b> becomes obsessed with seeking his destiny of destruction, which leads him to the warren he was born in: Darkhaven. In the end, he is taken by the Black Rabbit of Inlé along with most of the Darkhaven rabbits.|$|E
50|$|Vervain - is a cowardly and sneaky rabbit, {{more adept}} at spying on others and {{threatening}} the weaker ones then in actual combat and is (next to <b>Woundwort)</b> the most hated and despised rabbit of the Watership Down story. Despite his shortcomings, <b>Woundwort</b> values him (though he would not show this) for his loyalty to him. Although Campion saved his life {{on more than one}} occasion, Vervain hates him with a passion and would like nothing better than to make <b>Woundwort</b> realize Campion is a traitor. Kehaar is particularly not fond of Vervain and calls him an 'ugly bunny'. After Efrafa's destruction, Vervain tries to live on his own but quickly loses hope, until he is saved by <b>Woundwort</b> from a weasel. Although somewhat shocked by his master's increasing madness, Vervain continues to serve him, though more out of fear than loyalty, and he secretly longs to lead a different life, even if such thoughts are futile. At the end, Vervain flees from the final battle and is not seen again.|$|E
