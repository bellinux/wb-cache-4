Despite its {{advanced}} design, the price tag was modest: about US$1million. By late 1956 {{it was clear that}} ZETA <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> online in mid-1957, beating the Model C stellarator and the newest versions of the Perhapsatron and Columbus. Because these projects were secret, based on the little information available the press concluded they were versions of the same conceptual device, and that the British were far ahead in the race to produce a working machine.|$|E
25|$|A very frail Ethel {{returns to}} Albert Square in 2000, {{arriving}} unannounced at Pauline Fowler's (Wendy Richard) house. Ethel {{had run away}} from her retirement village and had decided that she <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back to the square, {{to live in the}} place she loves with her old friends. Ethel is now restricted to a wheelchair and it is left to Dot to cater for her every need, which often leaves her exhausted. Ethel appears to have lost none of her zest for life, despite her considerable age, so it is a huge shock to Dot when Ethel reveals that she is suffering from terminal cancer and is not going to live much longer. Ethel reveals that she has come home to the square to die, but instead of waiting to die in agony, she wants to choose her final moments so she can die with dignity.|$|E

Meanwhile, Mulder's boss, Deputy Director Kersh, informs Doggett {{that he intends}} to deny the request. As season eight was nearly over, the producers and writers decided to refuse Mulder re-admittance into the FBI as a way to segue John Doggett and Monica Reyes into the series as the new main stars of season nine. David Duchovny agreed with this method, noting, [...] "I completely thought it was correct that they should be trying to focus elsewhere, and that, since I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back for the second half of season eight, if you were to refocus on whatever Mulder's up to, you'd be in the same lousy situation at the beginning of season nine." ...|$|E

The group chose Valentine because he had produced Queens of the Stone Age's Songs for the Deaf (2002) and Third Eye Blind's self-titled album (1997). Although they met with Howard Benson and Rob Cavallo, the band's [...] "love of Eric’s work kind of trumped any other meeting we had." [...] Unlike their previous records, the group worked in a large studio (Barefoot Studios in Los Angeles, California). Warner Bros. told them, [...] "Take your time and it’s done when you’re done with it," [...] and the band re-recorded the demos. According to Mascherino, the group [...] "knew how it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out... was a thorough way to do it."

PlanetOut Inc. hosted an online poll in the weeks prior to the episode to determine based on [...] "cartoon gaydar" [...] who was gay on the Simpsons, with 97% of the respondents choosing Smithers.

500|$|Just as the {{aircraft}} hit takeoff speed, the No.1 Engine and its pylon assembly {{separated from the}} left wing, ripping away a [...] section of the leading edge with it. The combined unit flipped {{over the top of}} the wing and landed on the runway. Robert Graham, supervisor of maintenance for American Airlines, stated: [...] "As {{the aircraft}} got closer, I noticed what appeared to be vapor or smoke of some type coming from the leading edge of the wing and the No. 1 engine pylon. I noticed that the No. 1 engine was bouncing up and down quite a bit and just about the time the aircraft got opposite my position and started rotation, the engine came off, went up {{over the top of the}} wing, and rolled back down onto the runway... Before going over the wing, the engine went forward and up just as if it had lift and was actually climbing. It didn't strike the top of the wing on its way, rather it followed the clear path of the airflow of the wing, up and over the top of it, then down below the tail. The aircraft continued a fairly normal climb until it started a turn to the left. And at that point, I thought he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back to the airport." ...|$|E

In 2009, Rhimes told Entertainment Weekly that she may not have handled the incident correctly, stating: [...] "I wasn't interested in what anybody thought publicly. I was interested in what was going on right here on the ground...with the people I work with every day. Did I do it perfectly? Of course not. This is my first television show. It was a learning experience." [...] Knight said that Rhimes was among those for discouraging him to come out, however Rhimes said: [...] "I remember saying , 'This is our proudest day here. T.R. got to come out and I got to say to him that it wouldn't affect his character' because he was concerned he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out and George would suddenly be gay.

500|$|Ike and Tina began {{a sexual}} {{relationship}} in 1959, much to Tina's chagrin. Ike also felt guilt over the relationship, stating later that having sex with Tina {{felt as if he}} were having sex with a sibling. Recalling to Rolling Stone in 1986, the first time she had sex with Ike Tina said, [...] "He had broken up with the mother of his two sons, who I ended up raising. He was without a girlfriend. One of the musicians said he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to my room and have sex with me. I couldn't lock the door, so I went to sleep with Ike, thinking he would protect me. Shit! It happened then, but I thought, 'Well, okay, I'll just do it once.' Didn't really know what to do because I wasn't turned on to him, even though it was good." [...] In her book, Tina stated the couple married in Tijuana, in 1962. She recalled the first time Ike physically abused her began after she told him she was considering leaving Ike's group due to financial disputes and their own confusing relationship. Tina said Ike grabbed a shoe stretcher and hit her in the head with it. Afterwards, Tina said, Ike asked her to have sex with him. Tina wrote in her memoirs, I, Tina, that the incident was the first time Ike had [...] "instilled fear" [...] in her.|$|E
