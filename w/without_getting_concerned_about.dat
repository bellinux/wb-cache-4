40|$|Cloud Computing will {{surpass the}} Internet in importance; it is a {{relatively}} new technology model of Internet-based computing, whereby information, software, storage, servers and networking are provided on demand. According to different end user requirements, such as data or computing intensive applications are applied in cloud environment. Cloud computing makes computing as a utility and has the potential to transform {{a large part of the}} IT industry, making software even more attractive as a service and shaping the way in which hardware is designed and purchased. We review this cloud computing technologies, and indicate the main challenges for their development in future, among which resource management problem is pointed out and attracts our attention. Combing the current resource management and broker theories, we present new strategy of how to manage resources to deal with different user requirements of cloud services. We described the related work of resource management and broker architecture in this thesis, accomplishing four major research issues. Firstly, we present cloud resource management framework and service-oriented broker to efficiently utilize potential physical resource such as network, storage and computing resources. This framework provides on-demand service to users and optimizes resource utilization by employing virtualization technology. It has the ability to enhance the system performance and satisfy the many of user request. The service-oriented broker is presented in this framework. It is aim to discover, select and reserve the network and end-system resources. It is able to provide guaranteed service by reservation mechanism to meet user's demand. The several scheduling algorithms are employed for finding best match of combined resources. Secondly, we address the problem caused by failure of job submission in cloud environment. We present dynamic resource selection algorithm under user's QoS requirement which would benefit for selecting the best combined resource for real-time multimedia applications. This algorithm is aim to reduce the job fail rate and efficiently utilize network resource to enhance system performance. Thirdly, we solve the virtual network resource allocation problem in cloud computing. We present virtual network- aware resource scheduling algorithm for real-time multimedia applications that is in order to efficiently utilize physical network resources. This algorithm will reduce the physical network traffic and guarantee the service request of the users. Furthermore, the streaming data will be transmitted from selected data source, and then application performance will be maintained. Fourth, we address meta-job scheduling problem for computation application in cloud environment. We present V -heuristic scheduling algorithms for allocation of virtualized network and computing resource. The objective of these scheduling algorithms is aim to achieve high system throughput, improve load balance and minimize meta-job processing time. From the practical aspect, we develop a simulator which is extended from CloudSim simulator. This simulator offers a simulated environment to model this resource management framework. The CloudSim only concentrate on end-system resource <b>without</b> <b>getting</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> virtualization, technology and network resource, so that they can accelerate study progress of new cloud technologies.

40|$|International audienceThe {{design and}} {{development}} of complex artifacts and systems is shifting towards a distributed and collaborative paradigm. The simulation environments for such a paradigm, therefore, need {{to take into account}} the cooperation between design teams, i. e. supporting multidisciplinary simulation in a distributed environment. However, current simulation tools can not fulfil this requirement as they have been developed to solve the specific problems from different disciplines. Although it's already possible to perform multidisciplinary simulations by using several tools together, it is very difficult to implement it when these tools are distributed on the Internet. A solution which can support the integration of distributed simulation models at run-time is presented, involving a computational infrastructure and a high-level modelling approach. Specifically, the infrastructure is constructed by a novel combination of two distributed computing techniques to implement the synchronization of distributed models, as well as to ensure the interoperability at run-time. In addition, a model-driven approach is developed to bridge the high-level model of a simulation system and the infrastructure which implements this model. The solution is evaluated by making a comparison with other approaches, as well as by developing a prototype tool. It's shown in the evaluation that (1) it is viable to develop multidisciplinary simulations in a distributed environment using this solution; (2) the model-driven approach allows designers to focus only on the high-level structure of a design <b>without</b> <b>getting</b> <b>concerned</b> with the details of the infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Com.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2005. Service {{management}} {{is a fascinating}} and complex subject. It is fascinating because, even entities that manufacture products <b>get</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> customer service. Management scientists such as Edward Deming developed a concept known as total quality management (TQM), which has been implemented in manufacturing companies mostly, {{and some of those}} companies include those discussed by Robbins & Decenzo (2001 : 65), namely; General Motors, Ford, & Daimler-Chrysler. This concept TQM is implemented {{in order to make the}} ultimate customer happy and thus creating customer loyalty. If TQM was implemented only for the purpose of quality in products and not involve those employees in support departments such as Finance, Human Resources, Marketing & Sales, Customer Care/Enquiries, within one company, such an endeavour will be rendered ineffective and non-systemic. The service industry is however still lagging behind with it's own innovations. We still yet to see strategies spawned from the service sector. Service in this instance refers to the 'non-product' sector. It is for this reason that this study focuses on service management in the service industry, to make a clear distinction. Service {{management is}} complex. because, as it is argued in this study, it is intangible. The definitions of service developed by many authors such as Gronroos (1990), van Looy et al (2003), and Fitzsimmons & Fitzsimmons (2004), state that service is an activity of more or less intangible nature. They further say that service involves the interaction between a customer and service employees. This is what makes it complex. Service is about people. Zeithaml & Bitner (2000) pointed it out that "the employees delivering the service frequently are the service in the customer's eyes [...] "(pg. 13). Human activity systems, are typically complex, and as such service is likely to be complex because it involves human interaction. Such a complex system is likely to be characterized by complex phenomena. Complex systems are best studied through systems approach. It was in this light that this study is based on a systems inquiry...|$|R

40|$|Seventy years ago, {{night soil}} from Göteborg, Sweden, was transported on barges {{up along the}} Göta River. Farmers in the {{surroundings}} of present Ale kommun used the night soil as a fertilizer. Now recirculation of plant nutrients from urban to rural areas is discussed again. This time the discussion is limited to recirculation of source separated human urine as a valuable fertilizer. Source separated human urine is an alternative to sewage treatment in sewage plants. In Sweden, a couple of pilot projects with human urine have already started, where house owners collect their urine, which is then used as a fertilizer by a farmer in the neighbourhood. Many local authorities are getting interested in this way of treating sewage. This study was made in Ale kommun, close to Göteborg, Sweden. Farmers, property managers and tenants were interviewed about their view of source separated human urine. The three groups interviewed were chosen because they represent the categories primarily involved in a future sewage system change. A qualitative method was used and the interviews were more like a conversation than strictly formal. Fourteen farmers, five property managers and ten tenants were interviewed. The farmers in Ale kommun in general have a positive attitude to using human urine in their production. They think that night soil from the urban areas must {{be returned to the}} fields in one way or another. They themselves would feel more satisfied by using human mine as a fertilizer than using the common manufactured fertilizers. The farmers have the knowledge about circulation of plant nutrients. But they are afraid of what unsuitable substances are poured into the toilets. An understanding between them and the tenants is required for a system with source separated human urine. The farmers' working situation, especially during spring, makes it hard for them to see how much of the manufactured fertilizers {{they would be able to}} replace by human urine. If it was made possible for them to hire labour, his would not be a problem. Nobody wants to drive into town and collect urine with their present equipment. Government regulations seem to be necessary. The fanners still believe that it would be easy to organize some separation of human urine, with one group responsible. Among the property managers there were both those who knew about the plant nutrition content in human urine and those who did not know about its worth at all. The most sceptical ones belonged to the smaller companies. The building sector seem to have <b>gotten</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> environmental questions only this year. A grass root-perspective is obvious, since they hardly want to act without interested tenants. The tenants think that source separated human urine would be more natural than the "rubbish" spread out on the fields today. They believe in recirculation. The usefulness of source separated human urine is not that obvious, though. It is not apparent for everyone why one talks about separating urine.

However, during the recording, Mike (Bryshere Y. Gray) has trouble holding his note, so Bobby starts to clown him for being flat. This started to annoy Mike. Adding insult to injury, they head out to catch a ride in their limo, racing towards the vehicle and Mike misses his opportunity to have his favorite seat. The rest of the group proceeds to clown him more, and Mike decides he would rather catch a cab than deal with their pettiness. He slammed the limo car door in anger. Then, the limo pulls backwards, running over his foot. However, the driver stopped and rushed to Mike, telling him he had thought he had got in. Bobby antagonized the situation more, which led Mike to unleash his anger by spitting in his face. Then, Bobby jumped out of the limos open sunroof window to fight him, with the other boys (Ricky, Ronnie, and Ralph) trying to break the two up. More chain of events happens between Mike and Bobby over a few days, which led to Gary meeting with the group. He tells them that their parents thought it would be best if Mike is disbanded from the group. Bobby spoke up in defense that even though he and Mike both had strong physical disagreements with each other, hes good with him staying. The rest of the group agreed. Mike returns to the studio to record his part and is welcomed back to the group with Bobby first approaching him to apologize. At a dance studio, they have a new choreographer that is teaching them moves to go with the song they just recorded. However, the band mates didnt agree with it. Jheryl felt that things were becoming a disaster and told Greg to fix it, as he already knew who to contact. Weeks later, they take a new cover album photo shoot for their self-titled second album, and Brooke pops up greeting Gary and Jeff. Gary lets it be clear to Brooke, saying that hes only there to do choreography and not playing the role of a manager. Payne takes small offense over it and expresses how it looks to him. However, he tells Gary to make them strong again, while proceeding to surprise the young men, telling them to be ready to get back to work.|$|R
