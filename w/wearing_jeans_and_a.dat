500|$|In 1941 Anderson {{completed}} her PhD at the University of Wisconsin, writing her thesis on [...] "Low energy {{levels in the}} atomic spectra Co VII and Ni VIII". Immediately after finishing her PhD, Anderson requested time off from her position at Milwaukee-Downer College, in order to conduct war research related to the Manhattan Project at the Office of Scientific Research and Development at Princeton University. Not long after, Anderson was recruited to continue her work specifically at Los Alamos Laboratory. At her new location, Anderson studied basic fission parameters, including analyzing the time delays associated with the absorption and emission of neutrons. [...] Such work often entailed working upwards of sixteen hours a day. [...] Among other accomplishments at Los Alamos, Anderson prepared the first sample of pure uranium-235 at the laboratory. While there, {{she lived in a}} dormitory, and being older than most of the other residents (she was aged fifty), she was put in charge. She often worked at night, <b>wearing</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> plaid shirt– not the usual attire for a woman at the time.|$|E

In the 2002 production, the stage was described by one critic as a “bare blank design” with “no relation to domestic realism.” [...] The costumes of the play were as simple as the stage design. Salter always wore a rumpled looking suit, sometimes expensive looking, but sometimes not. The various Bernards usually <b>wore</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> T-shirt, but sometimes a sweatshirt.|$|R
5000|$|Arlo is Janis' husband.

[...] Arlo is drawn wearing a tie when at work, and at home he <b>wears</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> plain T-shirt. His character is generally laid back and ironic. He enjoys barbecues, and dreams and daydreams of sailing. [...] He can be riled by injustice and marauding squirrels. He ponders the meaning of life, monitors his decline, and doesn't get enough exercise. He is in his late 40s.|$|R
2500|$|Bob's Discount Furniture {{is widely}} {{recognized}} for its idiosyncratic advertising. Bob Kaufman {{has been characterized}} as [...] "something of a celebrity in the Northeast, thanks to his quirky television commercials". As of 1997, the company broadcast roughly 500 commercials a week in Connecticut on network and cable television stations. More recently, the commercials have become common during broadcasts of Boston Red Sox and New York Mets games. The commercials usually feature company president Bob Kaufman, typically <b>wearing</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> golf shirt or turtleneck, and have also included Bob's Discount Furniture employees. Cathy Poulin, the company's Director of Public Relations, is the female face of the company. [...] Cathy has been publicly criticized, however, for her contrasting style of dress. [...] Cathy appears in commercials and at events both with and without Bob. [...] "Spanish Bob" [...] William Newton appears in Bob's Discount Furniture commercials for Spanish language stations associated with Univision, Telemundo or other networks. [...] "Clay Bob" [...] has frequent appearances in the company's commercials, often providing seasonal advertisements. The commercials have been characterized as [...] "amateurish", [...] "unconventional", and [...] "wacky", and viewer reaction to the commercials is mixed, with some disliking the advertisements. The advertisements often feature catchphrases, including [...] "Gotcha!", [...] "Untouchable!", [...] "Lickety-split delivery!", [...] "It's a no-brainer!", and most famous (in Bob's early years), [...] "Come on down!".|$|E

5000|$|Carpenter was a {{powerful}} influence on the theatre scene in Liverpool. Though she reportedly knew little about theatre and often got confused with the titles of plays, her enthusiasm and promotion of the theatre was well known locally, earning her the nickname [...] "the Lady Mayoress of Liverpool". During The Blitz of the Second World War, she would reputedly stand {{on the roof of}} the Playhouse yelling [...] "Don't bomb my theatre. Don't bomb my theatre". She once scolded Anthony Hopkins when he turned up at the theatre <b>wearing</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> <b>an</b> open neck shirt, instead of dressing formally. The author Sheila Hancock describes Carpenter as a [...] "local powerhouse". Carpenter married Dr David Farrington in 1919; she died in 1967.|$|R

For one concert at Université Laval that was attended by the university chancellor and the French Consul General he <b>wore</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> red lumberjack shirt. Self-effacing to a fault, he explained, [...] "I started the Goldbergs 'cause I quit smoking and, to keep one's fingers busy, it's better than knitting".|$|R

Palombi entered on stage <b>wearing</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> black shirt to finish the act, and returned in costume after the interval to sing the remainder of the opera.|$|E
30|$|While it is {{important}} to document the existence of other-objectification, it is critical to understand its consequences. Loughnan et al. (2013) conducted an experiment to assess outcomes. In the control condition <b>a</b> woman <b>wore</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> white top. In the experimental condition she wore a bikini. To assess other-objectification, undergraduate men and women rated {{the extent to which the}} stimulus person engaged in mental activities (mind attribution) <b>and</b> completed <b>a</b> moral concern scale. Participants who viewed the bikini-clad woman attributed less mind and less moral concern to her than participants viewing the woman in <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> top, a finding the researchers interpreted as demonstrating sexual objectification of the woman wearing the bikini. Subsequently, participants read a date rape scenario, assessed victim blame, and victim suffering. The woman in a bikini was attributed less suffering but more blame than the woman <b>wearing</b> <b>jeans.</b>|$|R

According to the police, the assassin was a man of 18 to 19 years of age. Two men had been taken into custody in the first hours of the police investigation, but were later released.

The tenor's reaction to his public criticism was denounced as immature and unprofessional by La Scala management and Zeffirelli, who said, [...] "A professional should never behave in this way.

March driver Ivan Capelli secured his first career podium with a brilliant second behind Prost, with Boutsen once again finishing third in his Benetton. As the field finished the first lap of the race, Prost, who had claimed his second pole of the year (and pulled a psychological ploy on Senna by setting his time early in the final session, then spending the rest of the session lounging in the McLaren pits <b>wearing</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> T-shirt, almost daring the Brazilian to beat him), pulled out of Senna's slipstream to pass his teammate for the lead down the straight.
