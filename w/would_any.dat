5|$|In the brain, AVMs {{occasionally}} exert pressure, {{leading to}} headaches. They may {{also increase the}} risk of seizures, as <b>would</b> <b>any</b> abnormal tissue in the brain. Finally, hemorrhage from an AVM may lead to intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding into the brain), which causes any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness in part of the body or difficulty speaking. If the bleeding occurs into the subarachnoid space (subarachnoid hemorrhage), there is usually a severe, sudden headache and decreased level of consciousness and often weakness in part of the body.|$|E

Fox wanted the show to help launch the new network, but wanted it by March 1987, and would only commit to 13 episodes instead of a full season. The unsuccessful negotiations convinced the studio that it could only protect Star Trek with full control.|$|E

25|$|In July 2001, NOAA's Office of Ocean Exploration asked Whiting {{to search}} for the wreck of the U.S. Navy {{submarine}} , which sank 15 nautical miles (28km) off Cape May, New Jersey, in September 1920. Whiting, which had just completed a summer in port at Norfolk, Virginia, and was bound for Boston, Massachusetts, to conduct hydrographic survey operations in New England, paused off Cape May in late July 2001 {{to search for}} the wreck. Whitings survey department approached the project as it <b>would</b> <b>any</b> typical hydrographic survey. Information on snags – obstructions on the ocean bottom that snarl fishing nets and gear – that local recreational fishermen had reported and reports of possible locations of the wreck from divers that had visited it provided Whiting with possible targets for her search. After her crew had prepared a plan for a systematic search, Whiting moved from target cluster to target cluster, mapping the ocean bottom using sidescan sonar. After eight hours of searching, Whiting found the wreck of S-5 directly over one of the suspected targets, made a sonar image of the wreck, and recorded its exact location. Whiting then made several more passes over the wreck to acquire additional images of it at various angles before leaving the scene. NOAA donated the sonar data NOAAS Whiting gathered to the Submarine Force Library and Museum in Groton, Connecticut, for archiving and display.|$|E
500|$|In 1775, the Continental Congress {{decreed that}} no imports {{would enter the}} American colonies, nor <b>would</b> <b>any</b> exports move from America to England. [...] Some historians state that this had a {{profound}} effect on the agriculture of America, while others state that there was no effect as the domestic market was strong enough to sustain American agriculturists. [...] The dispute lies in the fact that the American economy was highly diverse; there was no standard form of currency, and records were not consistently kept.|$|E

500|$|After {{establishing}} that {{he would}} refrain from using extra-Biblical sources to inform his criticism, but would instead apply the Bible's own words against itself, Paine questions the sacredness of the Bible, analyzing it as one <b>would</b> <b>any</b> other book. For example, {{in his analysis of}} the Book of Proverbs he argues that its sayings are [...] "inferior in keenness to the proverbs of the Spaniards, and not more wise and economical than those of the American Franklin". Describing the Bible as [...] "fabulous mythology", Paine questions {{whether or not it was}} revealed to its writers and doubts that the original writers can ever be known (he dismisses the idea that Moses wrote the Pentateuch or that the Gospel's authors are known, for example).|$|E
500|$|Previously, {{important}} help (characterized as [...] "silver bullets") in {{the synthesis}} of superheavy elements came from the deformed nuclear shells around hassium-270 which increased the stability of surrounding nuclei, {{and the existence of}} the quasi-stable neutron-rich isotope calcium-48 which {{could be used as a}} projectile to produce more neutron-rich isotopes of superheavy elements. (The more neutron-rich a superheavy nuclide is, the closer it is expected to be to the sought-after island of stability.) Even so, the synthesized isotopes still have fewer neutrons than those expected to be in the island of stability. Furthermore, using calcium-48 to synthesize unbinilium would require a target of fermium-257, which cannot yet be produced in large enough quantities (only picograms can presently be produced; in comparison, milligrams of berkelium and californium are available), and <b>would</b> <b>any</b> case have a lower yield than using an einsteinium target with calcium-48 projectiles to produce ununennium. More practical production of further superheavy elements would require projectiles heavier than 48Ca, but this has the drawback of resulting in more symmetrical fusion reactions that are colder and less likely to succeed.|$|E
500|$|J. K. Rowling has {{cited the}} Three Witches as an {{influence}} in her Harry Potter series. In {{an interview with}} The Leaky Cauldron and MuggleNet, when asked, [...] "What if [...] never heard the prophecy?", she said, [...] "It's the 'Macbeth' idea. I absolutely adore 'Macbeth.' It is possibly my favourite Shakespeare play. And that's the question isn't it? If Macbeth hadn't met the witches, would he have killed Duncan? <b>Would</b> <b>any</b> of it have happened? Is it fated or did he make it happen? I believe he made it happen." [...] On her website, she referred to Macbeth again in discussing the prophecy: [...] "the prophecy (like the one the witches make to Macbeth, if anyone has read the play of the same name) becomes the catalyst for a situation that would never have occurred {{if it had not}} been made." [...] More playfully, Rowling also invented a musical band popular in the Wizarding world called The Weird Sisters that appears in passing in several books in the series as well as the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. The third Harry Potter movie's soundtrack featured a song by John Williams called [...] "Double Trouble", a reference to the witches' line, [...] "Double double, toil and trouble". The lyrics of the song were adapted from the Three Witches' spell in the play.|$|E

500|$|Linguistic {{amendments}} {{were also}} included; {{the line in}} the preamble emphasising that authors possessed books as they <b>would</b> <b>any</b> other piece of property was dropped, and the bill moved from something designed [...] "for Securing the Property of Copies of Books to the rightful Owners thereof" [...] to a bill [...] "for the Encouragement of Learning, by Vesting the Copies of Printed Books in the Authors or Purchasers of such Copies". Another amendment allowed anyone to own and trade in copies of books, undermining the Stationers. Other changes were made when the bill went to the House of Lords, and it was finally returned to the Commons on 5 April. The aims of the resulting statute are debated; Ronan Deazley suggests that the intent was to balance the rights of the author, publisher and public {{in such a way as}} to ensure the maximum dissemination of works, while other academics argue that the bill was intended to protect the Company's monopoly or, conversely, to weaken it. Oren Bracha, writing in the Berkeley Technology Law Journal, says that when considering which of these options are correct, [...] "the most probable answer [...] all of them". Whatever the motivations, the bill was passed on 5 April 1710, and is commonly known simply as the Statute of Anne due its passage during the reign of Queen Anne.|$|E
