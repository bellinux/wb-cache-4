40|$|In {{responding}} to <b>wrongdoings,</b> people simultaneously pursue {{the goals of}} social control and fairness to the wrongdoer. Social control necessitates stronger weighting of consequences than causes; fairness entails the opposite. The authors hypothesized that the developmental shift from overweighting consequence to overweighting intent when determining levels of punishment illustrates a shift from a default defender of the normative order to a motivated crusader of fairness to the wrongdoer. Thus, punishment should increase slightly for intentional <b>wrongdoings</b> but decrease substantially for accidental <b>wrongdoings</b> as people age. In an experiment on disciplinary action in Singapore, 9 -, 13 -, and 17 -year-olds learned {{about the consequences of}} and intentions behind <b>wrongdoings</b> by peers and predicted consistency of the same act in the future, assigned blame to the wrongdoers, and recommended punishment for them.
