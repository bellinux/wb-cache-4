40|$|Zonadhesin is {{a rapidly}} {{evolving}} protein in the sperm acrosome that confers species specificity to sperm-zona pellucida adhesion. Though structural variation in zonadhesin likely contributes to its species-specific function, the protein has not previously been characterized in organisms capable of interbreeding. Here we compared properties of zonadhesin in several animals, including the horse (Equus caballus), donkey (E. asinus), and Grevy's zebra (E. grevyi) {{to determine if}} variation in zonadhesin correlates <b>with</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> gametes to cross-fertilize. Zonadhesin localized to the apical acrosomes of spermatozoa from all three Equus species, similar to its localization in other animals. Likewise, in horse and donkey testis, zonadhesin was detected only in germ cells, first in the acrosomal granule of round spermatids {{and then in the}} developing acrosomes of elongating spermatids. Among non-Equus species, D 3 -domain polypeptides of mature, processed zonadhesin varied markedly in size and detergent solubility. However, zonadhesin D 3 -domain polypeptides in horse, donkey, and zebra spermatozoa exhibited identical electrophoretic mobility and detergent solubility. Equus zonadhesin D 3 -polypeptides (p 110 /p 80 doublet) were most similar in size to porcine and bovine zonadhesin D 3 -polypeptides (p 105). Sequence comparisons revealed that the horse zonadhesin precursor's domain content and arrangement {{are similar to those of}} zonadhesin from other large animals. Partial sequences of horse and donkey zonadhesin were much more similar to each other (> 99 % identity) than they were to orthologous sequences of human, pig, rabbit, and mouse zonadhesin (52 %– 72 % identity). We conclude that conservation of zonadhesin D 3 -polypeptide properties correlates <b>with</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> Equus species to interbreed...|$|E

Ability of apatite formation on the hybrids was examined in vitro using simulated body fluid (SBF, Kokubo solution).
