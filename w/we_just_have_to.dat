He commented that Pittsburgh has an amazing community of really talented film professionals that’s been built up over the last 20 years. I’ve been blown away by their professionalism, their confidence, their dedication. There aren’t a lot of cities like that. You kind of have to find the city that can be Indianapolis. And Pittsburgh, even though {{it has a lot of}} hills, it can be Indianapolis. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> find a couple of flat streets.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{cautions}} that we cannot feel or intuit {{this world of}} the understanding. He also stresses that {{we are unable to}} make interesting positive claims about it because we are not able to experience the world of the understanding. Kant argues that we cannot use the notion of the world of the understanding to explain how freedom is possible or how pure reason could {{have anything to say about}} practical matters because we simply do not and cannot have a clear enough grasp of the world of the understanding. The notion of an intelligible world does point us towards the idea of a kingdom of ends, which is a useful and important idea. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be careful not to get carried away and make claims that we are not entitled to.|$|E

Death may be tragic but it is commonplace, the eternal Truth. Let's not trumpet it, but place it simply before the public and let them make up their own minds. I would so like the feeling that we generate on the air to reflect the reality of death in life: {{most of the time it}} is a very quiet, private affair, generates little public attention: we grieve, and then somehow or other <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> get on with things. I suppose at the risk of sounding squirmingly precious, I would like Victor to die with dignity.|$|E
5000|$|After {{qualifying}} {{seventh and}} being all but guaranteed into the Daytona 500 based on speed, Ryan Blaney {{said that he}} [...] "wasn't really too nervous going into today. I knew we had a really fast race car. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do our job {{and we did it}} and <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> lock ourselves in.

[...] "In terms of compensation, the word satisfaction doesn’t even enter the equation," [...] Jiyuan remarked. [...] "But this is the result, so <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> accept it." [...] Reactions on Chinese social media were mixed, and some commented that the government had gotten too lenient a consequence. [...] International activists said the settlement of Feng's case was just the beginning of the fight to end the one-child policy, with Bob Fu of ChinaAid remarking, [...] "The bottom line is there are hundreds and thousands of [...] Feng Jianmei." [...] As of July 13, the family had not received the promised compensation and Jiyuan told reporters he was not sure if it would ever come.|$|E

When scholars say the text is of an extremist character, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> respond". The appeal was scheduled for hearing by the Tomsk regional court on March 6, 2012 but was later rescheduled for March 20.|$|E

2500|$|On May 11, over 5,000 people {{marched in}} support of the {{striking}} hospital workers-including United Auto Workers president Walter Reuther and five U.S. Congressmen.

2500|$|Joel David Hamkins {{proposes a}} multiverse {{approach}} to set theory {{and argues that}} [...] "the continuum hypothesis is settled on the multiverse view by our extensive knowledge about how it behaves in the multiverse, and, as a result, {{it can no longer}} be settled in the manner formerly hoped for." [...] (Hamkins 2012). In a related vein, Saharon Shelah wrote that he does [...] "not agree with the pure Platonic view that the interesting problems in set theory can be decided, that <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> discover the additional axiom. My mental picture is that we have many possible set theories, all conforming to ZFC." [...] (Shelah 2003).|$|E
5000|$|In 2015-16, Keene <b>had</b> <b>to</b> sit out {{his first}} season at Central Michigan due to NCAA {{transfer}} eligibility rules. During that season he played as a scout teamer against the starters but he frequently dominated them. One time, Keene scored 37 points against them in a scrimmage. Fellow guard Braylon Rayson said, [...] "We couldn’t do nothing with him. It was {{to the point where}} <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> live with it." ...|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the weather}} and lack of {{equipment}}, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> carry all our heavy equipment back to Mount Kent, instead of being flown there. That was psychologically the toughest thing I'd ever done. You're walking and falling, walking and falling—some of the lads carrying up to a hundred pounds—and if you fell over, it took two guys to lift you back up. Then there {{was the lack of}} sleep, the wet, the cold, the diarrhea.|$|R
5000|$|She Had to Say Yes is a 1933 American pre-Code film {{directed}} by George Amy and Busby Berkley. It was Berkley's directorial debut. Loretta Young {{stars as a}} secretary who receives unwanted sexual advances when she is sent out on dates with her employer's clients. The film was promoted with the teaser, [...] "We apologize to the men for the many frank revelations made by this picture, but <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> show it as it was filmed. The true story of the working girl." ...|$|R
2500|$|With 28 laps to go, Ryan Newman {{lost the}} lead to Joey Logano and he held off a hard-charging Kyle Larson to score his fifth win of the season. “It was a crazy race, and I had such a fast Pennzoil Ford," [...] said Logano. [...] "It is awesome {{to be back in}} victory lane. When the top opened up, the car just took off. Me and the No. 42 (Kyle Larson) were the only ones that seemed to be able to run up there. We had a cat and mouse (with Larson) during {{portions}} of the late run. I just {{had to be able to}} work the traffic and keep my momentum up. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> keep capitalizing going forward.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The 2002 {{season was}} the first in which Coulthard was the more {{experienced}} driver in his team. He was optimistic for the new season, saying: [...] "If they need an opinion then they have to come to me this year. In the past they didn't. But that said, it's important for me not to get bogged down in the history of what happened in the past. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go forward." [...] He endured a torrid start: Coulthard's car suffered from gearbox issues and retired after 35 laps; and in the following race in Malaysia, both cars retired from engine failure after 24 laps. Two weeks later in the Brazilian Grand Prix, Coulthard secured his first podium of the season with a third-place finish. The start managed to get better as Coulthard took four consecutive finishes inside of the points; this included his only victory of the season in Monaco.|$|E
2500|$|... "As {{far as the}} {{expression}} 'Failure is not an option,' you are correct that Kranz never used that term. In preparation for the movie, the script writers, Al Reinart and Bill Broyles, came down to Clear Lake to interview me on 'What are the people in Mission Control really like?' One of their questions was 'Weren't there times when everybody, {{or at least a}} few people, just panicked?' My answer was 'No, when bad things happened, we just calmly laid out all the options, and failure was not one of them. We never panicked, and we never gave up on finding a solution.' I immediately sensed that Bill Broyles wanted to leave and assumed that he was bored with the interview. Only months later did I learn that when they got in their car to leave, he started screaming, 'That's it! That's the tag line for the whole movie, Failure is not an option. Now <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> figure out who to have say it.' Of course, they gave it to the Kranz character, and the rest is history." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone following the first reunion show Only {{was asked about the}} future of the Misfits, and if there were plans to continue and possibly record new music.

And that's where we're at. Whatever it takes. We're going into our 40th anniversary so the timing couldn't be more perfect. Eventually Doyle's got to write a new album; I've got to write a new album; Glenn's got to write a new album. Why don't we work together and make the greatest album ever? Now we've got different elements. We've got Doyle playing more of a metal kind of thing. We've got Dave, who we're trying to figure out what the fuck he's doing. And Glenn's got his own thing. And Acey [...] fills in good, too. And I've got the band where it is today. So it's a matter of re-molding and using all the different elements that I've got." [...] When asked if Danzig would want to record new music Only said, [...] "I think it's got to evolve naturally. The thing is we've tried to plan things, and then we stand there and wait, and as it comes we'll just do it. When we go back — I don't know about Glenn — but I canceled our touring and everything for this, so I'm going to go home and write and lift." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bayern did not {{contest the}} Belmont Stakes and was instead {{aimed at the}} seven-furlong Woody Stephens Stakes at the same meeting. He contested the early lead before taking a clear {{advantage}} entering the straight and drew away in the closing stages to win by {{seven and a half}} lengths from Top Fortitude. His winning time of 1:20.75 was less than a second off the track record. [...] Stevens returned as his jockey and said, [...] "That was a powerhouse performance. He had a bad experience in the gate in the Preakness. Jimmy Barnes [...] and Bob's crew did a great job getting him ready by schooling, schooling, schooling him." [...] Bayern was moved back up in class and distance for the Grade I Haskell Invitational over nine furlongs at Monmouth Park on July 27. Ridden for the first time by Martin Garcia, he was the second choice in the betting behind the filly Untapable. Garcia took the lead from the start and set a steady pace before drawing away in the straight to win by more than seven lengths from Albano, with Untapable in fifth place. Baffert, who won the race for a record seventh time, watched the running on television. After the race, the trainer, who said that he had considered keeping the horse to sprint distances, stated, [...] "We tried to slow him down in the past, but now we know <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> utilize his speed. I didn't think he'd do it as devastating as that. It looks like he has it all together now." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{reducing}} Buemi's lead by 22 {{points in}} the preceding New York City ePrix, di Grassi stated that his team had to improve vastly in gaining any hope of winning the championship in Montreal and was feeling more confident that he previously been: [...] "With the experience that I have with Formula E, {{you know that it}} can go from hell to heaven any weekend, any race. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do our best, try and win both races and see how it goes." [...] Buemi, the pre-title favourite, missed the New York City races because of a World Endurance Championship commitment at the Nürburgring, but stated he would prepare for the Montreal events the same way as he would with any other ePrix: [...] "We will try to do the best possible. I hope we can finish this season in style and look forward to it." [...] He created controversy when he raised the issue of his crash with di Grassi at the 2016 London ePrix, saying: [...] "If [...] happens once more like this, what do you think people will think then? It will be very hard to explain for him. He can’t afford anything like that again for his reputation, can he?" [...] Di Grassi responded by noting Buemi lost the first season championship through a driver error and said Buemi had more pressure and another mistake would prevent him from reclaiming the championship: [...] "Everyone feels pressure in a different way of course. He has pressure big time this weekend, much more than me, this is because everyone will be waiting to see if those mistakes come again in Montreal." ...|$|E

The songs were produced and recorded {{for the most part}} at Olympic Studios in Barnes, London. At this time, the Autotune facility was not available and most of the vocals were recorded with few adjustments made afterwards, as Wilson remembers: [...] "Because of the fact we were not using computers, we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> work them very hard.

But it is much worse now, very much worse. You see, when we were going the other way, if we found them at one place we could go on to another, but when we are going north we cannot always do that. We cannot go any faster than Jack Frost does. Sometimes we are driven out of a place by the bang, bang of the terrible guns and go on, only to find that we have caught up with Jack Frost, and that the ponds and the rivers are still covered with ice. Then there is nothing to do but to turn back to where those terrible guns are waiting for us. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> <b>HAVE</b> <b>to</b> do it." ...|$|E

Kennedy (the latter song's figurative [...] "ray of hope" [...] is surviving Kennedy brother Edward Kennedy).

That affected the tom-toms and guitars and keyboards which were playing along at the time. There was no way of saving it, so <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do it yet again.

Production for The Wanderer was rushed, Geffen wanted to get new product out because of Casablanca's plans to release Walk Away, another greatest hits collection.
