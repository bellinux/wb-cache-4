5|$|Wind {{tunnel and}} flight {{simulator}} {{tests were conducted}} to help to understand the trajectory of the aircraft after the engine detached and the left wing slats retracted. Those tests established that {{the damage to the}} wing's leading edge and retraction of the slats increased the stall speed of the left wing from 124 knots (143mph) to 159 knots (183mph). The DC-10 incorporates two <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> that might have alerted the pilots to the impending stall: the slat disagreement warning light, which should have illuminated after the uncommanded retraction of the slats, and the stick shaker on the captain's control column, which activates close to the stall speed. Both of these <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> were powered by an electric generator driven by the number one engine. Both systems became inoperative after the loss of that engine. The first officer's control column was not equipped with a stick shaker; the device was offered by McDonnell Douglas as an option for the first officer, but American Airlines chose not to have it installed on its DC-10 fleet. Stick shakers for both pilots became mandatory in response to this accident.|$|E

25|$|The {{aircraft}} had no {{fire detection}} or <b>warning</b> <b>devices.</b> But it had two built-in CO2 fire extinguishers to fight engine fires. The extinguishers were not automatic. There was a control {{panel on the}} starboard side of the cockpit, from which the co-pilot would operate the extinguishers when instructed by the pilot. Investigators found that both of the extinguishers had been discharged. This suggested that {{a member of the}} crew, presumably the co-pilot, Warrant Officer Bro≈æ, had tried to extinguish the engine fire.|$|E

25|$|According to Federal Railroad Administration {{data from}} 2004, there were 215,224 {{railroad}} crossings in the U.S., of which 1,098 were listed as having {{one or more}} wigwags as their <b>warning</b> <b>device.</b> This is a reduction from 1983 information from the Federal Highway Administration (FRA) that showed 2,618 crossings equipped with wigwags. Of these 1,098 crossings having wigwags, 398 are in California, 117 in Wisconsin, 97 in Illinois, 66 are in Texas and 45 are in Kansas. A total of 44 states {{have at least one}} railroad crossing having a wigwag as its <b>warning</b> <b>device.</b>|$|R
2500|$|BART has {{installed}} {{and continues to}} enhance a network of seismic sensors (an earthquake warning system) to trigger a system halt {{in the event of}} a major event, this to include automated event progression analysis to determine the best action with regard to individual trains for maximum safety (a fault rip can take up to several tens of seconds to completely propagate from the epicenter to the more distant affected locations). Such sensor networks and <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> have a potential to reduce the hazards from falling objects and furnishings provided that the people notified are well trained in appropriate responses (similar to the Cold War's [...] "duck and cover" [...] training of schoolchildren).|$|E
2500|$|As far as warning {{systems for}} road users are concerned, level {{crossings}} either have [...] "passive" [...] protection, {{in the form}} of various types of warning signs, or [...] "active" [...] protection, using automatic <b>warning</b> <b>devices</b> such as flashing lights, warning tones and barriers or gates. Fewer collisions take place at level crossings with active warning systems. Modern radar sensor systems can detect if level crossings are free of obstructions as trains approach. [...] These improve safety by not lowering crossing barriers that may trap vehicles or pedestrians on the tracks, while signalling trains to brake until the obstruction clears (however, they cannot prevent a vehicle from moving out onto the track once it's far too late for the locomotive to slow even slightly).|$|E
2500|$|By {{the spring}} of 1935, GEMA's successes {{made it clear to}} Runge that the idea was {{workable}} after all, so he started a crash program at Telefunken to develop radar systems. With Lorenz already making progress on early <b>warning</b> <b>devices,</b> Runge had the Telefunken team concentrate on a short-range gun laying system instead. Management apparently felt it to be as uninteresting as Runge had a year earlier and assigned it a low priority for development. By the summer they had built a working experimental unit in the [...] band that was able to generate strong returns off a target Junkers Ju 52. By the next summer, the experimental set-up had been developed into a prototype known as the Darmstadt, which offered a range accuracy of [...] at , not nearly enough for gun laying. Attitudes changed in late 1938, when a full development contract was received from the Luftwaffe.|$|E

40|$|Poor {{air quality}} in schools has been {{associated}} with adverse health effects. Indoor air quality can be improved by increasing ventilation. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the effectiveness of different interventions to improve ventilation behavior in primary schools. We used indoor CO(2) concentrations as an indicator. In 81 classes of 20 Dutch primary schools, we applied three different interventions: (i) a class-specific ventilation advice; (ii) the advice combined with a CO(2) <b>warning</b> <b>device</b> and (iii) the advice combined with a teaching package. The effectiveness of the interventions was tested directly after intervention and 6 weeks after intervention by measuring the CO(2) concentrations and comparison with a control group (iv). Before intervention, the CO(2) concentration exceeded 1000 ppm for 64 % of the school day. The class-specific ventilation advice without further support appeared an ineffective tool to improve ventilation behavior. The advice in combination with a CO(2) <b>warning</b> <b>device</b> or the teaching package proved effective tools and resulted in lower indoor CO(2) concentrations when compared with the control group. Ventilation was significantly improved, but CO(2) concentrations still exceeded 1000 ppm for more than 40 % of the school day. Hence, until ventilation facilities are upgraded, the CO(2) <b>warning</b> <b>device</b> and the teaching package are useful low-cost tools. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: To improve ventilation behavior and indoor air quality in schools, CO(2) <b>warning</b> <b>device</b> and teaching package combined with a class-specific ventilation advice, are effective tools, while giving the ventilation advice solely, is not effective. Although ventilation is significantly improved through behavioral change, the ventilation rate is still insufficient to maintain good air quality during the full school day. Therefore, the improvement of the ventilation facilities is recommended. Hence, until ventilation facilities in schools are upgraded, the CO(2) <b>warning</b> <b>device</b> and the teaching package are useful low-cost tools to improve current indoor air quality...|$|R

Following their {{replacement}} in the air defence role by the Mirage 2000, the French Air Force {{had a number of}} surplus Mirage F1C-200s, and in 1988 it launched a conversion programme to turn these aircraft into interim ground attack aircraft to replace elderly Mirage IIIEs and Mirage Vs. The Mirage F1CT program brought the avionics of the F1C up to the standard of the F1CR, with the radar upgraded with the additional air-to-ground modes of the Cyrano IVM-R, an improved navigation/attack system fitted, with a laser rangefinder fitted under the nose. [...] It was fitted with new Mk 10 ejection seats, while improved radar detection and <b>warning</b> <b>devices,</b> chaff/flare dispensers, and secure radios were also added.

2500|$|Supplies and {{ammunition}} {{were brought up}} towards the position along the steep slope from the Komiatum Ridge, and on 20 June, Japanese patrols from the 66th, with guides from the 102nd, began probing the Australian position on Lababia Ridge, which was held by about 80 men. Japanese sappers defused the booby traps that the Australians had created out of piano wire and hand grenades, but being unfamiliar with the mechanisms of the Australian grenades, left them in place, rather than using them against the defenders. Sporadic firing occurred throughout the day, but no major attack developed. The following day, 21 June, Australian patrols noticed signs of Japanese activity along the track towards the observation post that had been established further east along the ridge. Around 07:30 the telephone line to the post was cut and shortly afterwards, Japanese troops approaching the main Australian position began setting off booby traps {{that had been set}} up as early <b>warning</b> <b>devices.</b> Around 14:00 the Japanese launched an assault from the north and north-east of the Australian position, supported by mortars. This was repelled, but followed up by another attack in the early afternoon, including a bayonet charge. Over the course of the afternoon, a total three attacks were made to the sound of bugle calls. While intended to frighten the Australian soldiers, these actually served to warn the defenders of their approach.|$|E
