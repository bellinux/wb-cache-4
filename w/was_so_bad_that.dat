5|$|After the war, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that most holiday camps in Britain had been damaged by troop occupation, and the situation <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> questions were raised in parliament. Other than Clacton, the Butlins camps were relatively unscathed, and even Clacton, which had been damaged by troop occupation, re-opened in early 1946. In the post-war boom Butlin saw opportunities on foreign shores. He opened camps at Mosney, in the soon to be Republic of Ireland, in 1948 and on Grand Bahama, in 1949.|$|E
5|$|The {{next year}} in 1962, the Red Sox {{had been in the}} middle of a streak of 8 losing seasons. The team <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad,</b> <b>that</b> after a 13-3 loss to the Yankees on July 26, Red Sox ace Gene Conley got off the bus and {{attempted}} to leave the country and go to Israel. Conley was denied his request because he did not have a passport. Nonetheless, Conley did stay away from the team for 3 days.|$|E
5|$|Bliss {{was left}} in the strong room for three weeks wearing a {{skullcap}} (a heavy vice for the head), thumb screws, iron collar, leg irons, and irons round his ankles called sheers. One witness said the swelling in his legs <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> the irons on one side could no longer be seen for overflowing flesh. His wife, who was able to see him through a small hole in the door, testified that he was bleeding from the mouth and thumbs. He was given a small amount of food but the skullcap prevented him from chewing; he had to ask another prisoner, Susannah Dodd, to chew his meat for him. He was eventually released from the prison, but his health deteriorated and he died in St. Thomas's Hospital.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1933, MGM staff {{realized}} that additional footage was needed to complete the film. This involved casting an actress for the role. The production staff visited San Francisco, California, to identify an actress for a minor female part. Ray Mala offered the role of Iva to Sadie Brower, a 17-year-old half-Inupiat girl. But after her father refused to let her appear in movies, a Japanese American (who could not speak any Eskimo) was cast in the role instead. According to Brower, this woman's Eskimo <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> it was unintelligible. Dortuk, Elik, Kemasuk, Nunooruk, and four other Inupiat actors were brought to California {{to act in the}} reshoots and new scenes.|$|E
5|$|Although Gambier had no {{intention}} of risking his fleet in the narrow waters of Basque Roads, he had permitted three more transports to be fitted out as fireships, and at 17:30 these were led into the anchorage by Stopford in Caesar, accompanied by Theseus and several launches quipped to fire Congreve rockets. At 19:40 however Caesar grounded on a shoal and remained stuck there until 22:30, close to Valiant, which had also grounded at low tide. At this point six surviving French ships; Océan, four of the line and the frigate Indienne, remained aground close to the mouth of the Charente, while the remainder of the fleet had escaped upriver to secure anchorages. During the night the wind blew from the land, rendering a fireship attack impractical, and so the British contented themselves with setting Ville de Varsouvie and Aquilon on fire, both ships determined by John Bligh on Valiant, over Cochrane's objections, to have been damaged beyond repair. During this operation, one of the new fireships was wrecked on a shoal. The weather <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> night that the planned attack with the remaining fireships was abandoned as unfeasible.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the coral}} reef, {{conventional}} landing craft {{could not be}} used for the landing at Papitalai Mission. The five LVTs, one a combat type and the other four cargo-carrying, set out from Hyane Harbour to Salami Plantation but the road <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> only the combat and one cargo LVT were available in time. The attack went ahead anyway, preceded by an airstrike and artillery bombardment by the 271st Field Artillery Battalion. The combat LVT fired 24M8 4.5-inch rockets. Return fire was received from Japanese mortars and machine guns, and a 75mm howitzer. The first wave had to hold alone in the face of fire from Japanese bunkers for 45minutes until the LVTs returned with the next wave. Later, they fought off a counterattack by about 30Japanese. Joined by a third LVT which had eventually managed to make it to Salami, the LVTs made 16trips across the harbour before nightfall curtailed operations, transporting part of the 2ndSquadron, 12thCavalry, along with rations, water and ammunition, and evacuating the dead and wounded.|$|E

40|$|Most {{of us have}} an {{intuitive}} idea of what secularization is and are probably more or less convinced that we know it when we see it. And chances are that, for many of us, the image that lodges in our minds causes us to view it with some alarm. To borrow {{a line from the}} old Johnny Carson Show routine, “How bad is it? ” Here are a few possible responses. (The figures have been obtained from a data set furnished by the MicroCase Corporation. See Barkan, 1998.) * It <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>that,</b> whereas in 1978 only a third of Americans approved of legal abortion for any reason by 1996 this figure had climbed to forty–five percent. * It <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> the percentage of people saying that premarital sex is NOT wrong rose from 27 % in 1972 to 43 % in 1996 (the last year for which figures were available). * It <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> the percentage of Americans saying that homosexual sex is ALWAYS WRONG declined from 75 % in 1990 to just 60 % in 1996. * In fact it <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> when my pastor referred to the “S ” word last Sunday, I didn't know whether he was talking about secularization or––that other “S ” word.

5|$|Buckingham Palace finally {{became the}} {{principal}} royal residence in 1837, on the accession of Queen Victoria, {{who was the}} first monarch to reside there; her predecessor WilliamIV had died before its completion. While the state rooms were a riot of gilt and colour, the necessities of the new palace were somewhat less luxurious. For one thing, it was reported the chimneys smoked so much that the fires had to be allowed to die down, and consequently the court shivered in icy magnificence. Ventilation <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> the interior smelled, and when it was decided to install gas lamps, there was a serious worry about the build-up of gas on the lower floors. It was also said that staff were lax and lazy and the palace was dirty. Following the Queen's marriage in 1840, her husband, Prince Albert, concerned himself with a reorganisation of the household offices and staff, and with the design faults of the palace. The problems were all rectified by the close of 1840. However, the builders were to return within the decade.|$|E
5|$|Caio Duilios next {{operation}} was a sortie against the British convoy MW 9 bounded from Alexandria to Malta in February. She departed from Taranto on 14 February {{with a pair}} of light cruisers and seven destroyers, but the force could not locate the British ships, and so returned to port. Her mere presence at sea, however, forced the British escort to scuttle the transport Rowallan Castle, previously disabled by German aircraft. On the 21st, she escorted the convoy K7 from Messina and Corfu to Taranto. By this point in 1942, the Italian fleet began to suffer a severe shortage of fuel, which curtailed its operations. The situation <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> Caio Duilio had to be placed in reserve and drained of fuel, {{in order to keep the}} escort craft operational. She was at Taranto when Italy surrendered to the Allies in September 1943, and on 9 September she was taken to Malta, where she was interned with the rest of the Italian fleet.|$|E

25|$|In early 1787, encroachments by American {{settlers}} {{became so}} great that the Overhill Towns held a council on whether to completely abandon their homes on the Little Tennessee for more removed locations to the west.

The situation of the Overhill Cherokee <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> refugees appeared in Muscogee towns, and the Chickasaw threatened to break the treaty of 1783 and go on the warpath if something were not done to alleviate the situation.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there were}} serious problems. The costs of {{developing}} the new cars and engines meant managers now had problems in securing working capital to keep the company going. American Motors' automobile sales dropped twenty {{percent in the first}} half of 1966, and the firm reported a fiscal six-month loss of $4.2 million on sales of $479 million. The situation <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> Robert B.

25|$|Despite {{its modern}} conveniences, one problem on Pentowna was vibration.

Because of these deficiencies and because new highways and modes of transportation meant fewer passengers, Pentowna was converted into a cargo tug in 1937. The job was given to North Vancouver Shipyards Ltd., who installed a new steel deck and towing machinery and stripped off Pentowna's upper structures. The galley was moved to the top deck and the life boats were raised. After a two-month layover, Pentowna went back into service as a freight ship.|$|E
25|$|Bevan {{was born}} in Tredegar, Monmouthshire, in the South Wales Valleys and on the {{northern}} edge of the South Wales coalfield, the son of coal miner David Bevan and Phoebe (née Prothero), a seamstress.

One of ten children, Bevan did poorly at school and his academic performance <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad,</b> <b>that</b> his headmaster made him repeat a year. At the age of thirteen, Bevan left school and began working in the local Ty-Trist Colliery.

25|$|Racist {{attitudes towards}} the Haitian {{people by the}} American {{occupation}} forces were blatant and widespread. Initially, there was intermingling of officers and the elites at social gatherings and clubs but when families of American forces began arriving, such gatherings were minimized. Relations degraded rapidly, however, upon departure of officers for World War I in Europe; this {{changed the nature of}} the relationship between the races the most. The Haitian elite found the American junior and non-commissioned officers to be ignorant and uneducated. There were numerous reports of remaining Marines drinking to excess, fighting and sexually assaulting women. The situation <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>bad</b> <b>that</b> the Marine General John A.
