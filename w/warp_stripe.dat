40|$|More than a {{thousand}} years ago, Baghdad was capital of the Islamic empire under the Abbasid caliphs, and Yemen was a flourishing center of agriculture and trade. Among its famous products were dyestuffs, and cotton cloth with <b>warp</b> <b>stripes,</b> patterned using techniques of compression resist. As {{the strength of the}} Abbasid caliphate declined and claims to power gained hold in the provinces, regional artistic styles began to emerge. The rulers of Yemen adopted one of the prerogatives of the Abbasid caliphs, bestowing honor by rewarding their subjects with inscribed textiles called tiraz. From burial sites in Egypt, many such textiles have survived in fragmentary condition, often with warp fringes, and occasionally with Arabic inscriptions bearing historical names and dates, Qur’anic excerpts, and pious invocations. Acquired by dealers {{in the middle of the}} 20 th century, they found their way to museums in Europe and North Americ...|$|R
50|$|Since 1993 Roger Oates {{has sold}} Venetian flatweave, {{designed}} and woven in the United Kingdom on specially adapted narrow width looms for floor runners. The heavy woven fabric is fitted onto staircases by trained fitters, {{and can be}} fitted around corners and on winding stairs. The <b>warp</b> is always <b>striped,</b> and so the company produces a variety of stripe designs. A line of tartan fabrics has also been created.|$|R
50|$|The weavers use a {{primitive}} type of throw-shuttle pit looms {{for the production}} of exclusively cotton fabrics with pure zeri.

Identical appearance of designs, including <b>warp</b> and weft <b>stripes</b> on the face and backside of the fabric is obtained by this technique of weaving.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION Textile {{production}} in Guatemala {{has been the}} focus of a considerable amount of twentieth century literature in the English language. Guatemalan textiles have been avidly collected by museums, universities and private collectors in North America and Europe. Our belief as researchers and collectors is that we are recording and preserving the valuable textile traditions of the indigenous people of Guatemala. What we often don 2 ̆ 7 t realize is that collectively, over time, we are saying as much about our own perspective as outsiders as we are about the Guatemalan people and their textiles. Our choices of what to document and what to collect reflect our own biases. As important as what we choose to study and collect is what we do not select. One type of textile which is ubiquitous to the region but consistently overlooked is the woollen blanket of Momostenango. Because their format and function are familiar to outsiders and because they are routinely sold to tourists, the blankets and related woollen textiles have not been considered worthy of research or collection. By examining this example of omission, this paper considers our collecting and research practices, particularly as they relate to tourist textiles. The long term impact of our attitudes may be to limit the capacity of the literature and collections to record the full range of textile traditions in Guatemala. THE MOMOSTENANGO BLANKET For the purposes of this paper, I am using the Momostenango blanket as an archetypical example of what has generally not been collected among Guatemalan textiles. This paper is not about Momostenango woollen textiles per se but more about our collective attitudes to trade goods, particularly widely distributed items and more particularly, items included in the tourist trade. For anyone not familiar with the ubiquitous Momostenango blanket, I will provide a brief visual and verbal description. Most blankets commonly seen by visitors are made of a weft faced brushed wool either on a wool or cotton warp. Patterns are created by the use of discontinuous wefts using a dovetail join, or by double faced supplementary wefts. Blanket patterns can also be formed using <b>warp</b> <b>striping,</b> weft striping or twill checks and plaids, although these latter techniques are more common in blankets not aimed at the tourist market. Patterns include versions of many of the images found in other Guatemalan textiles such as munjecas or human forms, animals such as horse or deer, assorted birds including the tourist industry favoured quetzal, various plant forms and geometries. Colours include natural whites, blacks and grays as well as a variety of commercial dye colours such as blue, red, yellow, brown, purple or green. Natural dyes were used before commercial dyes were available...|$|R
40|$|Small {{fragment}} of woven wool fabric with yellow <b>warp</b> and weft <b>stripes</b> as follows:; yellow 2 cm; blue 0. 2 cm - 9 picks; yellow 2 picks; blue 0. 2 cm - 9 picks; yellow 2. 6 cm; red 0. 5 cm; The {{edge of the}} red band {{appears to be the}} end (or beginning) of the weaving. There are warp loops visible. There are also small remnants of possible yellow weft twining at this edge. The red may be a tapestry band because, although the red ends at an edge tear, the piece of fabric {{on the other side of}} the tear is all yellow.; Fairly clean but very worn. There is a small interior hole and several edge tears. There are some missing warps down the center. Edges are frayed. The red color is very bright and fresh appearing and has some luster...|$|R
40|$|Since 1986, I {{have been}} {{pursuing}} my passionate interest in handwoven velvet, both practically and academically. By velvet, I mean extra-warp pile, rather than weft-woven types of pile, such as weft-looping or knotting. Simple, monochrome plain velvets have been woven {{since the early}} Coptic period, requiring only simple looms and two simple warp tensioning systems, one for the foundation cloth and another for the pile warp. 1 (On the basis of such a simple set-up, early velvet figuration could be created through the following colour effects using: (a) striped pile warp; (b) ikat/chiné (spaced dyed) pile warp; (c) painted or printed pile warp; (d) 2 <b>striped</b> <b>warps</b> mounted counterchange style (e. g. DLDLDL/LDLDLD); or (e) 2 contrasting warps, motifs picked up by hand or held {{on a set of}} half-heddle rods. Simple textural effects include: (a) alternating stripes or bands of velvet (cut and/or uncut) and flat cloth; and (b) bands of differing heights of pile (cut or uncut). All of the above variations can be created using simple looms with as few as three or four shafts. 2 For example, the elaborate figuration of Uzbeki velvet ikats is provided by the ikat dyed patterning of the pile warp, which is then woven as a “solid” velvet, whose pile uniformly covers the whole fabric surface. 3 This velvet can be woven on a 4 shaft counter-balanced loom with both foundation warp and pile warp separately tensioned with “live” or gravity weighting provided by bags of bricks. Solid velvet pile warps can also be mounted on a single warp beam with uniform tension because all the pile warps are taken up identically. Examples of chequered patterning in silk velvets date back at least to the 11 th century. 4 Simple counterchange chequered designs can be woven with a minimum of two pile shafts and two pile warps, one of each of two contrasting colours. The two contrasting colours, let us say L 2 ̆ 6 D, can also be wound together as a pair and mounted as a single pile warp in which the two colours alternate. A 4 -shaft loom is sufficient for such patterns. To create the chequered pattern, the pile shafts 3 and 4 are ordered in blocks as follows: 3 rd shaft – LDLDLD… DLDLDL… 4 th shaft – DLDLDL… LDLDLD… Although the loom mounting for a chequered velvet is simple, the alternation of colours, although likely balanced over the whole piece, requires a separate tension for the ends on each of the two pile shafts. This is best facilitated by weighting the ends of each pile shaft separately on uniformly tensioned warp beams or with live weights. Without separate tension, a recurring build-up of slack pile ends will interfere with smooth weaving and an even pile height...|$|R
