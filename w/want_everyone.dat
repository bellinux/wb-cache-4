5|$|Leslie, Tom (Aziz Ansari), and Jerry join Carl {{to take a}} tour of {{the park}} where Jerry was mugged. Carl says the area is largely {{unprotected}} due to budget cuts, so Leslie vows to get more funding. She appears on Pawnee Today, the local news show, saying the Pawnee government failed the parks and that security is poor. Paul (Phil Reeves), the city manager, is angry over the television appearance, but informs Leslie the stunt worked and the mayor is offering $2,500 to help fix the park. While at a press conference about the money, Jerry confesses to Leslie that he wasn't mugged: he dropped a breakfast burrito in a creek, then fell while trying to grab it and dislocated his shoulder. He fabricated the mugger story because he was embarrassed and didn't <b>want</b> <b>everyone</b> to make fun of him. Leslie angrily relates Jerry's story to Mark, but he stops her short when he says that Jerry was too scared of his co-workers to be honest with them. Leslie soon discovers Carl was offended by Leslie's statements about park security and plans to show footage of Jerry falling into the creek on Pawnee Today. Leslie negotiates with Carl to not show the event, and instead they talk during the show about how much they enjoyed the film Avatar, much to the anger of host Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins). As part of their deal to not show the tape, Leslie buys Carl a brand new security cart. Carl hands over the tape, which she agrees to throw away after she watches it one last time. The office goes back to mocking Jerry, but with less venom than before, while Jerry confides that he doesn't really care because he's just two years away from retiring on a full pension and enjoying a peaceful retirement.|$|E

500|$|According to Eisenstein, Beth Hamedrash Hagodol {{provided}} {{an atmosphere that}} was [...] "socially religious", in which Jews [...] "combine piety with pleasure; they call their shule a shtibl or prayer-club room; they desire to be on familiar terms with the Almighty and abhor decorum; they <b>want</b> <b>everyone</b> present to join and chant the prayers; above all they scorn a regularly ordained cantor." [...] In contrast to the informality of the services, members scrupulously observed the Jewish dietary laws, and every member personally oversaw the baking of his matzos for use on Passover.|$|E

500|$|Record {{producer}} and DJ Ali Shaheed Muhammad, credited for programming on the album, assisted in its production. He cited the group's fusion of hip hop production and live instrumentation for Sons of Soul as {{the inspiration for}} his subsequent work {{as a member of}} A Tribe Called Quest and The Ummah. Muhammad discussed his experience recording Sons of Soul in a 1998 interview, saying that [...] "I'd just hooked this beat up, and [...] picked up their instruments and started playing. Raphael was singing, {{and as soon as he}} touched the bass, it just blew me away." [...] Raphael Wiggins explained how they valued instrumentation when recording the album, saying that [...] "We <b>want</b> <b>everyone</b> to have something to relate to; a drummer will get into the live drums and so on." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{a survey}} {{conducted}} in June 2013 by the All-Russian Center for the Study of Public Opinion (also known as VTsIOM), at least 90 percent of Russians surveyed were in favour of the law. Over 100 conservative groups worldwide signed a petition in support for the law, with Larry Jacobs, manager of the World Congress of Families, supporting its aim to [...] "prohibit advocacy aimed at involving minors in a lifestyle that would imperil their physical and moral health." [...] President of Russia Vladimir Putin answered to early objections to the then-proposed bill in April 2013 by stating that [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>everyone</b> to understand that in Russia there are no infringements on sexual minorities' rights. They're people, just like everyone else, and they enjoy full rights and freedoms". He {{went on to say}} that he fully intended to sign the bill because the Russian people demanded it. As he put it, [...] "Can you imagine an organization promoting pedophilia in Russia? I think people in many Russian regions would have started to take up arms.... The same is true for sexual minorities: I can hardly imagine same-sex marriages being allowed in Chechnya. Can you imagine it? It would have resulted in human casualties." [...] Putin also mentioned that he was concerned about Russia's low birth rate, as same-sex relationships do not produce children. In August 2013, Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko also defended the law, equating it to protecting children from content that glorifies alcohol abuse or drug addiction. He also argued that the controversy over the law and its effects was [...] "invented" [...] by the Western media.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the renewal}} of the fifth season, Abrams stated some {{skepticism}} for a renewal opportunity, but hoped {{that if it was}} cancelled, that it may be picked up by another network. On the other hand, Abrams considered that if Fox did pick up the show for a fifth season, [...] "the next year would be the great ending for the show". Similarly, Fox's Reilly remained cautious about a renewal, noting that while the show {{is one of the top}} shows in the Friday night slot, [...] "it's an expensive show. We lose a lot of money on the show." [...] Reilly further reiterated the dedication of the fans of the show for helping it to its fourth season and continued success. When asked about whether the writers would have enough notice to write the fourth-season finale as a series finale if necessary, Reilly stated, [...] "That's a Peter Roth issue" [...] (chief executive of Warner Bros. Television). To which Roth responded, [...] "We have no plans to give viewers closure this season because we expect the series to continue". In late January 2012, Fox and Warner Bros. Television were working on negotiating a lower licensing cost for the show to allow a fifth season to occur; this would not only help Fox reduce its losses on the show, but would also bring the total number of episodes above 100, giving Warner Bros. a better opportunity to syndicate reruns of the show. Before the announcement of the fifth season, Wyman and Pinkner stated that they would have created a series finale for the end of the fourth season should the show be cancelled; Wyman stated [...] "We want to take care of the fans. We want them to see where it would have gone, but we also know the show has been a commitment and we <b>want</b> <b>everyone</b> to be satisfied with it." ...|$|E

Ponor said, [...] "I will say it again, and I <b>want</b> <b>everyone</b> to know, I will quit without regrets.

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the '68 Special project, a nervous Presley had said to the executive producer Bob Finkel: [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>everyone</b> to know what I can really do." [...] Critics generally agree that had happened – in addition to making profitable, but generally uninspired movies and soundtracks. The '68 Special is widely credited with revitalizing his career: chart statistics for the summer of 1968 suggest that Presley's recording career was becoming all but non-existent and irrelevant. After the special, he began his stint in Las Vegas and toured, achieving a string of record-breaking sell-out performances across America. Chart successes returned, including a U.S. number one in 1969 ("Suspicious Minds") and a U.K. number one ("The Wonder of You", (1970)) – his first since 1965.|$|E
2500|$|Haye's cameo at heavyweight in April 2007 {{resulted}} in an impressive first-round KO win over Polish fighter Tomasz Bonin, {{who at the time}} was ranked No. 9 by the WBC and had only one loss, against Audley Harrison. Haye admitted he was taking [...] "a crazy step up" [...] when he fought world-ranked heavyweight Bonin at Wembley Arena. Haye said in a post fight interview [...] "If you asked me when I was three years old, I'd say I'm going to be the heavyweight champion of world. I never said cruiserweight. It's what I wanted to do since I can remember. I always wanted to be the main man in boxing. I <b>want</b> <b>everyone</b> to recognise I can beat every other boxer in the world.

2500|$|On June 15, 2007, {{following}} {{the defeat of}} the initiative to amend the state constitution, Kris Mineau of the Massachusetts Family Institute warned that gay and lesbian activists would try to repeal the 1913 law next so that [...] "This radical social experiment will be exported to the other 49 states". He said its repeal would [...] "open the floodgates for Massachusetts to become the Mecca for same-sex marriage. Their goal is to strike down the marriage restrictions in every state. Their launching pad will be Massachusetts." [...] Isaacson said [...] "no one is rushing" [...] to take on that issue and that [...] "In the short term, we <b>want</b> <b>everyone</b> to rest, breathe and appreciate the incredible victory that took place". Liberal columnist Ellen Goodman wrote: [...] "Las Vegas? Mecca? So far, little Rhode Island is the only state that allows gay residents to wed in Massachusetts. We are the Las Vegas of Rhode Island." ...|$|E
2500|$|Giorgi Arveladze, the General Director of Imedi TV, {{stated that}} the purpose of the program was to {{demonstrate}} to Georgians the external threats that they were faced with, saying, [...] "The really unpleasant thing about yesterday's report— and I <b>want</b> <b>everyone</b> to understand this well— is that this report is as close to reality as possible, to what may really happen, and to what Georgia's enemies keep in mind". Arveladze apologised for the panic which the broadcast caused in Georgia, but defended the report, and dismissed calls for him to resign. Whilst Arveladze refused to be drawn into questions on whether the broadcast breached the code of conduct for broadcasters, the Georgian National Communications Commission and the Young Lawyers' Association of Georgia said that Imedi had violated the code with its broadcast. The Imedi chief was also forced to defend against allegations that top officials in the Georgian government, including Saakashvili, were informed about the programme before it went to air. After a finding by the GNMC that the broadcast violated the broadcaster's code of conduct, the broadcaster was directed to make a public apology.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} the show was not {{revealed}} in the Indian media until the show officially went on air on 6 May 2012. There were also no get-togethers, parties or press conferences organized to discuss the content, {{leading up to the}} premiere of the show. However, various sources reported the show to be based on [...] "the common man" [...] rather than being fictional. Also, based on its content, it was mostly referred as a talk show discussing social issues like child labour, health problems and other issues affecting the country. Khan, who is known for keeping secrecy for his movies, was quoted saying, [...] "I don`t want to talk much about how the show will be, and about its format. I <b>want</b> <b>everyone</b> to see it directly on TV." [...] However, commenting on the theme of the show, he said, [...] "The show is about meeting the common man of India, connecting with India and its people." [...] He also added, [...] "Through this show we understand the problem of the people, we are not here to make a change. I am no one to change anything. I don`t think I am in the position to change anything else. I feel understanding a problem and feeling it or holding one's hand or hugging is also important. I may not have the solution, but at least I can hear and understand." ...|$|E

2500|$|Also in April, Michael Keaton entered {{talks to}} play a villain, but dropped out of discussions shortly {{thereafter}} due to scheduling conflicts with The Founder. He soon reentered talks for the role after a change in schedule for that film, and closed the deal in late May. In June, Michael Barbieri was cast {{as a friend of}} Parker's, Kenneth Choi was cast as Parker's high school principal, and Logan Marshall-Green was cast as another villain alongside Keaton's character, while Donald Glover and Martin Starr joined the cast in undisclosed roles. Watts said that he wanted the cast to reflect Queens as [...] "one of [...] most diverse places in the world", with Feige adding that [...] "we <b>want</b> <b>everyone</b> to recognize themselves in every portion of our universe. [...] especially, it really feels like this is absolutely what has to happen and continue." [...] This is also different from the previous films, which Feige described as being [...] "set in a lily-white Queens". Additionally, Marvel made a conscious decision to mostly avoid including or referencing characters who appeared in previous Spider-Man films, outside of major ones like Peter and May Parker, and Flash Thompson. This included The Daily Bugle, with co-producer Eric Hauserman Carroll saying, [...] "We toyed with it for a while, but again, we didn’t want to go down that road right away, and if we do do a Daily Bugle, we want {{to do it in a}} way that feels contemporary." [...] This also included the character Mary Jane Watson, but Zendaya's Michelle was eventually given the initials [...] "MJ" [...] as a nod to that character. Feige said that the point of this is [...] "to have fun with [...] while at the same time having it be different characters that can provide a different dynamic." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jackson {{embarked}} on The Velvet Rope Tour, visiting Europe, North America, Japan, New Zealand, Africa, and Australia. It used an autobiographical theme derived from elements of Broadway theater. She stated, [...] "To me, being onstage is about entertaining. I {{know there are}} people who just walk onstage and give you a show by just doing their music, but I always wanted something extra". She added, [...] "I knew what I <b>wanted</b> <b>everyone</b> to look like, especially for the opening number. I knew what I <b>wanted</b> <b>everyone</b> to wear. I visualized the whole thing".

2500|$|Jackson said, [...] "To me, being onstage {{is about}} entertaining.

[...] Jackson conceptualized the tour in Paris, saying [...] "I knew what I <b>wanted</b> <b>everyone</b> to look like, especially for the opening number. I knew what I <b>wanted</b> <b>everyone</b> to wear. I visualized the whole thing." [...] Jackson desired to create new themes for prior hits to avoid repeating previous performances. The tour's logo is a variation of Akan symbol the Sankofa, meaning [...] "you can't move into the future until you understand your past." [...] Jackson tattooed the symbol onto her wrist and used the image frequently throughout the tour's promotional imagery.|$|R
