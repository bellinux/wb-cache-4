We wanted to find a solution to a plot problem. And <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> Leonard Nimoy’s presence there, even though he [...] was dead. So they came up with the bizarre idea of putting his presence into Anna Torv, which is outrageous. Outrageous, and yet we did it, and {{had a lot of fun}} doing it. Then we had to get him out of it. Because Leonard’s officially retired, so we did the animation to use his voice." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Livin' the Dream" [...] {{was written}} by story editor Niki Schwartz-Wright, marking her second writing credit for the series, after the earlier season episode [...] "Lice". It was {{directed}} by regular Office director Jeffrey Blitz, who last directed season eight's [...] "Gettysburg". The episode was originally scheduled to air in its regular half-hour time slot, but NBC later announced it would be expanded to fill an hour time slot beginning a half hour early, although it still counts as one official episode, similar to the earlier season episode [...] "Moving On". Rogers noted that [...] "we knew the last two episodes would be hour-longs, and The Finale might even end up running longer, but <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> {{a lot of great}} storytelling to do leading up to them, and 'Livin' the Dream' was one that ultimately deserved to be an hour long episode as well!" ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{after the}} splendour of the premiere and the praise of some reviewers, when the Andersons {{departed}} {{on a tour}} of Britain to promote the film it was revealed that public interest was mediocre and box office revenue poor, as Gerry Anderson explains: [...] "When we got off the plane at the first destination we were told that the film was in trouble. Cinemas were apparently half-full. When we got to the next big city we got more news that made us even more depressed – box office figures were inexplicably low wherever we went." [...] Anderson proposes that the presence of Thunderbirds on television damaged the chances of its big-screen transfer, asserting, [...] "The only thing we could think was that at that time the audience was not used to seeing a feature film version of a television show. So people would see Thunderbirds and think, 'We've seen it on television.'" [...] Sylvia Anderson offers a similar explanation: [...] "Although <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> our loyal television fans, they remained just that – firmly seated in front of their television screens and not in the cinema." ...|$|E

2500|$|Generations {{special effects}} tasks were {{split between the}} {{television}} show's various effects vendors and ILM. ILM CG Supervisor John Schlag recalled that {{it was easy to}} recruit staff who wanted to work on Star Trek; working on the film [...] "gave me a chance {{to be a part of}} the whole Trek thing [...] ILM is practically an entire company filled with Trek geeks." [...] Effects supervisor John Knoll recalled that Generations screenwriters filled the initial drafts with exciting—and expensive—effects. Knolls's team then storyboarded the effects sequences, figuring out how to best service the script as cheaply as possible. When even those estimates proved too costly, ILM continued cutting shots. [...] " [...] nothing left to cut, and <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> to cut stuff out," [...] Knoll recalled.|$|E
2500|$|After a group stage {{match against}} Lazio in October 2000, Vieira {{claimed he was}} the target of racial abuse from Siniša Mihajlović, to which UEFA {{subsequently}} launched an investigation into. Mihajlović later admitted he made reference to Vieira's colour, but added that he was provoked. The player was then handed a two-match ban for [...] "unsporting actions". Given Arsenal finished behind Manchester United in the league for a third consecutive season, Vieira was reluctant to commit himself to the club and described the season, up until April 2001, as [...] "average". Despite how mature his performances had become since Petit left, he criticised Arsenal's decision to sell him and Marc Overmars to Barcelona: [...] "Of course it was good business but it was a big disappointment for me. If <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> the same team now and put Overmars and Petit in it, we would be even better and stronger. It's not that I miss Petit – the team needs him." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of Metallica recording, the band's songs were written mainly by {{frontman}} James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, with Hetfield being the lyricist. The duo frequently composed together at Ulrich's house in Berkeley, California. Several song ideas and concepts were conceived by {{other members of the}} band, lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Jason Newsted. For instance, Newsted wrote the main riff of [...] "My Friend of Misery", which was originally intended to be an instrumental, one of which had been included on every previous Metallica album. The songs were written in two months in mid-1990; the ideas for some of them were originated during the Damaged Justice Tour. Metallica was impressed with Bob Rock's production work on Mötley Crüe's Dr. Feelgood (1989) and decided to hire him to work on their album. Initially, the band members were not interested in having Rock producing the album as well, but changed their minds. Ulrich said, [...] "We felt that <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> our best record in us and Bob Rock could help us make it".|$|E

I said to myself that I hadn't done her justice; she hadn't organised her forces, was a little helpless and vague, but there was ease for the weary in her happy nature and her peculiar grace. These last were articles on which, five minutes later, before the house, where <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> a margin, I was moved to challenge Ford Obert.|$|E
