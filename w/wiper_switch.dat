50|$|The base XE (rare) had manual windows. The mid-line GXE had power windows, a power {{retracting}} antenna, {{pass thru}} rear armrest, a digital clock in dash (became optional on 1995 models), and color matched plastic speaker grilles for the rear 6-inch speakers. The XE and GXE models {{only had the}} fixed intermittent <b>wiper</b> <b>switch.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 1979 - Revisions to all models: driver's side rear {{fog light}} and rear seat belts. The R20 TS got a new cooling fan, inertia reel rear seat belts, a new {{windscreen}} <b>wiper</b> <b>switch,</b> and {{the choice of a}} 5-speed gearbox. The R30 TS got a more powerful [...] engine, and small pocket in the drivers sun visor.|$|E
50|$|As {{with the}} exterior, the {{interior}} of the 5G Taurus is largely carried over from the Five Hundred with subtle differences such as darker simulated woodgrain and new steering wheel. Ford relocated the <b>wiper</b> <b>switch</b> from the left hand side (as with the Five Hundred) to the turn signal stalk on the right hand side, as has been the design of every Taurus since its 1986 introduction.|$|E
50|$|One-time {{windshield}} <b>wiper</b> switch: <b>Switch</b> stem at {{your fingertips}} clears the glass with one sweep.|$|R
25|$|Inside, {{headrests}} {{were now}} standard equipment {{and a new}} instrument panel included square instruments replacing the round instruments of previous years along with a push-button operated ashtray and rotary glove compartment knob, as well as heating/air conditioning controls relocated {{from the center of}} the dash to the left of the steering wheel near the lights and <b>wiper</b> <b>switches.</b> The high-beam lights indicator was a red rocket located on the dash. Also new was a steering column-mounted ignition switch that also locked the steering wheel when not in use â€“ a feature found on all 1969-model General Motors passenger cars, a year before locking steering columns were required by federal mandate starting in 1970.|$|R
5000|$|Some larger {{cars are}} {{equipped}} with hidden wipers (or depressed-park wipers). When <b>wipers</b> are <b>switched</b> off in standard non-hidden designs, a [...] "parking" [...] mechanism or circuit moves the wipers to the lower extreme of the wiped area {{near the bottom of}} the windscreen, but still in sight. For designs that hide the wipers, the windscreen extends below the rear edge of the hood, and the wipers park themselves below the wiping range at the bottom of the windscreen, but out of sight.|$|R
50|$|For 1982, the locking {{steering}} column was introduced; the ignition switch, dimmer switch and <b>wiper</b> <b>switch</b> were relocated to the {{steering column}}. After 1982, 3-speed manuals would be relocated {{to the floor}} and base models will no longer have round headlamps, which would make Manual Transmission 1982 G vans rare and collectable as 1982 was the only model year with column shift manual transmission and ignition switch on the steering column. Also, 1982 was the only year with the left rear glass as an option on one side only.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{revisions}} {{were limited}} to creature comforts, such as a locking glovebox lid, a reversed position of the cigarette lighter and windshield <b>wiper</b> <b>switch,</b> and single release handles for front and rear body sections. Other interior improvements included the addition of power windows and optional air conditioning, available for [...] About 338 P400S Miura were produced between December 1968 and March 1971. One S #4407 was owned by Frank Sinatra. Miles Davis also owned one, which he crashed in October 1972 {{under the influence of}} cocaine, breaking both ankles. Eddie Van Halen owns one and can be heard revving it up during the bridge in the song Panama.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the changes already introduced earlier models ZiU 682V0A - and - ZiU 682V0B model ZiU- 682G has received the following differences [...] Front, under the windshield, placed the intake grille [...] Changed the location of windows with vents along the starboard side [...] Undergone significant redevelopment salon trolley [...] Most of the seats along {{the left side of}} the body is replaced with a double row on row, which increased the number of standing places [...] Changed design seat themselves and their handrails [...] Big changes undergone cab [...] Partition behind the driver, which had previously oval window became deaf extended sliding door in the driver's cabin. In the cabin itself changed the layout of the dashboard, which became made of black plastic. Out of the past neergonomichny remote control trolley bus right from the dashboard, consisting of two long rows of identical tumblers [...] Control of external light devices was moved to the steering column [...] On a dedicated right panel were only control door opening, the <b>wiper</b> <b>switch</b> and alarm [...] Other switches transferred to the new control panel by trolley to the left of the driver's side near the window.

50|$|On 22 September 2015, Formlabs {{announced}} the Form 2 printer, including a larger build volume and a <b>wiper.</b> It also <b>switches</b> to a cartridge resin system, instead of bottles {{that needed to}} be manually poured into the Form 1 & Form 1+. Third-party resins can be used with Open Mode.|$|R
5000|$|Power signalling, however, was {{installed}} in two signal boxes, one at {{the north and the}} other at the south of Doncaster station. The work was planned and some equipment was on site before the Second World War but the installation was not commissioned until 1949. Searchlight colour light signals and electric point machines were controlled from switch panels. The interlocking equipment was unique being a sequence switch interlocking system manufactured by Standard Telephone Company using telephone switching techniques to the technical specification of the signal engineer of the then Southern Area of the London and North Eastern Railway. The sequence switches consisted of a rotary contact shaft which was rotated to a route position and proved a circuit through contact <b>wipers.</b> Each <b>switch</b> had a [...] "home" [...] position and eleven route positions. When a route was initiated, a clutch was engaged on the appropriate switch to rotate it into its correct position thus setting up the appropriate interlocking circuits through other switches and relays. The installations proved to be remarkably reliable, serving a very useful purpose but were eventually life expired.|$|R

This article develops an integrated methodology for quality & reliability improve-ment when degradation data are available as the response in the experiments. The noise factors affecting the product are classified into two groups which led to a Brownian motion model for the degradation characteristic. A simple optimization procedure for finding the best control factor setting is developed using an integrated loss function. The methodology is illustrated with an application to a window <b>wiper</b> <b>switch</b> experiment...|$|E
30|$|The {{products}} {{listed by}} companies are chosen from standard categories {{provided by the}} database and hence are consistent. A product refers {{to one of the}} product categories in the network, which are generic automobile components and sub-systems, rather than model specific. These could include categories such as gearbox, air conditioner, <b>wiper</b> <b>switch.</b> Product categories are thus viewed as substitutable. Generic processing capabilities such as forging and plastic moulding were ignored. Our view is that suppliers that create these generic product categories could be substitutable as they have the general capability and tools to produce a given product.|$|E

This article develops an integrated methodology for quality and reliability improvement when degrada-tion data are available as the response in the experiments. A new classification of the noise factors is introduced to capture the special structure for the variance of the degradation char-acteristic. Based on it, a systematic development of the Brownian motion model is described. A simple optimization procedure for finding the best control factor setting is developed using an integrated loss function.

40|$|In 1991 Zlotin and Zusman {{proposed}} to systematically search for possible scenarios by utilizing an inversion approach. Instead {{of searching for}} the reasons of a failure, they suggested to generate system failures. This approach has since been further developed and successfully utilized by industry. This paper presents two practical application of the &# 039;inverted&# 039; systematized Substance-Field Analysis for failure analysis. The first case study is devoted to application of Substance-Field Analysis in establishing the reasons for a <b>wiper</b> <b>switch</b> failure.
