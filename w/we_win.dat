500|$|Supported by {{troops from}} the rulers of Sogdia, Shash and Ferghana, the Turgesh {{attacked}} the Umayyad army within the pass, two days after they had left Kish (a Friday), {{at a distance of}} six farsakhs—ca. —from Samarkand. The Turgesh attacked while the Arab army had stopped to take a meal. The Arab vanguard, under Uthman ibn 'Abdallah ibn al-Shikhkhir, was overwhelmed, but Junayd was able to hurriedly deploy the main body of his army, placing his troops according to their tribal affiliations, with the Tamim and Azd on the right, and the Rabi'ah on the left. The Arabs hurriedly erected earthworks in front of their lines, and the initial Turgesh attack, directed against the Arab right, was pushed back. Junayd, who had placed himself in the centre to direct the battle, then joined the ranks of the Azd, who greeted him with hostility: their standard-bearer is reported to have told him [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>win,</b> it will be for your benefit; if we perish, you will not weep over us. By my life, if <b>we</b> <b>win</b> and I survive, I will never speak a word to you." [...] Al-Tabari reports that this man and seventeen successive bearers of the same standard were killed during the battle, indicative of the fierceness of the fight. The Arabs initially met the Turgesh attack on horseback, but as their casualties mounted, Junayd's herald ordered them to dismount and fight on foot, crouching down behind the trenches and forming a spear-wall. This measure helped the Muslims hold their ground, and eventually both sides wearied and the battle ceased for the day. The most grievous casualties among the Arabs were suffered by the stragglers and baggage, who gathered under Abdallah ibn Mu'ammar ibn Sumayr al-Yashkuri near Kish: they were attacked by the Turgesh and virtually annihilated.|$|E
500|$|In January 1977, {{four years}} prior to {{becoming}} president, Ronald Reagan bluntly stated, {{in a conversation with}} Richard V. Allen, his basic expectation in relation to the Cold War. [...] "My idea of American policy toward the Soviet Union is simple, and some would say simplistic," [...] he said. [...] "It is this: <b>We</b> <b>win</b> and they lose. What do you think of that?" [...] In 1980, Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, vowing to increase military spending and confront the Soviets everywhere. Both Reagan and new British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher denounced the Soviet Union and its ideology. Reagan labeled the Soviet Union an [...] "evil empire" [...] and predicted that Communism would be left on the [...] "ash heap of history," [...] while Thatcher inculpated the Soviets as [...] "bent on world dominance." ...|$|E
500|$|Chelsea midfielder Joe Cole was keen to win {{his first}} trophy in the final: [...] "We don't feel under any great pressure, but we do feel excited about the {{possibility}} of winning our first trophy, we've just been imagining {{what it would be like}} to lift the trophy, who's going where in the line if <b>we</b> <b>win</b> it, and how we'll run round Cardiff with it." [...] Teammate Frank Lampard was also keen {{to win his}} first trophy: [...] "If you haven't won anything, a runners-up medal is not what you want at all." [...] He also stated that Chelsea manager José Mourinho's desire to win had been rubbing off on the players: [...] "He actually gets angrier with each one, so every time we lose it's the worst I've seen him, he's a winner, though, that's what you expect, and that's the attitude that's needed at Chelsea these days." ...|$|E

Slavko Kvaternik declared {{the establishment of the}} Independent State of Croatia (Nezavisna Država Hrvatska, NDH) via the Zagreb Radio Station, with Zagreb as its capital. Most of the population was pleased with the dissolution of Yugoslavia. Kvaternik formed a provisional government in Zagreb on 12 April. Ante Pavelić, who was named the leader (Poglavnik) of NDH, arrived in Zagreb on 15 April. He gave a short speech in which he said: [...] "Ustaše! <b>We</b> have <b>won.</b> <b>We</b> <b>won</b> because <b>we</b> had faith. <b>We</b> <b>won</b> because <b>we</b> held out. <b>We</b> <b>won</b> because <b>we</b> fought.

[...] While Colbert accepted his apology, Stewart continued and asked why Colbert had initially responded by shoving a recycling bin over Stewart's head and hitting him with a baseball bat. [...] To which Colbert replied, [...] "No, no, Jon—I shoved a recycling bin over your head and encouraged Conan to hit you with a baseball bat," [...] and, as usual, left Stewart confused.

500|$|On March 15 2015, Stig Inge Bjørnebye {{succeded}} Erik Hoftun as {{the sports}} director of Eliteserien club, Rosenborg Ballklub.

Rosenborg Ballklub is the first club in the history of Norwegian football to do so {{two years in a}} row. As the sports director of Rosenborg Ballklub he has many responsibilities, among many others signing on new players and renewing contracts with existing players. The most notable signing came on March 6 2017: Nicklas Bendtner signed on for a 3-year contract with the Norwegian side. Making it the most surprising and most notable signing in the history of Norwegian football. Teammate and Eliteserien superstar, Pål André Helland, {{had this to say about}} the signing: [...] "It shouldn't come as a surprise if he becomes the top scorer and <b>we</b> <b>win</b> the league." ...|$|E
500|$|Chelsea manager José Mourinho {{used his}} pre-match {{interview}} {{to state that}} his previous wins in the tournament had changed the way that clubs approach the League Cup: [...] "Lots of teams have followed us since then when we took the League Cup as a real competition, as a real challenge. It is a big competition." [...] He separated the final from the league season, saying, [...] "I don't think if <b>we</b> <b>win</b> the cup final we will win the league, or if we lose it we will lose the league." [...] He refused to discuss the suspension of Matić, dismissing it with [...] "If I speak to you about that, I promise you I will be in big trouble". Despite opining that the two teams and the match officials would act fairly, he criticised players who dive, despite not naming any names. Mourinho also claimed that in after leaving Chelsea {{for the first time}} in September 2007, he was approached to manage Tottenham by chairman Daniel Levy, and again in 2012.|$|E

500|$|Both {{teams had}} injury {{concerns}} {{ahead of the}} final. Liverpool {{were expected to be}} without midfielders Charlie Adam and Lucas Leiva, who were both out with knee injuries, while Chelsea were missing defenders David Luiz and Gary Cahill to hamstring injuries. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was determined to claim a domestic double with victory in the final: [...] "The FA Cup is special, but we got a taste of success from winning the Carling Cup. That will help the younger players in the squad. Winning breeds confidence and you want more." [...] Gerrard believed success in the final would compensate for a poor season in the Premier League: [...] "We are all aware we have underachieved in the league and the squad of players is certainly better than where we are. We will assess the season and if <b>we</b> <b>win</b> two trophies I think it would alleviate the pressure slightly." [...] Chelsea captain John Terry was hopeful Chelsea would win the final, to help caretaker manager Roberto Di Matteo's hopes of getting the job full-time: [...] "To win it [...] will put himself in a very good position. He's not thinking of that at the moment, he's not letting the players get distracted by anything. He's very passionate, he's Chelsea through and through, and that's certainly rubbed off on the players. So, if we can do it with the added bonus that Robbie can get the job at the end, that'd be great." ...|$|E

2500|$|Antonescu was a {{firm believer}} in the {{conspiracy}} theory of [...] "Jewish Bolshevism", according to which all Jews were supporters of communism and the Soviet Union. His arguments on the matter involved a spurious claim that, during the 1940 retreat from Bessarabia, the Jews had organized themselves and attacked Romanian soldiers. In part, this notion exaggerated unilateral reports of enthusiasm among the marginalized Jews upon the arrival of Red Army troops. In a summer 1941 address to his ministers, Antonescu stated: [...] "The Satan is the Jew. [...] is a battle of life and death. Either <b>we</b> <b>win</b> and the world will be purified, either they win and we will become their slaves." [...] At around the same time, he envisaged the ethnic cleansing ("cleaning out") of Jews from the eastern Romanian-held territories. However, as early as February 1941, Antonescu was also contemplating the ghettoization of all Jewish Romanians, as an early step toward their expulsion. In this context, Antonescu frequently depicted Jews as a disease or a poison. After the Battle of Stalingrad, he encouraged the army commanders to resist the counteroffensive, as otherwise the Soviets [...] "will bring Bolshevism to the country, wipe out the entire leadership stratum, impose the Jews on us, and deport masses of our people." ...|$|E

He stated in the media that requiring black people to swear allegiance to the Canadian sovereign to receive citizenship was akin to forcing Jews {{to swear an oath}} to a descendant of Adolf Hitler and said {{in a letter to his}} fellow litigants: [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>win</b> this class action, a centuries-old tradition would begin to unravel." [...] Though the federal Crown made two attempts to have the case dismissed as frivolous and vexatious, on 20 February 2008, the Ontario Court of Appeal approved the proceeding of the case to the Ontario Superior Court. During the proceedings, the Monarchist League of Canada publicly supported the present oath and opposed Roach's actions and media reaction was also negative, with a number of op-ed pieces denouncing Roach's challenges. Roach's case was dismissed by the Ontario Superior Court in January 2009.|$|E
