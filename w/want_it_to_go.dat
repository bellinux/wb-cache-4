Reznor told the newspaper [...] "at this point, I want to switch things around a bit. [...] Nine Inch Nails as a rock band configuration, we've done it and we've done it again. [...] I see other ways I can present the material in concert, more challenging, something new. [...] I don't <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> stale". [...] In the same article, Reznor also admitted that [...] "the idea of five guys playing loud music [...] two hours ... has got to change once finances come into play, especially performing in markets outside of the mainland U.S. I want to whittle things down".|$|E
500|$|Much of Dignity {{was written}} in Duff's own home, as she felt [...] "comfortable and free" [...] there. She said that she knew from the {{beginning}} that she wanted to write the album with the assistance of songwriter and producer Kara DioGuardi, due to their previous work history on songs such as [...] "Come Clean" [...] and [...] "Fly". Another reason that Duff wished to work with her was that she found her lyrics were complemented by DioGuardi's melodies. She added, [...] "I helped with the melodies, but that's not my strongest suit. Coming up with the lyrics was mainly [...] I'd tell her this is how I <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> and she would help with the lyrics, too, sometimes. She'd say, 'This doesn't really fit,' and if I was adamant, we'd make it work." ...|$|E
500|$|McCartney asked Klein to {{dissolve}} the Beatles' partnership, but was refused. Exasperated, he took {{the case to the}} High Court in London in early 1971, naming Klein and the other Beatles as defendants. Among the six reasons McCartney gave for dissolving the Beatles was that Klein's company, ABKCO, had caused [...] "intolerable interference" [...] by overdubbing [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] without consulting McCartney. In his written affidavit, Starr countered this statement by saying that when Spector had sent acetates of Let It Be to each of the Beatles for their approval, with a request also for feedback: [...] "We all said yes. Even at the beginning Paul said yes. I spoke to him on the phone, and said, 'Did you like it?' and he said, 'Yeah, it's OK.' He didn't put it down." [...] Starr added: [...] "And then suddenly he didn't <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out. Two weeks after that, he wanted to cancel it." ...|$|E

50|$|Kare Kano was Masami Tsuda's first lengthy manga series.

50|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} intended for Theda Bara. However Bara {{chose not to}} renew her contract and, after making the ill-fated Kathleen Mavourneen, all but retired from film. While making Mavourneen, construction began on sets for The Queen of Sheba. Not <b>wanting</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> waste, William Fox chose to put Betty Blythe in the role. The film became a hit but Blythe never matched its success with her later films.|$|R

In 1970, Ali had stated: [...] "Me and Joe Frazier will be buddies.

2500|$|On January 10, 2007, Bush {{announced}} {{the commitment of}} more than 20,000 additional troops {{as a part of}} the Iraqi troop surge of 2007. McCain was a leading advocate for the move, leading some Democrats to call the policy the [...] "McCain Doctrine". Days after the announcement, McCain appeared on CBS' Face the Nation and said, [...] "This is a chance under the new leadership of General Petraeus and Admiral Fallon to have a chance to succeed. Do I believe it can succeed? Yes, I do." [...] On February 4, he criticised a bipartisan non-binding resolution opposing the troop buildup, calling it a [...] "vote of no confidence" [...] in the US military. The next day, McCain said, [...] "I don't think it's appropriate to say that you disapprove of a mission and you don't want to fund it and you don't <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> but yet you don't take the action necessary to prevent it".|$|E
5000|$|Chandler's [...] "inevitability thesis" [...] is the {{philosophy}} of technology proposition, stated in Technological or Media Determinism (1995), that once a technology is introduced into a culture, what follows is the inevitable development of that technology.

50|$|When Bo Callaway {{was elected}} to the U.S. House of Representatives in November 1964, Carter {{immediately}} began planning to unseat him. The two had previously clashed over which two-year college would be expanded to a four-year college program by the state; Carter <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Georgia Southwestern College in Americus, but Callaway wanted the funding <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> downtown Columbus. Carter saw Callaway, a Republican, as a rival who represented the inherited wealth and selfishness he despised in politics.|$|R

2500|$|Vanessa {{was created}} in 2009 by Holby City {{executive}} producer Tony McHale, {{as a replacement for}} former CEO Jayne Grayson (Stella Gonet), who departed from the show during its eleventh series. It was first announced on 18 May 2009 that actress Leslie Ash had been cast in the role, after a five-year break from acting due to complications arising from MSSA. Ash commented that the role was the first she had had to audition for since the age of nineteen, and although nervous: [...] "I am so pleased and happy they've given me this chance. They are very brave to have taken on a disabled actress. I can't wait to be back on set. It's the last piece of the jigsaw in my recovery. I'm finally back to where I was." [...] McHale commented: [...] "We're thrilled to have Leslie join us at Holby. We know she's going to be a terrific asset to the show and her character will bring another dimension to our already strong cast. Her stories are going to have our viewers guessing all the way." [...] Her first scenes were filmed in June 2009, for broadcast in October 2009. Asked how long she saw herself staying in Holby City, Ash replied: [...] "At the moment I’m really happy, so as long as they want me! I <b>want</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> well so I can stay on. Also, I know there are lots of women out there who love this show and I don’t want them to be disappointed.

6000|$|For {{a moment}} Rilla {{was tempted to}} say [...] "Yes." [...] The baby could be sent to Hopetown--it would be decently looked after--she could have her free days and {{untrammelled}} nights back again. But--but--that poor young mother who hadn't <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the asylum! Rilla couldn't get that out of her thoughts.

"The {{only thing}} to dislike about THE BURNING LAND is that it didn’t go in the {{direction}} that the main character (and at least {{this part of the}} readership) <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> But that means that the issue of who holds Bebbanburg Castle will be resolved in another volume, and given Cornwell’s talents, that will be a book to wait for indeed." ...|$|R

50|$|During the war, the {{government}} {{became much more}} involved in people's lives via governmental organisation of the rationing of foodstuffs, clothing and fuel and extra milk and meals being given to expectant mothers and children.
