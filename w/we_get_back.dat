500|$|The tone of {{baseball}} rivalries {{changed in the}} early 1990s; fraternization between players who had moved to different teams or knew each other from various ventures kept baseball rivalries to a [...] "friendly" [...] level. However, Major League Baseball's 1994 divisional re-alignment solidified the rivalry between the Phillies and Mets. The Pittsburgh Pirates, {{former members of the}} National League East and in-state rivals of the Phillies, moved into the newly created National League Central Division, and the Atlanta Braves, former members of the National League West, entered the division. Prior to the switch, the East Division contained seven teams, spread out over a wider geographical area, including the St. Louis Cardinals and the Chicago Cubs, as well as the expansion Florida Marlins. Members of all 28 teams, including the Phillies and Mets, drew together during the 1994 labor stoppage, but players from both teams were {{on opposite sides of the}} argument even then. Dykstra claimed that he was losing $30,000 ($ in current dollars) per day for every day he did not work during the strike.
