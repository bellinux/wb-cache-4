5|$|Not {{only did}} Sorabji, {{who had not}} written any music since 1968, return to {{composition}} {{as a result of}} Hinton's interest in his work, but on 24 March 1976 he gave the pianist Yonty Solomon permission to play his works in public (although it has been claimed that Michael Habermann received tentative approval at an earlier date). Several recitals ensued and led to the making of a television documentary on Sorabji, which was broadcast in 1977. The images in it consisted mostly of still photographs of his house; there was just one brief shot of Sorabji <b>waving</b> <b>to</b> the departing camera crew.|$|E
5|$|If {{one game}} is played as a sequel to the other by a linked password, Twinrova captures Princess Zelda, {{lighting}} the Flame of Despair. Link enters a warp point by the Maku Tree and faces Twinrova, who is attempting to use the three Flames to revive Ganon, the primary antagonist in the Zelda series. Link defeats both Twinrova and a mindless, poorly resurrected Ganon. He frees Zelda, whose sacrifice {{would have been the}} full resurrection of Ganon; together, they exit the crumbling castle. After the credits, Link is seen <b>waving</b> <b>to</b> a crowd from a sailboat off the shore of a land with a castle in the background.|$|E
5|$|The {{unblemished}} musculature of {{the central}} figure <b>waving</b> <b>to</b> the rescue ship {{is reminiscent of the}} Neoclassical, however the naturalism of light and shadow, the authenticity of the desperation shown by the survivors and the emotional character of the composition differentiate it from Neoclassical austerity. It was a further departure from the religious or classical themes of earlier works because it depicted contemporary events with ordinary and unheroic figures. Both the choice of subject matter and the heightened manner in which the dramatic moment is depicted are typical of Romantic painting—strong indications {{of the extent to which}} Géricault had moved from the prevalent Neoclassical movement.|$|E
50|$|On {{the left}} hand of the box the FreqBox {{contains}} a VCO which has two knobs to control frequency and waveshape. The waveshape runs from triangle <b>wave</b> <b>to</b> sawtooth <b>wave</b> <b>to</b> square <b>wave</b> <b>to</b> pulse <b>wave.</b> There is a hard sync on/off switch that turns on hard syncing the VCO signal with the input signals frequency.

25|$|According to the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee on Assassinations, Kennedy was <b>waving</b> <b>to</b> {{the crowds}} {{on his right}} with his right arm upraised {{on the side of}} the limo when a shot entered his upper back, {{penetrated}} his neck and slightly damaged a spinal vertebra and the top of his right lung. The bullet exited his throat nearly centerline just beneath his larynx and nicked the left side of his suit tie knot. He raised his elbows and clenched his fists in front of his face and neck, then leaned forward and left. Mrs. Kennedy, facing him, then put her arms around him in concern.|$|E
25|$|Banda was {{the subject}} of an {{extensive}} cult of personality. Every business building was required to have an official picture of him hanging on the wall, and no poster, clock or picture could be higher than his portrait. Before every film, a video of Banda <b>waving</b> <b>to</b> the people was shown while the anthem played. When Banda visited a city, a contingent of women were expected to greet him at the airport and dance for him. A special cloth, bearing the president's picture, was the required attire for these performances. Houses of worship required government approval to operate, and some faiths such as Jehovah's Witnesses were banned entirely.|$|E
25|$|The Williams team's {{decision}} {{to develop their}} new semi-automatic gearbox by racing with it {{at the start of}} the season, was at the cost of points in the opening rounds of the championship. Senna was on 40 points with four straight wins to open the season by the time Mansell gained his first finish with a second in Monaco. Mansell then had the next race in Canada practically won when his Williams FW14 stopped half a lap from the finish with what was reported to be transmission failure, though it was suspected that Mansell had let his engine revs drop too low while he was <b>waving</b> <b>to</b> the crowd in celebration and stalled his engine. Ironically this handed Nelson Piquet his 23rd and last F1 race win. Despite a good mid-season, which included a hat-trick of victories, Senna's consistency (and Mansell's retirements at key races) meant that he finished second in the Championship for the third time in his career, this time behind Senna.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Web-based {{communication}} and collaboration {{is a significant}} trend in modern enterprises. However, communication as well as collaboration still makes use of various platforms like email, instant-messaging, or wikis. Google introduced Google <b>Wave</b> <b>to</b> solve the disadvantages in usage caused by the combination of multiple technologies. The contribution {{of this paper is}} an analysis comparing <b>Wave</b> <b>to</b> other kinds of {{communication and}} collaboration with regard to its application as an enterprise 2. 0 tool. Based on this, an integration prototype is implemented, which reveals the essential effort of interconnecting Google <b>Wave</b> <b>to</b> an Enterprise Content Management System. ...|$|R
25|$|Ellis is imprisoned {{with other}} accused collaborators, and humiliated and {{tortured}} by the violently anti-Nazi volunteer jailers, but is rescued by Akkermans, now a {{colonel in the}} Dutch Army. Akkermans brings her to his medical office, and tells her that he killed Franken when the Nazi tried to escape. He shows her the cash and jewels stolen from Franken's Jewish victims. When informed about Müntze's fate, Ellis goes into shock, and Akkermans administers a tranquilizer which is in fact an overdose of insulin. Ellis, feeling dizzy, sees the bottle of insulin and survives by quickly eating a bar of chocolate. She realizes then that Akkermans was a traitor who had collaborated with Franken and had killed the Smaals. While Akkermans is distracted, <b>waving</b> <b>to</b> a crowd that cheers him, she jumps from his balcony into the crowd below and runs away. He tries to follow her, but is blocked by the very same people cheering him as a hero of the Resistance.|$|E
25|$|One such grand {{residence}} is {{the marble}} and limestone Patterson Mansion at 15Dupont Circle. This Italianate mansion, the only {{survivor of the}} many mansions that once ringed the circle, was built in 1901 by New York architect Stanford White for Robert Patterson, editor of the Chicago Tribune, and his wife Nellie, heiress to the Chicago Tribune fortune. Upon Mrs.Patterson's incapacitation in the early 1920s, the house passed {{into the hands of}} her daughter, Cissy Patterson, who made it a hub of Washington social life. The house served as temporary quarters for President and Mrs.Calvin Coolidge in 1927 while the White House underwent renovation. The Coolidges welcomed Charles Lindbergh as a houseguest after his historic transatlantic flight. Lindbergh made several public appearances at the house, <b>waving</b> <b>to</b> roaring crowds from the second-story balcony, and befriended the Patterson Family, with whom he increasingly came to share isolationist and pro-German views. Cissy Patterson later acquired the Washington Times-Herald (sold to Washington Post in 1954) and declared journalistic warfare on Franklin D. Roosevelt from 15Dupont Circle, continuing throughout World WarII to push her policies, which were echoed in the New York Daily News, run by her brother Joseph Medill Patterson, and the Chicago Tribune, run by their first cousin, Colonel Robert R. McCormick.|$|E
500|$|Years later, Lorelei {{remembered that}} she had been <b>waving</b> <b>to</b> the crowd when she was grabbed by two of the bodyguards who had {{accompanied}} the Jeep and placed her back in the vehicle. [...] The party was unable to return to home plate because of the rowdy fans, so the Jeep was driven out of the stadium and through the surrounding streets, to the delight of the many Cohos outside the stadium who recognized the occupants. [...] They were driven {{to the front of the}} stadium, ushered back inside, and taken up to the press room where they had spent most of the first game.|$|E

500|$|The video draws {{influence}} from 1950s and 1960s variety shows, and features Carey wearing a short, red [...] "sexy Santa" [...] ensemble, whilst {{on stage with}} a band, which featured gospel back-in singers {{as well as a}} group of dancers, consisting of cheerleaders. The plotline is centered on Carey hosting a [...] "Mariah Carey Christmas" [...] television show. The announcer introduces Carey saying [...] "here she is, the greatest singer of all time, Ms. Mariah Carey!". The video then shows Carey's backup singers belting out the chorus while the singer is seen performing in front of a cheering audience. Her collection of fragrances is also advertised in the opening. In {{the second half of the}} video, Santa Claus makes an appearance, <b>waving</b> <b>to</b> friends and sharing a hug with Carey.

500|$|In April 2001, Carey {{signed a}} US$100 million record deal with Virgin Records (EMI Records). Following {{commencement}} for Glitter — her first album {{under the new}} label — and the film of same name, Carey embarked on a short promotional campaign for the project. On July 19, 2001, Carey made a surprise appearance on the MTV program Total Request Live (TRL). She came out onto the filming stage, pushing an ice cream cart while wearing an oversized shirt. Seemingly anxious and exhilarated, Carey began giving out individual bars of ice cream to fans and guests on the program, while <b>waving</b> <b>to</b> the crowd down below on Times Square, while diverging into a rambling monologue regarding therapy. Carey then walked to Daly's platform and began a striptease, in which she shed her shirt to reveal a tight yellow and green ensemble, leading him to exclaim [...] "Mariah Carey has lost her mind!".|$|E
500|$|On March 30, Reagan {{delivered}} a luncheon address to AFL–CIO representatives at the Washington Hilton Hotel. The hotel {{was considered the}} safest venue in Washington because of its secure, enclosed passageway called [...] "President's Walk", which was built after the 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy. Reagan entered the building through the passageway around 1:45p.m., <b>waving</b> <b>to</b> a crowd of news media and citizens. The Secret Service had required him to wear a bulletproof vest for some events, but Reagan was not wearing one for the speech, because his only public exposure would be the 30 feet (9 m) between the hotel and his limousine, and the agency did not require vests for its agents that day. No one saw Hinckley behaving in an unusual way; witnesses who reported him as [...] "fidgety" [...] and [...] "agitated" [...] apparently confused Hinckley with another person that the Secret Service had been monitoring.|$|E
