5|$|The {{carriage}} barn complex predates the Shepards' {{ownership of}} the property; it was built around 1875 as part of Wright's original estate. The most prominent component is the brick carriage house, which was designed by McKim, Mead & White. It is made of brick with granite trim and is {{one and a half}} stories high, ten bays wide and three bays deep. It has a steeply pitched slate hip roof <b>with</b> <b>spring</b> eaves and exposed rafters. At the roof's ridge sits an octagonal ventilating element with a bell-cast roof.|$|E

5|$|The early Archaic {{people living}} near Mesa Verde {{utilized}} the atlatl and harvested {{a wider variety}} of plants and animals than the Paleo-Indians had, while retaining their primarily nomadic lifestyle. They inhabited the outlying areas of the Mesa Verde region, but also the mountains, mesa tops, and canyons, where they created rockshelters and rock art, and left evidence of animal processing and chert knapping. Environmental stability during the period drove population expansion and migration. Major warming and drying from 5000 to 2500 might have led middle Archaic people to seek the cooler climate of Mesa Verde, whose higher elevation brought increased snowpack that, when coupled <b>with</b> <b>spring</b> rains, provided relatively plentiful amounts of water.|$|E
5|$|The western {{terminus}} of M-104 is at US31 in Ferrysburg at {{the north}} end of the drawbridge spanning the Grand River north of Grand Haven. The highway runs along Savidge Street and crosses a bridge over the channel that connect the river <b>with</b> <b>Spring</b> Lake. On the opposite shore, the trunkline continues along Savidge Street, running between the river to its south and the lake to its north. M-104 crosses the central business area of the village of Spring Lake. East of downtown, the highway transitions to follow Cleveland Street which continues due east to Nunica. The landscape becomes more rural east of Spring Lake where the highway crosses terrain with a mix of open fields and woods. There are various businesses and homes that line the roadway. The eastern terminus of M-104 is located at the exit9 interchange along I-96 just west of Nunica.|$|E

Tremo often consulted royal menus with the court physician and occasionally prepared separate dishes specifically for the king to accommodate his sensitive stomach.

5|$|When growing {{conditions}} improve, {{such as the}} arrival of warmer weather and the longer days associated <b>with</b> <b>spring</b> in temperate regions, growth starts again. The expanding shoot pushes its way out, shedding the scales in the process. These leave behind scars {{on the surface of}} the twig. The whole year's growth may take place in just a few weeks. The new stem is unlignified at first and may be green and downy. The Arecaceae (palms) have their leaves spirally arranged on an unbranched trunk. In some tree species in temperate climates, a second spurt of growth, a Lammas growth may occur which is believed to be a strategy to compensate for loss of early foliage to insect predators.|$|E

25|$|Breeding {{can be at}} {{any time}} of year {{depending}} on conditions, <b>with</b> <b>spring</b> being favoured. Pregnancy usually takes 38–41 days but can be extended significantly if the mother is still suckling the previous brood. Litters of 3 or 4 are typical, 6 being the maximum. The young remain in the nest while the female forages; if they wander both male and female adults retrieve them. They reach sexual maturity in {{about two and a half}} months. After mating, a copulatory plug is formed in the female's reproductive tract.|$|E
