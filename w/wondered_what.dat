5|$|By 1990, Moffat {{had written}} two series of Press Gang, but the programme's high cost along with {{organisational}} changes at Central cast its future in doubt. As Moffat <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> {{to do next}} and worried about his future employment, Bob Spiers, Press Gangs primary director, suggested that he meet with producer Andre Ptaszynski to discuss writing a sitcom. Moffat's {{father had been a}} headteacher and Moffat himself had taught English before writing Press Gang, so his initial proposal was a programme similar to what would become Chalk, a series that eventually aired in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{economic}} realities of the conversion to sound, were the artistic considerations. Early sound films were often noted for being too verbose. In 1930, Carl Laemmle criticized the wall-to-wall banter of sound pictures, and director Ernst Lubitsch <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> the camera was intended for if characters were going to narrate all the onscreen action. The film industry also withstood competition from the home radio, and often characters in films {{went to great lengths}} to belittle the medium. The film industry was not above using the new medium to broadcast commercials for its projects however, and occasionally turned radio stars into short feature performers to take advantage of their built-in following.|$|E
5|$|Beauregard's {{decision}} {{was one of}} the most controversial of the Civil War. Numerous veterans and historians have <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> might have happened if the assault had gone forward into the night. Beauregard believed that the battle was essentially won and his men could finish off Grant in the morning. He knew the terrain to be crossed (a steep ravine containing a creek named Dill Branch) was extremely difficult and Grant's defensive line was heavy with massed artillery and supported by gunboats in the river. Unbeknownst to Beauregard, Buell's Army of the Ohio began arriving that afternoon, and he and Grant launched a massive counterattack on April 7. Overwhelmed, the Confederates retreated to Corinth.|$|E

5|$|Some critics, {{among them}} Tchaikovsky biographers Lawrence and Elisabeth Hanson, have <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> would have {{happened}} if Tchaikovsky had joined Balakirev in 1862 instead of attending the Conservatory. They suggest that he might have developed much more quickly as an independent composer, and offer as proof the fact that Tchaikovsky did not write his first wholly distinct work until Balakirev goaded and inspired him to write Romeo. How well Tchaikovsky might have developed in the long run is another matter. He owed much of his musical ability, including his skill at orchestration, to the thorough grounding in counterpoint, harmony and musical theory he received at the Conservatory. Without that grounding, Tchaikovsky might {{not have been able to}} write what would become his greatest works.|$|E
5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Burger's Daughter came when Gordimer {{was waiting to}} visit a political detainee in prison, and amongst the other visitors she saw a school girl, {{the daughter of an}} activist she knew. She <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> this child was thinking and what family obligations were making her stand there. The novel opens with the same scene: a 14-year-old Rosa Burger waiting outside a prison to visit her detained mother. Gordimer said that children like these, whose activist parents were frequently arrested and detained, periodically had to manage entire households on their own, and it must have changed their lives completely. She stated that it was these children who encouraged her to write the book.|$|E
5|$|Such densities are {{possible}} because white dwarf material is not composed of atoms joined by chemical bonds, but rather {{consists of a}} plasma of unbound nuclei and electrons. There is therefore no obstacle to placing nuclei closer than normally allowed by electron orbitals limited by normal matter. Eddington <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> would happen when this plasma cooled and the energy to keep the atoms ionized was no longer sufficient. This paradox was resolved by R. H. Fowler in 1926 by an application of the newly devised quantum mechanics. Since electrons obey the Pauli exclusion principle, no two electrons can occupy the same state, and they must obey Fermi–Dirac statistics, also introduced in 1926 to determine the statistical distribution of particles which satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle. At zero temperature, therefore, electrons can not all occupy the lowest-energy, or ground, state; {{some of them would}} have to occupy higher-energy states, forming a band of lowest-available energy states, the Fermi sea. This state of the electrons, called degenerate, meant that a white dwarf could cool to zero temperature and still possess high energy.|$|E

5|$|The character's {{change in}} Part II (Naruto Shippuden) has been praised for {{being one of}} the most {{developed}} ones in the series by Anime News Network's Casey Brienza, as she has become stronger than her Part I (Naruto) counterpart which, was considerably weaker than Naruto and Sasuke. This allows her to take a more active and appealing role in the series. Major praise has been given to her encounters with Sasori and Sasuke owing to her fighting skills and mature reactions, respectively. Sakura's love confession to Naruto in later parts of the series has been commented {{to be one of the}} deepest lines and part of the story arc, for bringing confusion into the mix in regards to whether or not, her love confession claim is as serious as her intention to stop Naruto's suffering. It also came as a surprise as fans <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> were Sakura's real intention regarding Sasuke who had become a dangerous criminal during such a time in the series. Jason Thompson believes Sakura's feelings were well-handled by Kishimoto. While disliking the romance between Sasuke and Sakura in the original series as she felt it was initially a crush on Sakura's part, Amy McNulty believed the spin-off manga Naruto Gaiden helps to expand the bond between these two as well as their relationship with their daughter, Sarada. Sarah Nelkin from Anime Now praised Sakura's development across the series, mostly in late parts of the series due to how she turns into a stronger person as she grows up most notably when she becomes an adult.|$|E

To remix the album in 5.1, certain sections had to be re-recorded, as they {{were lost in the}} subsequent eight years - this made the idea of using drums for the entire album an increasingly viable option.|$|E

25|$|McGovern {{had failed}} to act quickly when he learned of the mental health {{problems}} (though not their severe extent) because his own daughter was seriously depressed and he <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> effect dumping Eagleton because of his depression would have on her. Ultimately, Eagleton threatened that if McGovern tried to force him off the ticket, he would fight the move. Eagleton conditioned his resignation on McGovern's releasing a statement, written by Eagleton, that Eagleton's health was fine and that McGovern had no issues with Eagleton's mental status.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the mounting crisis in Vietnam, she returned to service 13 May 1965 and embarked 2,497 troops of the U.S. 101st Airborne Division for Southeast Asia. Painted entirely gray, {{and not in the}} best of condition, the ship lost all power and was stranded at sea until it was towed to Midway Island. The troops disembarked and waited for another World War II carrier to take them to Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam. One of the paratroopers <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> battle General Eltinge had lost to have such an apparently sorry ship named after him.|$|E

They did as the wise woman said, and freed the moon. From this time on the moon has shone brighter over the boglands than anywhere else, and the evil things were chased from the Carland.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of February 2, 2014, just after 7:30a.m., the steel support cables that {{stretched}} from end-to-end of stadium that held together the roof were severed, as construction crews set off a simultaneous set of 42 explosive charges that detached the cables from the concrete structure. The general public was not informed about {{this phase of the}} demolition process, prompting about a half-dozen phone calls to police from people who <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> was going on. This was viewed as the final step before the destruction of the concrete bowl of the Metrodome would begin. On February 10, 2014, shortly after 9:15a.m., after more than two months of preliminary work that dated back {{all the way to the}} groundbreaking of the new Vikings stadium, demolition of the stadium walls finally began.|$|E
25|$|After he {{attained}} arhatship, {{he began}} to think deeply of his parents, and <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> happened to them. He used his clairvoyance to see where they were reborn and found his father in the heavenly realms i.e. {{the realm of the}} gods. However, his mother had been reborn in a lower realm, known as Avīci, or the Realm of Hungry Ghosts. His mother took on the form of a hungry ghost (preta)– so called because it could not eat due to its highly thin and fragile throat in which no food could pass through, yet it was always hungry because it had a fat belly. His mother had been greedy with the money he left her. He had instructed her to kindly host any Buddhist monks that ever came her way, but instead she withheld her kindness and her money. It was for this reason she was reborn in the realm of hungry ghosts.|$|E
25|$|However, Bohr {{had argued}} that the {{uranium-235}} isotope was {{far more likely to}} capture neutrons and fission even from neutrons with the low energies produced by fission. Frisch began experimenting uranium enrichment through thermal diffusion, a process first demonstrated in Germany by Klaus Clusius. Progress was slow; the required equipment was not available, and the radar project had first call on the available resources. He <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> would happen if he were able to produce a sphere of pure uranium-235. When he used Peierls' formula to calculate its critical mass, he received a startling answer: less than a kilogram would be required. Frisch and Peierls produced the Frisch–Peierls memorandum in March 1940. They reported that a 5 kilogram bomb would be the equivalent to several thousand tons of dynamite, and even a one kilogram bomb would be impressive. Because of the potential radioactive fallout, they thought that the British might find it morally unacceptable.|$|E

25|$|The fictional {{history of}} Westeros {{stretches}} back some twelve thousand years. The Ice and Fire story {{can be considered}} to be set in a post-magic world where people no longer believe in dragons and the Others. The characters understand only the natural aspects of their world, but the magical elements like the Others are not within their understanding. Coming from an impoverished family background of former wealth, Martin always felt attracted to stories of fallen civilizations and lost empires. The lost empire of Valyria in Ice and Fire was once a high civilization similar to Rome before the Dark Ages. These elements may give the story a poignant sadness. The Wall, which Martin believes to be unique in fantasy, was inspired by Martin's visit to Hadrian's Wall in the North of England close to the border with Scotland. Looking out over the hills, Martin <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> a Roman centurion from the Mediterranean would feel, not knowing what threats might come from the north. The size, length and magical powers of the wall were adjusted for genre demands. Similarly the Titan, an extremely large statue in the city of Braavos, is comparable to the real life Colossus of Rhodes.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Hook arrives to the mansion to warn Emma, but Gold thwarts his efforts, erases his {{phone calls to}} Emma, and ties him to the fence. Inside the mansion, Elsa finds Emma and tells her that she sees her {{doing the same thing}} that she once did, blaming herself {{for not being able to}} control her powers because her family was harmed, and that she should be blessed to have this gift. Elsa then asks Emma for her hand and she takes it, {{resulting}} in Emma's powers returning to normal. Outside, Gold, upset over what he just saw, becomes furious over his failed attempt to take Emma's power, which pleased Hook. However, Gold says that despite the setback, he will find a way to acquire the power to free him of the Dagger of Kris. But Gold also needs another item: the heart of someone who knew Gold before he became the Dark One. Since Killian is the only one left alive, Gold takes his heart. By doing so, Gold makes Killian his puppet and vows to use him to find another way to get Emma's powers, before he will kill him. As Hook reunites with Emma and kisses her, Emma <b>wondered</b> <b>what</b> got into him, and after she and Elsa walk away, he grabs the Sorcerer's box and hides it inside the jacket. Regina arrives at the library, where Robin shows her a page that featured the two together at the pub back in the Enchanted Forest, leading to indications that whoever wrote the story wanted them to be together. Back at the Snow Queen's lair, Ingrid, now free of the force field, follows through with her plan to bring her three sisters together by sending out her ribbons to Emma and Elsa. As Emma and Elsa are reunited with David, Mary Margaret, and Henry, she unleashed her magic into the sky, which creates colorful auroras and then fireworks. Unfortunately, Emma and Elsa notice the yellow ribbons on their left wrists too late, and that they can't remove their ribbons, even while the ribbons are siphoning away their power.|$|E
