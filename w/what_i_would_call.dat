Drake has been cited {{as an example of a}} male character who, while attractive, is not over-masculine. One commentator pointed out: [...] "Very few of our protagonists (Nathan Drake and Alan Wake to name a few exceptions) depict men in <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> a non-degrading manner." [...] Steve McGarvey of GameSpy wrote that Drake was: [...] "hardly oozing with machismo compared to the likes of most gaming protagonists". Drake's attractiveness drew criticism from Meagan Marie of Game Informer, who stated that he did not: [...] "stand out much among the crowd of other ideally proportioned and intentionally unblemished gaming icons." [...] GameDaily named Drake the third greatest gaming hunk. GamesRadar named Drake [...] "Mister 2007", stating that he was not picked just because they could [...] "stare at his ass for hours on end", but because he is heroic and has a [...] "winning attitude". In 2014, La Nueva España included him the top ten sexiest video game characters of both genders.|$|E

500|$|Hillenburg {{made his}} first {{animated}} works, short films The Green Beret and Wormholes (both 1992), while at CalArts. The Green Beret was about a physically-challenged Girl Scout with enormous fists who toppled houses and destroyed neighborhoods while trying to sell Girl Scout cookies. Wormholes, on the other hand, was his seven-minute thesis film, about the theory of relativity. He described it as [...] "a poetic animated film based on relativistic phenomena", in his grant proposal in 1991 to the Princess Grace Foundation, which assists emerging artists in American theater, dance, and film. The foundation agreed to fund the effort, providing Hillenburg with a Graduate Film Scholarship. [...] "It meant a lot. They funded one of the projects I'm most proud of, even with SpongeBob. It provided me the opportunity just {{to make a film}} that was personal, and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> independent, and free of some of the commercial needs," [...] he said in 2003. Wormholes was shown at several international animation festivals, including the Annecy International Animated Film Festival, the Hiroshima International Animation Festival, the Los Angeles International Animation Celebration, the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen, and the Ottawa International Animation Festival, where it won Best Concept. LA Weekly labeled the film [...] "road-trippy" [...] and [...] "Zap-comical", while Manohla Dargis of The New York Times opined that it was inventive.|$|E

People may have to think a little bit more. The production is a lot bigger and more advanced than it's been. Lyrically, as an artist, I think I've written {{some of the best}} lyrics I've ever written." [...] Lecrae provided insight into the album's concept during an interview with Family Christian, stating that [...] "Gravity is loosely based on Ecclesiastes and I think what Solomon was trying to do was bring some weight to life and that’s really what I want to do, to paint some sober pictures." [...] He described that [...] "there’s a sober picture of how it’s only {{for a short period of}} time, it’s short-lived, or that we still have Jesus. So that’s <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> a weighty part, a gravitational pull to remind us of who we are in Jesus." [...] Billboard stated that Lecrae increased his level of production for Gravity and [...] "mixed reggae and soul influences with his signature brash sound." [...] AllHipHop described the album as opening with [...] "an influx of instruments like violin, drums, guitars". [...] "I Know" [...] was described as having one of the hardest beats on the album, while [...] "Mayday" [...] was considered one of the most [...] "organic" [...] sounding tracks. [...] "Violence" [...] was considered one of the most energetic tracks, and was described as [...] "caribbean-esque" [...] with a dancehall vibe. After the music video for [...] "Lord Have Mercy" [...] was released, an article in The Christian Post article compared the song to the Kanye West single [...] "Mercy", both in its title and musical style. The article elaborated that [...] "like Kanye West's song, [...] "'Lord Have Mercy' features slowed down sampled vocals for its chorus along with heavy bass and an overall dark tone."

Wilson talked of Spector's influence on his work, having learned how to produce records through attending his sessions, and in a 1988 interview, Wilson asserted that the album aspired to [...] "extend" [...] Spector's music, that [...] "in one sense of the word, we [...] were his messengers." [...] In Pet Sounds, Wilson sought to emulate Spector's Wall of Sound, driven by his fascination with [...] "combining one [...] to make another... It's amazing". Shortly before the album's release, Wilson spoke of recent popular music trends, saying [...] " [...] helped the Beach Boys evolve. We listen to what's happening and it affects what we do too. The trends have influenced my work, but so has my own scene." [...] In 1996, Wilson said of his partnership with Asher: [...] "none of us looked back... We went forward, kind of like on our own little wavelength. It wasn't like we were thinking, 'Okay, let's beat Spector,' let's out-do Motown.'

Couture-Rouleau and Zehaf-Bibeau were [...] "both self-radicalized and adrift in their lives and connected in their sympathy to radical Islamic ideology." [...] Other opinions diverged from simply calling Zehaf-Bibeau a terrorist. Vancouver Sun columnist Ian Mulgrew commented on how the incident, as well as a failed bombing attempt in Victoria by persons motivated similarly to Zehaf-Bibeau, showed 'gaping holes' in the social security net.

I do not believe that it was a vast network, or that the country is more at risk today than it was last week. However, that is my opinion.

2500|$|Giles and O'Keefe {{have been}} criticized for {{accuracy}} problems. Their videos include the oft-repeated conservative claim that ACORN is expected to get up to $8.5 billion in government funds. But that's a bold exaggeration, as it includes $3 billion in stimulus funds set aside for revitalization efforts nationwide, and $5.5 billion in federal community development grants.The more than $8 billion number was based on the false assumption that ACORN would apply for and win every project and grant in the country, and in fact ACORN did not apply for any of the stimulus funds. Leonnig also observed:the videos, in some cases, left out <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> some exculpatory material ... for example, in one, a San Bernadino employee at ACORN explains {{that there is no way}} ACORN would support what the couple were proposing, and she asks if they are putting her on, candid-camera style.During a September 14 television appearance on FOX, O'Keefe appeared dressed in a fur coat, sunglasses, and holding a cane. The host announced: [...] " [...] is dressed exactly in the same outfit that he wore to these ACORN offices up and down the eastern seaboard." [...] He asked, [...] "s that what you think a pimp looks like?" [...] O'Keefe answered yes. Within weeks, political journalist Mike Stark revealed that O'Keefe did not wear such clothing to the ACORN offices, but rather he wore subdued clothing and a tie, and in one instance posed as a candidate for Congress. Stark said, [...] "If they really wanted the truth out there, why do they need to edit these tapes in the first place? Why aren't the unedited videos already in the public domain?" ...|$|E
