30|$|The {{interaction}} between rail and wheel influences safety {{and efficiency of}} railway service. The knowledge in contact phenomena, in both the surface characteristics and the contact mechanics [1, 2], may improve the accuracy in evaluating wheel–rail contact functional performance, and ensure the related prediction of local stresses. High vertical contact forces, also <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lateral and longitudinal ones, induce stresses that may produce fatigue failure of the material [3]. High contact stresses and rolling resistance induce friction heating and consequently wear [4]. Thus, traction and braking may lead to wheel sliding, which results in rail burn, wheel flat, unfavorable material phase transformation, and thermal cracks [5]. In addition to wear, fatigue, crack formation, and other permanent deformations, there is {{a particular type of}} defect which affects the rail surface called “Rail Corrugation”. This is a kind of periodic wear that is often visible <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eyes</b> and can be identified as the pattern on the rail has regular spacing.|$|R

50|$|The {{critical}} question {{for all three}} writers was whether the new phenomenon could be explained within the generally-accepted model of the universe, known as the Aristotelian model or the Ptolmaic system.

An unusual event in the sky might take place close to the earth, and could therefore be explained within the standard cosmological model.

30|$|The loop-mediated {{isothermal}} amplification (LAMP) method, {{developed in}} 2000 by Notomi et al. (2000) as a novel nucleic acid detection, is a desirable diagnostic tool for on-site epidemiological investigations of bacterial infection. Relying on its convenient operation, {{the short time}} required for results, and the high specificity, the LAMP method {{has been used in}} aquaculture as an effective method for pathogen detection. LAMP has been used widely for Vibrio detection in fish disease and shows high specificity, sensitivity and rapidity under isothermal conditions when used to identify a single Vibrio. Single pathogen LAMPs have been developed for Vibrio parahaemolyticus (Yamazaki et al. 2008), Vibrio nigripulchritudo (Fall et al. 2008), and Vibrio alginolyticus (Cai et al. 2010). In addition, many multiplex loop-mediated isothermal amplification (mLAMP) methods emerged in response to the need to detect two or more pathogens in one reaction system, and these mLAMP assays combined <b>the</b> LAMP technique <b>with</b> restriction enzyme analysis, constructing an original cleavage site within the amplification products rather than within the designed primers (Iwamoto et al. 2003; Iseki et al. 2007) to make this method more convenient and efficient in practice. This method has been used to confirm whether the amplification products are rooted in the target genes. He and Xu (2011) have successfully reported an mLAMP that detected two virus-inserted restriction enzyme cleavage sites in two pairs of species-specific primers, and Yu et al. (2013) developed a triLAMP (triplex loop-mediated isothermal amplification, triLAMP) method for detecting three Vibrio species successfully by designing primer sets with one or two restriction enzyme sites contained in the inner primers of each set. In addition, the results can be detected <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eyes</b> by <b>the</b> addition of SYBR Green I, which is an important advantage {{in the development of a}} simple and rapid diagnostic tool.|$|R

60|$|Exper. 5. Now, {{that these}} Colours {{could not be}} changed by Refraction, I knew by refracting with a Prism {{sometimes}} one very little Part of this Light, sometimes another very little Part, as is described in the twelfth Experiment of the first Part of this Book. For by this Refraction the Colour of the Light was never changed in the least. If any Part of the red Light was refracted, it remained totally of the same red Colour as before. No orange, no yellow, no green or blue, no other new Colour was produced by that Refraction. Neither did the Colour any ways change by repeated Refractions, but continued always the same red entirely as at first. The like Constancy and Immutability I found also in the blue, green, and other Colours. So also, if I looked through a Prism upon any Body illuminated with any part of this homogeneal Light, as in the fourteenth Experiment of the first Part of this Book is described; I could not perceive any new Colour generated this way. All Bodies illuminated with compound Light appear through Prisms confused, (as was said above) and tinged with various new Colours, but those illuminated with homogeneal Light appeared through Prisms neither less distinct, nor otherwise colour'd, than when viewed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>Eyes.</b> Their Colours {{were not in the}} least changed by the Refraction of the interposed Prism. I speak here of a sensible Change of Colour: For the Light which I here call homogeneal, being not absolutely homogeneal, there ought to arise some little Change of Colour from its Heterogeneity. But, if that Heterogeneity was so little as it might be made by the said Experiments of the fourth Proposition, that Change was not sensible, and therefore in Experiments, where Sense is Judge, ought to be accounted none at all.|$|R

Results were compared to those of six healthy controls. Our pilot data show clear asymmetries in dynamic balance control, even though patients themselves were not aware of this and had no subjective problems with stability or standing. We also found asymmetries in weight bearing, but the asymmetries in dynamic balance contribution were larger. Finally, asymmetries in weight bearing and dynamic balance in patients were not tightly coupled as in healthy controls.
