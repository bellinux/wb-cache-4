5|$|In the meantime, Romeo and Juliet {{was finally}} staged by the Kirov Ballet, choreographed by Leonid Lavrovsky, on 11 January 1940. To the {{surprise}} of all of its participants, the dancers having struggled {{to cope with the}} music's syncopated rhythms and almost having boycotted the production, the ballet <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> success, and became recognised as the crowning achievement of Soviet dramatic ballet.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{upon the}} {{conclusion}} of the sketch, writer Michael O'Donoghue knew it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> success. He had been watching the Saturday Night Live performance from beside the set, off-camera. He felt that Belushi had performed his role as Captain Kirk perfectly. As soon as Belushi left the set, O'Donoghue went over to him and gave the actor a congratulatory hug. On reflection, after the live performance, O'Donoghue stated that Belushi had performed a perfect parody of Shatner as Kirk. Belushi felt it was one of his most satisfying performances.|$|E
5|$|The Red Hot Chili Peppers had {{released}} Blood Sugar Sex Magik in 1991. The album <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> hit, selling {{over seven}} {{million copies in}} the United States, and turned the band into an international sensation. Guitarist John Frusciante was having difficulty coping with the band's newfound fame and started to dislike it. Frusciante often argued with his bandmates, and sabotaged performances. He began taking heroin and steadily increased his usage of the drug over time. Frusciante quit the band in 1992, during its Japanese leg of the tour. He returned {{to his home in}} California and became a recluse.|$|E

5|$|The part became Hordern's first paid role as {{an actor}} for a theatre company. The play <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> hit and ran at the People's Theatre in Mile End for two weeks.

This allowed Hordern to take his place for which Daltry paid Hordern an extra £1 a week.|$|E
5|$|Virtually {{the entire}} tour <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> sell-out; the four shows at Japan's largest stadium, Tokyo Dome, broke Carey's {{previous}} ticket-sales record, selling out all 200,000 tickets in under one hour. Additionally, the entire Australian leg sold out within hours, leading Carey {{to extend the}} tour one more date in the United States. The show at Hawaii's 50,000 capacity Aloha Stadium sold out as well, making her {{one of the few}} acts in the stadiums history to sell out the entire venue. Aside from its commercial success, fans and critics raved about the show's visuals, as well as Carey's vocal delivery.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, Universal chief Carl Laemmle, Jr. offered Whale {{his choice}} of any {{property}} the studio owned. He chose Frankenstein, mostly because none of Universal's other properties particularly interested him {{and he wanted to}} make something other than a war picture. While the novel itself was in the public domain, Universal owned the filming rights to a stage adaptation by Peggy Webling. Whale cast Colin Clive as Henry Frankenstein and Mae Clarke as his fiancée Elizabeth. For the Monster, he turned to an unknown actor named Boris Karloff. Shooting began on 24 August 1931 and wrapped on 3 October. Previews were held 29 October, with wide release on 21 November. Frankenstein <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> hit with critics and the public. The film received glowing reviews and shattered box office records across the United States, earning Universal $12 million on first release.|$|E
5000|$|An uncommonly {{required}} but [...] "serious consequences" [...] variant {{is that if}} one sinks {{all three}} object balls on the break but also scratches or otherwise fouls, this <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> loss instead of a score of two, taking {{the form of the}} player receiving the maximum allowed score (see above), which is technically still tieable, so not truly <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> loss. This rule <b>is</b> <b>an</b> adaptation from nine-ball and common North American eight-ball, in which sinking the game-winning target ball <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> win unless one also fouls, yielding <b>a</b> (true) <b>instant</b> loss.|$|R

5|$|Culver first {{appeared}} as Casey Donovan in Boys in the Sand, directed by Wakefield Poole, in 1971. The film <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> success {{and is considered}} one of the great classics of male erotic cinema. With the success and celebrity he garnered from the film, Donovan believed that he would be able to cross over into mainstream film. While there were meetings with directors like John Schlesinger and Raymond St. Jacques and talk of casting him in mainstream projects including adaptations of novels by Mary Renault and Patricia Nell Warren, the only film opportunities opened for him were as the star of more erotic films. These included the bisexual porn film Score, The Back Row with George Payne, L. A. Tool & Die with Bob Blount and Richard Locke, The Other Side of Aspen with Al Parker and Dick Fisk, Boys in the Sand II and Inevitable Love, with Jon King and Jamie Wingo. Shortly before his death he starred, heavily intoxicated, in the fisting movie Fucked Up, for Christopher Rage. He also appeared in a number of heterosexual porn films, most notably The Opening of Misty Beethoven where he had a scene with Constance Money.|$|E
5|$|Home Pong <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> success {{following}} its limited 1975 release through Sears; around 150,000units were sold that holiday season. The game became Sears' most successful product at the time, which earned Atari a Sears Quality Excellence Award. Similar to the arcade version, several companies released clones {{to capitalize on}} the home console's success, many of which continued to produce new consoles and video games. Magnavox re-released their Odyssey system with simplified hardware and new features, and would later release updated versions. Coleco entered the video game market with their Telstar console; it features three Pong variants and was also succeeded by newer models. Nintendo released the Color TV Game 6 in 1977, which plays six variations of electronic tennis. The next year, it was followed by an updated version, the Color TV Game 15, which features fifteen variations. The systems were Nintendo's entry into the home video game market and the first to produce themselves—they had previously licensed the Magnavox Odyssey. The dedicated Pong consoles and the numerous clones have since become varying levels of rare; Atari's Pong consoles are common, while APF Electronics' TV Fun consoles are moderately rare. Prices among collectors, however, vary with rarity; the Sears Tele-Games versions are often cheaper than those with the Atari brand.|$|E
5|$|In 1847, Ezra Cornell of Ithaca, New York {{worked to}} expand telegraphic {{communication}} through the New York and Lake Erie Railroad right-of-way with the Western Union Telegraph Company, saving a telegraph line he built from New York City to Fredonia. The new telegraph <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>instant</b> hit, and was commonly used for gossip and casual chatting. The then-superintendent of the New York and Lake Erie, Charles Minot, looked to expand {{this new technology}} with the railroad. He developed a system using telegraphs for train dispatches, for use when trains would want to pass one another along the line, such as at stations. Two-letter telegraph codes were designated, and the new modern system was set up. For the ten years of the new railroad's existence, passengers had been disgusted as trains waited for hours as another train had to pass them. This new system would relieve this issue.|$|E
