2500|$|In October 1997, {{attorney}} Vernon Petria filed {{a lawsuit}} against First Baptist Church of Hammond, accusing the church and its pastor of allowing a mentally retarded woman to be sexually assaulted for six years.

Hyles was sued because he and his church [...] "failed in their duty to protect her," [...] Petri said. The lawsuit alleged this was a pattern of assault can be traced to a Sunday in 1991, when a First Baptist teacher saw someone abusing the woman and reported it to church leaders and police, but the parents were never told and she kept going to church, where she was threatened into silence. The sexual abuse ended when the woman [...] "developed a horrible infection and was taken to a doctor {{to find out what was}} wrong," [...] Petri said.
