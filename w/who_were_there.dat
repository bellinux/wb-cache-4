Shortly afterwards, another four people on the square set themselves alight. One of the four, a man, was detained and driven away in a police van.|$|E

25|$|However, {{collaboration}} {{is not the}} whole story. While {{there is little doubt}} that there were strong antisemitic feelings in Belgium, after November 1942, the German roundups became less successful as large-scale rescue operations were carried out by ordinary Belgians. This resulted in the survival of about 25,000 Jews from Belgium. Unlike other states, which were immediately annexed, Belgium was initially placed under German military administration, which the Belgian authorities exploited by refusing to carry out some of the Nazi directives against the Jews. Roughly 60 percent of Belgium's Jews, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> at the start of the war, survived the Final Solution.|$|E
25|$|I {{was at the}} Sydney Cricket Ground in 1982 {{when this}} unknown Canberra teenage fullback was playing in what was {{regarded}} {{as something of a}} trial, a curtain raiser to a Test against a New Zealand Under 21 side, though rarely did anyone from such a trial graduate immediately to much else. People were wandering into the ground and those <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> gave little attention to what was happening on the paddock.

Under the Bush Administration, a criminal investigation into the incident was started, but later dropped. In January 2009, less than two weeks before the Bush Administration left office, the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice filed a civil suit under the Voting Rights Act against four defendants, namely, Minister King Samir Shabazz, Jerry Jackson, NBPP chairman Malik Zulu Shabazz, and the NBPP itself. The lawsuit accused them of using uniforms, racial insults and a weapon to intimidate voters and those <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> to assist them.

Cao Pi {{promoted}} Zhang Liao to General of the Vanguard (前將軍) and awarded him with 1,000 rolls of silk and 10,000 hu of grain. When Sun Quan renounced his allegiance to Wei, Cao Pi ordered Zhang Liao to garrison at Hefei again to guard against possible attacks from Wu, and increased his marquis rank to Marquis of a Chief District (都鄉侯). Cao Pi also gave Zhang Liao's mother a carriage, sent soldiers to serve as guards in Zhang's residence, and invited Zhang's mother to visit Luoyang. When Zhang Liao's mother arrived, Cao Pi {{went out of the}} city and personally welcomed her. All the officials <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> lined the path and paid respect to her.|$|E

The video and a similar one posted on the web site of the Lexington Herald-Leader newspaper attracted the attention of television producer Matt Sharp of Sharp Entertainment. Brown relates that, while performing as a sideshow at the Mothman Festival in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, a group of executives from Sharp Entertainment and Animal Planet, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> on an unrelated assignment, approached him about doing a television show.

25|$|The Iranian Revolution was a gendered revolution; {{much of the}} new regime’s rhetoric was {{centered}} on the position of women in Iranian society. Beyond rhetoric, thousands of women were also heavily mobilized in the revolution itself, and different groups of women actively participated alongside their male counterparts. Not only participating through voting, women contributed to the revolution through marches, demonstrations and chanting slogans. The revolution was non-violent in nature which facilitated women’s involvement within it. For example, women were involved in caring for the wounded, female doctors responding to calls for help and opening their homes for those who needed assistance. While women themselves were often killed, tortured, arrested or injured and some were involved in guerilla activities, most contributed in non-violent ways. Many women were instrumental not only in being involved in the revolution themselves but in mobilizing men and other non-political women. Many women protested while carrying children and their presence {{was one of the main}} reasons for disarming soldiers (<b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> on behalf of the regime) who were ordered to shoot if necessary.|$|E
25|$|Shortly before 10 a.m. on June 25, 1996, {{members of}} a {{terrorist}} group detonated a truck bomb outside building 131 (also known as Khobar Towers) of the King Abdul Aziz Air Base. Inside the building were almost exclusively members of the US Air Force <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> to patrol the southern Iraqi no-fly zone enacted after the Gulf War. In the attack, 19 US military personnel and a Saudi local were killed and 372 were wounded, making this the most deadly terrorist attack on Americans abroad since the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing. Louis Freeh said in his book My FBI that he felt the deepest about the Khobar Towers investigation, {{and it was not}} until his last day in office, June 21, 2001, a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia returned a 46-count indictment against 14 defendants charged with the Khobar Towers attack. This was just before some of the counts would have expired due to a five-year statute of limitations. In the book, Freeh maintains that he was obstructed by the Clinton Administration for political reasons in investigating the bombing and bringing the terrorists to justice.|$|E

[...] There was further difficulties in production as Zicree also hired a professional assistant director, but he walked off set during a night shoot early in the production and did not return. Cawley later said [...] "Marc is all about using this production to further his own career, a stark difference between his goal {{and all the others}} <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> doing it, did we aspire to be a pro-looking production?

500|$|The Beatles {{steadily}} improved {{during their}} time in Hamburg, and this was noticed by other musicians <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> at the time.

The accolade of accolades was when Sheridan would {{come in from the}} Top Ten (the big club where we aspired to go) or when Rory Storm or Ringo [...] would hang around to watch us. ‘What'd I Say’ was always the one that really got them." [...] The song was often played by the group, once being played for 90 minutes non-stop, with group members walking off stage to wash and drink before returning. Sutcliffe wrote a letter to his mother saying, [...] "We have improved a thousand-fold since our arrival and Allan Williams, who is here at the moment, tells us that there is no group in Liverpool to touch us." ...|$|E

Mikhail Tanich was a political prisoner, but he came to sympathize with many of the other prisoners who were serving in the camps, some who were falsely accused and some <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> for petty crimes. He has stated that Chanson music [...] "blossomed wildly in Soviet times when the entire country was in camps, when these zones, barbed wire, guard towers with guards and machine guns, were everywhere," [...] and he has said that he feels that everyone in Russia is in some way connected to the camps and to criminal life.|$|E

500|$|In 2014, Hastert's firm Dickstein Shapiro and the {{lobbying}} firm of former House majority leader-turned lobbyist Dick Gephardt split a $1.4 million annual lobbying {{contract with the}} government of Turkey. In April 2013, Hastert and Gephardt traveled with eight members of Congress to Turkey, with all expenses paid by the Turkish government. While members of Congress are generally prohibited from corporate-funded travel abroad with lobbyists (a rule enacted after the Abramoff scandal), the law permits lobbyists to plan and attend trips overseas if paid for by foreign countries. Hastert defended the trip, saying that he had [...] "meticulously" [...] followed the rules and that the involvement of himself and Gephardt [...] "allowed those members of Congress <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>there</b> to have a fuller experience." [...] A National Journal investigation highlighted the trip as an example of loopholes creating a situation in which [...] "lobbyists who can't legally buy a lawmaker a sandwich can still escort members on trips all around the world." ...|$|E

[...] Speaking to The Independent later that month, Hitchcock director Sacha Gervasi said, [...] " [...] seems a rare one-note portrayal {{of a man who was}} a little more complex than that. A lot of people, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>there,</b> do not recognise this portrayal of him as this monster". Danny Huston, who played screenwriter Whitfield Cook in Hitchcock, told WENN.com that he believed Hitchcock would not have contested Hedren's account of him: [...] "Hitchcock was such a deliciously dark character that I don't think he would dismiss what Tippi was saying as not true." ...|$|E
