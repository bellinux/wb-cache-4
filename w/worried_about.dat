5|$|As Ironside was a {{marginal}} operation, {{and they were}} <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> exposing agents as false, the Twenty Committee {{for the most part}} utilised less important agents and added words of caution to the messages they sent, reducing the impact of the story. Allied landings around Bordeaux may also have seemed implausible because it was beyond air cover from the UK and lacked the normal physical elements (such as naval activities and dummy landing craft) associated with an invasion.|$|E

The generals were correct.|$|E

5|$|By 1990, Moffat {{had written}} two series of Press Gang, but the programme's high cost along with {{organisational}} changes at Central cast its future in doubt. As Moffat wondered {{what to do}} next and <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> his future employment, Bob Spiers, Press Gangs primary director, suggested that he meet with producer Andre Ptaszynski to discuss writing a sitcom. Moffat's father had been a headteacher and Moffat himself had taught English before writing Press Gang, so his initial proposal was a programme similar to what would become Chalk, a series that eventually aired in 1997.|$|E

50|$|What the relativists -- {{so-called}} -- {{want us to}} <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> is provincialism -- {{the danger}} that our perceptions will be dulled, our intellects constricted, and our sympathies narrowed by the overlearned and overvalued acceptances of our own society. What the anti-relativists -- self-declared -- want us to <b>worry</b> <b>about,</b> and <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> and <b>worry</b> <b>about,</b> as though our very souls depended on it, {{is a kind of}} spiritual entropy, a heat death of the mind, in which everything is as significant, and thus as insignificant, as everything else: anything goes, to each his own, you pays your money and you takes your choice, I know what I like, not in the couth, tout comprendre, c'est tout pardonner.|$|R
40|$|Public insecurities {{about crime}} are widely assumed to erode {{individual}} well-being and community cohesion. Yet, robust {{evidence on the}} link between <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> crime and health is surprisingly scarce. This paper draws on data from a prospective cohort study (the Whitehall II study) to show a strong statistical effect of mental health and physical functioning on <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> crime. Combining with existing evidence, we suggest a feedback model in which <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> crime harms health, which, in turn, serves to heighten <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> crime. We conclude with the idea that, while fear of crime may express {{a whole set of}} social and political anxieties, there is a core to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> crime that is implicated in real cycles of decreased health and perceived vulnerability to victimization. The challenge for future study is to integrate core aspects of the everyday experience of fear of crime with the more layered and expressive features of this complex social phenomenon...|$|R

5|$|Ingres' {{portrait}} of Bertin {{was a critical}} and popular success, but the sitter was a private person. Although his family <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> caricature and disapproved, it became widely known and sealed the artist's reputation. It was praised at the Paris Salon of 1833, and has been influential to both academic painters such as Léon Bonnat and later modernists including Pablo Picasso and Félix Vallotton. Today art critics regard it as Ingres' finest male portrait. It has been on permanent display at the Musée du Louvre since 1897.|$|E
5|$|Initially Boutonnat and Dahan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to find a record company who would release the track, either because labels were <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the song being censored due to the sexual nature of its lyrics or because they did not see any commercial potential in the track. In order to get a second appointment with RCA records the pair claimed they had remixed the song, even though they had not. Only after a third appointment with RCA did the label's Francis Dacla give them a contract.|$|E
5|$|Iwane Matsui {{was born}} in Nagoya on July 27, 1878. He was the sixth son of Takekuni Matsui, an impoverished samurai and former {{retainer}} to the daimyō of Owari during the Tokugawa shogunate. After completing elementary school, his parents insisted that he continue his education, but Matsui <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> his father's debts {{and did not want}} to burden him financially. Though he was a short, thin, and sickly young man, Matsui opted for a career in the Army, because in Japan at that time military schools charged the lowest tuition fees.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Little {{is known}} about the {{relationship}} of <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia with diabetes-specific and typical youth behaviors among emerging adults with type 1 diabetes. This study's purpose was to examine the relationship among <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia, diabetes management, and glycemic control within the context of alcohol use, hypoglycemia-related weight control behaviors, depressive symptoms, and impulse control among emerging adults with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The sample was 181 emerging adults with type 1 diabetes who were part of a larger study. Path analysis was used to test associations among <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia, diabetes management, hypoglycemia-related weight control behaviors (WCB), alcohol use, impulse control, depressive symptoms, and glycemic control. RESULTS: Path model fit and modification indices suggested that a feedback loop between <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia and diabetes management should be incorporated into the original model. Youth with fewer depressive symptoms reported fewer hypoglycemia-related WCB and less <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia; those with higher impulse control had less alcohol use and better diabetes management; those with lower alcohol use had more <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia; and better glycemic control was associated with better diabetes management. CONCLUSIONS: Health care professionals need to understand how multiple factors related to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> hypoglycemia and diabetes management interact in emerging adults. In the context of depressive symptoms, impulse control, alcohol use, and hypoglycemia-related WCB, the path model results suggest several potential avenues for intervening to improve glycemic control in emerging adults...|$|R
