The fourth festival, held between September 21 and September 24 in 2006, had 21 participating countries and 41 competing films. The fifth Matsalu Nature Film Festival was held between September 19 and September 23, 2007, and had more than 7,000 visitors. Organizers admit that as the festival is held on a nature reserve, it cannot grow much larger in a little town and therefore plan to bring mostly European nature documentaries to the festival, {{at the same time}} not forgetting the human-related topics.|$|E

The participants were separated into four groups: (a) <b>participants</b> <b>with</b> language learning disabilities (LLD; n = 14), (b) <b>participants</b> <b>with</b> attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; n = 26), (c) <b>participants</b> <b>with</b> both ADHD and LLD (ADHD/ LLD; n = 18), (d) <b>participants</b> <b>with</b> neither ADHD nor LLD (Neither; n = 38). <b>Participants</b> <b>with</b> ADHD/LLD performed significantly more poorly than did the ADHD group or the Neither group on measures of phonology and syntax, but not semantics. However, <b>participants</b> <b>with</b> ADHD/LLD did not significantly differ from <b>participants</b> <b>with</b> LLD on a majority of language-based measures. This finding suggests that <b>participants</b> <b>with</b> ADHD/LLD have profiles more {{similar to those of}} <b>participants</b> <b>with</b> LLD than <b>participants</b> <b>with</b> ADHD.

40|$|Abstract: Severe Oxidative stress {{has been}} {{reported}} in Tuberculosis infected individuals as a result of tissue inflammation, poor nutrition and poor immunity and this stress becomes more severe in those co-infected with HIV. Therefore the present study was designed to assess the antioxidant status of HIV infected <b>participants</b> <b>with</b> or without tuberculosis co-infections and in HIV seronegative <b>participants</b> infected <b>with</b> tuberculosis. 193 <b>participants</b> were randomly recruited for the study and grouped into: (i) Symptomatic HIV infected <b>participants</b> <b>with</b> tuberculosis co-infections (n = 67) (ii) symptomatic HIV infected participants without tuberculosis (n = 45) (iii) HIV seronegative <b>participants</b> <b>with</b> Tuberculosis (n = 52) and (IV) HIV seronegative control participants without tuberculosis (n = 29). Blood samples collected from the participants were used for HIV screening, CD 4 +T cell count, glutathione reductase activity, glutathione peroxidase activity, Total Antioxidant Status and albumin estimations. The results showed that glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase and Total Antioxidant Status were significantly lowered in both HIV infected <b>participants</b> <b>with</b> or without tuberculosis and HIV seronegative <b>participants</b> <b>with</b> tuberculosis (P< 0. 01), compared (in each case) <b>with</b> HIV seronegative <b>participants</b> without tuberculosis.
