5|$|Terminate {{aid to the}} ARVN Special Forces of Colonel Lê Quang Tung, <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> orders {{directly}} from the palace and not the army command. Tung had led the raids on Buddhist pagodas on August 21 in which hundreds were killed and widespread physical destruction occurred. The Special Forces were used mainly for repressing dissidents rather than fighting communists.|$|E
5|$|Another {{much earlier}} Puranic {{character}} associated with Kerala is Mahabali, an Asura and a prototypical just king, who ruled the earth from Kerala. He {{won the war}} against the Devas, driving them into exile. The Devas pleaded before Lord Vishnu, <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> fifth incarnation as Vamana and pushed Mahabali down to Patala (the netherworld) to placate the Devas. There is a belief that, once a year during the Onam festival, Mahabali returns to Kerala. The Matsya Purana, among the oldest of the 18 Puranas, uses the Malaya Mountains of Kerala (and Tamil Nadu) as the setting for the story of Matsya, the first incarnation of Vishnu, and Manu, the first man and the king of the region.|$|E

The two continued their rivalry up to Armageddon, where Cena retained his championship. After defeating JBL at the Royal Rumble, Cena lost the championship at No Way Out to Edge, after Kofi Kingston was attacked by Edge, <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> place in the Elimination Chamber match. Cena was {{given an opportunity to}} regain the title at WrestleMania XXV in a triple threat match also involving Big Show, which Cena won.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Nhu {{prepared}} the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces commanded by Colonel Lê Quang Tung— <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> orders directly from Nhu {{and not the}} senior generals— for the raids. An American-trained outfit created to fight the Việt Cộng, the Special Forces were better-equipped, better-trained and better-paid than the regular army, but were used by the Ngô family as a private army for repressing dissidents and protecting their rule, rather than fighting for the national interest. As such, they spent {{the majority of their}} time in Saigon warding off coup attempts. Tung brought more Special Forces into Saigon, bringing the total from two to four battalions in the capital.|$|E
5|$|Time on Earth is {{the fifth}} studio album by the pop-rock band Crowded House. Tracks have been {{produced}} by both Ethan Johns and Steve Lillywhite and the album was released on 30 June 2007 in Australia, 2 July in the United Kingdom and 10 July in North America. Time on Earth is the band's first studio album since 1993, and marks the reunion of the band eleven years after they disbanded and features new drummer Matt Sherrod {{in place of the}} original drummer, Paul Hester, <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> own life in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Wisden {{believed}} that Jardine's effective batting technique meant that fast bowlers troubled him less than other batsmen. He did have difficulties {{with a few}} bowlers. Alec Kennedy, a medium paced inswing bowler, took Jardine's wicket eleven times, eight of these occasions before the batsman had scored 20 runs. Kennedy found that Jardine had slightly slow footwork, often bowling him or trapping him lbw. Bert Ironmonger also troubled Jardine, taking his wicket {{in five of the}} eleven Test innings in which they faced each other. Jardine displayed a slight weakness against Australian slow bowlers, not moving his feet well enough against them. In 16 Test innings in Australia, he was out to slow bowlers ten times, but he rarely experienced similar difficulties against English spinners. One other bowler to cause Jardine problems was the Australian paceman Tim Wall, <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> wicket five times on the nine occasions he bowled to him.|$|E

25|$|The 2010 WRC season {{started with}} the snow-based Swedish Rally, where Loeb {{finished}} second behind Ford's Mikko Hirvonen. He went on to take a clear championship lead by winning the following three gravel events: Rally México, Jordan Rally and Rally of Turkey. In New Zealand, Loeb finished third in a tight battle that saw the top five finish within 26 seconds of each other. In Portugal, Loeb narrowly lost the win to his countryman Sébastien Ogier of the Citroën Junior Team, <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> debut win in the World Rally Championship. In the following Rally Bulgaria, a new event in the series and the season's first tarmac rally, Loeb won while Citroën scored the WRC's first 1–2–3–4 in seventeen years.|$|E
25|$|On {{the last}} day of the Delhi Test against England in December 1984, with his score on 41, Patil was caught at long on {{attempting}} a big hit off the bowling of Phil Edmonds. This triggered a collapse and India lost the match that could well have been saved. Patil was dropped in the next test at Kolkata as a disciplinary measure, along with Kapil Dev who also fell to a similar shot off the bowling of Pat Pocock. Mohammad Azharuddin <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> place scored hundreds in his first three Test matches and Patil played no more Test cricket, although Kapil Dev would return to squad. In 1986, he was recalled for a few more one day matches. He also toured England without appearing in Tests.|$|E
25|$|Aurelian {{was born}} on 9 September, most likely in 214 AD, {{although}} 215 AD is also possible. The ancient sources are not agreed on his place of birth, although he was generally accepted as being a native of Illyricum. Sirmium in Pannonia Inferior (now Sremska Mitrovica, Serbia) is the preferred location, which was created by Aurelian as Emperor when he abandoned the old trans-Danubian territory of Dacia. The academic consensus {{is that he was}} of humble birth and that his father was a peasant-farmer <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> Roman nomen from his landlord, a senator of the clan Aurelius. Saunders suggests that his family might in fact have been of Roman settler origin and of much higher social status; however, his suggestion has not been taken up by his more recent academic colleagues such as Southern and Watson.|$|E

25|$|Zimbabwe won {{the five}} match series 4–1, winning heavily {{in three of}} their four victories. The hosts batted first in the opening match, {{reaching}} 313 largely due to a career-best score of 156 from Hamilton Masakadza. In reply, Kenya did not form any significant partnerships due to the Zimbabweans bowlers taking regular wickets. Steve Tikolo performed best for the tourists, reaching 49, {{but they were all}} out for 222, 91 runs short of Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe batted first again in the second ODI, reaching 263 off their 50 overs, due to an unbeaten 71 from Stuart Matsikenyeri, and 66 from Masakadza. Kenya started well in their reply, with David Obuya scoring rapidly, but he dismissed for 49 by Graeme Cremer, <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> best figures in an ODI, finishing with six wickets. Kenya lost all ten wickets for 177, granting Zimbabwe an 86 run victory.|$|E
25|$|After getting only 2 {{points on}} draws {{in the first}} two games of the four-game homestand, United was desperate for a win when Portland Timbers came to town. The start of the game was delayed an hour because of record-setting heat that {{exceeded}} 100 degrees (on the Fahrenheit scale), but United got off to a hot start themselves. An early corner was headed on by Boswell to Birnbaum, <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> chance on a sharp volley to give D.C. an early lead. The team doubled that lead in the 29th minute, just before a scheduled heat break, when Acosta finished a chance in front of goal, set up by a nifty chipped pass from Mullins. Thanks to the usual heroics by Hamid, the team held on for a 2-0 shutout win that lifted United ahead of New England and at least temporarily holding the sixth and final postseason spot in the East.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand {{started off}} rapidly in their chase, {{thanks to a}} 21-ball fifty from their captain Brendon McCullum <b>who</b> <b>took</b> <b>his</b> team to 72/1 after 7 overs. Soon after, Australia fought back picking up three wickets in five deliveries. New Zealand began {{rebuilding}} with a 52-run partnership between Kane Williamson and Corey Anderson. The partnership was broken when Anderson was dismissed by Glenn Maxwell and the score read 131/5. In the next three overs, Mitchell Starc and Cummins took four more wickets between them, leaving New Zealand at 146/9 in 23 overs. With 6 runs needed from 27 overs, Williamson struck a six off the bowling of Cummins to give New Zealand a memorable one-wicket victory. Williamson ended up with an unbeaten 45 and the Man of the Match was awarded to Boult who had figures of 10-3-27-5 in the first innings of the match. New Zealand also won the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy {{as a result of}} this win.|$|E
