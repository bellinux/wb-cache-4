5|$|Hirschman {{believed}} that Nurkse's balanced growth theory wasn't {{in fact a}} theory of growth. Growth implies the gradual transformation of an economy from one stage to the chronologically next stage. It entails the series of actions which leads the economy from a stage of infancy to that of maturity. However, the balanced growth theory involves {{the creation of a}} brand new, self-sufficient modern industrial economy being laid over a stagnant, self-sufficient traditional economy. Thus, there is no transformation. In reality, a dual economy <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> existence, where two separate economic sectors will begin to coexist in one country. They will differ on levels of development, technology and demand patterns. This may create inequality in the country.|$|E
5|$|Among harem-holding species, {{the adult}} females mate only with their harem stallion, while in other species, mating is more {{promiscuous}} and the males have larger testes for sperm competition. Estrous in female equines lasts 5–10 days; physical signs include frequent urination, flowing muscus, and a swollen, everted labia. In addition, estrous females will stand with their hind legs spread {{and raise their}} tails when {{in the presence of}} a male. Males assess the female's reproductive state with the flehmen response and the female will solicit mating by backing in. Length of gestation varies by species, it is roughly 11 to 13 months, and most mares <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> estrus again within a few days after foaling, depending on conditions. Usually, only a single foal is born, which is capable of running within an hour. Within a few weeks, foals will attempt to graze, but may continue to nurse for 8–13 months. Species in arid habitats, like the Grévy's zebra, have longer nursing intervals and do not drink water until they are three months old.|$|E

25|$|Anodizing is very {{resilient}} to weathering and corrosion, so it {{is commonly}} used for building facades and other areas where the surface <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> regular contact with the elements. While being resilient, it must be cleaned frequently. If left without cleaning, panel edge staining will naturally occur. Anodization is the process of converting an anode into cathode by bringing a more active anode in contact with it.|$|E

Yogananda abandoned his dream of founding a world-brotherhood colony in Encinitas and turned his mind to organizing the existing commununities along more strictly monastic lines.|$|E
25|$|Herd {{immunity}} (also called herd effect, community immunity, population immunity, {{or social}} immunity) {{is a form}} of indirect protection from infectious disease that occurs when a large percentage of a population has become immune to an infection, thereby providing a measure of protection for individuals who are not immune. In a population in which a large number of individuals are immune, chains of infection are likely to be disrupted, which stops or slows the spread of disease. The greater the proportion of individuals in a community who are immune, the smaller the probability that those who are not immune <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> contact with an infectious individual.|$|E
25|$|A {{vote on the}} Trident renewal {{programme}} {{was held}} in the House of Commons on 18 July 2016, and determined that the UK should proceed with construction of the next generation of submarines. The motion passed with a significant majority of 472 MPs voting in favour and 117 against. The MoD put the cost of building, testing and commissioning the replacement vessels at £31billion (plus a contingency fund of £10billion) over 35 years, or about 0.2percent of government spending, or 6percent of defence spending, every year. It is expected the new fleet of submarines <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> operation starting 2028 at the earliest and certainly by the 2030s. The Dreadnought class will extend the life of the Trident programme until at least the 2060s.|$|E
50|$|Consider, first, the {{observers}} in the lower-left and lower-right rooms. Each of these rooms has four walls. If the solution line starts {{in one of these}} rooms, its observer will see the line leave through a wall. Then it <b>will</b> <b>come</b> back <b>into</b> the room through another wall and leave again through a third. Finally, it <b>will</b> <b>come</b> back <b>into</b> the room through the fourth wall and end. If the solution line starts somewhere else, the observer will see the solution line <b>come</b> <b>into</b> and leave his room exactly twice, passing through all four walls in some order.

25|$|Urbanization {{might also}} force {{some people to}} live in slums when it {{influences}} land use by transforming agricultural land into urban areas and increases land value. During the process of urbanization, some agricultural land is used for additional urban activities. More investment <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> these areas, which increases the land value. Before some land is completely urbanized, there is a period when the land {{can be used for}} neither urban activities nor agriculture. The income from the land will decline, which decreases the people's incomes in that area. The gap between people's low income and the high land price forces some people to look for and construct cheap informal settlements, which are known as slums in urban areas. The transformation of agricultural land also provides surplus labor, as peasants have to seek jobs in urban areas as rural-urban migrant workers.|$|E
25|$|In {{externally}} decorated glassware the cadmium {{and lead}} content are limited, with lower concentrations permitted for the lip or rim region. Lead content is also restricted in ceramic ware with exterior decorations, booster cables, and safety pins in varying concentrations. In the case of safety pins the preliminary limit is 300ppm for 2012, but a much lower limit of 100 ppm <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> force in 2013. For the grips of hand tools the content of lead and certain phthalates are restricted. Various specific phthalates are also restricted in varying concentrations in notepads with vinyl coverings, purses, slippers, flip flops with rhinestones and similar plastic footwear, ear buds and headsets, and exercise/fitness mats. Restriction on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is defined for smoothing solution products, {{and in this case}} a specific warning is mandatory in the material safety data sheets if the product releases detectable amounts of formaldehyde.|$|E
25|$|In May 2011, Azerbaijan had {{discussed}} {{the purchase of}} long-range rockets from two Chinese companies, the minister of the defence industry has said. Other arms deals were signed with Turkey. Turkish Defence Minister Vecdi Gonul and Yaver Jamalov signed a protocol of intent on future joint production of two types of output – 107-mm rockets and the national rifle, possibly the Mehmetçik-1. A protocol of intent was signed the same day with the Mechanical and Chemical Industry Corporation MKEK on the joint production of 120-mm mortar launchers. This project <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>into</b> force {{in a few months}} time. Agreement has also been reached with Turkish company Aselsan on the production of some types of defence output in Azerbaijan, specifically the latest types of weapons' sights. These projects will probably happen in the near future too. Recently, Turkish defense industries secretariat told that an export version of the T-155 Firtina self-propelled howitser is almost done and could start production. T-155 has been powered by a German MTU power pack, which restricts the sale to some countries like Azerbaijan. The Turkish manufacturer MKEK, has announced that they have found an alternate supplier for the power pack where Azerbaijan showed interest to buy the high tech, more capable 155mm 52 caliber from Turkish authorities.|$|E
