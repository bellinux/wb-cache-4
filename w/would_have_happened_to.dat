Bill would join the basketball team, becoming a jock and leading to tension with the geeks. Daniel {{would end up in}} jail. Kim would become pregnant on tour while following the Grateful Dead.

Cunningham likened the Comet to the later Concorde, {{and added that}} he had assumed that the aircraft would change aviation, which it subsequently did. Aviation author Bill Withuhn concluded that the Comet had pushed [...] "'the state-of-the-art' beyond its limits." ...|$|E

500|$|In a {{surprising}} choice, former Maryland assistant coach and Citadel head coach Bobby Ross, {{who was not}} a big name at the time, was selected as head coach in 1982. In contrast to Claiborne's style, Ross implemented a high-powered offense. He replaced the I-veer triple option with an NFL-style offense that emphasized dropback passes, bootlegs, and play action passes. This change in tactics and strategy enabled starting quarterback Boomer Esiason the opportunity to excel to a degree not seen under Claiborne the season prior. Esiason said, [...] "Ross has an uncanny knack of putting players in a position to not only succeed, but to overachieve [...] [...] [...] If he didn't show up at Maryland, I don't know what <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> me. I don't know if I would have turned into the player I was and played in the NFL." [...] In the following years, several Maryland quarterbacks went on to careers in the National Football League (NFL), and the school was nicknamed [...] "Quarterback U" [...] as a result.|$|E
500|$|Wirkola said, [...] "I have {{a strong}} memory from my {{childhood}} of just how dark and gruesome their tale was and I wondered what <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> {{the two of them}} when they grew up? They had this dark past and this intense hatred of witches. So as I thought about it, it made sense to me that of course they would be fated to become great witch hunters. We wanted it to feel like this could be happening 300 years ago but at the same time, there is a modern spin on all the action, characters and weaponry. It was a fun way to make a classical world feel fresh." [...] Wirkola said that he originally came with that idea in 2007 while studying film and television at Bond University in Australia, when he wanted to make it as just a short film, and that the film school director Simon Hunter advised him: [...] "Tom, don't ever speak of the idea again until you are in front of a Hollywood producer and I guarantee you will sell it." ...|$|E
500|$|Another quandary {{is that if}} the precogs' visions are infallible {{then the}} future cannot be otherwise, while if they are {{incorrect}} people will be punished for crimes they will never commit. Kowalski contends that the precogs only attain knowledge of what he calls the [...] "conditional future". He cites as evidence two examples: the scene where Agatha steers Anderton through the mall by foreseeing dangerous events and helping him circumnavigate them, and a later scene where she tells Anderton and his ex-wife what <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> their child if he had lived. In the first example, Agatha knows what Anderton will freely choose to do when presented with specific facts so she provides them to him, and, in the second, she knows what will have happened to the Anderton's son based on specific scenarios throughout his life, in which she can see what he would have freely chosen to do, and what selections various people in his life would have freely made. According to Kowalski, the PreCrime unit therefore removes individuals from precise situations where they would freely choose to become a murderer.|$|E

2500|$|The – {{overwhelmingly}} negative – historical {{verdict on}} the battle was epitomized by the comment that the Portuguese [...] "ruined Ludendorff and saved their allies by running away"; whilst the German advance was superficially impressive, especially to begin with, it quickly lost momentum and stalled.

2500|$|The Tujunga Wash {{reached its}} peak flow on March 3, with a water flow of an {{estimated}} [...] Upper Big Tujunga Canyon was [...] "all but swept clean of structures that were not up above the flood line". In the San Fernando Valley, the floodwaters swept through many areas after escaping the normal channels of Tujunga Creek and its tributaries. Waters reached deep into the valley, flooding Van Nuys; five people died when the Lankershim Boulevard bridge collapsed at Universal City, just below the confluence of Tujunga Wash and the LA River. The flooding {{would have been much}} worse had a large debris flow not been halted at Big Tujunga Dam; Sam Browne, dam keeper during the 1938 flood, wrote that [...] "Large oak trees several hundred years old rushed down the canyon like kindling...

2500|$|Following his {{discovery}} by Leadbeater, Krishnamurti was nurtured by the Theosophical Society in Adyar. Leadbeater {{and a small}} number of trusted associates undertook the task of educating, protecting, and generally preparing Krishnamurti as the [...] "vehicle" [...] of the expected World Teacher. Krishnamurti (often later called Krishnaji) and his younger brother Nityananda (Nitya) were privately tutored at the Theosophical compound in Madras, and later exposed to a comparatively opulent life among a segment of European high society as they continued their education abroad. Despite his history of problems with schoolwork and concerns about his capacities and physical condition, the 14-year-old Krishnamurti was able to speak and write competently in English within six months. Lutyens says that later in life Krishnamurti came to view his [...] "discovery" [...] as a life-saving event. When he was asked in later life what he thought <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him if he had not been 'discovered' by Leadbeater he would unhesitatingly reply [...] "I would have died".|$|E
2500|$|The ongoing {{bond between}} the two series was {{eventually}} cut in 1986, as the tenth-season premiere of Dallas declared Bobby's death the previous year had been a dream. Bobby's death had had some influence on the Knots Landing storylines as well, with Gary grieving for his dead brother while Gary's wife Abby, who had lost her brother Sid a few years earlier, consoled him. Abby and Greg Sumner then took advantage of Gary's grief and Gary's journey to Dallas for Bobby's funeral to gain politically at Empire Valley. Val also named her and Gary's son [...] "Bobby" [...] in memory of his late Uncle. Unlike the Dallas producers, the Knots Landing producers were not prepared to reset their series, resulting in the Knots Landing producers cutting off their show's links with Dallas. As a result, there were no further crossover episodes or storylines. Bobby's return was simply never addressed on Knots Landing, nor was he mentioned again. Shackelford and Van Ark did however reprise their roles for the Dallas series finale in 1991, which showed what <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> their characters if J.R. had never existed.|$|E

In place of exit signals, 'stop' boards were provided {{at the end of}} the platform. In absence of any other signal, all trains were obliged to stop at the board to await instructions; the dispatcher, however, could show a green hand lamp to an approaching train, which allowed its crew to ignore the stop board.

2500|$|In late July 1976, the Socialist Burmese {{government}} announced {{in newspapers and}} on state radio that Kyaw Zaw's, son Aung Kyaw Zaw and daughter Dr. Hla Kyaw Zaw had disappeared {{from their homes and}} requested the public's assistance in finding them. Within several days on August 10, 1976 the clandestine Communist Party of Burma (CPB) radio station [...] based at that time in Kunming, China, announced that [...] "former Brigadier Kyaw Zaw has arrived in the liberated area" [...] i.e. the areas {{under the control of the}} CPB. The same day Kyaw Zaw broadcast an appeal on CPB radio to the people and especially requested [...] the Burmese Army personnel to join the CPB and [...] "the mainstream of the People's Democratic Forces". Among others, in his appeal to the Burmese Army personnel, Kyaw Zaw stated that he was one of the founding members of the Burmese Army. He rhetorically asked the troops what <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the Army and [...] the country if he had, like Ne Win, then President and long-time dictator of Burma, [...] "acted and cavorted like a feudal play-boy prince". He also revealed for the first time that Aung San and others among the Thirty Comrades had once seriously considered removing Ne Win from the military as he had shown [...] "fascist" [...] tendencies under the Japanese. Kyaw Zaw stated that the plan of Aung San and other leaders to remove Ne Win from the military was unsuccessful due to Ne Win's [...] "cunning" [...] (kauk-kyit hmu), pleasing both sides (hna-phet myet hnar loke-hmu) and the conditions pertaining at that time i.e. during the war and immediate post-war years. Kyaw Zaw claimed that the unsuccessful and ostensible attempts to remove Ne Win from commanding [...] the Burmese [...] military was a [...] "historical lesson". He exhorted the government troops not to continue [...] as assassins and murderers in the service [...] of the [...] "power-mad and evil king ( [...] min-hsoe min-nyit) Ne Win". Kyaw Zaw stated that [...] the [...] "most important aspects of the Army's history such as the Resistance against the Japanese March to May 1945 and the immediate post-war years were co-terminous with my personal life". Giving the [...] examples of China and [...] "what had happened only very recently in Indochina (i.e the Communist victories in Kampuchea, Vietnam and Laos in April and December 1975)" [...] he requested the Army personnel not to be hesitant to [...] "join the armed revolution led by the Communist Party of Burma".|$|E
