25|$|In {{the role}} of the state personified, the monarch has <b>worn</b> <b>clothing</b> {{symbolic}} of the country and his or her distinct role in it. For instance, the gown worn by Queen Elizabeth II at both her coronation in London and the opening of the Canadian parliament in 1957 was decorated with the floral emblems of her realms, including maple leaves for Canada. During the same 1957 visit to Ottawa, the Queen also wore to a banquet held at Rideau Hall the Maple-Leaf-of-Canada dress; it was a pale green satin gown, edged with a garland consisting of deep green velvet maple leaves appliquéd with crysals and emeralds. Afterwards, the dress was donated to the Crown Collection and is now held at the Canadian Museum of History. Similarly, for a dinner held in July 2010 in Toronto, Elizabeth wore a white gown with silver maple leaves appliquéd on the right sleeve and shoulder.|$|E

5000|$|Patchwork {{enjoyed a}} {{widespread}} revival during the Great Depression {{as a way}} to recycle <b>worn</b> <b>clothing</b> into warm quilts. Even very small and worn pieces of material are suitable for use in patchwork, although crafters today more often use new 100% cotton fabrics as the basis for their designs. In the US, patchwork declined after World War II, but was again revived during the American bicentennial. In the past, hand quilting was often done in a group around a frame. Instead of quilting, the layers are sometimes tied together at regular intervals with pieces of yarn, a practice known as tying or knotting, and which produces a [...] "comforter".|$|E

50|$|Compared to road vehicles, trains have a {{much greater}} {{stopping}} distance at the same speed, but often travel much faster than road vehicles. Unlike road vehicles, they cannot swerve {{out of the way}} of obstructions. Trains cannot be relied upon to stop for rail workers. Hence it is the duty of the track worker to remain or retire to a safe location on the approach of a train. It is important that a lookout is kept (often working as a team). In order that trains can indicate their presence to workers, orange high visibility clothing must be <b>worn.</b> <b>Clothing</b> that is yellow, green or red is disallowed because those colours are the colours of signal flags.|$|E
50|$|Rashes due to grass allergies are {{not entirely}} uncommon. Other allergies may occur as well, {{but this is no}} {{different}} from most other breeds of dogs. Due to their lack of hair, they may need protection from the sun (based on the season, their geographic location and the individual dog's degree of pigmentation or lack thereof). If needed, sunscreen can be applied or a light shirt may be <b>worn.</b> <b>Clothing</b> is oftentimes used, not only for the protection from the sun but from the cold as well (where the climate warrants). It is, however, important to keep the skin clean with regular, possibly daily depending on application of sunscreen or moisturizers, bathing with gentle soap to prevent infections in the skin pores (acne).|$|E
5000|$|The casual {{subculture}} is a subsection {{of association}} football {{culture that is}} typified by football hooliganism and the wearing of expensive designer clothing (known as [...] "clobber"). The subculture originated in the United Kingdom in the early 1980s when many hooligans started wearing designer clothing labels and expensive sportswear such as Stone Island, CP Company, L'alpina, Lacoste, Sergio Tacchini, Fila and Ellesse {{in order to avoid}} the attention of police and to intimidate rivals. They did not wear club colours, so it was allegedly easier to infiltrate rival groups and to enter pubs. Some casuals have <b>worn</b> <b>clothing</b> items similar to those worn by mods. Casuals have been portrayed in films and television programmes such as ID, The Firm and The Football Factory.|$|E

5000|$|In 1986, Boltanski began {{creating}} mixed media/materials installations {{with light}} as essential concept.

While creating Reserve (exhibition at Basel, Museum Gegenwartskunst, 1989), Boltanski filled rooms and corridors with <b>worn</b> <b>clothing</b> items {{as a way of}} inciting profound sensation of human tragedy at concentration camps. As in his previous works, objects serve as relentless reminders of human experience and suffering.

50|$|The {{materials}} {{used to create}} caftans varied according to status and wealth. They ranged anywhere from silk, brocade, cotton, and valuable furs for richer groups, to leather, wool, and felt for those less well off. Season also dictated the type of fabric worn, especially for those that could afford it. In the summer, Middle Eastern silk and brocades were favored whereas in the winter furs were used to add additional warmth. During the Mongol Empire, people {{did not believe in}} washing their clothes, or themselves. They refrained from doing this because it was their belief that by washing, they would pollute the water and anger the dragons that controlled the water cycle. Therefore, clothes were often not changed until they fell off or fell apart, except for holidays when specialized robes were worn. Because of this, the smell of the outfit was seen as an important aspect of the wearer. For example, if the Great Khan were to give his previously <b>worn</b> <b>clothing</b> (with his smell on it) to a loyal subject, it would be considered a great honor to have not only the clothing, but the smell as well.|$|E
