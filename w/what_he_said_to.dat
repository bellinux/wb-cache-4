Groening joked the film [...] "posit {{the existence of a}} very active God", when asked if he believed it was likely to offend. Mark I. Pinsky, author of The Gospel According to The Simpsons, said the film [...] "treats genuine faith with respect, while keeping a sharp eye out for religious pretension and hypocrisy of all kinds". Regarding the scene where the tenants of Moe's Tavern and the Church switch locations, he believed it took the [...] "chance to unmask everyone's human fallibility." [...] In analyzing the role of Ned Flanders, he wrote, [...] "It is [...] willingness of The Simpsons to depict all the different sides of us [...] that makes it so rich and funny on our complicated relationship with religion." [...] Trees are a motif in the film, and they were implemented in every important or emotional scene throughout the film. The animators inserted an apple tree behind Lisa and Colin during their initial meeting, a reference to the biblical figures of Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden.|$|E
500|$|The Benton {{proposal}} {{was intended to}} calm northern anti-slavery Democrats (who wished to eliminate the Tyler-Calhoun treaty altogether, {{as it had been}} negotiated on behalf of the slavery expansionists), and allow the decision to devolve upon the soon-to-be-inaugurated Democratic President-elect James K. Polk. President-elect Polk had expressed his ardent wish that Texas annexation should be accomplished before he entered Washington in advance of his inauguration on March 4, 1845, the same day Congress would end its session. With his arrival in the capital, he discovered the Benton and Brown factions in the Senate [...] "paralyzed" [...] over the Texas annexation legislation. On the advice of his soon-to-be Secretary of the Treasury Robert J. Walker, Polk urged Senate Democrats to unite under a dual resolution that would include both the Benton and Brown versions of annexation, leaving enactment of the legislation to Polk's discretion when he took office. In private and separate talks with supporters of both the Brown and Benton plans, Polk left each side with the [...] "impression he would administer their [...] policy. Polk meant <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> Southerners and meant to appear friendly to the Van Burenite faction." [...] Polk's handling of the matter had the effect of uniting Senate northern Democrats in favor of the dual alternative treaty bill.|$|E
2500|$|The authorship of the Old English Orosius is unknown. In the 12th century William of Malmesbury {{believed}} that it was the work of King Alfred himself, but scholarly scrutiny of the text since the mid-20th century, including by the historians Dorothy Whitelock and Janet Bately, has led to this view being refuted on lexical and syntactic grounds. Janet Bately believes that the Old English version of Orosius was created between 889 and 899, probably in the early 890s, but {{there is no way of}} knowing whether Ohthere's account was previously in existence and incorporated from the outset, or if it was written down later and incorporated into a subsequent copy. The events that Ohthere described may have taken place at any time from the 870s to the late 890s, and Ohthere's account is given in the form of a third-person report of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> King Alfred, rather than as reported speech, as exemplified by the opening sentence: [...] "Ohthere sæde his hlaforde Ælfrede kynincge þæt he ealra Norðmanna norðmest bude." [...] ("Ohthere told his lord Alfred king that he lived northmost of all Norwegians.") Dorothy Whitelock wrote that [...] "Ohthere's account reads like a set of replies to questions put to him." ...|$|E

He told the BBC, “ acted with complete probity and integrity throughout my parliamentary career”. He was exonerated by the Commissioner in September 2015 after a detailed investigation. The Commissioner for Standards dismissed all allegations that he had brought the House of Commons into disrepute, saying that [...] "I have seen nothing which suggests that [...] conduct would have merited criticism if the approach made by PMR [...] had been genuine.” [...] She said that [...] "the evidence I have seen supports Mr Straw's assertions that he [...] "neither exaggerated nor boasted" [...] in <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> the reporters." [...] The Commissioner was sharply critical of Channel 4 and the Daily Telegraph, saying [...] "if in their coverage of this story, the reporters for [...] Dispatches, and the Daily Telegraph had accurately reported what was said by these two members [...] in their interviews and measured their words against {{the rules of the}} House it would have been possible to avoid the damage that has been done to the lives of these two individuals and those around them and to the reputation of the House." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 56, {{he married}} Li Shuxian, a {{hospital}} nurse, on 30 April 1962, in a ceremony held at the Banquet Hall of the Consultative Conference. From 1964 until his death he worked as an editor for the literary department of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, where his monthly salary was around 100 yuan. One yuan in the 1960s was equivalent to about 40 cents USD. Li recalled in a 1995 interview that: [...] "I found Pu Yi a honest man, a man who desperately needed my love {{and was ready to}} give me as much love as he could. When I was having even a slight case of flu, he was so worried I would die, that he refused to sleep at night and sat by my bedside until dawn so he could attend to my needs". Li also noted like everybody else who knew him that Puyi was an incredibly clumsy man, leading her to say: [...] "Once in a boiling rage at his clumsiness, I threatened to divorce him. On hearing this, he got down on his knees and, with tears in his eyes, he begged me to forgive him. I shall never forget <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> me: 'I have nothing in this world except you, and you are my life. If you go, I will die'. But apart from him, what did I ever have in the world?".|$|E
2500|$|Nick Bond of News.com.au {{described}} Dicko's {{criticism of}} Paulini's gold dress as [...] "one {{of the most}} controversial moments in Australian Idol history," [...] while Andrew Bucklow from the same publication labelled it one of the show's [...] "most infamous moments" [...] ever. During Dicko's appearance on The Celebrity Apprentice Australia in 2012, he revealed that [...] "people were virtually spitting on me" [...] after that Australian Idol episode had aired, calling it a defining moment for him because he [...] "became a national pariah" [...] overnight. In an episode of The Celebrity Apprentice and in reference to the gold dress controversy, Dicko made a statue of someone wearing a gold dress with the word [...] "sorry" [...] printed on it. Paulini appeared in the episode to see what Dicko had made and she accepted his apology. In 2014, Dicko told Woman's Day that he does not regret <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> Paulini, saying [...] "It’s part of who I am and who Paulini is and it binds us together." [...] In July 2017, Dicko apologised again in a pre-recorded message he left for Paulini during her radio interview on Hot 91.1 FM's breakfast show, Dave, Sam & Ash. In the message, Dicko said [...] "I was trying to be nice at the time, can you believe, but I'm glad that you've gone on to do such great things." [...] After joking that his [...] "cruel little words" [...] turned them [...] "into Australian reality TV's power couple", he ended his message by telling Paulini, [...] "what I want to say is, I'm so proud of you girl, you go get'em." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 24 August 2008, Georgian {{president}} Mikheil Saakashvili had {{a lengthy}} televised speech. He remembered that after 2004 Adjara crisis he phoned President Putin and thanked him. [...] "I remember that conversation very well; {{in response to}} my polite remarks, he said roughly: ‘Now remember, in Adjara we did not intervene, but you won’t have any gifts from us in South Ossetia or Abkhazia.’ That’s <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> me." [...] He then said [...] "I suppose that Russia started thinking about military intervention in Georgia sometime in 2007." [...] " [...] Russia announced a withdrawal from the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, limiting military forces in [...] and the Caucasus." [...] Saakashvili then slammed the EU’s reaction to Russia’s admission of violating Georgian airspace in July 2008. [...] "This admission by Russia was a clear sign that they were testing western reaction," [...] he stated. Saakashvili said that {{his first meeting with}} Medvedev in June 2008 in St. Petersburg was good; while at the next meeting with Medvedev in Astana in July 2008, the Russian president’s stance was changed and [...] "it was clear that they [...] were preparing for something bad." [...] Saakashvili said that Georgia had expected a Russian attack from Abkhazia, rather than from South Ossetia, so major forces of the Georgian army were deployed in the Georgia's west. He said that as the situation deteriorated on 7 August, [...] "we moved one brigade [...] closer to South Ossetia, and later another [...] as well." [...] "But our major forces were still deployed in the west; there was a brigade at Senaki [...] and we did not call back our brigade from Iraq, because I was deeply convinced up to the last minute that Russia would not engage in such a large-scale provocation," [...] he said. [...] "Although we were under fire from 120mm mortar launchers, I announced a unilateral ceasefire; at that time we already had one dead soldier in the village of Avnevi and four others were wounded; [...] Kezerashvili was begging me to let him open artillery fire, because, he was telling me, otherwise he was unable to bring [...] from [...] But my response was that we could not open fire whatever happened," [...] he said. Saakashvili also said that the Russian army had moved into South Ossetia before the war had even started. [...] "When we ask our western partners: didn't you see them coming, they respond that their satellites were directed mainly on Iraq and that they could not fly over , but it was impossible {{to see what was happening}} on the ground because it was cloudy. So it was a serious failure of international intelligence services; they would not have hidden this information from us, if they had known it; but they also did not know it," [...] Saakashvili said.|$|E
