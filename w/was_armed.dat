5|$|An {{intelligence}} official told Seymour Hersh in 2015 that no fire-fight took place. In the earlier versions, Al-Kuwaiti {{is said to}} have opened fire on the first team of SEALs with an AK-47 from behind the guesthouse door, lightly injuring a SEAL with bullet fragments. A short firefight took place between al-Kuwaiti and the SEALs, in which al-Kuwaiti was killed. His wife Mariam was allegedly shot and wounded in the right shoulder. The courier's male relative Abrar was then said to have been shot and killed by the SEALs' second team {{on the first floor of}} the main house as shots had already been fired and the SEALs thought that he <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> with a loaded AK-47 (this was later confirmed to be true in the official report). A woman near him, later identified as Abrar's wife Bushra, was in this version also shot and killed. Bin Laden's young adult son {{is said to have}} encountered the SEALs on the staircase of the main house, and to have been shot and killed by the second team. An unnamed U.S. senior defense official stated that only one of the five people killed, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, <b>was</b> <b>armed.</b> The interior of the house was pitch dark, because CIA operatives had cut the power to the neighborhood. However, the SEALs wore night vision goggles.|$|E
5|$|Between 1934 and the mid-1940s, several {{variants}} of the Panzer I were designed, {{especially during the}} later years of its combat history. Because they were obsolescent from their introduction, incapable of defeating foreign armor, and outclassed by newer German tanks, the PanzerI chassis were increasingly adapted as tank destroyers and other variants. One of the best-known variants was the kleiner Panzerbefehlswagen ("small armoured command vehicle"), built on the Ausf. A and Ausf. B chassis—200 of these were manufactured. The Panzer I Ausf. B chassis was also used to build the German Army's first tracked tank destroyer, the Panzerjäger I. This vehicle <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> with a Czech 47-millimeter (1.85in) anti-tank gun.|$|E
5|$|Born into {{an impoverished}} {{family in the}} Šumadija region of Ottoman Serbia, Karađorđe {{distinguished}} himself during the Austro-Turkish War of 1788–1791 {{as a member of}} the Serbian Free Corps, a militia made up of Habsburg and Ottoman Serbs that <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> and trained by the Austrians. Fearing retribution following the Austrians' and Serb rebels' defeat in 1791, he and his family fled to the Austrian Empire, where they were to live until 1794, when a general amnesty was declared. Karađorđe subsequently returned to Šumadija and became a livestock merchant. In 1796, the rogue governor of the Sanjak of Vidin, Osman Pazvantoğlu, invaded the Pashalik of Belgrade, and Karađorđe fought alongside the Ottomans to quash the incursion.|$|E

Baris Presi is common throughout {{northern and southern}} Bali. Baris Dadap, however, was limited in range by the 1980s. Dancers are not accompanied by an orchestra, but sing songs regarding wayang during performances; this dance is generally performed during cremation ceremonies or temple festivals (dewayadnya).|$|R
50|$|The Type 093 <b>is</b> <b>armed</b> {{with six}} torpedo tubes; reports {{conflict}} on whether these are 553 mm or 650 mm tubes. The Type 093 {{has been said}} to <b>be</b> <b>armed</b> with the YJ-12 or YJ-82 anti-ship missiles. Anti-ship cruise missiles may also be future options.|$|R
5|$|Enterprise <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> {{with two}} 100-pounder smoothbore, muzzle-loading Somerset cannon and two rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns. The breech-loading guns {{were of a}} new design from Armstrong and much was hoped for them. Firing tests carried out in September 1861 against an {{armoured}} target, however, proved that the 110-pounder was inferior to the 68-pounder smoothbore gun in armour penetration, and repeated incidents of breech explosions during the Battles for Shimonoseki and the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863–64 caused the navy to withdraw the guns from service shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|HMS Ramillies was a Royal Sovereign-class pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} of the Royal Navy, {{named after}} the Battle of Ramillies. The ship was built by J. & G.

5|$|In the {{original}} Final Fight, Poison and Roxy both utilized standing and acrobatic flip kicks {{to attack the}} player. As one of the fighters in Final Fight Revenge, her moveset was expanded heavily, and she <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> with a whip. The whip is used primarily in her Cat Claw and Thunder Whip attacks (which are comparable to Shoryuken/Shinryūken styled attacks, respectively), {{and can be used}} to steal a weapon from the opponent.

5|$|Later, {{the design}} was further {{modified}} to the Do 17 Z-10 Kauz II, the solid nose now containing an infra-red searchlight for the Spanner Anlage infrared detection system. The infrared lamp {{in the nose}} was used to illuminate the target while the display unit in the windshield made the reflection visible to the target. The Z-10 <b>was</b> <b>armed</b> with four 7.92mm (.312in) MG 17 machine guns grouped above the IR light and two 20mm MG FF in the lower nose. The crew could reload the 20mm cannons' drum magazines internally. The Z-10 contained an IR searchlight (Spanner-Anlage) for the Spanner infrared detection system. A single Kauz II was equipped with and tested the Lichtenstein radar.|$|E
