25|$|We {{can have}} an idea {{of the quality of the}} {{university}} in what were seeing <b>what</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his professors. Among the most famous, who are many, just to cite Estius (1542–1613), the famous commentator of the epistles of Paul. After classical studies at Utrecht, he then spent two decades in Leuven, studying philosophy, theology and Scripture and in 1580 he received the degree of doctor of theology. In 1582 he became professor of theology at Douai, a position he held for thirty-one years, and he joined her in the last eighteen years of his life with that of Chancellor of the university, while also being the many years rector of the diocesan seminary. The works of Estius were written in Latin and for the most part, their publications were posthumous. Note also Lessius Leonardus (1554–1623), professing the philosophy, and Francois du Bois, said Franciscus Sylvius (1581–1649) , professor of theology and vice-chancellor of the university, but also Nemius Gaspard Dubois, George Colveneere, and Philippe Bossuet Cospéan which involved in the controversy of Douai.|$|E
500|$|Crawford {{sees the}} {{events at the}} 1913 Derby as a lens [...] "through which... whole life has been interpreted", and the {{uncertainty}} of her motives and intentions that day has affected how she has been judged by history. Carolyn Collette, a literary critic who has studied Davison's writing, identifies the different motives ascribed to Davison, including [...] "uncontrolled impulses" [...] or a search for martyrdom for women's suffrage. Collette also sees a more current trend among historians [...] "to accept <b>what</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> her close contemporaries believed: that Davison's actions that day were deliberate" [...] and that she attempted to attach the suffragette colours to the King's horse. Cicely Hale, a suffragette {{who worked at the}} WSPU and who knew Davison, described her as [...] "a fanatic" [...] who was prepared to die but did not mean to. Other observers, such as Purvis, and Ann Morley and Liz Stanley—Davison's biographers—agree that Davison did not mean to die.|$|E
500|$|The main {{theme of}} obZen is [...] "human evil", {{according}} to Haake. The title is {{a play on}} the words [...] "obscene" [...] and [...] "Zen"; in addition, [...] "ob" [...] means [...] "anti" [...] in Latin. Therefore, the title suggests that the human species has found harmony and balance in warfare and bloodshed. Revolver Magazine finds the lyrics of the title track from obZen representative of the entire album: [...] "Salvation found in vomit and blood/Where depravation, lies, corruption/War and pain is god." [...] However, Haake claims, [...] "We don't dwell on hate and bad feelings as people. But with these songs, I think {{we really wanted to}} paint a picture lyrically that might be seen as a cautionary tale. We're going, 'Heads up. Here's <b>what</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the parts of being human are about, {{and this is what we}} can be at our worst.' So it's more about being aware of negative feelings than actually living them all the time." ...|$|E

500|$|Rand's {{first major}} {{success as a}} writer came in 1943 with The Fountainhead, a romantic and {{philosophical}} novel that she wrote {{over a period of}} seven years. The novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named Howard Roark and his struggle against what Rand described as [...] "second-handers"—those who attempt to live through others, placing others above themselves. It was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the Bobbs-Merrill Company on the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden, who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it. While completing the novel, Rand was prescribed the amphetamine Benzedrine to fight fatigue. The drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the novel, but afterwards she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks' rest. Her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to <b>what</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> her later associates described as volatile mood swings.|$|E
500|$|To Stanford's regret, many of {{his pupils}} who {{achieved}} eminence as composers broke away from his classical, Brahmsian precepts, as he had himself rebelled against Reinecke's conservatism. The composer George Dyson wrote, [...] "In a certain sense the very rebellion he fought was the most obvious fruit of his methods. And in view of <b>what</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> these rebels have since achieved, {{one is tempted to}} wonder whether there is really anything better a teacher can do for his pupils than drive them into various forms of revolution." [...] The works of some of Stanford's pupils, including Holst and Vaughan Williams, entered the general repertory in Britain, and to some extent elsewhere, as Stanford's never did. For many years after his death it seemed that Stanford's greatest fame would be as a teacher. Among his achievements at the RCM was the establishment of an opera class, with at least one operatic production every year. From 1885 to 1915 there were 32 productions, all of them conducted by Stanford.|$|E

500|$|Hamilton {{accepted}} {{responsibility for}} his near stall on the grid: [...] "I hadn't hit the switch early enough and therefore we {{were not in the}} launch map and went straight into anti-stall, and when everyone else was in their launch mode, I wasn't." [...] Renault dismissed suggestions that Alonso had brake tested Hamilton in the incident that led to the McLaren's wing breaking off. Pat Symonds, Renault's head of engineering, said his team's telemetry indicated Alonso was on full throttle down the straight, and had not touched the brakes: [...] "I think all I can say from our side {{is that there is no}} blame attributable to Fernando, which is <b>what</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the speculation might be." [...] McLaren F1 CEO Martin Whitmarsh said that Hamilton's front wing had broken seconds before the impact, and that the resulting downforce reduction had sucked Hamilton into Alonso's slipstream faster than expected. However, photos indicate that the front wing on the McLaren could have broken even earlier when Hamilton nudged a car (believed to be Alonso) on the opening lap. The later incident left Alonso with damage to the back of the car, impairing his attempts to pass Glock late in the race.|$|E
500|$|The {{extent to}} which money or {{patronage}} affected {{the outcome of the}} election is unclear. Congressman Burton stated, [...] "I never saw any evidence of the use of money in Columbus and don't believe that any money was used corruptly." [...] In an interview after Hanna's death, James Rudolph Garfield, son of the late president and floor leader of the Hanna forces in the Ohio Senate, recalled that the senator [...] "had been asked to shut his eyes to some things. But he declined to do it." [...] However, Garfield also noted, [...] "I have never been sure as to <b>what</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the men who called themselves Senator Hanna's friends really did do." [...] Croly believed that Hanna did not personally authorize bribes of legislators, but concedes that Hanna's supporters [...] "may have been willing to spend money in Mr. Hanna's interest and without his knowledge." [...] The biographer suggested, [...] "If Mr. Hanna had himself planned to purchase the vote of John C. Otis, it is reasonable to believe that the business would have been better managed." [...] Horner believes it impossible to ascertain if corruption took place, but if Hanna bribed legislators, it was because it was a common practice on both sides. He notes of Hanna, [...] "his career as a senator continued, but accusations of wrongdoing remain a part of his legacy well over a century later." [...] Public dismay at what was seen as a corrupt means of choosing federal lawmakers was {{a major factor in the}} ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1913, which took the privilege of electing senators out of state legislators' hands and gave it to the people.|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{physiologic}} and endocrinologic {{basis of}} fetal {{development is a}} major goal of perinatal biology. During the past decade a number of technological developments have allowed more precise evaluation of the fetus in utero and diagnosis of abnormalities.

[...] Its bas-reliefs, later additions of Jayavarman VIII, are {{in stark contrast to}} those of the outer: rather than set-piece battles and processions, the smaller canvases offered by the inner gallery are decorated for the most part with scenes from Hindu mythology. Some of the figures depicted are Siva, Vishnu, and Brahma, the members of the trimurti or threefold godhead of Hinduism, Apsaras or celestial dancers, Ravana and Garuda. [...] There is however no certainty as to <b>what</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the panels depict, or as to their relationship with one another. [...] One gallery just north of the eastern gopura, for example, shows two linked scenes which have been explained as the freeing of a goddess from inside a mountain, or as an act of iconoclasm by Cham invaders. Another series of panels shows a king fighting a gigantic serpent with his bare hands, then having his hands examined by women, and finally lying ill in bed; these images have been connected with the legend of the Leper King, who contracted leprosy from the venom of a serpent with whom he had done battle. [...] Less obscure are depictions of the construction of a Vishnuite temple (south of the western gopura) and the Churning of the Sea of Milk (north of the western gopura).|$|E
2500|$|In the 2000s, {{the temple}} {{began to focus}} more on {{promoting}} an ethical lifestyle, using the five and eight precepts as a foundation. Nationwide people were encouraged to quit drinking and smoking through a campaign called The Lao Phao Buri ( [...] , literally: 'throw away alcohol and burn cigarettes'), cooperating with other religious traditions. This project led the World Health Organization (WHO) to present a World No Tobacco Day award to Luang Por Dhammajayo on 31 May 2004. Over two hundred The Lao Phao Buri ceremonies were held, involving literally the pouring away of alcoholic beverages and the burning of cigarettes. The ceremonies were later to become a model of practice in schools and government institutions. The temple's campaign was carried to new heights when in 2005 the beverage company Thai Beverage announced to publicly list in the Stock Exchange of Thailand, which would be the biggest listing in Thai history. Despite attempts by the National Office of Buddhism (a government agency) to prohibit monks from protesting, two thousand monks of the temple organized a chanting of Buddhist texts in front of the Stock Exchange to pressurize them to decline Thai Beverage's initial public offering. In an unprecedented cooperative effort, the temple was soon followed suit by former Black May revolt leader Chamlong Srimuang and the Santi Asoke movement, holding their protest as well. Subsequently, another 122 religious and social organizations joined, belonging to several religions. The organizations officially asked Prime Minister Thaksin's cooperation to stop the company, in <b>what</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the protest leaders described as [...] "a grave threat to the health and culture" [...] of Thai society. While the Stock Exchange pointed out the economical benefits of this first local listing, opponents referred to rising alcohol abuse in Thai society, ranking fifth in alcohol consumption. Ultimately, the protests led to an indefinite postponement of the listing by the Stock Exchange, as Thai Beverage chose to list in Singapore instead, and the Stock Exchange chief resigned because of the loss of profit.|$|E
