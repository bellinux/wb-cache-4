5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Machination's attempted takeover, Sunstreaker and Hunter are successfully separated by Ratchet. Hunter has a happy reunion with Verity and Jimmy, but Sunstreaker, angry over <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> to him, abandons his former partner. After the initial battles on Earth, the Decepticons lie low, experimenting with creating new life and eventually creating the Insecticons {{to take advantage of a}} now captured Hunter, as well as thousands of failed experiments eventually dubbed the Swarm. As the Autobots have reinforced their position on Earth, the Decepticons lure them into a trap by planting disinformation about a Decepticon trap with the help of Sunstreaker, who is convinced that he is in fact helping Starscream kill Megatron. His motives are darker than merely helping the Autobots win by disposing of Megatron - he asks the Decepticon to kill all the humans in revenge for what was done to him. Armed with the disillusioned Autobot's knowledge, unified and with their new weapon - Devastator - the Decepticons decimate the Autobots. Planning to dispose of them through a portal to Cybertron, Prime manages to fight them off long enough for his troops to escape through the portal, though at great cost - Prime is heavily damaged and rendered comatose by the damage he takes, and the Autobots are marooned on Cybertron.|$|E

New knowledge, when to any purpose, must come by contemplation of old knowledge, in every matter which concerns thought; mechanical contrivance sometimes, not very often, escapes this rule.

Bolkovac responded, [...] "Unfortunately, the widespread horror is already there. This {{is not going to}} be simple or a quick fix." [...] She said that in addition to Bosnia, peacekeepers had violated human rights in Nigeria, Kosovo, Burundi, Sierra Leone, the Congo, Liberia, Cambodia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti, Colombia, Guinea and Sudan. Kondracki added that while she wanted to be optimistic and hoped that the screening would [...] "lead to genuine discussion and thought about the UN's involvement in sex trafficking and other crimes", she worried that it might not have the desired lasting impact: [...] "I know we are going to hear a lot about <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> since the time depicted in this film, but rhetoric only goes so far. The situation has escalated." [...] Following the theatrical release of The Whistleblower, The Guardian reported that other UN officials attempted to downplay the events depicted and that initiatives against trafficking in Bosnia were aborted.|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally {{subsistence}} {{consisted of}} farming with hunting and gathering. The first external commerce was the growing of coffee beans, {{with this and}} latter selling of various handcrafts done through intermediaries to the outside world. One reason for this was that few in the town spoke Spanish. Today, amate paper production is the main economic activity.

[...] Another important craft is called “chaquira,” intricate beadwork based on <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> on the traditional blouses of women.

2500|$|In 2008 the {{government}} announced plans to [...] "privatize" [...] SWCC by transforming it in a holding company. The holding company would initially supervise affiliated production firms that would run the desalination plants. Subsequently it would sell off the firms and include {{the private sector in}} a way similar to <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> with the Independent Water and Power Projects (see below). The first plant to be privatized would be in Yanbu. However, the plans have been modified in 2010: The old plants continue to be operated by SWCC, while new plants are built and operated by the private sector. In June 2016, amid low oil prices, it was decided to revive the initial privatization plan. Water minister Abdulrahman Al-Fadhli and SWCC governor Abdulrahman Al-Ibrahim said that the company will become a holding company, served by local production units. Privatisation will be in two stages: first, investment partners for the desalination plants ("production units") will be sought; then shares of the holding company will be sold on the Saudi stock market. Around SAR110 billion ($29.3 billion) funding for investment will be needed by SWCC over the next 15 years.|$|E
2500|$|Smith's various projects, {{starting}} with a mortgage taken to purchase his estate at Tucking Mill in Somerset in 1798, accrued financial commitments that ran {{into a series of}} difficulties which he managed to withstand by borrowing money from sympathetic creditors and mortgagors and funding repayments by taking on a relentless schedule of work commissions between 1801 and 1819. However a project to quarry Bath Stone near his property, for sale to the London property development market, failed to return the significant investment it had required due to poor quality stone and Smith found himself in default to co-investor Charles Conolly. [...] Smith had used his Bath estate as security against Conolly's loan but there was excess to pay. In attempting to stave off his debt Smith sold his 'fossil collection' to the British Museum for £700, but this proved insufficient and funds fell short of the sum owed to Conolly by £300 and as a consequence Smith was sent to debtor's prison in 1819. Through all this financial turmoil, Smith managed to publish his map and subsequent associated publications but in 1817 he remarked [...] "My income is as yet not anywise improved by <b>what</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>done,</b> the profits being required to liquidate the debt incurred by publication." ...|$|E
