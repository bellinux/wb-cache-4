5|$|Despite {{his lack}} of {{performance}} in the Tests, Davidson showed his potential with consistent performance throughout the tour. He compiled 944runs at 41.04 during the tour and amassed five half centuries and a century. He scored three fifties {{in the last month}} of the tour, and after missing his maiden first-class century with 95 against Lancashire, he broke through with 104* against Somerset at County Ground, Taunton. He also took 50 wickets at 20.96 <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> Davidson was steady <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> never taking more than three wickets in an innings. He ranked seventh among the Australians in both run-scoring and wicket-taking.|$|E

5|$|Allen was {{unsuccessful}} in the Gentlemen v Players game, but performed effectively <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> for Middlesex. He continued to struggle when batting, and his highest innings {{of the year}} was 77 runs scored in the end-of-season Scarborough Festival. In total, he scored 281 runs at 17.56 and took 42 wickets at 22.19. He was not invited on the MCC tour of South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Of the First Test team, all bar Toshack scored {{multiple}} first-class {{centuries in}} their careers, and all averaged under 27.50 <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> As Bradman wanted all four spin techniques covered, {{as well as}} both left and right-arm seamers, this also meant that he could only have two fast bowlersLindwall and Milleras three positions were occupied by spinners and a fourth by Toshack, who was of medium pace.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Lawton (6 October 1919– 6 November 1996) was an English {{football}} player and manager. A strong centre-forward with excellent all-round attacking skills, {{he was able}} to head <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> with tremendous power and accuracy. Despite losing much of his best years to World War II, he scored 260 goals in 433 league and cup competitions in 14 full seasons in the Football League.|$|E

5|$|After his Test debut, Hunt was {{expected}} to be the Queensland fullback in the first match of the three game State of Origin series. However, Queensland selectors decided to stay with incumbent Origin fullback Matt Bowen. The selectors reconsidered after Queensland lost the first game, selecting Hunt for the second match. In his State of Origin debut, Hunt ran <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> seventeen times, making 196 metres. He missed the third Origin game because of a foot injury, sustained in the Broncos' Round 15 match, and was replaced by Clinton Schifcofske.|$|E
5|$|An all-rounder with a {{moderate}} first class record (averaging 32 with the bat and 40 <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball),</b> Cowdrey's debut as {{captain in the}} Fourth Test at Headingley was a disaster. He scored 0 and 5 and took no wickets, as England were crushed by 10 wickets, West Indies again winning at a canter. Worse for Cowdrey, he suffered a minor injury in a county match and was persuaded to step aside for the Fifth Test. He never played for England again.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the half, Oklahoma started <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> but was unable to advance, as Nebraska {{recorded}} their first quarterback sack of the game and caused Oklahoma to punt after going three-and-out. Later in the third quarter, Oklahoma used eleven plays, three minutes and 21seconds, to go 99yards and score a touchdown with 1:25 left in the third quarter. It was the longest scoring drive in Big 12 Championship history.|$|E

5|$|Buffalo {{began the}} final quarter <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> in a 2nd-and-11 {{situation}} and were unable to convert the first down. UConn received Buffalo's punt and were also unable to move the ball, going three-and-out and punting back to the Bulls.

5|$|Despite his {{struggles in}} the Test arena, Brown had {{success in the}} tour matches as an opener. He scored 1,448 runs at 57.92 in all {{first-class}} matches, ranking fourth in both the aggregates and averages. He scored eight centuries, second only to Bradman, including 200 against Cambridge University. However, Brown gained criticism for his slow batting. Following his omission from the Test team, Brown batted in a highly circumspect manner to increase the reliability and volume of his scoring. A very occasional off spin bowler, Brown took his career first-class best of 4/16 in his only stint <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> against the South of England.|$|E
5|$|Following these {{consistent}} performances, Davidson {{was selected}} for the 1953 Ashes tour. He improved on his career best in consecutive matches against Tasmania before the Australians sailed to England, scoring 87 and 90. The second effort featured a 167-run partnership with Richie Benaud. It {{was to be the}} first of many joint efforts by the pair of bowling all rounders for Australia over the next ten years. Davidson then took 3/45 <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> including the wickets of Miller and leading Australian batsman Neil Harvey.|$|E

5|$|For Bacup Headley scored 909 {{runs and}} took 20 wickets in 1950, before signing {{to play for}} Dudley in the Birmingham League in 1951. He and {{his family moved to}} Birmingham, and in each the next four seasons Headley {{averaged}} over 65 with the bat and under 17 <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> In his second season, the club topped the league. In total, he scored 2,878 runs for Dudley and, resuming off spin bowling, took 102 wickets. While in England during this time, he played several first-class matches for a Commonwealth XI against an England XI; he scored 20 in 1951 and accumulated 98 and 61 in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Games {{are played}} on a {{rectangular}} court with raised goal rings at each end. Each team attempts to score goals by passing a ball down the court and shooting it through its goal ring. Players are assigned specific positions, which define their roles within the team and restrict their movement to {{certain areas of the}} court. During general play, a player <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> can hold on to it for only three seconds before shooting for a goal or passing to another player. The winning team is the one that scores the most goals. Netball games are 60 minutes long. Variations have been developed to increase the game's pace and appeal to a wider audience.|$|E
5|$|Having {{regained the}} ball, Wake Forest {{answered}} Georgia Tech's drive {{with one of}} their own. Several Wake running backs rushed <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> but it was Wake Forest quarterback Riley Skinner who advanced the ball the most. He completed a 24-yard pass to Willie Idlette, then an eight-yard toss to Nate Morton. Inside Tech territory, Wake's offense stumbled. Skinner was sacked by a Tech defender, and kicker Sam Swank was sent into the game to attempt a 45-yard field goal. Swank's kick was no good, and with 7:26 remaining in the second quarter, Georgia Tech still had a 30 lead.|$|E
50|$|During {{development}} it is {{not practical}} to solder BGAs into place, and sockets are used instead, but tend to be unreliable.

5|$|In December 1964, Baxter played brilliantly {{to set up}} a 2–0 win for Rangers in an away {{game against}} Rapid Vienna in the European Cup. With the game won, rather than play out time Baxter's {{confidence}} over-extended into arrogance to make fun of his opponents <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> In the last minute he went to 'nutmeg' an opponent, who was having none of it and broke Baxter's leg with his challenge. This was to be a watershed for Baxter. During the four months in which he was unable to play he began drinking to his detriment; this ultimately was to curtail his playing career and his life.|$|E
5|$|In FIBA-sanctioned tournaments, {{defending}} team {{players are}} allowed {{to stay on the}} key for an unlimited amount of time. In American professional basketball, defending team players are also prohibited from staying in the key for more than three seconds, unless a player is directly guarding an offensive player. If a player surpasses that time, the defending team will be charged with a defensive three-second violation, which will result in a technical foul where the team <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> shoots one free throw plus ball possession and a reset of the shot clock. In all cases, the count resets if the shot hits the rim or if the player steps out of the lane.|$|E
5|$|In another two-day non-first-class match, Scotland batted {{better than}} in Edinburgh after being sent in to bat, but still lost. Tom Crosskey top-scored with 49 in the hosts' 178, before Bradman top-scored with 123 in his last match in Britain and McCool, {{promoted}} to open, made 108, while Johnson made 95 after being promoted to No. 5. Scotland then made 142 in some light-hearted cricket in which wicketkeeper Tallon took two wickets and stand-in gloveman Johnson stumped a Scottish batsman off Ring. Bradman allowed his non-regular bowlers opportunities <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> and the wickets were shared, with nobody taking more than four.|$|E
