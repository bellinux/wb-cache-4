40|$|The use of {{dissolved}} Al as a tracer for oceanic water {{masses and}} atmospheric dust deposition of biologically important elements, such as iron, requires the {{quantitative assessment of}} its sources and sinks in seawater. Here, we address {{the relative importance of}} oceanic versus atmospheric inputs of Al, and the relationship with nutrient cycling, in a region of high biological productivity in coastal Antarctica. We investigate the concentrations of dissolved Al in seawater, sea ice, meteoric water and sediments collected from northern Marguerite Bay, off the West Antarctic Peninsula, from 2005 to 2006. Dissolved Al concentrations at 15  m water depth varied between 2 and 27  nM, showing a peak between two phytoplankton blooms. We find that, in this coastal setting, upwelling and incorporation of waters from below the surface mixed layer are responsible for this peak in dissolved Al as well as renewal of nutrients. This means that changes in the intensity and frequency of upwelling events may result in changes in biological production and carbon uptake. The waters below the mixed layer are most likely enriched in Al as a result of sea ice formation, either causing the injection of Al-rich brines or the resuspension of sediments and entrainment of pore fluids by brine cascades. Glacial, snow and sea ice melt contribute secondarily to the supply of Al to surface waters. Total particulate Al ranges from 93 to 2057  mg/g, and increases with meteoric water input {{towards the end of the}} summer, indicating glacial runoff is an important source of particulate Al. The (Al/Si) opal of sediment core top material is considerably higher than <b>water</b> column <b>opal</b> collected by sediment traps, indicative of a diagenetic overprint and incorporation of Al at the sediment-water interface.

When the germanium-to-silicon ratios (Ge/Si) were plotted versus depth and/or silicon concentrations, higher values are observed in surface waters (low in silicon) and decreased with depth (high in silicon).

Features in both opal IR absorbance and photonic band gap reproduce the physisorbed water regimes. This allows direct assessment of the water content and its evolution just by routine optical spectroscopy, being a useful tool for local and nondestructive analysis of colloidal silica.

40|$|Optical {{properties}} {{were collected}} along a transect across cyclonic eddy Opal in {{the lee of}} Hawaii during the E-Flux III field experiment (10 – 27 March 2005). The eddy was characterized by an intense doming of isopycnal surfaces, and by an enhanced Deep Chlorophyll Maximum Layer (DCML) within its core. The phytoplankton bloom was diatom dominated, evidencing an eddy-induced shift in ecological community. Four distinct regions were identified throughout the <b>water</b> column at <b>Opal's</b> core: a surface mixed layer dominated by small phytoplankton; a layer dominated by "senescent" diatoms between the bottom of the upper mixed layer and the DCML; the DCML; and a deep layer characterized by decreasing phytoplankton activity. We focused on two parameters, the ratio of chlorophyll concentration to particulate beam attenuation coefficient, [chl]/cp, and the backscattering ratio (the particle backscattering to particle scattering ratio), b~bp, and tested their sensitivity to the changes in particle composition observed through the water column at the eddy center. Our results show that [chl]/cp is not a good indicator. Despite the shift in ecological community, the ratio remains controlled primarily by the variation in chlorophyll concentration per cell with depth (photoadaptation), so that its values increase throughout the DCML. Steeper increase of [chl]/cp below the DCML suggest that remineralization might be another important controlling factor. On the other hand, b~bp clearly indicates a shift from a small phytoplankton to a diatom dominated community. Below an upper layer characterized by constant values, the b~bp showed a rapid decrease to a broad minimum within the DCML. The higher values below the DCML are consistent with enhanced remineralization below the eddy-induced bloom. Both the "senescent" and the "healthy" diatom layers are characterized by similar optical properties, indicating some possible limitations in using optical measurements to fully characterize the composition of suspended material in the water column. The inverse relationship between b~bp, reported by others for Case II waters, is observed neither for the background conditions, nor {{in the presence of the}} eddy-induced diatom bloom. Between the two parameters, only the backscattering ratio showed the potential to be a successful indicator for changes in particle composition in Case I waters...|$|R
40|$|Millennial-scale paleoceanographic {{changes in}} the Bering Sea during the last 71 kyrs were reconstructed using geochemical and isotope proxies (biogenic opal, CaCO 3, and total organic carbon (TOC), {{nitrogen}} and carbon isotopes of sedimentary organic matters) and microfossil (radiolaria and foraminifera) data from two cores (PC 23 A and PC 24 A) which were collected from the northern continental slope area at intermediate <b>water</b> depths. Biogenic <b>opal</b> and TOC contents were generally high with high sedimentation rates during the last deglaciation. Laminated sediment depositions during the Early-Holocene (EH) and Bølling-Allerød (BA) were closely related with the increased primary productivity recorded by high biogenic opal and TOC contents and high d 15 N values. Enhanced surface-water productivity was attributed to increased nutrient supply from strengthened Bering Slope Current (BSC) and from increased amount of glacial melt-water, resulting in high C/N ratios and low d 13 C values, and high proportion of Rhizoplegma boreale during the last deglaciation. In contrast, low surface-water productivity during the last glacial period was due to depleted nutrient supply caused by strong stratification and to restricted phytoplankton bloom by extensive sea ice distribution under cold climates. Extensive formation of sea ice produces more oxygen-rich intermediate-water, leading to oxic bottom-water conditions due to active ventilation, which favored good preservation of oxic benthic foraminifera species. Remarkable CaCO 3 peaks coeval with high biogenic opal and TOC contents in both cores during MIS 3 to MIS 4 are most likely correlated with Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) events. High d 15 N and d 13 Corg values during D-O interstadials support increased surface-water productivity resulting from nutrients supplied mainly by intensified BSC. During the EH, BA and D-O interstadials, dominant benthic foraminifera species indicate dysoxic bottom-water conditions {{as a result of}} increased surface-water productivity and weak ventilation of intermediate-water with mitigated sea ice development caused by strengthening of the Alaskan Stream. It is of note that the bottom-water conditions and formation of intermediate-water in the Bering Sea during the last glacial period are related to the variation of dissolved oxygen concentration of the bottom-water in the northeastern Pacific and to strong ventilation of intermediate-water in the northwestern Pacific. Thus, the millennial-scale paleoceanographic events in the Bering Sea during the D-O interstadials are closely associated with the intermediate-water ventilation, ultimately leading to weakening of North Pacific Intermediate Water...|$|R

Polarstern sedirnents {{from the}} eastern, {{southern}} and central Weddell Sea were sarnpled with a boxcorer andlor a multicorer. The 24 sampling locations are distributed {{over the whole}} depth range, from shelf to pelagic environments. Porewater concentrations of aluminium, fluoride, manganese, nitrate, nitrite, oxygen and silicate, the pH and the alkalinity were measured. Of the sediment the opal, calcium carbonate and organic carbon content were quantified. The 210 Pb-profile was measured for three sedirnent cores. This investigation deals with the estimation of the amounts of opal and organic carbon (Corg) that are transported into the sediment, the regional distribution of these flux rates and the early diagenetic processes that control the preservation of organic carbon and opal in the sediment. The flux and degradation rates of organic carbon were determined by modelling the rneasured oxygen and nitrate profiles. The highest flux and degradation rates {{were found in the}} eastern shelf sediments. Due to the high Corg-flux (> 500 mmol C m**- 2 a- 1) in this area the oxic environment is restricted to the upper 3 cm of the sediment. In contrast to this, the oxic Zone in the pelagic sedirnents of the Weddell Sea has probably an extension of a few meters. The Corg-flux here, computed from the flux of nitrate throug h the sedimentlwater-interface, is less than 50 mmol C m**- 2 a**- 1. The flux of organic carbon into the sediments of the continental slope area is usually intermediate between the values computed for the shelf and pelagic sediments. Exceptions are the continental slope region north of Halley Bay. In these sediments the measured oxygen and nitrate profiles indicate a relatively high organic carbon flux. This could be a result of the recurrent development of a coastal polynia in this area. The bioturbation rate determined in this region by a 210 Pb-profile is 0, 019 cm** 2 a**- 1. In the Weddell Sea the opal content at the sediment surface (0 - 1 cm depth) varies between 0, 1 and 7 %-wt. These opal concentrations are rnuch lower than the opal contents determined for the sediments of the ROSS Sea by Ledford-Hoffmann et al. (1986 doi: 10. 1016 / 0016 - 7037 (86) 90263 - 2). Therefore the importance of the Antarctic shelf regions for the global silica cycle as stated by Ledford-Hoffmann et al. (1986) has to be reconsidered. The regional distribution of the opal content and the computed opal flux rates are correlated with the organic carbon flux rates. The processes controlling the preservation of opal are discussed based On the measured aluminium and silicate concentrations in the Pore <b>water</b> and the <b>opal</b> content of the sediment. The depth distribution of the Si- and Al-concentration of the porewater indicates that the reconstitution of clay minerals takes place in the immediate vicinity of the sediment-water nterface. A characterization of these minerals e. g. the estimation of the Si/AI-ratio (Mackin and Aller, 1984 a doi: 10. 1016 / 0016 - 7037 (84) 90251 - 5, 1984 b doi: 10. 1016 / 0016 - 7037 (84) 90252 - 7) is not possible.
