40|$|A {{data base}} {{describing}} {{the properties of}} the exhaust cloud produced by the launch of the Space Transportation System and the <b>acidic</b> <b>fallout</b> observed after each of the first four launches was assembled from a series of ground and aircraft based measurements made during the launches of STS 2, 3, and 4. Additional data were obtained from ground-based measurements during firings of the 6. 4 percent model of the Solid Rocket Booster at the Marshall Center. Analysis indicates that the <b>acidic</b> <b>fallout</b> is produced by atomization of the deluge water spray by the rocket exhaust on the pad followed by rapid scavening of hydrogen chloride gas aluminum oxide particles from the Solid Rocket Boosters. The atomized spray is carried aloft by updrafts created by the hot exhaust and deposited down wind. Aircraft measurements in the STS- 3 ground cloud showed an insignificant number of ice nuclei. Although no measurements were made in the column cloud, the possibility of inadvertent weather modification caused by the interaction of ice nuclei with natural clouds appears remote...|$|R

50|$|The major {{characteristics}} of Burns Bog {{is that it}} is <b>wet,</b> <b>acidic,</b> and peat-forming. It is a wetland ecosystem with a diverse array of plant, animal, and insect species. A major component of Burns Bog is sphagnum moss, which is able to hold about 30 times its weight in water. Sphagnum moss can grow under <b>wet</b> and <b>acidic</b> conditions and it is the major building block of peat in Burns Bog. Breakdown of organic matter in the bog progresses slowly due to low oxygen content and high acidity of the water.|$|R

40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to assess physiological responses of declining sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) in southern Quebec to <b>wet</b> <b>acidic</b> precipitation and increased soil fertility. Leaves of sugar maple were relatively acidic, had low external neutralization capacity (ENC = 5. 1 $ mu$equiv. H$ sp{+} rm g sp{- 1 }$) and buffering capacity index (BCI = 103 $ mu$equiv. H$ sp{+} rm g sp{- 1 }$), and higher ENC/BCI compared to three other tree species. Deciduous species showed a higher BCI and a lower ENC in August. Our results suggest that sugar maple may be relatively sensitive to <b>wet</b> <b>acidic</b> deposition and that leaf buffering capacity is related to photosynthesis potential and seasonal change in foliar Ca concentration. Foliar analyses revealed that fertilization {{with a mixture of}} K, Ca, and Mg had significant effects on leaf concentrations of K, free amino acids (FAA) and the ratios of N to K, and FAA to N after two growing seasons. Our results suggest that base cation fertilization improved the N and K status of sugar maple and that leaf carbon partitioning appeared to be more dynamic in fertilized trees...|$|R
50|$|Poor fen {{is found}} where {{the ground is}} {{permanently}} wet with nutrient-poor water which is somewhat acidic. For example it occurs as the vegetation of flushes (marshy springs on slopes), in places where neutral water enters more <b>acidic</b> bogs, in <b>wet</b> <b>acidic</b> grassland, and sometimes in the flatter parts of flood-meadows {{where much of the}} water is ombrotrophic (derived directly from rainfall). It sometimes forms a floating mat over water or very wet peat, making a mobile surface known as quaking bog.|$|R

50|$|Dalibarda repens (dewdrop, false violet, star violet, Robin runaway. French Canadian: dalibarde rampante) is a {{perennial}} plant (a forb) {{in the rose}} family, native to eastern and central Canada and to the northeastern and north-central United States. It is the only species in the genus Dalibarda, which is closely allied with the genus Rubus (brambles, blackberries, raspberries). The species is often included in the genus Rubus as Rubus repens (L.) Kuntze. It is fairly easily grown in shady locations in damp to <b>wet,</b> <b>acidic</b> soils, and is frequently used in wildflower and bog gardens as a ground-cover.|$|R
50|$|Lachnanthes is a genus of {{monocotyledonous}} {{plants in}} the bloodwort family containing only one species, i.e., Lachnanthes caroliniana, commonly known as Carolina redroot or bloodroot. The plant is native to eastern North America, from southeastern Nova Scotia (especially the Molega Lake area) and Massachusetts in the north, south to Florida and Cuba, and west along the Gulf of Mexico to Louisiana. It has also been reported from {{an island in the}} western Caribbean off the coast of Honduras. It prefers <b>wet,</b> <b>acidic,</b> usually sandy soils, restricting it to various wetland habitats such as bogs, pinelands, hammocks and pocosins, among others.|$|R
50|$|Corduroy roads {{can also}} be built as a {{foundation}} for other surfacing. If the logs are buried in <b>wet,</b> <b>acidic,</b> anaerobic soils such as peat or muskeg, they decay very slowly. A few corduroy road foundations that date back to the early 20th century still exist in North America. One example is the Alaska Highway between Burwash Landing and Koidern, Yukon, Canada, which was rebuilt in 1943, {{less than a year after}} the original route was graded on thin soil and vegetation over permafrost, by using corduroy, then building gravel road on top. During the 1980s, the gravel was covered with a chip-seal. The late 1990s saw replacement of this road with modern road construction, including rerouting of the entire highway.|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of the 6. 4 -percent Shuttle Model Test Facility {{to the study of}} the Shuttle exhaust cloud properties is discussed with emphasis on the properties related to the production of the deposition (submillimeter drops composed of an acidic liquid and alumina solids) which occurs with each launch. An analysis of test data suggests that the major fraction of the liquid in the deposition is produced directly through the interaction between the exhaust and the deluge water spray and then modified by rapid scavenging of <b>wet</b> <b>acidic</b> aluminum oxide particles. Based on this conclusion, the possibility arises that the acid in the deposition can be neutralized by addition of a base to the deluge water. Current work with the 6. 4 -percent model is directed toward verification of this hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|Rubus apricus Wimmer, {{a species}} of Rubus ser. Hystrix, is {{reported}} from Hungary for the fi rst time.

The paper presents the morphological features {{and the distribution of}} the species, the characterisation of the newly discovered locality and the assessment of the possible ways of the introduction. Th e Hungarian locality is situated in an approximately 80 years old, mixed Scots pine plantation on mesic-slightly <b>wet</b> <b>acidic</b> sandy soil. Th e origin of the stand is dubious, both the introduction by saplings or seeds used during forest regeneration and a natural colonisation as a consequence of a long distance endozoochorous dispersal event are possible. The latter variation is strengthened by the presence of several other Central European bramble species in the pine plantations of the region...|$|R
50|$|Muskeg forms because permafrost, clay or bedrock {{prevents}} water drainage. The {{water from}} rain and snow collects, forming permanently waterlogged vegetation and stagnant pools. Muskeg is <b>wet,</b> <b>acidic,</b> and relatively infertile, which prevents large trees from growing, although stunted shore pine, cottonwood, some species of willow, and black spruce are typically found in these habitats. It needs two conditions to develop: abundant rain and cool summers. A dead plant that falls on dry soil is normally attacked by bacteria and fungi and quickly rots. If the same plant lands in water or on saturated soil, it decomposes differently. Less oxygen is available under water, so aerobic bacteria and fungi fail to colonize the submerged debris effectively. In addition, cool temperatures retard bacterial and fungal growth. This causes slow decomposition, {{and thus the}} plant debris gradually accumulates to form peat and eventually muskeg. Depending on the underlying topography of the land, muskeg can reach depths greater than 30 metres (100 ft).|$|R
50|$|The {{constantly}} <b>wet,</b> <b>acidic</b> {{environment has}} contributed for the developing a unique ecosystem. The deeper {{parts of the}} reserve are covered in communities of Sphagnum Capillifolium, Sphagnum Warnstorfii, {{and other types of}} sphagnum. The territory is virtually treeless, with some shrub communities such as sallow, juniper and blueberry, and the occasional mountain pine. The ground flora consists mainly of plants from the Cyperaceae family. Gentiana, the red Aven, Geum coccineum, and Saxifraga Rotundifolia are also relatively common plants. It {{is also one of the}} few places in Bulgaria where one can see the rare native carnivorous plants - Pinguicula Balcanica, Drosera Rotundifolia, and two species of Utricularia, found in small ponds - Utricularia Minor and Utricularia Australis. On very rare occasions, visitors can see the bright yellow flowers of Trollius Europeaus there. The fauna is rich, too. Deer, wolves, wild pigs, and, rarely, bears have been known to cross the reserve. On the higher parts, the very rare Spalax Leucodon can also be found.|$|R
40|$|Acid rain is {{a general}} term used to {{describe}} either <b>wet</b> or dry <b>acidic</b> deposition. <b>Wet</b> <b>acidic</b> deposition is what is {{commonly referred to as}} acid rain {{as it is in the}} form of rain, snow or fog. Dry deposition can be equally as important as wet deposition, but is in the form of acidic gases and particles. Scientists prefer to use the term acid deposition in referring to acid rain, as it includes both wet and dry deposition. All rain is naturally acidic with a pH of around 5. 5. The majority of the acid rain that falls in the United States has a pH of 4. 3 (www. epa. gov/airmarkets/acidrain). It is difficult to measure the percentage of acid that is in the form of wet deposition, as when rain falls it can mix with dry deposition. Acid rain is formed mainly by the combustion of fossil fuels, specifically coal and oil and smelting of iron ores that release pollutants into the atmosphere. Acid rain is formed through two main sources. The sources are categorized as primary and secondary pollutants. Primary pollutants are from industrial and domestic human activities and include sulfur dioxide (SO 2), and nitric oxides (NOx). Secondary pollutants are formed by chemical reactions in the atmosphere with primary pollutants. The most importan...|$|R
40|$|Creeping {{buttercup}} {{is a short}} perennial plant (about 6 - {{12 inches}} tall) with bright yellow flowers that shoot up to 24 inches high. The long stems grow along the ground and take root at the leaf nodes. The three-part leaves are dark green, often with pale spots, and have deeply toothed margins. Both the leaves and stems are hairy. The flowers, usually with 5 petals, are born on long erect stems spring through summer. Though creeping buttercup {{is capable of surviving}} in many soil types and exposures, it is notably problematic in <b>wet,</b> <b>acidic</b> soils with poor drainage. Impacts: Creeping buttercup spreads easily from seed and by their long stems which root and form new plants at every leaf joint. It commonly invades areas where the vegetation has been removed and wet pastures, where it displaces more desirable forage. The sap of creeping buttercup contains a toxic compound that can taint milk or cause cattle to become ill. Most often, livestock will try to avoid eating buttercup because the sap is ver...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the short-term biomass accumulation of forest trees exposed to <b>wet</b> <b>acidic</b> depositions. A hierarchical Bayesian model of tree growth was developed based on the data of a short-term experiment in which 2 -year-old Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora Sieb. et Zucc.) seedlings were exposed to aqueous phase OH radicals generated by an iron-oxalate-H 2 O 2 mist (a pseudo-polluted dew) over two growing periods. We conducted a statistical comparison of tree growth between the control and pollution treatment groups by using the growth model incorporated the random effects due to the unknown characteristics of each seedling. The variability among seedlings is expressed in this model by the posterior probabilistic distributions of unobserved dry weight of a stem cohort before exposure treatment. The analysis {{of the effects of}} pollution treatment on the stem growth revealed that this treatment decreases the biomass allocation in the current year stems. However, the effects on the relative growth rate of pre-existing stems were unclear. Based on these results, we can speculate that in a polluted environment, the short-term growth of the young stems in the seedlings inhibited by pollution treatment, thereby resulting in the slowdown of long-term biomass accumulation. This can explain the patterns observed in the declining Japanese red pine forests that are subjected to OH-generating dews in the polluted area of western Japan...|$|R

Don {{field test}} stakes (20 x 20 x 500 mm) exposed in <b>wet</b> <b>acidic</b> (pH 4. 5) soil for 12 - 24 months showed predominance {{of an unusual}} type of decay characterised by tunnelling attack of wood cell walls. After 2 years, decay was moderate to severe in wood treated to ground contact CCA specifications and also equivalent retentions of creosote, {{and a number of}} new generation preservatives. Relative to other New Zealand temperate test sites and also an Australian tropical site, the New Zealand acidic soil test site was very aggressive. Correlative microscopy, including light microscopy (LM), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), was used to elucidate the micromorphology of this attack. Tunnels of diameter 0. 2 — 5 urn were present throughout all layers of the cell wall, and their orientation was not related to the cellulose microfibril orientation. They also showed no preference for particular cell wall layers, indicating a lignin-degrading capability. CLSM images showed that living, connecting fungal hyphae were present in the cell lumina and tunnels, and this was also confirmed by other forms of microscopy used. This type of attack was predominant in wood that was highly saturated with water whereas wood that was less moist was attacked predominantly by classical white rot at the same site. Ongoing isolation and incubation studies in conjunction with further microscopy should enable identification of the fungal species involved...|$|R

40|$|There are policy {{pressures}} to make agriculture more environmentally sustainable {{and to give}} a more local expression to agri-environmental priorities. This paper considers these moves, with particular reference to the beef sector, and speculates on the further policy responses required to facilitate benign local agri-environmental management. The UK beef sector is characterized by its complexity and diversity but four major systems can be identified operating at varying levels of intensity. Of these, suckler herds and grass-rearing systems have long been associated with high natural value forms of agricultural land management. Many of the cherished habitats and landscapes of the UK are dependent upon grazing for their ecological and amenity value. However {{a combination of the}} BSE crisis, the strength of sterling and the recent Foot & Mouth epidemic threatens the sustainability of these high nature value grazing systems. The importance of grazing to fifty selected Sites of Special Scientific Interest is highlighted in the paper. Survey work identified a wide range of systems to be particularly vulnerable to changes in profitability in the beef sector, including: coastal grazing marsh, <b>wet</b> <b>acidic</b> grassland / marshland, upland moor and heath, calcareous grassland and neutral grassland. To maintain these systems requires agricultural policy to be more sensitive to local conditions than appears currently to be the case. There is little policy support for beef farmers in a regional context, still less giving special prominence to those farming within particular biotopes. Nor has there been sufficient policy encouragement to markets for traditional and local beef breeds. The continuing pressure for CAP reform offers further opportunity for policies to be devolved to regions and localities...|$|R
40|$|Measurement {{techniques}} that provide molecular-level information {{are needed to}} elucidate the multiphase processes that produce secondary organic aerosol (SOA) species in the atmosphere. Here we demonstrate the application of ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IMS–MS) to the simultaneous characterization of the elemental composition and molecular structures of organic species in the gas and particulate phases. Molecular ions of gas-phase organic species are measured online with IMS–MS after ionization with a custom-built nitrate chemical ionization (CI) source. This CI–IMS–MS technique is used to obtain time-resolved measurements (5  min) of highly oxidized organic molecules during the 2013 Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) ambient field campaign in the forested SE US. The ambient IMS–MS signals are consistent with laboratory IMS–MS spectra obtained from single-component carboxylic acids and multicomponent mixtures of isoprene and monoterpene oxidation products. Mass-mobility correlations in the 2 -D IMS–MS space provide a means of identifying ions with similar molecular structures within complex mass spectra and are used to separate and identify monoterpene oxidation products in the ambient data that are produced from different chemical pathways. Water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) constituents of fine aerosol particles that are not resolvable with standard analytical separation methods, such as liquid chromatography (LC), are shown to be separable with IMS–MS coupled to an electrospray ionization (ESI) source. The capability to use ion mobility to differentiate between isomers is demonstrated for organosulfates derived from the reactive uptake of isomers of isoprene epoxydiols (IEPOX) onto <b>wet</b> <b>acidic</b> sulfate aerosol. Controlled fragmentation of precursor ions by collisionally induced dissociation (CID) in the transfer region between the IMS and the MS is used to validate MS peak assignments, elucidate structures of oligomers, and confirm {{the presence of the}} organosulfate functional group...|$|R
