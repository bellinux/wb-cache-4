500|$|Before {{the renewal}} of the fifth season, Abrams stated some {{skepticism}} for a renewal opportunity, but hoped {{that if it was}} cancelled, that it may be picked up by another network. On the other hand, Abrams considered that if Fox did pick up the show for a fifth season, [...] "the next year would be the great ending for the show". Similarly, Fox's Reilly remained cautious about a renewal, noting that while the show {{is one of the top}} shows in the Friday night slot, [...] "it's an expensive show. We lose a lot of money on the show." [...] Reilly further reiterated the dedication of the fans of the show for helping it to its fourth season and continued success. When asked about whether the writers would have enough notice to write the fourth-season finale as a series finale if necessary, Reilly stated, [...] "That's a Peter Roth issue" [...] (chief executive of Warner Bros. Television). To which Roth responded, [...] "We have no plans to give viewers closure this season because we expect the series to continue". In late January 2012, Fox and Warner Bros. Television were working on negotiating a lower licensing cost for the show to allow a fifth season to occur; this would not only help Fox reduce its losses on the show, but would also bring the total number of episodes above 100, giving Warner Bros. a better opportunity to syndicate reruns of the show. Before the announcement of the fifth season, Wyman and Pinkner stated that they would have created a series finale for the end of the fourth season should the show be cancelled; Wyman stated [...] "We want to take care of the fans. We <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> where it would have gone, but we also know the show has been a commitment and we want everyone to be satisfied with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|After President Kennedy's brother, Robert Kennedy, {{boarded the}} plane, Kennedy's casket {{was removed from}} the rear {{entrance}} and loaded into a light gray US Navy ambulance for its transport to the Bethesda Naval Hospital for an autopsy and mortician's preparations. When Jackie Kennedy stepped off the plane with her brother-in-law, her pink suit and legs were still stained with her husband's blood. All that long afternoon and into {{the early morning hours of}} the next day, the widow objected to leaving her husband's body, except for the swearing in of Johnson. She also refused to change out of her blood-stained suit; Lady Bird Johnson, in her audio diary, quoted Mrs. Kennedy as saying [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what they have done to Jack." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Turner Classic Movies' David Kalat, the film's {{director}} William F. Claxton {{also came}} from a Western film background. In directing Night of the Lepus, he applied the same techniques used in his other films and declined the use of [...] "standard" [...] horror effects that would have enhanced the atmosphere, such as [...] "canted camera angles, dark shadows, [...] eerie music." [...] Rory Calhoun was cast as rancher Cole Hilman, whose ranch would {{be the start of}} the rabbit explosion. Well known for his western work, Night of the Lepus put him in unfamiliar territory as it was his first science fiction role, however, he found familiarity in the Western film trappings and his role as a rancher. Janet Leigh, who played Gerry Bennet, took the role because it was being filmed close to her own home, allowing her to travel home on weekends and allowing her family to visit her on the set. Though she felt the script [...] "read well", she declined to allow her two children play minor roles as she did not <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> or be part of any type of horror film. She would later state the film lacked an [...] "ideal director" [...] to bring the script to life, and the film failed, in part, because it was impossible to make a [...] "bunny rabbit menacing." [...] Fellow The Rifleman actor Paul Fix was given the role of the sheriff of the town under siege, while DeForest Kelley, who frequently guest starred in Westerns, was cast as Elgin Clark, the college president who asked researchers to try to stop the rabbits.|$|E

Ellen decided she would wait until after supper, and at a favorable moment lay it unopened on the fire. What did she care what it contained? Manifestly it was a gift.

60|$|The {{whole school}} rushed noisily into the play-ground. The new boys {{were told to}} go into the middle, while the others {{stationed}} themselves along opposite walls. They began to play Pig in the Middle. The old boys ran from wall to wall while the new boys tried to catch them: when one was seized and the mystic words said--one, two, three, and a pig for me--he became a prisoner and, turning sides, helped to catch those who were still free. Philip saw a boy running past and tried to catch him, but his limp gave him no chance; and the runners, taking their opportunity, made straight for the ground he covered. Then one of them had the brilliant idea of imitating Philip's clumsy run. Other boys saw it and began to laugh; then they all copied the first; and they ran round Philip, limping grotesquely, screaming in their treble voices with shrill laughter. They lost their heads with the delight of their new amusement, and choked with helpless merriment. One of them tripped Philip up and he fell, heavily as he always fell, and cut his knee. They laughed all the louder when he got up. A boy pushed him from behind, and he would have fallen again if another had not caught him. The game was forgotten in the entertainment of Philip's deformity. One of them invented an odd, rolling limp that struck the rest as supremely ridiculous, and several of the boys lay down on the ground and rolled about in laughter: Philip was completely scared. He could not make out why they were laughing at him. His heart beat so that he could hardly breathe, and he was more frightened than he had ever been in his life. He stood still stupidly while the boys ran round him, mimicking and laughing; they shouted to him to try and catch them; but he did not move. He did not <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him run any more. He was using all his strength to prevent himself from crying.|$|E

60|$|Supposing half a {{dozen or}} a dozen men were cast ashore from a wreck on an {{uninhabited}} island and {{left to their own}} resources, one of course, according to his capacity, would be set to one business and one to another; the strongest to dig and to cut wood, and to build huts for the rest: the most dexterous to make shoes out of bark and coats out of skins; the best educated to look for iron or lead in the rocks, and to plan the channels for the irrigation of the fields. But though their labours were thus naturally severed, that small group of shipwrecked men would understand well enough that the speediest progress was to be made by helping each other,--not by opposing each other; and they would know that this help could only be properly given so long as they were frank and open in their relations, and the difficulties which each lay under properly explained to the rest. So that any appearance of secresy or separateness in the actions of any of them would instantly, and justly, be looked upon with suspicion by the rest, as the sign of some selfish or foolish proceeding {{on the part of the}} individual. If, for instance, the scientific man were found to have gone out at night, unknown to the rest, to alter the sluices, the others would think, and in all probability rightly think, that he wanted to get the best supply of water to his own field; and if the shoemaker refused to show them where the bark grew which he made the sandals of, they would naturally think, and in all probability rightly think, that he didn't <b>want</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how much there was of it, and that he meant to ask from them more corn and potatoes in exchange for his sandals than the trouble of making them deserved. And thus, although each man would have a portion of time to himself in which he was allowed to do what he chose without let or inquiry,--so long as he was working in that particular business which he had undertaken for the common benefit, any secresy on his part would be immediately supposed to mean mischief; and would require to be accounted for, or put an end to: and this all the more because, whatever the work might be, certainly there would be difficulties about it which, when once they were well explained, might be more or less done away with by the help of the rest; so that assuredly every one of them would advance with his labour not only more happily, but more profitably and quickly, by having no secrets, and by frankly bestowing, and frankly receiving, such help as lay in his way to get or to give.|$|E
