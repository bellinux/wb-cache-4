It remains customary for Indian Hindu <b>women</b> <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> <b>age</b> to wear a nose stud, usually in the left nostril, due to the nostril's association with the female reproductive organs in Ayurvedic medicine. This piercing is sometimes done the night before the woman marries.|$|E
5|$|As of 2000, {{the median}} intake of iodine from {{food in the}} United States was 240 to 300μg/day for men and 190 to 210μg/day for women. The general US {{population}} has adequate iodine nutrition, with <b>women</b> <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> <b>age</b> and pregnant women having a possible mild risk of deficiency.

5|$|As of 2012, 57% of <b>women</b> <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> <b>age</b> want {{to avoid}} {{pregnancy}} (867 of 1520million). About 222 million women however {{were not able to}} access birth control, 53million of whom were in sub-Saharan Africa and 97million of whom were in Asia. This results in 54million unplanned pregnancies and nearly 80,000 maternal deaths a year. Part of the reason that many women are without birth control is that many countries limit access due to religious or political reasons, while another contributor is poverty. Due to restrictive abortion laws in Sub-Saharan Africa, many women turn to unlicensed abortion providers for unintended pregnancy, resulting in about 2–4% obtaining unsafe abortions each year.|$|E

5|$|The {{disease is}} caused by {{bacteria}} that spread from the vagina and cervix. Infections by Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis are present in 75 to 90 percent of cases. Often multiple different bacteria are involved. Without treatment about 10 percent of those with a chlamydial infection and 40 percent of those with a gonorrhea infection will develop PID. Risk factors {{are similar to those}} of sexually transmitted infections generally and include a high number of sexual partners and drug use. Vaginal douching may also increase the risk. The diagnosis is typically based on the presenting signs and symptoms. It is recommended that the disease be considered in all <b>women</b> <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> <b>age</b> who have lower abdominal pain. A definitive diagnosis of PID is made by finding pus involving the fallopian tubes during surgery. Ultrasound may also be useful in diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Topical {{antibiotics}} deemed safe {{during pregnancy}} include clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole (all category B), due to negligible systemic absorption. Nadifloxacin and dapsone (category C) are other topical antibiotics {{that may be}} used to treat acne in pregnant women, but have received less study. No adverse fetal events have been reported from the topical use of dapsone. If retinoids are used there is a high risk of abnormalities occurring in the developing fetus; <b>women</b> <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> <b>age</b> are therefore required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne. Oral antibiotics deemed safe for pregnancy (all category B) include azithromycin, cephalosporins, and penicillins. Tetracyclines (category D) are contraindicated during pregnancy as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth, resulting in yellow discoloration and thinned tooth enamel. Their use during pregnancy has been associated with development of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and is further avoided for this reason.|$|E

5|$|Isotretinoin is an oral retinoid {{that is very}} {{effective}} for severe nodular acne, and moderate acne that is stubborn to other treatments. One to two months use is typically adequate to see improvement. Acne often resolves completely or is much milder after a 4–6month course of oral isotretinoin. After a single course, about 80% of people report an improvement, with more than 50% reporting complete remission. About 20% of patients require a second course. Although concerns have emerged that isotretinoin use is linked with {{an increased risk of}} adverse effects, like depression, suicidality, anemia, although there is no clear evidence to support some of these claims. Isotretinoin use in <b>women</b> <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> <b>age</b> is regulated due to its known harmful effects in pregnancy. For such a woman to be considered a candidate for isotretinoin, she must have a confirmed negative pregnancy test and use an effective form of birth control. In 2008, the United States started the iPLEDGE program to prevent isotretinoin use during pregnancy. iPledge requires the woman under consideration for isotretinoin therapy to have two negative pregnancy tests and mandates the use of two types of birth control for at least one month before therapy begins and one month after therapy is complete. The effectiveness of the iPledge program has been questioned due to continued instances of contraception nonadherence.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{deficiencies}} of folic acid, vitamin B 12, and microelements during pregnancy {{may affect the}} health of newborns. Objectives: To assess the serum levels of folate, vitamin B 12, iron, zinc and copper in healthy <b>women</b> <b>of</b> the <b>childbearing</b> <b>ages</b> in Gorgan, northern Iran. Methodology: This descriptive, cross-sectional study was carried out on 100 <b>women</b> <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> <b>ages</b> in northern Iran during November 2007 -March 2008. The serum levels of folate, vitamin B 12, iron, copper and zinc were evaluated by laboratory tests.

25|$|Sociobiologists and {{evolutionary}} psychologists have hypothesized that causing pregnancy by rape {{may be a}} mating strategy in humans, {{as a way for}} males to ensure the survival of their genes by passing them on to future generations. Randy Thornhill and Craig T. Palmer are key popularizers of this hypothesis. They assert that most rape victims are <b>women</b> <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> <b>age</b> and that many cultures treat rape as a crime against the victim's husband. They state that rape victims suffer less emotional distress when they are subjected to more violence, and that married women and <b>women</b> <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> <b>age</b> experience greater psychological distress after a rape than do girls, single women or post-menopausal women. Rape-pregnancy rates are crucial in evaluating these theories, because a high or low pregnancy rate from rape would determine whether such adaptations are favored or disfavored by natural selection.|$|E
