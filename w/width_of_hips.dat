Prague: Charles University in Prague, 2 nd Faculty of Medicine, Department of rehabilitation and exercise medicine, 2012. 96 pages. Supervisor Mgr. Magdaléna Lepšíková. Abstract The diploma thesis deals with neurophysiological concept of body schema {{and evaluation of}} the effect of the Feldenkrais method (FM) on its quality. The research comprises two groups of probands without motor system disorders. The participants passed an investigation of the body schema quality by the following tests: a test of estimation of body dimensions (width of mouth, width of shoulders, <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>hips</b> and length of foot), a modification of Petrie's test, a test of proprioception and a test of graphestesia. The examination was accomplished before FM investigation and after the course. The first group (group A) comprised 13 individuals (5 males, 8 females) who participated in a semestral course of FM, the second group of probands (group B) included 17 individuals (3 males, 14 females) underwent a two days long FM program. A significant improvement (p = 0, 0027) in the estimation of the length of foot was detected after FM intervention in group B. There was not a significant improvement in any of estimated body dimensions in group A [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|Today body-building as a spport is {{well known}} and {{accepted}} world-wide. When scientifi researches on this fi eld are in question, {{it is evident that}} they are very rare partly and probably due to its real interpretation as well as due to its insuffi cient affi rmation and popularization here. Reason for this is also the wrong interpretation of the sport’s essence among sports-people – the body-builders themselves and among the experts and scientists from this fi eld. Intrest in the research of morphological sphere of body-builders was inspired by the fact that exercising body-building is a very specifi c physical activity that, due to its nature, demands body-builders to have specifi c morphological characteristics that characterize and differ them from other sports-people. The goal of this research was determining the structure of the morhologicall sphere of a body-builder. It was performed on the sample of 30 selected sportsmen, bodybuilders, of chronological age between 17 and 19 ( 6 months), members of the Sports' Club Strength ''Leskovac'', the Weight Lifters' Club '' Dubočica'' and the Body-building Club '' Dubočica'' from Leskovac. All the examiees have been submitted to training processes during a period longer than a year. For the purpose of determining the structure of the morphological sphere the Factor Analysis has been applied. Based on the data from the matrix of the Factor Structure the isolated factors can be interpreted in the following manner: The fi rst isolated factor in the sphere of applied anthropometric variables can be defi ned as a dimension of the body-volume and the transversal dimensionality of the skeleton sine it’s best defi ned by the following variables: the chest-circumference (AOGKS), the upper-arm circumference (AONAD), the thigh circumference (AOBUT), the body-weight (AMAST) and the shoulder-width (ASIRA). The second isolated factor in the sphere of applied anthropometric variables can be defi ned as the longitudinal dimensionality of the skeleton since it’s best defi ned by the following variables: the body-height (AVIST), the leg-length (ADUNO) and the arm-length (ADURU). The third isolated factor in the sphere of applied anthropometric variables can be defi ned as the transversal dimensionality of the skeleton since it is best defi ned by the following variables: the pelvis width (ASIKA), the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>hips.</b> The fourth isolated factor in the sphere of applied anthropometric variables can be described as a dimension of the fat under-skin tissue since it is best defi ned by the following variables: the upper-arm skinfold (AKNNA), the back skin-fold (ANKLE) and the belly skin-fold (AKNTR) ...|$|E

Current methods require proprietary software or have not been well validated; our purpose was to develop and assess the reliability of a digital joint space width quantification method using public access software. We studied 95 patients, asymptomatic in the ankles and without history of ankle trauma, but with symptomatic medial knee osteoarthritis, participating in an ongoing longitudinal trial. Weightbearing anteroposterior radiographs of the ankle and supine radiographs of the pelvis were assessed, and the narrowest medial and lateral tibiotalar joint space widths and hip joint space widths were measured using Image J software (US NIH, Bethesda, MD). Medial joint space widths were 2. 56  ±  0. 50 and 2. 55  ±  0. 48  mm, and lateral joint space widths were 2. 45  ±  0. 55 and 2. 44  ±  0. 52  mm, for right and left ankle, respectively.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the associations of radiographic and clinical variables <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> osteoarthritis (OA) with alterations in gait and joint loading in patients with secondary hip OA. Fifty females with secondary hip OA were participated. The minimum joint space <b>width</b> (mJSW) <b>of</b> the <b>hip</b> as a degenerative sign and Sharp and center edge (CE) angles as morphological variables were measured radiographically. Hip joint pain was assessed using a visual analog scale. As gait variables, walking speed, range <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> motion, hip moment peak, and hip moment impulse were calculated. Daily cumulative hip loading was calculated as the hip moment impulse multiplied by the mean number of steps per day. After bivariate correlation analyses between dependent (mJSW and pain) and independent variables (age, body mass index, sharp/CE angles, steps per day, and gait variables), separate forward-backward stepwise multiple regression analyses were performed for each dependent variable. Daily cumulative hip loading in the sagittal plane (ß[*]=[*] 0. 30, P[*]=[*] 0. 021) and age (ß[*]=[*]-[*] 0. 36, P[*]=[*] 0. 007) were significantly associated with the mJSW. Walking speed (ß[*]=[*]-[*] 0. 36, P[*]=[*] 0. 008) and age (ß[*]=[*] 0. 29, P[*]=[*] 0. 031) were significantly associated with hip joint pain. Decrease in daily cumulative hip loading in the sagittal plane was associated with mJSW independently of age. Although the causal relationship was not clear, patients with hip OA reduced total exposure to hip joint loading adaptively rather than lowering the hip moment peak concerning worsening <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> degeneration.

Design 428 consecutive patients who were without clinical evidence <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> osteoarthritis (OA) and who underwent supine anteroposterior (AP) pelvic radiography for hip contusion or a routine health check were analyzed for the relation of joint space narrowing to the center-edge (CE) angle, the acetabular depth, the head–neck ratio, the neck-shaft angle, the pelvic width, the height, the body mass index (BMI), gender and age. ResultsThe CE angle was inversely associated with the superomedial JSW and the superolateral JSW. The acetabular depth was positively associated with superomedial JSW. A decreased head–neck ratio and the neck-shaft angle were not associated with the superomedial or superolateral JSW. The height was positively associated with an increased superomedial JSW, but not with the superolateral JSW. The BMI and increased age were positively associated with the superolateral JSW, but not with the superomedial JSW. ConclusionOur study showed that the CE angle was the single constant radiological parameter that was inversely related to the JSW <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> joints. Further, the height was positively related to the superomedial JSW while the BMI was positively related to the superolateral JSW.

DESIGN [...] Retrospective assessment of anteroposterior x ray films of the pelvis. SETTING [...] Radiology department of a rheumatology hospital, New Zealand. PATIENTS [...] Two cohorts of women aged > 60 (mean 70) who were x rayed on the same apparatus in either the 1950 s or the 1990 s. MAIN OUTCOME [...] Length <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> axis (distance from the medial aspect of the pelvis to the lateral aspect of the femur along the axis of the femoral neck), length of femoral neck (length <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> axis excluding the femoral head and more medial structures), and <b>width</b> <b>of</b> femoral neck (see figure). RESULTS [...] Both the mean length <b>of</b> the <b>hip</b> axis and the mean length of the femoral neck were significantly greater in the women whose x ray films were taken in the 1990 s than in those in the 1950 s (124. 0 mm (SE 1) v 130. 5 (1), P = 0. 0002; 79. 4 (1) v 84. 9 (1), P < 0. 0001, respectively). The <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the femoral neck did not change, and the lengths expressed as ratios to width were greater in the more recent x ray films, indicating that these findings are not due to an unrecognised change in radiographic technique. CONCLUSIONS [...] An increase in the length <b>of</b> the <b>hip</b> axis in elderly women in New Zealand during the past 40 years has occurred which is large enough to account for the increase in the age adjusted rate <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> fractures during those years...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveJoint pain {{may cause}} {{patients}} {{to hold their}} limbs in mild flexion, abduction or adduction to minimize pain, regardless {{of the extent of}} articular pathology, and these positional changes may have substantial effects on the interpretation of radiographic joint space. We aimed to study the impacts of minor degrees of flexion, abduction or adduction <b>of</b> the <b>hip,</b> as well as the angle of the x-ray beam on the radiographic joint space <b>width</b> (JSW) <b>of</b> the <b>hip</b> joint. MethodsIn {{the first part of the}} study, 65 patients (44 males, 21 females, mean±SD age 49 ± 17) without clinical evidence <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> osteoarthritis (OA) who underwent intravenous pyelography (IVP) were studied. The hips were differentially positioned during the sequential radiographs required for the IVP procedure. Baseline radiographs were taken at 15 ° internal rotation <b>of</b> the <b>hips</b> [the standard position for anteroposterior (AP) pelvis radiography]; additional positions included the hips at 15 ° and/or 30 ° flexion, and 15 ° adduction and/or 30 ° abduction. Radiographic JSWs were measured at three sites using a dial caliper: superomedial, superolateral, and the point of narrowest JSW. In the second part, 15 patients without clinical evidence <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> OA who underwent supine abdominal radiography for non-rheumatological indications were evaluated by standard (AP) pelvis x-ray in the same setting and JSW measurements were made as described above. ResultsWhen the average of the three measurements of the JSW was taken for each hip, baseline JSW was 4. 38 ± 0. 55 mm (mean±SD). Positioning <b>of</b> the <b>hip</b> significantly (P< 0. 01) affected the radiographic JSW, with apparent widening during adduction and 30 ° flexion, (JSW 4. 56 ± 0. 51 mm and 4. 53 ± 0. 58 mm, mean±SD), respectively, but narrowing during abduction (4. 17 ± 0. 59 mm, mean±SD). Fifteen degree flexion <b>of</b> the <b>hip</b> did not result in statistically significant change in JSW measurements. Upon comparison of the AP pelvis view with the supine abdominal view, neither the average JSW nor the point of narrowest JSW differed significantly, although the superolateral JSW was significantly greater on the AP pelvis view (P= 0. 02). ConclusionsSubtle positional changes in the hip, such as may occur during pain or in OA, may artifactually alter the measured radiographic JSW. Thus, longitudinal studies which employ hip JSW to assess disease progression may yield biased results due to changes in pain rather than structure unless care is taken to ensure constant positioning <b>of</b> the <b>hip...</b>|$|R

The goal {{of the present study was}} to investigate the relationship between the minimal joint space <b>width</b> (JSW) <b>of</b> the <b>hip</b> and the parameters that define acetabular dysplasia, in clinically normal subjects. DesignOne hundred and eighteen patients who underwent supine abdominal radiography for non-rheumatological indications and had no hip pain or history <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> arthritis were evaluated. JSW was quantified manually using dial calipers, and center edge (CE) angle and acetabular depth were measured for each hip. ResultsCE angle, but not acetabular depth, correlated (inversely) with the minimal hip JSW (r=− 0. 26 and − 0. 20, P= 0. 005 and 0. 038, R (right) and L (left) hips, respectively). CE angle inversely correlated with the pelvic width (r=− 0. 27 and 0. 27, P= 0. 003 and 0. 004, R and L hips, respectively) and acetabular depth correlated with subject's height (r= 0. 27 and 0. 42, P= 0. 008 and < 0. 001 R and L hips, respectively) and leg length (r= 0. 27 and 0. 45, P= 0. 008 and < 0. 001, R and L hips, respectively). Also, pelvic width correlated significantly with the JSW (r= 0. 27 and 0. 20, P= 0. 003 and 0. 033, for R and L hips, respectively). ConclusionsThe radiographic parameters {{used to define}} acetabular dysplasia, CE angle and acetabular depth, are strongly associated with anthropological variables and CE angle is associated with minimal JSW <b>of</b> the <b>hip.</b> It is important to recognize that height and limb length variability may affect radiographic parameters of acetabular dysplasia, and thus may falsely suggest the presence of anatomic abnormalities in some patients...|$|R

40|$|Change in {{body weight}} is an {{important}} determinant of risk <b>of</b> osteoporotic <b>hip</b> fracture in aging adults. Weight loss {{has been associated with}} an increased risk <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> fracture and weight gain has been associated with a decreased risk <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> fracture.. Weight gain cannot be recommended as appropriate prevention against hip fracture, however, because it is associated with such adverse health outcomes as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and weight loss is commonly recommended in the treatment of these types of diseases. Clarification of how weight loss is related to risk <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> fracture is needed to resolve this issue. An extensive review of published literature was completed to assess the relationships between hip fracture and body weight, weight change, and involuntary and voluntary weight loss. Change in body weight and weight lll loss that was either intentional or unintentional were then assessed for their effects on risk <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> fracture in a population-based case-control study of risk factors for osteoporotic hip fracture in aging Utah residents. Analyses <b>of</b> risk <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> fracture by quintile of weight change since age 18 and according to weight loss intention were performed through logistic regression modeling.

2500|$|Long-term {{treatment}} with bisphosponates produces anti-fracture and bone mineral density effects that persist for 3–5 years {{after an initial}} 3–5 years of treatment. The bisphosphonate alendronate [...] reduces the risk <b>of</b> <b>hip,</b> vertebral, and wrist fractures by 35-39%; zoledronate reduces the risk <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> fractures by 38% and of vertebral fractures by 62%.

25|$|Breaking, {{also called}} B-boying/B-girling or breakdancing, is a dynamic, rhythmic style of dance which {{developed}} {{as one of}} the major elements <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> hop culture. Like many aspects <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> hop culture, breakdance borrows heavily from many cultures, including 1930s-era street dancing, Brazilian and Asian Martial arts, Russian folk dance, and the dance moves of James Brown, Michael Jackson, and California funk. Breaking took form in the South Bronx in the 1970s alongside the other elements <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> hop. Breakdancing is typically done with the accompaniment <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> hop music playing on a boom box or PA system.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: {{to analyze}} and scientifically {{substantiate}} peculiarities of cause-effect relationship <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> dysplasia in pre-school children. Material and Methods: analysis and systematization of scientific and methodological literature, medical histories, anamneses, interviews and questionings. Results: it is specified that failure to timely identify and eliminate the symptoms <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> dysplasia in pre-school children leads to negative consequences, namely limited amplitude <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> joint movements; lower limp muscle weakness; valgus and varus deformations of lower limp; increasing of L-lordosis; skewness <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> bones; scoliosis; claudication. Conclusions: the modern state of the problem <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> dysplasia in pre-school children is analyzed. The cause-effect relationship is defined, their mutual transition is projected. All cause-effect relationships are in direct proportion and in constant interaction: the cause the forms effect and the effect influences the caus...|$|R
