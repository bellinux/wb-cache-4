50|$|In {{the early}} part of the 19th century, coal ovens were developed. Its shape was {{cylindrical}} and was made of heavy cast-iron. The gas oven saw its first use as early as the beginning of the 19th century as <b>well.</b> <b>Gas</b> stoves became very common household ovens once gas lines were available to most houses and neighborhoods. James Sharp patented one of the first gas stoves in 1826. Other various improvements to the gas stove included the AGA cooker invented in 1922 by Gustaf Dalén. The first electric ovens were invented in the very late 19th century, however, like many electrical inventions destined for commercial use, mass ownership of electrical ovens could not be a reality until better and more efficient use of electricity was available.|$|E
50|$|Further {{development}} led to {{the first}} prototype, built in 1968. The device consisted of a cylindrical shell filled with solid propellant, {{with a number of}} de Laval nozzles installed in the nose cone. The rocket was positioned nose down and the propellant ignited; hot gases escaped through the nozzles at supersonic speeds. Nozzles aimed downwards were responsible for demolition of the ground underneath the rocket; the next series of nozzles, aimed sideways, expanded the drilled <b>well.</b> <b>Gas</b> escaped between the device's shell and the walls of the well at speeds of up to 100 m/s, carrying along chunks of pulverized rock up to 15 cm across. In the process, the gas significantly cooled down through contact with the shaft's walls. Most of the energy contained in the propellant (5 to 100 thousand hp) was spent on the actual digging, while the device lowered itself deeper into the well under its own weight. Tsiferov's device was capable of drilling the well tens of metres deep and 250-1000 mm in diameter, {{depending on the type of}} soil. Experiments have demonstrated that the device is able to drill holes not only in regular soil, but through solid rock, permafrost, ice and aquifers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Analyses of xenon from <b>well</b> <b>gas</b> rich {{in carbon}} dioxide reveal a large excess of radiogenic xenon- 129 from {{the decay of}} extinct iodine- 129. Smaller excesses {{observed}} in the heavy xenon isotopes are from fission. These results place narrow limits on any age difference between {{the earth and the}} oldest meteorites. The occurrence of excess radiogenic xenon- 129 in <b>well</b> <b>gas</b> also suggests that any quantitative degassing of existing solid materials to form the atmosphere must have been limited to a very early period of the earth’s history, approximately the first 10 8 years. Alternatively, this observation is consistent with a model of the earth’s continuous, but still incomplete, degassing since its time of formation. There is unambiguous evidence from several radioactive dating methods that most meteorites formed about 4. 6 × 10 9 years ago (1, 2).

40|$|The {{relationships}} between the major terrestrial volatile reservoirs are explored by resolving the different components in the Xe isotope signatures displayed by Harding County and Caroline CO 2 well gases and mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB). For the nonradiogenic isotopes, there is evidence {{for the presence of}} components enhanced in the light 124 - 128 Xe/ 130 Xe isotope ratios with respect to the terrestrial atmosphere. The observation of small but significant elevations of these ratios in the MORB and <b>well</b> <b>gas</b> reservoirs means that the nonradiogenic Xe in the atmosphere cannot be the primordial base composition in the mantle. The presence of solar-like components, for example U-Xe, solar wind Xe, or both, is required. For radiogenic Xe generated by decay of short-lived 129 I and 244 Pu, the 129 Xerad/ 136 Xe 244 ratios are indistinguishable in MORB and the present atmosphere, but differ by approximately an order of magnitude between the MORB and <b>well</b> <b>gas</b> sources. Correspondence of these ratios in MORB and the atmosphere within the relatively small uncertainties found here significantly constrains possible mantle degassing scenarios. The widely held view that substantial early degassing of 129 Xerad and 136 Xe 244 from the MORB reservoir to the atmosphere occurred and then ended while 129 I was still alive is incompatible with equal ratios, and so is not a possible explanation for observed elevations of 129 Xe/ 130 Xe in MORB compared to the atmosphere. Detailed degassing chronologies constructed from the isotopic composition of MORB Xe are therefore questionable. If the present estimate for the uranium/iodine ratio in the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) is taken to apply to all interior volatile reservoirs, the differing 129 Xerad/ 136 Xe 244 ratios in MORB and the well gases point to two episodes of major mantle degassing, presumably driven by giant impacts, respectively ∼ 20 - 50  Ma and ∼ 95 - 100  Ma after solar system origin assuming current values for initial 129 I/ 127 I and 244 Pu/ 238 U. The earlier time range, for degassing of the <b>well</b> <b>gas</b> source, spans Hf-W calculations for the timing of a moon-forming impact. The second, later impact further outgassed the upper mantle and MORB source. A single event that degassed both the MORB and gas well reservoirs {{at the time of the}} moon-forming collision would be compatible with their distinct 129 Xerad/ 136 Xe 244 ratios only if the post-impact iodine abundance in the MORB reservoir was about an order of magnitude lower than current estimates. In either case, such late dates require large early losses of noble gases, so that initial inventories acquired throughout the Earth must have been substantially higher. The much larger 129 Xerad/ 136 Xe 244 ratio in the well gases compared to MORB requires that these two Xe components evolve from separate interior reservoirs that have been effectively isolated from each other for most of the age of the planet, but are now seen within the upper mantle. These reservoirs have maintained distinct Xe isotope signatures despite having similar Ne isotope compositions that reflect similar degassing histories. This suggests that the light noble gas and radiogenic Xe isotopes are decoupled, with separate long-term storage of the latter. However, without data on the extent of heterogeneities within the upper mantle, this conclusion cannot be easily reconciled with geophysical observations without significant re-evaluation of present noble gas models. Nevertheless the analytic evidence that two different values of 129 Xerad/ 136 Xe 244 exist in the Earth appears firm. If the uranium/iodine ratio is approximately uniform throughout the BSE, it follows that degassing events from separate reservoirs at different times are recorded in the currently available terrestrial Xe data. © 2006 Elsevier B.

30|$|Different {{from the}} concept of {{fracturing}} development in a single coal seam, {{it is not only}} desirable to obtain complex fractured networks in the coal seams, but also to require hydraulic fractures to extend in the vertical direction to communicate gas-bearing layers as much as possible in the co-exploitation of tight sandstone–coal reservoirs. It was found that when the initiation position was located in the coal, it is considerably easier to form complex fractures near the wellbore, which reduces the fracture penetration. At the same time, the formation of coal powder would hamper proppant migration. When the initiation position is located in the sandstone layer, the hydraulic fracture propagated almost along the direction perpendicular to the minimum horizontal stress and connected the neighboring layers more easily. Fracturing practice in the Xuanhua coal field in Hebei Province, China (Li et al. 2014), showed that the hydraulic fracture initiated from a sandstone layer with higher elastic modulus contributes to long fracture height and complex fracture network, effectively reducing the formation of coal powder and multiple fractures near the wellbore and improving the single <b>well</b> <b>gas</b> production.|$|E
