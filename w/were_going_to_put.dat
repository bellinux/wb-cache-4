25|$|A goalkeeper {{can also}} try to {{distract}} the taker by talking to them prior to the penalty being taken. Netherlands national team goalkeeper Tim Krul used this technique during the penalty shootout in the quarter-final match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup against Costa Rica. As the Costa Rican players were preparing to take the kick, Krul told them that he knew where they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> their penalty {{in order to get}} in their heads. This resulted in him saving two penalties and the Netherlands winning the shootout 4-3.|$|E
500|$|As I was {{reporting}} to the Triton, I remember saying, [...] "This ship is an unusual one. We've {{got to do something}} special with it. What could it be?" [...] We talked about it a little bit, and nobody had any ideas. Finally, I got an idea. We'll do a stunt. We'll go around the world from North Pole to South Pole. That was my brainstorm. If {{you take a look at}} a map of the world, you'll see that's not a very easy way to go. [...] So we didn't do that. But I do remember thinking of it. And I made a speech to the crew, advising them of my thinking—that we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> this ship on the map. Well, that died out. Suddenly ... a phone call came, asking me if I could be in Washington tomorrow.|$|E
500|$|Pistons coach Larry Brown {{was not yet}} very concerned, because {{fights in}} the NBA rarely lasted {{for more than a}} few seconds. During the altercation, Artest lay down on the scorer's table to relax while putting on a headset to speak with Pacers radio {{broadcaster}} Mark Boyle. The microphone was not live. Boyle recalled that the broadcasting team knew Artest's personality and [...] "there was no way we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> an open mic in front of [...] in that situation". Pacers president Donnie Walsh later stated that Artest was following advice he had received on how to calm down and avoid trouble in a volatile situation. After unsuccessfully attempting to break up the confrontation, referees prepared to eject various players before the game resumed. Sportscaster Mike Breen, calling the game for ESPN, believed Wallace would be ejected, while Bill Walton was of the opinion that Stephen Jackson should be ejected as well, for shouting at the Pistons players and aggravating the situation. However, Breen expressed concern that, if ejected, Wallace would have to walk past the Pacers bench, which could trigger another incident.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Born Again tour in March 1984, vocalist Ian Gillan left Black Sabbath to re-join Deep Purple, which was reforming after a long hiatus. Bevan left at the same time, and Gillan remarked that he and Bevan were made to feel like [...] "hired help" [...] by Iommi. The band then recruited an unknown Los Angeles vocalist named David Donato. The new line-up wrote and rehearsed throughout 1984, and eventually recorded a demo with producer Bob Ezrin in October. Unhappy with the results, the band parted ways with Donato shortly after. Disillusioned with the band's revolving line-up, bassist Geezer Butler quit Black Sabbath in November 1984 to form a solo band. [...] "When Ian Gillan took over {{that was the end of}} it for me", Butler later said. [...] "I thought it was just a joke and I just totally left. When we got together with Gillan it was not supposed to be a Black Sabbath album. After we had done the album we gave it to Warner Bros. and they said they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it out as a Black Sabbath album and we didn't have a leg to stand on. I got really disillusioned with it and Gillan was really pissed off about it. That lasted one album and one tour and then that was it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{sessions}} were particularly difficult for DeLonge, who suffered chronic back pain. [...] "When your back is killing {{you and you}} have to have surgery and all this stuff, it's just kind of hard to keep a focus on the happier times in your life," [...] he told MTV News. [...] "You end up writing all these songs about feeling sad and confused." [...] He often could only stand and sing for five minutes at a time before having to lay down again. Journalist Joe Shooman writes that the album followed a DIY spirit, rather than spending [...] "months and months refining and polishing everything for a major label and international pop market." [...] DeLonge intended to pay for the project himself, but when an A representative heard four unfinished songs, MCA—the record label Blink-182 was on—wanted to finance the album. DeLonge's manager convinced him it would be a bad idea to pass up someone else paying for its distribution. According to Boukas, an MCA representative dropped in on the sessions and was pleased with what he heard. [...] "When we wrote this album, we didn't know if it was going to be on a label or if we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> it out ourselves," [...] Barker said at the time. [...] "Once MCA jumped on board, it was kind of like, [...] "Whatever! That's cool. Cheers! Put it out, we don't really care!" ...|$|E

[...] In 2013, Kaine said that he agreed that changes to the ACA should be debated, but criticized Republicans for [...] "wrapping them up with the threat" [...] of a federal government shutdown.|$|E

2500|$|The {{band was}} accused by a California {{religious}} group {{and later the}} Parents Music Resource Center of backmasking Satanic messages in their anti-cocaine anthem, [...] "Snowblind". James Young has denied this charge during his introduction for [...] "Snowblind" [...] when played live. Dennis DeYoung has denied the accusation as well, joking on the In the Studio with Redbeard program [...] "we had enough trouble to make the music sound right forward." [...] Also, James Young quotes, [...] "If we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> something Satanic in our songs, we would have put it so {{it was in the}} song forward. Not so you would have to buy some $400 tape recorder to hear it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2012, Heems {{announced}} {{to a crowd}} at the On3 Festival in Munich that Das Racist had broken up. In response, Kool A.D. tweeted that {{he had left the}} band two months prior but had been keeping his departure under wraps. The breakup came after they had signed a record deal and were to release a [...] "proper album", followed by a tour. Dapwell told Spin, “We had a plan to break up around May. We had just signed this record deal and we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> out one proper album and then go on a farewell tour, release a proper breaking up statement that could have been really funny, maybe a weird, stupid video.

2500|$|Prenatal cocaine {{exposure}} (PCE), theorized in the 1970s, {{occurs when}} a pregnant woman uses cocaine and thereby exposes her fetus to the drug. [...] "Crack baby" [...] was a term coined to describe children {{who were exposed to}} crack (freebase cocaine in smokable form) as fetuses; the concept of the crack baby emerged in the US during the 1980s and 1990s {{in the midst of a}} crack epidemic. Other terms are [...] "cocaine baby" [...] and [...] "crack kid". [...] Early studies reported that people who had been exposed to crack in utero would be severely emotionally, mentally, and physically disabled; this belief became common in the scientific and lay communities. Fears were widespread that a generation of crack babies <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> severe strain on society and social services as they grew up. Later studies failed to substantiate the findings of earlier ones that PCE has severe disabling consequences; these earlier studies had been methodologically flawed (e.g. with small sample sizes and confounding factors). Scientists have come to understand that the findings of the early studies were vastly overstated and that most people who were exposed to cocaine in utero do not have disabilities.|$|E

2500|$|Boam, who {{was raised}} Catholic, used many {{religious}} themes and metaphors in his script for the film. In preparing the story, he studied grail literature, but ultimately invented new mythology. He made the grail a symbol for faith. He said, [...] "I guess the major given of faith is that it can't be proved otherwise you don't need faith. So that is why I created {{the idea that the}} grail can't be removed (from its hiding place). You can find the grail, but you can't really prove that you found it." [...] When Indiana Jones finally discovers the grail hidden among decoys, its knight guardian tells him that he will die if he drinks from the wrong cup. Boam said that this scene is a metaphor for [...] "the one true God vs. false gods". He worried that the film's religious themes would face criticism from the general audience, as well as religious scholars. He was relieved when the criticism didn't appear, saying, [...] "Nobody working on this movie was a religious scholar... I was wondering if the numerous allusions to Christ in Indiana Jones <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> people off. I was afraid the kids in the audience would think it was not a very hip subject matter." ...|$|E
