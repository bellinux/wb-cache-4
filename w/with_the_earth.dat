5|$|An annular eclipse {{occurs when}} the Sun and Moon are exactly in line <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> but the {{apparent}} size of the Moon is smaller {{than that of the}} Sun. Hence the Sun appears as a very bright ring, or annulus, surrounding the dark disk of the Moon.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Han dynasty, the Liu family associated its dynasty with the water phase as the previous Qin dynasty had done. By 104 BCE, to accompany the installment of the new Taichu Calendar (太初历), the Han court aligned itself <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> phase to legitimately supplant the Qin's element. Yet by 26 CE (shortly after the downfall of Wang Mang) the new Eastern Han court made a retrospective argument that Han's element had always been fire.|$|E
5|$|In about 65 billion years, it {{estimated}} that the Moon may end up colliding <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> assuming they are not destroyed by the red giant Sun, due to the remaining energy of the Earth–Moon system being sapped by the remnant Sun, causing the Moon to slowly move inwards toward the Earth.|$|E
5|$|In the Kalika Purana, Varaha - Vishnu’s boar avatar - had amorous dalliance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> goddess. He and {{his three}} boar sons then created mayhem in the world, which necessitated Shiva to {{take the form of}} Sharabha, to kill the Varaha form. Even, Vishnu {{requests}} Shiva to destroy Varaha, unable to control his own form. Here, Narasimha appears to aid Varaha. Sharabha kills Narasimha first and then kills Varaha, allowing Vishnu to reabsorb the energies of both his fierce forms. Finally, Vishnu defeats Sharabha.|$|E
25|$|A gyrocompass, {{employed}} for navigation of seagoing vessels, finds the geometric north. It does so, not by sensing <b>the</b> <b>Earth's</b> magnetic field, but by using inertial space as its reference. The outer casing of the gyrocompass device {{is held in}} such a way that it remains aligned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> local plumb line. When the gyroscope wheel inside the gyrocompass device is spun up, the way the gyroscope wheel is suspended causes the gyroscope wheel to gradually align its spinning axis <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth's</b> axis. Alignment <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth's</b> axis is <b>the</b> only direction for which the gyroscope's spinning axis can be stationary <b>with</b> respect to <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> and not be required to change direction with respect to inertial space. After being spun up, a gyrocompass can reach the direction of alignment <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth's</b> axis in as little as a quarter of an hour.|$|R

5|$|It is {{possible}} that many transient phenomena might not {{be associated with the}} Moon itself but could be a result of unfavourable observing conditions or phenomena associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth.</b> For instance, some reported transient phenomena are for objects near the resolution of the employed telescopes. The Earth's atmosphere can give rise to significant temporal distortions that could be confused with actual lunar phenomena (an effect known as astronomical seeing). Other non-lunar explanations include the viewing of Earth-orbiting satellites and meteors or observational error.|$|E
5|$|On {{the fourth}} orbit, {{drifting}} in an inverted spacecraft <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> 'above' him, Schirra continued his photography and attempted—unsuccessfully—to spot the Echo 1 satellite while passing over East Africa. As he approached California, he spoke briefly to John Glenn in a two-minute conversation broadcast live across the United States {{on radio and}} television. Problems began to recur with the pressure suit, with water condensing on the faceplate; Schirra, concerned about the internal temperature, avoided opening the visor to clean it for fear that the suit temperature would misbehave again.|$|E
5|$|A {{partial eclipse}} {{occurs when the}} Sun and Moon are not exactly in line <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> and the Moon only {{partially}} obscures the Sun. This phenomenon can usually be seen from {{a large part of}} the Earth outside of the track of an annular or total eclipse. However, some eclipses can only be seen as a partial eclipse, because the umbra passes above the Earth's polar regions and never intersects the Earth's surface. Partial eclipses are virtually unnoticeable in terms of the sun's brightness, as it takes well over 90% coverage to notice any darkening at all. Even at 99%, it would be no darker than civil twilight. Of course, partial eclipses (and partial stages of other eclipses) can be observed if one is viewing the sun through a darkening filter (which should always be used for safety).|$|E
50|$|A {{geomagnetic}} storm {{is a temporary}} disturbance of <b>the</b> <b>Earth's</b> Magnetosphere caused by a solar wind shock wave and/or cloud of magnetic field that interacts <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth's</b> magnetic field. <b>The</b> increase in solar wind pressure compresses the magnetosphere and the solar wind's magnetic field interacts <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth’s</b> magnetic field to transfer increased energy into the magnetosphere. Both interactions increase plasma movement through the magnetosphere (driven by increased electric fields) {{and an increase in}} electric current in the magnetosphere and ionosphere.|$|R

5|$|Advisors {{are large}} larvae-like creatures which are {{virtually}} featureless, with no visible eyes, ears or limbs, {{though they do}} possess an eye-like mechanical device attached {{to the left side}} of their heads, and detachable mechanical arms. Their faces are covered by a form of respirator, which is able to lift to reveal a mouth-like orifice from which extends a long flexible proboscis. With this, they can examine objects, or attack and kill enemies. Advisors appear to be feeding upon their victim during their attacks. It is implied that Advisors are the original master race behind the Combine, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> administrator Wallace Breen answering directly to them. Although Advisors are usually seen in protective pods guarded by Combine soldiers, they also possess telekinetic powers with which they are able to float through the air and immobilize enemies so that their proboscis can examine their victims without interference. Their appearance was based on the Guild Navigators from the film Dune.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Toho's 1954 film Godzilla, which {{depicted}} a giant dinosaur attacking Tokyo, many Japanese film studios began to produce similar monster films, including Warning from Space. Along with other films such as Shintōhō's Terrifying Attack of the Flying Saucers and the American Forbidden Planet, Warning from Space became part of a fledgling subgenre of films based around science fiction creatures. The film also used the theme of atomic bombs that was present in many films at the time, but showed how the weapons, which devastated the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a decade earlier, could be put to good use. Still others noted the film used another common theme of cosmic collisions {{in the style of}} earlier films such as the 1931 film End of the World, which depicted a comet on a collision course <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Central eclipse {{is often}} used as a generic term for a total, annular, or hybrid eclipse. This is, however, not {{completely}} correct: {{the definition of a}} central eclipse is an eclipse during which the central line of the umbra touches the Earth's surface. It is possible, though extremely rare, that part of the umbra intersects <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> (thus creating an annular or total eclipse), but not its central line. This is then called a non-central total or annular eclipse. The last (umbral yet) non-central solar eclipse was on April 29, 2014. This was an annular eclipse. The next non-central total solar eclipse will be on April 9, 2043.|$|E
50|$|A {{geomagnetic}} storm {{is a temporary}} disturbance of <b>the</b> <b>Earth's</b> magnetosphere caused by a solar wind shock wave and/or cloud of magnetic field that interacts <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth's</b> magnetic field. <b>The</b> increase in the solar wind pressure initially compresses the magnetosphere. The solar wind's magnetic field interacts <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth’s</b> magnetic field and transfers an increased energy into the magnetosphere. Both interactions cause an increase in plasma movement through the magnetosphere (driven by increased electric fields inside the magnetosphere) {{and an increase in}} electric current in the magnetosphere and ionosphere.|$|R

5|$|In the ocean, Varaha {{encounters}} Hiranyaksha, who obstructs {{his path}} and challenges {{him to a}} duel. In some versions, the demon also mocks Varaha as the beast and warns him not to touch earth. Ignoring the demon's threats, Varaha lifts the earth on his tusks. Hiranyaksha charges towards the boar in rage with a mace. The two fiercely fight with maces. Finally, Varaha slays the demon after a thousand-year duel. Varaha rises from the ocean <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> in his tusks and places her gently above it in her original position, as the gods and the sages sing Varaha's praises.|$|E
5|$|Inside the {{magnetosphere}} is the plasmasphere, a donut-shaped region containing low-energy charged particles, or plasma. This region {{begins at}} {{a height of}} 60km, extends up to 3 or 4 Earth radii, and includes the ionosphere. This region rotates <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth.</b> There are also two concentric tire-shaped regions, called the Van Allen radiation belts, with high-energy ions (energies from 0.1 to 10million electron volts (MeV)). The inner belt is 1–2Earth radii out while the outer belt is at 4–7Earth radii. The plasmasphere and Van Allen belts have partial overlap, with the extent of overlap varying greatly with solar activity.|$|E
5|$|The tree {{has survived}} {{for so long}} due to {{vegetative}} cloning. The visible tree is relatively young, but {{it is part of}} an older root system that dates back thousands of years. The trunk of the tree may die and regrow multiple times, but the tree's root system remains intact and in turn sprouts another trunk. The trunk may only live for about 600 years, and when one trunk dies another eventually grows back in its place. Also, each winter, heavy snow may push the tree's low-lying branches to ground level, where they take root and survive to grow again the next year in a process known as layering. Layering occurs when a tree's branch comes in contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth,</b> and new roots sprout from the contact point. Other trees, such as coast redwoods and western redcedars are known to reproduce by layering. The tree's age was determined by carbon-14 dating of the root system, which found roots dating back to 375, 5,660, 9,000, and 9,550 years. Carbon dating is not accurate enough to pin down the exact year the tree sprouted from seed; but, given the estimated age, the tree is supposed to have sprouted around 7550 BC. For comparison, the invention of writing (and thus, the beginning of recorded history) did not occur until around 4000 BC. Researchers have found a cluster of around 20 spruce trees in the same area, all over 8,000 years old.|$|E

50|$|The {{reason the}} {{rotation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> {{in relation to the}} pendulum swing increases in time (decreases in effect) with decreasing latitude is related to the Coriolis Effect.

The Coriolis effect decreases nearer the equator because the surface of <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> is parallel to the axis of rotation (the central axis of the pendulum is perpendicular <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth's</b> axis of rotation).
