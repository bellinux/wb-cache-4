5|$|The {{music for}} Flower {{was created by}} Vincent Diamante, a video game music {{composer}} and professor at the University of Southern California's Interactive Media Division. He had previously scored the music for Cloud, Chen's first game, and Dyadin <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> at the University of Southern California. He worked directly with the development team to integrate the music into the game by adjusting the placements of flowers and the tones that each type played when they were reached. He did this by harmonizing the gameplay with the music, and adjusting the music dynamically to correspond {{to changes in the}} game world. Diamante used his music to influence the development team in adapting ideas he had for the game.|$|E
5|$|Hoshino enjoyed drawing Lenalee's hair, despite {{finding her}} D.Gray-man {{character}} Yu Kanda's hair impossible to top. She enjoyed drawing Lenalee {{because of her}} personality, and her relationship with other series' characters such as Komui and Reever Wenhamm. Because her hair grew longer as the series went on, the author gave her different hairstyles. When the manga moved to Jump Square, a magazine for older readers, Hoshino decided to increase Lenalee's sex appeal by having her skirt shorter {{even though she is}} also wearing shorts beneath it. After Allen Walker became a fugitive from the Order, Hoshino wanted to have Lenalee chase after him, {{to the point where they}} would clash. When asked about Allen's farewell hug with Lenalee as he leaves the Order, Hoshino joked that she was happy with how Lenalee had matured, and at the same time become taller than Allen, in contrast to the beginning of the series <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> the same height.|$|E

5|$|Hugo Spadafora was a {{physician}} and political activist who had first clashed with Noriega <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>both</b> members of Torrijo's government. Though an ally of Torrijos, he and Noriega had been personal enemies for a long time. Despite not {{being a member of}} the opposition, he became a vocal critic of Noriega after returning to Panama from Guatemala in 1981. Spadafora amassed evidence of corruption within the government by using his position as an ally of Torrijos to question Noriega's allies, including Rodriquez and Carlton. This included a lengthy conversation with Carlton in mid-1985 after his drug operations had collapsed due to conflicts over a missing shipment, and he had received negative publicity in the Panamanian press. In September 1985 he accused Noriega of having connections to drug trafficking and announced his intent to return to Panama to oppose him. The drug trafficking charges threatened Noriega's support among his own constituency of middle class individuals who had benefited under his and Torrijos' government.|$|E
