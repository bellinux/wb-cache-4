5|$|A {{northern}} {{route of}} retreat {{had too many}} obstacles, so Hunter's force retreated westward toward Charleston—with the Confederate army in pursuit. On June 19, the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry was the rear guard. The regiment often had to fight dismounted. Averell's entire division fought for two hours near Liberty. His cavalry division fought until its ammunition <b>was</b> <b>exhausted,</b> and then was relieved by Crook's infantry. Averell lost 122 men.|$|E
50|$|City walls enter play {{once the}} first pile <b>is</b> <b>exhausted.</b> Whenever a feature is scored, walls {{are added to}} the board. The first player to score after the first pile <b>is</b> <b>exhausted</b> places the city gate next to any tile, and {{thereafter}} all players must place a wall segment such that it is adjacent to a tile and to other wall segments (or the city gate). Wall segments prevent tiles to be placed beyond the wall, and also serve to complete features. After the second pile <b>is</b> <b>exhausted,</b> each player places two wall segments. In a two-player game, two wall segments are placed instead of one after the first pile <b>is</b> <b>exhausted,</b> and four wall segments are placed instead of two after the second pile <b>is</b> <b>exhausted.</b>|$|R

5|$|At {{the time}} it was thought that Alpha was the twenty-second storm of the season, and so was the storm which broke the 1933 season's record for most storms in a single season. However post-season {{analysis}} revealed that there was also a previously unnoticed subtropical storm on October4, which made Alpha the twenty-third storm of the season. Alpha was the first tropical storm to be assigned a Greek-alphabet name after the list of hurricane names <b>was</b> <b>exhausted.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Luna had {{previously}} created comics {{with his brother}} Joshua, but <b>was</b> <b>exhausted</b> after six straight years of work.

5|$|Beginning {{early in}} 1893, {{a number of}} {{industrial}} firms, including the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad and the National Cordage Company went bankrupt. The resulting bank runs and failures {{became known as the}} Panic of 1893. In June of that year, President Grover Cleveland, who believed that the Panic was caused by the inflation generated by the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, called a special session of Congress in order to repeal it. The act was repealed on November 1, 1893. On June 13, 1898, Congress ordered the coining of all the remaining bullion purchased under the Sherman Silver Purchase Act into silver dollars. Silver dollar production rose again, until the bullion <b>was</b> <b>exhausted</b> in 1904, when it ceased.|$|E
5|$|By December 1974, Lennon and Pang {{considered}} {{buying a}} house together, and he refused to accept Ono's phone calls. The next month, Lennon agreed to meet with Ono, {{who claimed to have}} found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable, because he <b>was</b> <b>exhausted</b> after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment with Pang; he was stupefied and confused {{to such an extent that}} Pang believed he had been brainwashed. He told her that his separation from Ono was now over, though Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of World War I, the easy-to-reach gold <b>was</b> <b>exhausted</b> and Fairbanks' {{population}} plunged as miners moved to promising finds at Ruby and Iditarod. Construction of the Alaska Railroad caused a surge of economic activity and allowed heavy equipment to be brought in for further exploitation of Fairbanks' gold deposits. Enormous gold dredges were built north of Fairbanks, and the city grew throughout the 1930s {{as the price of}} gold rose during the Great Depression. A further boom came during the 1940s and 1950s as the city became a staging area for construction of military depots during World War II and {{the first decade of the}} Cold War.|$|E

5|$|In 1840 a {{group of}} local {{businessmen}} led by Jonathan Richardson set up {{the first of several}} iron companies in Consett (County Durham), the Derwent Iron Company, to quarry and smelt ironstone around the town. The best local ironstone (with the highest iron content) <b>was</b> <b>exhausted</b> soon after, so the company arranged for extensions to the local railways, such as the Stockton and Darlington Railway. These allowed it to access new sources of ironstone, including, from 1851 onwards, ore from the Cleveland Ironstone Formation near Eston, Cleveland.|$|E
5|$|In April 2008, {{following}} the successful discovery of HMAS Sydney, several parties began {{calling for a}} dedicated search for Centaur. By the end of 2008, the Australian Federal and Queensland State governments had formed a joint committee and contributed A$2 million each towards a search, and tenders to supply equipment (including the search vessel, side-scan sonar systems, and a remotely operated inspection submersible) were opened in February 2009, and awarded during the year. The search, conducted from the Defence Maritime Services vessel Seahorse Spirit and overseen by shipwreck hunter David Mearns, commenced during the weekend of 12–13 December 2009. The initial search area off Cape Moreton covered , with the search team given 35 days to locate and film the wreck before funding <b>was</b> <b>exhausted.</b>|$|E
5|$|One of {{the classic}} account of slaves that escaped on the Underground Railroad was Harriet Beecher Stowe's fictional work, Uncle Tom's Cabin, which relates the story of Eliza Harris, a young slave girl who escaped the South by {{crossing}} the Ohio River on a winter night. Barefooted and carrying her baby, the fictional Eliza <b>was</b> <b>exhausted</b> and nearly dead when she reached safety. After receiving food, clothing, new shoes, and shelter from Stowe's fictional Quaker couple, Simeon and Rachael Halliday, Eliza continued her journey to freedom in Canada. Stow, who {{was living in the}} city at the time, was acquainted with the Coffins, who may have been the inspiration for the Halliday couple in her novel.|$|E

5|$|Rhyolite {{declined}} {{almost as}} rapidly as it rose. After the richest ore <b>was</b> <b>exhausted,</b> production fell. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the financial panic of 1907 {{made it more difficult}} to raise development capital. In 1908, investors in the Montgomery Shoshone Mine, concerned that it was overvalued, ordered an independent study. When the study's findings proved unfavorable, the company's stock value crashed, further restricting funding. By the end of 1910, the mine was operating at a loss, and it closed in 1911. By this time, many out-of-work miners had moved elsewhere, and Rhyolite's population dropped well below 1,000. By 1920, it was close to zero.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 primary was {{so close}} it forced a recount and {{prompted}} a lawsuit. When Ohio Secretary of State Bob Taft dismissed Miller's charges of voting irregularities in Highland, Hocking and Warren counties, Miller filed suit in the Ohio Supreme Court. Miller dropped his court challenge in August and then only because his campaign treasury <b>was</b> <b>exhausted.</b> In the final count, McEwen won 33,219 votes to Miller's 32,922, a plurality of 297 votes. In the end, McEwen's geographic advantage (he retained 59% of his old territory) put him over the top. Ominously, however, Miller trounced him in the five counties {{that had been in}} Miller's old district.|$|E
5|$|The Cagneys had run-of-the-play contracts, {{which lasted}} {{as long as}} the play did. Vernon was in the chorus line of the show, and with help from the Actors' Equity Association, Cagney understudied Tracy on the Broadway show, {{providing}} them with a desperately needed steady income. Cagney also established a dance school for professionals, then landed a part in the play Women Go On Forever, directed by John Cromwell, which ran for four months. By the end of the run, Cagney <b>was</b> <b>exhausted</b> from acting and running the dance school.|$|E

5|$|The Union counteroffensive never came; the Army of the Potomac <b>was</b> <b>exhausted</b> {{and nearly}} as damaged {{at the end}} of the three days as the Army of Northern Virginia. Meade was content to hold the field. On July 4, the armies {{observed}} an informal truce and collected their dead and wounded. Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant accepted the surrender of the Vicksburg garrison along the Mississippi River, splitting the Confederacy in two. These two Union victories are generally considered the turning point of the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|A counterattack to {{take back}} the {{airfield}} and Point 107 was organised for the following day at Hargest's headquarters. He <b>was</b> <b>exhausted</b> and had to take a quick nap before a conference to work out detailed plans for the counter-attack, much to the disgust of some of the other participants. Afterwards, he became pessimistic of the chances of success and unsuccessfully sought to have the attack called off. The attack did fail but Hargest, still well behind the frontlines, mistakenly believed it to be going well until he found that his brigade had returned to their starting positions. His pessimism began to affect Puttick, who asked Freyberg to allow the 5th Infantry Brigade to withdraw, which it duly did. This began an eventual retreat and evacuation from Crete on 31 May, with Hargest flying out for Egypt by seaplane, his brigade following by sea.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hydrogen}} fuel {{at the core}} of the progenitor of IK Pegasi B was consumed, it evolved into a red giant. The inner core contracted until hydrogen burning commenced in a shell surrounding the helium core. To compensate for the temperature increase, the outer envelope expanded to many times the radius it possessed as a main sequence star. When the core reached a temperature and density where helium could start to undergo fusion this star contracted and became what is termed a horizontal branch star. That is, it belonged to a group of stars that fall upon a roughly horizontal line on the H-R diagram. The fusion of helium formed an inert core of carbon and oxygen. When helium <b>was</b> <b>exhausted</b> in the core a helium-burning shell formed in addition to {{the hydrogen}}-burning one and the star moved to what astronomers term the asymptotic giant branch, or AGB. (This is a track leading to the upper-right corner of the H-R diagram.) If the star had sufficient mass, in time carbon fusion could begin in the core, producing oxygen, neon and magnesium.|$|E
