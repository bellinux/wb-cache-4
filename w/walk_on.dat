5|$|Cernan {{turned down}} the {{opportunity}} to <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> the Moon as Lunar Module Pilot of Apollo 16, preferring to risk missing a flight altogether {{for the opportunity to}} command his own mission. After the cancellation of Apollo 18, NASA decided to send a scientist, Harrison Schmitt, to the Moon. This decision meant the original Lunar Module (LM) pilot, Joe Engle, never had the opportunity to <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> the Moon. Cernan fought to keep his crew together; however, public pressure from the scientific community cemented Schmitt's position on the crew. Even though Cernan wanted to keep his crew together, he had a positive evaluation of Schmitt's abilities. For example, he believed Schmitt was an outstanding LM pilot and that Engle was merely an adequate one.|$|E

Most bovids exhibit sexual dimorphism, with males usually larger as well as heavier than females. Sexual dimorphism is more prominent in medium- to large-sized bovids. All bovids have four toes on each foot – they <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> the central two (the hooves), while the outer two (the dewclaws) are much smaller and rarely touch the ground.|$|E

A few insects have evolved to <b>walk</b> <b>on</b> the surface of the water, especially members of the Gerridae family, commonly known as water striders. A few species of ocean-skaters in the genus Halobates even live on the surface of open oceans, a habitat that has few insect species.|$|E

This paper explores similar <b>walks</b> <b>on</b> complex hyperplane arrangements. This is achieved by involving certain cell complexes naturally associated with the arrangement. In a particular case this leads to <b>walks</b> <b>on</b> libraries with several shelves. We also show that interval greedoids give rise to random walks belonging to the same general family. Members of this family of Markov chains, based on certain semigroups, have the property that all eigenvalues of the transition matrices are non-negative real and given by a simple combinatorial formula.

5|$|Construction was of crossed wooden poles, {{driven into}} the {{waterlogged}} soil to support a walkway that consisted mainly of planks of oak, laid end-to-end. The track was used {{for a period of}} only around ten years and was then abandoned, probably due to rising water levels. Following its discovery in 1970, most of the track has been left in its original location, with active conservation measures taken, including a water pumping and distribution system to maintain the wood in its damp condition. Some of the track is stored at the British Museum and at the Museum of Somerset in Taunton.
