5|$|In {{the area}} around Green Lake there are forests of pecan, black willow, cedar, American elm, {{hackberry}} and green ash. To the south, the Guadalupe Delta Wildlife Management Area serves as a wetland habitat for thousands of permanent egrets, and other birds, including the brown pelican, reddish egret, <b>white-faced</b> <b>ibis,</b> wood stork, bald eagle, white-tailed hawk, peregrine falcon, and the whooping crane. American alligators reside in the area as well.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, $1 {{million of}} federal {{stimulus}} money was delegated to {{the restoration of}} the marshland near the Nueces Bay Causeway to increase the population of birds and fish. The Coastal Bend Bays and Estuaries Program and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service collaborated to place soil and plant marsh near the causeway to allow a larger nursing location for fish and provide greater quantities of food for water birds. Over 490 species of birds have been found in the area including the brown pelican, black-billed whistling duck, reddish egret, <b>white-faced</b> <b>ibis,</b> pauraque, buff-bellied hummingbird, golden-fronted woodpecker, long-billed thrasher, olive sparrow, Neotropic cormorant, laughing gull, Franklin's gull, ring-billed gull, herring gull, gull-billed tern, common loon, brown-crested flycatcher, hooded oriole, peregrine falcon and piping plover. Bird populations are protected and can be viewed at the Hans and Pat Suter Wildlife Refuge on Oso Bay.|$|E
5|$|The high {{salinity}} {{in parts}} of the lake makes them uninhabitable for all but a few species, including brine shrimp, brine flies, and several forms of algae. The brine flies have an estimated population of over one hundred billion and serve as the main source of food for many of the birds which migrate to the lake. However, the fresh- and salt-water wetlands along the eastern and northern edges of the Great Salt Lake provide critical habitat for millions of migratory shorebirds and waterfowl in western North America. These marshes account for approximately 75% of the wetlands in Utah. Some of the birds that depend on these marshes include: Wilson's phalarope, red-necked phalarope, American avocet, black-necked stilt, marbled godwit, snowy plover, western sandpiper, long-billed dowitcher, tundra swan, American white pelican, <b>white-faced</b> <b>ibis,</b> California gull, eared grebe, peregrine falcon, bald eagle, plus large populations of various ducks and geese.|$|E
5000|$|Sources dated 1987 and 1996 {{suggest that}} bird species are the {{dominant}} fauna. [...] As of 1980 and 1981, the following bird species were observed on Busby Islet: Australian pelican, black-faced shag, little pied cormorant, little black cormorant, pied cormorant, <b>white-faced</b> heron, sacred <b>ibis,</b> chestnut teal, black swan, brown falcon, grey plover, pied oystercatcher, sooty oystercatcher, ruddy turnstone, silver gull, pacific gull, caspian tern, fairy tern, crested tern, sharp-tailed sandpiper, red-necked stint, curlew sandpiper, eastern curlew, whimbrel, greenshank, rock parrot, raven and little grassbird.|$|R
2500|$|Opened in 1991, the Africa Rainforest exhibit covers [...] and {{was built}} {{at a cost}} of $4.3 million. In {{addition}} to animals, the exhibit includes artwork and the Kongo Ranger Station, a mock up of a safari expedition. Animals in the exhibit include Rodriguez fruit bats, straw-colored fruit bats, Egyptian fruit bats, colobus monkeys, Allen's swamp monkey, hadada <b>ibis,</b> <b>white-faced</b> whistling ducks, slender-snouted crocodile, Nile monitor lizard, lungfish, cichlids, lesser flamingos, geckos, chameleons, African crested porcupines, African clawed frogs, and hooded vultures. The rainforest includes four main areas: the Bamba Du Jon Swamp, which houses the lungfish, cichlids, frogs and reptiles; the rainforest aviary, which houses the birds; the monkey habitat which houses the monkeys and chameleon; and the bat habitat.|$|R
25|$|The {{wetlands}} {{surrounding the}} Great Salt Lake {{account for nearly}} 80% of the wetlands in Utah. The lake and surrounding wetlands are home to over 250 species of birds and form a stop over on the Pacific Flyway between South and North America. Between four and six million birds nest and feed on the lake every year. The worlds largest populations of <b>white-faced</b> <b>ibis</b> and California gulls make their homes near the lake. A large population of black-necked stilts, American avocets and newborn pelicans are also found on and near the Great Salt Lake. Many of the birds come to Antelope Island State Park to feed on the abundant quantities of brine flies and brine shrimp.|$|E
500|$|Copano Bay {{serves as}} a nursery for shrimp, which attracts {{a large number of}} redfish. Abundant {{collections}} of black drum, flounder and trout, can also be found in the bay. Oysters grow in large numbers to form elongated reefs [...] "oriented perpendicular to tidal flow" [...] in the estuary. The reefs provide habitat for fish and sustenance {{for a wide variety of}} birds including the black-bellied whistling-duck, black-necked stilt, brown pelican, gull-billed tern, reddish egret, roseate spoonbill, seaside sparrow, <b>white-faced</b> <b>ibis</b> and the whooping crane. The dominant species of gastropod in the bay is Eulimastoma harbisonae.|$|E
500|$|Many birds {{migrate to}} the area around Aransas Bay, most notably to the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge.

[...] The endangered whooping crane has also been spotted near the bay. Despite {{the fact that there}} were only 15 in 1900, over 180 are found in the wild today. The whooping crane's and other birds' survival depends on the availability of blue crab. Thousands of crab traps have been removed to preserve the population.|$|E

2500|$|Fish cannot {{survive in}} the lake {{because of the high}} {{salinity}} and alkali content; as a consequence, brine shrimp are abundant. [...] As a result, the lake provides an excellent habitat for a variety of shore birds. It is one of Oregon’s few inland nesting sites for snowy plovers. The lake is also a stop on the Pacific flyway for many migrant bird species. During the annual migrations, it hosts tens of thousands of eared grebes, Wilson's phalaropes, red-necked phalaropes, American avocets, killdeer, and northern shovelers. [...] black terns, Forster's terns, American avocet, <b>white-faced</b> <b>ibis,</b> Clark's grebes, and black-necked stilts are common during the summer months.

50|$|The <b>white-faced</b> <b>ibis</b> bears {{a strong}} {{resemblance}} to the related glossy ibis {{and in the past}} was sometimes considered to be a subspecies of the glossy ibis. Another theory was that upon coming to the New World, a small isolated glossy ibis population evolved to become its own separate species. However, recent molecular phylogenetic studies show that the <b>white-faced</b> <b>ibis</b> may actually be paraphyletic. In fact, members of the <b>white-faced</b> <b>ibis</b> populations in the United States appear to be more closely related to glossy ibises than to members of <b>white-faced</b> <b>ibis</b> populations in Southern Brazil.|$|E
