5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{philosophers}} of diverse orientations have challenged many of Fodor's ideas. For example, the language of thought hypothesis {{has been accused of}} either falling prey to an infinite regress or of being superfluous. Specifically, Simon Blackburn suggested in an article in 1984 that since Fodor explains the learning of natural languages as a process of formation and confirmation of hypotheses in the LOT, this leaves him open to the question of why the LOT itself should not be considered as just such a language which requires yet another and more fundamental representational substrate in which to form and confirm hypotheses so that the LOT itself can be learned. If natural language learning requires some representational substrate (the LOT) in order for it to be learned, why shouldn't the same be said for the LOT itself and then for the representational substrate of this representational substrate and so on, ad infinitum? On the other hand, if such a representational substrate is not required for the LOT, then <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> be required for the learning of natural languages? In this case, the LOT would be superfluous. Fodor, in response, argues that the LOT is unique in that it {{does not have to be}} learned via an antecedent language because it is innate.|$|E
500|$|The release {{also drew}} criticism. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, who {{independently}} released his sixth album Ghosts I-IV under a Creative Commons licence the following year, thought {{it did not}} go far enough, calling it [...] "very much a bait and switch, {{to get you to}} pay for a MySpace-quality stream as a way to promote a very traditional record sale." [...] Singer Lily Allen called it [...] "arrogant", saying: [...] " [...] millions of pounds. It sends a weird message to younger bands who haven't done as well. You don't choose how to pay for eggs. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> be different for music?" [...] In the Guardian, journalist Will Hodgkinson wrote: [...] "Spare a thought for the thousands upon thousands of bands and singers who, nowhere near Radiohead's levels of fame and fortune, now have pretty much no chance of ever making a living from their music." [...] Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth told the Guardian the release [...] "seemed really community-oriented, but it wasn't catered towards their musician brothers and sisters, who don’t sell as many records as them. It makes everyone else look bad for not offering their music for whatever." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics such as Malcolm Cowley and Delmore Schwartz {{describe}} {{mixed emotions}} about the religiosity of the poem. Cowley emphasised the mystical {{nature of the}} poem and how its themes were closer to Buddhism than Anglicanism while mentioning his appreciation {{of many of the}} passages. Schwartz also mentioned the Buddhist images and his admiration for many of the lines in Little Gidding. F. B. Pinion believed that the fourth section of the poem caused [...] "Eliot more trouble and vexation than any passage of the same length he ever wrote, and is his greatest achievement in the Four Quartets." [...] E. M. Forster did not like Eliot's emphasis on pain and responded to the poem: [...] "Of course there's pain on and off through each individual's life... You can't shirk it and so on. But <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> be endorsed by the schoolmaster and sanctified by the priest until the fire and the rose are one when so much of it is caused by disease and bullies? It is here that Eliot becomes unsatisfactory as a seer." [...] Writing in 2003, Roger Scruton wrote that in [...] "Little Gidding" [...] Eliot achieved [...] "that for which he envies Dante—namely, a poetry of belief, in which belief and words are one, and in which the thought cannot be prized free from the controlled and beautiful language".|$|E

2500|$|The {{closest thing}} to a title track on the album {{concerns}} itself with a livid God, who has seen the multitude of religious wars fought in his many names and has sent his right hand, The Thorn, an avenging angel of death, to mete out a collective punishment. If the concept of an all-encompassing God is to be believed, then <b>why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> not be also believed that his will could turn grim and 'old testament' on the self-professed prophets who war in his name? [...] "I Am the Thorn" [...] is a song about the dire consequences of waging war in the name of religion and territory.|$|E
2500|$|Following this speech, the Illinois {{delegation}} (led by Jacob Arvey) {{announced that}} they would place Stevenson's name in nomination, and Stevenson called President Truman to ask if [...] "he would be embarrassed" [...] if Stevenson formally announced his candidacy for the nomination. Truman told Stevenson [...] "I have been trying since January {{to get you to}} say that. <b>Why</b> <b>should</b> <b>it</b> embarrass me?" [...] Kefauver led on the first ballot, but was well below the vote total he needed to win. Stevenson gradually gained strength until he was nominated on the third ballot. Historian John Frederick Martin says party leaders selected him because he was [...] "more moderate on civil rights than Estes Kefauver, yet nonetheless acceptable to labor and urban machines—so a coalition of southern, urban, and labor leaders fell in behind his candidacy in Chicago." [...] Stevenson's 1952 running mate was Senator John Sparkman of Alabama.|$|E
