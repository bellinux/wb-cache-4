These cells (called epithem cells) open out into one or more sub-epidermal chambers. These, in turn, communicate with the exterior through an open <b>water</b> <b>stoma</b> or open pore. The <b>water</b> <b>stoma</b> structurally resembles an ordinary stoma, but is usually larger and has lost the power of movement.|$|E
