5|$|Meanwhile, back in England, Brock's brother William faced {{financial}} difficulties, as {{the bank}} {{in which he was}} a senior partner failed. Isaac's commissions had been purchased with a loan entered into the bank's books by his brother, and the Brocks faced a demand for payment. Isaac could not meet the £3000 debt, but made over the whole of his salary to his brother Irving, to be used for <b>whatever</b> <b>was</b> considered most critical: his commission debt or the family's other bills.|$|E
5|$|Perry Como {{never forgot}} Canonsburg either. One {{of the things}} he did to give a helping hand to his home town was to {{convince}} RCA to open a record-pressing plant there.

5|$|When Mardonius {{learned of}} the Spartan force, he {{completed}} the destruction of Athens, tearing down <b>whatever</b> <b>was</b> left standing. He then retreated towards Thebes, hoping to lure the Greek army into territory that would be suitable for the Persian cavalry. Mardonius created a fortified encampment on the north bank of the Asopus river in Boeotia covering the ground from Erythrae past Hysiae {{and up to the}} lands of Plataea.|$|E
5|$|The kingdom proper, {{that is the}} Jaffna peninsula, {{was divided}} into various provinces with subdivisions of parrus meaning {{property}} or larger territorial units and ur or villages, the smallest unit, was administered on a hierarchical and regional basis. At the summit was the king whose kingship was hereditary; he was usually succeeded by his eldest son. Next in the hierarchy stood the adikaris who were the provincial administrators. Then came the mudaliyars who functioned as judges and interpreters of the laws and customs of the land. It was also their duty to gather information of <b>whatever</b> <b>was</b> happening in the provinces and report to higher authorities. Administrators of revenues called kankanis or superintendents and kanakkappillais or accountants came next in line. These were also known as pandarapillai. They had to keep records and maintain accounts.|$|E
5|$|The team {{entered the}} season {{surrounded}} by questions {{of how they}} would overcome the late season collapse from last year and {{what it would take}} for Rich Rodriguez to return for a fourth year. On January 5, Michigan hired Dave Brandon to replace Bill Martin as its athletic director. Martin had previously announced his retirement during the 2009 season. Reaction to the hire was positive, but the hire also brought increased scrutiny upon Rich Rodriguez, as Brandon {{made it clear that he}} would do <b>whatever</b> <b>was</b> necessary to turn the program around from its recent slump.|$|E

Similar to another parlor game, the guest is given a personalized list of three things - usually something personal, like characters they've played, musicians they like, or favorite ball players - and the guest has to Start one, Bench one and Cut one. <b>Whatever</b> <b>is</b> 'Started' is in the lineup everyday. <b>Whatever</b> <b>is</b> 'Benched' is available for the lineup occasionally. <b>Whatever</b> <b>is</b> 'Cut' is sent far away and has no part in the future.|$|R

5|$|If the German {{air force}} had prevailed and {{attempted}} a landing, a much-reduced Royal Air Force {{would have been}} obliged to operate from airfields {{well away from the}} southeast of England. Any airfield that was in danger of being captured would have been made inoperable and there were plans to remove all portable equipment from vulnerable radar bases and completely destroy anything that could not be moved. <b>Whatever</b> <b>was</b> left of the RAF would have been committed to intercepting the invasion fleet in concert with the Royal Navy—to fly in the presence of an enemy that enjoys air superiority is very dangerous. However, the RAF would have kept several advantages, such as being able to operate largely over friendly territory, as well as having the ability to fly for longer as, until the Germans were able to operate from airfields in England, Luftwaffe pilots would still have to fly significant distances to reach their operational area.|$|E
5|$|The Sandomierz {{articles}} {{produced by}} the rebels were concerned mostly with placing further limitations on the monarch's power. Threatened by royal forces under Stanisław Żółkiewski, the confederates entered into an agreement with Sigismund, but then backed {{out of it and}} demanded the King's deposition. The ensuing civil war was resolved at the Battle of Guzów, where the szlachta was defeated in 1607. Afterwards however magnate leaders of the pro-King faction made sure that Sigismund's position would remain precarious, leaving arbitration powers within the Senate's competence. <b>Whatever</b> <b>was</b> left of the execution movement had become thwarted together with the obstructionist szlachta elements, and a compromise solution to the crisis of authority was arrived at. But the victorious lords of the council had at their disposal no effective political machinery necessary to propagate the well-being of the Commonwealth, still in its Golden Age (or as some prefer Silver Age now), much further.|$|E

25|$|Hackman {{struck up}} a {{friendship}} with Martha Ray (who was several years older than he was) and was later reported to have become besotted with her.

However, <b>whatever</b> <b>was</b> between Hackman and Martha Ray ended when he was posted to Ireland.|$|E
25|$|According to John Dominic Crossan, Jesus {{sent his}} disciples out to heal and to {{proclaim}} the Kingdom of God. They were {{to eat with}} those they healed rather than with higher status people who might well be honored to host a healer, and Jesus directed them to eat <b>whatever</b> <b>was</b> offered them. This implicit challenge to the social hierarchy was part of Jesus' program of radical egalitarianism. These themes of healing and eating are common in early Christian art.|$|E

25|$|The {{area was}} then conquered by Rome in the 160s BC, and {{incorporated}} into the Roman province of Illyricum in 59 BC. Subsequently, it became part of Moesia Superior in AD 87.

Wellington advocated the view that all cavalry should be capable of doing <b>whatever</b> <b>was</b> required ‘be they dressed or armed as they may’. Despite such opinions, the distinction between heavy and light regiments was generally maintained.|$|E
25|$|The {{diplomatic}} intrigue failed, {{largely due}} to the intervention of Sophia's mother, Johanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp. Historical accounts portray her as a cold, abusive woman who loved gossip and court intrigues. Johanna's hunger for fame centred on her daughter's prospects of becoming empress of Russia, but she infuriated Empress Elizabeth, who eventually banned her from the country for spying for King Frederick of Prussia. The Empress Elizabeth knew the family well: she had intended to marry Princess Johanna's brother Charles Augustus (Karl August von Holstein), who had died of smallpox in 1727 before the wedding could take place. In spite of Johanna's interference, Empress Elizabeth took a strong liking to the daughter, who, on arrival in Russia in 1744, spared no effort to ingratiate herself not only with the Empress Elizabeth, but with her husband and with the Russian people. She applied herself to learning the Russian language with such zeal, she rose at night and walked about her bedroom barefoot, repeating her lessons (even though she mastered the language, she retained an accent). This led to a severe attack of pneumonia in March 1744. When she wrote her memoirs, she said she made up her mind when she came to Russia to do <b>whatever</b> <b>was</b> necessary, and to profess to believe <b>whatever</b> <b>was</b> required of her, to become qualified to wear the crown.|$|E
25|$|The last {{condition}} is mentioned by Polybius {{in place of}} the one regarding not making war on Syracuse. It is possible that Hamilcar Barca secured the last clause after the initial conditions, which were more favorable to Carthage, was altered by Rome with a harsher one. Hamilcar Barca gathered the Carthaginian soldiers from Drepana and Eryx at Lilybaeum, surrendered his command, returned to Carthage and retired to private life, leaving Gisco and the Carthaginian government to pay off his soldiers. <b>Whatever</b> <b>was</b> the motivation behind this act, it was resented by the mercenaries left behind in Sicily.|$|E
