6000|$|Dec. 9, 1873.—On {{thinking}} {{over the}} case as to your seat, I [...] really think it is simple enough. I will put my ideas shortly for [...] your benefit, or you may burn them. You {{did not believe that}} you [...] had vacated your seat on accepting the office of chancellor of the [...] exchequer, and you did not send notice to the Speaker as required [...] by the Act of 1858. Were you right? The solicitor-general said [...] that you were, in a deliberate opinion. The attorney-general [...] concurred. The present law officers consider it so very doubtful [...] that they will not give an opinion. The Speaker either from not [...] having your notice, or having doubts, has not ordered a new writ. [...] These are the facts. <b>What</b> <b>should</b> <b>you</b> <b>do?</b> Up to the meeting of [...] parliament you clearly must act as if there was no doubt. If you [...] do not, you almost admit being wrong. You must assume yourself to [...] be right, that you are justified in the course which you have [...] taken, and act consistently on that view. When parliament meets, I [...] think the proper course would be for the Speaker to say that he [...] had received a certificate of vacancy from two members, but not [...] the notice from the member himself, and having doubts he referred [...] the matter to the House, according to the Act. This ensures the [...] priority of the question and calls on you to explain your not [...] having sent the notice. You state the facts as above, place [...] yourself {{in the hands of the}} House, and withdraw. I agree with [...] what Bright said that the House of Commons will deal quite fairly [...] in such a case. A committee will be appointed. I don’t think it [...] can last very long, and you will be absent during its sitting. No [...] important business can be taken during your absence, and I do not [...] know that any evil will ensue from shortening the period of [...] business before the budget. They may vote estimates, or take minor [...] matters.|$|E
