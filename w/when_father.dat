She was unmoved <b>when</b> <b>Father</b> Châtillon, Roger's childhood tutor, declared the Claimant an impostor, and she allowed Holmes to inform The Times in London that she had recognised Roger. She settled an income of £1,000 a year on him, and accompanied him to England to declare her support before the more sceptical members of the Tichborne family.|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{potential}} promotive effects of cultural values is particularly relevant {{for studies on}} Mexican-origin fathers {{who are at risk}} for exposure to multiple sociocultural contextual stressors. Studies, however, have yet to account for specific sociocultural contextual stressors that are particularly pertinent to Mexican-origin groups, such as immigrant- and ethnic-based discrimination and acculturative stress. According to the Family Stress Model, stressors undermine parenting through psychological dysfunction. Using a community sample of Mexican-origin biological fathers (N = 85) of 3 to 6 year-old children, this study aimed to: first, test the linkages between sociocultural contextual stressors and psychological distress; second, test the linkages between psychological distress and parenting practices; and lastly, consider whether cultural values, namely, familismo, respeto, and caballerismo, moderate these associations. Findings from hierarchical linear regression analyses indicated that immigrant-based discrimination stress was positively related to psychological distress only <b>when</b> <b>fathers</b> strongly endorsed familismo and respeto. In addition, a positive relationship between economic hardship and psychological distress existed only <b>when</b> <b>fathers</b> endorsed high levels of familismo. Findings also showed that the inverse relationship between psychological distress and supportive coparenting quality was substantiated <b>when</b> <b>fathers</b> endorsed low levels of familismo. An inverse link between psychological distress and father accessibility was also observed <b>when</b> <b>fathers</b> reported low levels of respeto. Examining how culturally specific risks and strengths inform future responsible fatherhood intervention work among Mexican-origin families is discussed...|$|R

25|$|The {{two parts}} of the complex which do not connect {{directly}} or indirectly to the main nave are the Escuela Santa de Cristo and the Casa de Ejercicios. The Casa de Ejercicios is a prayer and meditation facility which was built according to the principles of Ignatius of Loyola. They are based on a set of spiritual “exercises” designed during the reformation to help Catholics reinforce their faith. This type of building came to Mexico around 1665 and, 100 years later, Father Neri had the casa de ejercicios built. This building is mostly separate {{from the rest of the}} complex and is decorated differently. Only inscriptions such as poems appear with the intention of providing meditative help. <b>When</b> <b>Father</b> Neri died, there were 7,541 men who lived and studied there. Today, there are thirty, with 19 being women. However, about 75,000 visit each year.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{original}} mural work that covered the walls and ceilings are deteriorated or lost, but reconstructed murals {{have been added to}} parts, especially in the spaces between the nerves of the vaults. These murals contain soft colors which form lines, geometrical shapes and floral shapes reminiscent of ironwork. These probably date to the last third of the 19th century but this is mostly conjecture. The side walls contain faded remnants of narrative scenes, which have not been dated either. One of the best conserved elements inside the church is the 16th century pulpit, made of sandstone sculpted with fine Gothic style designs. In each of the faces of the design, anagrams of the name of Christ or the coat of arms of the Augustinians appear. There is none like it from all of the Mexican colonial period. The original confession booths are built into the wall on the right hand side of the nave, separating the church and the cloister, with the priest entering one side and the confessor entering through the other. They were covered up for much of the church’s history until 1954, <b>when</b> <b>Father</b> Jose Maria Mendez moved the altars on this wall to reveal them. Between them and the baptistery area, there is a large door that leads to the cloister of the former monastery. In colonial times, this door was only opened for Mass on major festivals.|$|E
25|$|The War of Independence {{broke out}} in the state of Guanajuato in the town of Dolores, <b>when</b> <b>Father</b> Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla shouted the “Grito de Dolores” and raised an insurgent army on 15 and 16 September 1810. This army marched to San Miguel, today San Miguel de Allende, and then onto the city of Guanajuato. Just on the {{outskirts}} on 28 September 1810, Hidalgo sent a warning letter to city authorities, but it was ignored. Instead, royalist troops and many of the elite made their stand at the Alhóndiga de Granaditas granary, an imposing building with few windows and thick walls. After entering the city unopposed, Hidalgo decided to attack the granary. This was the first battle against Spanish troops in the war and is popularly called the 'Siege of the Alhondiga'. The insurgents were unable to take the heavily defended building as royalist gunfire kept them from approaching the only entrance until a miner by the name of Juan José de los Reyes Martínez, better known as El Pípila, brilliantly strapped a large flat stone onto his back for protection. Crawling, he carried a flask of tar and a torch. When he reached the wooden doors of the main entrance, he smeared it with the tar and set it on fire. This allowed the insurgents to penetrate the building, defeat the Spanish royalist army and elite, and take over the heavily fortified and defended building. This action is commemorated by a colossal statue of Pipila on a hill overlooking the city.|$|E

25|$|The site of {{the church}} and former monastery of San Juan Bautista was a teocalli, or sacred precinct, {{dedicated}} to a god of commerce called Yacapitzauac. This teocalli was destroyed by the Spanish under Gonzalo de Sandoval when he captured and sacked the settlement in 1521. This teocalli and god were the center of the pre-Hispanic community. The Franciscans were the first to arrive in the 1520s to evangelize the local population and they built a small church on the site. However, this church was destroyed in a fire. The Augustinians took over evangelization in the 1530s and formally established the monastery, dedicated to John the Baptist. This figure was chosen because Yacapitzauac was depicted with a staff as a sign of his authority, and John the Baptist is often depicted with a staff. Most of the monastery was constructed between 1535 and 1540. At that time, there was sufficient income to the order to not only finish much of the monastery in a short time, but also to add a number of fine details. Construction of a number of smaller elements continued until 1586. The complex presents similarities with others built by the Augustinians in eastern Morelos at this time, such as a stone wall around the perimeter and the use of merlons, which give these monasteries the look of a medieval castle. Due to the diminishing importance of Yecapixtla, the monastery was mostly abandoned by the 17th century, with the Augustinians losing formal control {{of the church and}} community in the mid 18th century. The complex remained mostly untouched until the late 19th century, <b>when</b> <b>Father</b> José Pilar Sandoval did some remodeling work in the main nave of the church. More restoration work was undertaken by Father Evaristo Nava in the early 20th century, which included the addition of an organ and changing the sacristy into a tabernacle. In 1994, the complex became part of the Monasteries on the Slopes of Popocatépetl World Heritage Site.|$|E
