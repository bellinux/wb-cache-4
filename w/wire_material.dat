5000|$|A wider wire {{results in}} smaller current density and, hence, less {{likelihood}} of electromigration. Also, the metal grain size has influence; the smaller grains, the more grain boundaries {{and the higher}} likelihood of electromigration effects. However, if you reduce wire width to below the average grain size of the <b>wire</b> <b>material,</b> grain boundaries become [...] "crosswise", more or less perpendicular {{to the length of}} the wire. The resulting structure resembles the joints in a stalk of bamboo. With such a structure, the resistance to electromigration increases, despite an increase in current density. This apparent contradiction is caused by the perpendicular position of the grain boundaries; the boundary diffusion factor is excluded, and material transport is correspondingly reduced.|$|E

The wire ends should be stripped 3/16 to 5/16 in. Shorter stripped wires might result in bad contact with the board's spring clips (insulation being caught in the springs). Longer stripped wires increase the likelihood of short-circuits on the board. Needle-nose pliers and tweezers are helpful when inserting or removing wires, particularly on crowded boards.|$|E

Telephones were already being used to support military campaigns in British India and in British colonies in Africa in the late 1870s and early 1880s. In the United States telephone lines connected fortresses {{with each other and with}} army headquarters. They were also used for fire control at fixed coastal defence installations. The first telephone for use in the field was developed in the United States in 1889 but it was too expensive for mass production. Subsequent developments in several countries made the field telephone more practicable. The <b>wire</b> <b>material</b> was changed from iron to copper, devices for laying wire in the field were developed and systems with both battery-operated sets for command posts and hand generator sets for use in the field were developed. The first purposely-designed field telephones were used by the British in the Second Boer War. They were used more extensively in the Russo-Japanese War, where all infantry regiments and artillery divisions on both sides were equipped with telephone sets. By the First World War the use of field telephones was widespread.|$|E

40|$|Today, micro- {{and power}} {{electronic}} components are used within a rapidly {{increasing number of}} different automotive applications playing a key role within power generation and energy conversion systems. As a consequence, particularly the interconnecting materials of electronics systems are extremely challenged by harsh environment conditions like high operational temperatures, which are partially superposed by intensive mechanical loading and high thermo mechanical stresses.

40|$|Thermosonic {{ball bonding}} {{is the most}} popular method used to create {{electrical}} interconnects between integrated circuits (ICs) and substrates in the microelectronics industry. Traditionally gold (Au) wire is used, however with industry demands for lower costs and higher performance, novel <b>wire</b> <b>materials</b> are being considered. Some of these <b>wire</b> <b>materials</b> include Cu, insulated, and coated wires. The most promising of which being Cu wire. Some of the main issues with these <b>wire</b> <b>materials</b> is their performance in the electrical flame off (EFO) step of the wire bonding process. In the EFO step a ball called the free air ball (FAB) is formed {{on the end of the}} wire. The quality of the FAB is essential for reliable and strong ball bonds. In Cu wire bonding the hardness of the FAB and oxidation are the main issues. A hard FAB requires larger bonding forces and US levels to make the bond which increases the likelihood of damage to the IC. Excessive oxidation acts as a contaminant at the bond interface and can also influence the shape of the FAB. Shielding gases are required to reduce oxidation and improve FAB quality. This thesis focuses on the EFO process and the influence of EFO parameters and shielding gases on Au and Cu FABs. The primary focus of this thesis is to provide a better understanding of the EFO process in order to expedite the introduction of novel <b>wire</b> <b>materials</b> into industry. Several different experiments are performed on an automated thermosonic wire bonder with 25 µm Au and Cu wires to investigate the EFO process during ball bonding. The effects of EFO parameters on the hardness and work hardening of FABs and the effects of shielding gas type and flow rates on the quality of the FABs are determined. The EFO discharge characteristics in different shielding gases is also studied to better understand how the composition of the atmosphere the FAB is formed in influences the energy input via the EFO electrical discharge. Using the online deformability method and Vickers microhardness testing it is found that the EFO current (IEFO) and EFO time (tEFO) have a large influence on the hardness and work hardening of Au and Cu FABs. A harder FAB produced with a large IEFO and low tEFO will work harden less during deformation. The bonded ball will be softer than that of a FAB produced with a lower IEFO and higher tEFO. The online deformability method is found to be twice as precise as the Vickers microhardness test. An online method for characterizing the quality of FABs is developed and used to identify shielding gas flow rates that produce defective FABs. The EFO process for an Au wire and two Cu <b>wire</b> <b>materials</b> is investigated in flow rates of 0. 2 - 1. 0 l/min of forming gas (5 % H 2 + 95 % N 2) and N 2 gas. All three of the most common FAB defects are identified with this online method. It is found that good quality FABs cannot be produced above flow rates of 0. 7 l/min and that H 2 in the shielding gas adds a thermal component to the EFO process. It is recommended that the gas flow rate be optimized for each new wire type used. The EFO discharge power is measured to be 12 % higher in a N 2 gas atmosphere than in a forming gas atmosphere. The lower ionization potential of the forming gas leads to a higher degree of ionization and therefore lower resistance across the discharge gap. It was found that the discharge power does not determine the energy transferred to the wire anode because the Au FAB produced in forming gas has a 6 % larger diameter than that of the FABs produced in N 2 gas. Other factors that effect the voltage of the EFO discharge include the controlled EFO current, the discharge gap, and the <b>wire</b> anode <b>material...</b>|$|R

The PSB, PS and SPS are equipped with scanners which move through the beam a 30 um wire through the beam, with a speed that can vary between 0. 4 to 20 m/s. During each scan, the beam suffers an emittance blow up, due to multiple Coulomb scattering of the beam protons on the lattice nuclei of the <b>wire</b> <b>material.</b> The effect depends on the particles energy, the betatron function at the monitor location and on the monitor characteristics (<b>wire</b> <b>material,</b> diameter and speed).

40|$|Harmful heating mechanisms, {{resulting}} in wire break-age, limit the utilisation of wire scanner monitors to be-low a given beam intensity. This threshold {{depends on the}} accelerator design parameters. In lepton colliders, the short beam bunches generate strong wake-fields inside the vacuum pipe which are sensed by the wire and are the predominant current limit. These effects can be minimised by a smooth design of the monitor cross section and by choosing a wire made of an insulating material [1]. A second source of energy deposition inside the wire, also present in hadron machines, and even when the <b>wire</b> <b>material</b> is insulating, results from collision and ionisation of the <b>wire</b> <b>material</b> atoms by the incident beam particles.

The applied approach aims at an improved understanding of basic material properties governing the general reliabi lity behavior of the wires independently from any specific application.
