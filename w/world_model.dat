40|$|This study summarises {{the methodological}} {{aspects of the}} most {{important}} computerised <b>world</b> <b>models</b> and describes their prospects for the near future. Throughout the three stages of the evolution of <b>world</b> <b>modelling,</b> the development of computer technology has had a definitive role, hence this study regards computer technology as a framework of <b>world</b> <b>modelling.</b> The first evolutionary stage is related to the spread of IBM computers {{at the beginning of the}} 1970 s, its milestone being the model published in The Limits to Growth (Meadows et al. 1972). With the spread of desktop computers in the second stage, <b>world</b> <b>models</b> that could run on PCs appeared; the first one being MicroIFs (International Futures) in the second part of the 1980 s. The third wave was generated by the proliferation of the Internet and the continuing acceleration of the processing speed of computers. Models have become downloadable, virtually simultaneous processing options enable multi- agent-based simulations. As a result of these, models can be extended with the analyses of dynamic and emergent phenomena. Recent methodological concepts and trends promise new theoretical synthesis of <b>world</b> <b>modelling...</b>|$|R

[...] Higher levels of the RMA however, may have sophisticated mathematical world models and behavior implemented by automated planning and scheduling. [...] Planning is required when certain behaviors cannot be triggered by current sensations, but rather by predicted or anticipated sensations, especially those that come about as result of the node's actions.|$|E

Prior to World War II, firms such as Bassett-Lowke in England and the German company Wiking marketed these to the public.

2500|$|Mallow Racecourse, {{now known}} as Cork Racecourse, became an {{emergency}} airfield on 18 April 1983, when a Mexican Gulfstream II business jet piloted by Captain Reuben Ocaña made a precautionary landing. A temporary tarmacadam runway of 910 m (3,000ft) in length which was {{paid for by the}} plane's insurers was laid to enable the aircraft to leave five weeks later, whereas in the meantime Captain Ocaña became a local celebrity. On 23 May 1983 just before the plane departed, the Captain said his farewell to the people of Ireland in the Irish language. [...] The runway was subsequently utilised for parking during race meets and was a popular facility for learner driving. Light aircraft have occasionally landed at the racecourse on the grass area.
