Biofuels are {{increasingly}} promoted worldwide as a means for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transport. However, current regulatory frameworks and most academic life cycle analyses adopt a deterministic approach in determining the GHG intensities of biofuels and thus ignore the inherent risk associated with biofuel production. This study aims to develop a transparent stochastic method for evaluating UK biofuels that determines both the magnitude and uncertainty of GHG intensity on the basis of current industry practices. Using <b>wheat</b> <b>ethanol</b> as a case study, we show that the GHG intensity could span a range of 40 - 110 gCO 2 e MJ- 1 when land use change (LUC) emissions and various sources of uncertainty are taken into account, as compared with a regulatory default value of 44 gCO 2 e MJ- 1. This suggests that the current deterministic regulatory framework underestimates <b>wheat</b> <b>ethanol</b> GHG intensity and thus may not be effective in evaluating transport fuels. Uncertainties in determining the GHG intensity of UK <b>wheat</b> <b>ethanol</b> include limitations of available data at a localized scale, and significant scientific uncertainty of parameters such as soil N 2 O and LUC emissions. Biofuel polices should be robust enough to incorporate the currently irreducible uncertainties and flexible enough to be readily revised when better science is available. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the world market}} impact of an expansion in the biofuel sector in the European Union with particular focus on indirect land-use impacts. In the first scenario, an increase of 1 million tonnes oil equivalent (Mtoe) of <b>wheat</b> <b>ethanol</b> use in the European Union expands world land area used in agricultural commodity production by 366, 000 hectares, representing an increase of 0. 039 % in total area. In the second scenario, an increase of 1 Mtoe of rapeseed oil biodiesel use in the European Union expands world land area by 352, 000 hectares, representing an increase of 0. 038 % in total area. With additional land use somewhat close between the two scenarios, the main difference is the spatial distribution {{of the sources of}} additional supply. Because the wheat sector, especially in the European Union, is large (26. 4 million hectares), when wheat use for ethanol production expands, most of the adjustment is met within the European Union, with only a 9 % reduction in net exports required. In contrast, since the rapeseed sector is smaller (only 7. 8 mha in the EU), 57 % of additional rapeseed oil used for expanded biodiesel production is supplied from higher imports, allowing substantial adjustment by countries outside of the European Union. biofuels, land use, partial equilibrium model, rapeseed oil biodiesel scenario, <b>wheat</b> <b>ethanol</b> scenario. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the work reported here was to reduce the uncertainty on the greenhouse gas balances of biofuels using agro-ecosystem modeling at a high resolution over the Ile-de-France region in Northern France. The emissions simulated during the feedstock production stage were input to a life-cycle assessment of candidate biofuel pathways: bioethanol from wheat, sugar-beet and miscanthus, and biodiesel from oilseed rape. Compared to the widely-used methodology based on fixed emission factors, ecosystem modeling lead to 55 - 70 % lower estimates for N 2 O emissions, emphasizing the importance of regional factors. The lifecycle GHG emissions of first-generation biofuels were 50 - 70 % lower than fossil-based equivalents, and 85 % lower for cellulosic ethanol. When including indirect land-use change effects, GHG savings became marginal for biodiesel and <b>wheat</b> <b>ethanol,</b> but were positive due to direct effects for cellulosic ethanol.

40|$|A {{framework}} for analyzing {{the impact on}} the expected cost of oil disruption by energy policies in EU- 25 is developed. The framework takes into account how energy policies affect the oil market, the expected oil price increase, and the disruption costs. OPEC’s strategic behaviour is modelled as a dominant firm, and the model includes price interdependence between different energy commodities to better estimate the cost of an oil disruption. It is found that substituting pellets for oil in households and using imported sugar cane ethanol are cost-efficient policies if greenhouse gas benefits are included. Domestically produced <b>wheat</b> <b>ethanol</b> is not found to be cost-efficient even if both the expected cost of oil disruption and greenhouse gas benefits are included, the same also holds for hybrid vehicles.

40|$|International audienceThe {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) balance of biofuels largely {{hinges on the}} magnitude of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from arable soils during feedstock production, which are highly variable. Here, used an agro-ecosystem model to generate these emissions at a high resolution over the Ile-de-France region in Northern France, {{for a range of}} feedstocks. The emissions were input to a life-cycle assessment of candidate biofuel pathways: bioethanol from wheat and sugar-beet, biodiesel from oilseed rape, and ethanol from miscanthus. Compared to the widely-used methodology based on fixed emission factors, ecosystem modelling lead to 55 % to 70 % lower estimates for N 2 O emissions, emphasizing the importance of regional factors. The life-cycle GHG emissions of 1 st generation biofuels were 50 % to 70 % lower than fossile-based equivalents, and 85 % lower for cellulosic ethanol.

40|$|Wheat-based thin {{stillage}} (W-TS) is liquid by-product of <b>wheat</b> <b>ethanol</b> production and contains valuable chemical intermediates such as 1, 3 -propanediol (1, 3 -PD), acetic acid, and glycerophosphorylcholine. Unfortunately, these compounds cannot be recovered/extracted easily {{due to the}} presence of high boiling point and hygroscopic solutes and unfermented particles from ethanol fermentation. Fermentation improvement study using endemic bacteria augmented with Lactobacillus panis PM 1 B discovered that glucose, incubation temperature, micronutrients, and pH adjustment affected two-stage fermentation (TSF). Importantly, fermentation could be scaled to a 210 L fermenter where 2 % (w/v) 1, 3 -PD was produced. Unfermented particles should be removed prior to compound recovery. TSF was effective in producing solutions that were virtually free of colloids. Bacteria present in TSF system produced anoxic gas and exopolysaccharides and the combined action produced substantially clear solution. On the other hand, recovered particles, rich in lactobacilli, had a high protein content (50 %, w/w, dry basis), which might be useful as an animal feed ingredient. Washing processes could lower moisture content and recover a high protein slurry (60 % w/w, dry basis).

40|$|Making {{life cycle}} {{assessments}} (LCAs) based on {{just part of}} the agrofuel production life cycle and without taking account of the wider impacts is irrelevant and entirely misleading. The micro-lifecycle is the one most often quoted by industry analysts who measure the fossil fuel investments but ignore the macro-impacts of increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, accelerating deforestation, the loss of ecosystem functions and ultimately the triggering of irreversible climate feedbacks. These macroimpacts are so expansive and impossible to assess {{that there can be no}} accurate figure for agrofuel LCAs making agrofuel standards and certification impossible and irrelevant. Paul Crutzen et al 1 attemped to close part of the gap in life-cycle emissions by assessing the full indirect as well as direct GHG emissions from nitrous oxide (N 2 O). Factoring in full N 2 O emissions for the following feedstocks resulted immediately in unfavourable GHG balances, although no other greenhouse gas emissions from the production of biofuels were considered in that study.

40|$|Life cycle {{assessments}} (LCAs, including well-to-wheel studies) {{that are}} to support decisions that strive to change large technical systems need to consider time- and scale-related factors that are given little attention in standard LCA procedures. We {{suggest that it is}} important to look beyond the current situation and study many possible future states, what we call stylised states, to explore general technology differences. We choose to address three issues in this report. Our case study deals with alternative fuels for transportation, and relates to a recent well-to-wheel study performed by CONCAWE, EUCAR and JRC. The methodological results, though, could be of equal importance when studying other major technologies. First, shifting time frame gives room for technical development that should affect not only the choice of performance data, but perhaps also the functional unit and the selection of technologies under study. Second, background systems such as heat and power production change over time, and we exemplify by using three different systems, mainly based on coal, natural gas and short rotation forestry, respectively. Increased production volumes may for some technologies also change the background system, which is of particular importance for technologies that are used in their own production processes. We show that for biofuels changes in background systems have consequences not only for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and agricultural land use for each fuel chain, but also for the ranking order of e. g. <b>wheat</b> <b>ethanol</b> and RME, in terms of GHG emissions. We use what we call a net output approach, which implies that a fraction of the produced biofuel is used for its own production. Accordingly, the functional unit used in this study is 1 MJ fuel available for other purposes than producing fuel. Finally, different types of feedstock are available in different quantities and different by-product markets vary in size. Allocation of environmental impact between product and by-products is here made through system expansion, and we study some possible markets for by-products. To give an example of by-product effects, current key markets for ethanol by-products in EU- 15 correspond to an ethanol production that covers about 2 % of demand, and for RME about 3 %, that is, well below the 5. 75 % EU biofuel target for 2010. Therefore, the GHG emissions and agricultural land use allocated to the fuels differ between a low and a high market penetration. Combining the results, we show that time and scale are important factors for the ranking of <b>wheat</b> <b>ethanol,</b> RME and wood methanol in terms of GHG emissions and agricultural land use, as the results are dependent on assumptions regarding background system and by-product markets. We indicate that agricultural land use results can be weighted in GHG terms in several ways, e. g. by using short rotation forestry or solar panels as a reference, an approach that would require further research...|$|E
40|$|Current {{renewable}} {{jet fuel}} (RJF) volumes are limited due to low demand {{as a result}} of high prices. Stringent quality and sustainability criteria require advanced conversion technologies. It is argued that the evolution towards greenfield, cellulosic biofuel production can be expedited by pursuing co-production strategies in which the production facility is located next to (co-location) or integrated (retro-fitted) with existing assets. Potential benefits of co-production include, amongst others, shared supply chains and plant infrastructure. However, {{little is known about the}} comparative techno-economic performance of the production pathways for RJF as well as the economic merits of co-production strategies for the development of RJF. This research assesses the techno-economic performance of co-production strategies (i. e. feedstock-technology combination) of RJF at existing facilities of the pulp and paper, <b>wheat</b> <b>ethanol</b> and beet sugar industry in the EU- 28. The results are used to compare the co-production strategies amongst each other and juxtapose them to greenfield production. The techno-economic assessment comprises the production pathways currently approved for commercial flight or under review by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). Based on the primary and secondary residue streams in the selected industries, thirteen co-production strategies were selected. The co-production strategies were assessed on a consistent basis for technology-specific bare equipment costs, mass and energy balances and GHG balances which were adopted from existing software-modelling studies. The SCENT factorial estimation method was used to estimate total capital and operating expenditures. A novel methodology was formulated to quantify the benefits of co-production with respect to greenfield production. Geospatial features were taken into account using local feedstock availability on NUTS- 3 level, nation-specific parameters (e. g. feedstock prices, labor costs) and the actual locations of existing facilities. The minimum fuel selling price (MFSP), i. e. the cost price at which the RJF needs to be sold to achieve a zero net present value, was used for evaluation. The results show that biochemical pathways yield a higher MFSP than thermochemical pathways for RJF production, largely because of the lower conversion yields (on feedstock dry basis) and the high capital cost of lignocellulosic sugar extraction. The spread in MFSP indicates the results at different production locations. Co-production strategies based on Pyrolysis and HTL show the lowest MFSP due to relatively high conversion yields and modest CAPEX. Also, co-location can reduce the MFSP with 4 - 8 % with respect to greenfield configurations, mainly due to reduced CAPEX. A pioneer plant analysis shows that co-production has larger economic benefits in the early stages of development. <b>Wheat</b> <b>ethanol</b> facilities and pulp mills prove better incubator facilities than sugar mills as the former two industries accumulate more substantial amounts of residues along their supply chain, resulting in advantages of economies of scale. Lastly, the results show a spatial preference towards countries with low labor costs and low feedstock cost (i. e. Eastern EU and Portugal). It is concluded that co-production strategies can potentially be a catalyst for the ramp-up of RJF production in the short term in the EU- 28, particularly in the first stages of development of a technology...|$|E

A consortium led by NDSU is currently engaged in a project that would use cellulose nanofibers derived from wheat straw to make a product that could substitute for fiberglass and plastics in many applications, including automotive parts. The work described here analyzes the economic value of producing cellulose nanowhiskers (CNW) as a co-product in an ethanol biorefinery. An ASPEN Plus-based process model was developed to evaluate <b>ethanol</b> production from <b>wheat</b> straw. The base case model generated 54. 418 million gallons per year (MGPY) of denatured ethanol, using approximately 900, 000 tons per year of wheat straw feedstock. The capital cost was estimated at $ 185 million. Total operating costs, excluding by-product credits, were $ 92. 4 million per year. Revenue from sales was estimated at $ 98. 0 million per year from ethanol and $ 7. 5 million per year from electricity. The earnings before interest and income tax (EBIT) are $ 13. 1 million per year providing a return on investment (ROI) of 7. 06 percent. The production cost of ethanol including by-product credit was determined at $ 1. 56 per gallon.

40|$|This study {{compares the}} {{short-term}} economic feasibility of six conversion pathways for renewable jet fuel (RJF) production. The assessment combines (i) a harmonized techno-economic analysis of conversion pathways {{expected to be}} certified for use in commercial aviation by 2020, (ii) a pioneer plant analysis taking into account technological immaturity, and (iii) a quantified assessment of the merits of co-producing RJF alongside existing European supply chains in the pulp, <b>wheat</b> <b>ethanol,</b> and beet sugar industries. None of the pathways assessed are able to reach price parity with petroleum-derived jet fuel in the short term. The pioneer plant analysis suggests that the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) pathway is currently the best option; the technology achieves the lowest minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of 29. 3 € GJ– 1 (1289 € t– 1) and the technology is deployed on commercial scale already. In the short term, nth plant analysis shows hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and pyrolysis emerging as promising alternatives, yielding MFSPs of 21. 4 € GJ– 1 (939 € t– 1) and 30. 2 € GJ– 1 (1326 € t– 1), respectively. The pioneer plant analysis shows considerable MFSP increases for producing drop-in fuels using HTL and pyrolysis as both technologies are relatively immature. Hence, further RD&D efforts into these pathways are recommended. Co-production strategies decrease the MFSP by 4 – 8 % compared to greenfield production. Integration of process units and material and energy flows is expected to lead to further cost reductions. As such, co-production can be a particularly useful strategy to progress emerging technologies to commercial scale...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{evaluate}} systems for making organic farms self-sufficient in bio-based fuels. The energy efficiency and environmental load for systems based on rape methyl ester (RME), ethanol and biogas produced by processing raw material from the farm in industrial-scale plants were evaluated using a life cycle perspective. Eventual constraints when implementing the systems in practice were also identified and the farmer’s costs for the systems estimated. The RME scenario showed some good characteristics; the energy efficiency and potential effects on global warming were favourable, the technology well known and no engine modifications were necessary. However, {{the high price of}} the organically produced rapeseed made the fuel expensive. The ethanol scenario provided fuel at a comparatively low cost, but the energy efficiency was low and existing engines would have to be modified. The biogas scenario was not as economically advantageous, due to high costs for storage and transport of the biogas and the extensive tractor modifications needed. The calculations further showed that systems based on so-called exchange of fuels, i. e. when the farm produces raw material for one type of biofuel, but instead uses another type of biofuel more suitable for its own tractors, were an economically favourable way of supplying the organic farms with ‘self-produced’ bio-based fuels. The exchange scenario based on delivery of organic wheat to a large-scale plant and use of RME at the farm was somewhat more expensive than scenarios based on production of biogas raw material at the farm. However, the wheat/RME system has the advantage of being possible to put into practice immediately, since industrial-scale <b>wheat</b> <b>ethanol</b> plants are in operation and RME fuel is available on the market...|$|E
30|$|Steam {{at three}} {{different}} pressures {{is used in}} the simulations of utilities, depending on the configuration. For the 1 G stand-alone plant, a moderate pressure of 6 bar and a low pressure of 4 bar are assumed to be required; 6 bar is chosen since the dryer is designed to be operating at 150 °C. In the 2 G plant, high-pressure steam at 20 bar and low-pressure steam at 4 bar are chosen since pretreatment is carried out at 190 °C, {{and the rest of the}} process is operated below 140 °C. In the combined plant it is presumed that steam at all three pressures is available from the beginning of the process. It is assumed that cooling water between 10 - 19 °C at a pressure of 1 bar is used in all plants. In all cases except the 1 G stand-alone plant, it is also assumed that a CHP plant supplies the ethanol plants with steam. Primary steam is designed to be produced at 91 bar and 470 °C, and electricity is produced by a steam turbine and a back-pressure turbine. The CHP plant is not included in the pinch analysis. The CHP system is designed to be used to incinerate residual material (excluding any DDGS production) and biogas produced in the process. The residual material consists of a mixture of solids from the separation step after distillation and syrup from evaporation. When the incineration of residual material and biogas is not sufficient to run the process, natural gas, assumed to be pure methane, was added. The 1 G stand-alone plant is presumed to be entirely powered by natural gas, as this is relatively common in the corn ethanol plants operating in the USA today [42]. Optionally, straw could have been used as external energy, however, methane was used in this case for easy comparison with existing infrastructure. Other sources of energy can be used to run the 1 G plant. For example, sugarcane ethanol plants are often supplied with energy from the incineration of bagasse [43] and residual materials from the field, while at the 1 G <b>wheat</b> <b>ethanol</b> plant in Norrköping, Sweden, biomass and domestic waste are used to produce steam [44]. The electricity needed in the plants was included when calculating the energy need to produce one kg of ethanol, by assuming an electricity requirement of 0.84 MJ/kg ethanol. The assumption was made as there are limited data available concerning the energy used for electricity in the considered cases. This value corresponds to an average electricity demand described in a 1 G ethanol corn plant [29].|$|E
40|$|AbstractA UK-based {{environmental}} sustainability study on bioethanol production from wheat straw was conducted using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. Five pathways with leading pretreatment technologies (dilute acid, steam explosion {{with and without}} catalyst, liquid hot water, and wet oxidation) were modelled using process simulation software AspenPlus™, and their advantages and disadvantages were evaluated from an environmental perspective. In a contribution analysis of the environmental profiles for the near-term prospective scenarios, {{results indicated that the}} enzyme is a main contributor in all pathways.

By comparing the five wheat straw production pathways with petrol, it was suggested that those using pretreatment with steam explosion, liquid hot water and wet oxidation can be environmentally favourable over petrol.

40|$|In this study, we {{analyze the}} impact of fertilizer- and manure-induced N 2 O {{emissions}} due to energy crop production on the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions when conventional transportation fuels are replaced by first-generation biofuels (also taking account of other GHG emissions during the entire life cycle). We calculate the nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions by applying a statistical model that uses spatial data on climate and soil. For the land use that {{is assumed to be}} replaced by energy crop production (the 'reference land-use system'), we explore a variety of options, the most important of which are cropland for food production, grassland, and natural vegetation. Calculations are also done in the case that emissions due to energy crop production are fully additional and thus no reference is considered. The results are combined with data on other emissions due to biofuels production that are derived from existing studies, resulting in total GHG emission reduction potentials for major biofuels compared with conventional fuels. The results show that N 2 O emissions can have an important impact on the overall GHG balance of biofuels, though there are large uncertainties. The most important ones are those in the statistical model and the GHG emissions not related to land use. Ethanol produced from sugar cane and sugar beet are relatively robust GHG savers: these biofuels change the GHG emissions by − 103 % to − 60 % (sugar cane) and − 58 % to − 17 % (sugar beet), compared with conventional transportation fuels and depending on the reference land-use system that is considered. The use of diesel from palm fruit also results in a relatively constant and substantial change of the GHG emissions by − 75 % to − 39 %. For corn and <b>wheat</b> <b>ethanol,</b> the figures are − 38 % to 11 % and − 107 % to 53 %, respectively. Rapeseed diesel changes the GHG emissions by − 81 % to 72 % and soybean diesel by − 111 % to 44 %. Optimized crop management, which involves the use of state-of-the-art agricultural technologies combined with an optimized fertilization regime and the use of nitrification inhibitors, can reduce N 2 O emissions substantially and change the GHG emissions by up to − 135 percent points (pp) compared with conventional management. However, the uncertainties in the statistical N 2 O emission model and in the data on non-land-use GHG emissions due to biofuels production are large; they can change the GHG emission reduction by between − 152 and 87 pp...|$|E
40|$|The {{challenge}} of reducing anthropogenic emissions {{of greenhouse gases}} calls {{for a wide variety of}} analyses to make the mitigation effort efficient and achievable. This thesis explores five different issues related to carbon abatement. The first paper examines interactions between the stationary energy sector and the transportation sectors in a carbon constrained world. We find that an energy system dominated by solar energy or nuclear energy tends to make biofuels in plug-in hybrids cost-effective in a 400 ppm carbon dioxide scenario. If instead coal with carbon capture and storage dominates the energy system, hydrogen cars rather than plug-in hybrids tend to become cost-effective. From a Monte Carlo analysis we conclude that the stationary energy system does not alone determine how the transportation sector develops, but that its impact on the absolute and the relative cost of energy carriers has a significant impact. The second paper examines induced technological change in a global energy system model with limited foresight. We find that the introduction of induced technological change reduces the total net present value of the abatement cost over this century by 3 - 9 % (depending on the stabilization target) compared to a case where technological learning is exogenous. Further, we show that technology-specific policies can counter technology lock-in and reduce the abatement cost compared to a case with cap and trade system only. The third paper concerns land-use competition between bioenergy plantations that reduce fossil fuels in the energy sector and long-lived carbon sinks that sequester and store atmospheric carbon. These two abatement options may compete for the same land under a stringent climate target. Using an energy system model we examine whether bioenergy or carbon sinks are the most cost-effective option. We show that long-rotation forests for the purpose of carbon sequestration will not be cost-effective in the long run under a stringent climate policy. Thus, economic efficiency considerations tend to favour short-rotation plantations for high carbon prices. In the fourth paper a framework for analyzing the impact of energy policies in the EU- 25 on the expected cost of oil disruptions is developed. We find that substituting pellets for oil in households is a cost-efficient policy if greenhouse gas benefits are included. Neither domestically-produced <b>wheat</b> <b>ethanol</b> nor hybrid cars are found to be cost-efficient, even if both the expected cost of oil disruption and greenhouse gas benefits are included. In the fifth paper we investigate global income and resource inequality from 1960 to the late 1990 s. We find that the inequality in terms of GDP/capita measured in purchasing power parity terms is rather stable in relative terms, but increasing in absolute terms. We also conclude that resource inequality tends to improve faster than income inequality, even though inequality in electricity and paper consumption in absolute terms has increased significantly since the 1960 s...|$|E
40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} {{of agricultural}} wastes {{provides an opportunity}} for renewable energy production while reducing emissions of greenhouse gasses such as carbon dioxide and methane from crop and livestock production. While anaerobic digestion is possible under a wide range of temperatures and reactor configurations, it does require a stable methanogenic community composed of hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria and methanogenic archaea in order to maintain robust methane production. Research focused on characterizing and optimizing the microbial community during anaerobic digestion is increasingly exploiting DNA-based methods. In addition to providing an in-depth phylogenetic survey, these techniques permit examination of dynamic changes in α- and β-diversity during the digestion process and in response to perturbations in the system. This study used universal target amplification, next generation sequencing, and quantitative PCR to characterize the Bacteria and Archaea in digestate from thermophilic batch anaerobic digesters processing different combinations <b>wheat</b> <b>ethanol</b> stillage waste and cattle manure. The results indicated that the bacterial community was composed primarily of Firmicutes, with Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes also numerically abundant. While less phylogenetically diverse, the archaeal community showed robust populations of both hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens. A core microbiome present across all reactors was identified and differences in the relative abundances of the bacteria within the core community suggested significant niche overlap and metabolic redundancy in the reactors. A time-course study correlating the abundances of individual Bacteria and Archaea to methane production and volatile fatty acid catabolization identified several microorganisms hypothesized to be critical to both hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogenesis. Individual Bacteria most closely related to Clostridium spp. and Acetivibrio spp. were 10 - 1000 -fold less abundant in reactors suffering from volatile fatty acid accumulation and inhibition of methanogenesis. Additionally, failing reactors were devoid of robust populations of acetoclastic methanogens. Microorganisms identified as critical during the time-course study were targeted for isolation in vitro and a robust methanogenic consortium consisting of at least 9 bacteria and both a hydrogenotrophic and an acetoclastic methanogen was stably propagated. Addition of this bioaugmentation consortium to digesters experiencing classic symptoms of acid crisis resulted in reduced acetate accumulation and initiation of methanogenesis. One acetoclastic methanogen, most likely a novel species from the genus Methanosarcina, showed particularly robust growth in the recovered bioaugmented reactors, increasing 100 -fold in the first 7 days post-treatment. A combination of Illumina shotgun and Roche 454 paired-end sequencing chemistry was used to generate a high quality draft genome for this organism. Analysis of the annotated genome revealed diverse metabolic potential with a full complement of genes for acetoclastic, hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic methanogenesis pathways represented. Taken as a whole, this thesis provides the foundation for using microbial community characterization to inform anaerobic digester design and operation. By identifying organisms of interest, correlating their abundance to specific biochemical functions and confirming their hypothesized functions in situ, microorganisms critical for robust methane production were acquired. The logical extension of this work is to establish monitoring tools for microorganisms identified as critical to specific performance parameters, to enumerate them in real-time, and to use that data to improve reactor operation...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{sterilising}} {{agents in}} lieu of energy intensive steam sterilisation was investigated for cellulose ethanol fermentations. Sodium metabisulphite and hydrogen peroxide were added {{to a number of}} simultaneous saccharification and fermentations of <b>wheat</b> straw to <b>ethanol</b> and their effects on acetic acid, lactic acid, glucose and ethanol production were measured. Hydrogen peroxide and sodium metabisulphite both limited the growth of acetic and lactic acid bacteria, without adversely impacting on cellulase performance. At the higher dosage of sodium metabisulphite (2. 14 g/L) there was some evidence of inhibition of yeast action. A dosage of 5. 44 g/L hydrogen peroxide resulted in a 52 % reduction in acetic acid, complete elimination of lactic acid, and a 20 % increase in ethanol production. Hydrogen peroxide is hence considered a potential alternative to steam for scale-up...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{undertakes}} {{an environmental}} evaluation of bioethanol production, using wheat cultivated in Belgium. Cultivation steps are modelled using Belgian specific data. <b>Wheat</b> transformation in <b>ethanol</b> relies on industrial data. GHG emissions {{of the whole}} life cycle are calculated and compared with the default values given by the European Renewable Energy Directive. Belgian wheat bioethanol achieves a 5 % higher GHG reduction than the one mentioned in the European directive but impact repartition is different with a higher importance of cultivation step in our case. Belgian wheat bioethanol complies with the current sustainability criteria but is also able to conform to further ones. Sensitivity analyses are performed {{on the importance of}} N fertilizers and associated emissions known as main important parameters. These analyses reveal non negligible variations and then a range of available GHG reduction when using wheat bioethanol. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|As the fungal laccase {{production}} {{depends on}} some components which induce it, we {{have examined the}} independent effects of <b>ethanol,</b> <b>wheat</b> straw and copper sulphate and their combinations on the volumetric laccase activity of Pycnoporus sanguineus. Wheat straw and copper sulphate gave the best results showing a synergic effect after 13 days of incubation (laccaseactivity was 3 and 4. 5 {{times greater than the}} activity generated when they were used alone). Ethanol on the contrary, was found to {{have a negative effect on}} laccase production. The laccase produced by the fungus  Pycnoporus sanguineusmaintains a good stability in a wide range of temperatures;a stability which also depends on the pH. By choosing the adequate pH, the level and stability of the laccase activity are satisfactory in a range of temperatures from 25 to 70 ºC, which would allow the diversification of laccase use in industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|An {{orthogonal}} design (L(9) (3 (4))) {{was used to}} optimize the microwave pretreatment on <b>wheat</b> straw for <b>ethanol</b> production. The orthogonal analysis was done {{based on the results}} obtained from the nine pretreatments. The effect of four factors including the ratio of biomass to NaOH solution, pretreatment time, microwave power, and the concentration of NaOH solution with three different levels on the chemical composition, cellulose/hemicellulose recoveries and ethanol concentration was investigated. According to the orthogonal analysis, pretreatment with the ratio of biomass to liquid at 80 g kg(- 1), the NaOH concentration of 10 kg m(- 3), the microwave power of 1000 W for 15 min was confirmed to be the optimal condition. The ethanol yield was 148. 93 g kg(- 1) wheat straw at this condition, much higher than that from the untreated material which was only 26. 78 g kg(- 1). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The work reported here analyzes {{the feasibility of}} a multi-product biorefinery using wheat straw as feedstock that produces ethanol, electricity, and cellulose nanofibers. The nanofibers (nanowhiskers) would be used as reinforcements in a biobased nanocomposite material that could substitute for fiberglass in many applications. The analysis indicates that, at 2005 prices and costs, the biorefinery would be marginally profitable. Anticipated advances in bioprocessing technology would enhance profitability. The facility would also make a substantial contribution to the biorefinery site area economy, as {{a high percentage of}} operating expenses would be payments to local entities. The growth of a biobased industry could have major economic development implications for the Great Plains/Midwest region. biomass, biomaterials, <b>ethanol,</b> <b>wheat</b> straw, cellulose nanowhiskers (CNW), economic development, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
40|$|Cotton {{pulp and}} wood pulp were {{commonly}} served {{as raw materials}} to produce microcrystalline cellulose, whereas wheat straw has not been reported for being used as the raw material. This research focused on cellulose purification from <b>wheat</b> straw <b>ethanol</b> pulp by a QZPX pollution-free process, {{which was one of}} the primary processes for MCC preparation. Chelating treatment (Q) used EDTA at the dosage of 0. 4 % (oven dry base, similarly hereinafter). The optimal ozone treatment (Z) was found to be at the dosage of 1. 2 % when the pulp consistency was 45 % and pH was 2. After the Z treatment, the KMnO 4 value of the pulp was decreased from 18. 2 to 3. 7, the brightness was increased from 26. 4 %ISO to 55. 6 %ISO, and the degree of polymerization (DP) was decreased from 675 to 646. The optimal H 2 O 2 (P) process conditions were: pulp consistency 12 %, C 6 H 5 Na 3 O 7 dosage 1 %, H 2 O 2 dosage 3 %, NaOH dosage 1. 8 %, temperature 70 °C, and time 120 min. The suitable xylanase (X) process conditions were enzyme dosage 1. 5 IU/g, pulp consistency 5 %, temperature 50 °C, and time 150 min.

40|$|The {{production}} of crude cellulase in solid-state fermentation was simplified by using environmental selection pressures {{as an alternative}} to specialized strains and by re-using cellulose-to-ethanol fermentation substrate for cellulase production. The performance of wild strains of Trichoderma viride isolated from wheat and bark were found not to differ significantly from a ‘cellulase-enhanced’ strain of Trichoderma reesei. The filter paper activity of a strain of Aspergillus niger isolated in the laboratory was more than two times higher than the specialized T. reesei at 10 days. Activities of enrichment cultures obtained from compost and horse manure were more than double T. reesei after 10 days. Using the solid residue of previous simultaneous saccharification and fermentations of <b>wheat</b> straw to <b>ethanol</b> as substrate for cellulase production brought forward the onset of cellulase production and increased cellulase levels by 50 %.

40|$|AbstractLittle {{is known}} about the effect of soil {{disinfection}} on bacterial communities. Soils were treated with an effective chemical fumigant chloropicrin and biofumigant mustard greens (Brassica juncea). While mustard greens did not affect the soil bacterial community structures very much, chloropicrin greatly reduced soil biomass and bacterial species richness. Chloropicrin also influenced the bacterial community structure, making the phylum Firmicutes dominant by occupying about 75 %. In more than two months, the proportion of Firmicutes was reduced to the basal level, and the phyla Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria became dominant. Since mustard greens worked as carbon sources for soil reduction, soils were treated with wheat bran and a low concentration of ethanol. Soil reduction with <b>wheat</b> bran and <b>ethanol</b> did not influence the soil bacterial community structures. Beta diversity analyzed by Principal Coordinate Analysis showed that bacterial communities in the soils except chloropicrin-applied soils formed a cluster. All together, biofumigant mustard greens, a probable substitute for chloropicrin, were demonstrated to cause much less damage on soil bacterial community than chemical chloropicrin...|$|R
