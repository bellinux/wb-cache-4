5|$|Born William fitzHerbert in York, <b>William</b> <b>was</b> {{the son of}} Herbert of Winchester, or Herbert fitzAlberic, {{chancellor}} and {{treasurer of}} King Henry I.

New research, however, suggests that Emma might have been a daughter of Hunger fitzOdin, who held lands in Dorset in the Domesday survey. <b>William</b> <b>was</b> born sometime before the 1090s, but the exact date of birth is unknown.|$|E

5|$|When King George IV died on 26 June 1830 without {{surviving}} legitimate issue, William succeeded him as King William IV. Aged 64, he was {{the oldest}} person yet to assume the British throne. Unlike his extravagant brother, <b>William</b> <b>was</b> unassuming, discouraging pomp and ceremony. In contrast to George IV, who tended {{to spend most of}} his time in Windsor Castle, <b>William</b> <b>was</b> known, especially early in his reign, to walk, unaccompanied, through London or Brighton.

5|$|<b>William</b> <b>was</b> {{the son of}} the {{unmarried}} Robert I, Duke of Normandy, by Robert's mistress Herleva. His illegitimate {{status and}} his youth caused some difficulties for him after he succeeded his father, as did the anarchy that plagued the first years of his rule. During his childhood and adolescence, members of the Norman aristocracy battled each other, both for control of the child duke and for their own ends. In 1047 <b>William</b> <b>was</b> able to quash a rebellion and begin to establish his authority over the duchy, a process that was not complete until about 1060. His marriage in the 1050s to Matilda of Flanders provided him with a powerful ally in the neighbouring county of Flanders. By the time of his marriage, <b>William</b> <b>was</b> able to arrange the appointments of his supporters as bishops and abbots in the Norman church. His consolidation of power allowed him to expand his horizons, and by 1062 <b>William</b> <b>was</b> able to secure control of the neighbouring county of Maine.|$|E
5|$|As a child <b>William</b> <b>was</b> {{educated in}} Jerusalem, at the cathedral {{school in the}} Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

5|$|Despite {{his success}} in winning the war, William had far less success in {{restoring}} royal power following the peace. In part, this was because <b>William</b> <b>was</b> unable to offer significant patronage, despite the expectations from the loyalist barons {{that they would be}} rewarded. William attempted to enforce the traditional rights of the Crown to approve marriages and wardships, but with little success. Nonetheless, <b>William</b> <b>was</b> able to reconstitute the royal bench of judges and reopen the royal exchequer. The government issued the Charter of the Forest, which attempted to reform the royal governance of the forests. The regency and Llywelyn came to agreement on the Treaty of Worcester in 1218, but its generous terms – Llywelyn became effectively Henry's justiciar across Wales – underlined the weakness of the English Crown.|$|E
5|$|Francis Walsingham {{was born}} in or about 1532, {{probably}} at Foots Cray, near Chislehurst, Kent.

William Walsingham served {{as a member of the}} commission that was appointed to investigate the estates of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey in 1530, and his elder brother, Sir Edmund Walsingham, was Lieutenant of the Tower of London. After William's death, Joyce married the courtier Sir John Carey in 1538. Carey's brother <b>William</b> <b>was</b> the husband of Mary Boleyn, Anne Boleyn's elder sister. Of Francis Walsingham's five sisters, Mary married Sir Walter Mildmay, who was Chancellor of the Exchequer for over 20 years, and Elizabeth married the parliamentarian Peter Wentworth.|$|E

5|$|Hart {{was born}} at Taratahi, a small {{community}} near Carterton in the Wairarapa region. His father, <b>William,</b> <b>was</b> a farm labourer and the grandson of John Hart, a three-time Premier of South Australia. One of four children, he was educated firstly at Dalefield School, and then Carterton School. After finishing his formal education he worked for his uncle, an auctioneer and land broker, while also studying bookkeeping.|$|E
5|$|His {{specific}} origins are unclear; {{according to}} the seventeenth-century genealogist Père Anselme, {{he was the son}} of Ursio I, viscount of Melun, a town about 50 kilometres outside Paris in the Brie region of the French Vexin, which was later known as the Île-de-France. Anselme believed William succeeded his father in 1084, and was later succeeded by his own son, Ursio II. However, in the nineteenth century, Adolphe Duchalais showed that Anselme misread the charters he was using; all that is known for certain is that Ursio was viscount in 1085 and <b>William</b> <b>was</b> viscount in 1094. There is no definite record of an Ursio II, and after William there is no viscount known until Adam, who married the daughter of the previous, unnamed viscount in 1138. <b>William</b> <b>was</b> presumably related to Ursio but his specific relationship to him and the other viscounts is unknown.|$|E

5|$|In 1179, <b>William</b> <b>was</b> one of {{the delegates}} from Jerusalem and the other crusader states at the Third Lateran Council; among the others were Heraclius, {{archbishop}} of Caesarea, Joscius, bishop of Acre and William's future successor in Tyre, the bishops of Sebastea, Bethlehem, Tripoli, and Jabala, and the abbot of Mount Sion. Patriarch Amalric and Patriarch of Antioch Aimery of Limoges were unable to attend, and William and the other bishops did not have sufficient weight to persuade Pope Alexander III {{of the need for}} a new crusade. <b>William</b> <b>was,</b> however, sent by Alexander as an ambassador to Emperor Manuel, and Manuel then sent him on a mission to the Principality of Antioch. William does not mention exactly what happened during these embassies, but he probably discussed the Byzantine alliance with Jerusalem, and Manuel's protectorate over Antioch, where, due to pressure from Rome and Jerusalem, the emperor was forced to give up his attempts to restore a Greek patriarch. <b>William</b> <b>was</b> absent from Jerusalem for two years, returning home in 1180.|$|E
5|$|In 1198 and 1199, <b>William</b> <b>was</b> Sheriff of Devon and Sheriff of Cornwall, {{along with}} another royal servant, {{and served as a}} royal justice. In 1200 he was {{recorded}} as a receiver of the carucage, a tax on land, in the Pipe roll; whether this meant that he was a local or a national collector of the tax is unclear. By 12 September 1204, <b>William</b> <b>was</b> Archdeacon of Taunton in the Diocese of Bath, and he witnessed the election of Jocelin of Wells as the new bishop of the diocese. He was jointly placed in charge of the mints of London and Canterbury in 1205, along with Reginald de Cornhill, with whom he also shared the collection of the tax of a fifteenth on merchants, a post the two had held since 1202. In May 1205 William, along with de Cornhill, was given custody of one of three dies for the mint at Chichester; in July the king gave William's custody to Simon of Wells, the Bishop of Chichester. <b>William</b> <b>was</b> one of the officials in charge of the collection of a tax of a thirteenth in 1207.|$|E
5|$|In 1206 <b>William</b> <b>was</b> {{in charge}} of the naval forces in the Cinque Ports and {{commanded}} the fleet that invaded Poitou. Whether he accompanied the fleet or stayed in England after it sailed is unclear; according to two historians– F. W. Brooks and R. W. Powell– it is more likely he stayed. From 1206 until 1215 he was effectively commander of King John's navy, and helped to develop Portsmouth as a royal dockyard. In 1208 <b>William</b> <b>was</b> put {{in charge of}} ensuring that no ships sailed without royal permission. That year he also oversaw the naval preparations made by the Cinque Ports. The purpose of these preparations is unknown; the Annals of Dunstable ascribe to John a desire to oppress the Cinque Ports. During May 1208 a royal order was issued that William's deputies in all the seaports should seize any ships in the ports that were from foreign countries, excluding Denmark, Norway and other countries that did not oppose John's diplomatic efforts. A gap in the governmental records does not allow a detailed view of William's activities for the next years, until 1212, when William is shown performing many of the same duties as earlier. He was in charge of repair of some ships and the construction of a large new ship, named the Deulabenit, owned by the king. <b>William</b> <b>was</b> also responsible for impressing privately owned merchant ships into royal service. These ships were used in the naval action of the Battle of Damme at Zwyn in 1213, when a fleet under William Longespee, the Earl of Salisbury, destroyed a substantial French naval force and sacked the town of Damme.|$|E
