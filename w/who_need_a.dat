5|$|The Saguna meditation, that is {{qualified}} and with attributes, {{is for those}} <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> concrete symbol such as a Murti, or a visualization aid. They should think of the identity of their lotus heart having eight petals with the highest self visualized as Vasudeva, Narayana or Purushottama. The meditation should concentrate on one's own identity with this image of imperishable highest self. This is {{the path to the}} state of Vaishvanara, or qualified Dhyana.|$|E
5|$|Grappling {{with family}} challenges, Vonnegut {{continued}} to write, publishing novels vastly dissimilar {{in terms of}} plot. The Sirens of Titan (1959) features a Martian invasion of Earth, as experienced by a bored billionaire, Malachi Constant. He meets Winston Rumfoord, an aristocratic space traveler, who is virtually omniscient but stuck in a time warp {{that allows him to}} appear on Earth every 59 days. The billionaire learns that his actions and the events of all of history are determined by a race of robotic aliens from the planet Tralfamadore, <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> replacement part that can only be produced by an advanced civilization in order to repair their spaceship and return home—human history has been manipulated to produce it. Some human structures, such as the Kremlin, are coded signals from the aliens to their ship as to how long it may expect to wait for the repair to take place. Reviewers were uncertain what to think of the book, with one comparing it to Offenbach's opera The Tales of Hoffmann.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the first}} {{community}} bicycle projects in the United States was started in Portland, Oregon in 1994 by civic and environmental activists Tom O'Keefe, Joe Keating and Steve Gunther. It took the approach of simply releasing a number of bicycles to the streets for unrestricted use. While Portland's Yellow Bike Project was successful in terms of publicity, it proved unsustainable due to theft and vandalism of the bicycles. The Yellow Bike Project was eventually terminated, and replaced with the Create A Commuter (CAC) program, which provides free secondhand bicycles to certain preselected low-income and disadvantaged people <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> bicycle {{to get to work}} or attend job training courses, and the 2016 Biketown system.|$|E

25|$|Behind the ear aids (BTE) {{consist of}} a case, an earmold or dome and a {{connection}} between them. The case contains the electronics, controls, battery, microphone(s) and often the loudspeaker. Generally, the case sits behind the pinna with the connection from the case coming down the front into the ear. The sound from the instrument can be routed acoustically or electrically to the ear. If the sound is routed electrically, the speaker (receiver) {{is located in the}} earmold or an open-fit dome, while acoustically coupled instruments use a plastic tube to deliver the sound from the case’s loudspeaker to the earmold. BTEs are also easily connected to assistive listening devices, such as FM systems, to directly integrate sound sources with the instrument. BTE aids are commonly worn by children <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> durable type of hearing aid.|$|E
25|$|In Deathly Hallows, the {{students}} <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> {{place to hide}} from the Carrows, two Death Eater professors, use the room. It is also revealed that the Room of Requirement's current version can change while still occupied, though should a completely different version be required (e.g. the Room of Hidden Things instead of DA Headquarters) the room must be empty. The Room can also answer to the desire of the wizard within the room, such as providing Harry with a whistle when he needed one during a Dumbledore's Army meeting, or creating a passage to the Hog's Head (as the room cannot produce food). Later, Ravenclaw's diadem is found to be one of Voldemort's Horcruxes and has been hidden in the Room of Hidden Things by Voldemort. Harry, Ron, and Hermione enter the Room, with Harry knowing that he must look for a place to hide things, and find the tiara; but they are ambushed by Draco, Crabbe and Goyle. The diadem is finally destroyed when Crabbe fills this version of the Room with what Hermione believes to have been Fiendfyre; a destructive magical fire. It is not known if the room continues to function after the events of Deathly Hallows; Ron expresses concern that it may have been ruined in all of its forms by the cursed fire.|$|E

[...] Kurt has twice been portrayed as a child: in the episode [...] "Grilled Cheesus", a series of flashback scenes show Kurt at the age of eight, in which the character is played by Adam Kolkin. Although Kolkin was thirteen {{at the time of the}} audition, which called for an eight-year-old, he was chosen in part because his resemblance to Colfer was [...] "so uncanny even the casting directors were taken aback". Kurt has also been shown even younger—in the episode [...] "The Substitute", club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) comes down with the flu and has a hallucination of the students as preschoolers; all twelve glee club members, including Kurt, are played by very young children.|$|E

500|$|In casting Glee, Murphy {{sought out}} actors who could {{identify}} with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway, where he found Morrison, who had previously starred on stage in Hairspray and The Light in the Piazza, Michele, who starred in Spring Awakening, and Ushkowitz, from the Broadway revival of The King and I. The role of Rachel was written specifically for Michele. Colfer had no previous professional experience, but reminded Ryan {{of the character of}} Kurt from The Sound of Music, and was thus cast as Kurt Hummel. He originally auditioned for Artie with the song [...] "Mr. Cellophane", however Murphy was so impressed by his performance that the role of Kurt was created for him. Colfer commented on his casting: [...] "I'm so happy {{to be a part of}} something that is so new and different and so needed at this time. It's good to have something positive, especially for kids in small towns, like myself, <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> little pick-me-up.

500|$|... 10 {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Jared Johnson of AllMusic gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars and noted {{it as an}} 'Album Pick', calling it [...] "one {{of the best and}} most long-awaited greatest-hits albums in recent memory". Johnson praised the amount of content, saying [...] "For fans, the videos alone make this worth picking up". Jenna DeWitt of The Baylor Lariat gave it an A-, praising [...] "I Can Only Imagine (Symphony Edition)" [...] as [...] "awe-inspiring" [...] as well as the DVD content, and saying [...] "the only mistake in buying this album is if you are really tired of the extensive radio airplay that these hits have gotten". Dave Derbyshire of Cross Rhythms gave the album nine out of ten squares, calling it a [...] "brilliant introduction" [...] to the band. His only criticism on the album was that he considered a few of the songs as being overly sentimental. Matt Johnson of Jesus Freak Hideout gave the album three out of five stars. Johnson noted the DVD content as being [...] "what really makes this worth your money", but was critical of the interface; he also felt the CD content, while solid, did not include enough songs and that the new recordings weren't particularly impressive. He noted the orchestra and Millard's vocals as conflicting on the re-recording of [...] "I Can Only Imagine", but also said that it [...] "takes the song to new heights than previously conceived". Justin Michael of Sight Magazine gave the album a positive review, calling it [...] "A must for all MercyMe fans, for those <b>who</b> <b>need</b> <b>a</b> hooky melody with a message and for people who love getting a free DVD with their albums!"; he also praised the one-camera tour videos, but noted [...] "Ten Simple Rules" [...] is [...] "not their brightest musical moment".|$|E
