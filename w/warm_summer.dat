5|$|Bottom-dwelling in nature, the marbled {{electric}} ray inhabits rocky reefs and seagrass beds, as well as nearby areas with sandy or muddy bottoms. During <b>warm</b> <b>summer</b> months, pregnant females are known to migrate into Arcachon Bay in northwestern France, where they are commonly found in very shallow, muddy pools near oyster beds. This species may conduct a northward migration in summer and autumn, into {{the waters of the}} British Isles.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{discovered}} that where the P. rebeli {{lay their eggs}} {{is based on the}} size of the G. cruciata leaves and not upon the location of the closest Myrmica ant colony. Evidence for P. rebeli oviposition depending upon the range of the food plant rather than the range of the ants is supported by the timing of its oviposition. P. rebeli lays their eggs during the <b>warm</b> <b>summer</b> season, when Myrmica ants are most likely to be underground. Researchers also observed females did not base their oviposition on where they found Myrmica nests.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, {{observations}} from Earth {{were made of}} Triton's limb as it passed in front of stars. These observations indicated {{the presence of a}} denser atmosphere than was deduced from Voyager 2 data. Other observations have shown an increase in temperature by 5% from 1989 to 1998. These observations indicate Triton is approaching an unusually <b>warm</b> <b>summer</b> season that happens only once every few hundred years. Theories for this warming include a change of frost patterns on Triton's surface and a change in ice albedo, which would allow more heat to be absorbed. Another theory argues the changes in temperature are a result of deposition of dark, red material from geological processes. Because Triton's Bond albedo is among the highest within the Solar System, it is sensitive to small variations in spectral albedo.|$|E

5|$|Minnesota has a {{continental}} climate, with hot summers and cold winters. Minnesota's {{location in the}} Upper Midwest allows it to experience some of the widest variety of weather in the United States, {{with each of the}} four seasons having its own distinct characteristics. The areas near Lake Superior in the Minnesota Arrowhead region experience weather unique {{from the rest of the}} state. The moderating effect of Lake Superior keeps the surrounding area relatively cooler in the summer and relatively warmer in the winter, giving that region a smaller yearly temperature range. On the Köppen climate classification, much of the southern third of Minnesota—roughly from the Twin Cities region southward—falls in the hot summer humid continental climate zone (Dfa), and the northern two-thirds of Minnesota falls in the <b>warm</b> <b>summer</b> great continental climate zone (Dfb).|$|E
5|$|Sunday, August 24, 1924, was a <b>warm</b> <b>summer</b> day in Brooklyn, and Helen Palsgraf, a 40-year-old janitor and housekeeper, {{was taking}} her two daughters, Elizabeth and Lillian, aged 15 and 12, to Rockaway Beach. Having paid the {{necessary}} fare, {{they were on the}} platform at the East New York station of the LIRR on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, when a train, not theirs, pulled in. As it began to move again, two men raced for the train, and one made it without incident, as the doors had not closed. The other, a man carrying a package, leapt aboard, {{with the help of a}} platform guard pushing him from behind as a member of the train's crew pulled him into the car. But in the process, the man lost the package, which dropped and exploded, for it apparently contained fireworks. Either the force of the explosion or the panicking of those on the platform caused a tall, coin-operated scale to topple onto Helen Palsgraf. No one was hurt enough to spend the night in the hospital, though several people, Palsgraf among them, were listed as injured.|$|E
5|$|The John Day River, which {{passes through}} the Sheep Rock Unit, is the longest undammed {{tributary}} of the Columbia River, although two Columbia River dams below the John Day River mouth impede migratory fish travel to some degree. Chinook salmon and steelhead pass through the monument {{on their way to}} and from upstream spawning beds and the Pacific Ocean. Species observed at the Sheep Rock Unit also include those able to tolerate <b>warm</b> <b>summer</b> river temperatures: bridgelip suckers, northern pikeminnow, redside shiners, and smallmouth bass. From October through June, when the water is cooler, Columbia River redband trout and sculpin are among species that move downriver through the park. The Park Service has removed or replaced irrigation diversions along the river or Rock Creek that formerly impeded fish movement, and it is restoring riparian vegetation such as black cottonwood trees that shade the water in summer and provide habitat for aquatic insects.|$|E

5|$|Moncton has a <b>warm</b> <b>summer</b> {{continental}} climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb) with uniform precipitation distribution. Winter days are typically cold but generally sunny with solar radiation generating some warmth. Daytime high temperatures usually range {{a few degrees}} below the freezing point. Major snowfalls can result from nor'easter ocean storms moving up {{the east coast of}} North America. These major snowfalls typically average 20–30cm (8–12in) and are frequently mixed with rain or freezing rain. Spring is frequently delayed because the sea ice that forms in the nearby Gulf of St. Lawrence during the previous winter requires time to melt, and this will cool onshore winds, which can extend inland as far as Moncton. The ice burden in the gulf has diminished considerably {{over the course of the}} last decade (which may be a consequence of global warming), and the springtime cooling effect has weakened as a result. Daytime temperatures above freezing are typical by late February. Trees are usually in full leaf by late May. Summers are hot and humid due to the seasonal prevailing westerly winds strengthening the continental tendencies of the local climate. Daytime highs sometimes reach more than 30°C (86°F). Rainfall is generally modest, especially in late July and August, and periods of drought are not uncommon. Autumn daytime temperatures remain mild until late October. First snowfalls usually do not occur until late November and consistent snow cover on the ground does not happen until late December. The Fundy coast of New Brunswick occasionally experiences the effects of post-tropical storms. The stormiest weather of the year, with the greatest precipitation and the strongest winds, usually occurs during the fall/winter transition (November to mid-January).|$|E
25|$|A {{hydrological}} drought can occur, after {{a relatively}} dry winter whereby the soil moisture storage, reservoirs and water table have not risen sufficiently {{to counteract the}} <b>warm</b> <b>summer</b> weather.

25|$|Many early natives in North America wore {{a similar}} type of footwear, {{known as the}} moccasin. These are tight-fitting, soft-soled shoes {{typically}} made out of leather or bison hides. Many moccasins were also decorated with various beads and other adornments. Moccasins were not designed to be waterproof, and in wet weather and <b>warm</b> <b>summer</b> months, most Native Americans went barefoot.|$|E

While during summer months the inland temperatures are significantly higher, Vancouver has the coolest summer average high of all major Canadian metropolitan areas. The summer months are typically dry, {{with an average of}} only one in five days during July and August receiving precipitation. In contrast, there is some precipitation during nearly half the days from November through March.|$|E
25|$|Canada has {{a diverse}} climate. The climate varies from {{temperate}} {{on the west}} coast of British Columbia to a subarctic climate in the north.

Landlocked areas tend to have a <b>warm</b> <b>summer</b> continental climate zone with the exception of Southwestern Ontario which has a hot summer humid continental climate. Parts of Western Canada have a semi-arid climate, and parts of Vancouver Island can even be classified as cool summer Mediterranean climate. Temperature extremes in Canada range from 45.0°C (113°F) in Midale and Yellow Grass, Saskatchewan on July 5, 1937 to −63.0°C (−81.4°F) in Snag, Yukon on Monday, February 3, 1947.|$|E
25|$|Triton is {{approaching}} an unusually <b>warm</b> <b>summer</b> season that only happens once every few hundred years. Elliot {{and his colleagues}} believe that Triton's warming trend could be driven by seasonal changes in the absorption of solar energy by its polar ice caps.

Bonnie J. Buratti et al. argue the changes in temperature are a result of deposition of dark, red material from geological processes on the moon, such as massive venting. Because Triton's Bond albedo is among the highest within the Solar System, it is sensitive to small variations in spectral albedo.|$|E
