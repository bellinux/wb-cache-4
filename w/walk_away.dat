5|$|I’d {{like them}} to <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> {{thinking}} it’s a film that can be interpreted {{in more than one}} way.

I’m pleased when people get that out of it.|$|E

5|$|After {{the deal}} was announced, NBA Commissioner David Stern stated that he was opposed to a relocation, as no NBA {{franchise}} had moved since 1985, when the Kansas City Kings relocated to Sacramento, California.

The NBA Board of Governors' Finance Committee also made negative statements, as the purchase agreement was structured with incentives to move the team.

5|$|As more {{virgin forest}} {{was lost to}} tavy, {{communities}} increasingly planted and cultivated permanent plots of land. By 600CE, groups of these early settlers had moved inland and begun clearing the forests of the central highlands. Rice was originally dry planted or cultivated in marshy lowland areas, which produced low yields. Irrigated rice paddies were adopted in the highlands around 1600, first in Betsileo country in the southern highlands, then later in the northern highlands of Imerina. By the time terraced paddies emerged in central Madagascar over the next century, the area's original forest cover had largely vanished. In its place were scattered villages ringed with nearby rice paddies and crop fields a day's <b>walk</b> <b>away,</b> surrounded by vast plains of sterile grasses.|$|E
