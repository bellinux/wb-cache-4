50|$|ENV {{strives to}} curb demand for <b>wildlife</b> <b>products</b> in Vietnam via Public Service Announcements (PSAs) on TV and radio. They {{concentrate}} {{their efforts on}} tigers, rhinos, bears and pangolins. The emphasis of these short infomercials is that <b>wildlife</b> trade <b>products,</b> such as pangolin scales, rhino horn and tiger bones, lack medicinal value. A recent 2016 campaign, for instance, pointed out that rhino horn is made of keratin, the same substance as human hair and nails. One would, therefore, be as well eating one's own finger nails and hair.|$|R
30|$|Illegal {{trading in}} <b>wildlife</b> <b>products</b> is {{attractive}} to criminals {{because of the potential}} financial gains with relative little costs or risks [7]. Wildlife commodity prices depend on economic processes such as demand and supply [8].

40|$|The {{global trade}} in {{wildlife}} has historically {{contributed to the}} emergence and spread of infectious diseases. The United States is the world’s largest importer of <b>wildlife</b> and <b>wildlife</b> <b>products,</b> yet minimal pathogen surveillance has precluded assessment of the health risks posed by this practice. This report details {{the findings of a}} pilot project to establish surveillance methodology for zoonotic agents in confiscated <b>wildlife</b> <b>products.</b> Initial findings from samples collected at several international airports identified parts originating from nonhuman primate (NHP) and rodent species, including baboon, chimpanzee, mangabey, guenon, green monkey, cane rat and rat. Pathogen screening identified retroviruses (simian foamy virus) and/or herpesviruses (cytomegalovirus and lymphocryptovirus) in the NHP samples. These results are the first demonstration that illegal bushmeat importation into the United States could act as a conduit for pathogen spread, and suggest that implementation of disease surveillance of the wildlife trade will help facilitate prevention of diseas...|$|R

50|$|The US {{is one of}} the world's largest {{markets for}} <b>wildlife</b> and <b>wildlife</b> <b>products.</b> High-volume 'live' traffic {{includes}} exotic reptiles, tropical fish, and primates. Manufactured products (such as boots, shoes, purses, jewelry, caviar, and meats) and less 'processed' wildlife items (such as hunting trophies, feathers, furs, skins, raw coral, and shells) are also common. Wildlife inspectors enforce a range of US and international laws, regulations, and treaties that protect wildlife and limit commercial traffic in endangered animals and plants.|$|R
50|$|Another {{major cause}} of {{poaching}} {{is due to the}} cultural high demand of <b>wildlife</b> <b>products,</b> such as ivory, that are seen as symbols of status and wealth in China. According to Joseph Vandegrift, China saw an unusual spike in demand for ivory in the twenty-first century due to the economic boom that allowed more middle-class Chinese to have a higher purchasing power that incentivized them to show off their newfound wealth using ivory, a rare commodity since the Han Dynasty.|$|R
