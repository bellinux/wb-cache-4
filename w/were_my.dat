25|$|The doctor {{warned me}} – {{and so did}} members of my family soon {{afterward}} – that if I did not keep my epilepsy a secret, people would fear me and I {{would be subject to}} discrimination. Even now, seven years after that scene in the dining hall, it is difficult for me to say that I have epilepsy. Back then, it was impossible. In the years since, I have had hundreds of various types of seizures. I have experienced the mental, physical and emotional side effects caused by changes in the anticonvulsant drugs I take each day. Yet, for the first two years, I refused to learn about epilepsy. My fears of being found out <b>were</b> <b>my</b> real concern.|$|E

500|$|Timberlake and Scott Storch wrote [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] with Timbaland, who {{produced}} the song. Storch found working with Timberlake easy {{because of the}} song's meaning. Reporters believed its lyrics were inspired by Timberlake's romantic relationship with American recording artist Britney Spears, which ended in 2002. Timberlake told MTV News, [...] "I'm not going to specifically say if any song is about anybody. I will say writing a couple of songs on the record helped me deal {{with a couple of}} things. To me songs are songs. They can stem from things that completely happened to you personally or they can stem from ideas that you think could happen to you." [...] In December 2011, Timberlake admitted that he had written [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] after an argument with Spears: [...] "I was on a phone call that was not the most enjoyable phone call. I walked into the studio and he [...] could tell I was visibly angry." [...] Timbaland recalled, [...] "I was like, 'Man, don't worry about it' and he was like, 'I can't believe she did that to me' and he was like, 'You <b>were</b> <b>my</b> sun, you <b>were</b> <b>my</b> earth'".|$|E

[...] While basketball player Michael Jordan was Scott's childhood sports idol, he says Jordan was not the inspiration for his jersey number of 23. Scott chose it as a combination of his older brothers' high school numbers: James wore number 20, and Lee, Jr. wore number 3. Scott said, [...] "They <b>were</b> <b>my</b> father." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his past. A Rolling Stone {{reviewer}} called the song a [...] "breakup aria". According to Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian, [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] stands out for its [...] "slow-building sense of drama", which highlights Timberlake at his [...] "husky best". The song begins with the phrase [...] "You <b>were</b> <b>my</b> sun, you <b>were</b> <b>my</b> earth", which according to Timbaland was Timberlake's inspiration to write the song. Tanya L. Edwards of MTV News observed that Timberlake was wronged and said this is demonstrated by the lyrics: [...] "You don't have to say whatcha did / I already know, I found out from him / Now there's just no chance." [...] The chorus contains the lines: [...] "Told me you loved me, {{why did you leave}} me all alone / Now you tell me you need me when you call me on the phone." [...] Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani called Timberlake's 2007 single [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around" [...] an ostensible sequel to [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] both lyrically and musically. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard stated that aside from the presence of Timbaland's [...] "fantastically cluttered production", the difference between [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] and Timberlake's 2013 single [...] "Mirrors" [...] is clear: [...] "10 years ago, Timberlake was broken, and now he is whole".|$|E

[...] Bell later recalled: [...] "Those two games against Ohio State <b>were</b> <b>my</b> biggest, and I consider the second game a personal victory.

500|$|On February 26, 2010, the Ethics Committee {{issued its}} report. [...] It {{determined}} that Rangel had violated House gift rules, by accepting reimbursement for his {{travel to the}} conferences. [...] It found {{that he had not}} known of the contributions, but concluded that he was still responsible for them and was required to repay their cost. [...] Five other members were cleared of having violated rules, but were also required to repay their trips. [...] Rangel disagreed with the committee's finding, saying: Because they <b>were</b> <b>my</b> staff members who knew, one of whom has been discharged, [...] that I should have known. Common sense dictates that members of Congress should not be held responsible for what could be the wrongdoing, or mistakes, or errors of staff.|$|E
500|$|Bruce, a boyhood fan of Newcastle United, {{claims to}} have sneaked into St James' Park without paying to watch the team play, saying [...] "I {{have always been a}} Newcastle lad and when I was a kid, I crawled under the {{turnstiles}} to get in to try and save a bob or whatever it was.

[...] Like several other future professionals from the area, he played football for Wallsend Boys Club.

500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was shot on a stretch of beach {{on the coast of}} California in Malibu and {{directed}} by Marcus Raboy. In an interview with MTV News, Rihanna spoke about the development of the shoot for the video, saying [...] "The water was so cold... but oh my gosh, we had so much fun... We were bumping each other off the Jet Skis and just had a ball". During the interview, the singer elaborated further upon the content of the video and the meaning behind it, saying [...] "This video is about having fun, giving off the vibe of the Caribbean... we did some mermaid-looking stuff down on the sand...and I'm just [...] to the camera as if it <b>were</b> <b>my</b> boyfriend. Now we're going to do [...] the Tiki torches. It's going to be incredible". [...] The dance routines in the video were choreographed by noted choreographer Fatima Robinson.|$|E
500|$|To {{support the}} new album, Blink-182 created {{an entirely new}} logo, a [...] "smiley face" [...] with Xs for each eye and five arrows {{on the left side}} of its face. According to Barker, the Blink-182 logo {{originated}} at his clothing line, Famous Stars and Straps. Barker wanted to brand an icon for the band: [...] "It just had to be a cool kind of happy face but I wanted arrows. You know, like The Jam <b>were</b> <b>my</b> favorite band, they always had arrows in their logos and stuff. It was just kind of inspired by pop-art." [...] Hoppus seconded this sentiment: [...] "He spearheaded all the artwork for the record. There were smiley-face stickers and posters all over Los Angeles, and that was his idea." [...] Barker invited his tattoo artist, Mister Cartoon, to create artwork for the record, and his good friend Estevan Oriol to handle photography. [...] "His style, incorporated into Blink's, didn’t make us too gangster: it just gave us a bit of an edge. It was cool to feel like Blink had a dangerous side", Barker later remembered.|$|E
