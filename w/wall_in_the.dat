5|$|The {{historic}} Fort at Lahaina, {{facing the}} Lahaina Harbor, is now {{represented by a}} partial reconstruction at the southern corner of the park. Lahaina Fort was demolished in 1854.

5|$|Although {{there were}} various small incidents, three major {{accidents}} {{led to a}} red flag for the session. The No. 13 Courage Compétition entry, driven by Guillaume Moreau, went off at the Porsche Curves during the second hour. The car could {{not return to the}} test session due a bent chassis caused by the heavy impact. The second red flag involved the No. 24 Noël del Bello entry going off the track at the same location in the hands of Vitaly Petrov, becoming briefly airborne after contact with the concrete <b>wall.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> final incident, almost in the last hour of the session, the No. 10 Arena Motorsports Zytek also went off at the Porsche Curves, and briefly caught fire.|$|E

5|$|Athenian {{girls were}} not {{formally}} educated; instead, their mothers taught them the domestic {{skills necessary for}} running a household. Formal education for boys consisted of rhetoric, necessary for effective political participation, and physical education in preparation for military service. These skills were not considered necessary for women, who were barred from learning them. Classical art indicates that girls and boys played with toys such as spinning tops, hoops, and seesaws, and played games such as piggyback. The gravestone of Plangon, an Athenian girl aged about five {{which is in the}} Glyptothek museum in Munich, shows her holding a doll; a set of knucklebones hangs on a <b>wall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> background.|$|E

5|$|During the campaign, Mugabe survived two {{assassination}} attempts. In the first, {{which took}} place on 6 February, a grenade was thrown at his Mount Pleasant home, where it exploded against a garden <b>wall.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second, on 10 February, a roadside bomb exploded near his motorcade as he left a Fort Victoria rally. Mugabe himself was unharmed. Mugabe accused the Rhodesian security forces of being responsible for these attacks. In an attempt to quell the possibility that Rhodesia's security forces would launch a coup to prevent the election, Mugabe met with Peter Walls, the commander of Rhodesia's armed forces, {{and asked him to}} remain in his position {{in the event of a}} ZANU-PF victory. At the time Walls refused.|$|E

5|$|Europeans first {{witnessed}} the Great <b>Wall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1600s. Perhaps the first recorded instance of a European actually entering China via the Great Wall came in 1605, when the Portuguese Jesuit brother Bento de Góis reached the northwestern Jiayu Pass from India. Ivan Petlin's 1619 deposition for his Russian embassy mission offers an early account {{based on a}} first-hand encounter with the Great Wall, and mentions that {{in the course of}} the journey his embassy travelled alongside the Great Wall for ten days.|$|E
5|$|Filming of {{the second}} season's {{southern}} scenes shifted from Malta to Croatia, where the city of Dubrovnik and nearby locations allowed exterior shots of a walled, coastal medieval city. The Walls of Dubrovnik and Fort Lovrijenac were used for scenes in King's Landing and the Red Keep. The island of Lokrum, the St. Dominic monastery in the coastal town of Trogir, the Rector's Palace in Dubrovnik, and the Dubac quarry (a few kilometers east) were used for scenes set in Qarth. Scenes set north of the <b>Wall,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Frostfangs and at the Fist of the First Men, were filmed in November 2011 in Iceland: on the Vatnajökull glacier near Smyrlabjörg, the Svínafellsjökull glacier near Skaftafell and the Mýrdalsjökull glacier near Vik on Höfðabrekkuheiði.|$|E
5|$|In 1909 {{the hunger}} strike {{was added to}} the WSPU's {{repertoire}} of resistance. On 24 June Marion Wallace Dunlop was arrested for writing an excerpt from the Bill of Rights (1688 or 1689) on a <b>wall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Commons. Angered by the conditions of the jail, Dunlop went on a hunger strike. When it proved effective, fourteen women imprisoned for smashing windows began to fast. WSPU members soon became known around the country for holding prolonged hunger strikes to protest their incarceration. Prison authorities frequently force-fed the women, using tubes inserted through the nose or mouth. The painful techniques (which, in the case of mouth-feeding, required the use of steel gags to force the mouth open) brought condemnation from suffragists and medical professionals.|$|E

5|$|In 842 and 851, Canterbury {{suffered}} {{great loss}} of life during Danish raids. In 978, Archbishop Dunstan refounded the abbey built by Augustine, and named it St Augustine's Abbey. A second wave of Danish attacks began in 991, and in 1011 the cathedral was burnt and Archbishop Alphege was killed in 1012. Remembering the destruction caused by the Danes, the inhabitants of Canterbury did not resist William the Conqueror's invasion in 1066. William immediately ordered a wooden motte-and-bailey castle to be built by the Roman city <b>wall.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early 12th century, the castle was rebuilt with stone.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, the {{eastbound}} Circle line platform {{was taken}} out of use and the track layout was rearranged to remove the westbound Circle line track and widen the island platform. The eastbound Circle and District lines both serve {{the north side of the}} island platform and the westbound Circle line which was redirected to serve the south side of the island platform. The disused platform is used for Art on the Underground installations, often placed into the brick recesses in the northern retaining <b>wall.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1990s a deck was constructed above the District and Circle line platforms on which was constructed a shopping mall and apartment building.|$|E
5|$|Jones's {{recommendations}} were immediately accepted {{and put into}} practice. A series of new batteries aligned on a roughly north-south axis facing west towards the harbour was constructed, including Jones', Civil Hospital, Raglan's, Gardiner's, Queen Victoria's, Lady Augusta's, Prince of Wales and Cumberland batteries. Further batteries and fortifications were constructed around Rosia Bay near {{the south of the}} peninsula and Windmill Hill was strengthened around its entire perimeter, with Retrenched Barracks at its north end blocking access to the higher ground behind. The sea <b>wall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town was straightened and strengthened with the building of two new curtain walls, Prince Albert's Front and Wellington Front. Defensive breakwaters were constructed in front of both to prevent an armoured enemy ship ramming the walls.|$|E
