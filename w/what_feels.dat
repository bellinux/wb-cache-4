500|$|Writing for Digital Spy, Robert Copsey {{questioned}} Cyrus' {{decision to}} premiere a ballad {{in the midst}} of controversies regarding her [...] "salacious exploits", but enjoyed the song itself and opined that it [...] "proves that there's method behind the madness." [...] In a more mixed review, Joseph Atilano from the Philippine Daily Inquirer appreciated the lyrics for seeming heartfelt, but felt that its production was [...] "comparatively weaker" [...] by comparison to her earlier projects. Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times felt that the track proved that Cyrus [...] "isn't just a twerk-bot programmed to titillate", but suggested that her [...] "singing throbs with <b>what</b> <b>feels</b> like an embarrassment of emotion" [...] and found it peculiar that the song discussed the singer's relationship with Hemsworth when her public behavior seemingly suggested that she [...] "couldn't care less about" [...] it.|$|E

500|$|The {{game was}} {{critically}} acclaimed by critics, with several noting that New Super Mario Bros. {{was one of}} the best games available for the Nintendo DS. GameZone believed that it was the [...] "hot game" [...] to purchase for any DS owner, noting its [...] "huge exploration potential" [...] and reinvention of the platform game genre. Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer stated, [...] "I've done this sort of thing before hundreds of times across thousands of days in <b>what</b> <b>feels</b> like a dozen Mario games. I still love it." [...] Believing that experienced players would require very little time to complete the game, GameSpot nevertheless considered New Super Mario Bros. a [...] "completely awesome" [...] game that was an [...] "absolutely necessary" [...] video game to own. GamesRadar considered the game a bargain, noting that it included [...] "a completely solid solo game, a simple-but-exciting two-player, and then a collection of super-quick stylus games".|$|E
500|$|Amidst {{speculation}} of rifts between Dempsey and Pompeo, {{and even}} show runner Rhimes, the former maintained his stance of leaving in a [...] "very good" [...] place with his co-star of ten years. On his relationships with Pompeo in particular, he said [...] "it’s beautiful. We’re like a married couple. It’s 10 years, {{and it was}} magic from the beginning. Chemistry right away.” He thanked his fans on Twitter and wrote, [...] "I {{want to thank all}} the fans, what an incredible 11 yrs, I love you all." [...] Rhimes asserted on the importance of Dempsey's character in the statement she released at his departure: “Derek Shepherd is and will always be an incredibly important character—for Meredith, for me and for the fans. I absolutely never imagined saying goodbye to our ‘McDreamy.’ As Ellis Grey would say: the carousel never stops turning.” Pompeo too took to Twitter to react to the death of Shepherd and wrote, [...] "I am honored and excited {{to tell the story of}} how Meredith goes on in the face of <b>what</b> <b>feels</b> like the impossible. I hope you will all join me on her journey.” It was the first time she spoke out publicly about Dempsey's publicised exit.|$|E
500|$|Limbo was {{generally}} praised for its puzzle {{design and the}} simplicity of its controls. Jake Gaskill of G4 TV {{was impressed by the}} complexity of the puzzles based on the two simple actions of jumping and grabbing onto objects, similar to LittleBigPlanet, with a variety of elements to assure [...] "you're always facing something new and challenging" [...] during the game. Game Informer Matt Miller commented that part of the success of Limbo is that [...] "every one of these [...] stands alone"; the game accomplishes this in Miller's opinion by varying the elements throughout the game, and preventing the player from getting too accustomed to similar solutions since [...] "everything changes". GameSpy's Ryan Scott believed that the game empowered the player to work through solutions themselves, and its puzzle design, [...] "with its elegant simplicity, offers up <b>what</b> <b>feels</b> like a world of meaningful possibilities". The frequency of death was not considered a distraction from the game; not only were the deaths seen as necessary as part of learning and overcoming each obstacle, but reviewers found the checkpoints where the player would restart to be plentiful throughout the game. Will Freeman of The Guardian praised the game but noted that beyond the [...] "smoke and mirrors" [...] of Limbo artwork, the game is [...] "undermined by the title's lack of innovative gameplay", which he says has been seen in earlier platform games.|$|E

[...] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone, who had a similar opinion to Phares', called the track a [...] "starkly beautiful album opener".

2500|$|Chair of the Annapolis Group, and {{president}} of Gettysburg College, Katherine Haley Will, discussed this decision further in a 9 July 2007 article for The Washington Post. [...] In this article, Hill states that this decision was not based upon [...] "a lack of concern about providing accurate, comprehensive information to help {{students and their families}} make decisions about college." [...] Rather, she argued against the methodology of the U.S. News rankings. In particular, she argues against [...] "the largest single factor in the U.S. News rating formula" [...] which is the reputational survey as, [...] "it is unrealistic to expect academic officials to know enough about hundreds of institutions to fairly evaluate the quality of their programs." [...] Hill then argues that, [...] "by contrast, 1 percent of the U.S. News ratings formula is assigned to student-to-faculty ratios, which many faculty members and students consider {{the most important factor in}} educational experience." [...] Hill states that the members of the Annapolis Group will offer the same information in an alternative, free, format which will not rank schools, as, [...] "an educational experience can't be reduced to one number, a school's so-called rank. The simplicity of a rank is understandably more appealing than spending hours poring over college catalogues and visiting campuses, but myriad complex variables can't be reduced to a single number." [...] Instead, Hill asks students and parents to [...] "compare schools on a variety of factors [...] they should visit campuses and go on <b>what</b> <b>feels</b> like a good match rather than relying on filtered or secondhand information. We must encourage students to look inside their hearts and trust their instincts when it comes to choosing a college, not whether parents or friends think a university is cool or prestigious." ...|$|E

6000|$|This last story ended, it {{is settled}} {{that we shall}} descend again to the beach. Stimulated by {{the ease with which}} my worthy leader goes down beneath me, I get over-confident in my dexterity, and begin to slip here, and slide there, and come to awkward pauses at precipitous places, in what would be rather an {{alarming}} manner, but for the potent presence of the guide, who is always beneath me, ready to be fallen upon. Sometimes, when I am holding on with all the necessary tenacity of grip, as regards my hands, but, [...] "scrambling my toes about" [...] in a very disorderly and unworkmanlike fashion, he pops his head up from below for me to sit on; and puts my feet into crevices for me, with many apologies for taking the liberty! Sometimes, I fancy myself treading on <b>what</b> <b>feels</b> like soft turf; I look down, and find that I am standing like an acrobat on his shoulders, and hear him civilly entreating me to take hold of his jacket next, and let myself down over his body to the ledge where he is waiting for me. He never makes a false step, never stumbles, scrambles, hesitates, or fails to have a hand always at my service. The nautical metaphor of [...] "holding on by your eyelids" [...] becomes a fact in his case. He really views his employer, as porters are expected to view a package labelled [...] "glass with care." [...] I am firmly persuaded that he could take a drunken man up and down Asparagus Island, without the slightest risk either to himself or his charge; and I hold him in no small admiration, when, after landing on the sand with something between a tumble and a jump, I find him raising me to my perpendicular almost before I have touched the ground, and politely hoping that I feel quite satisfied, hitherto, with his conduct as a guide.|$|E
