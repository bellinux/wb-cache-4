5|$|Solar 2 {{is an open}} world sandbox {{video game}} played from a {{two-dimensional}} perspective. The player is given an asteroid, and their main mission is to accumulate enough mass to become several astronomical objects. The game ends <b>when</b> <b>and</b> <b>if</b> the player manages to accumulate enough mass to become a big crunch, which then produces a Big Bang. However, the player is free to not finish the game, {{and is able to}} stay at the form of the object of their preference. Six different object are available in the game: small planet, life planet, small star, medium star, large star and black hole.|$|E
5|$|The trophy was {{not without}} {{precedent}} in Major League baseball: the Dauvray Cup (named after actress Helen Dauvray) was awarded to {{the winner of the}} World Series between the National League and the American Association from 1887 to 1890, and from 1891 to 1893, when a solitary major league remained, to the winner of the National League pennant. The Dauvray Cup was to be held by the victorious team, and was to be relinquished the following year <b>when</b> (<b>and</b> <b>if)</b> a new champion team emerged. The Dauvray Cup mysteriously vanished following the 1893 series and has never been located. From 1894 to 1897, the Temple Cup was awarded to the winner of a postseason contest between the two top National League clubs.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{uncertainty}} in forecasting <b>when</b> <b>and</b> <b>if</b> Emily would make its northeast turn, Virginia Governor Douglas Wilder {{declared a state of}} emergency and put the National Guard on alert. In Virginia Beach, residents of seaside homes and low-lying areas were recommended to evacuate, while a mandatory evacuation was ordered for Tangier Island in the Chesapeake Bay. Residents in mobile homes and on campgrounds were also advised to seek shelter. At least 750people left their homes, 711 of whom resided in storm shelters. The Norfolk International Airport was closed for 13hours, and rail service was suspended. To the north, officials in Ocean City, Maryland, declared a phase-one emergency ahead of the storm; beaches were closed, and tourists were recommended to leave. About 100,000people evacuated from the coast of Maryland; 3,600 stayed in storm shelters. In Delaware, 892people used storm shelters after voluntarily evacuating. Beaches in New Jersey closed due to threatening waves. About 20,000people also evacuated from Fire Island, New York. Across the Atlantic coast, 33emergency shelters were opened in response to Emily, though most evacuees instead relied on hotels or the homes of friends and relatives to ride out the storm.|$|E

25|$|In this context, {{the most}} useful measure of {{profitability}} is Return on capital (ROC).

25|$|The Catholic Church {{teaches that}} the {{individual}} and integral confession and absolution (as opposed to collective absolution) is the only ordinary {{way in which a}} person conscious of mortal sins committed after baptism can be reconciled with God and the Church.

25|$|The 2016 Shoreham Airshow was cancelled. The organisers {{added that}} the {{possibility}} of a 2017 airshow would be explored <b>when</b> <b>and</b> <b>if</b> it was appropriate to do so. In January 2017, it was announced that the 2017 Shoreham Airshow would not take place. Doubt was expressed about an airshow taking place at Shoreham in 2018. The 2016 Llandudno Airshow was cancelled, {{due to a lack of}} time to make changes in light of new regulations introduced by the CAA. The organisers intend that the 2017 airshow will go ahead. For the 2016 Farnborough Airshow, the Red Arrows performed a flypast rather than an aerobatic display, stating that the latter would not be appropriate in the aftermath of the Shoreham accident.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the guards}} {{were able to}} get into the cells, they {{stripped}} the inmates naked, tore apart the beds and the cell, and put the prisoners who had started the rebellion in solitary confinement. As all nine guards could not be on duty at once, they began rewarding the prisoners for good behavior. The prisoners who had not been involved in starting the riot were allowed to lie in their beds, wash themselves and brush their teeth and eat while those who had started the riot were not allowed to. The guards continued to use tormenting tactics to divide the prisoners and forestall further organized resistance. In the case of one prisoner, who was a smoker, the guards were able to control his behavior because they decided <b>when</b> <b>and</b> <b>if</b> he was allowed to smoke.|$|E

25|$|Many systems {{also support}} a {{low-power}} sleep mode {{in which the}} processing functions of the machine are powered down, using a little power to preserve the contents of RAM and support waking up. Instantaneous resumption {{is one of the}} advantages of sleep mode over hibernation. A hibernated system must start up and read data back to RAM, which typically takes time. A system in sleep mode only needs to power up the CPU and display, which is almost instantaneous. On the other hand, a system in sleep mode still consumes power to keep the data in the RAM. Detaching power from a system in sleep mode results in data loss, while cutting the power of a system in hibernation has no risk; the hibernated system can resume <b>when</b> <b>and</b> <b>if</b> the power is restored. Both shut down and hibernated systems may consume standby power unless they are unplugged.|$|E
25|$|Double {{depression}} {{occurs when}} a person experiences a major depressive episode {{on top of the}} already-existing condition of dysthymia. It is difficult to treat, as sufferers accept these major depressive symptoms as a natural part of their personality or as a part of their life that is outside of their control. The fact that people with dysthymia may accept these worsening symptoms as inevitable can delay treatment. <b>When</b> <b>and</b> <b>if</b> such people seek out treatment, the treatment may not be very effective if only the symptoms of the major depression are addressed, but not the dysthymic symptoms. Patients with double depression tend to report significantly higher levels of hopelessness than is normal. This can be a useful symptom for mental health services providers to focus on when working with patients to treat the condition. Additionally, cognitive therapies can be effective for working with people with double depression in order to help change negative thinking patterns and give individuals a new way of seeing themselves and their environment.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish {{experience}} began a late {{surge in}} interest of close support aircraft in Luftwaffe. In {{the first years}} of the Nazi state these types remained a low-priority for air planners who shaped the embryonic Luftwaffe. This apparent regression from the practices and experiences of World War I stemmed from the belief among the General Staff (Oberkommando der Luftwaffe) that army support aviation in 1917–1918 was purely a reaction to trench warfare. The German Heer did not insist the Luftwaffe change it's approach at this time either. German air doctrine remained rooted in the fundamentals of Operativer Luftkrieg (Operational Air War) which stressed interdiction, Strategic bombing (<b>when</b> <b>and</b> <b>if</b> possible) but primarily the air supremacy mission. The Spanish experience encouraged the General Staff to embrace the dive-bomber concept, for which Richthofen was partly responsible, but the influence of the conflict on German operational preferences remain ambiguous. On the eve of World War II, German air planners regarded the dive-bomber as a strategic weapon to strike with precision at enemy industry. Even factored into the army support groups, only fifteen percent of Luftwaffe front-line strength contained specialist ground-attack aircraft in September 1939.|$|E
