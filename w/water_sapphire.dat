5000|$|Shadowchild [...] A small supernatural creature, {{unsure of}} what it is and wanting to know. There is a running gag based on Digger assuring the Shadowchild of various {{unlikely}} things it definitely is not, e.g.: a leaf; a <b>water</b> <b>sapphire.</b> Shadowchild is, apparently, a demon and has some disturbing powers, but it seems friendly and well-intentioned. Shadowchild recently left the series after an encounter with the demon Sweetgrass-Voice, who attempted to get it to eat its friends. Shadowchild then ate it, causing it to grow. It said goodbye to Digger before going to attempt to persuade other demons to be peaceful or die trying.|$|E
50|$|Feeling {{replaced}} and sad, {{they are}} about to leave when they learn of the tide knot, a stone that controls the tides that is becoming loose. Shortly, after they return, the tide knot loosens and nearly the entire town floods. As the houses are swallowed up by the flood <b>water,</b> <b>Sapphire's</b> mum is ill. Sapphire, her mum and her friend Rainbow go up to the attic. Sapphire jumps out of the window into the sea where she meets Conor and Faro. Sapphire is slammed against a wall and her leg begins to bleed. Conor calls Elvira, a healer. Elvira heals Sapphire and together the four help Saldowr, the wisest of the mer and the keeper of the tide knot, to put the broken pieces back together to restore the tide knot. Saldowr is weak but they manage to do it with Conor's power of reading the stone. The flood slowly recedes.|$|R
60|$|I {{shall not}} attempt to recount the details of our {{intercourse}} during the week that followed. There were moments of stress and strain when {{it seemed to me}} that we could not wait, moments that strengthened Nancy's resolution to leave immediately for the East: there were other, calmer periods when the wisdom of her going appealed to me, since our ultimate union would be hastened thereby. We overcame by degrees the distastefulness of the discussion of ways and means.... We spent an unforgettable Sunday among the distant high hills, beside a little lake of our own discovery, its glinting <b>waters</b> <b>sapphire</b> and chrysoprase. A grassy wood road, at the inviting entrance to which we left the automobile, led down through an undergrowth of laurel to a pebbly shore, and there we lunched; there we lingered through the long summer afternoon, Nancy with her back against a tree, I with my head in her lap gazing up at filmy clouds drifting imperceptibly across the sky, listening to the droning notes of the bees, notes that sometimes rose in a sharp crescendo, and again were suddenly hushed. The smell of the wood-mould mingled with the fainter scents of wild flowers. She had brought along a volume by a modern poet: the verses, as Nancy read them, moved me,--they were filled with a new faith to which my being responded, the faith of the forth-farer; not the faith of the anchor, but of the sail. I repeated some of the lines as indications of a creed to which I had long been trying to convert her, though lacking the expression. She had let the book fall on the grass. I remember how she smiled down at me with the wisdom of the ages in her eyes, seeking my hand with a gesture that was almost maternal.|$|R
60|$|Without an instant's {{hesitation}} {{he brought}} the sloop about and headed her for the light-ship on Brenton's reef, and they sailed in silence. Awhile she watched the <b>sapphire</b> <b>waters</b> break to dazzling whiteness under the westerning sun. Then, in an ecstasy she did not seek to question, {{she closed her eyes}} to feel more keenly the swift motion of their flight. Why not? The sea, the winds of heaven, had aided others since the dawn of history. Legend was eternally true. On these very shores happiness had awaited those who had dared to face primeval things.|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this paper, we {{describe}} an optical geometry that facilitates our further {{characterization of the}} temperature changes above silver island films (SiFs) on sapphire plates, when exposed to microwave radiation. Since sapphire transmits IR, we designed an optical scheme to capture real-time temperature images of a thin <b>water</b> film on <b>sapphire</b> plates with and without SiFs during {{the application of a}} short microwave pulse. Using this optical scheme, we can accu-rately determine the temperature profile of solvents in proximity to metal structures when exposed to microwave irradiation. We believe that this optical scheme will provide us with a basis for further studies in designing metal structures to further improve plasmonic-fluorescence clinical sensing applications, such as those used in microwave accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence (MAMEF) ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{report on}} the first in-situ sum {{frequency}} generation (SFG) spectroscopy characterization of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) interfacial interactions with air, <b>sapphire,</b> <b>water,</b> and heptane. Using the shift in the resonance frequency of CN at various interfaces, we demonstrated that PAN interacts with the surface hydroxyl of sapphire substrate through the lone pair orbital of nitrogen in the “end-on ” configuration (σ-H bond). We also demonstrated that the CN-CN interaction {{is the main reason}} for the superior chemical resistance property of PAN. At room temperature the interaction between the polymer chains is much stronger than the interaction between the polymer and solvent molecules including water and heptane. At high temperatures, however, the interaction between the nitrile groups of the polymer weakens, making interaction possible between the nitrile groups and the surface hydroxyls of the substrate and water. These results provide an important insight as to why acrylonitrile when copolymerized with butadiene to form nitrile rubber results in one of the best known synthetic oil-resistant rubber. 1...|$|R

60|$|He {{covered his}} face with his hands and moaned. But he started up, the night seemed less black; he looked intently; yes, he could {{distinguish}} the outlines of the pillars dimly, so dimly that he thought he saw them only in imagination. And soon he could see distinctly their massive shapes against the surrounding darkness. And as gradually the night thinned away into dim twilight, he saw that the columns were different from those at the entrance of the cavern; they were no longer covered with weed and slime, the marble was polished and smooth; and the water beneath him appeared less black. The skiff went on so swiftly that the perpetual sequence of the pillars tired his eyes; but their grim severity gave way to round columns less forbidding and more graceful; as the light grew clearer, there was almost a tinge of blue in the water. Amyntas was filled with wonder, for the columns became lighter and more decorated, surmounted by capitals, adorned with strange sculptures. Some were green and some were red, others were yellow or glistening white; they mirrored themselves in the <b>sapphire</b> <b>water.</b> Gradually the roof raised itself and the columns became more slender; from them sprang lofty arches, gorgeously ornamented, and all was gold and silver and rich colour. The water turned to a dazzling, translucent blue, so that Amyntas could see hundreds of feet down to the bottom, and the bottom was covered with golden sand. And the light grew and grew till it was more brilliant than the clearest day; gradually the skiff slowed down and it swam leisurely towards the light's source, threading its way beneath the horse-shoe arches among the columns, and these gathered themselves into two lines to form a huge avenue surmounted by a vast span, and at the end, in a splendour of light, Amyntas saw a wondrous palace, with steps leading down to the water. The boat glided towards it and at the steps ceased moving.|$|R
