5|$|President Dmitry Medvedev {{announced}} in May 2010 that the Russian government would strongly consider purchasing electricity generated from {{renewable energy sources}} {{in an attempt to}} encourage development of renewable energy. The government has plans for 4.5% of Russia's energy output to come from non-hydroelectric renewable energy sources. Additionally, in November 2010, the government approved a US$300billion program to make factories and buildings more energy efficient; it also announced plans to construct eight energy-efficient lamp production plants, promote recycling and support the construction of a hybrid car plant. Medvedev {{announced in}} late 2009 that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> Russian energy consumption by 40% by 2020. At the moment, development is slowed by low investment, economic instability, low public demand and low tariffs on heat and electricity. Subsidies for natural gas are another obstacle to renewable energy development.|$|E
5|$|Type-0 was {{released}} on October 27, 2011, receiving both physical and digital releases. It was initially announced for release in summer of that year, but unspecified difficulties with development including the stoppage of PlayStation Network caused a delay. It was then announced for released on October 13, but was delayed by two weeks. While Square Enix stated it wanted to improve its quality, no other information was given. It was speculated {{to be due to}} complaints surrounding the camera control and other gameplay elements. The releases of the soundtrack and the theme song were also delayed. Type-0 was one of a few releases for the PSP to be released on two UMDs, as Tabata <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> as little content as possible, which would have been impossible if they had settled for using one UMD. A demo for the original game {{was released}} in August 2011, featuring seven playable characters and four missions at locked difficulty levels. Sava data could be transferred to the full game, unlocking special costumes and items and keeping experience points. A second demo {{was released on}} November 22, a month after the full game's release. It replaced the original demo and gave players access to exclusive items and costumes. A collector's edition was released exclusively through Square Enix's online store, containing artwork, a limited edition version of the soundtrack, postcards and a booklet of character introductions. The title was later added to their Ultimate Hits budget title collection.|$|E

25|$|For {{the next}} couple of days No. 5 Commando carried out patrols {{throughout}} the peninsula as the enemy were cleared from the area, before they were withdrawn back to the beachhead for a couple of days rest. After this the brigade captured the village of Kantha as a preliminary move on Kangow, across a number of waterways on the mainland, where Christison had decided that he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> the Japanese line of withdrawal. The terrain was difficult with no roads and consisting of mangrove swamps and rice paddies that prevented tanks or artillery coming ashore initially. The whole area was dominated by a small wooded ridge known as Hill 170.|$|E

25|$|While the paroled prisoners, {{primarily}} from the states of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Virginia, were brought from the parole camp to Sultana, a mechanic was brought down {{to work on the}} leaky boiler. Although the mechanic <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> out and replace a ruptured seam, Mason knew that such a job would take a few days and cost him his precious load of prisoners. By the time the repairs would be completed, the prisoners would have been sent home on other boats. Instead, Mason and his chief engineer, Nathan Wintringer, convinced the mechanic to make temporary repairs, hammering back the bulged boiler plate and riveting a patch of lesser thickness over the seam. Instead of taking two or three days, the temporary repair took only one. During her time in port, and while the repair was being made, Sultana took on the paroled prisoners.|$|E

500|$|By February 18, {{the film}} {{had been cut}} to 9,204 feet. It had two advance previews in January 1938, where it {{received}} either As or A-pluses on audience-feedback cards. Producer Pandro S. Berman <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> five more minutes, but relented when Hawks, Grant and Cliff Reid objected. At the film's second preview, the film received rave reviews and RKO expected a hit. The film's musical score is minimal, primarily Grant and Hepburn singing [...] "I Can't Give You Anything But Love, Baby". There is incidental music in the Ritz scene, and an arrangement of [...] "I Can't Give You Anything But Love, Baby" [...] during the opening and closing credits by musical director Roy Webb.|$|E
500|$|Under Burton's direction, Broyles wrote another draft, but his {{script was}} {{projected}} at a $200 million budget. Fox <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> it to $100 million. In August 2000, {{two months before}} principal photography, Fox brought Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal for rewrites. Broyles [...] "had {{a lot of respect}} with the work they [...] did. And to think that given what I'd done and given what Tim wanted, they navigated the right course." [...] One of the considered endings had Leo Davidson crash-landing at Yankee Stadium, witnessing apes playing baseball. Various alternatives were considered before the filmmakers decided on the final one. The production of Planet of the Apes was a difficult experience for Burton. This was largely contributed by Fox's adamant release date (July 2001), which meant that everything from pre-production to editing and visual effects work was rushed.|$|E

500|$|British Airways was re-equipping {{several of}} its {{aircraft}} tug tractors, and the crew managed to purchase a 635 hp Hunslet ATT 77 tug to use as the armored personnel carrier. It initially weighed , and although the crew removed [...] of lead ballast, the power station floor had to be reinforced to support the weight. The crew used many [...] "junk" [...] items in the set designs, such as Ripley's toilet, which came from a Boeing707. Lockers, helicopter engines, and vending machines were used as set elements in the opening hypersleep scene. Production designer Peter Lamont was asked {{to reduce the cost}} of several scenes, including the not-yet-filmed space marine hypersleep sequence. Gale Hurd <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> the scene altogether, but Lamont and Cameron felt it was important to the sequence of the film. To save on cost, only four hypersleep chambers were created, and a mirror was used to create the illusion that there were twelve in the scene. Instead of using hydraulics, the chambers were opened and closed by wires operated by puppeteers.|$|E
500|$|Durant {{entered the}} 2009 {{season as the}} club's {{starting}} quarterback, but head coach Ken Miller gave backup Jyles significant playing time as well. Durant {{made the most of}} his opportunity, becoming the first Roughrider quarterback to start all 18 games since Kent Austin, who last played for the club in 1993. Durant's consistency on the field {{was one of the reasons}} he earned the Roughriders' starting quarterback position, along with his ability to run for yards when his pass protection breaks down. Durant was named the Roughriders nominee for CFL Most Outstanding Player, and was selected a West Division All-Star at quarterback. He was also named the Roughriders' Wireless Age Most Popular Player. Durant led the Roughriders to the Grey Cup, where they were defeated by the Montreal Alouettes on a last second field goal. He finished the 2009 season with 4,348 passing yards and 501 rushing yards. Durant threw 24 touchdown passes during the season and also had 21 interceptions, leading the CFL. Heading into the 2010 season, Durant <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> down on his interceptions, although he tried to be optimistic, [...] "I throw 21 picks last year and I guarantee every guy with better stats than me wishes they were in the Grey Cup." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson faced {{numerous}} {{disagreements with}} the song's co-producer. It {{has been reported}} that Quincy Jones did not want the song to appear on Thriller and that he felt that the song was too weak {{to be part of the}} collection, but Jones has stated this is a false rumor. The producer disliked the demo and did not care for the song's bassline. Jones <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> Jackson's 29-second introduction. The entertainer, however, insisted that it be kept. [...] "I said, 'Michael we've got to cut that intro'" [...] Jones later recalled. [...] "He said: 'But that's the jelly! ... That's what makes me want to dance'. And when Michael Jackson tells you, 'That's what makes me want to dance', well, the rest of us just have to shut up." [...] Jones also wanted to change the track's title to [...] "Not My Lover", as he believed that people would think the song referred to the tennis player Billie Jean King. Jackson refused to change the title and asked Jones to give him co-producing credits for the track, as he felt that the finished product sounded close to the demo. In addition, Jackson wanted extra royalties. Jones granted him neither and the two fell out for several days.|$|E

500|$|The {{shooting}} script features {{a scene in}} Angela's car in which Ricky and Jane talk about death and beauty; the scene differed from earlier versions, which set it as a [...] "big scene on a freeway" [...] in which the three witness a car crash and see a dead body. The change was a practical decision, as the production was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs. The schedule called for two days to be spent filming the crash, but only half a day was available. Ball agreed, {{but only if the}} scene could retain a line of Ricky's where he reflects on having once seen a dead homeless woman: [...] "When you see something like that, it's like God is looking right at you, just for a second. And if you're careful, you can look right back." [...] Jane asks: [...] "And what do you see?" [...] Ricky: [...] "Beauty." [...] Ball said, [...] "They <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> that scene. They said it's not important. I said, 'You're out of your fucking mind. It's {{one of the most important}} scenes in the movie!' If any one line is the heart and soul of this movie, that is the line." [...] Another scene was rewritten to accommodate the loss of the freeway sequence; set in a schoolyard, it presents a [...] "turning point" [...] for Jane in that she chooses to walk home with Ricky instead of going with Angela. By the end of filming, the script had been through 10 drafts.|$|E

As of the 111th Congress, Frank is advocating a 25-percent reduction in the overall Military budget of the United States. [...] "The math is compelling: if we do not make reductions approximating 25 percent of the military budget starting fairly soon, it will be impossible to continue to fund an adequate level of domestic activity...," [...] wrote Frank. He claimed that such a significant reduction would have no effect on the United States' ability to defend itself. [...] "If," [...] he said, [...] "beginning one year from now, we were to cut military spending by 25 percent from its projected levels, we would still be immeasurably stronger than any combination of nations with whom we might be engaged." [...] Frank supports having fewer F-35 Joint Strike Fighter planes, but also supports a $3-billion backup engine project that the Pentagon does not want. [...] Frank told MSNBC's Keith Olbermann that he actually <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> the entire F-35 program, but as long as military spending continued, he would fight for his district's share of it.|$|E
