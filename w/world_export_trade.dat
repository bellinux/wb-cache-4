40|$|India {{is known}} for its {{livestock}} wealth and ranks high among the nations having bovine population. However, despite having huge livestock population, India stands insignificant in the world trade of livestock products. The recent concerted efforts made by the government in the era of liberalization after opening of the national economy to the international market have certainly boosted India’s export trade of livestock products to newer heights. The findings of this study show considerable increase in the export trade of India in meat and meat products and also in respect of milk and milk products, both in quantity and value terms. The export trade of India in milk and milk products got a real boost only after the early nineties period, i. e., in the era of liberalization. The estimates in this study also show an increasing trend in export trade of India in processed livestock products. The increase in livestock exports of India witnessed after the early nineties period is chiefly because of liberalization of trade and several trade policy changes coupled with surge in international prices of many livestock based products. The upswing in livestock exports of India in due course of time has also filtered into significant increase in her share not only in Asia but also in <b>world</b> <b>export</b> <b>trade.</b> But, {{the results of this study}} still indicate a marginal presence of India in world trade of majority of the livestock products. It is only in the case of bovine meat and also sheep and goat meat that India has shown a considerable share in the global trade of the same. The findings of this study also indicate that there will neither be any exportable surplus for milk nor meat and eggs in the near future. However, India still has enormous untapped potential in its livestock sector which if tapped in the desired manner and direction can lead us to emerge as the leading producer of milk and meat in the world in the years to come, but not in exports. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{share of}} {{emerging}} Asia in world trade has increased sharply {{over the past}} 25 years. A large part of this increase {{is the result of}} booming intraregional trade. This paper investigates the key factors behind the rapid increase in intraregional trade among economies in emerging Asia and its implications for the dependency of economies in the region on the business cycles in the EU, Japan, and the United States. The rise in intraregional trade is largely driven by rapidly growing intra-industry trade, which is a reflection of greater vertical specialization and the dispersion of production processes across borders. This has led to a sharp rise in trade in intermediate goods among economies in emerging Asia, but the EU, Japan, and the United States remain the main export markets for final goods.

Disaggregated {{analysis of goods}} and services export markets provides insights on aspects such as quality, market concentration, growth of destination markets, and geographical and sectoral diversification.

40|$|Despite the {{appreciation}} of the exchange rate, the eight Central and Eastern European countries (the CEE- 8) that entered the European Union in May 2004 have achieved a decade of impressive export growth, expanding significantly their shares of world markets. Does this mean that the real exchange rate is irrelevant? If not, what other factors compensated for {{the appreciation}} to explain the apparently strong competitiveness of these economies? And will these favorable factors continue to power export growth? This paper places in international context {{the achievements of the}} CEE- 8 and helps more broadly to identify the determinants of international competitiveness. Building from data at the six-digit level of disaggregation, it shows that the CEE- 8 made an impressive shift in product quality and in the technological intensity of exports, and that these shifts associated with the structural transformation were also associated with increased market share. The analysis strongly suggests that, when trading in international markets, countries benefit from higher product quality. However, while the structural transformation achieved was valuable in raising market shares, the easy gains from this process may be over.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a framework for understanding trade patterns in the Mashreq. An augmented gravity model is used to compare actual with expected levels of trade. Trade barriers, political uncertainty, and over-appreciation of domestic currencies seem to explain low levels of international trade. At the intra-regional level, specific trade barriers between Israel and other Mashreq countries reduce further levels of trade. Quite surprisingly, removing Israel from the sample leads to higher actual intra-regional trade than predicted. The analysis suggests that trade liberalization, correction of currency misalignments, reduction of political uncertainty, and improved trade relations with Israel would boost trade in the region.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the structural competitiveness of oil-rich economies in sub-Saharan Africa {{relative to other}} major oil-exporting developing countries, and investigates reasons for systematic differences in the non-oil export performance across these economies. The analysis reveals that oil-rich Africa lags behind other oil-exporters in terms of diversification, global market share and the overall investment climate. The poor performance of their nonoil sector can be largely attributed to weak infrastructure and institutional quality. The results also show that institutional quality is a significant determinant {{of the extent to}} which oil abundance affects the competitiveness of the non-oil sector; thereby explaining the divergent experiences of oil-rich economies across the world. This implies that oil wealth does not necessarily weaken the non-oil tradable sector; countries may mitigate the impact of Dutch disease and benefit from oil booms if revenues are used prudently to reduce oil dependence.

It shows that for many developing countries, actual preferential access is less generous than it appears because of low product coverage or complex rules of origin. Thus lowering tariffs under the multilateral system is {{likely to lead to}} a net increase in market access for many developing countries, with gains in market access offsetting losses from preference erosion. Furthermore, comparing various tariff-cutting proposals, the research shows that the largest gains in market access are generated by higher tariff cuts in agriculture.

40|$|This paper investigates how {{trade flows}} are being {{affected}} by new discriminatory measures implemented during {{the global financial}} crisis. We match data on behind-the-border measures (e. g., bailouts and subsidies) and border measures implemented through April 2010 to monthly HS 4 -digit bilateral trade data. Our estimation strategy relies on a first-differenced gravity equation and time-varying fixed effects to disentangle the impact of new discriminatory measures. Trade in exporter-importer pairs subject to new measures decreased by 5 to 8 percent relative to trade in the same product among pairs not subject to new measures. These product-level results imply global trade declines at the aggregate level of about 0. 2 percent, or $ 30 - 35 billion a year. These aggregate figures would be higher, if one third of measures had not been excluded due to incomplete data. The paper {{then goes on to}} dissect protectionism’s trade impact by disaggregating measures by type, advanced/developing countries, regions, sectors, and time. Behind-the-border measures are found to have been more harmful than border measures at the product level. Among border measures, impacts tend to be higher for less transparent measures. Advanced countries are found to be responsible for 2 / 3 of the trade decline due to crisis protectionism, but their exports also absorbed 2 / 3 of this decline. When breaking down measures in a time dimension, we find that those taken {{in the first nine months}} after the Lehman collapse were most harmful and likely continue to constitute a drag on trade.

Despite evidence of significant trade complementarities within WAEMU, implementation of the union''s current trade regime still suffers from persistent non-tariff barriers and administrative weaknesses. Based on an assessment of prospects for further trade integration, the paper also recommends strengthening the implementation of the present tariff union and supports the plan to extend it to all ECOWAS members. Finally, the paper stresses that an Economic Partnership Agreement with the EU could bring to the region the political momentum needed to address the weaknesses of the current trade regime, while also underlining the corresponding challenges in terms of trade diversion and tariff revenue losses.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} quantitative {{estimates of}} the impact of removing agricultural support (both tariffs and subsidies) in partial- and general-equilibrium frameworks. The results show that agricultural support in industrial countries is highly distortionary and tariffs have a larger distortionary impact than subsidies. Removal of agricultural support would likely raise the international prices of food, resulting in an increase in the cost of food for many net-food- importing countries, although the increase is generally small. The results also show that most of the benefits from removing agricultural support accrue to the countries that liberalize.

40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the role of}} export diversification in determining trade outcomes during the global financial crisis. The impact of export diversification (or concentration) is measured by assessing three different dimensions of specialization. First, concentration by geographic destination is considered; that is, whether the bulk of exports from a country go to many or few trading partners. Second, industry/sectoral concentration is considered; that is, whether a country’s exports are scattered across many industries and sectors, or concentrated in just a few. Third, product concentration is considered; that is, whether countries produce many products within their export sectors or just a few. The workhorse gravity trade model is adapted with trade diversification as an additional trade cost, and the model solution is empirically tested on a dataset containing over 500 thousand observations for Latin America. Industry and product concentration are found to significantly affect the resilience of Latin American countries’ trade during the global financial crisis - increasing the diversity of both export sectors and export products within sectors by one standard deviation reduces the quarterly decline in exports by approximately 4. 7 percent. Diversifying exports across many different trading partners is not found to significantly affect outcomes.

Chinese customs data are used to construct, for the first time, quarterly unit value and volume series that are then used to estimate foreign trade income and price elasticities. The estimated export supply price elasticities are negative and became even more negative after the reforms in 1985. The import price elasticity {{is very close to}} minus one. These results suggest that administrative controls still have a dominant effect on China’s trade and may also suggest that reforms in the management system of Chinese enterprises were not sufficient to create profit maximizing behavior by managers.

This study identifies middle-income developing countries that are vulnerable to export revenue loss from preference erosion.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the question: Who bears the larger {{portion of the}} excess burden of a tariff-the country that imposes it, or a country that it trades with? For a country that can influence its terms of trade, {{there are two ways}} of approaching this question. This paper shows that under certain assumptions, the extra burden from a marginal change in the homecountry tariff is shared equally between the home and foreign country at a tariff rate equal to twice the optimal tariff for the home country. Also, the cumulative welfare effect of a tariff in the home country, relative to free trade, turns out to be equalized across countries when the home tariff equals four times its optimal tariff. The paper provides an application of these results and points policymakers to the types of data that are relevant if they want to negotiate over "burden sharing.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} effect of {{constrained}} trade finance on trade flows in countries undergoing financial and balance of payments crises. Most of the countries that had a major crisis had a significant trade contraction, while trade-related finance declined sharply. However, trade may also be affected by other variables such as world demand, domestic demand, banking crises, changes in export and import prices, and real exchange rate depreciation. To estimate {{the effect of}} constrained trade finance on trade flows, we estimate import and export volume equations including explicitly trade financing as an explanatory variable {{in addition to the}} usual variables such as relative prices and income. We conclude that constrained trade finance is a factor in explaining both export and import volumes in the short-run. A fall in external trade finance explains a relatively small part of the trade loss during crises, while a fall in trade financing in connection with domestic banking crisis can lead to a substantial loss of trade.
