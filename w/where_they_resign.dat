50|$|Twins Affair {{recorded}} {{their first}} album in 1999 tagged “Egunje has sploit everything”. The album which {{was produced by}} music Producer/Musicologist, Mr. Austin Emielu now Dr. Austin Emielu, Senior Lecturer at the University of Ilorin, Nigeria became an instant hit. The success of the maiden album spurred the Twins Affair {{to go to the}} studio a year later in 2000 to record another album tagged “Why fighting, why killing” in response to the religious conflicts in the then Northern Nigeria. The two albums released by the Twins Affair did not accord the group national recognition as its popularity was only confined to about six states in the North out of the 36 states in Nigeria. The frustration of the inability of the group to penetrate Lagos, which is the nerve centre of music/entertainment in Nigeria, compelled her to go on sabbatical. In their second year in the University (2008), the Twins Affair came out with an Album tagged ‘AREA’. The album however flopped due to poor publicity and the unserious attitude of the marketer. This was followed some months later by the release of an audio and video single tagged 'SKELEBE'. Although the video was aired on local and international television stations, Twins Affair was still not given proper recognition it deserved in the Nigeria music industry. In 2010, the Twins Affair released an audio and video single tagged ‘ASA’. The single became an instant hit. This was followed by another hit single and video in 2011 tagged ‘O bad gan’. With these two singles, the Twins Affair became a household name in the Nigerian music scene. The Twins Affair has also featured and produced many top Nigerian artistes such as LKT, Yung6ix, Slay, Aq, Maytronomy, Nene Johnson, Ms Chief, Nenjazi a Nigerian American-based artiste just to mention a few. In the area of music education, Twins Affair taught at the prestigious PEFTI Film Institute Lagos, Nigeria owned by the doyen of Nigerian entertainment industry, Wale Adenuga Production (Super Story) from 2012 until 2013 <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>resigned</b> their appointments as Music Lecturers/Studio Music producers to enable them proceed to International Institute of Journalism, Abuja for a one-year Post -Graduate Diploma in Journalism. The Twins Affair is {{a force to be reckoned}} with in Nigeria either as Music Producers or a Recording Artistes. Their recent works such as BEAUTIFUL ft. M kel, GO THERE, and MELODY ft MS. Chief and Nenjazi attest to this fact.|$|R

5000|$|Most of Kirino’s novels center upon {{women and}} crime. Typically, in her novels, such as Out, Kirino mainly focuses on {{women who do}} unimaginable things, which is why her books can be {{considered}} as “feminist noir.” [...] She writes in a convincing, realistic type of way, which leads to the greatness of her work stemming from [...] "her ability to put us inside the skins of these women.” [...] This focus on more realistic portrayals of Japanese women seems to be a trademark of her work, found in many of her novels such as Grotesque. [...] She is also committed to giving women recognition in Japanese literature, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> are often <b>resigned</b> to sexual and domestic roles. The author recounts how a young man once told her that until he read Out, he “never realized that regular middle aged women actually had a life.” Society, she says, takes advantage of powerless women and it is her goal to create empowered female characters to show readers the power of the “weaker sex.” [...] For these reasons, she has been called the [...] "queen of Japanese crime." [...] In fact, the plot of Out {{has been described as a}} framework for her critique of [...] "the problems of ordinary women in contemporary Japanese society." ...|$|R
