50|$|Hydronics {{is the use}} of {{a liquid}} heat-transfer medium in heating and cooling systems. The working fluid is {{typically}} <b>water,</b> <b>glycol,</b> or mineral oil. Some of the oldest and most common examples are steam and hot-water radiators. Historically, in large-scale commercial buildings such as high-rise and campus facilities, a hydronic system may include both a chilled and a heated water loop, to provide for both heating and air conditioning. Chillers and cooling towers are used either separately or together as means to provide water cooling, while boilers heat water. A recent innovation is the chiller boiler system, which provides an efficient form of HVAC for homes and smaller commercial spaces.|$|E
50|$|In a {{standard}} fluid-based system, a working fluid, typically <b>water,</b> <b>glycol</b> or mineral oil is then piped through these pipes or plate chillers. The {{heat from the}} PV cells is conducted through the metal and absorbed by the working fluid (presuming that the working fluid is cooler than the operating temperature of the cells). In closed-loop systems this heat is either exhausted (to cool it), or transferred at a heat exchanger, where it flows to its application. In open-loop systems, this heat is used, or exhausted before the fluid returns to the PV cells. It is also possible to disperse nanoparticles in the liquid to create a liquid filter for PV/T applications. The basic advantage {{of this type of}} split configuration is that the thermal collector and the photovoltaic collector can operate at different temperatures.|$|E
5000|$|Waste heat {{recovery}} {{is a process}} that captures excess heat that would normally be discharged at manufacturing facilities and converts it into electricity and steam, or returns energy to the manufacturing process in the form of heated air, <b>water,</b> <b>glycol,</b> or oil. A [...] "waste {{heat recovery}} boiler" [...] contains a series of water-filled tubes placed throughout the area where heat is released. When high-temperature heat meets the boiler, steam is produced, which in turn powers a turbine that creates electricity. This process {{is similar to that of}} other fired boilers, but in this case, waste heat replaces a traditional flame. No fossil fuels are used in this process. Metals, glass, pulp and paper, silicon and other production plants are typical locations where waste heat recovery can be effective.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Control devices {{can be used}} {{in civil}} {{structures}} to dissipate energy from earthquakes, reduce structural damage and prevent failure. Semi-active control devices {{have been shown to be}} more energy-efficient than active devices and more effective in reducing seismic structural vibrations than passive devices. A type of semi-active control device, the magnetorheological (MR) damper, consists of a hydraulic cylinder containing micron-sized, magnetically polarizable particles suspended in a liquid such as <b>water,</b> <b>glycol,</b> min-eral or synthetic oil.
