25|$|Stieglitz was a perfectionist, and {{it showed}} {{in every aspect of}} Camera Work. He {{advanced}} the art of photogravure printing by demanding unprecedentedly high standards for the prints in Camera Work. The visual quality of the gravures was so high that when a set of prints failed to arrive for a Photo-Secession exhibition in Brussels, a selection of gravures from the magazine was hung instead. Most viewers assumed they <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> original photographs.|$|E
25|$|Stieglitz, {{always a}} perfectionist, {{personally}} tipped {{in each of}} the photogravures in every issue, touching up dust spots or scratches when necessary. This time-consuming and exhausting work assured only the highest standards in every copy but sometimes delayed the mailing of the issues since Stieglitz would not allow anyone else to do it.

25|$|In {{the early}} years, {{they were more}} {{interested}} in the acoustics of speech. For instance, they <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> differences between /ba/ or /da/, but now research has been directed to the response in the brain from the stimuli. In recent years, there has been a model developed {{to create a sense of}} how speech perception works; this model is known as the Dual Stream Model. This model has drastically changed from how psychologists look at perception. The first section of the Dual Stream Model is the ventral pathway. This pathway incorporates middle temporal gyrus, inferior temporal sulcus and perhaps the inferior temporal gyrus. The ventral pathway shows phonological representations to the lexical or conceptual representations, which is the meaning of the words. The second section of the Dual Stream Model is the dorsal pathway. This pathway includes the sylvian parietotemporal, inferior frontal gyrus, anterior insula, and premotor cortex. Its primary function is to take the sensory or phonological stimuli and transfer it into an articulatory-motor representation (formation of speech).|$|E

40|$|In {{this lesson}} {{students}} will build on knowledge gained in the Hurricane Research lesson and the Hurricane Frequency and Intensity Lesson. Specifically, they {{will discuss the}} interaction (pathway) between a specific 'sphere' and the 'event' (hurricane). Working in groups, students will be assigned a specific sphere to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> more closely in relation to hurricanes. When all groups are finished, each will present their findings to the class for comparison and a closer look. If the group is assigned the Hydrosphere they will <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> oceans in the Live Access Server (LAS), if the group is assigned the Lithosphere <b>the</b> group will <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Land Surface in the LAS, if the group is assigned the Biosphere they will <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Biosphere in the LAS and the group that is assigned <b>the</b> Atmosphere will <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Atmosphere in the LAS.

500|$|On January 17, 2015, Fox {{confirmed}} that they <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> possibility of bringing The X-Files back, {{not as a}} movie, but as a limited run television season. Fox chairman Dana Walden told reporters that [...] "conversations so far have only been logistical and are in very early stages" [...] and that the series would only go forward if Carter, Anderson, and Duchovny were all on board, {{and that it was}} a matter of ensuring all of their timetables are open. On March 24, 2015, it was confirmed the series would return with series creator Chris Carter and lead actors David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson. It premiered on January 24, 2016.|$|E
500|$|Other {{significant}} obstacles for {{law enforcement}} were Bundy's generic, essentially anonymous physical features, and a curious chameleon-like ability to change his appearance almost at will. Early on, police complained of the futility of showing his photograph to witnesses; he looked different in virtually every photo ever taken of him. In person, [...] "his expression would so change his whole appearance that there were moments that you weren't even sure you <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same person", said Stewart Hanson, Jr., {{the judge in the}} DaRonch trial. [...] "He [...] really a changeling." [...] Bundy was well aware of this unusual quality and he exploited it, using subtle modifications of facial hair or hairstyle to significantly alter his appearance as necessary. He concealed his one distinctive identifying mark, a dark mole on his neck, with turtleneck shirts and sweaters. Even his Volkswagen Beetle proved difficult to pin down; its color was variously described by witnesses as metallic or non-metallic, tan or bronze, light brown or dark brown.|$|E
500|$|The {{navigation}} {{turns to}} the west, passing under the railway line, and then loops back {{to return to the}} eastern side of the railway. It runs along the northern edge of some railway sidings which form part of Eastleigh Works, to reach Withymead Lock. This was unusual, as it included a bypass channel to take excess water around the lock, whereas the other locks used vents in the gates. Just below the lock, the navigation rejoins the river channel. At Barton Bay, the Barton River leaves the navigation, following a course to the west of the channel. A horse bridge carried the towpath over the river, which used to supply water to Barton Peveril Mill. The next cut began a little further south, with Bishopstoke or Stoke Lock at the head of it. There are four bridges on Bishopstoke Road, as it crosses the Barton River, the navigation, the river channel and the tailrace of Shears Mill, Bishopstoke. The mill was a large four-storey building, which was demolished in the 1920s. Four years before demolition, two water turbines of [...] and [...] diameter were installed, and were retained after the demise of the mill, in the hope that they could be used to generate DC power for the village. Several community groups <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> possibility of restoring the water turbines to generate electricity.|$|E

[...] The force of fire was strong and fearful; the prefectural office was on the other side of Matsue O-hashi bridge, but a housewife stated she had felt that the fire would come to the other side of the bridge.|$|E

After we had {{been in and out}} of several shops, we saw two different elegant-looking wool materials in Fat Yanko’s store at Bahçekapısı (between Eminönü and Sirkeci in Istanbul, now called Bahçekapı). One of them was quite dark red, resembling the cherry colour, and the other a rich yellow with a touch of orange. When the sales clerk made the two fabrics fly together with a twist of his hand they became so bright that it reminded us of the beauty of a goldfinch. We thought we <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> colours flickering in burning fire.

2500|$|On 13 January 2005, history {{professor}} Lee Tae-jin (이태진, 李泰鎭) of Seoul National University unveiled an illustration {{from an old}} Japanese magazine he had found at an antique bookstore in Tokyo. The 84th edition of the Japanese magazine Fūzokugahō (風俗畫報) published on 25 January 1895 has a Japanese illustration of Gojong and the then-Queen Consort receiving Inoue Kaoru, the Japanese chargé d'affaires. The illustration is marked 24 December 1894 and signed by the artist Ishizuka (石塚 [...] ) with a legend [...] "The [...] King and Queen, moved by our honest advice, realize the need for resolute reform for the first time." [...] Lee said that the depiction of the clothes and background are very detailed and suggests that it was drawn at the scene as it happened. Both the King and Inoue <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> then-Queen Consort as though the conversation were taking place between the Queen and Inoue with the King listening.|$|E

2500|$|It was Serling's {{decision}} {{to sell his}} share of the series back to the network that eventually allowed for a Twilight Zone revival. As an in-house production, CBS stood to earn more money producing The Twilight Zone than it could by purchasing a new series produced by an outside company. Even so, the network was slow to consider a revival, shooting down offers from the original production team of Rod Serling and Buck Houghton and later from American filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. Their hesitation stemmed from concerns familiar to the original series: The Twilight Zone had never been the breakaway hit CBS wanted, so they should not expect it to do better in a second run. [...] "We <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> success of the original series in syndication and the enormous popularity of the Steven Spielberg films," [...] said CBS program chief Harvey Shepard. [...] "Many of them (such as E.T. or Poltergeist) deal with elements of the show. Perhaps the public is ready for it again." ...|$|E
