He has been praised for having a good passing range. This aspect of his game has shown improvement since the 2005–06 season, when he began to favour simpler passes over more ambitious ones, and his relatively high pass completion rate can be attributed to this change. Barton's passes have often proved to be crucial; in the past he has led the way in his team's assists.|$|E

5|$|After the Gadsden Purchase, {{southern}} Arizona's social elite, {{including the}} Estevan Ochoa, Mariano Samaniego, and Leopoldo Carillo families, remained primarily Mexican American until {{the coming of}} the railroad in the 1880s. When the Sonora Exploring and Mining Company opened silver mines in southern Arizona, it sought to employ educated, middle-class Americans who shared a <b>work</b> <b>ethic</b> <b>and</b> leadership abilities to operate the mines. A biographical analysis of some 200 of its employees, classed as capitalists, managers, laborers, and general service personnel, reveals that the resulting work force included Europeans, Americans, Mexicans, and Indians.

40|$|Orientation: As {{a result}} of the {{proliferation}} of unethical behaviour in the workplace, the study of <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> has received new impetus. Research purpose: The research study sought to determine the relationship between <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>and</b> <b>work</b> values, with the objective of determining whether <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> statistically significantly predict work values. Motivation for the study: As <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> (i. e. behavioural intent) are a determinant of work values (i. e. overt behaviour), researchers are investigating their potential in preventing unethical behaviour. Research design, approach and method: A descriptive quantitative research design was employed in the study. A survey was conducted using the Multidimensional <b>Work</b> <b>Ethic</b> Profile <b>and</b> the Values Scale, which in previous studies have produced acceptable Cronbach’s alpha coefficients. Data were collected from 301 respondents in one geographical area in South Africa. Main findings: Work values {{did not appear to be}} highly esteemed by respondents, as only 6 of the 22 dimensions had a positive score. However, all seven dimensions of <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> had positive scores. A negative correlation was found between <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>and</b> <b>work</b> values. In addition, <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> predicted 9 % of the variance in work values, providing sufficient evidence to accept the postulated research hypothesis. Practical implications: The findings of the study could be used by human resource managers to promote ethical behaviour, by focusing not only on <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> but also on the relationship between <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>and</b> <b>work</b> values. Contribution: The study provides evidence of a relationship between <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>and</b> <b>work</b> behaviours, such as work values, within the South African context, and it thus addresses a research gap in this area. </p...|$|R

5|$|Prior to {{the outset}} of the 2011 season, head coach Rex Ryan named Sanchez a team captain. The Jets opened the season with a 2–3 record leading to discontent within the clubhouse. The team had begun to stray from their {{philosophy}} of consistently running the ball and began to pass more often; however, the offense struggled with this adjustment. Wide receivers Plaxico Burress, Santonio Holmes, and Derrick Mason approached coach Ryan to question offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer's system as Holmes and Mason averaged only three catches per game and Burress only 2.5 catches through four games. Additionally, Sanchez drew criticism for his difficulties to effectively throw the ball to his receivers. The struggles culminated with Holmes getting into a heated argument with another teammate in the huddle during their final regular season game against the Miami Dolphins. Holmes was benched in the fourth quarter while Sanchez threw three interceptions in the Jets' loss that eliminated the team from playoff contention {{for the first time in}} Sanchez's career. Statistically, Sanchez had similar numbers in a comparison to Eli Manning when he concluded his third year of football however, there were concerns that Sanchez was simply an ineffective quarterback and therefore expendable. During the offseason, Sanchez was criticized by anonymous teammates for his poor <b>work</b> <b>ethic</b> <b>and</b> his inability to improve; these claims were publicly refuted by other teammates. Despite questions surrounding his job security, after New York acquired Tim Tebow, the Jets agreed to a 3-year contract extension with Sanchez on March 9, 2012.

The relationships between <b>work</b> <b>ethics,</b> motivations <b>and</b> innovative attitude with the farmers income was analyzed using the chi-square, they are {{found to have a}} significant correlation, and then continued by Phi test. The results showed that buffalo farmers in Lembor Subdistrict, West Manggarai regency, had a high working <b>ethics,</b> farming motivations <b>and</b> a positive innovative attitude. The <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>and</b> innovative attitudes were not related to the income of buffalo farmers. The Breeding motivations had significantly correlated to income of buffalo breeder’s (X 2 count 14. 934 > 3. 84 X 2 table), meaning that the higher breeding motivations, would bring effect to a higher income. The relationship between the variable of breeding motivations and the breeder’s income shows a medium (Phi coefficient = 0. 381).

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to find out the {{relationship}} between role stres, reward, <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>and</b> job satisfaction among civil servants. A total of 700 respondents out of of 1214 civil servants from Kedah, Perlis, and Pulau Pinang were involved in this study. The construct of the concepts and measurements were adapted from past studies. The concept of role stres was measured using an instrument by Rizzo et. a 1 (1970), that consists of role conflict and role ambiguity dimensions. The reward concept was measured using Work Preference Inventory (WPI) by Amabile et. a 1 (1994) which consists of intrinsic and extrinsic reward dimensions. Meanwhile, <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> was measured using Islamic <b>Work</b> <b>Ethics</b> (IWE), created by Ali (1992). Work satisfaction was measured using an instrument adapted from Wright & Cropanzano (1998). Multiple regression analysis was used to study the relationship between role stres, reward, <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>and</b> job satisfaction. The result of this study shows that role stres has negative and significant relationship with job satisfaction. Similar result was found for <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> as the study found that it has a significant and positive relationship with job satisfaction. Based on the findings, it is recommended that the management take the right step to create a job description that can be understood clearly by civil servants so that they can accept and perform their job with a high degree of satisfaction.

40|$|Orientation: The {{mechanism}} {{facilitating the}} development of organisational commitment and performance of citizenship behaviours is of research interest to scholars. Recent research trends suggest that job satisfaction can mediate {{the development of}} employee commitment and citizenship behaviours. Research purpose: The present study hypothesised that job satisfaction mediated {{the relationships between the}} predictors (perceived organisational support <b>and</b> protestant <b>work</b> <b>ethics)</b> <b>and</b> outcomes (organisational citizenship behaviours and organisational commitment). Motivation for the study: There is paucity of literature on the mediating influence of job satisfaction on predictors-outcomes linkages amongst agriculture workers in Nigeria. Available studies either examined the main effect of perceived organisational support on citizenship behaviours or the mediating influence of satisfaction on citizenship behaviours and not the proposed model. Research design, approach and method: The present study was survey-correlational in design. Data were obtained from 223 heterogeneous samples from different organisations (such as ministry of agriculture, parastatals, banks, private agro-allied companies, and insurance companies). Main findings: Results showed that job satisfaction fully mediated the relationship between perceived organisational support and citizenship behaviours and partially mediated the relationship between perceived organisational support and organisational commitment. Further, employee satisfaction partially mediated the relationships between protestant <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>and</b> citizenship behaviours and organisational commitment. Practical/managerial implications: This study indicated that both protestant <b>work</b> <b>ethics</b> <b>and</b> perceived organisational support are important in motivating employees to engage in cooperative behaviours and exhibit greater commitment through job satisfaction.
