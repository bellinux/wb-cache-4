40|$|Fiber {{reinforcement}} {{has emerged}} {{as an alternative to}} steel bars in precast concrete segments due to advantages such as saving cost and reducing production time while developing a more robust product with improved handling and long-term durability. ACI recently drafted a new report as the first design guideline on FRC tunnel segments to provide specific guidance for this emerging technology. This document offers general information on the history of FRC precast segments from tunneling projects throughout the world; a procedure for structural analysis and design based on governing load cases, and a description of the material parameters, tests and analyses required to complete the design. This paper summarizes the design considerations in this ACI guideline prepared by the authors of this paper as the main contributors. Application of this guideline to design of a mid-size tunnel results in elimination of steel bars and reduction of crack <b>width</b> <b>under</b> service <b>loads...</b>|$|R
30|$|This study {{therefore}} aims {{to propose}} a reformed kind of UHPC which can exhibit high tensile ductility and controlled crack width simultaneously. For this purpose, fiber hybridization of steel fiber with a synthetic fiber is considered to improve ductility, and plastic beads are added into the material to control crack <b>width</b> <b>under</b> tensile <b>loading.</b> As mentioned earlier, partial replacement of steel fibers with high strength PE fibers can produce more ductile tensile behavior but cause enlarged crack width. Plastic beads were adopted to overcome this problem. The basic idea {{of this approach is}} as follows. Hydrophobic plastic beads incorporated in the UHPC acts as an artificial flaw because of imperfect bonding with the surrounding matrix, reducing first cracking strength and facilitating crack formation around the plastic beads (Wang and Li 2004). Well-dispersed plastic beads make it easy to induce multiple cracking, which can consequently reduce crack width. In this study, the mechanical performance and crack patterns of the proposed UHPC were investigated.|$|R
40|$|Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) {{reinforcing}} bars have attracted considerable attention for applications where corrosion of steel reinforcement is problematic. Due to the generally low elastic modulus and poor bond characteristics of FRP {{as compared to}} steel {{reinforcing bars}}, the use of FRP results in larger crack <b>widths</b> <b>under</b> service <b>loads.</b> Fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) is proposed for use with FRP to reduce crack widths. The work presented herein includes the results from 16 beams tested under four-point bending with either Grade 420 (Grade 60) steel or FRP reinforcing bars, and either plain concrete or FRC. A modified Gergely-Lutz model {{was applied to the}} measured crack widths to calculate bond coefficients that were used to quantify the effectiveness of FRC in reducing crack widths. In the beams with steel reinforcing bars, the FRC was found to have little influence on crack widths. In the beams with FRP reinforcing bars, the FRC was found to significantly reduce maximum crack widths...|$|R

Both seismic loads and gravity loads have effect on top beam flange fractures. The objective was to quantify the variation of stress intensity factor to weld root flaw sizes {{on top of the}} beam flange at column face in steel frame connections <b>under</b> gravity <b>loads.</b> Finite-element analyses were used to study fracture toughness in welded beam-column connections. Investigations of fracture behavior mainly focused on the standard pre-Northridge connection geometry. Finite element analysis was performed using the ANSYS computer program. Stress intensity factor was calculated through a J-integral approach. The parametric study was conducted to quantify elastic fracture demands as a function of beam geometries. Results show that the distributions of stress intensity factor tend to be even across the flange <b>width</b> <b>under</b> gravity <b>loads.</b> The thickness of beam web has little effect on stress intensity factors. Stress intensity factor increases nearly linear with the increase of flaw size, and it increases with the increase of depth of beam and width of beam. Stress intensity factor reduces with the increase of thickness of beam flange...|$|R
40|$|As {{to the use}} of {{high-strength}} steel in composite steel and reinforced concrete (SRC), structures, it remains to be clarified whether the ductile behavior can be ensured, especially when the {{high-strength steel}} is used in combination with normal-strength concrete. This paper describes the test results on the elasto-plastic behavior of SRC beams using high-strength steel, and discusses the maximum strength and the deformation capacity, with the investigation on the applicability of the concept of superposed strength. Test and analysis revealed that the behavior of SRC beams with high-strength steel was stable and of the ideal elastic-perfectly plastic type; the maximum strength of SRC beams was well predicted by the ultimate strength theory; the deformation capacity was sufficiently large; and the crack <b>width</b> <b>under</b> the short-term <b>loading</b> was within the limit...|$|R

To the sample with single joint, its strength, elastic modulus and failure mode {{are controlled by}} joint dip angle to much extent, and it will shear and slip along or split across joint face to fail, in which sample’s strength and elastic modulus is minimum corresponding to the first failure mode. To the jointed sample with different joint continuity degree, its strength and elastic modulus decrease with joint continuity degree, and effect on sample’s strength is much more serious. With increase of joint set, sample’s strength and elastic modulus gradually decrease. With increase of joint width, strength and elastic modulus decreases, and effect on sample’s strength is much more serious...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{stress and}} strain {{calculations}} at a notch usually require a non-linear finite element analysis when local yielding has occurred. The strain energy density hypothesis is a method to predict these {{stress and strain}} values. This method proposes that the plastic strain energy density {{is equivalent to the}} strain energy density found assuming the material to be entirely elastic. This hypothesis was evaluated using the finite element method, which was tested by comparing to exact solutions of elastic and elasto-plastic problems, to calculate the stress and strain field for two notched plates of varying <b>widths</b> <b>under</b> elasto-plastic <b>loading.</b> For both geometries, a plane stress and plane strain analysis was performed. The elasto-plastic strain energy density from the finite element method was found to be greater than that predicted by this proposal, which in turn resulted in under-predicting the local stresses and strains. This difference was greater for the plane stress condition than for the plane strain condition. Comparisons were also made with notch stresses based the Neuber method. The two methods appear to give an upper and lower bound to the actual stresses and strains. By combining the results of the strain energy density method and the Neuber method, reasonably accurate estimates of stress and strain values can be obtained. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|The {{useful life}} of a buried concrete, {{containment}} structure for low level nuclear wii. ste may be controlled {{by the loss of}} its load-bearing capacity or an increase in permeability. The latter factor is controlled by the general degradation of the concrete and by the presence of discrete cracks resuking from extermdl y applied loads or from restraint to normal volume changes. To be able to predict the effects of cracks on permeability, it is necessary to understand the causes and mechanisms of discrete crack formation in reinforced concrete structures. The objective of this report is to provide an overview of the design and behavior of reinforced concrete members and to discuss the factors affecting the formation of cracks in hardened concrete. The underlying philosophy of modern reinforced concrete design is presented, and it is shown that it allows for the formation of cracks of controlled <b>widths</b> <b>under</b> service <b>loads.</b> Models for predicting the width of flexural cracks are reviewed. Factors affecting drying shrinkage cracks and approximate methods for considering them are discussed. An example is provided to illustrate how to determine whether drying shrinkage cracks will develop under specific conditions. This is followed by a discussion of techniques to predict the number and widths of drying shrinkage cracks. Finally, there is a discussion of the interaction between flexural and drying shrinkage cracking.

Cold-rolled {{deformed}} bar with wing {{is a new}} type of cold-rolled {{deformed bar}}, it has high tensile strength and better ductility than the general cold-rolled deformed bars, and has good bonding properties with concrete. Five types of totally 15 full-scale specimens were tested to investigate the mechanical behavior, failure mode and the suitable value of minimum reinforcement ratio of concrete slab with cold-rolled deformed bar with wing. Experimental parameters include the reinforcement ratio, concrete strength, and reinforcement diameter. The deflection of mid-span, the strain of cold-rolled deformed bar and the crack <b>width</b> measured <b>under</b> each <b>load</b> level were studied. The test shows that the specimens with the reinforcement ratio of 0. 15 % present ductile failure, while those with the reinforcement ratio of 0. 12 % present brittle failure.

40|$|An {{influential}} {{conception of}} visual working memory is {{of a small}} number of discrete memory "slots", each storing an integrated representation of a single visual object, including all its component features. When a scene contains more objects than there are slots, visual attention controls which objects gain access to memory. A key prediction of such a model is that the absolute error in recalling multiple features of the same object will be correlated, because features belonging to an attended object are all stored, bound together. Here, we tested participants' ability to reproduce from memory both the color and orientation of an object indicated by a location cue. We observed strong independence of errors between feature dimensions even for large memory arrays (6 items), inconsistent with an upper limit on the number of objects held in memory. Examining the pattern of responses in each dimension revealed a gaussian distribution of error centered on the target value that increased in <b>width</b> <b>under</b> higher memory <b>loads.</b> For large arrays, a subset of responses were not centered on the target but instead predominantly corresponded to mistakenly reproducing one of the other features held in memory. These misreporting responses again occurred independently in each feature dimension, consistent with 'misbinding' due to errors in maintaining the binding information that assigns features to objects. The results support a shared-resource model of working memory, in which increasing memory load incrementally degrades storage of visual information, reducing the fidelity with which both object features and feature bindings are maintained...|$|R
