5|$|Many fans of {{the show}} were outraged when Mercedes was {{supposedly}} murdered by Freddie Roscoe in November 2014, just a week after her sister Carmel died in a train crash. However, Jennifer Metcalfe stated that: 'Mercedes's departure is totally shrouded in mystery. Running up to the week where she exits, she has really annoyed pretty much everyone in the village, so it's 'who's done it?'. The story line was billed as a complete mystery, as the viewers don't completely know what happened between Mercedes and her killer on {{the night at the}} McQueen house, or <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> was actually dead.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} based on actual reports of {{conflict}} between the two nations. Hermione Norris made her final appearance as Ros Myers; the producers intended to leave her fate open {{in order for the}} audience to debate <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> survived the hotel explosion {{at the end of the}} episode. It was viewed by under six million viewers after its original broadcast, and received overwhelmingly positive reviews, particularly due to the reveal of Nightingale's plot and the cliffhanger, questioning whether or not Ros survived the hotel explosion.|$|E
5|$|The series {{opens with}} Jerry Seinfeld (Jerry Seinfeld) and George Costanza (Jason Alexander) seated at Pete's Luncheonette, debating the {{placement}} of one of George's shirt buttons. Jerry tells George about a woman he met in Lansing, Michigan, Laura (Pamela Brull), who is coming to New York, and the two discuss <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> has romantic intentions. The next evening, Jerry tells his neighbor Kessler (Michael Richards) that he thinks he misunderstood the situation with Laura. However, he then receives {{a telephone call from}} Laura, who asks if she can stay overnight at his apartment. Though Jerry agrees, he is still unsure whether or not her visit is intended to be romantic. George and Jerry continue to debate the issue, with Jerry determined to find the true nature of her visit.|$|E
5000|$|Episode 2: [...] "Where's Nicole?"Bridget is {{frustrated}} when Nicole {{does not show}} up for work. Nicole tells her friends that she couldn't {{get out of bed}} to go to work and contemplates <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she's</b> subconsciously ruining this opportunity for herself. Tina and Janjay clash at a meeting. Rachel and Andrew pitch story ideas at a meeting and must compete for a spot in the September issue. Sparks fly when Bridget and Andrew go to a party for charity.|$|R

60|$|But {{she knew}} the morrow was coming, <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> and <b>she</b> cowered down on his breast. She was wild with fear of the parting and the {{subsequent}} days. They must drink, after tomorrow, separate cups. She was filled with vague terror {{of what it would}} be. The sense of the oneness and unity of their fates was gone.|$|R
5|$|Heureuse Réunion {{responded to}} the cannonade in kind. During the engagement, Gaspard {{repeatedly}} attempted to board Southampton, where his vastly superior numbers could overwhelm the British crew. Yeo was aware of his enemy's intentions, and repeatedly manoeuvered out of the way, his more disciplined and agile vessel easily able to remain out of contact with the overloaded Haitian ship. Within half an hour the highly efficient gunners on Southampton had knocked down the main and mizen masts on Heureuse Réunion, leaving her unable to manoeuvre and vulnerable to repeated pounding at close range. Despite the severe damage the Haitian ship suffered, her crew continued to fire cannon at irregular intervals for 45 minutes, each shot prompting a broadside from the British ship. The two smaller Haitian vessels {{did not support the}} frigate, fleeing towards Maraguana near Petit Goâve to shelter under the batteries there. By 07:45, after over an hour of heavy fire, Yeo hailed Heureuse Réunion to discover <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> had surrendered. Somebody aboard replied that they had, although Gaspard had been seriously wounded and was no longer in command, so the identity of the person who gave the surrender is not known.|$|E
5|$|Keith {{questions}} Veronica about <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> {{broke into}} the house, despite knowing her guilt. Jake and a county prosecutor tell Keith that they will get a judge's order and will return to prosecute Veronica. The supercomputer processes {{the names of all}} the Castle members just as Keith hands over the surveillance tape to the county prosecutor. Logan tries to apologize to Veronica. One of the Castle members comes up and tells her that the organization videotaped her, and Logan assaults him. Veronica returns the tape to Jake Kane on the condition that he does not tell Keith about it. She sees in the newspaper that charges have been filed against Keith for tampering with evidence relating to Veronica's break-in, likely meaning that he will lose the votes needed to win the sheriff's election. She goes into a voting booth and votes for Keith as sheriff, walking away in pouring rain.|$|E
5|$|Torres, {{who was in}} a coma {{the entire}} time, is resuscitated by Paris and the Doctor; she had almost died from the {{accident}} in the ion storm. Chakotay believes that Torres' encounter with her mother was a hallucination prompted from her near-death experience, but she believes that it was real. Torres believes that her mother is being punished because of her daughter's dishonor, stating that she must return to the Barge of the Dead to rescue her. Captain Kathryn Janeway permits Torres to put herself in an induced coma, with the Doctor monitoring the procedure. After being placed in a coma, Torres successfully returns to the barge. She reunites with her mother, but they argue about <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> has truly embraced Klingon spirituality. Miral responds by telling her that she does not understand what it truly means to be a Klingon. After their conversation, Torres decides to take her mother's place on the barge; even though Miral resists the transference, she is allowed to move on Sto-vo-kor (a version of the afterlife similar to the Norse Valhalla) while Torres is escorted into Gre'thor. She discovers that Voyager is her version of Gre'thor, and is confronted by alternate versions of the crew. Miral returns to explain that she cannot fully be released into Sto-vo-kor until Torres completes her journey. Tuvok attacks Torres again with a bat'leth, but she surrenders rather than fighting back. Miral identifies this as the first step in her path. She informs Torres that they will reunite either in Sto-vo-kor or when Torres returns home. Torres is resuscitated and embraced by Janeway.|$|E
6000|$|Poor Fergus {{felt the}} {{accusation}} of cackling unjust, {{since he had}} only told Wilfred in confidence, and that had been betrayed, but he had got his lesson on family honour, and he subsided into his wonted look-out for curious stones, while Gillian was overtaken by Jasper--- <b>whether</b> willingly <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> <b>she</b> hardly knew---but his first word was, 'Little beast!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I say she shall," [...] replied Marais; [...] "and that <b>whether</b> <b>she</b> does <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> <b>she</b> shall {{accompany}} {{me and not}} stay here to be the wife of an English boy." ...|$|R

25|$|Within a {{month after}} Genie's {{admission}} to Children's Hospital, Jay Shurley, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Oklahoma and a specialist in extreme social isolation, {{took an interest in}} her case. Shurley noted that Genie's was the most severe case of isolation he had ever studied or heard about, which he maintained more than 20 years later. Over the next year and a half he came on three three-day visits to conduct daily observations and to carry out a sleep study, hoping to determine if Genie was autistic, <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> had sustained any brain damage, and <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> was born mentally disabled. Shurley concluded she was not autistic, with which later researchers concurred; he noted that she had a high level of emotional disturbance, but wrote that her eagerness for new stimuli and lack of behavioral defense mechanisms were uncharacteristic of autism.|$|E
25|$|Heseltine {{believed}} {{that he would have}} defeated Thatcher if she had contested the second ballot. It has been suggested that he should have withdrawn after weakening her on the first ballot, and that he would have been restored to the Cabinet <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> continued as Prime Minister; he writes that this was never seriously suggested at the time.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} notable storylines Lofty was {{involved}} with was his marriage to the teenage mother, Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully). Michelle and Lofty's church wedding was a massive target of press speculation before the episodes aired. They wanted to know two things, firstly the design of Michelle's dress, and secondly <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> would jilt Lofty at the altar.|$|E
5000|$|Eskarina Smith, {{commonly}} known as Esk, is the main character in Equal Rites, where she became the Unseen University's first and only known female graduate. Esk went on {{to work on a}} new kind of magic based on not using it at all, in the company of wunderkind wizard Simon. Although she was the pivotal character in Equal Rites, <b>she</b> was <b>not</b> seen <b>or</b> mentioned again until I Shall Wear Midnight, published a full 23 years later, where she was described as being both old and young due to her mastery of time travel. Though it is unclear <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she's</b> a practising part of the Ankh Morpork coven, perhaps due to her shared witchiness/wizardliness, Tiffany Aching is forewarned by Mrs. Proust that she would be contacted by her. In the future, she becomes a close friend of the adult Tiffany Aching. Esk is mentioned briefly again in The Shepherd's Crown, with an (unnamed) son.|$|R
5000|$|On 3 October 2008, Ashton was {{nominated}} by the UK to replace Peter Mandelson as the European Commissioner for Trade. Because European Commissioners may {{not engage in}} any other occupation during their term of office, <b>whether</b> gainful <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> <b>she</b> used the procedural device previously adopted in 1984 by Lord Cockfield [...] and took {{a leave of absence}} from the House of Lords on 14 October 2008, retaining her peerage but not her seat.|$|R
60|$|Dawes {{had been}} driven to the {{extremity}} of life, until he was afraid. He {{could go to the}} brink of death, he could lie on the edge and look in. Then, cowed, afraid, he had to crawl back, and like a beggar take what offered. There was a certain nobility in it. As Clara saw, he owned himself beaten, and he wanted to be taken back <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> That <b>she</b> could do for him. It was three o'clock.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to her European language skills, Alexandra speaks a bit of Cantonese. At {{a press conference in}} 1995, when asked <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> is able to communicate with Prince Henrik in Chinese, she stated that she believes that his Chinese is better than hers. She then clarified that Henrik speaks Mandarin Chinese while she speaks a little bit of Cantonese, which is the dominant language in Hong Kong.|$|E
25|$|Terris the Terrible, {{as he was}} dubbed, {{amassed a}} 13–2 record for Newark in 1938 while {{completing}} his 18 starts. But he was also at the centre of a controversy, when the Eagles players and staff hinted at a possible sentimental relation between Mrs. Manfrey and McDuffie. While there is no conclusive evidence to support <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> and McDuffie had an affair, Abe Manley promptly traded him to the New York Black Yankees.|$|E
25|$|Finally, Emma, Regina, Hook, and Snow chase {{down the}} beast {{in the woods}} that Emma {{believes}} {{to be the same}} one from the dream, and uses her magic to stop it. When they reach the creature, they are shocked to find a wolf, only to learn from Snow as she put Ruby's cloak on a big bad wolf; it's actually Ruby, who has shown up in the Underworld, but unsure of <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> is still alive. Snow tells Emma that her dream was actually a vision pointing them to Ruby.|$|E
50|$|Van Loon had {{two later}} marriages, to Eliza Helen (Jimmie) Criswell in 1920 and playwright Frances Goodrich Ames in 1927, {{but after a}} divorce from Ames he {{returned}} to Criswell (it is debatable <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> they remarried); <b>she</b> inherited his estate in 1944.|$|R
5000|$|Hotel {{staff who}} saw her that day {{said she was}} alone. Outside the hotel, Katie Orphan, manager of a nearby bookstore, {{was the only person}} who {{recalled}} seeing Lam that day. [...] "She was outgoing, very lively, very friendly," [...] while getting gifts to take home to her family, Orphan told CNN. [...] "was talking about what book she was getting and <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> what <b>she</b> was getting would be too heavy for her to carry around as she traveled." ...|$|R
50|$|The senior Church of England Chaplain {{is ranked}} {{within the church}} {{hierarchy}} as an Archdeacon - he or she holds the appointment of Archdeacon for the Army <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is also the Chaplain-General. The Senior Roman Catholic Chaplain (usually a CF1) is sometimes ranked as a monsignor.|$|R
25|$|When Bianca {{realizes that}} she has {{increasing}} romantic feelings for Maggie, she fears it is because Maggie has the same face and body as Frankie. She pushes Maggie into a relationship with Tim Dillon to help her get over the young woman. Maggie, however, ignores Tim, even while {{on a date with}} him and insists on being closer to Bianca. Bianca's forcefulness of pushing Tim and Maggie together does not work out. She later confronts Maggie to define <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> and Maggie are lovers in the making. Maggie says that she loves Bianca, but stresses that she is not in love with her.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of Friday 15 July 1977 while {{returning}} from a cruise and approaching Dunoon pier, Waverleys steering failed and she struck the rocks to the south called The Gantocks. Firmly aground and {{down by the head}} the ship was extensively damaged. There was some doubt about <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> would hold together on refloating but she did, and she was repaired and returned to service. Her survival was attributed to her heavier than normal post World War II construction which had included provision for minesweeping gear and a deck gun in case she was ever requisitioned by the Admiralty for use in a future war.|$|E
25|$|The Oregon Coast Aquarium (OCA) in Newport, Oregon {{where the}} orca Keiko was kept {{prior to his}} {{translocation}} to Iceland, offered its facilities to rehabilitate Springer for a one-year period, after which a scientific panel would determine <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> was fit to return to Johnstone Strait, BC. Media reports soon revealed that OCA was deep in debt and bound by {{an agreement with the}} Free Willy-Keiko Foundation (FWKF) that Keiko's former tank, built by FWKF, could never again house a wild orca. Furthermore, growing scientific opinion was that rehabilitating Springer in a concrete tank would further acclimate the orca to humans and likely result in permanent captivity. OCA withdrew its offer.|$|E
50|$|The Elling Woman is {{believed}} to have been hanged, like the Tollund Man. The estimated year of death was dated to approximately 280 BCE in the Nordic Iron Age, also around the time of the Tollund Man; however, it is not possible to confirm <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> both <b>she</b> and he were killed at exactly the same time. It also initially might have been impossible to tell the sex of her body, if the hair had not been preserved, although X rays were taken of her pelvis, which proved she was female.|$|R
5000|$|Matt Molgaard {{praised the}} {{character}} saying [...] "Handicapped, forever wheelchair-bound, Dourif’s character, Nica, doesn’t look too imposing or powerful. In fact, initially she {{looks a bit}} fragile. And then shit gets crazy in the film and Nica’s defensive mindset spins 180 degrees. Survival instinct takes over, and <b>whether</b> handicapped <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> <b>she’s</b> <b>not</b> going down without a fight for the ages." [...] Adam Frazier who gave the film a mixed review praised Fiona's performance stating [...] "Aside from Fiona Dourif, who makes a solid Final Girl, many of the performances are amateurish." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{eyes are}} {{often viewed as}} {{important}} features of facial expressions. Aspects such as blinking rate {{can be used to}} indicate <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> a person is nervous <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is lying. Also, eye contact is considered an important aspect of interpersonal communication. However, there are cultural differences regarding the social propriety of maintaining eye contact <b>or</b> <b>not.</b>|$|R
25|$|The American Prospect {{noted in}} 2008 that Onyango risked being persecuted and {{tortured}} in Kenya if she returned, {{and said that}} risk to her family members had increased, <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> was deported, because of her asylum case having been leaked and widely publicized internationally. They also noted that due to the heightened danger in Kenya, her asylum claim in the US was bolstered. After her case was revealed in international media, Onyango traveled to stay with unidentified friends in Cleveland, Ohio. She had felt threatened in Boston, as people called and knocking on her door at all hours. The Boston police {{said that there was}} a problem with curiosity seekers and paparazzi.|$|E
25|$|Elder {{sister of}} Yhun Ah-Rin. Ah-Rin {{is much more}} stoic than her sister. After a {{confrontation}} with Bi-Ryu, she is left injured and drained of energy. It is here that she is captured and taken to Mother Demon's palace, where she is held captive until Yu-Sae Ha rescues her. It is discovered that she had killed Demon Mother's younger brother in an earlier confrontation during her search for Rin. She is eventually paired up with Yu Sae-Ha in a secondary storyline. Unlike her sister, Ah-Ran seems to have nearly, if not completely, mastered the stance, as she has displayed advanced techniques. However, as Yu Sae-Ha has absorbed her ki, it is unknown <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> is still able to fight.|$|E
25|$|Frost also expresses {{doubts about}} <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she</b> {{deserves to be}} an X-Man, only to have veteran X-Man Wolverine assure her that she has earned her place on the team. Later, when Xavier {{attempts}} to warn Cyclops about his recent encounter with Sinister, Frost manages to enter the Professor's mind undetected. During {{the course of their}} encounter, Frost forces Xavier to relive each of his mistakes and morally ambiguous decisions made under altruistic pretenses. It is also revealed that while Frost is just as angry with Xavier as Cyclops is, she also wants to help him move on with his life. Frost points the Professor in a new direction by forcing him to relive the death of Moira MacTaggert and reminding him of her last words.|$|E
5000|$|For {{her final}} {{appearance}} as a two-year-old, Rosdhu Queen was {{moved up to}} Group One class for the Cheveley Park Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 29 September. In her fourth race, she had her fourth different jockey, being partnered by Johnny Murtagh. The Princess Margaret Stakes winner Maureen (ridden by Hughes), started 2/1 favourite with Rosdhu Queen the 4/1 second choice in an eleven-runner field. The other runners included The Gold Cheongsam (winner of her last three races including a £300,000 sales race at Doncaster), Winning Express (Dick Poole Fillies' Stakes), Sendyourlovetome (Grangecon Stud Stakes, Cherry Hinton Stakes), Ceiling Kitty (Queen Mary Stakes), Hoyam (Roses Stakes) and Baileys Jubilee. Murtagh immediately sent the filly {{to the front and}} raced along the far rail (the right hand side from the jockeys' viewpoint). Several challengers emerged in the closing stages but Rosdhu Queen kept on well under pressure to win by a length and a nose from Winning Express and Baileys Jubilee. Murtagh commented [...] "She battled well and wasn't for passing. She's fast". Discussing the filly's stamina and future prospects, William Haggas said [...] "I didn't think she'd stay six in the Lowther, but she went again when <b>she</b> needed to. <b>Whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>she's</b> a Guineas filly I don't know, but why not?" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{addiction}} team {{works with}} those {{men and women}} concerned with their addiction and wishing to address the problem.

50|$|Another major {{controversy}} {{is that only}} the motorists who use the CIQ complex to travel to Singapore will be charged the toll; <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> drives on the EDL.
