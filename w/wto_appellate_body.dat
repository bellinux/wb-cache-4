40|$|What makes {{regulation}} rational? And why is rationality {{important to}} an international tribunal? In the World Trade Organization (WTO) context, these questions have had significant implications for the public policy of its Member countries. The <b>WTO</b> <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body’s</b> emerging emphasis on means–ends rationality testing {{is based on the}} questionable premise that consistent regulation is non-discriminatory. It has led regulators, such as the EU, to defend—and probably even construct—complex regulation in a way that emphasizes conformity to one overarching policy objective. More surprisingly, the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> has re-cast itself as public policy watchdog, pointing out when governments {{do not appear to be}} committed to their cause. In response, governments have strengthened disputed regulation, rather than making it less trade-restrictive. This retreat to rationality can be seen as a result of a difficult challenge facing the Appellate Body: how to review national regulation without passing judgment on it. More specifically, the rationality test pays the price of the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body’s</b> retreat from proportionality...|$|R

In 2009, the United States imposed {{additional}} tariffs for {{a three-year}} period on imports of automotive tires from China under a special-safeguard provision included in China's Protocol of Accession to the WTO. China challenged the measure in the WTO. The case marked the first WTO dispute in which a challenged safeguard was upheld by the Appellate Body; the first in which an accession protocol was used successfully as a defense; and the first that China lost as a complaining party.

40|$|Precaution” is {{increasingly}} {{accepted as a}} basis for governmental policy in the areas of public health and environment on both the domestic and international levels. A precautionary perspective counsels action to avert danger or threats in situations of scientific uncertainty or incomplete information. Precautionary approaches find expression in internationally harmonized formulations as non-binding exhortations, binding treaties, and meta-level principles. Precaution is a particular challenge to free trade agreements, whose purpose is to eliminate unjustified barriers to trade. In that context, precaution as a justification for a challenged governmental measure may appear to be nothing more than a pretext for protectionism. This article traces the treatment of precaution in the jurisprudence of the World Trade Organization, and particularly under the Uruguay Round Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards. From this perspective, the piece analyzes a number of controversial disputes, including those over hormone-treated beef and genetically modified food and crops, and makes recommendations for an alternative treatment of this important question by the <b>WTO’s</b> <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article {{applies the}} {{behavioral}} economics theory of Omission Bias to the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), assessing whether <b>WTO</b> and <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body’s</b> assessment of “foregone revenue” as illegal subsidies indicate a bias against finding culpability in omissions {{as distinct from}} commissions.

Specifically the test for this kind of subsidization is complex and its application is frustrated by the lack of tax expertise among <b>WTO</b> panelists and <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> members as well as the opacity in many countries’ revenue and tax incentive regimes.

40|$|This paper aims {{to explore}} the {{constituent}} grammars of the margin of appreciation as a concept, {{and the way it}} is used by world trade judges, as well as the reasons for, and the immediate and potential outcomes directly and indirectly arising from, the plea to the concept when deciding WTO disputes relating to domestic societal regulation. In doing so, it is particularly important to demonstrate, through a detailed analysis of GATT and WTO jurisprudence, that GATT/WTO judges have applied the necessity test in order to follow different political agendas at different times – and also using the necessity narrative in various ways, including the hypothetical aim to ‘discipline’ members to regulate in the least trade-restrictive way possible. Until the US-COOL Article 21. 5 decision, under the TBT, world trade adjudicators, and especially the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body,</b> added nuances to the necessity test with considerations related to the right of WTO members to regulate in order to set their own level of protection. The latest relevant interpretative development in US-COOL Article 21. 5, namely the <b>WTO</b> <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body’s</b> plea for the margin of appreciation concept, may have interesting implications for future WTO jurisprudence. At least two scenarios are possible. Either the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> has tacitly suggested in this ruling that members have certain discretion in considering what could constitute a legitimate objective of a particular regulation. Or the <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body’s</b> interpretation implies that the permissible degree of regulatory discretion of members actually rather depends on the importance of the objective to a member, and not – or to a lesser extent – on its legitimacy, so the latter should not be placed under strict scrutiny...|$|R

5000|$|Former section 114 of the United States Internal Revenue Code {{excluded}} [...] "extraterritorial income" [...] which constituted [...] "qualifying {{foreign trade}} income" [...] under former section 941 from income. The {{effect of these}} provisions was a reduced tax burden in exchange for increased exports, creating an incentive for individuals and businesses within the United States to export. In August 2001, a panel of the World Trade Organization ruled that former section 114 of the United States Internal Revenue Code constituted {{a violation of the}} Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures as a prohibited export subsidy, and a <b>WTO</b> <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> affirmed the finding in January 2002. The finding was based on the fact the provision resulted in the United States government forgoing revenue to which it was otherwise entitled and the fact the resulting subsidy was conditioned on export performance.

40|$|Canada – Certain Measures Affecting the Renewable Energy Sector (Canada FIT), {{appears to}} be the first-ever case at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to address the tenuous ‘trade versus climate’ debate in the context of {{renewable}} energy policies. Feed-in Tariffs (FIT) for renewable energy, which have emerged as a popular domestic policy tool to address climate change, share an extremely controversial relationship with the international trade regime, especially with the legality of such support schemes increasingly coming under the WTO scanner. In this article, the authors focus on four aspects that emerge from the decisions made by the <b>WTO’s</b> Panel and <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> in this case, namely the clarification of the blurred legal status of renewable energy support schemes under WTO law; a new ‘public goods’ exception; an evolving, “activist” WTO jurisprudence; and the imminent end of domestic content requirements in renewable energy policies.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, the {{international}} trading system faced a new challenge: reinventing its mandate under the light of the sustainable development challenges confronting the global community in the twenty-first century. This challenge has emerged central to the identity of the WTO, since the organization is no longer simply about removing obstacles to trade, like its predecessor – the GATT, 1947. Instead, the WTO is facing the loaded question of how far it will go in scrutinizing the exercise of governmental authority of Members, in regard to internal regulatory issues that relate to trade. Facing this question has been far from easy, especially in connection with disputes concerning health, safety and environmental (HSE) measures, since HSE-related disputes touch upon core environmental and human rights issues. The <b>WTO’s</b> <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> has approached the tensions that surface in the adjudication of these disputes by engaging in a process of dialogue among the various legal regimes that bear on HSE measures. This process of normative dialogue and interpretation has allowed the WTO to overcome the GATT’s isolation by situating WTO law within the broader public international law universe. Normative dialogue has thus fundamentally transformed the evolving WTO law concerning HSE measures. This article explores the contours of this proposition, with a view to assessing the degree to which WTO law secures the quantum of policy space that governments need to realize human rights and protection of the environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{footwear}} case {{provides an}} example of the complexities of World Trade Organization (WTO) rules on the use of safeguards, and of the interaction of multilateral and regional processes of liberalization. As a result both of Argentina's unilateral liberalization and the removal of barriers within Mercosur, imports of footwear increased rapidly. As Mercosur provides no intra-regional safeguard mechanism, the government of Argentina responded by applying import relief and WTO safeguards against third countries. The WTO Dispute Settlement Body addressed these measures and as a consequence, Argentina dismantled most of them, leading to four main conclusions: The jurisprudence of the <b>WTO's</b> <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> has created serious uncertainty as to when a country can use safeguards. This does not contribute to the political balance that has to be maintained when developing countries implement trade liberalization programs. In fact, it detracts from this crucial goal. It is an error to negotiate ambiguous multilateral agreements on the expectation that the WTO Dispute Settlement mechanism will clarify them. An overvalued currency heightened the industry's problems. In the case of footwear, the decline in imports following the recent devaluation was more important than that following the implementation of earlier relief measures. The political economy of liberalization also indicates the need for regional agreements to include adequate transition mechanisms that will facilitate adjustment to free trade and to maintain support for it.

40|$|Under {{the legal}} {{framework}} of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), countries have great flexibility to unilaterally adopt environmental regulations that have effect within their territories only. However, the same discretion {{does not apply to}} measures that adversely affect imports or exports. An absence of clear guidelines on how to address some of the attendant issues poses challenges to the effectiveness of a trade-environment linkage. Not surprisingly, attempts to link the environment and trade have resulted in a number of jurisprudentially significant cases in which the <b>WTO's</b> Panel and <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> have tried to address critical questions about the Organisation's capacity to address or manage legal or quasi-legal subjects falling outside the scope of its legal framework. In this regard the Panel and <b>Appellate</b> <b>Body</b> reports in the case of United States - Measures Affecting the Production and Sale of Clove Cigarettes (US-Clove Cigarettes) have re-ignited the debate on the Organisation's existential challenge of balancing the rights of the sovereign to freely regulate matters pertaining to health or the environment within its domestic domain with the need to maintain the sanctity of the multilateral trade order.
