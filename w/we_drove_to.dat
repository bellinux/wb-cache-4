2500|$|On May 15, 1939, Antonina Pirozhkova {{was awakened}} by four NKVD agents {{pounding}} upon the door of their Moscow apartment. Although surprised, she agreed to accompany them to Babel's dacha in Peredelkino. Babel was then placed under arrest. According to Pirozhkova: [...] "In the car, {{one of the men}} sat in back with Babel and me while the other one sat in front with the driver. 'The worst part of this is that my mother won't be getting my letters', and then he was silent for a long time. I could not say a single word. Babel asked the secret policeman sitting next to him, 'So I guess you don't get too much sleep, do you?' And he even laughed. As we approached Moscow, I said to Babel, 'I'll be waiting for you, it will be as if you've gone to Odessa... only there won't be any letters....' He answered, 'I ask you to see that the child not be made miserable.' [...] "But I don't know what my destiny will be." [...] At this point, the man sitting beside Babel said to me, [...] "We have no claims whatsoever against you." [...] <b>We</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the Lubyanka Prison and through the gates. The car stopped before the massive, closed door where two sentries stood guard. Babel kissed me hard and said, [...] "Someday we'll see each other..." [...] And without looking back, {{he got out of the}} car and went through that door.|$|E

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> {{the police}} station and Mr. Cullen ushered us at once into a private room, where an {{inspector}} was seated at a table.|$|E
60|$|I was {{punctual}} <b>to</b> my appointment. <b>We</b> <b>drove</b> together <b>to</b> the asylum.|$|R

6000|$|... "Why, {{the second}} Sunday I knew you, when <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> out <b>to</b> Moraga Valley behind Prince and King. You spread the lunch that day." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{a little}} after one o'clock, now. <b>We</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the Grand Duke Michael's, a mile away, in {{response}} to his invitation, previously given.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Master," [...] said Bes {{to me as}} <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the palace, [...] "I almost {{wish that}} we were back in another chariot hunting lions in the East." ...|$|E
6000|$|... {{and acting}} under {{advice of the}} cabman, <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> Addison's Alma Hotel, which we find to be in Prince's Street, having Scott's {{monument}} {{a few hundred yards}} below, and the Castle Hill about as much above.|$|E
50|$|Each {{place we}} visited in this trip was unique {{in its own}} way. It was already evening by then and <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> back <b>to</b> Pune with {{feelings}} of contentment.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>drove</b> back <b>to</b> {{my hotel}} {{and waited for}} Harold. To my horror and alarm, he never came near us. I might almost have doubted him--if {{he had not been}} Harold.|$|R
6000|$|In due {{sequence}} of events <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> up <b>to</b> the Temeraire, and alighted. A youth in livery received us on the door-step. 'Looks well,' said Bullfinch confidentially. And then aloud, 'Coffee- room!' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> {{the house}} {{to see if the}} refurnishing was done. It will be {{completed}} to-morrow--Saturday. As Mr. Blake foretold, Betteredge raised no further obstacles. From first to last, he was ominously polite, and ominously silent.|$|E
60|$|Having left Lestrade at his rooms, <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> our hotel, {{where we}} found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained {{expression}} upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> Stephano's. It {{struck me}} that Luigi's {{greeting}} was scarcely so cordial as usual. He piloted us, however, to the table usually occupied by Mr. Parker. On the way he took the opportunity of drawing me a little apart.|$|E
60|$|This {{concession}} {{was received}} by poor Guert with profound gratitude; and he assured me, as <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> back <b>to</b> town, {{that he had}} not felt so happy for the last two months.|$|R
6000|$|Just {{before my}} {{return to the}} city, he sent for a team, and {{together}} <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> down <b>to</b> the little Neshonoc burying ground. [...] "I want to inspect your mother's grave," [...] he explained.|$|R
6000|$|... "The blundering fool," [...] Holmes said, bitterly, as <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> back <b>to</b> our lodgings. [...] "Just {{to think}} of his having such an {{incomparable}} bit of good luck, and not taking advantage of it." ...|$|R
60|$|July 19.--I {{finished}} two leaves this morning, {{and received}} the Hamiltons and Mrs. Hemans to breakfast. Afterwards <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> Yarrow and showed Mrs. Hemans the lions. The party dined with us, and stayed till evening. Of course no more work.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> Ashestiel in the morning, after I {{had written}} a good task, or nearly so (nay, I lie, it wanted half a page), and passed a {{pleasant}} day. Terry read Bobadil in the evening, which he has, I think, improved.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the Louvre, {{and visited}} the remains from Nineveh. They are fewer in number {{than those in}} the British Museum, which I have not yet seen. But the pair of human-headed, winged bulls are said to be equal in size to any.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>drove</b> {{forthwith}} <b>to</b> {{the proper}} authorities, who, on hearing the facts, at once arranged to accept Lord Southminster and White as Queen's evidence, neither being the actual forger. We also telegraphed to Paris to have Higginson arrested, Lord Southminster giving us up his assumed name {{with the utmost}} cheerfulness, and without one moment's compunction. Mr. Hayes was quite right: each conspirator was only too ready to save himself by betraying his fellows. Then <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> on <b>to</b> Bow Street (Lord Southminster consoling himself with a cigarette on the way), {{just in time for}} Harold's case, which was to be taken, by special arrangement, at 3.30.|$|R
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>drove</b> up <b>to</b> London in her {{comfortable}} chariot: {{the children}} and servants following in a post-chaise. I paid, of course, for everything; and until our house in Berkeley Square was painted, we stopped at [...] "Stevens's Hotel." ...|$|R
60|$|I had {{had enough}} of it and I dragged Mr. Bundercombe away. <b>We</b> <b>drove</b> back <b>to</b> Prince's Gardens in {{somewhat}} ominous silence. Mr. Wymans would have taken his leave, but Mr. Bundercombe begged him to come into the library.|$|R
60|$|After Madame M. and I had {{finished}} the Pantheon <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the Conciergerie; for I {{wanted to see the}} prison of the hapless Marie Antoinette. That restless architectural mania, which never lets any thing alone here, is rapidly modernizing it; the scaffoldings are up, and workmen busy in making it as little historical as possible. Nevertheless, the old, gloomy arched gateway, and the characteristic peaked Norman towers, still remain; and we stopped our carriage {{the other side of the}} Seine, to get a good look at it. <b>We</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the door, and tried to go in, but were told that we could not without an order from somebody or other. (I forget who;) so we were obliged to content ourselves with an outside view.|$|E
6000|$|... "August 1st.--Nothing to record, {{but that}} I {{have had a}} long, quiet, happy day with Midwinter. He hired a carriage, and <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> Richmond, and dined there. After to-day's experience, it is {{impossible}} to deceive myself any longer. Come what may of it, I love him.|$|E
60|$|At {{the proper}} hour, General Lafayette {{had the good}} nature to call and take me up, and we proceeded, at once, for Mr. M'Lane. With this gentleman <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the Palais Royal, my old brother officer, Mr. T----, who was {{included}} in the arrangement, following in his own carriage.|$|E
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> out <b>to</b> Mr. Alexander's. His place is called Paradise, and very justly, being one {{more of those}} home Edens in which England abounds, where, without ostentation or display, every appliance of rational enjoyment surrounds one.|$|R
60|$|On {{the next}} day <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> over <b>to</b> Newcome, hoping perhaps to find that Lord Highgate had taken the warning sent to him and quitted the place. But we were disappointed. He was walking {{in front of the}} hotel, where a {{thousand}} persons might see him as well as ourselves.|$|R
60|$|But to {{be brief}} in my tale. Again, ere {{we came to}} the level, Slipped from its axle a wheel; so that, to be plain in my statement, A matter of twelve hundred yards or more, as the {{distance}} may be, We travelled upon one wheel, until <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> up <b>to</b> the station.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> a quiet street {{not very}} far from the Ritz Hotel. Mr. Parker led us across the {{pavement}} and we entered a block of flats. The entrance hall was dimly lit and {{there seemed to be}} no one about. Mr. Parker, however, rang for a lift, which came promptly down.|$|E
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> the “Bell Inn” comes a mitred {{coach with}} our old friend Lockwood beside the coachman. My Lady Castlewood and the bishop were inside; {{she gave a}} little scream when she saw us. The two coaches entered the inn almost together; the {{landlord}} and people coming out with lights to welcome the visitors.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>drove</b> <b>to</b> {{the hotel}} at which {{my friend was}} {{accustomed}} to reside {{when he was in}} London. His long sleep on the journey seemed, in some degree, to have relieved him. We dined together in his private room. When the servants had withdrawn, I found that the unhappy result of the duel was still preying on his mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "There was a stream," [...] I answered; [...] "if anything, {{too much}} stream. The stream {{was the first}} thing your mother noticed. She noticed it {{a quarter of an hour}} before we came to it--before we knew it was the stream. <b>We</b> <b>drove</b> back <b>to</b> the town, and she bought a smelling-bottle, the larger size.|$|R
6000|$|... "But to {{be brief}} in my tale.

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>drove</b> first <b>to</b> the cathedral, which, {{with an old}} deserted church, {{seemingly}} part of itself, forms a pile of Gothic architecture, {{a wilderness}} of spires, minarets, arches, and what not, more picturesque than any cathedral I have seen. It stands high on a sort of platform overlooking a military parade ground, and reached by a long flight of steps.|$|R
