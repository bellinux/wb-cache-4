The men of the Auxiliary formed seventeen departments and held more than 100 congresses with a variety of political, social and technical agendas; the women's branch held just one congress.

5|$|After the Second <b>World</b> <b>Congress</b> in 1948, the International Secretariat {{attempted}} to open communications with Josip Broz Tito's regime in Yugoslavia. In their analysis, it {{differed from the}} rest of the Eastern Bloc because it was established by the partisans of World War II who had fought against Nazi occupation, as opposed to by Stalin's invading armies. The British RCP, led by Jock Haston and supported by Ted Grant, were highly critical of this move.|$|E
5|$|The Secretariat {{organised}} a Fifth <b>World</b> <b>Congress</b> in October 1957. Mandel and Pierre Frank appraised the Algerian {{revolution and}} surmised {{that it was}} essential to reorient in the colonial states and neocolonies towards the emerging guerrilla-led revolutions. According to Robert Alexander, Ernest Mandel has written that an organisation in Indonesia, the Partai Acoma, was affiliate to the FI from 1959 until the 1965 coup in that country.|$|E

2500|$|As was {{the case}} with the Communist International, formal <b>World</b> <b>Congresses</b> of RILU {{happened}} with decreasing frequency over the life of the organization. This stands to reason, since RILU <b>World</b> <b>Congresses</b> were scheduled in conjunction with the <b>World</b> <b>Congresses</b> of the Comintern itself, generally launching upon conclusion of the Comintern event. And just as the Comintern began making use of shorter, smaller, and less formal international conventions called [...] "Enlarged Plenums of the Executive Committee" [...] to handle international policy-making, similar gatherings were adopted for RILU, called [...] "Sessions of the Central Council." ...|$|R
25|$|Sewall {{obtained}} {{permission to}} hold the <b>World's</b> <b>Congress</b> of Representative Women, {{the first meeting of}} the International Council of Women, in conjunction with the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. Sewall struggled with other leaders over control of the gathering. Bertha Palmer, president of the fair's Board of Lady Managers and president of the woman's branch of the <b>World’s</b> <b>Congress</b> Auxiliary's, and Ellen Henrotin, vice president of the auxiliary’s woman's branch, viewed Sewall as a radical feminist and resented the implication that the National Council of Women was organizing the <b>World's</b> <b>Congress.</b> Sewall threatened to resign, but remained with the organizing group, who hosted a successful meeting. The weeklong <b>World's</b> <b>Congress</b> brought 126 national women’s organizations together from around the world. Its estimated attendance was more than 150,000.|$|R
5|$|The Third <b>World</b> <b>Congress</b> in 1951 {{resolved}} {{that the}} economies of the East European states and their political regimes had come to resemble that of the USSR more and more. These states were then described as deformed workers states in an analogy with the degenerated workers state in Russia. The term deformed was used rather than degenerated, because no workers' revolution had led to the foundation of these states.|$|E

Unlike Windows 8.1 itself, this cumulative update is distributed through Windows Update, and must be installed in order to receive any further patches for Windows 8.1.|$|E
5|$|The Sixth <b>World</b> <b>Congress</b> in 1961 {{marked a}} {{lessening}} {{of the political}} divisions between the majority of supporters of the International Secretariat and {{the leadership of the}} SWP in the United States. In particular, the congress stressed support for the Cuban revolution and a growing emphasis on building parties in the imperialist countries. The sixth congress also criticised the Lanka Sama Samaja Party, its Sri Lankan section, for seeming to support the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, which they saw as bourgeois nationalists; the U.S. SWP made similar criticisms.|$|E

5|$|This {{perspective}} {{was accepted}} within the Fourth International, yet sowed {{the seeds for}} the split in 1953. At the Third <b>World</b> <b>Congress,</b> the sections agreed with the perspective of an international civil war. The French section disagreed with the associated tactic of entryism sui generis, and held that Pablo was underestimating the independent role {{of the working class}} parties in the Fourth International. The leaders {{of the majority of the}} Trotskyist organisation in France, Marcel Bleibtreu and Pierre Lambert, refused to follow the line of the International. The International leadership had them replaced by a minority, leading to a permanent split in the French section.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{theme of}} the defense was that the CPUSA sought to convert the US to {{socialism}} by education, not by force. The defense claimed {{that most of the}} prosecution's documentary evidence came from older texts that pre-dated the 1935 Seventh <b>World</b> <b>Congress</b> of the Comintern, after which the CPUSA rejected violence as a means of change. Starobin, p 207. The defense attempted to introduce documents into evidence which represented the CPUSA's advocacy of peace, claiming that these policies superseded the older texts that the prosecution had introduced which emphasized violence. Medina excluded most of the material proposed by the defense because it did not directly pertain to the specific documents the prosecution had produced. As a result, the defense complained that they were unable to portray the totality of their belief system to the jury.|$|E
5|$|Heathen {{influences}} were {{apparent in}} forms of black metal from the 1990s, where lyrics and themes often expressed {{a longing for}} a pre-Christian Northern past; the mass media typically associated this music genre with Satanism. The Pagan metal genre—which emerged from the fragmentation of the extreme metal scene in Northern Europe during the early 1990s—came {{to play an important}} role in the North European Pagan scene. Many musicians involved in Viking metal were also practicing Heathens, with many metal bands embracing the heroic masculinity embodied in Norse mythological figures like Odin and Thor. From the mid-1990s, the Internet greatly aided the propagation of Heathenry in various parts of the world. That decade also saw the strong growth of racist Heathenry among those incarcerated within the U.S. prison system as a result of outreach programs established by various Heathen groups, a project begun in the 1980s. During this period, many Heathen groups also began to interact increasingly with other ethnic-oriented Pagan groups in Eastern Europe, such as Lithuanian Romuva, and many joined the <b>World</b> <b>Congress</b> of Ethnic Religions upon its formation in 1998.|$|E

5|$|In 1919 Davies married Margaret ("Madge") Eley from Cardiff; {{three daughters}} were {{subsequently}} born. The {{years following the}} First World War saw economic decline and hardship in the South Wales coalfields, conditions which deepened Davies's radical instincts, {{and he began to}} acquire a reputation for militancy. Contrary to mainstream Labour Party policy, Davies advocated workers' control rather than the nationalisation of the mining industry. In 1921 he unsuccessfully advocated affiliation of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB, precursor of the National Union of Mineworkers or NUM) with the Red International of Labour Unions (RILU). The following year he was a delegate from the SWMF to the Second <b>World</b> <b>Congress</b> of the RILU in Moscow, and acquired a warm sympathy towards the Soviet system. He did not, however, join the recently formed Communist Party of Great Britain, and remained within the Labour Party.|$|E
5|$|The {{sections}} of the International that recognised {{the leadership of the}} International Secretariat remained optimistic about the possibilities for increasing the International's political influence and extended the entrism into social democratic parties which was already underway in Britain, Austria and elsewhere. The 1954 congress emphasised entrism into communist parties and nationalist parties in the colonies, pressing for democratic reforms, ostensibly to encourage the left-wing they perceived to exist in the communist parties to join with them in a revolution. Tensions developed between those who subscribed to the mainstream views of Pablo and a minority that argued unsuccessfully against open work. A number of these delegates walked out of the <b>World</b> <b>Congress,</b> and would eventually leave the International, including the leader of the new British section, John Lawrence, George Clarke, Michele Mestre (a leader of the French section), and Murray Dowson (a leader of the Canadian group).|$|E
5|$|Composer Engelbert Humperdinck, after {{attending}} {{the debut of}} his opera Königskinder at the Metropolitan Opera, sailed on George Washington in early January 1911 in order to attend the opera's Berlin premiere. American sculptor George Grey Barnard returned to New York in April amidst controversy over some of his works. An organization called the National Society for Protection of Morals was protesting the presence of nude figures in sculptures he executed for the Pennsylvania State Capitol in Harrisburg. July saw George Washington transporting a menagerie of sorts. The liner was carrying a shipment from India of 6 white peacocks, 2 lions, 2 elephants, 150 monkeys, and some 2,000 canaries destined for the recently organized Saint Louis Zoological Park. In August, two men of note—both headed for Berlin—sailed on George Washington. Nathan Straus, co-owner with his brother Isidor of R.H. Macy & Company, sailed as the U.S. delegate to the third <b>world</b> <b>congress</b> {{for the protection of}} infants held in Berlin. Congressman Richard Bartholdt, charged by President Taft to deliver a statue of Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben to the German government, sailed with the statue, which was a gift from the American people.|$|E
