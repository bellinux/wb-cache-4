5|$|A.P. Hill has {{received}} some criticism for his ineffective performance. His actions caused {{the battle to}} begin and then escalate on July 1, despite Lee's orders not to bring on a general engagement (although historians point out that Hill kept Lee <b>well</b> <b>informed</b> of his actions during the day). However, Hill's illness minimized his personal involvement {{in the remainder of}} the battle, and Lee took the explicit step of temporarily removing troops from Hill's corps and giving them to Longstreet for Pickett's Charge.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the storm, the Government of El Salvador was criticized for failing to keep the public <b>well</b> <b>informed.</b> It provided over $300,000 in aid and declared a state of emergency; additionally, a state of mourning was declared. The United Nations World Food program began distributing food set aside for victims of the El Salvador Civil War. The U.S. Embassy in Guatemala provided $25,000 in aid for the country. Mexican authorities rushed to supply food and water to the homeless.|$|E

5|$|Blue Alert warnings, which {{indicate}} that a cyclone may affect the warning area within 48hours, were issued for Cyclone Rosita on the morning on 19 April. They were upgraded to a Yellow Alert– an indication that a cyclone appears inevitable to affect the warning area in 12hours– at 1 pm, then to a Red Alert– meaning the cyclone is imminent– at 8 pm. In general, residents were <b>well</b> <b>informed</b> of the warnings through the radio. Residents from the low-lying downtown areas evacuated to homes in more elevated locations. Two of the three available evacuation shelters were opened and co-ordinated by the Department of Family and Children's Services. 280people took shelter in schools, while 78 residents from Bidyadanga were evacuated to Port Hedland or Broome. The people that stayed in the settlement sheltered {{in the church and}} family homes. Staff and guests at the Eco Beach tourist resort received warnings from Rosita early on 19 April and made a timely return to Broome before the cyclone hit.|$|E
5|$|The {{representatives of}} France, Great Britain, and the Dutch Republic signed the Treaty of Utrecht on 11 April 1713 (N.S.) – the Emperor and his German allies, {{including}} the Elector of Hanover, continued {{with the war}} before finally accepting the general settlement the following year. The Treaty marked Britain's emergence as a great power. Domestically, however, the country remained divided between Whig and Tory, Jacobite and Hanoverian factions. By now Oxford and St John (Viscount Bolingbroke since 1712) – absorbed entirely by their mutual enmity and political squabbling – had effectively wrecked the Tory administration. Marlborough had been kept <b>well</b> <b>informed</b> of events while in exile and had remained a powerful figure on the political scene, not least because of the personal attachment the Queen still retained for him. After {{the death of his}} daughter Elizabeth from smallpox in March 1714, Marlborough contacted the Queen. Although the contents of the letter are unknown it is possible that Anne may have summoned him home. Either way, it seems that an agreement was reached to reinstate the Duke in his former offices.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} watch {{was issued}} for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands late on November15, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning six hours later. By that time, Lenny was projected to move over Puerto Rico. After Lenny made its closest {{approach to the}} island, the hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning on November17, which was discontinued the following day along with the advisories in the Virgin Islands. In Puerto Rico, the media maintained continuous coverage on the hurricane based on statements and warnings from the San Juan National Weather Service office. Based on the coverage, the public was <b>well</b> <b>informed</b> of the hurricane's threat to the island. Before the storm {{and as a result}} of its impact, around 4,700people evacuated to 191shelters. This included 1,190residents in Ponce who evacuated to 27schools, as well as 584people in western Puerto Rico. Officials closed all schools, banned the sale of alcohol, and ordered a freeze on the price of emergency supplies. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated six medical assistance teams, three medical support teams, and two advance medical assessment units. The agency stored five days' worth of food in schools in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Before the hurricane's arrival, U.S. Virgin Islands governor Charles Wesley Turnbull declared a state of emergency. In St. Croix, 309people rode out the storm in shelters. Officials opened eight shelters in the British Virgin Islands. There, airlines and hotels assisted in evacuating tourists from the area.|$|E

5|$|After this defeat Spinola {{took his}} {{remaining}} six galleys back to Lisbon and filled his vessels with pay chests for Flanders. During the sailing to Flanders {{he took an}} English ship, which he left at A Coruña. At Santander he took on a further 400 troops to complete the Tercio complement of 1,600 men. In England word had spread that Spinola {{was on his way}} in an attempt to run the English channel again. His heading was for Sluis with the six galleys, of whose approach was <b>well</b> <b>informed</b> by Robert Cecil even when they arrived at Blavet in Brittany at the beginning of October. Queen Elizabeth decided to act, so she appointed Sir Robert Mansell to join with the States fleet before Dunkirk and Sluis, to see what they could do to impeach them. Meanwhile, the States of Holland and West Frisia had sent a flotilla of nine ships under Vice-Admiral Jacob van Duyvenvoorde to intercept Spinola but when this force arrived near Spain, Spinola had already escaped to the north. Van Duyvenvoorde, coping with an outbreak of smallpox by which he was afflicted himself, sent four of his ships back north under Jan Adriaanszoon Cant, known by the English as Jan van Cant.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the men of}} Ifaluk atoll, costly {{signalling}} {{theory can}} also explain why men torch fish. Torch fishing is a ritualized method of fishing on Ifaluk whereby men use torches made from dried coconut fronds to catch large dog-toothed tuna. Preparation for torch fishing requires significant time investments and involves {{a great deal of}} organization. Due to the time and energetic costs of preparation, torch fishing results in net caloric losses for fishers. Therefore, torch fishing is a handicap that serves to signal men’s productivity. Torch fishing is the most advertised fishing occupation on Ifaluk. Women and others usually spend time observing the canoes as they sail beyond the reef. Also, local rituals help to broadcast information about which fishers are successful and enhance fishers’ reputations during the torch fishing season. Several ritual behavioural and dietary constraints clearly distinguish torch fishers from other men. First, males are only permitted to torch fish if they participated {{on the first day of}} the fishing season. The community is <b>well</b> <b>informed</b> as to who participates on this day, and can easily identify the torch fishers. Second, torch fishers receive all of their meals at the canoe house and are prohibited from eating certain foods. People frequently discuss the qualities of torch fishermen. On Ifaluk, women claim that they are looking for hard-working mates. With the distinct sexual division of labor on Ifaluk, industriousness is a highly valued characteristic in males. Torch fishing thus provides women with reliable information on the work ethic of prospective mates, which makes it an honest costly signal.|$|E
5|$|In 406 BC Alcibiades set {{out from}} Athens with 1,500 hoplites and a hundred ships. He failed to take Andros {{and then he went}} on to Samos. Later he moved to Notium, closer to the enemy at Ephesus. In the {{meanwhile}} Tissaphernes had been replaced by Cyrus the Younger (son of Darius II of Persia) who decided to financially support the Peloponnesians. This new revenue started to attract Athenian deserters to the Spartan navy. Additionally the Spartans had replaced Mindarus with Lysander, a very capable admiral. These factors caused the rapid growth of the Peloponnesian fleet {{at the expense of the}} Athenian. In search of funds and needing to force another decisive battle, Alcibiades left Notium and sailed to help Thrasybulus in the siege of Phocaea. Alcibiades was aware the Spartan fleet was nearby, so he left nearly eighty ships to watch them under the command of his personal helmsman Antiochus, who was given express orders not to attack. Antiochus disobeyed this single order and endeavored to draw Lysander into a fight by imitating the tactics used at Cyzicus. The situation at Notium, however, was radically different from that at Cyzicus; the Athenians possessed no element of surprise, and Lysander had been <b>well</b> <b>informed</b> about their fleet by deserters. Antiochus's ship was sunk, and he was killed by a sudden Spartan attack; the remaining ships of the decoy force were then chased headlong back toward Notium, where the main Athenian force was caught unprepared by the sudden arrival of the whole Spartan fleet. In the ensuing fighting, Lysander gained an entire victory. Alcibiades soon returned and desperately tried to undo the defeat at Notium by scoring another victory, but Lysander could not be compelled to attack the fleet again.|$|E
