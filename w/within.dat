5|$|A civil airport, Białystok-Krywlany Airport, lies <b>within</b> {{the city}} limits, {{but does not}} provide {{regularly}} scheduled service. There were plans in 2011 {{to build a new}} regional airport, Białystok-Saniki Airport, that would have provided flights <b>within</b> Europe.|$|E
5|$|A {{contrasting}} analysis {{conducted by}} Rauhut and Carrano in 2016 found slightly different relationships <b>within</b> Noasauridae. The specimen CCG 20011 (an as-of-yet unnamed taxon formerly {{referred to the}} tetanuran Chuandongocoelurus), which {{was not included in}} other analyses, was found to be closer to Elaphrosaurus than Limusaurus, with the three taxa representing Elaphrosaurinae. Velocisaurus, Noasaurus and Masiakasaurus were the only taxa <b>within</b> Noasaurinae, as Laevisuchus and Deltadromeus were placed basal to the group of Noasaurinae and Elaphrosaurinae <b>within</b> Noasauridae.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} observation of 38 mockingbird nestlings and fledglings (thirty-five and three, respectively) recorded the behavioral development of young mockingbirds. Notable milestones included the eyes opening, soft vocalizations, begging, and preening began <b>within</b> {{the first six}} days of life. Variation in begging and more compact movements such as perching, fear crouching, and stretching appeared by the ninth day. Wing-flashing, bathing, flight, and leaving the nest happened <b>within</b> seventeen days (nest leaving occurred <b>within</b> 11 to 13 days). Improvements of flight, walking and self-feeding took place <b>within</b> forty days. Agonistic behavior increased during the juvenile stages, {{to the extent of}} one of two siblings living in the same area was likely killed by the other.|$|E
5|$|Acute {{side effects}} {{associated}} with brachytherapy include localised bruising, swelling, bleeding, discharge or discomfort <b>within</b> the implanted region. These usually resolve <b>within</b> {{a few days}} following completion of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Another {{analogous}} case <b>within</b> {{a single}} species has been termed Browerian mimicry (after Lincoln P. Brower and Jane Van Zandt Brower). This {{is a case of}} bipolar (only two species involved) automimicry; the model is the same species as its mimic. Equivalent to Batesian mimicry <b>within</b> {{a single species}}, it occurs when there is a palatability spectrum <b>within</b> a population of harmful prey. For example, monarch (Danaus plexippus) caterpillars feed on milkweed species of varying toxicity. Some feed on more toxic plants, and store these toxins <b>within</b> themselves. The more palatable caterpillars thus profit from the more toxic members of the same species.|$|E
5|$|Armenia {{fiercely}} contested {{the legality}} of the operation and <b>within</b> two months declared its independence and seceded from the Soviet Union. <b>Within</b> several months, the fighting between Azerbaijan and Armenia would worsen and precipitate the open-phased segment of the Nagorno-Karabakh War.|$|E

5|$|Because of a weak–moderate La Niña episode, most {{tropical}} cyclones {{that developed}} <b>within</b> the season occurred <b>within</b> the Coral Sea. The weak La Nina conditions also affected {{the amount of}} tropical cyclones {{that occurred during the}} year, with only 5 tropical cyclones occurring <b>within</b> the basin. During December 24, Tropical Cyclone Gertie moved into the basin from the Australian region, before it passed to the south of New Caledonia and weakened below tropical cyclone intensity.|$|E

5|$|Imaginative space {{also serves}} an {{important}} function <b>within</b> the poem. Part one contains a rose garden that allegorically represents potential <b>within</b> human existence. Although the garden does not exist, it {{is described in}} realistic manner and is portrayed as an imagined reality. Also, the narrator's statement that words exist in the mind allows this imagined reality to be shared between the narrator and the reader. This is then destroyed by the narrator claiming that such a place has no purpose. The garden image has other uses <b>within</b> the poem beyond creating a shared imaginative space; it serves to invoke memories <b>within</b> the poem, and it functions {{in a similar manner}} in other works by Eliot, including The Family Reunion.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} that the attribution to book three was simply incorrect, and Atalante's Ehoie came <b>within</b> the family of Athamas in books one or two.

5|$|Rescue efforts began {{immediately}} after the crash. Almost all the successful rescues of survivors occurred <b>within</b> {{half an hour of}} the impact. Initially, rescue efforts were led by the military and civilian employees <b>within</b> the building. <b>Within</b> minutes, the first fire companies arrived and found these volunteers searching near the impact site. The firemen ordered them to leave as they were not properly equipped or trained to deal with the hazards. The Arlington County Fire Department (ACFD) assumed command of the immediate rescue operation <b>within</b> 10minutes of the crash. ACFD Assistant Chief James Schwartz implemented an incident command system (ICS) to coordinate response efforts among multiple agencies. It took about an hour for the ICS structure to become fully operational. Firefighters from Fort Myer and Reagan National Airport arrived <b>within</b> minutes. Rescue and firefighting efforts were impeded by rumors of additional incoming planes. Chief Schwartz ordered two evacuations during the day in response to these rumors.|$|E
