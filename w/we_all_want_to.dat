500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Village Voice, Banksy said [...] "New York calls to graffiti writers like a dirty old lighthouse. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> prove ourselves here," [...] and that he chose it for the high foot traffic and hiding places.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Stop" [...] was shot on 27 January 1998 in Ireland, and was {{directed}} by James Byrne. About the concept, Melanie Brown commented: [...] "There wasn't a storyboard for this video—it was more trial and error. It wasn't planned {{down to the last}} detail and was quite a free-for-all. It's like everything we do—complete chaos! [...] And <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get our bit in, so the director {{has to be able to}} encompass us all, plus put his ideas on top of it, and make it all flow.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{remember}} {{the most popular}} boy in my class, who was handsome, smart and a good dancer. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> dance with him - the foxtrot, tango or a waltz. It didn't really matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here, old fellow, <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> {{give you}} {{something}} to kind of pay for what happened awhile ago, and to show how much we liked you {{for being such a}} trump. Please take it, and have a jolly good time with it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Unlike the band's {{previous}} two studio albums, Something for the Weakened does not feature any electronica elements, with Pennycook noting that his Macbook broke prior to recording, and that [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> move towards something {{which had a}} more human element to it." ...|$|R
500|$|Kierkegaard, {{speaking}} {{in the voice of}} the upbuilding discourse at the end, says they are both wrong. They're both trying to find God in a childish way. Whatever they relate to in an external way will never make them happy or give them meaning. Art, science, dogma and ethics constantly change. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be in the right and never in the wrong. Once we find what we desire we find that it wasn't what we imagined it to be. So Kierkegaard says to leave it all to God.|$|E
500|$|The {{writing of}} the album did not start until a year after La Dispute's debut album, Somewhere at the Bottom of the River Between Vega and Altair, was released. Part {{of the reason for}} the delay was the band's {{continuous}} touring and promotion of the debut across the United States and Canada, with rare tour and festival appearances in Europe and Australia. When commenting on the delay between the band's album releases, singer Jordan Dreyer said he {{and the rest of the}} band members require [...] "an absurdly long gestation period with these types of things and then we have to really sit down and be as meticulous as <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be". The band decided to use lyrical elements that they had intended to use in the first album but that were not included because they did not seem fully developed at the time. While writing La Dispute, the band had very specific goals; they projected the album to have 14 tracks and knew exactly what they wanted from each song.|$|E
500|$|The plan of a Spice Girls' reunion {{was first}} {{confirmed}} by Mel B in June 2005. She stated, [...] "We'll {{get back together}} because <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>want</b> <b>to.</b> I know everyone is up for it. There {{is going to be}} a greatest hits album and we've got loads of new songs that nobody has heard yet." [...] On 28 June 2007, the group held a press conference at The O2 Arena revealing their intention to reunite. During the conference, the group confirmed their intention to embark upon a worldwide concert tour, starting in Vancouver on 2 December 2007. [...] "I want to be a Spice Girl again. We are like sisters and we have our arguments, but by the end of the day we get back together", said Emma Bunton, while Melanie Chisholm commented that the tour [...] "will be a proper good farewell to our fans". The group's comeback single, [...] "Headlines (Friendship Never Ends)", was announced as the official Children in Need charity single for 2007, and released on radio on 23 October, whilst released digitally on 5 November and commercially on 19 November 2007.|$|E
6000|$|... '"Turn {{and turn}} about is fair play", {{as we used}} <b>to</b> say when <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> ride on Ellen Tree or wear the russet boots,' said Jo briskly; 'so you must share your girl between you, and see who will do the most for her.' ...|$|R
60|$|No one spoke. The silence {{began to}} be even a little uncomfortable. It was broken by my friend Rapley, who is in {{wholesale}} hardware and who has all the intellectual bravery that goes with it. He asked the Authority straight out the question that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> put.|$|R
6000|$|What {{the world}} at large really needs, and will one day get, is not this, but due {{recognition}} of the true value of science in education. <b>We</b> don't <b>all</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be made into first-class anatomists like Owen, still less into first-class practical surgeons, like Sir Henry Thompson. But what <b>we</b> do <b>all</b> <b>want</b> is a competent general knowledge (amongst other things) of anatomy at large, and especially of human anatomy; of physiology at large, and especially of human physiology. <b>We</b> don't <b>all</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be analytical chemists: but what <b>we</b> do <b>all</b> <b>want</b> is <b>to</b> know as much about oxygen and carbon as will enable us to understand the commonest phenomena of combustion, of chemical combination, of animal or vegetable life. <b>We</b> don't <b>all</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be zoologists, and botanists of the type who put their names after [...] "critical species:" [...] but what <b>we</b> do <b>all</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know is as much about plants and animals as will enable us to walk through life intelligently, and to understand the meaning of the things that surround us. We want, in one word, a general acquaintance with the results rather than with the methods of science.|$|R
500|$|Friction emerged at McLaren {{over the}} race weekend. Fernando Alonso {{publicly}} criticised the power unit provided by local company Honda. When being overtaken by Max Verstappen on lap 27, Alonso yelled [...] "GP2 engine, GP2!" [...] {{on the team}} radio, comparing his power unit with those of Formula One's feeder series. Alonso elaborated after the race, saying: [...] "I feel embarrassed when I'm racing sometimes because it's frustrating {{when you see the}} other cars making mistakes, going off the racing line, getting sideways. You look in the mirror on the straight to look for them and they are already side by side with you. The deficit we have on power is like another category." [...] Team CEO Ron Dennis in turn criticised Alonso for his outspoken words, saying: [...] "It doesn't show the professionalism I would like all our drivers to show." [...] Jenson Button had expounded the problems of the power unit on team radio as well, lamenting the fact that other cars had been able to pass him into 130R corner. The row in the team, which The Daily Telegraph described as being a [...] "complete meltdown", came amidst speculation about the future of both drivers. Ron Dennis admitted publicly to not having dealt with the question of Jenson Button's role in [...] earlier, following much debate over the driver's future. However, speculation ended when Button was confirmed as a McLaren driver for 2016 just five days later. After the race, Alonso had also left his future with the team open, but made it clear a day later that he intended to end his career with the team, writing: [...] "No one should have any doubt that I have three years with McLaren and my career in F1 will end with this team, hopefully winning everything." [...] About his comments on the team radio he said: [...] "We keep working hard. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> win and sometimes transmit the team radios, but it should be private chats." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{garnered}} {{a largely}} positive reception from critics. Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that the}} episode [...] "Powerfully depicts both Mulder's gnawing sense of defeat and his bond with Scully, strangely growing stronger with separation" [...] before concluding that the episode was [...] "fairly standard." [...] The site ultimately gave the episode a B. Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club positively compared and contrasted the episode to the cartoon Scooby Doo, Where Are You? writing that, [...] "I {{used to be a}} huge [...] "Scooby Doo" [...] fan. [...] Of course, none of [...] were really monsters. [...] The X-Files exploited a simple truth: <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> believe. We might be afraid of what's lurking in the dark, but isn't there always a bit of wishing inside that fear? A hope that what we think we know isn't everything there is to know. That just once it might be nice to reach for a zipper and instead find nothing but cool scales." [...] Handlen ultimately called the episode [...] "Essential." [...] Reviewer Dan Barrett from the 400 Club wrote that [...] "The X-Files is off to a stonking good start with this season 2 opening." [...] Bob Curtright, writing for the Los Angeles Daily News, called the episode [...] "an engrossing chiller about potential contact from outer space." [...] He compared the episode positively to Close Encounters of the Third Kind and noted that the episode was [...] "both scary and wondrous" [...] and [...] "offer no pat answers that might tend to blow the credibility." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five, writing that the episode was not [...] "what the fans were expecting, and its reputation isn't great. But I think this clever and claustrophobic little take, which does so much not only to refresh the show but to analyze what it's actually about, is one of the very best." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{regards to}} the {{possibility}} of a sequel, Vega has been quoted as saying: [...] "From the very, very beginning, we always talked about a prequel or a sequel to this film. And it's hard, because as of right now, <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do it, but, you know, it didn't really do as we hoped. We didn't really have a lot of support. But we're hoping that the fans will come back, and it will be an underground cult classic that will grow, and that will eventually spark us to do another." [...] Bousman also indicated interest, stating; [...] "I would love to follow up Repo and finish the story, because it was conceived as a three-part movie. But this movie is all about support from the internet, and support from fans. This is not a movie where you'll see billboards or bus stop ads or trailers on TV." [...] It was additionally expected that Hilton would return in her role as Amber Sweet. However, in a video posted on YouTube, it was revealed that they [...] "no longer control {{the answer to the question}} [...] " [...] since they no longer have ownership of the franchise, thus driving Bousman and Zdunich to make The Devil's Carnival.|$|E
5000|$|Crahay's last {{collection}} at Lanvin before {{he retired in}} 1984 won the Golden Thimble award for the season's best couture collection. The former model Jan Strimple commented: [...] "Couture clothes generally don't fit into our way of life. But these were loose and layered and not at <b>all</b> pretentious. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> have them." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was unusual}} for the woods to be so distant from the shore, and there was quite an echo from them, but when I was {{shouting}} in order to awake it, the Indian reminded me that I should scare the moose, which he was looking out for, and which <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> see.|$|R
5000|$|... “I think <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be Richard Yates,” {{his student}} Robert Lacy remembered. “I {{know for a}} fact that I did.

He was Gatsby and Nick Carraway and Dick Diver all rolled into one.|$|R

5000|$|During their 2011 summer tour Asaf Avidan & the Mojos {{had shared}} {{the stage with}} Robert Plant, Ben Harper and Lou Reed among others. In July 2011, they {{announced}} that they would take an indefinite creative break.Avidan said it was [...] "because <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> experiment with new sounds and different genres that we couldn’t really do in our band because we were about rock, blues, and folk".|$|R
