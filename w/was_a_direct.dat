This study used a quantitative approach with survey method and the technique of path analysis, where the research was conducted in early chilhood education units (Pos PAUD) at Semarang city, Central Java Province. The results showed that: (1) There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> effect of the positive nutritional knowledge of the nutritional status of early childhood, (2) There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> effect of the positive socio-economic status of the nutritional status of early childhood, (3) There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> effect of positive food pattern on nutritional status of early childhood, (4) There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> effect of positive knowledge of nutrition to food pattern, (5) There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> effect of the positive socio-economic status to food pattern, (6) There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> effect of positive knowledge of nutrition to lifestyle, (7) There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> influence positive socioeconomic against lifestyle, (8) There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> positive influence of lifestyle to food pattern.

His father became a local leader of the Conservative Party. His mother was a boyaress, and, as art collector and memoirist Krikor Zambaccian recounted, may have been a descendant of the Balotescu boyar clan. Bogdan-Pitești also had a sister, Elena Constanța Bogdan; both she and her mother reportedly survived his death.

The second figure who was seen by Vietnamese as a possible leader of an independent monarchy was Prince Cường Để.

5|$|During the 1952 presidential election, the Eisenhower {{campaign}} toured Wisconsin with McCarthy. In {{a speech}} delivered in Green Bay, Eisenhower declared {{that while he}} agreed with McCarthy's goals, he disagreed with his methods. In draft versions of his speech, Eisenhower had also included a strong defense of his mentor, George Marshall, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>direct</b> rebuke of McCarthy's frequent attacks. However, under the advice of conservative colleagues who were fearful that Eisenhower could lose Wisconsin if he alienated McCarthy supporters, he deleted this defense from later versions of his speech. The deletion was discovered by William H. Laurence, a reporter for The New York Times, and featured on its front page the next day. Eisenhower was widely criticized for giving up his personal convictions, and the incident became the low point of his campaign.|$|E

His father had served as pastor of New South Church, retiring due to poor health two years before Everett was born. He died in 1802, when Edward was eight, after which his mother moved the family to Boston. He attended local schools, and then a private school of Ezekiel Webster. During this time Ezekiel's brother Daniel sometimes taught classes; Everett and Daniel Webster would later form a close friendship.|$|E

Also, the process of rapid displacements and extinctions of species could in his opinion still be elegantly explained by a westward expansion of the Bearpaw Sea.|$|E

The band's sound and album artwork influenced a number of thrash metal bands in the 21st century, including Toxic Holocaust and Warbringer. According to Nielsen SoundScan, Megadeth has sold 9.2 million copies of its albums in the United States between 1991 and 2014.|$|E

The MiG design team had already created a version of the MiG-3 called the I-210, using a Shvetsov ASh-82 radial engine instead of the inline, liquid-cooled engine. A number of changes were made in order to accommodate the larger circumference of the radial engine, but the redesign of the engine cowling was a failure and the I-210 proved to be slower than the Yak-1 or the LaGG-3 when it first flew on 23 July 1941.|$|E
