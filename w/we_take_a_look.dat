5000|$|In {{the case}} of {{personality}} traits, non-shared environmental effects are often found to out-weigh shared environmental effects. That is, environmental effects that are typically thought to be life-shaping (such as family life) may have less of an impact than non-shared effects, which are harder to identify. One possible source of non-shared effects is the environment of pre-natal development. Random variations in the genetic program of development may be a substantial source of non-shared environment. These results suggest that [...] "nurture" [...] {{may not be the}} predominant factor in [...] "environment". Environment and our situations, do in fact impact our lives, but not {{the way in which we}} would typically react to these environmental factors. We are preset with personality traits that are the basis for how we would react to situations. An example would be how extraverted prisoners become less happy than introverted prisoners and would react to their incarceration more negatively due to their preset extraverted personality.

When fraternal twins are reared apart, they show the same similarities in behavior and response as if they have been reared together.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{important}} for students to understand the goals and the criteria for success when learning in the classroom. Often teachers will introduce learning goals to their students before a lesson, but will not do an effective job in distinguishing between the end goals and what the students will be doing to achieve those goals. [...] "When teachers start from {{what it is they}} want students to know and design their instruction backward from that goal, then instruction is far more likely to be effective". In a study done by Gray and Tall, they found that 72 students between the ages of 7 and 13 had different experiences when learning in mathematics. The study showed that higher achieving students looked over mathematical ambiguities, while the lower achieving students tended to get stuck on these misunderstandings. An example of this {{can be seen in the}} number [...] Although it is not explicitly stated, the operation between these two numbers is addition. If we look at the number , here the implied operation between [...] and [...] is multiplication. Finally if <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at the number , there is a completely different operation between the 6 and 1.

Today, {{he takes the}} viewers {{on a tour of}} World Showcase at Epcot '94.Then the announcer Marc Elliot fills us in with what else Scott is doing in this episode. So pack your bags, grab your passports and [...] "keep your arms and legs inside the sofa at all times" [...] because we're heading off on a journey to visit 11 countries in [...] "27 and a half minutes". First Scott heads to Disney-MGM-Studios to ride Star Tours. His mission: Save the universe [...] "without messing up his hair". After interviewing guests waiting in line as well as a cast member who told Scott that the first time he put on the shirt that he was wearing he felt that he [...] "looked like a parking cone", Scott goes on the ride but before the ride began Scott said [...] "May the force be with you, live long and prosper and Remember the Alamo". After the ride Scott asks some kids where the restrooms are. Scott begins his tour of World Showcase starting in Germany. Scott says that Germany [...] "makes you think of cities like Hamburg, Friedberg, Steven Spielberg, me in lederhosen". Then Scott talks to Patrick Hanfert and Katrin Schnadt two of the cast members in Germany. Then Scott gives out the first of four international questions about Germany. [...] "Lederhosen translates literally to leather pants and your question is: Do you think I should wear them more often?". Both Katrin and Patrick said [...] "No" [...] and [...] "Absolutely not". Scott asks how Germans say Mickey Mouse which leads into the next segment that deals with Mickey Mania the Magic Kingdom's then-newest parade. Then Scott travels to Japan and talks to two more cast members. He also gives the second question: [...] "Godzilla. Do you think that he should be a good running mate in 1996?". The two cast members didn't come up with an answer so Scott heads on down to Discovery Island [...] " [...] a huge island zoo and anyone can come and see it. It's a place full of wild animals and strange sounds. A place not unlike my own dressing room". After Scott disembarked the boat, Kim Murphy The Walt Disney Company's corporate V.P. for environmental policy shows Scott around the island (including the Birds of Prey show area). In a remote segment, Howie Mandel interviews guests and goes onto the Backlot Studio tour. Scott then continues the World Showcase adventure by going to Mexico. Then Scott asks the 3rd international question: [...] "With all the countries in World Showcase, {{how are we going to}} see them all before the end of the program?" [...] The correct answer was [...] "The Cool Camera Effect". Scott heads on down to Disney's Port Orleans Resort to see and interview Denny Zavett. (Later he played the kazoo) Scott goes to Innoventions to interview guests and make phone calls. The last stop of Scott's World Showcase adventure is the United Kingdom where he interviews cast members Chris Larmour and Pauline Chinnison. Then <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> at the calendar to check up on what's coming in the months ahead at Walt Disney World.|$|E
