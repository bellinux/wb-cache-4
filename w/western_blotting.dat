25|$|<b>Western</b> <b>blotting</b> is a {{fundamental}} technique of biochemistry and is therefore used by many researchers to prove different properties of proteins, based on molecular weight. Specifically, it has been employed by a research group with one publication depicting investigations of rapamycin treatment, acute myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury and myocardial necrosis among many others. For this research, <b>western</b> <b>blotting</b> analysis helped confirm effective inhibition of myocardial mTOR kinase activities by analyzing protein molecular weights versus expected values. This study's conclusion: By using the western blot technique, the researchers were able to discover that by pre-treating healthy pigs with rapamycin before acute myocardial IRI, rapamycin is associated with decreased cardiac function and higher myocardial necrosis.|$|E

40|$|A new, modular <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> (immunoblot) {{system for}} human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) antibodies (ABN WesPage; Wellcome) was compared with enzyme immunoassays (Wellcome, Behringwerke, and Abbott) and with a U.

A total of 649 serum samples from HIV patients {{at different stages of}} the disease, as well as from high-risk patients, from patients with conditions unrelated to AIDS, and from healthy blood donors, were used in the evaluation along with nine seroconversion panels. For evaluation of <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> reactivity, both Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and FDA criteria were used. With the DuPont <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> as the reference assay, the overall sensitivity and specificity of the ABN WesPage were 100 and 99. 1 %, respectively, when indeterminate results were not taken into account and when both tests were interpreted in accordance with CDC criteria. The DuPont <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> detected significantly more antibodies to pol and gag gene products than the ABN WesPage. The ABN WesPage showed a higher positive rate of detection of viral envelope band gp 160. When both <b>Western</b> <b>blots</b> were interpreted in accordance with CDC criteria, the ABN WesPage and the DuPont <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> yielded 9. 3 and 10. 4 % indeterminate results, respectively. When the DuPont <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> was interpreted in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (FDA criteria), 25. 7 % of the samples tested were regarded as indeterminate.

40|$|Tests for the {{detection}} of antibodies to Treponema pallidum are recommended for the confirmation of reactive nontreponemal test results and the accurate diagnosis of syphilis. The present-day use of <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> (immunoblot) technology for the diagnosis of retroviruses prompted the development and evaluation of a <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> assay with whole-cell T. pallidum as the antigen. The assay detected antibodies in syphilitic serum or plasma from dilutions of specimens incubated overnight with test strips. A test was considered positive when at least three of four major antigens having molecular masses of 15. 5, 17, 44. 5, and 47 kDa were detected. The <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> assay had 93. 8 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity for clinically defined samples. The <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> assay was compared with double-staining fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption [FTA-ABS (DS) ], which had a sensitivity and a specificity of 91. 7 and 92. 0 %, respectively. Dilution series studies of syphilis-positive specimens indicated that the <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> assay has an endpoint of reactivity at least 3 to 4 serial dilutions greater than that for FTA-ABS (DS). Overall, the greater than 95 % agreement between the <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> assay and FTA-ABS (DS) for clinically defined specimens indicates that the sensitivity of the <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> assay is equal to or greater than that of FTA-ABS (DS). The <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> assay demonstrated no false-positive or equivocal reactivities for nonsyphilitic specimens, including normal specimens (both plasma and serum), biological false-positives, and specimens with elevated gamma globulin or antinuclear antibody. We conclude that the high sensitivity and specificity of the T. pallidum <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> assay, together with its simplicity and objectivity, make it a good confirmatory test for syphilis...|$|R
25|$|<b>Western</b> <b>blotting</b> {{allows the}} {{detection}} of specific proteins from extracts made from cells or tissues, before or after any purification steps. Proteins are generally separated by size using gel electrophoresis before being transferred to a synthetic membrane via dry, semi-dry, or wet blotting methods.

Detection is typically performed using peroxidase linked antibodies to catalyse a chemiluminescent reaction.|$|E
25|$|If {{the protein}} has a {{distinguishing}} spectroscopic feature or an enzymatic activity, this property {{can be used}} to detect and quantify the specific protein, and thus to select the fractions of the separation, that contains the protein.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Differentiating between HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 {{infection}} {{is the first}} step to understanding HIV transmission, epidemiology and pathogenesis in geographical areas where both viruses circulate. In Cuba, positive results in mixed HIV- 1 / 2 screening assays are confirmed by HIV- 1 <b>Western</b> <b>blot.</b> Indeterminate results constitute the main limitation of this test and HIV- 2 {{infection is}} among their possible causes; hence the importance of second-stage screening and confirmatory tests for HIV- 2 infection. OBJECTIVE Investigate the contribution of HIV- 2 antibodies to negative or indeterminate HIV- 1 <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> results in serum samples from 2005 through 2008 in Cuba. METHODS HIV- 2 reactivity was studied using the ELISA DAVIH-VIH- 2 diagnostic kit (Cuba) in 1723 serum samples with negative or indeterminate results for HIV- 1 <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> from January 2005 through December 2008. Duplicate sera reactive by ELISA were confirmed by HIV- 2 <b>Western</b> <b>blot,</b> results interpreted according to WHO criteria. The epidemiological interview established by Cuba's National Program for Prevention and Control Sexually-Transmitted Diseases and HIV/AIDS was applied to HIV- 2 Western blot-positive patients. RESULTS Among all sera studied, HIV- 2 ELISA identified 12 reactive serum samples (0. 70 %) and 1711 non-reactive (99. 30 %). <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> analysis of the 12 ELISA-reactive samples confirmed two positive samples (16. 67 %), 4 negative (33. 33 %) and 6 indeterminate (50 %). Positive samples reacted against the p 16, p 26, gp 36, p 53, p 56, p 68 and gp 105 proteins. All 12 ELISA-reactive samples belonged to the HIV- 1 <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> indeterminate group. The two HIV- 2 -positive samples showed well defined reactivity to gp 160, p 53, p 55 and p 34 of HIV- 1. HIV- 1 seroconversion was observed in all 10 remaining samples during serological followup. CONCLUSIONS Two new HIV- 2 seropositive cases were diagnosed using DAVIH-VIH- 2 and HIV- 2 <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> in indeterminate HIV- 1 <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> samples. Results support the recommendation that HIV- 2 <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> be included in the diagnostic algorithm for HIV- 1 / 2 to followup negative or indeterminate HIV- 1 <b>Western</b> <b>blot</b> results...|$|R
