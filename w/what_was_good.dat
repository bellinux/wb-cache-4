25|$|Shriver was an admirable, principled, and {{conscientious}} man who {{respected the}} dignity and sanctity of human life, and he also {{happened to be a}} contemporary and in-law of Kennedy. Not only did Shriver represent a “link” with JFK, but he represented a particular culture of white ethnic Catholic Democratic politics that has been gradually disappearing for the last fifty years. A pro-life Catholic, Shriver had been {{a founding member of the}} America First Committee, and more famously he was also on the 1972 antiwar ticket with George McGovern. In short, he represented much of <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> in the Democratic Party of his time.|$|E

500|$|The PlayStation version {{received}} positive reviews. Edge {{praised the}} improved damage system {{resulting from the}} new physical modelling routines, saying the crashes are much more intense than the original. The 3D engine was described as [...] "impressive", {{but the lack of}} a link-up multiplayer mode was criticised. Ed Lomag of Computer and Video Games lauded the improved car mechanics and track design and also liked that the UK PAL version runs in full screen at a full frame rate, thus proving British developers could make decent British PlayStation games. Despite these compliments, he criticised the game's limited re-playability. The Electric Playground complimented the scenery and damage effects. Game Revolution described the Stock Car Racing as [...] "almost perfect", and the tracks as [...] "extremely cool", but criticised the steering sensitivity. Absolute PlayStation described the game as a [...] "vast improvement" [...] over the original, but said the gameplay is identical and [...] "rather shallow". IGN believed that the game compensates too much for the lack of difficulty of the first game through an overly aggressive artificial intelligence and by making it [...] "impossible" [...] {{to catch up with the}} other cars. Despite this, they praised the car physics and graphics. Jeuxvideo.com praised the playability of the game and the soundtrack, but criticised the commentary as [...] "repetitive". Gamezilla's Mark Skorupa described the graphics as [...] "top notch", but also said that it breaks <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> in the original game. Andrew Collins of the Official UK PlayStation Magazine believed the features are [...] "massively improved" [...] over the original, and said its [...] "superbly polished" [...] gameplay made it one of the best PlayStation racing games. His main criticism was that he thought the Destruction Derby Practice mode can make players complacent.|$|E

2500|$|Like Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky, Leskov saw the Gospel as {{the moral}} codex for humanity, the guiding light of its {{development}} and an ideological basis for any progress. His [...] "saintly" [...] gallery of characters propagated {{the same idea}} of [...] "multiplying <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> all over the land." [...] On the other hand, the author often used religious plots to highlight contemporary problems, often in the most frivolous manner. Some of his stories, Christian {{on the face of}} it, were, according to Viduetskaya, [...] "pagan in spirit, especially next to the ascetic Tolstoy's prose of the similar kind." [...] Intrigued by the Raskol movement with its history and current trends, Leskov never agreed with those of his collaugues (Afanasy Shchapov among them) who saw Raskol communities as a potentially revolutionary force and shared the views of Melnikov-Pechersky concerning Old Believers.|$|E
2500|$|Two other {{letters from}} Peckham, moreover, show {{that some people}} thought she urged Edward to rule harshly and {{that she could be}} a severe woman who did not take it lightly if any one crossed her. Thus he warned a convent of nuns that [...] "if they knew <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> for them," [...] they would accede to the queen's wishes and accept into their house a woman the convent had refused, but whose {{vocation}} Eleanor had decided to sponsor. Record evidence from the king's administrations shows that Hugh Despenser [...] "The Elder" [...] who agreed to allow the queen to hold one of his manors for a term of years in order to clear his debt to her, thought it well to demand official assurances from the King's Exchequer that the manor would be restored to him as soon as the queen had recovered the exact amount of the debt.|$|E
2500|$|Wilson's {{nomination}} {{sparked a}} controversy that erupted during his confirmation hearings before the Senate Armed Services Committee, {{based on his}} large stockholdings in General Motors. Reluctant to sell the stock, valued at the time at more than $2.5 million, Wilson agreed to do so under committee pressure. During the hearings, {{when asked if he}} could make a decision as Secretary of Defense that would be adverse to the interests of General Motors, Wilson answered affirmatively. But he added that he could not conceive of such a situation [...] "because for years I thought <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> for our country was good for General Motors, and vice versa". This statement has frequently been misquoted as [...] "What's good for General Motors is good for the country". Although Wilson tried for years to correct the misquote, he was reported {{at the time of his}} retirement in 1957 to have accepted the popular impression.|$|E

2500|$|Working with Bing Crosby {{proved to}} be {{problematic}} from the start. Between scenes he barely interacted with leading lady Joan Fontaine, on loan from RKO Radio Pictures, who later recalled, [...] "Crosby wasn't very courteous to me ... There was never the usual costar rapport. I was a star at that time, but he treated me like he'd never heard of me." [...] The singer tended to ignore his director as well. According to Fontaine, [...] "It wasn't that he had anything against Mr. Wilder. He just didn't {{pay much attention to}} him. He told me once that he had some trouble understanding his funny accent." [...] Worst of all, Crosby tended to alter his dialogue, saying it [...] "as he felt it at the moment," [...] and Wilder was known for insisting his lines be delivered exactly as written. [...] "Bing Crosby operated for himself, not for the group or the film," [...] Wilder recalled. [...] "He was a big star, the biggest, and he thought he knew <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> for him." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the presidential}} {{election}} that was held in 1967, the military junta, which Kỳ chaired, intended to endorse only one candidate for the presidency. Kỳ intended to run, {{but at the last}} minute changed his mind and backed Thiệu, a move he later called “the biggest mistake of my life.” Thiệu nominated Kỳ as his running mate and the two were elected with 35 {{percent of the vote in}} a rigged poll. U.S. policymakers heard rumors that the generals had agreed to subvert the constitution, and The New York Times revealed the formation of a secret military committee that would control the government after the election. What had happened was that in the negotiations within the military, Kỳ had agreed to stand aside in exchange for behind-the-scenes power through a military committee that would shape policy and control the civilian arm of the government. Kỳ flatly denied these reports to Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker, and the U.S. Embassy notified Washington that The New York Times story was baseless. However, the story was later vindicated, as intelligence sources obtained the charter that told of the functions of the secret Supreme Military Committee (SMC). Walt Rostow briefed President Johnson and concluded that the SMC was “in effect, a scheme for ‘guided democracy’ in which a half dozen generals would decide finally <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>good</b> and bad for the country.” ...|$|E

[...] Adalgisa is aghast. Norma: [...] "I beg you for his children's sake." [...] (Duet, first Norma: Deh! con te, con te li prendi, Li sostieni, li difendi / [...] "Please, take them with you, support them and protect them; I don't ask you for honour or power, let that be kept for your own children.")

(Duet, Adalgisa: Vado al campo, ed all'ingrato Tutti io reco i tuoi lamenti.) In the duet, Adalgisa agrees to go to the Roman camp and tell Pollione of Norma's grief but her hope is to persuade him to return to Norma. She then renounces Pollione: (Duet: Mira, o Norma / [...] "O Norma, look at your dear children of yours on your knees. Be moved by pity for them, even if you have no pity for yourself.") They sing together, each expressing her own thoughts and feelings until Norma realises that Adalgisa will give up Pollione and remain with her: (Cabaletta: Duet, Norma and Adalgisa: Si fino all'ore estreme, compagna tua m'avrai / [...] "Yes, you will have me as your friend until your last hour; the world is large enough to be a shelter to both of us together.") ...|$|E
