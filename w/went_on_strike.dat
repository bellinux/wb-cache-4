Workers must wait for the old collective agreement to expire before they <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>strike.</b> As collective bargaining can only be undertaken by a union, only union members can <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>strike.</b> One person cannot <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>strike,</b> only a [...] "number of employees" [...] can do so (section 81). Sympathy strikes, Strikes for political purposes, such as human rights in other countries, and General Strikes are all unlawful.|$|R

Although this was a large sum for Alaska at the time, many decided to strike for $10 or $15 a day. Van Dyke immediately hired strikebreakers from among the other native people as replacements, and the strike ended.|$|E

The general health of the population also began to significantly decline; by 1997 an estimated 25% of the population had been infected by HIV in a pandemic that was affecting most of southern Africa.|$|E

5|$|In the Boston Police Strike, Boston police {{officers}} <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>strike</b> on September 9, 1919. They sought recognition for their trade union {{and improvements in}} wages and working conditions. Police Commissioner Edwin Upton Curtis denied that {{police officers}} had any right to form a union, much less one affiliated with a larger organization like the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Attempts at reconciliation between the Commissioner and the police officers, particularly {{on the part of}} Boston's Mayor Andrew James Peters, failed.|$|E
5|$|Mill {{workers in}} England became {{increasingly}} disenchanted with improper practices by factory owners, long working hours and unsatisfactory conditions. During the early 1850s workers {{throughout the country}} began to campaign for higher wages and strikes were held in several towns and cities; brickmakers in Manchester struck in January while woollen mill operatives in the West Riding of Yorkshire <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>strike</b> two months later. Grimshaw himself {{was involved in a}} strike in Stockport, where workers were demanding a ten percent wage increase, in March 1853.|$|E

Although there was public support for the Wilkerson injunction, Harding felt it went too far, and had Daugherty and Wilkerson amend it. The injunction succeeded in ending the strike; however, tensions remained high between railroad workers and management for years.|$|E

5|$|On November24, 2004, the {{day before}} Thanksgiving, 2,000 Teamsters Union {{employees}} <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>strike,</b> after contract negotiations failed. This was the first strike {{in the history of}} the roadway. As this is usually one of the busiest traffic days in the United States, to avoid traffic jams, tolls were waived for the rest of the day. Starting on November25, turnpike management personnel collected flat-rate passenger tolls of $2 and commercial tolls of $15 from cash customers on the ticketed system, while E-ZPass customers were charged the lesser of the actual toll or the same flat rates. The strike ended after seven days when both sides reached an agreement on November30. Normal toll collection resumed December1.|$|E

Coolidge assigned 100 members of the state's Metropolitan Park Police Department to replace the striking officers, but 58 of them refused to participate and were suspended from their jobs. Despite assurances from Commissioner Curtis to Mayor Peters and Governor Coolidge, Boston had little police protection for the night of September 9. Volunteer replacements were still being organized and due to report the next morning. Many of those who provided scab labor were students at Harvard University.|$|E

Shortly {{before the beginning of}} location shooting, Hollywood union truck drivers or teamsters <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>strike</b> to protest pay cuts and overtime changes. With deadlines looming, the production searched for non-union drivers, aware that the Teamsters might retaliate by sabotaging equipment or flying airplanes above the filming to ruin audio recordings. After one of the production's camera trucks exploded in the studio parking lot, the non-union drivers headed to Yosemite National Park under cover of darkness with a police escort.|$|E
5|$|Rivadavia was {{commissioned}} into the Armada de la República Argentina on 27 August 1914 at the Charlestown Navy Yard, {{although it was}} not fully completed until December. On 23 December 1914, Rivadavia left the United States for Argentina. It arrived in its capital, Buenos Aires, on 19 February 1915. Over 47,000 people came out to see the new ship over the next three days, including the President Victorino de la Plaza. In April 1915, Rivadavia was put into the training division of the Navy, remaining there until 1917, when the navy transferred the ship into the First Division. In 1917, Rivadavia sailed to Comodoro Rivadavia when communist oil workers <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} this episode came from Mike Reiss, {{who thought it}} would be funny if the plant <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>strike.</b> The writers of the episode, Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky, would later add the dental plan aspect of the plot. In several scenes, Mr. Burns is portrayed as the Devil who is tempting Homer and showing him what he could have. During the {{production}} of this episode, an ABC camera crew was allowed into the rewrite room, which Al Jean says he regrets because they were working on stage direction, and they came off as not being very funny.|$|E

The news item reported that a portion of Kentuckians crew <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>strike</b> in protest against unsafe working conditions. The ship's master had ordered the deckhands to rig one of the cargo booms after the ship docked in Los Angeles, but they refused because the deck was slippery and therefore, in their opinion, unsafe.|$|E
5|$|After {{appearing}} in a November 2006 friendly match against Greece, Diarra was {{absent from the}} national team for nearly two years, partly due to his struggle for playing time in Lyon. As a result, he missed UEFA Euro 2008, although he {{was named to the}} competition's preliminary squad. After regaining his form at Bordeaux, Diarra began making his way back into the team and participated in seven 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying matches. He was later selected to participate in his second consecutive FIFA World Cup. France endured a disastrous campaign as the players <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>strike</b> in response to its disagreement over the expulsion of striker Nicolas Anelka from the team. In the team's final group stage match against hosts South Africa, with several veteran players missing from the squad, Diarra was rewarded with the captaincy {{for the first time in}} his international career and led the team to a 2–1 loss, which resulted in its elimination from the competition.|$|E

Horsfall and Chartist leader Ernest Jones, whose Labour Parliament Grimshaw {{was involved in}} the following year as one of the two delegates from Preston, along with Wallace Beever. The Labour Parliament was partly a response to a lock-out of around 20,000 mill workers by the employers in Preston; its aim was to organise a levy on wages to support operatives who <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>strike</b> or were locked out. Those paying the levy were to elect a committee to buy and look after land and factories and the Parliament would meet on a yearly basis. However, the plan did not gain support among all Chartists and the plans never materialised.|$|E
