It was electric. I really wanted to try my best to pull the most explosive vocals out of them. ´ It kinda carried on the next part of the story, just showing their growth and their maturity, and making it real and true to both singers.

We usually played dominoes after dinner.

'Well,' I said, 'they let you deceive me; they must be true Westerners, too, for they didn't tell me a word of your knowing.' I rather had her there, but she said: 'Oh, you goose--' We were young people in those days, and goose meant everything.
