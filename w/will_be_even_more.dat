After defeating Maze, the Hero is led into a final confrontation with Jack where his mother is killed. Jack reveals that The Sword of Aeons can only be wielded if it receives the blood of Archon. The Sword of Aeons {{is said to be a}} very powerful sword of destruction. Upon the death of their mother, the Hero and Theresa are the only two remaining descendants of Archon, and if Jack destroys them both the sword <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> powerful. After defeating Jack, the Hero must choose whether to keep the Sword of Aeons by killing his sister, or cast it away forever into a portal created by Jack of Blades' death.|$|E

The planned lease of the submarine to India was in 2008 reported to be cancelled following the incident. However, the submarine was officially inducted into the Indian Navy on 4 April 2012 as INS Chakra.|$|E

In the speech, he announced that he was [...] "prepared to give that order," [...] referring to ordering a strike on Syria. [...] Obama argued that it was necessary to intervene because the recent chemical weapons attack in Syria [...] "risks making a mockery of the global prohibition on the use of chemicals weapons" [...] and that it put U.S. regional allies that share a border with Syria in danger.

[...] When the Later Tang army commanded by Guo and Emperor Zhuangzong's son Li Jiji the Prince of Wei conquered Former Shu in 925, Gao was shocked to hear the news while he was dining, such that he dropped his chopsticks on the ground.

[...] It was said that when this news arrived at Jiangling, Gao was impressed with and became even more respectful of Liang.

40|$|During 2007 - 2009 the ADAGIO project ([URL] {{is carried}} out to {{evaluate}} regional adaptation options in agriculture in most vulnerable European regions (mediterranean, central and eastern European regions). In this context a bottom-up approach is used beside the top-down approach of using scientific studies, involving regional experts and farmers {{in the evaluation of}} potential regional vulnerabilities and adaptation options. Preliminary results of the regional studies and gathered feedback from experts and farmers show in general that (increasing) drought and heat are the main factors having impact on agricultural vulnerability not only in the Mediterranean region, but also in the Central and southern Eastern European regions. Another important aspect is that the increasing risk of pest and diseases may play a more important role for agricultural vulnerability than assumed before, however, till now this field is only rarely investigated in Europe. Although dominating risks such as increasing drought and heat are similar in most regions, the vulnerabilities in the different regions are very much influenced by characteristics of the dominating agroecosystems and prevailing socio-economic conditions.
