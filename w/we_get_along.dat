I didn't want this to be a recruitment ad or anything jingoistic. The idea of the movie is just for us to trust each other, to cross over barriers of color, sex, beliefs, whatever, and just stick together.|$|E
2500|$|Jane Asher was {{initially}} cast {{for a run}} of five episodes {{in the role of}} Anne-Marie, reportedly with the option of returning for more later in the series. [...] Coincidentally, Asher had played Luke Roberts' mother once before, in the 2001 revival of ITV soap Crossroads. Asher has commented on the co-incidence: [...] "It's the second time I've played Luke Roberts' [...] mother - the first was when we were in Crossroads together [...] <b>We</b> <b>get</b> <b>along</b> really well and are very fond of each other." [...] Series producer Diana Kyle was asked in November 2007: [...] "When you cast an actor, do you actively seek out well-known names - like Jane Asher [...] and Patsy Kensit [...] - or will a role simply go to whoever's better suited?", to which she responded: [...] "It's lovely when we have a new member of the cast come in and bring an audience with them. But we want the best actors, and the star names we cast are always the best - which is why we go for them!" ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{dinner was}} announced. Mr. Morton was honoured {{with the hand}} of Lady Augustus.

60|$|MAZZINI. But I did. I joined {{societies}} and made speeches and wrote pamphlets. That was all I could do. But, you know, though {{the people in}} the societies thought they knew more than Mangan, most of them wouldn't have joined if they had known as much. You see they had never had any money to handle or any men to manage. Every year I expected a revolution, or some frightful smash-up: it seemed impossible that we could blunder and muddle on any longer. But nothing happened, except, of course, the usual poverty and crime and drink that we are used to. Nothing ever does happen. It's amazing how well <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>along,</b> all things considered.|$|E

60|$|My Dear Hutchinson,--This is {{not going}} to be much of a letter, so don't expect what can't be had. Uncle Lloyd and Palema made a malanga[21] to go over the island to Siumu, and Talolo was anxious to go also; but how could <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>along</b> without him? Well, Misifolo, the Maypole, set off on Saturday, and walked all that day down the island to beyond Faleasiu with a letter for Iopu; and Iopu and Tali and Misifolo rose very early on the Sunday morning, and walked all that day up the island, and came by seven at night--all pretty tired, and Misifolo most of all--to Tanugamanono.[22] We at Vailima knew nothing at all about the marchings of the Saturday and Sunday, but Uncle Lloyd got his boys and things {{together}} and went to bed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Barker, [...] "don't laugh! But {{you know}} that Jack Hamlin? Well, boys, he's been {{hovering}} around us on his mustang, keeping us and that pack-mule in sight ever since we left. Sometimes he's on a side trail off to the right, sometimes off to the left, but always at the same distance. I didn't like to tell you, boys, for I thought you'd laugh at me; but I think, you know, he's taken a sort of shine to us since he dropped in last night. And I fancy, you see, he's sort of hanging round to see that <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>along</b> all right. I'd have pointed him out before only I reckoned you and Stacy would say he was making up to us for our money." ...|$|E
60|$|Fortunately, {{there was}} yet no newspaper, {{a species of}} luxury, which, like the gallows, comes in only as society {{advances}} to the corrupt condition; or which, if it happen to precede it a little, is very certain soon to conduct it there. If every institution became no more than what {{it was designed to}} be, by those who originally framed it, the state of man on earth would be very different from what it is. The unchecked means of publicity, out of all question, are indispensable to the circulation of truths; and it is equally certain that the unrestrained means of publicity are equally favourable to the circulation of lies. If we cannot get along safely without the possession of one of these advantages, neither can <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>along</b> very safely while existing under the daily, hourly, increasing influence of the other--call it what you will. If truth is all-important, in one sense, falsehood is all-important too, in a contrary sense.|$|E
