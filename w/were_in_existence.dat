The Rough Canyon and Diablo East portions of the park were given particular focus, since {{they were the only}} two that <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>existence</b> at the time. Large boat ramps were constructed at both areas, in an attempt to increase tourism.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{membership}} {{dropped to}} a low of 11,000 in 155 squadrons and the Air Cadet program underwent a transformation to reflect the changing needs of Canada and the cadets. The Air Cadet League introduced awards for proficiency and loyalty to the squadrons, summer courses were offered at RCAF stations, and a flying scholarship course was developed. To date, more than 15,000 cadets have received their private pilot licence through the scholarship course. Training shifted to be focused on the development of citizenship and an interest in aviation. Interest was renewed; by 1961, 332 squadrons <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>existence</b> and in 1972, authority was given for membership of up to 28,000 cadets.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being the}} main focus upon which Australian defence {{planning}} was based, since Federation Reserve units have primarily {{been used in the}} role of home defence and to provide a mobilisation platform during times of war. During World War I Australia's contribution to the fighting came from forces raised outside of the citizens forces that <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>existence</b> at the time, and although many citizen soldiers enlisted in these forces, the Citizens Forces units remained in Australia. With the outbreak of World War II a similar situation evolved, with the establishment of an all volunteer expeditionary force, however, with the entry of Japan into the war the threat to Australia became more direct and a number of Militia units were called upon to fight in New Guinea and other areas of the South West Pacific.|$|E

5|$|During the war, {{the only}} {{military}} formations {{larger than the}} army group were the military regions, which were defined by geographical boundaries, and the army corps, of which only four were formed and only during the Battle of Wuhan. In effect, the army group was the largest fighting unit of the National Revolutionary Army, and usually exercised command over two or more field armies or several corps, and assorted lesser units. They were roughly equivalent in size to an Army in British or American military terminology. By {{the end of the}} war with Japan, 40 army groups of China <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>existence.</b> The civil war saw three additional army groups being formed, even as they were gradually being replaced by newly formed army corps, by then a largely analogous formation. The following list provides an overview of the army groups in the National Revolutionary Army, including their organization, commanders, and important battles.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Taizu {{developed}} an effective centralized bureaucracy staffed with civilian scholar-officials and regional military governors {{and their supporters}} were replaced by centrally appointed officials. This system of civilian rule led to a greater concentration {{of power in the}} central government headed by the emperor than had been possible during the previous dynasties. In the early 11th century, there were some 30,000 men who took the prefectural exams per year (see imperial examination), which steadily increased to roughly 80,000 {{by the end of the}} century, and to 400,000 exam takers during the 13th century. Although new municipal governments were often established, the same number of prefectures and provinces <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>existence</b> as before the Song came to power. Thus although more people were taking exams, roughly the same number were being accepted into the government as in previous periods, making the civil service exams very competitive amongst aspiring students and scholars.|$|E
5|$|Göring {{appointed}} a respected and experienced pilot, Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commander) Wolfgang Falck {{to develop a}} new organisation and consequently Falck founded Nachtjagdgeschwader 1 (Night Fighter Wing 1 or NJG 1). Within a year four more Geschwader (Wings) were founded; Nachtjagdgeschwader 2 (NJG 2), NJG 3 (NJG 3), and NJG 4 (NJG 4). All of these units <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>existence</b> by April 1941. In order to improve the management of the expanding night fighter force, the Erste Nachtjagd Division (1st Night Fighter Division) was established on 17 July 1940, commanded by Oberst (Colonel) Josef Kammhuber. An aggressive commander, Kammhuber founded the Fernnachtjagd, or long-range night fighter intruder force. The nucleus of this force was derived from I./NJG 2 which would remain the only intruder unit.|$|E

The document is a list of official posts in the Roman Empire, both civil and military.

Furthermore, the lists for the two halves of the Empire are separated by as much as 30 years, corresponding to ca. 395 for the Eastern section and ca. 425 for the West.

25|$|The Springfield Indians were a minor {{professional}} {{ice hockey}} franchise, originally based in West Springfield, Massachusetts and later Springfield, Massachusetts.

The team was known as the Syracuse Warriors from 1951 to 1954; in addition, the team was named the Springfield Kings from 1967 to 1975. The Indians won seven Calder Cup championships, one while known as the Kings in 1971.|$|E
25|$|The six {{majority}} judges {{decided that}} section 41 {{was indeed a}} transitional provision, which only operated as a restraint on the first law that the Parliament of Australia passed concerning the federal franchise, the Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902. That is, section 41 only protected rights which <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>existence</b> before the Franchise Act was passed. No new rights protectable by section 41 could be acquired after that time. Because the four people in this case did not acquire their right to vote in state elections until well after 1902, section 41 did not give them a right to vote in federal elections.|$|E

The process of manufacturing gas usually produced {{a number of}} by-products that contaminated the soil and groundwater {{in and around the}} manufacturing plant, so many former town gas plants are a serious environmental concern, and cleanup and remediation costs are often high. Manufactured gas plants (MGPs) were typically sited near or adjacent to waterways that were used to transport in coal and for the discharge of wastewater contaminated with tar, ammonia and/or drip oils, as well as outright waste tars and tar-water emulsions.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1894, when his {{campaign}} reached a size {{too big to}} be directed by a few individuals, Plunkett founded the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society (IAOS), with Lord Monteagle, Thomas A. Finlay and others. Robert A Anderson acted as secretary, with AE and PJ Hannon his assistants. IAOS soon became the powerhouse of co-operation, with 33 affiliated dairy cooperative societies and cooperative banks, introducing co-operation among Irish farmers by proving the benefits obtainable through more economical and efficient management. The following year he and Russell began publishing its journal The Irish Homestead to spread information on farming. Four years later there were 243 affiliated societies. Within a decade 800 societies <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>existence,</b> with a trade turnover of three million pounds sterling.|$|E
25|$|Chairs <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>existence</b> {{since at}} least the Early Dynastic Period of Egypt. They were covered with cloth or leather, were made of carved wood, and were much lower than today’s chairs – chair seats were {{sometimes}} only 25cm high. In ancient Egypt chairs appear to have been of great richness and splendor. Fashioned of ebony and ivory, or of carved and gilded wood, they were covered with costly materials, magnificent patterns and supported upon representations of the legs of beasts or the figures of captives. Generally speaking, the higher ranked an individual was, the taller and more sumptuous was the chair he sat on and the greater the honor. On state occasions the pharaoh sat on a throne, often with a little footstool in front of it.|$|E

25|$|Although {{innovative}} {{and capable of}} good ballistic performance, the Reffye mitrailleuse failed as a tactical weapon because its basic concept and operational usage were flawed. Furthermore, only 210 Reffye mitrailleuses <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>existence</b> {{at the beginning of}} the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. Their field use was discontinued by the French Army after 1871. After the Gatling gun was replaced in service by newer recoil- or gas-operated weapons, the approach of using multiple barrels fell into disuse for many decades. However, some examples were developed during the interwar years, but only existed as prototypes, or were rarely used. The word mitrailleuse nonetheless became the generic term for a machine gun in the French language because of its early appearance in the field of weapons, although the mitrailleuse itself was manually operated.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1848 sale the {{maintenance}} of the house and gardens was neglected. Though the school tried its best it was obvious by the 1980s that a major restoration was needed. On taking over ownership of the gardens the National Trust commissioned a survey on which to base a restoration strategy. Individual trees, boundaries, buildings, lakes, paths and fences were mapped. The first principle was to keep all buildings and planted features that <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>existence</b> by the time the last plan of the garden in 1843 was created. Another was to restore the main views and axes of the garden. The process was greatly helped by the Stowe Papers, some 350,000 documents that are now {{in the collection of the}} Huntington Library, containing extensive and detailed information on the creation of both the house and gardens.|$|E
25|$|Two monastic orders {{constituted}} the clergy in Cambodia. The larger group, to {{which more than}} 90 percent of the clergy belonged, was the Mohanikay. The Thommayut order was far smaller. The Thommayut was introduced into the ruling circles of Cambodia from Thailand in 1864; it gained prestige because of its adoption by royalty and by the aristocracy, but its adherents were confined geographically to the Phnom Penh area. Among the few {{differences between the two}} orders is stricter observance by the Thommayut bhikkhus (monks) of the rules governing the clergy. In 1961 the Mohanikay had more than 52,000 ordained monks in some 2,700 wats, whereas the Thommayut order had 1,460 monks in just over 100 wats. In 1967 more than 2,800 Mohanikay wats and 320 Thommayut wats <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>existence</b> in Cambodia. After Phnom Penh, the largest number of Thommayut wats were found in Batdambang, Stoeng Treng, Prey Veng, Kampot, and Kampong Thum provinces.|$|E
