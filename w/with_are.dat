40|$|BACKGROUND: The risk of {{developing}} esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) for patients <b>with</b> Barrett's esophagus (<b>BE)</b> is approximately 0. 5 % per year. OBJECTIVE: To investigate how patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> estimate and perceive their risk {{of developing}} EAC. DESIGN: Questionnaire study. SETTING: Patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> who were undergoing surveillance endoscopy based on histologic and flow cytometric results. PATIENTS: A total of 192 patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Individual patients were asked to estimate the numerical risk to develop EAC for patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> in general and for themselves. How patients perceived their own risk was measured {{on a scale from}} "very small" to "very large. " RESULTS: At least 1 question was filled out by 169 patients (88 % response). Sixty percent of respondents underestimated the numerical risk for patients <b>with</b> <b>BE,</b> in general, to develop EAC, while even more patients (69 %) underestimated their own risk. Most respondents perceived their own risk as very small or small (63 %). LIMITATIONS: Risk estimations may depend on the response scale used. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> underestimated the numerical risk and perceived their {{risk of developing}} EAC as (very) low.

Coming out of high school, he {{was the target of}} a three-way bidding war among Nike, Reebok, and Adidas, eventually signing with Nike for approximately $90 million. His signature shoes have performed well for Nike. In 2011, Fenway Sports Group became the sole global marketer of his rights, and as part of the deal, he was granted a minority stake in the English Premier League football club Liverpool FC, who he has claimed his support for. As a result of James' endorsement money and NBA salary, he has been listed as one of the world's highest-paid athletes. In 2013, he surpassed Kobe Bryant as the highest paid basketball player in the world, with earnings of $56.5 million. In 2014, James realized a profit of more than $30 million as part of Apple's acquisition of Beats Electronics; he had originally struck a deal to get a small stake in the company at its inception in exchange for promoting its headphones. In 2015, he was ranked the sixth highest earning sportsperson, and third highest in 2016 (after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi).

40|$|BACKGROUND: GQ 1 b {{antibody}} (GQ 1 b-Ab) {{is detected}} in approximately two-thirds of sera of patients <b>with</b> Bickerstaffs encephalitis (<b>BE).</b> Whilst {{some of the}} remaining patients have antibodies to other gangliosides, many patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> are reported to be seronegative. METHODS AND RESULTS: Voltage-gated potassium channel antibody (VGKC-Ab) at high titer was detected during the diagnostic work-up of one patient <b>with</b> <b>BE.</b> Sera of an additional patient <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> and nine patients with Miller Fisher syndrome (MF) (all GQ 1 b-Ab positive) were investigated for VGKC-Ab and other anti-neuronal antibodies by radioimmunoprecipitation using 125 I-dendrotoxin-VGKC and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Two patients with MF exhibited moderate titer VGKC-Abs. Regardless of positivity for VGKC or GQ 1 b antibodies, serum IgG of all patients <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> and MF reacted with the molecular layer and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum in a distinctive pattern. CONCLUSION: Voltage-gated potassium channel antibodies might be involved in some cases of BE or MF. The common staining pattern despite different antibody results suggests {{that there might be}} other, as yet unidentified, antibodies associated <b>with</b> <b>BE</b> and MF...|$|R

25|$|Size readily distinguishes {{this species}} from most other raptors {{when it is}} seen well. Most other raptors are {{considerably}} smaller. Buteo hawks, which are perhaps most similar to the golden eagle in structure among the species outside of the “booted eagle” group, are often amongst the larger very common raptors. However, a mid-sized Buteo is dwarfed by a golden eagle, as an adult female eagle has a wingspan of about twice the width and weighs around five times more. Buteos are also usually distinctly paler below, although some species occur in “dark morphs” which can be even darker than a golden eagle. Only some Old World vultures and the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) (among the other raptorial birds this eagle co-exists <b>with)</b> <b>are</b> distinctly larger than the golden eagle, with longer, broader wings, typically held more evenly in a slower, less forceful flight and often have dramatically different color patterns. The turkey vulture (Cathartes aura) is a potential confusion species in North America from a great distance, {{as it is a}} large species that (like the golden eagle) often flies with a pronounced dihedral but is easily separated by its less controlled, forceful flying style and its smaller, thinner body, much smaller head and, at closer range, its slaty black-brown color and silvery wing secondaries. Compared to Haliaeetus eagles, the golden eagle has wings that are only somewhat more slender but are more hawk-like and lack the flat, plank-like wing positioning seen in the other genus. Large northern Haliaeetus usually have a larger bill and larger head which more distinctly protrudes than that of a golden eagle’s in flight. The tail of the golden eagle is longer on average than those of Haliaeetus eagles, appearing to be two or three times the length of the head in soaring flight as opposed to the other eagles where the head is often more than twice the length of the tail. Confusion is most likely between juvenile Haliaeetus and golden eagles since the adult golden has a more solidly golden-brown coloration and all Haliaeetus eagles have obvious distinctive plumages as adults. Haliaeetus eagles are often heavily streaked in their juvenile phase. Juvenile golden eagles can show large patches of white to the wings and tail that are quite different than the random, sometimes large and splotchy-looking distribution of white typical of juvenile Haliaeetus.|$|E

500|$|Lead is {{a highly}} {{poisonous}} metal (whether inhaled or swallowed), affecting almost every organ and system in the human body. [...] At airborne levels of 100mg/m3, it is immediately dangerous to life and health. Most ingested lead is absorbed into the bloodstream. The primary cause of its toxicity is its predilection for interfering with the proper functioning of enzymes. It does so by binding to the sulfhydryl groups found on many enzymes, or mimicking and displacing other metals which act as cofactors in many enzymatic reactions. Among the essential metals that lead interacts <b>with</b> <b>are</b> calcium, iron, and zinc. High levels of calcium and iron tend to provide some protection from lead poisoning; low levels cause increased susceptibility.|$|E
500|$|Some scholars, such as William Empson, {{maintain}} that the poem also indicates that Donne seriously believed in separate planets and planes, and also the existence {{of more than one}} Christ – a belief that Donne later abandoned. Academics also see the poem as a more general allegory of the evolution of minds from childishness, as typified by the first stanza where the lovers [...] "suck'd on country pleasures, childishly", towards a more mature form of love. Much has also been made of Donne's references to compasses and maps in the third stanza. Robert L. Sharp, writing in Modern Language Notes, argues that these references can be logically interpreted as yet another reference to love. The maps Donne would have been familiar <b>with</b> <b>are</b> not the Mercator-style maps, but instead cordiform maps, which appear {{in the shape of a}} heart. More than simply heart-shaped, cordiform maps also allow the display of multiple worlds, with opposing hemispheres – and Sharp argues that Donne's work references such a multiple world map in lines 11 to 18.|$|E

[...] While the CPC accepts that Singapore is a democracy, they view it as a guided democracy led by the PAP. Other differences are, according to the CPC, [...] "that it is not a political party based on the working class—instead it is a political party of the elite ...
