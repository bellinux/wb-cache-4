5|$|The Budapest Gambit {{has never}} been widely used as Black by the top-ten chessplayers.

60|$|It is certain, a good servant, a faithful, industrious, obliging servant, is {{a blessing}} to a tradesman, and, as <b>he</b> said, <b>is</b> an estate to his master; but the master, by laying the stress of his {{business}} upon him, divests himself of all the advantages of such a servant, and turns the blessing into a blast; for by giving up the shop as it were to him, and indulging himself in being abroad, and absent from his business, the apprentice gets the mastery of the business, the fame of the shop depends upon him, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> sets up, certainly follows him. Such a servant would, with the master's attendance too, be very helpful, and yet not be dangerous; such a servant <b>is</b> well, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> visibly an assistant to <b>the</b> master, but <b>is</b> ruinous <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> taken for <b>the</b> master.
