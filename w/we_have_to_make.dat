He wired French (16 May 1915) that he would send no more reinforcements to France until he was clear the German line could be broken, but sent two divisions at the end of May to please Joffre, not because he thought a breakthrough possible. He had wanted to conserve his New Armies to strike a knockout blow in 1916–17, but by the summer of 1915 realised that high casualties and a major commitment to France were inescapable. “Unfortunately <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> war as we must, and not as we should like” as he told the Dardanelles Committee on 20 August 1915.|$|E
