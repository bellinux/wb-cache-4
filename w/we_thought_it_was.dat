5|$|With Twitter, it wasn't {{clear what}} it was. They {{called it a}} social network, they called it microblogging, {{but it was hard}} to define, because it didn't replace anything. There was this path of {{discovery}} with something like that, where over time you figure out what it is. Twitter actually changed from what <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in the beginning, which we described as status updates and a social utility. It is that, in part, but the insight we eventually came to was Twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network.|$|E
25|$|In {{an article}} in The Globe and Mail written by Andre Picard on January 9, 1990, she is quoted as saying, “it was morbid and horrible what {{happened}} to Édouard. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> about time someone showed a little respect for his body – and his soul.” Lesperance felt the same and began plans to have the body returned to Willow Bunch {{the same year as}} his visit to the university. This first attempt failed because university officials claimed that the court would have to decide who had the right to the body. Although Lesperance gained power of attorney to act on behalf of the family, he did not proceed with any legal action at that time.|$|E

500|$|In July 2014, when Jean {{announced}} {{the title of}} the episode at the Television Critics Association summer tour, several news outlets suspected that Krusty the Clown would be killed off. Jean later told of his surprise at this theory, saying [...] "I was like, 'What? [...] "In the dumps" [...] doesn't mean you're dead. It means you're sad.' I thought it was so obvious. I would be nuts to kill Krusty. Everybody loves that character". [...] He said of the episode, [...] "It turned out bigger than <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to be. It's not going to be this blood bath where they all get murdered." ...|$|E

During the interview Pusztai said he had [...] "concerns that some of the testing techniques are not up to what <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> necessary to do, and therefore we should have more testing." [...] When asked why he felt concerned, he said [...] "it was because we had done some experiments which made us feel concerned" [...] and discussed his results in general terms.|$|E

Her performance received acclaim and the studio hoped the film would gross {{a substantial amount of}} money, yet it did not make as much money as expected. Bruce Feldman, Universal Pictures' Vice-President of Marketing said: [...] "The media labeled it as a Generation X picture, while <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a comedy with broad appeal." [...] The studio placed TV ads during programs chosen for their appeal to 12- to 34-year-olds and in interviews Stiller was careful not to mention the phrase [...] "Generation X." ...|$|E

That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something {{we were going to}} do in order to say to Andrew , 'Well, at least we gave it a try...'" [...] Jagger said, [...] "We were very pop-orientated. We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything. In some ways it's easy to write to order... Keith and I got into the groove of writing those kind of tunes; they were done in ten minutes.

500|$|The Industrial Records website {{explains}} that the musicians wanted to re-invent rock music, and that their uncensored records were about {{their relationship with the}} world. They go on to say that they wanted their music to be an awakening for listeners so that they would begin to think for themselves and question the world around them. [...] Industrial Records intended the term industrial to evoke the idea of music created for a new generation, with previous music being more agricultural: P-Orridge stated that [...] "there's an irony in the word 'industrial' because there's the music industry. And then there's the joke we often used to make in interviews about churning out our records like motorcars —that sense of industrial. And ... up till then the music had been kind of based on the blues and slavery, and <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time to update it to at least Victorian times—you know, the Industrial Revolution".|$|E
500|$|Most of the crowd, however, {{remained}} unpacified. They milled {{around the}} palace grounds with rumors abounding that the women's deputation had been duped – the queen would inevitably force the king to break any promises {{that had been}} made. Well aware of the surrounding dangers, Louis discussed the situation with his advisors. At about six o'clock in the evening, the king made a belated effort to quell {{the rising tide of}} insurrection: he announced that he would accept the August decrees and the Declaration of the Rights of Man without qualification. Adequate preparations to defend the palace were not made, however: the bulk of the royal guards, who had been deployed under arms in the main square for several hours facing a hostile crowd, was withdrawn {{to the far end of}} the park of Versailles. In the words of one of the officers: [...] "Everyone was overwhelmed with sleep and lethargy, <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> all over."

30|$|As a {{continuation}} of our studies on these systems, <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> worth taking a detailed study of the reactivity of ruthenium–arene with bidentate phosphine ligands. In this context, we have prepared several ruthenium(II) complexes with diphosphines ligands, diphenylphosphinomethane (dppm), diphenylphosphinoethane (dppe), diphenylphosphinopropane (dppp), diphenylphosphinobutane (dppb) and diphenylphosphinopentane (dpppe), and studied their catalytic activities in hydroamination of cycloolefins and alkynes. Furthermore, the crystal structure of two new complexes [Ru(cymene)Cl 2 dppm] 2 and [Ru(cymene)Cl 2 dpppe] 2, were determined by X-ray diffraction analysis.|$|R
500|$|Originally, songwriters George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam {{had written}} the song's demo for Janet Jackson, {{employed}} by A Records executive, John McClain. However, after hearing the song, Jackson's management passed on the song, feeling it was too weak in comparison to her other material. In an interview with Fred Bronson, Merrill expressed his feelings after learning of Jackson's decision. [...] "We were pretty upset because <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> perfect for her at the time. We had written it with her completely in mind." [...] During this period, Brenda Andrews, at Almo-Irving Music, Merrill and Rubicam's publisher, played the song for Gerry Griffith, the director for R music at A and Arista Records. Griffith, who was compiling material for Houston's debut at the time, felt the song perfectly matched her sound. He soon contacted Andrews and the song's two writers and implored that they should relinquish the song to him for Houston's debut album. Griffith described his discovery of the song, and what he and Clive Davis thought of it: ...|$|E
500|$|Smithers {{was partly}} {{based on how}} {{numerous}} Fox executives and staff members acted towards Barry Diller. The idea for Smithers' orientation was pitched by Sam Simon, who proposed that Smithers should be gay, but the writers should never draw {{too much attention to}} it and should try to keep it {{in the back of their}} heads. [...] Jay Kogen said [...] "Originally he was gay and black...But <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too much so we just kept him gay." [...] The script for [...] "Blood Feud" [...] originally featured Smithers saying [...] "Just leave me enough to get home to my wife and kids", but the line had to be cut for time. Smithers is voiced by Harry Shearer, who is also the voice of Mr. Burns. Shearer is often able to perform dialogue between the two characters in one take. Dan Castellaneta occasionally fills in for Shearer at table reads and voices Smithers. The name Waylon was first used in [...] "I Married Marge" [...] and comes from the puppeteer Wayland Flowers.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the decline}} of {{theories}} of sociocultural evolution, in the United States, the interactionism of the Chicago School dominated American sociology. As Anselm Strauss describes, [...] "We didn't think symbolic interaction was a perspective in sociology; <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> sociology." [...] After World War II, mainstream sociology shifted to the survey-research of Paul Lazarsfeld at Columbia University and the general theorizing of Pitirim Sorokin, followed by Talcott Parsons at Harvard University. Ultimately, [...] "the failure of the Chicago, Columbia, and Wisconsin [...] departments to produce {{a significant number of}} graduate students interested in and committed to general theory in the years 1936–45 was to the advantage of the Harvard department." [...] As Parsons began to dominate general theory, his work predominately referenced European sociology—almost entirely omitting citations of both the American tradition of sociocultural-evolution as well as pragmatism. In addition to Parsons' revision of the sociological canon (which included Marshall, Pareto, Weber and Durkheim), the lack of theoretical challenges from other departments nurtured the rise of the Parsonian structural-functionalist movement, which reached its crescendo in the 1950s, but by the 1960s was in rapid decline.|$|E

The storyline saw various character changes implemented to Becky, in real life Kelly was forced to reduce {{the length of her}} hair. This was written into scripts to fit with the adoption storyline, which saw Becky changing her wardrobe to fool social workers. Of this Kelly stated: [...] "With the adoption storyline, she borrows Claire Peacock's clothes for a while because she wants to look good for the social worker coming round. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a good opportunity for her to have a slight image change." [...] Kelly further spoke of her admiration of her characters former image adding: [...] "I love Becky with long hair and if it could have been possible I'd have kept her with long blonde hair forever but sometimes nature and practicalities take over!" ...|$|E

She won in the third-fastest winning {{time in the history}} of the race, and with the second-largest margin of victory, behind the 2013 win of Game On Dude.

500|$|... "Fishsticks" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-creator Trey Parker. The concept for [...] "Fishsticks" [...] began when Parker, fellow co-creator Matt Stone, and actor Bill Hader attended a writers' retreat in Seattle, Washington and they visited a body of water where they could watch salmon jump. They started joking about a salmon wearing an outfit like the motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel, which eventually reminded them of the music video for rapper Kanye West's song [...] "Touch the Sky", in which West himself dresses like Knievel. This led to them picturing a scene with West on a news program, angrily denying reports that he is a fish, shouting [...] "No, I am not a salmon!" [...] During a four-hour ride in a car, Stone and Parker discussed the joke further, and eventually thought of the [...] "fishsticks" [...] joke that featured prominently in the final episode. The duo said they found it hilarious and told variations of the joke back and forth to each other {{for the rest of the}} ride. Stone said, [...] "The van driver we hired was just so bummed because we just kept talking about fishsticks, 'You're a gay fish', over and over. <b>We</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> so funny, and just the fact that he didn't get it." ...|$|E

Several songs have been recorded {{with the purpose of}} a single or album release, and have not been featured on the show. For example, the song [...] "My Tidy Whities" [...] written by Tom Kenny and Andy Paley was released only for the album The Best Day Ever (2006).

Noel is also very keen to downplay the record's commercial success, saying: [...] "Just because you sell lots of records, it doesn't mean to say you're any good. Look at Phil Collins." [...] In Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop, he dismissed the album, and blamed its faults on drugs and the band's indifference during recording. He suggested that the people unsatisfied with the record simply sell it. In contrast, Noel noted that his brother [...] "thinks it fucking rocks." [...] In the same documentary, Liam defended the record, and said that [...] "at that time <b>we</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> fucking great, and I still think it's great. It just wasn't Morning Glory." [...] In 2006, Liam said of Noel, [...] "If he didn't like the record that much, he shouldn't have put the fucking record out in the first place...
