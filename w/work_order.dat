5|$|Meanwhile, the German {{conquest of}} Norway in April 1940 further eroded {{any chance of}} {{completing}} Graf Zeppelin. Now responsible for defending Norway's long coastline and numerous port facilities, the Kriegsmarine urgently needed large numbers of coastal guns and anti-aircraft batteries. During a naval conference with Hitler on 28 April 1940, Admiral Erich Raeder proposed halting all work on Graf Zeppelin, arguing that {{even if she was}} commissioned by the end of 1940, final installation of her guns would need another ten months or more (her original fire control system had been sold to the Soviet Union under an earlier trade agreement). Hitler consented to the stop <b>work</b> <b>order,</b> allowing Raeder to have Graf Zeppelins 15cm guns removed and transferred to Norway.

He served as acting managing director during World War II when Royal Doulton's managing director, retired Royal Navy officer Basil Green, returned to active service. Royal Doulton was covered by an essential <b>work</b> <b>order</b> and Smallpeice's role considered a reserved occupation, restricting him from active military service, though he was permitted to serve with the Home Guard. Basil Green's short return during the Phoney War of 1939 allowed Smallpeice {{to take up a}} position with HM Treasury, working with the Organisation and Methods Division, but Green was again recalled to active service when Germany invaded the Low Countries, with Smallpeice returning to Doulton's.|$|E

5|$|Under HCI's Integrated Programme, the Sabbatical Programme {{is offered}} whereby {{students}} from Secondary 1 to 4 go on one week sabbatical courses in each {{term in the}} first semester (Terms 1 and 2). The programme is unique in allowing {{the majority of the}} school populace to put aside formal curricular lessons for a week in pursuit of their passions or interests. Sabbaticals offered are of a wide variety, in categories as defined by the school: Arts & Aesthetics, Chinese Studies, Humanities, English & Literature, Leadership, Technology, Science and Math, Camps and Student Exchange; they are essentially courses for students to opt for, such as beginner guitar and songwriting lessons, professional music production, Model United Nations training camps, football friendlies with other schools, et cetera. Also, the school requires students to use the specifically designed Online Bidding System - the i-ComP - to organise their sabbatical plans. Students who accumulate demerit points as a result of various offences are penalised in their sabbatical bidding or are recommended for corrective <b>work</b> <b>order.</b>|$|E

40|$|One of {{the keys}} to a {{successful}} maintenance program in a large manufacturing industry is the ability to complete repairs in a timely fashion. A poor maintenance program impacts productivity, costs, customer satisfaction, and worker esteem. Since a substantial portion of maintenance labor-hours are assigned to non-routine <b>work</b> <b>orders,</b> it is important to process these orders promptly and effectively. A linear programming model has been developed to cost-effectively allocate labor crews to different prioritized <b>work</b> <b>orders.</b> The linear programming model gives consideration to different craft areas, such as electrical, mason, and so on, {{as well as to the}} prioritization of <b>work</b> <b>orders.</b> Also, the use of overtime work and the assignment of a special allocable projects crew is considered. The model formulation is continually updated and rerun as new <b>work</b> <b>orders</b> enter the system, old orders are completed, and the time horizon changes for the pending <b>work</b> <b>orders.</b> An example of the model is presented as applied to an aluminum smelting plant, where the model is being run successfully on a weekly basis. linear programming maintenance formulation...|$|R
25|$|The school {{continues}} to maintain strong discipline with a strict {{set of rules}} and regulations. Disciplinary measures {{are based on the}} Raffles Online Discipline system, introduced in 2011 and adapted from the Year 5 - 6 Section. Prior to the present system, student records were maintained based on a demerit point system, with Reformative <b>Work</b> <b>Order</b> and detention sessions for repeat offenders. These systems are primarily targeted at petty offences. Current school rules include prohibitions on eating and possessing sweetened drinks outside the canteen, physical activity in school uniform (as opposed to PE attire), and changing in class. The discipline framework is administered by the Discipline Master, in collaboration with the RIPB, for Year 1-4 students, and the Assistant Department Head (ADH) for Discipline for Year 5-6 students. For more serious offences, all male students are liable to receive corporal punishment in the form of caning if necessary.|$|E
25|$|After two wins {{from the}} opening seven matches, Curtis signed Leicester City forward Peter McKennan for Â£8,000, though he failed to have an {{immediate}} effect on the team's goalscoring problems. Brentford were able to stay afloat in mid-table due to the low number of goals conceded. The Essential <b>Work</b> <b>Order</b> made it almost impossible for the Bees to sign any player aged under 30, due to the club having spent Â£28,300 (almost double the club's net income) on six new players during the previous financial year, with only Jack Chisholm and Fred Monk aged under 30. Amidst a dire run of form in league matches {{around the turn of}} the year, Peter McKennan finally came into form and scored 9 goals in a seven-match spell, firing Brentford into the sixth round of the FA Cup for the second time in four seasons. In the midst of the run was Brentford's biggest win of the season (8â€“2 versus Bury on 19 February 1949), in which McKennan became the third (and as of the end of the 2015â€“16 season) most recent Bees player to score five goals in a Football League match. The Bury fixture also marked the first match in charge for player/manager Jackie Gibbons, having replaced Harry Curtis, who would remain with the club until the end of the season as an advisor to Gibbons. Brentford's FA Cup run ended with defeat to Leicester City in the sixth round, with the 38,678 crowd setting a new Griffin Park record which still stands as of May 2016.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked why}} he was {{compelled}} to revisit the VelÃ¡zquez so often, Bacon replied that he had nothing against popes per se, but merely sought [...] "an excuse to use these colours, and you can't give ordinary clothes that purple colour without getting {{into a sort of}} false fauve manner."

[...] Sylvester notes that Bacon was impressed by Picasso's figuration and handling of paint, especially in Picasso's 1930s works; and suggests that the white blobs around the pope's cape may be influenced by the 1913 Woman in a Slip Seated in an Armchair.|$|E
500|$|The case {{remained}} unsolved {{for over}} three years, {{partly due to the}} volume of tips received by police investigators. The biggest tip was from a Madeira Beach police bulletin describing a similar rape of a 24-year-old Canadian tourist some two weeks before the murders (See below under [...] "Witnesses"). Chandler was arrested for the murders on September 24, 1992. His handwritten directions on a brochure found in the Rogers' vehicle, and a description of his boat written by Jo Rogers on the brochure, were the primary clues that led to him being named a suspect. Local police posted images of Chandler's handwriting on the brochure on billboards in the Tampa Bay area, leading to a call from a former neighbor who provided a copy of a <b>work</b> <b>order</b> that he had written. This was the first such use of billboards by law enforcement in the U.S. and billboards became useful tools in later searches for missing people. Through handwriting analysis, the two samples were [...] matched conclusively. Another of Chandler's neighbors, and one of the secretaries on the investigative task force, thought that Chandler resembled the composite sketch of the suspect in the seemingly related rape case. A palm print from the brochure was also matched to Chandler. He had sold his boat and left town with his family soon after the billboards appeared. In 1990, when the television show Unsolved Mysteries was about to report on the deaths of the Rogers family, Chandler and his then-wife moved from their home on Dalton Avenue in Tampa to Port Orange near Daytona Beach.|$|E
