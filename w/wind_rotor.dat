50|$|A multi-bladed {{windmill}} is {{a mechanical}} device with a piston pump. Because a piston pump has a fixed stroke, the energy demand {{of this type}} of pump is proportional to pump speed only. On the other hand, the energy supply of a <b>wind</b> <b>rotor</b> is proportional to the cube of wind speed. Because of that, a <b>wind</b> <b>rotor</b> runs at over speed (more speed than needed), yielding a loss of aerodynamic efficiency.|$|E

Shearography is extensively used in production and development in aerospace, <b>wind</b> <b>rotor</b> blades, automotive, and materials research areas. Advantages of shearography are the large area testing capabilities (up to 1 m² per minute), non-contact properties, its relative insensitivity to environmental disturbances, and its good performance on honeycomb materials, which is a big challenge for traditional nondestructive testing methods.|$|E

40|$|Almost all small wind {{turbines}} have a tail vane {{to point the}} <b>wind</b> <b>rotor</b> into the wind direction. Various types of control mechanisms are used to protect the {{wind turbines}} from high-wind speeds. In this study, a generic model of a wind turbine is developed to investigate the yaw operation of small-scale horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWT) with a single tail vane. A tilt-up wind turbine is considered here {{as most of the}} other HAWT types can be simplified to a state of this model. In the tilted up wind turbines, the <b>wind</b> <b>rotor</b> is free to move around the horizontal axis as well as the vertical one. When the wind speed exceeds the rated value, the <b>wind</b> <b>rotor</b> tilts upwards, taking up a stable position with an inclination towards the direction of the wind, thus controlling the wind component responsible for power generation. This article describes the development of a mathematical model of small-scale HAWT using the D'Alembert's principle to investigate the complex behaviour of the wind turbine under transient and steady-state operating conditions. In this model, the blade element theory was adapted to predict the aerodynamic forces on the <b>wind</b> <b>rotor</b> at each rotor position. Combining the modified blade element with the momentum theories makes it possible to evaluate flow fields of induced velocities around the <b>wind</b> <b>rotor.</b> Yaw movements are modelled by considering dynamic responses of the tail vane. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate the yaw behaviour of a small wind turbine...|$|E

The back-and-forth motion of the <b>winding</b> <b>rotor</b> couples to a ratchet to wind the mainspring automatically. Self-winding watches usually can also be wound manually to keep them running when not worn or if the wearer's wrist motions are inadequate to keep the watch wound.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} a {{detailed}} study of Savonius <b>wind</b> <b>rotor</b> was investigated {{in order to obtain}} the optimal characteristics. The designed Savonius <b>wind</b> <b>rotor</b> assembly was developed on CAD software. Simulations of the interaction between the flow of air and blades were developed through finite element analysis. A result of these simulations shows the velocity distribution of the profile blades. In the same way, it was obtained the profile pressure due the velocities profiles. The formations of vortices were studied with the finality to improve the performance of the Savonius rotor. Blades with different geometry and gap distance between the blades were simulated, the results shown better geometry for the blade and gap distance between blades that improved the power coefficient (Cp) of the Savonius rotor. Simulations results show that the geometry and gap distance of the blades increases the Cp about 20 %. Through gap distance between the blades, the wind was directed to the surface of following blade to induce its rotation. An air deflector was located front the Savonius rotor to increase and guide the flow of air to the blades. The deflector increased the velocity of the Savonius rotor up to 32 %.

40|$|The {{output power}} of a wind energy {{conversion}} system (WECS) is maximized if the <b>wind</b> <b>rotor</b> is driven at an optimal rotational speed for a particular wind speed. To achieve this, a Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) controller is usually used. A successful implementation of the MPPT controller requires knowledge of the turbine dynamics and instantaneous measurements of the wind speed and rotor speed. To obtain the optimal operating point, rotor-generator characteristics should be known and these are different from one system to another. Therefore, {{there is a need}} for an efficient universal MPPT controller for WECS to operate without predetermined characteristics. MPPT control of WECSs becomes difficult due to fluctuation of wind speed and <b>wind</b> <b>rotor</b> inertia. This issue is analyzed in the paper, and an Adaptive Filter together with a Fuzzy Logic based MPPT controller suitable for small-scale WECSs is proposed. The proposed controller can be implemented without predetermined WECS characteristics...|$|E

40|$|Variable-speed, {{fixed-pitch}} {{wind turbines}} {{are required to}} optimize power output performance without the aerodynamic controls. A wind turbine generator system is operated such that the optimum points of <b>wind</b> <b>rotor</b> curve and electrical generator curve coincide. In order to obtain maximum power output of a wind turbine generator system, {{it is necessary to}} drive the wind turbine at an optimal rotor speed for a particular wind speed.
