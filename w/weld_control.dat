40|$|Through the {{two phases}} of this contract, sensors for welding {{applications}} and parameter extraction algorithms have been developed. These sensors form {{the foundation of}} a <b>weld</b> <b>control</b> system which can provide action <b>weld</b> <b>control</b> through the monitoring of the weld pool and keyhole in a VPPA welding process. Systems of this type offer the potential of quality enhancement and cost reduction (minimization of rework on faulty welds) for high-integrity welding applications. Sensors for preweld and postweld inspection, weld pool monitoring, keyhole/weld wire entry monitoring, and seam tracking were developed. Algorithms for signal extraction were also developed and analyzed to determine their application to an adaptive <b>weld</b> <b>control</b> system. The following sections discuss findings {{for each of the three}} sensors developed under this contract: (1) weld profiling sensor; (2) weld pool sensor; and (3) stereo seam tracker/keyhole imaging sensor. Hardened versions of these sensors were designed and built under this contract. A control system, described later, was developed on a multiprocessing/multitasking operating system for maximum power and flexibility.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{comparative study of}} alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) resistance spot welding (RSW) processes. Two identical weld guns were used, one with a single-phase AC {{and the other with}} a median-frequency DC (MFDC) <b>weld</b> <b>control.</b> The welders were instrumented such that the energy consumptions at both the primary and secondary side of the transformer could be calculated. A nugget growth experiment was conducted to compare the weld size and the energy consumption in the AC and MFDC welding processes. It has been found that given the same welding current, the weld sizes achieved in the AC and DC processes are different and the difference is more prominent when the welding current is low. When the welding current is high and close to the expulsion limit, the weld sizes are similar in the AC and DC processes. In general, it takes 10 % more total energy to make a same size weld in the AC process than it does in the DC process. The differences in the AC and DC welding processes are explained with a finite-element simulation model. The energy efficiencies of the AC and DC welding processes are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{problems}} of weld quality control and weld process dependability {{continue to be}} relevant issues in modern metal welding technology. These become especially important for NASA missions which may require the assembly or repair of larger orbiting platforms using automatic welding techniques. To extend present welding technologies for such applications, NASA/MSFC's Materials and Processes Lab is developing physical models of the arc welding process {{with the goal of}} providing both a basis for improved design of <b>weld</b> <b>control</b> systems, and {{a better understanding of how}} arc welding variables influence final weld properties. The physics of the plasma arc discharge is reasonably well established in terms of transport processes occurring in the arc column itself, although recourse to sophisticated numerical treatments is normally required to obtain quantitative results. Unfortunately the rigor of these numerical computations often obscures the physics of the underlying model due to its inherent complexity. In contrast, this work has focused on a relatively simple physical model of the arc discharge to describe the gross features observed in welding arcs. Emphasis was placed of deriving analytic expressions for the voltage along the arc axis as a function of known or measurable arc parameters. The model retains the essential physics for a straight polarity, diffusion dominated free burning arc in argon, with major simplifications of collisionless sheaths and simple energy balances at the electrodes...|$|E

40|$|Unlike AC {{resistance}} <b>welding</b> <b>controls</b> {{that uses}} a large (one-size fits all) SCR assembly as the power switch for controlling applied heat, DC resistance <b>welding</b> <b>controls</b> uses an elaborate inverter circuit that comes in various sizes. Because there is substantial cost differences between the various sizes of inverter circuits, there becomes a need in understanding how to correctly size an inverter for the correct application; whether one is welding aluminum or steel, with coatings or bare, in spot weld mode or seam weld mode, and more. This paper focuses on several issues starting from the weld nugget zone then back through tooling, then onto many important weld transformer considerations, then finally onto the inverter control. In the end, an effective simple to use tool for determining proper inverter size for required applications is presented. The use of resistance welding by means of direct current (DC) has always promoted cost benefits to users for improving welding quality.

40|$|Abstract In this research, {{a method}} for {{implementing}} au-tomatic seam-tracking for friction stir welding, referred to hear as WeaveTrack, is presented.

40|$|Single phase {{alternating}} current (AC) {{resistance spot welding}} (RSW) is an important method used in metalworking field {{and it has been}} used widely in industry. Nowadays there are some problems existed in the spot welding industry, which includes low welding precision, low welding quality, small welding range and low anti-disturbance capability. The problems are caused by a lot of elements, among these elements; the most important one is low precision of <b>welding</b> current <b>control.</b> So how to <b>control</b> the <b>welding</b> current accurately is the problem we need to solve. Since 8 bit microcontroller system and 32 bit microcontroller have disadvantages in designing the RSW controller. 16 bit microcontroller plus DSP is a cost-effective chip to design the RSW control platform, it can implement not only the close loop control but also the complex <b>welding</b> <b>control</b> algorithm. It satisfies the requirement to <b>control</b> output <b>welding</b> current accurately. In this thesis the hardware system based on the 16 bit digital signal controller (DSC) dsPIC 30 F 6014 is designed and implemented, the system is comprised of signal input, signal output, user interface, communication, alarm and power six module. The hardware system is a cost-effective system that can implement the close loop control with complex algorithm. The control algorithm includes the line voltage compensation and constant current control algorithm. The principle of constant current control is that measuring the current effective value in each cycle and altering the control angle next cycle according to α = f(I%) to keep the welding current percentage unchangeable. In a word. It is done by changing the control angle α (trigger time) to alter the output welding current. Line voltage compensation must be applied since line voltage fluctuation will affect the welding current. Both hardware and software system of the AC RSW controller has been implemented successfully and the results prove it is able to <b>control</b> the <b>welding</b> <b>control</b> accurately and improve the welding quality greatly by comparing with other RSW control. Moreover, it provides a reliable and feasible platform for future development...|$|R
