5|$|A {{small amount}} of {{industrial}} production involves <b>wet</b> <b>chemical</b> processes, which start with aqueous solutions of zinc salts, from which zinc carbonate or zinc hydroxide is precipitated. The solid precipitate is then calcined at temperatures around 800°C.|$|E
5|$|ZnO has wide direct {{band gap}} (3.37 eV or 375nm at room temperature). Therefore, its most common {{potential}} applications are in laser diodes and light emitting diodes (LEDs). Some optoelectronic applications of ZnO overlap with that of GaN, which has a similar bandgap (~3.4 eV at room temperature). Compared to GaN, ZnO has a larger exciton binding energy (~60 meV, 2.4 times of the room-temperature thermal energy), which results in bright room-temperature emission from ZnO. ZnO can be combined with GaN for LED-applications. For instance as transparent conducting oxide layer and ZnO nanostructures provide better light outcoupling. Other properties of ZnO favorable for electronic applications include its stability to high-energy radiation and its possibility to be patterned by <b>wet</b> <b>chemical</b> etching. Radiation resistance makes ZnO a suitable candidate for space applications. ZnO is the most promising candidate {{in the field of}} random lasers to produce an electronically pumped UV laser source.|$|E

25|$|Sodium bicarbonate, {{regular or}} {{ordinary}} used on class B and C fires, {{was the first}} of the dry chemical agents developed. In the heat of a fire, it releases a cloud of carbon dioxide that smothers the fire. That is, the gas drives oxygen away from the fire, thus stopping the chemical reaction. This agent is not generally effective on class A fires because the agent is expended and the cloud of gas dissipates quickly, and if the fuel is still sufficiently hot, the fire starts up again. While liquid and gas fires do not usually store much heat in their fuel source, solid fires do. Sodium bicarbonate was very common in commercial kitchens before the advent of <b>wet</b> <b>chemical</b> agents, but now is falling out of favor, as it is much less effective than <b>wet</b> <b>chemical</b> agents for class K fires, less effective than Purple-K for class B fires, and is ineffective on class A fires.

In some cases, thermal cycling may be an issue and selectivity to various masks may be important, so the lower temperatures and more flexible chemistry may offer benefits over prior art.|$|R

40|$|A dislocation-eliminating {{chemical}} control method for high-quality GaN nanostructures together with {{various types of}} InGaN quantum well structures are demonstrated using a chemical vapor-phase etching technique.

These structural properties derived excellent optical performance of the GaN nanostructures. The chemical vapor-phase etching method also showed possibilities of the fascinating applications for high-efficiency InGaN quantum well structures, such as InGaN quantum well layer on void embedded GaN layer, InGaN quantum well embedded GaN nanostructure, and InGaN/GaN core/shell nanostructure...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, {{we report}} a simple yet {{effective}} method to release high quality gallium nitride film from its substrate. The method utilizes nanoepitaxial lateral overgrowth (NELO) process, where GaN film is grown over nanoporous SiO 2 mask layer. After chemical {{removal of the}} SiO 2 nano-networks, the GaN with nanostrutures releases spontaneously from the bottom GaN template layer, leading to a high quality GaN film with a nanostructured surface on one side. The key factors in this method are (1) nanostructured layer materials that can be selectively removed by <b>wet</b> <b>chemicals.</b> (2) {{the interaction between the}} nanostructured SiO 2 layer and GaN nanostructures at the interface enabling the self release after chemical etching. This method offers the advantages of a low cost simple process with high etching selectivity and it produces GaN of good crystal quality. It could potentially lead to highly integrated and efficient III–V nanoelectronics, nanophotonics and power devices on silicon and mechanically flexible circuits.|$|R

The silicide layers were {{generated by a}} solid phase epitaxy process, in which Co and Ti were deposited on a thin chemical oxide on Si(100) substrates. Rapid thermal annealing (RTA) of this structure leads {{to the formation of}} epitaxial CoSi 2 with a capping layer on top. Two-step annealing in a forming ambient gas produces high quality epitaxial layers with a capping layer which can be easily removed by <b>wet</b> <b>chemicals.</b> A layer structure consisting of 30 nm SiO 2 and 300 nm Si 3 N 4, which is patterned using conventional optical lithography and dry etching, induces a stress field into the underlying layers near the patterning edges. This leads to a formation of separated CoSi 2 layers during the silicide formation caused by the anisotropic diffusion of the atoms in the stress field. Such layers show nearly uniform gaps of approximately 100 nm in width. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Interconnects are an {{important}} cost driver in advanced 3 D chip packaging. This holds for Through Silicon Vias (TSV) for chip stacking, but also for other integrated Si-technology. Especially in applications with a low number (< 100 mm- 2) of relatively large (10 - 2 - um diameter), high aspect ratio (1 : 5 - 1 : 20) vertical interconnects (TSV's), conventional wafer level plating processes are slow and become cumbersome with increasing aspect ratio, thus becoming cost ineffective. Hence, industrially feasible alternative deposition processes are of interest for advanced interconnects. LIFT is a maskless direct-write process with industrial potential. It is a single step, dry process under atmospheric (clean room) conditions. It is suitable for different types of interconnect fabrication, {{without the need for}} <b>wet</b> <b>chemicals</b> or high temperatures.
