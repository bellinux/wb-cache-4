5|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Turkey is characterised by achievements and challenges. Over the past decades access to drinking water {{has become almost}} universal and access to adequate sanitation has also increased substantially. Autonomous utilities have been created in the 16 metropolitan cities of Turkey and cost recovery has been increased, thus providing {{the basis for the}} sustainability of service provision. Intermittent supply, which was common in many cities, has become less frequent. In 2004, 61% of the wastewater collected through sewers was being treated. Remaining challenges include the need to further increase <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment,</b> to reduce the high level of non-revenue water hovering around 50% and to expand access to adequate sanitation in rural areas. The investment required to comply with EU standards in the sector, especially in <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment,</b> is estimated to be in the order of €2 billion per year, more than double the current level of investment.|$|E
5|$|A 1991 {{agreement}} between the City of Portland and the State of Oregon to dramatically reduce combined sewer overflows (CSOs) led to Portland's Big Pipe Project. The project, part of a related series of Portland CSO projects completed in late 2011 {{at a cost of}} $1.44billion, separates the city's sanitary sewer lines from storm-water inputs that sometimes overwhelmed the combined system during heavy rains. When that occurred, some of the raw sewage in the system flowed into the river instead of into the city's <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plant. The Big Pipe project and related work reduces CSO volume on the lower river by about 94percent.|$|E

5|$|About 1.2billion {{people in}} {{developing}} nations lack clean, safe water because most household and industrial wastes are dumped directly into rivers and lakes without treatment. This contributes to the rapid increase in waterborne diseases in humans. Out of India's 3119 towns and cities, just 209 have partial treatment facilities, and only 8 have full <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> facilities (WHO 1992). 114 cities dump untreated sewage and partially cremated bodies directly into the Ganges River. Downstream, the untreated water is used for drinking, bathing, and washing. This situation is typical of many rivers in India {{as well as other}} developing countries.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} piping raw sewage {{directly}} into the waterway, Portland built its first sewage treatment plant next to the lower slough in 1952. The Columbia Boulevard <b>Wastewater</b> <b>Treatment</b> Plant handled a combination of raw sewage and storm runoff that flowed into the sanitary sewer system {{from all over the}} city and piped the treated water into the Columbia River. When runoff exceeded the plant's capacity during heavy rains, sewage still entered the slough from combined sewer overflows (CSO)s at 13outfalls.|$|E
5|$|The dam catalyzed {{improved}} upstream <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> around Chongqing and its suburban areas. According to the Ministry of Environmental Protection, as of April 2007 {{more than}} 50 new plants could treat 1.84million tonnes per day, 65% {{of the total}} need. About 32 landfills were added, which could handle 7,664.5tonnes of solid waste every day. Over onebillion tons of wastewater are released annually into the river, which {{was more likely to}} be swept away before the reservoir was created. This has left the water looking stagnant, polluted and murky.|$|E

5|$|Wilsonville also {{provides}} its own {{water supply and}} <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment.</b> The wastewater system was built in 1972, while the water system was upgraded with a new treatment plant in 2002. Water is drawn from the Willamette River from the Wilsonville Water Treatment Plant built {{at a cost of}} $46 million in conjunction with the Tualatin Valley Water District. The city used to use wells to provide drinking water, but those began to run dry in the late 1990s. The plant’s initial capacity was 15 million gallons per day, but can be expanded to 120 million gallons per day. Neighboring Sherwood will begin receiving water from the plant in 2012.|$|E

Ashbridge's Bay Park North, {{to the north of the}} bay, is the site of the Ashbridge's Bay Skate Park, opened in 2009.

5|$|Another example, is the Junta Administradora del Acueducto La Sirena en el Valle del Cauca (Water Board La Sirena) in {{the southwestern}} {{outskirts}} of Cali, which manages 778 residential connections, offering continuous service to some 4,200 users. It operates a sewerage system and a <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> plant. Water consumption is metered. The average monthly tariff is US$3.5 for 28m3. There is no social stratification, but special tariffs are applied to those users who consume more than 28m3. The annual cash surplus is about US$10,000 which is reinvested in preventive maintenance {{and in some cases}} in construction works. In this way, in the last 3years a water capture facility was constructed in Quebrada Epaminondas, another one at Melendez River was improved, and a water tank with a capacity of 220m3 was constructed.|$|E

5|$|Dissolved {{oxygen in}} fresh water is {{measured}} {{to indicate the}} health {{of plant and animal}} life. It enters water through the atmosphere and from aquatic plant photosynthesis, and is affected by water pressure and temperature. Rapid decomposition of organic materials will decrease the amount of dissolved oxygen in the river, as will nutrients added to the water artificially by <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> runoff or drainage from fertilized agricultural fields. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the State of Florida recommend no less than 5mg of oxygen per liter. Several locations on the St. Johns or its tributaries reported at or below these minimums in the 1990s, including the mouth of the Wekiva River, the St. Johns at the town of Christmas, and in the early 2000s at Blue Spring and Blackwater Creek. Sustained low levels of dissolved oxygen may create algal blooms, which may also cause a further decrease in dissolved oxygen.|$|E
