40|$|Political {{and social}} {{violence}} {{has been an}} ever-present factor in Latin American and Caribbean countries. It {{is only in the}} last generation, however, that violence against women became a matter of public concern. This violence includes sexual aggression and rape, sexual harassment at <b>work,</b> <b>abuse</b> of women belonging to ethnic minorities, trafficking in women, prostitution, pornography, violence in the media, and physical, sexual and psychological abuse in the home by partners or spouses. This chapter is concerned specifically with gender violence against women by a spouse or partner in the context of domestic relations. The objective is to systemize the various actions and strategies adopted by social agents in recent decades in Latin America and the Caribbean. Of course, it is difficult to sort out a host of activities undertaken by different agents in various spheres of influence. Moreover, the need for urgent action, combined with scant resources, often hinders the process of recording and disseminating useful experiences. Section one discusses how the concept of violence has shifted from a psychopathological and individual view, to a social view of a multi-causal problem. Section two briefly summarizes the results of the main qualitative and quantitative studies conducted in th...|$|E

It is argued that there is an intrinsic connection between child sexual abuse and masculine sexuality. <b>Working</b> with <b>abused</b> children faces men with our own potentially abusive tendencies. To some extent commitment to child sexual <b>abuse</b> <b>work</b> can be understood as a response to this situation expressing, for example, reaction formations or reparative urges. Two case examples are given to demonstrate the importance of recognition of these factors and the way such recognition may contribute to therapeutic utilisation of transference and counter-transference emotions...|$|R

40|$|Service user {{involvement}} (SUI) is {{a principal}} and a guideline in social and health care and also in mental health and substance <b>abuse</b> <b>work.</b> In practice, however, there are indicators of SUI remaining rhetoric rather than reality. The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyse and describe service users' conceptions of SUI in mental health and substance <b>abuse</b> <b>work.</b> The following study question was addressed: what are service users' conceptions of service user involvement in mental health and substance <b>abuse</b> <b>work?</b> In total, 27 users of services participated in the study, and the data was gathered by means of interviews. A phenomenographic approach was applied in order to explore the qualitative variations in participants' conceptions of SUI. As a result of the data analysis, four main categories of description representing service users' conceptions of service user involvement were formed: service users have the best expertise, opinions are not heard, systems make the rules, and courage and readiness to participate. In mental health and substance <b>abuse</b> <b>work,</b> SUI is still insufficiently achieved and there are obstacles to be taken into consideration. Nurses are in a key position to promote and encourage service user involvement...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} and understand how social workers in social services <b>work</b> with <b>abused</b> women in intimate partner relationships in order to accommodate housing and how they are limited in their efforts to arrange accommodation for these women. The study is conducted through semistructured interviews and I have interviewed six social workers which belongs to four equal municipalities around middle Sweden. Each social worker <b>work</b> with <b>abused</b> women but it may differ in how they work with these women depending on the organization structure. Interest has been in describing restrictions and contradictions that the social workers encounter when providing accommodation to abused women in intimate partner relationships. The result was analyzed on the basis of previous research, Michael Lipsky ́s and Johansson Roine ́s theory of street-level bureaucrats and Svensson, Johnsson & Laanemets concept of discretion. The result shows that the social workers' scope of action is limited by various factors, for instance the organizational limitations, laws and housing shortages. ...|$|R
