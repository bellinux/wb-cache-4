Pilots must grasp distinct, real and complete information of combat situation, so that to have the initiative to the battlefield in hands. Thus, {{it is clear that the}} display of information about the battlefield {{situation is}} extremely significant. However, multi-level information contents may cause visual interference, which will result on pilots’ wrong perception about the information at digital display interface. For example, a pilot may not be able to precisely capture the target due to misunderstanding when guide probability of the acquisition missile capture in radar situation-interface and thus bungle the chance of winning a battle. European and North American National Aeronautics, and Space Administrations have conducted lots of experimental studies on improving the naturalness and effectiveness of man–machine interactions in the pilot cockpit (Mark [1]; Heather et al.

These experiments are aimed to avoid nonconforming to human cognition <b>designs</b> or even <b>wrong</b> <b>designs,</b> to relieve the pilots’ burdens and reduce the hazard ratio of flight.|$|R
40|$|In 2010 - 2012, {{scientists}} of Riga Technical University (RTU) {{have developed the}} hydrogeological model (HM) of Latvia (LAMO). LAMO represents the active groundwater zone of Latvia, as the source for providing drinking water. LAMO covers the area of 475 km 300 km and includes 27 geological layers; the plane approximation step is 500 meters. In 2013, the first practically important results have been provided by LAMO. The set of hydrogeological maps has been prepared to update the current water management plans for Latvia. For aquifers, maps of groundwater head and infiltration flow distributions have been prepared. Numerous maps for geological profiles have been obtained, {{because they are the}} most informative ones. To obtain correct maps for the profiles, it was necessary to develop a new interpolation method accounting for different comportment of the isolines within aquifers and aquitards of LAMO. Customary methods of making the isoline distributions for profiles result in <b>wrong</b> <b>designs</b> due to ignorance of this unlikeness.

It falls short of addressing the problems which most interest roboticists working in artificial intelligence. The painstaking progress and restricted performance of current mobile robots apparently necessitates such a low-level review. Overcoming such challenges and setbacks is essential if robots are to become capable of operating in more interesting regimes. Several questions are presented to help evaluate whether a robotics research program remains oriented towards meaningful long-term goals of autonomy, intelligence and capable performance. ...|$|R

In Concurrent Engineering an iterative or integrated development method is used instead. The Waterfall method moves in a linear fashion, starting with user requirements and sequentially moving forward to design and implementation, until you have a finished product. In this design system, a design team would not quickly look backward or forward from the step it is on to fix or anticipate problems. In the case that something does go <b>wrong,</b> the <b>design</b> usually must be scrapped or heavily altered. The concurrent or iterative design process encourages prompt changes of tack, so that {{all aspects of the}} life cycle of the product are taken into account, allowing for a more evolutionary approach to design.

40|$|An {{equivalent}} strain constraint can be {{used instead}} of a crack propagation constraint based {{on the value of}} the stress intensity factor, when the latter constraint is not available in a structural optimization package. The approach is demonstrated at two levels of fidelity for minimum weight design of a composite blade-stiffened panel with a crack. The low-fidelity approach utilizes a closed form solution of stress intensity factor while the high-fidelity approach computes it from the stress distribution around the crack. Results are compared with a direct approach that implements stress intensity factor as a constraint in the structural optimizations. The equivalent strain was computationally efficient, but did not converge to the optimum design when started from a very different initial design. Using the low-fidelity direct approach to obtain initial design for optimization based on the highfidelity model reduced computational cost for both direct optimization and the equivalent-strain approach, and it eliminated the problem of convergence to the <b>wrong</b> <b>design</b> for the latter approach...|$|E
