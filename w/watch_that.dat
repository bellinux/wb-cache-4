5|$|The National Hurricane Center began posting {{tropical}} cyclone watches and warnings starting at 0900 UTC on October 18, with a hurricane watch for Barbados. Three hours later, {{a tropical storm}} watch was put into effect in Trinidad and Tobago. Late on October 18, a hurricane watch was also issued for Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Lucia, and Dominica, while a tropical storm watch and a warning was extended to include Barbados and Grenada, respectively. At 2100 UTC on October 18, the tropical storm <b>watch</b> <b>that</b> was issued for Trinidad and Tobago was discontinued. Early on October 19, the hurricane watch was extended to include Martinique, Guadeloupe, Antigua, Barbuda, Montserrat, St. Kitts, Nevis, and Anguilla, as well as St. Eustatius, Saba, St. Maarten, St. Martin, and St. Barthelemy shortly thereafter. A hurricane watch in effect for St. Vincent and the Grenadines was soon downgraded to a tropical storm watch; simultaneously, the hurricane <b>watch</b> <b>that</b> was issued for Barbados was canceled. By 0900 UTC on October 19, the hurricane watches in effect for Dominica, Martinique, and Guadeloupe were all upgraded to a hurricane warning. Additionally, the tropical storm watch in Grenada was discontinued.|$|E
5|$|These early {{models were}} {{essentially}} standard pocket-watches fitted to a leather strap, {{but by the}} early 20th century, manufacturers began producing purpose-built wristwatches. The Swiss company, Dimier Fr√®res & Cie patented a wristwatch design with the now standard wire lugs in 1903. In 1904, Alberto Santos-Dumont, an early aviator, asked his friend, a French watchmaker called Louis Cartier, to design a <b>watch</b> <b>that</b> could be useful during his flights.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days before}} Katrina's {{second and third}} landfalls, the National Hurricane Center began {{predicting}} that the storm would make landfall as a major hurricane. By the next morning, on August 27, the NHC issued a hurricane <b>watch</b> <b>that</b> included the New Orleans metro area, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning by 10:00p.m. CDT that same evening. At this point, Katrina was a Category3 hurricane with 115mph (185km/h) winds and about 335miles (540km) to the south-southeast of the Mississippi River's mouth.|$|E

5|$|Ono {{was also}} an {{experimental}} filmmaker who made 16 short films between 1964 and 1972, gaining particular renown for a 1966 Fluxus film called simply No. 4, {{often referred to as}} Bottoms. The five-and-a-half-minute film consists of a series of close-ups of human buttocks walking on a treadmill. The screen is divided into four almost equal sections by the elements of the gluteal cleft and the horizontal gluteal crease. The soundtrack consists of interviews with those who are being filmed, as well as those considering joining the project. In 1996, the watch manufacturing company Swatch produced a limited edition <b>watch</b> <b>that</b> commemorated this film.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for Frances for the Leeward Islands {{during the afternoon}} of August 29, which was upgraded to a warning that night and expanded to include the islands of Anguilla, Antigua, Barbuda, Nevis, Saba, Saint Kitts, Sint Eustatius, and Sint Maarten. A hurricane watch was issued during the night of August 29 for the northern British Virgin Islands, the northern United States Virgin Islands, Culebra, and Vieques. On the morning of August 30, the hurricane watch for Vieques was downgraded to a {{tropical storm}} <b>watch.</b> <b>That</b> afternoon, hurricane watches were changed to tropical storm warnings across Puerto Rico, Culebra, Vieques, British Virgin Islands, and the northern U. S. Virgin Islands while a tropical storm watch was issued for St. Croix while all remaining hurricane watches were dropped. That night, tropical storm watches were issued for eastern portions of the northern coast of the Dominican Republic while a tropical storm warning was issued for Guadeloupe.|$|E

25|$|To Corrigan's great disappointment, Lindbergh, {{his hero}} {{and the reason}} {{he had made the}} flight, never {{acknowledged}} the accomplishment. Corrigan wrote his autobiography, That's My Story, within months of the flight; it was published for the Christmas market on 15 December 1938. He also endorsed 'wrong-way' products including a <b>watch</b> <b>that</b> ran backwards. The following year, he starred as himself in RKO Radio Pictures' The Flying Irishman (1939), a movie biography. The $75,000 he earned was the equivalent of 30 years income at his airfield jobs.|$|E

25|$|Sheepdogs are {{interesting}} enough to <b>watch</b> <b>that</b> {{they have been}} featured {{on television and in}} film. In New Zealand, A Dog's Show was a popular television show until the late 1980s, screening just before the weekend news. In the United Kingdom between 1975 and 1999, the BBC ran One Man and His Dog, which had a large urban audience. The movie Babe, about a pig who wants to herd sheep, was based on Dick King-Smith's book The Sheep Pig, about sheepdog trials in northern England.|$|E
25|$|The {{inactivity}} of the British, American and French armies, {{meant that}} the Royal Navy was free to concentrate on enemy trade. One group of British frigates, HMS Diomede under Captain Thomas Frederick and the sister 32-gun frigates - HMS Quebec under Captain Christopher Mason, and HMS Astraea under Captain Matthew Squires, was blockading the Delaware Bay. On 20 December 1782 they spotted a number of vessels {{coming out of the}} bay and chased after them. Frederick was told by the officer of <b>watch</b> <b>that</b> one of the vessels was a large frigate. This was the forty-gun South Carolina.|$|E

25|$|The Libyan Government {{rejected}} the allegations about Abu Salim. In May 2005, the Internal Security Agency {{head of the}} Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya told Human Rights <b>Watch</b> <b>that</b> the prisoners captured some guards and stole weapons from the prison cache. The prisoners and guards died as security personnel tried to restore order, and the government opened an investigation {{on the order of}} the Minister of Justice. The Libyan official stated that more than 400 prisoners escaped Abu Salim in four separate break-outs prior to and after the incident: in July 1995, December 1995, June 1996 and July 2001. Among the escapees were men who then fought with Islamist militant groups in Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} known as Arnold 36 and was, in fact, the first <b>watch</b> <b>that</b> Arnold called a chronometer, {{a term that}} subsequently came into general use and still means any highly accurate watch. The Royal Observatory, Greenwich tested Arnold 36 for thirteen months, from 1 February 1779 to 6 July 1780. The testers placed it in several positions during the trial, and even wore it and carried it around. The watch exceeded all expectations, as it demonstrated great accuracy. The timekeeping error was 2 minutes 32.2 seconds, but the error in the last nine months amounted to just one minute. The greatest error in any 24 hours was only four seconds, or one nautical mile of longitude at the equator.|$|E
25|$|Rolex {{produced}} specific models {{suitable for}} the extremes of deep-sea diving, caving, mountain climbing, polar exploration, and aviation. Early sports models included the Rolex Submariner (1953) and the Rolex Oyster Perpetual Date Sea Dweller. The latter watch has a helium release valve, co-invented with Swiss watchmaker Doxa, to release helium gas build-up during decompression. The Explorer (1953) and Explorer II (1971) were developed specifically for explorers who would navigate rough terrain, such as the world-famous Mount Everest expeditions. Another iconic model is the Rolex GMT Master (1954), originally developed {{at the request of}} Pan Am Airways to provide its crews with a dual time <b>watch</b> <b>that</b> could be used to display GMT (Greenwich Mean Time), which was the international time standard for aviation at that time and was needed for Astronavigation during longer flights.|$|E
