25|$|Given {{that water}} {{contamination}} {{is a major}} means of transmitting diarrheal disease, efforts to provide clean water supply and improved sanitation {{have the potential to}} dramatically cut the rate of disease incidence. In fact, it has been proposed that <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> an 88% reduction in child mortality resulting from diarrheal disease as a result of improved water sanitation and hygiene. Similarly, a meta-analysis of numerous studies on improving water supply and sanitation shows a 22–27% reduction in disease incidence, and a 21–30% reduction in mortality rate associated with diarrheal disease.|$|E
25|$|There {{exists a}} class of 'radiatively inefficient' {{solutions}} to the equations that govern accretion. The most widely known {{of these is the}} Advection Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF), but other theories exist. In this type of accretion, which is important for accretion rates well below the Eddington limit, the accreting matter does not form a thin disc and consequently does not efficiently radiate away the energy that it acquired as it moved close to the black hole. Radiatively inefficient accretion has been used to explain the lack of strong AGN-type radiation from massive black holes at the centres of elliptical galaxies in clusters, where otherwise <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> high accretion rates and correspondingly high luminosities. Radiatively inefficient AGN would be expected to lack many of the characteristic features of standard AGN with an accretion disc.|$|E
500|$|That basic {{scaffolding}} remains {{when one}} {{moves to a}} quantum description but some conceptual changes are needed. One is that whereas <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> in our everyday life {{that there would be}} some constraints on the points to which a particle can move, that is not true in full quantum electrodynamics. There is a possibility of an electron at A, or a photon at B, moving as a basic action to any other place and time in the universe. That includes places that could only be reached at speeds greater than that of light and also earlier times. (An electron moving backwards in time {{can be viewed as a}} positron moving forward in time.) ...|$|E

500|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{highlighted}} {{the scene in}} which Tintin was imprisoned in the Marlinspike crypt, observing that it had parallels with Tintin's exploration of tombs and other secret chambers throughout the series. He identified the mystery left in Francis Haddock's parchments to be another appearance of Tintin's adventures being [...] "framed by enigmas". To this he adds that in solving the enigma, Tintin shows that he is [...] "the best reader" [...] in the series, {{and it is this}} which establishes him as [...] "the oeuvre's hero". McCarthy praised Hergé's Silk as one of the pivotal characters in the series who can [...] "exude a presence far beyond that which <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> from a novelist, let alone a cartoonist".|$|E
500|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{praised the}} {{character}} of Tarragon, stating that he exudes a presence [...] "far beyond what <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> from a novelist, let alone a cartoonist". He then compared the scenario in which Tarragon was trapped within his home to that in The Calculus Affair in which Professor Topolino was tied up in his house. He also identified elements within the story that he believed reflected recurring themes within The Adventures of Tintin. He argued that {{the way in which}} Alcazar was presented as Tintin's friend in this story was a manifestation of the recurring theme of friendship. He thought that the appearance of Rascar Capac's jewels reflected Hergé's use of jewels as a theme throughout the series, while the mummy's removal from its tomb was a manifestation of the recurring concept of the tomb.|$|E

[...] Feminist academic and AIDS video producer Alexandra Juhasz puts forth the film as [...] "an effective critique of the silly sensationalism used in much reportage of AIDS science [...] fights melodrama and tabloid journalism -- with melodrama and tabloid journalism." [...] Not all such critical commentary has been positive, with openly gay film scholar Robin Wood (who saw the film when someone very close to him was {{in the final stages of}} AIDS) calling the film [...] "misguided on the levels both of conception and execution." ...|$|E

40|$|Many of the {{expectations}} and aspirations about the ‘difference’ that women judges would make have proved unrealistic, given the inevitable diversity and often conservatism of women appointed as judges.

This essay focuses on feminist judges, {{and seeks to}} identify {{what it is that}} <b>we</b> <b>might</b> reasonably <b>expect</b> of them. This in turn requires consideration of who counts as a feminist judge, what might be included in a feminist approach to judging, and what institutional norms inherent within the judicial role might constrain the adoption of a feminist approach. The essay concludes that feminist judges both can and ought to make a difference across a wide range of judicial activities...|$|R

40|$|It is {{probably}} {{fair to say}} that small mobile computing devices, such as personal digital assistants (PDAs), have been slow to claim the large market share that was predicted in the late 1980 s. The reasons behind the slow consumer uptake are not clear. What is clear is that the latest generation of consumers have been more than willing to embrace mobile phones, portable music players, and hand-held gaming devices. It is also becoming clear that these stand-alone applications of mobile technology have been converging. For example, <b>we</b> now <b>might</b> <b>expect</b> our mobile phones to play music and provide games, video, and picture-taking facilities. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> also <b>expect</b> seamless access to wireless Internet and the required functionality for both e-mail and web browsing.
