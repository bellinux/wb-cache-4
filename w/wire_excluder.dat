30|$|It is {{well known}} that one of the main {{drawbacks}} of the standard intramedullary osteosynthesis is the risk of damaging the medullary canal content, mainly its vessels [19]. It results in a weaker ability of pluripotent bone marrow stromal cells to osteogenesis and osteoinduction. As a matter of fact, the introduction of intramedullary <b>wires</b> almost <b>excludes</b> the damage to the intraosseous artery or injury to the endosteum as far as the wires we use have a bunt end, are of a small diameter (1.8 – 2.0  mm) and occupy not more than 30 % of the canine bone marrow canal. In humans, they take a far more less space as even the narrowest part of the canal is wider. We did not have any arterial damage in our clinical practice [7, 8].|$|R
30|$|Mechanically {{ventilated}} patients undergoing PDT {{with the}} Ciaglia single-step dilator technique (Ciaglia Blue Rhino® G 2, Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA) were enrolled. Tracheal cannulation and insertion of the dilator during PDT were visually guided by bronchoscopy (Olympus BF-P 60, Olympus Medical Systems Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Patients with hemodynamic instability, significant pulmonary morbidity defined as COPD GOLD 2 or greater, asthma bronchiale or known {{interstitial lung disease}} and metallic foreign bodies such as implantable electronic cardiac devices and sternal <b>wires</b> were <b>excluded.</b> A 16 -electrode EIT monitoring belt (PulmoVista 500 ™ EIT belt, Drägerwerk, Lübeck, Germany) was attached at a level above the intermammillary line and connected to a portable EIT monitor (PulmoVista 500 ™, Drägerwerk, Lübeck, Germany). The size of the EIT belt was chosen according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.|$|R
40|$|Combining {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} (PET) and MRI necessarily involves an engineering tradeoff as the equipment needed for the two modalities vies for the space closest to the region where the signals originate. In one recently described scanner configuration for simultaneous {{positron emission tomography}}–MRI, the positron emission tomography detection scintillating crystals reside in an 80 -mm gap between the 2 halves of a 1 -T split-magnet cryostat. A novel set of gradient and shim coils has been specially designed for this split MRI scanner to include an 110 -mm gap from which <b>wires</b> are <b>excluded</b> {{so as not to}} interfere with positron detection. An inverse boundary element method was necessarily employed to design the three orthogonal, shielded gradient coils and shielded Z 0 shim coil. The coils have been constructed and tested in the hybrid positron emission tomography-MRI system and successfully used in simultaneous positron emission tomography-MRI experiments.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a case study}} of corrosion of post-tensioning strands in segregated grout that led to failure of one of the external tendons of a bridge after less than two years from the construction. Unexpectedly, severe corrosion attacks took place in areas where the ducts were filled by the injection grout, but segregation of the grout led to the presence of an unhardened whitish paste. A detailed inspection of the failed tendon, as well as other tendons removed afterwards, showed that corrosion occurred mainly in the inclined parts of the external post-tensioning tendons, in presence of whitish grout. Analysis on samples of segregated grout showed that it was highly alkaline and had a high content of sulphate ions, but was free of chloride ions, excluding thus the normal causes of corrosion of steel in cement-based materials. Microstructural analysis of failed <b>wires</b> also <b>excluded</b> the failure for hydrogen embrittlement...|$|R
40|$|The {{transmission}} of multimedia data over networks has increased steadily {{over the past}} few years and this increase is projected to accelerate in the future. However, virtually all current products and research for multimedia traffic over networks have concentrated solely on {{transmission of}} multimedia applications to and from <b>wired</b> terminals. <b>Excluding</b> mobile terminals from multimedia applications such as voice clearly limits the flexibility and potential of those applications. Additionally, the bandwidth allocated for wireless LANs in the IEEE 802. 11 standard is limited and overall throughput is limited, and these limitations will become a bottleneck for expanding wireless network capabilities. In this paper, we exploit another resource, i. e., space, and design a new Smart Wireless LAN (SWL) protocol to achieve throughput multiplication and flexibility for mixed traffic networks. Experimental studies and computer simulations will show the feasibility and performance benefits for using SWL with wireless LANs, particularly for multimedia applications. 1...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{investigate}} the possibilities of hybrid laser arc welding regarding reliable production of longitudinal welds of high strength pipe steels X 80 and X 120 and to evaluate achievable mechanical properties of laser hybrid welds. The study focused on weld toughness examination in low temperature range up to 260 uC. Suitable filler materials were identified {{in the context of this}} task. It could be shown that metal cored electrodes guaranteed sufficient Charpy impact toughness at low temperature for both investigated materials. Modern arc welding technologies such as modified pulsed spray arc were used to promote deeper penetration of the filler material into the narrow laser welding gap. Edge preparation with a 14 mm deep root face was considered as optimum, because no penetration of the filler material could be detected beyond this depth limit, and therefore, any metallurgical influences on the weld metal properties through the welding <b>wire</b> could be <b>excluded...</b>|$|R
40|$|Publicación ISIThe {{landscape}} (matrix) surrounding habitat fragments critically {{affects the}} biodiversity of those fragments due to biotic interchange and physical effects. However, to date, {{there have been}} {{only a limited number of}} studies on plant-animal interactions in fragmented landscapes, particularly on how tree seedling herbivory is affected by fragmentation. We have examined this question in a fog-dependent mosaic of rainforest fragments located on coastal mountaintops of semiarid Chile (30 degrees S), where the effects of the surrounding semiarid matrix and forest patch size (0. 1 - 22 ha) on tree seedling survival were simultaneously addressed. The rainforest is strongly dominated by the endemic evergreen tree species Aextoxicon punctatum (Olivillo, approx. 80 % of basal area). To assess the magnitudes and causes of Olivillo seedling mortality, we set up a field experiment where 512 tree seedlings of known age were transplanted into four forest fragments of different sizes in four 1. 5 x 3 -m plots per patch; one-half of each plot was fenced off with chicken <b>wire</b> to <b>exclude</b> small mammals. The plots were monitored for 22 months. Overall, 50 % of the plants died during the experiment. The exclusion of small mammals from the plots increased seedling survival by 25 %, with the effect being greater in smaller patches where matrix-dwelling herbivores are more abundant. This experiment highlights the important role of the surrounding matrix in affecting the persistence of trees in forest fragments. Because herbivores from the matrix cause greater tree seedling mortality in small patches, their effects must be taken into account in forest conservation-restoration plans...|$|R
40|$|The bunya pine (A. bidwillii) has a {{very limited}} {{distribution}} within Australia. Part {{of the reason for}} this is likely to be its poor seed dispersal. Macropods, possums and rodents are known predators of both the seeds and tubers. However, there are no reported dispersal agents for A. bidwillii seeds. The aim of this research is to determine the extent to which A. bidwillii seeds are destroyed or dispersed by native rodents. Predation and dispersal of A. bidwilli seeds are being examined in southern Queensland in a small stand of A. bidwilli at Mt Mee, and in a larger stand at the Bunya Mountains and in northern New South wales in a similar habitat devoid of A. bidwilli near Queen Mary Falls. At each site, groups of 100 seeds are placed on the soil; 25 seeds are covered by <b>wire</b> mesh to <b>exclude</b> predators and 75 are left uncovered. Each seed is marked by a pink tag to assist in locating it and tracking its movement. Activity of rodents is monitored using CCD cameras connected to video-recorders. Hair tubes are also utilized for identification of rodents. Preliminary results indicate that a small but significant amount of seeds are eaten. However, enough seeds escape predation to produce seedlings. Germination is rapid under field conditions. Seeds were dispersed more than 16 m from their original locations, permitting some to germinate in open sites away from the bunya pine canopy, where they are more likely to survive...|$|R
40|$|Proper thermal {{management}} {{is important for}} optimum performance and durability of most electric-vehicle batteries. For high-temperature cells such as sodium/sulphur, a very efficient and responsive thermal control system is essential. Heat must be removed during exothermic periods and retained when the batteries are not in use. Current {{thermal management}} approaches rely on passive insulation enclosures with active cooling loops that penetrate the enclosure. This paper presents the design, analysis, and testing of an enclosure with variable conductance insulation (VCI). VCI uses a hydride with an integral electric resistance heater to expel and retrieve {{a small amount of}} hydrogen gas into a vacuum space. By controlling the amount of hydrogen gas, the thermal conductance can be varied by more than 100 : 1, enabling the cooling loop (cold plate) to be mounted on the enclosure exterior. By not penetrating the battery enclosure, the cooling system is simpler and more reliable. Also, heat can be retained more effectively when desired. For high temperatures, radiation shields within the vacuum space are required. Ceramic spacers are used to maintain separation of the steel enclosure materials against atmospheric loading. Ceramic-to-ceramic thermal contact resistance within the spacer assembly minimizes thermal conductance. Two full-scale (0. 8 -m {times} 0. 9 -m {times} 0. 3 -m) prototypes were designed, built, and tested under high-temperature 200 {degrees}- 350 {degrees}C battery conditions. With an internal temperature of 330 {degrees}C (and 20 {degrees}C ambient), the measured total-enclosure minimum heat loss was 80 watts (<b>excluding</b> <b>wire</b> pass-through losses). The maximum heat rejection was 4100 watts. The insulation can be switched from minimum to maximum conductance (hydrogen pressure from 2. 0 {times} 10 {sup - 3 } to 8 torr) in 3 minutes. Switching from maximum to minimum conductance was longer (16 minutes), but still satisfactory because of the large thermal mass of the battery...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} research, {{carried out}} at Creswell Crags, Derbyshire, was to {{investigate}} the decomposition of small mammal remains in temperate caves, with particular regard to the impact upon the cavernicolous invertebrate community and the cave sediments. The carcasses of laboratory rats were deposited in the threshold, deep threshold and hypogean regions of two caves, on sediments of differing depths layered with markers to assess the extent of bioturbation. Carcasses were covered by <b>wire</b> mesh to <b>exclude</b> vertebrate scavengers. The physical condition of the carcasses, the succession of the carrion community and the diversity of the cavernicolous invertebrates were monitored for a minimum of one year. To investigate the effect of season on decomposition, experiments were begun in both summer and winter. The processes of decomposition observed in this investigation differed considerably from those reported by other authors working on carrion deposited above ground or buried. This is especially true of the rate of carrion consumption by invertebrates which is strongly influenced by abiotic conditions. In the caves, carcasses persisted for much longer than on the surface. Carcasses in the threshold region were rapidly colonised by necrophagous Diptera, whilst the decomposition of those farther underground was initially microbial. The diversity and evenness of the invertebrate community in the threshold region were disrupted by the influx of non-cavernicolous species. In the hypogean region, the over-representation of certain troglophilic species changed the structure of the invertebrate community. These results have been incorporated into a descriptive model, which proposes decomposition pathways for small mammal carrion deposited in the threshold, deep threshold and hypogean region of shallow temperate caves. The activity of arthropods, particulary dipterous larvae, was found to disrupt the sediment beneath carrion to a depth of at least 10 cm, which has implications for cave sediment stratigraphy. A laboratory population of the staphylinid cave beetle Quedius mesomelinus was established to examine its life history and behaviour. It was concluded that the species shows a number of adaptations to cavernicolous life, including a K-selected reproductive strategy...|$|R
40|$|Summary]: The {{modification}} of natural woodlands through tree removal or clearing {{and a history}} of livestock grazing are likely to be important factors affecting biodiversity. These variegated landscapes are found in many eastern states where both livestock grazing and tree removal represent significant anthropogenic disturbances on natural woodlands. An understanding of the effects of vegetation management and sheep grazing on a number of components of biodiversity is important to ensure more sustainable management of land units in any region. The broad aim of this research project was to determine if vegetation management and grazing has an effect on arthropod assemblages in the Traprock wool-producing region of southern Queensland. Eighteen study sites were established across the study area according to vegetation type (ironbark/gum woodland and box woodland), and density of mature trees (low [20 trees/ha]), in areas where there was an absence of woody regrowth in the understorey. Sample sites were established randomly within patches and three ‘treatments’ were set up using 6 m x 6 m exclosures: complete grazing exclosure (2 m fully meshed fencing to exclude all vertebrate herbivores); partial exclosure (1 m three <b>wire</b> fencing to <b>exclude</b> sheep but allow access for native herbivores such as wallabies and kangaroos) and unexclosed (unfenced plot marked with corner pegs). Three to four pitfall traps (9 cm deep 11 cm diameter, plastic food containers) were placed in each exclosure over a period of 3 days in April 2005 and opened at the same time for a period of 6 days. All arthropods were identified to order level, except for Formicidae, which were initially taken no further than family level and collembola and myriapods, which were only identified to the level of class. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for differences in arthropod abundance and taxon richness. Two diversity indices were calculated for the order level data: Simpson and Margalef. Patterns in arthropod abundance were examined using multidimensional scaling (MDS) and analysis of similarity (ANOSIM). Tree density was found to have a significant impact upon the abundance, richness and diversity of arthropods collected in pitfall traps in the Traprock region of southern Queensland. Arthropod abundance was found to be significantly greater in low tree density sites than in medium or high tree density sites. Arthropod richness (at the taxonomic level of order) and diversity were found to be significantly greater in medium and high tree density sites compared to low tree density areas, although no significant difference was found for abundance, richness or diversity between medium and high tree density sites. Vegetation type and landscape position was found to have little effect upon arthropod abundance, richness and diversity, although this may have been be a function of the coarse taxonomic resolution employed rather than a lack of assemblage distinction between the sites. These and other findings are discussed in relation to ecological theory, management recommendations and the practicalities of using arthropods as barometers indicators of system change and condition. ...|$|R
