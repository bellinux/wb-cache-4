5|$|Bolton were relegated on goal {{difference}} {{at the end}} of the 1997–98 Premiership campaign. They finished on the same number of points as Everton, whom they faced in the first competitive match at the newly built Reebok Stadium. The game finished 0–0, but a goal by Gerry Taggart for the Whites was mistakenly not given; the point swing in Bolton's favour <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> them up. The following season they reached the 1999 Division One play-off Final but lost 2–0 to Watford.|$|E
5|$|Ostfriesland was ceded to the US Navy, and {{was later}} used as a {{stationary}} target during a demonstration of air power, conducted by General Billy Mitchell on 21 July 1921 off Cape Henry in Virginia. The ship sank at 12:40 after sustaining several bomb hits and near misses. However, she likely would have avoided these had she been underway, and {{if she had been}} hit, damage control teams <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> the ship afloat.|$|E

5|$|He {{made his}} Premier League debut against West Ham United in August 2009 and played {{regularly}} during the 2009–10 season, scoring {{three times to}} help them achieve top flight survival. In September 2010, he signed a new contract which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> him at the club until the summer of 2015, and was once again a regular in the Wolves team during the 2010–11 season, scoring four Premier League goals, his highest tally for four seasons. On 19 May 2011, Jarvis was awarded both Supporters' Player of the Season award and Players' Player of the season awards.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 Giro {{featured}} {{an assortment}} of contenders for the overall victory. Defending champion Danilo Di Luca had faced potential bans which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> {{him out of the}} race, after investigations into his involvement with the Oil for Drugs scandal and an irregular doping test given after stage 17 of the 2007 Giro d'Italia, either of which could have resulted in a two-year suspension. Though he was suspended for three months because of Oil for Drugs, he was cleared by the Italian National Olympic Committee of any wrongdoing in the 2007 Giro, and was thus permitted to start.|$|E
5|$|The report {{suggests}} two hypotheses for the accident. In the first, {{there was}} a flaw in the power control of the plane's engines, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> one of the thrust levers into acceleration, regardless of their actual position. In such circumstances, there was mechanical failure of the aircraft. However, the occurrence of this failure is one in 400 billion hours of flight and therefore highly improbable. In the second hypothesis, the pilot has performed a procedure different from that provided in the manual, and put the thrust lever in an irregular position, a configuration of human error for the accident.|$|E

5|$|The system {{inverters}} typically provide {{power output}} at voltages {{of the order}} of 480 VAC. Electricity grids operate at much higher voltages {{of the order of}} tens or hundreds of thousands of volts, so transformers are incorporated to deliver the required output to the grid. Due to the long lead time, the Long Island Solar Farm chose to keep a spare transformer onsite, as transformer failure <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> the solar farm offline for a long period. Transformers typically have a life of 25 to 75 years, and normally do not require replacement during the life of a photovoltaic power station.|$|E
5|$|If the German {{air force}} had prevailed and {{attempted}} a landing, a much-reduced Royal Air Force {{would have been}} obliged to operate from airfields {{well away from the}} southeast of England. Any airfield that was in danger of being captured would have been made inoperable and there were plans to remove all portable equipment from vulnerable radar bases and completely destroy anything that could not be moved. Whatever was left of the RAF would have been committed to intercepting the invasion fleet in concert with the Royal Navy—to fly in the presence of an enemy that enjoys air superiority is very dangerous. However, the RAF <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> several advantages, such as being able to operate largely over friendly territory, as well as having the ability to fly for longer as, until the Germans were able to operate from airfields in England, Luftwaffe pilots would still have to fly significant distances to reach their operational area.|$|E
5|$|Kuznetsova rebounded at the Wuhan Open, {{reaching}} the semifinals which boosted her hopes {{to qualify for}} the WTA Finals {{for the first time since}} 2009. This run included defeating defending champion Venus Williams and Agnieszka Radwańska, after saving match point. She then lost to fellow Singapore contender Dominika Cibulková in a tight three set match. At the China Open, Kuznetsova received a bye into the second round due to her impressive performance at Wuhan. She defeated Misaki Doi but lost to yet another Singapore Contender Madison Keys in the third round. Being the favourite for the title in Tianjin after top seed Agnieszka Radwańska withdrew from her Quarterfinal match, Kuznetsova disappointingly lost to Alison Riske in the semifinals. This <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> her out of Singapore, until Serena Williams withdrew from Singapore and that left a spot up to grabs.|$|E

5|$|Scripps began {{trafficking}} in drugs, and carried heroin between Asia and Europe for a syndicate. Singapore authorities first encountered {{his name in}} 1987, {{when he was arrested}} at Heathrow Airport for possessing drugs. Police found a key on him that belonged to a safe deposit box in a bank in Orchard Road in Singapore, from which officers from Singapore's Central Narcotics Bureau seized 1.5kilogrammes (3.3lb) of heroin worth about US$1 million. For this and another drug offence, Southwark Crown Court in January 1988 sentenced him to seven years in jail. He escaped while on home leave but was later re-arrested. In July 1992, Winchester Crown Court added another six years to the original sentence, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> him behind bars until 2001 had he not escaped again.|$|E
5|$|In 1954 Hamling {{started a}} {{companion}} magazine, Imaginative Tales; in addition, his company Greenleaf Publishing was {{the publisher of}} Rogue, a men's magazine modelled after Playboy. In 1957 the liquidation of American News Company, a major distributor, meant that many magazines had to scramble to find new distributors. Independent distributors often required that the magazines be monthly, and that they be in a larger format than the digest-size common in science fiction magazines. The larger format required higher revenue to be profitable, {{but in many cases}} it proved impossible to attract the additional advertising income that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> the magazines afloat. By the end of 1958, many titles had disappeared as a result, with Imagination one of the victims; Hamling closed down both Imagination and its sister magazine to invest the money in Rogue instead. The last issue of Imagination was October 1958, the 63rd issue, while Imaginative Tales, retitled Space Travel, ceased with the November 1958 issue. There was no indication in either magazine that the end had come, though the last issue of Imagination omitted its letter, book review and pen-pal columns, all of which had appeared regularly in prior issues.|$|E
5|$|Muirchertach was {{skilled in}} diplomacy, and {{negotiation}} with the dowries {{of his daughters}} may {{have been part of}} a political game. While he may not have intended to honour his agreements with Magnus (or others), he needed the latter's assistance to crush Domnall. Magnus and Muirchertach went on joint raiding expeditions after the peace agreement, only interrupted by the winter of 1102–03. The sagas claim that Magnus wintered in Connacht, but since Connacht is incorrectly claimed to be Muirchertach's kingdom the location was corrected to Kincora, Munster by modern historians. Rosemary Power considered it more likely that Magnus <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> his fleet near Dublin. Magnus was probably allied with Muirchertach during his campaigns against Domnall and the Cenél nEógain in 1103, but (in contrast to the Norse sources) Irish sources (the Annals of Ulster and Annals of the Four Masters) do not describe their campaigns as successful. On 5 August 1103, Muirchertach unsuccessfully tried to subdue Domnall in the Battle of Mag Coba. Magnus did not take part, but his Dublin subjects fought with Muirchertach. Since Magnus was closing in on the Irish throne, Muirchertach may have wanted him out of the way. According to Morkinskinna and Heimskringla, the two agreed that Muirchertach was to bring Magnus and his men cattle provisions for their return to Norway; as this dragged on past the agreed time, Magnus became suspicious that the Irish planned an attack. He gathered his men on St. Bartholomew's Day (or the day before, according to Ágrip), 24 August 1103, and ventured into the country. It is possible that Magnus and his men made an incautious landing to raid cattle, or the Ulaid mistook the Norwegians for cattle-raiding Hebrideans. Alternatively, Muirchertach may have ordered the Ulaid to bring provisions to Magnus, inciting the Ulaid to ambush the Norwegians.|$|E

25|$|Anand's 45...Rc1+ {{was called}} the decisive mistake, after which White was able to defend the a3-pawn, {{exchange}} bishops, and win a second pawn. Instead, 45...Ra1, attacking White's a3-pawn, <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> the balance. With this win, Carlsen took a 3–2 lead.|$|E
25|$|Edith Head {{designed}} the costumes. Wilder, Head and Swanson agreed that Norma Desmond <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> somewhat {{up to date}} with fashion trends, so Head designed costumes closely resembling the Dior look of the mid-1940s. Embellishments were added to personalize them and reflect Norma Desmond's taste.|$|E

25|$|Contrary {{to common}} belief, Wardell was not uniquely {{responsible}} for the design. Bishop Goold instructed him to incorporate into the design as much as could be saved of the previous church. Thus he was forced retain the existing floor level, rather than raising it five metres which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> it on a level with the nearby street rather than below it.|$|E
25|$|The other front-runner was an {{investment}} company , headed by the {{former chief executive of}} Abbey, Luqman Arnold. Olivant <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> the Northern Rock brand. By 17 November, a total of ten companies had put forward proposals for the bank. Among the other suitors for Northern Rock were private equity firm Cerberus, JC Flowers and Lloyds TSB. In early December JC Flowers dropped out of the bidding.|$|E
25|$|Senegal drew with Uruguay {{to clinch}} {{their place in}} the second round, despite Uruguay coming back from 3–0 down to draw 3–3, in their last group game in Suwon. The South Americans couldn't find the fourth goal that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>kept</b> them in the Cup and thus were out of the tournament. At the end, Denmark won Group A with 7 points, {{followed}} by Senegal with 5 points. Uruguay were eliminated with 2 points and reigning Champions France with 1 point.|$|E
