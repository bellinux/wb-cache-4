5|$|Elite Force {{includes}} {{an arsenal of}} Star Trek–themed weapons, such as phasers and disruptors. The weapons vary in power, ammunition consumption and effectiveness in given situations. Usually, the player {{is equipped with a}} hand phaser, a low-damage weapon that automatically recharges ammunition, and a phaser compression rifle, a more powerful weapon with an optional sniper mode for long distance kills. Other weapons, acquired as the game progresses, include grenade launchers, stasis weaponry and pulse energy weapons. The player can restock on ammunition by using <b>wall-mounted</b> terminals that dispense weapon energy, or by picking up certain items in the game environment.|$|E
5|$|Although {{having the}} same floor plan, the House and Senate {{chambers}} are decorated very differently, with the former in terra cotta and teal colors and the latter in blue and gold. An oval cartouche in the carpet {{at the entrance to}} the House chamber features the state flower, the apple blossom. Presiding over the house is the speaker, whose chair is behind a desk in the center with a plaster and paint version of the state coat of arms. The Senate chamber is somewhat smaller than the House. The president of the Senate is the lieutenant governor, who presides over sessions from a walnut rostrum at the front of the chamber. Both the House and the Senate use computerized voting systems, including <b>wall-mounted</b> screens that allow visitors to follow the voting and both also contain glass tiled ceilings that allow natural light to shine through etched glass panels to better light the room. These ceiling tiles feature the coats-of-arms of each state in the United States.|$|E

40|$|The {{average cost}} for {{installation}} of electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) at workplace locations was $ 2, 223. The average installation cost for workplace charging EVSE was 75 % {{of the average}} cost to install publicly accessible EVSE ($ 2, 979). Twenty-seven percent of the workplace EVSE installed were <b>wall-mount</b> units, while 17 % of the publicly accessible EVSE units were <b>wall-mount</b> units. Greater flexibility in {{the location of the}} workplace installations provided installation cost savings opportunities not typically available to EVSE installed for public use. Future expansion of workplace charging infrastructure represents a significant installation cost concern for employers, because these expansions will frequently require additional electrical service capacity...|$|R
5|$|An {{example of}} the first-person shooter genre, Elite Force is based on {{gameplay}} conventions shared by multiple other games. The game is focused on story-driven combat within a 3D environment, with all activity viewed as if from {{the eyes of the}} game's protagonist. The player controls the movement of the player character through walking, crouching, jumping or interacting with the environment. The only exception to this is in cut scenes, where the player loses control of the character to a third-person view for scripted events. The player character possesses numerical values for their health and armor, which are displayed on the game's heads-up display. As the player character takes damage from non-player characters and certain aspects of the environment, both values will decrease; when the health value reaches zero, the player character will die. Armor lessens the impact to the player character's health from hostile action, but once depleted the player will be more susceptible to damage. However, both armor and health can be restored by using <b>wall-mounted</b> terminals or from receiving assistance from certain friendly non-player characters such as the Doctor.|$|E
5|$|During exploration, the Prince navigates areas {{filled with}} traps: these traps include spike pits, arrow traps, <b>wall-mounted</b> blades and saws, and {{spinning}} spiked stakes. The Prince's main contextual move is wall-running, an action where he runs up onto and along a wall {{for a set}} distance, either to land on or jump off to a platform. The Prince's other acrobatic abilities include climbing along and across ledges, walking along beams, swinging on and jumping from poles, jumping onto and between pillars, and swinging on ropes. Large environmental puzzles are encountered during the Prince's journey, extending across multiple areas in large rooms. Many puzzles are cooperative, requiring Farah's help to complete them. In combat, the Prince fights monsters created by the Sands infecting the Palace's inhabitants. A single command contextually triggered different moves depending on position and directional movement, while other special moves such as a somersault attack and bouncing off walls into enemies require additional commands. Enemies can only be killed by stabbing them with the Dagger of Time, which gathers up the Sands inside them.|$|E
5|$|Lost Coast {{uses the}} same first-person shooter {{gameplay}} mechanics as Half-Life 2. The game is viewed {{from the perspective of}} the player character, and plot information is imparted through scripted sequences rather than cutscenes. A heads-up display at the bottom of the screen shows the player's health, energy gauge, and ammunition status, while available weapons are shown at the top. Health and armor energy can be replenished by picking up medical supplies and energy cells respectively, or by using <b>wall-mounted</b> charging devices. The player character is equipped with a small armory of weapons from Half-Life 2 at the beginning of the level, including a pistol, shotgun, crossbow, and gravity gun. The gravity gun allows the player to manipulate physical objects in the world; it can be used to pick up nearby objects and throw them at enemies or create cover from enemy fire. The gravity gun can also be used to perform several non-combat functions, such as grabbing out-of-reach supply crates.|$|E

25|$|Not to be {{confused}} with the urinal in bottle form that is used in healthcare, a urinal is a specialized toilet for urinating only, generally by men and boys. It is <b>wall-mounted,</b> with drainage and automatic or manual flushing. The urinal was patented by Andrew Rankin on March 27, 1866.|$|E
25|$|In April 2015, {{the company}} {{unveiled}} its Powerwall home and industrial battery packs, and quickly received orders valued at US$800 million. The two models included a 7 kilowatt-hour (kWh) <b>wall-mounted</b> unit and 10 kWh unit. The company announced larger-scale configurations for industrial users in units of 100 kWh. The company planned {{to open source}} its patents for the entire range.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} the 1880s, the Post Office had begun to {{encourage}} homeowners to attach <b>wall-mounted</b> mailboxes {{to the outside of}} their houses in lieu of mail slots. Mounted at the height of a standing man, attached mailboxes did not require the mail carrier to lean over to deposit the mail. They also allowed the homeowner to keep outgoing mail dry while awaiting pickup by the mail carrier.|$|E
50|$|Group Challenge - The Cabinets - Dez {{must lead}} the group into {{finishing}} {{the floor and}} mount the eight upper cabinets. After having each person assemble one box, Casey and Joe are assigned to finishing the floor, while Dez lets Tex and Charmaine {{take charge of the}} <b>wall-mounting</b> brackets. Joe and Dez run into Tex's outward-swinging door as they complete the floor(to which they address by tearing down Tex's door), while Tex and Charmaine manage to mount the eight cabinets, but without securing the cabinets to each other or mounting the cabinet doors. In the end, Dez concedes defeat.|$|R
5000|$|Ruth - Ruth's main trouble (as was {{the case}} for nearly everyone) was having trouble in finding a stud. In {{drilling}} holes in the drywall (in the wall opposite where her toilet used to be), she drills two oversized holes using a screwdriver bit, then tries to drill a hole for a wall plug with a drill bit too small for the plug to fit. Attempting to ream a larger hole using the same bit on her fourth try also fails. In the end, although she has her <b>wall-mount</b> in place, her TV is not mounted at all.|$|R
5000|$|Modern {{fixtures}} {{are usually}} in a rugged plastic or metal housing securely bolted to the wall or ceiling. The signs have the word [...] "EXIT", or a picture representing exit, on both sides. Single-sided signs are also available for <b>wall-mount</b> installations. The signs often have metal or plastic knock-outs which can be removed so that an arrow is also lit pointing left or right. Modern exit signs are often combined with other safety devices, such as emergency floodlighting. Exit signs draw a relatively small amount of power, and can generally be added onto any existing electrical circuit without adverse effects. Modern exit signs are also, to some degree, flame retardant.|$|R
25|$|On Sunday 9 April 1967 a <b>wall-mounted</b> marble {{monument}} to the victims in the Church of England parish church of St Lawrence, Toot Baldon was dedicated at a special service. There is a small roll of honour beneath, and an RAF ensign and a standard of the Oxford Branch of the Parachute Regimental Association flank the monument. Wreaths are laid at the monument during an annual commemorative service at the church, usually on the first Sunday in July.|$|E
25|$|For those neighbourhoods where mail {{delivery}} to a mail slot is still provided, mail slots {{must have an}} opening not less than 17.5cm by 4cm, and must be located in a front door or adjacent panel not more than 125cm and not less than 60cm from the finished floor line. <b>Wall-mounted</b> mailboxes equipped with a slot must have a slot opening measurement not less than 13.5cm by 4cm and the slot located {{on or near the}} top of the box.|$|E
25|$|The dock {{maintenance}} workshops {{are also}} survivors from the 1880s but were extended {{in the early}} 20th century. The brick building is topped with a tiled double-pile hipped roof with corbelled eaves. It has sliding doors at each end, giving access to the boiler and engine houses, blacksmith's and engineer's shops. Much of the original machinery survives, including steam-powered plant from the mid-1880s, these include a Whitworth planing machine, a Whitworth slotting machine, punching-and-shearing machines, a long-bed lathe and a steam hammer. There is also <b>wall-mounted</b> line-shafting and a Tangye horizontal engine and Cornish boiler.|$|E
5000|$|The Trimline handset was {{produced}} in both rotary dial and Touch-Tone versions. Rotary dial Trimline production began in late 1965 and Touch Tone dials were added the following year in mid-1966. The Trimline base was available in desk-top and <b>wall-mount</b> versions. The handsets and bases were interchangeable. The Trimline was the first US telephone to achieve some design recognition in Europe, where it {{was referred to as}} the [...] "Manhattan" [...] model or the [...] "Gondola". Today, similarly designed telephones are sold by many companies. AT&T retained the Trimline name for the later [...] "Trimline III", a more compact successor featuring squared corners and straight lines.|$|R
50|$|If an LCD is {{subjected}} to physical shock, this could cause one or more TAB connections to fail inside the display. This failure is often caused by horizontally flexing the chassis (e.g., while <b>wall-mounting</b> or transporting a display face up/down) or simple failure of the adhesive holding the TAB against the glass. TAB faults require replacement of the LCD module itself. If these connections were to fail, the effect would be that an entire row or column of pixels would fail to activate. This causes a horizontal or vertical black line {{to appear on the}} display {{while the rest of the}} display would appear normal. The horizontal failure runs from edge-to-edge; the vertical failure runs from top-to-bottom.|$|R
5000|$|In May 2015, {{one more}} {{valuable}} exhibit {{returned from the}} Staraya Derevnya Restoration and Storage Centre of the State Hermitage Museum - the 12-bolt diving helmet {{that belonged to the}} Senior Chief Navy Diver Nikita Sergeyevich Myshlyaevskiy, who died underwater in the Gulf of Finland not far from Shepelevo Lighthouse in 1944 during a combat mission. The <b>wall-mount</b> display panels show all milestones of the diving history in Russia from its very beginning: foundation and life of the Kronstadt Naval Diving School in pictures by Karl Bulla (1913) of Central Diving Station of the Public Transport Committee, [...] Special diving expedition EPRON (Russian “ЭПРОН”), vessel recovery operations, divers’ pre-war and Great Patriotic War trainings.|$|R
25|$|The public {{entry and}} double-height {{reception}} area are intact and feature {{black and white}} terrazzo floors, and marble-clad walls, columns, reception desk, planterbox and window sills. An original <b>wall-mounted</b> bronze artwork depicting the historical evolution of the wheel is retained in the entrance foyer. Within the front portico, L1 is a mezzanine level retaining original balustrades: iron near the southern glazing and battened timber above the reception area. Mounted on the end wall of the lift foyer facing the front entrance is Communications, a large artwork by Leonard Shillam.|$|E
25|$|Water {{and steam}} based central heating systems have {{traditionally}} had overall control by <b>wall-mounted</b> bi-metallic strip thermostats. These sense the air temperature using the differential expansion of two metals to actuate an on/off switch. Typically the central {{system would be}} switched on when the temperature drops below the set point on the thermostat, and switched off when it rises above, with a few degrees of hysteresis to prevent excessive switching. Bi-metallic sensing is now being superseded by electronic sensors. A principal use of the bi-metallic thermostat today is in individual electric convection heaters, where control is on/off, based on the local air temperature and the set point desired by the user. These are also used on air-conditioners, where local control is required.|$|E
25|$|What was {{probably}} New Jersey's first summer resort was on Tucker's Island off shore from Little Egg Harbor. The island sported boarding houses, private cottages, and a school. In 1848 a Lighthouse was erected there, with Eben Rider {{as its first}} light keeper. In 1869 the Little Egg Harbor Lifesaving's Station was constructed there. Also known as Sea Haven, the island contained two hotels. The island was wiped away in a storm, including its lighthouse, which fell into the sea. At the Tuckerton Seaport Museum a re-created lighthouse has been built {{as well as other}} re-created buildings that were on Tuckers Island. In the lighthouse there are several <b>wall-mounted</b> pictures showing the instant that the original lighthouse fell into the sea. The original island remains under water.|$|E
40|$|A {{training}} {{program in the}} newer methods of treatment of acute cardiopulmonary emergencies which was developed at the University Hospital, University of Saskatchewan, is reported. Artificial respiration by the chance rescuer, primary and secondary resuscitation, and post-resuscitation measures involving the use of special drugs and equipment by trained personnel are described. Figures and tables designed for <b>wall-mounting</b> and ready reference in an emergency situation are presented. Firstaid ventilatory adjuncts for use by trained personnel are classified and critically appraised, and the propriety of their use is emphasized. A plea is made to the medical profession and allied agencies to assume the responsibility of spreading knowledge of the new techniques more widely. Unless effective treatment is instituted early enough to prevent death or permanent anoxic damage to heart and brain, follow-through therapy will often be fruitless...|$|R
40|$|It is {{commonly}} assumed {{that efforts to}} simultaneously develop energy efficient building technologies and to improve indoor environmental quality (IEQ) are unfeasible. The primary {{reason for this is}} that IEQ improvements often require additional ventilation that is costly from an energy standpoint. It is currently thought that health and productivity in work and learning environments requires adequate, if not superior, IEQ. Despite common assumptions, opportunities do exist to design building systems that provide improvements in both energy efficiency and IEQ. This report outlines the selection of a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system to be used in demonstrating such an opportunity in a field study using relocatable school classrooms. Standard classrooms use a common wall mounted heat pump HVAC system. After reviewing alternative systems, a <b>wall-mounting</b> indirect/direct evaporative cooling system with an integral hydronic gas heating is selected. The anticipated advantages of this system include continuous ventilation of 100 percent outside air at or above minimum standards, projected cooling energy reductions of about 70 percent, inexpensive gas heating, improved airborne particle filtration, and reduced peak load electricity use. Potential disadvantages include restricted climate regions and possible increases in indoor relative humidity levels under some conditions...|$|R
40|$|The factory-built {{relocatable}} classroom (RC) is {{a dominant}} {{force in the}} school facility construction industry in the US and elsewhere. {{it is estimated that}} there are approximately 650, 000 RCs currently occupied in the US, housing about 16 million students. RCs receive public attention due to complaints about poor indoor environmental quality (IEQ). Both measured data and anecdotal evidence in California have suggested excessive acoustical noise from heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment as a central factor leading to degraded IEQ. In the US, RCs are typically equipped with unitary exterior <b>wall-mount</b> HVAC systems, and interior acoustical noise due to structural and airborne transmission can reach levels of about 58 dB(A) with compressor cycling, under unoccupied conditions. Due to these noise levels, teachers often simply choose to turn off the HVAC, leading to inadequate ventilation, as well as poor thermal conditioning, and thus to poor indoor air quality. Elevated levels of carbon dioxide and volatile organic compounds including formaldehyde are common. They discuss the acoustic component of the efforts to develop and test energy efficient HVAC systems that address the ventilation, controls, and acoustic requirements necessary to ensure high quality indoor environments in RCs...|$|R
