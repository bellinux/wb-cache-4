Siegel took over the numbers racket in Los Angeles. He used money from the syndicate to build a drug trade route from the U.S. to Mexico and organized gambling circuits with the Chicago syndicate's Trans-America Wire Service.|$|E
25|$|Slocum {{intended}} to sail eastward around the world, using the Suez Canal, but <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Gibraltar {{he realized that}} sailing through the southern Mediterranean would be too dangerous for a lone sailor because of the piracy that still went on there at that time.

At that point {{he was unable to}} start across the Pacific for forty days because of a storm. Eventually {{he made his way to}} Australia, sailed north along the east coast, crossed the Indian Ocean, rounded the Cape of Good Hope, and then headed back to North America.|$|E

25|$|Karel Kaers, the {{youngest}} man {{to win the}} world road championship, also won the Ronde in 1939– without intending to. For him, it was training for Paris–Roubaix. He drove to the Kwaremont hill near Kluisbergen, parked his car, then rode 40km to the start in Ghent. His plan was to ride round the course with his usual training partner, stop <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> his car, then drive home. Knowing he wasn't riding the whole distance, Kaers jumped clear of the field– again as training– and rode up the Kwaremont with a minute's lead. But his car wasn't there. He pressed on instead and won the race. His manager had driven the car away to save Kaers from temptation.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the chief}} engineer, {{who was in the}} engine control room {{at the time of the}} accident, the vessel {{suddenly}} heeled port around 12:30 and would not righten itself. Within the next 10–15 seconds, the list increased to 4–5 degrees and, after briefly stopping at 10 degrees, Finn-Baltic capsized. At the same time, the chief officer noticed that the ship had developed a permanent list to port, realized that something was wrong and decided to head to the bridge. However, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the door of his cabin, the combination turned over and he was washed away by the water flowing through the broken cabin window. The rising water column carried the chief officer upwards in the staircase until, only seconds from drowning, he arrived at the corridor next to the ship's sauna, which was below the main deck and thus above the surface.|$|E
25|$|The {{team won}} their first game in 1953, against Murray State, and lost the {{rest for a}} record of 1–7. One {{of the most memorable}} games of the season came in a 59–6 loss against Tennessee. Unitas {{completed}} 9 of 19 passes for 73 yards, rushed 9 times for 52 yards, returned 6 kickoffs for eighty-five yards, 1 punt for three yards, and had 86 percent of the team's tackles. The only touchdown the team scored was in the fourth quarter when Unitas made a fake pitch to the running back and ran the ball 23 yards for a touchdown. Unitas was hurt later in the fourth quarter while trying to run the ball. On his way off the field, he received a standing ovation. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the locker room he was so worn that his jersey and shoulder pads had to be cut off because he could not lift his arms. Louisville ended the season with a 20–13 loss to Eastern Kentucky. In his junior year, Unitas completed 49 of 95 passes for 470 yards and three touchdowns.|$|E

500|$|After the band's movie {{debut in}} Roger Corman's Rock 'n' Roll High School (1979), renowned {{producer}} Phil Spector {{became interested in}} the Ramones and produced their 1980 album End of the Century. During the recording sessions in Los Angeles, Spector held Johnny at gunpoint, forcing him to repeatedly play a riff. Though it was to be the highest-charting album in the band's history—reaching number 44 in the United States and number 14 in Great Britain—Johnny made clear that he favored the band's more aggressive punk material: [...] "End of the Century was just watered-down Ramones. It's not the real Ramones." [...] This stance was also conveyed by the title and track selection of the compilation album Johnny later oversaw, [...] Despite these reservations, Johnny did concede that some of Spector's work with the band had merit, saying [...] "It really worked <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> a slower song like 'Danny Says'—the production really worked tremendously. 'Rock 'N' Roll Radio' is really good. For the harder stuff, it didn't work as well." [...] The string-laden Ronettes cover [...] "Baby, I Love You" [...] released as a single, became the band's biggest hit in Great Britain, reaching number8 on the charts.|$|E

Martin Lopez, Villa's godson, led the attack because Villa was sick at the time. At about 1:10 am Lopez attacked the city itself. The cavalry charged ahead of the infantry and advanced in a way so that no bullets were crossing the border into El Paso. At first the Villistas seemed to be making progress—they cut through barbed wire entanglements with wire cutters smuggled in from the US and routed a line of Carrancista infantry. Then, as Lopez proceeded into the city streets, the advance began to slow. For {{the rest of the morning}} and throughout day the two sides fought a bloody close-quarters engagement. Gen. Gonzalez was held up in the Municipal Palace and observing the battle from the rooftop. As his lines crumbled he asked his assistant, Col. Escobar, why his forces were not holding. Escobar told him it was because the [...] "Villistas were attacking like rabid dogs." [...] Escobar also advised that Gonzales withdraw his forces into the nearby fortress, or else be overrun. Gonzalez agreed with Escobar so the order was given to retreat and the Villistas took complete control of the city. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the fort, Gonzalez used the telephone to contact the American garrison across the river and request aid.
