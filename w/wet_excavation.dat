40|$|Root/shoot {{relations}} of two cultivars of pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) were studied on a sandy soil at Sadore in Niger using a <b>wet</b> <b>excavation</b> method. For the first 10 days after emergence (DAE), {{the length of}} the seminal root showed an exponential growth rate while plant height increased more or less linearly. The maximum rooting depth for millet was 168 cm and the maximum number of root axes and primary laterals, 172 per plant. Root length continued to increase up to 75 DAE, the maximum length exceeding 5000 cm per plant. The proportion of total day matter accumulated in the roots decreased from 30 % in the early stages to less than 20 % by maturity. The <b>wet</b> <b>excavation</b> method is a promising technique for the rapid removal of intact root systems of pearl millet from the sandy soils of the Sahel...|$|E
40|$|Archaeological leather, {{especially}} that {{which comes from}} <b>wet</b> <b>excavation</b> sites, has long challenged conservators who wish to preserve {{it so that it}} will be long lasting, stable, and informative for cultural analysis. Both the unique structure of the artifact and the detrimental waterlogged environment must be overcome to achieve acceptable results. Many methods have been used to conserve leather with varying degrees of success. The three most common methods of conservation are drying, consolidation, and the use of chemical dressings. The purpose of this research is to compare two methods of consolidation: silicone impregnation and sucrose bulking. Silicone impregnation has been used in leather conservation with excellent results, and its effects have been compared with those of several other consolidation methods, but never to sucrose. In fact, sucrose has never been used as a conservation agent in leather, and has rather been used only in the conservation of waterlogged wood. Parallel testing of polymer bulking and sucrose impregnation confirmed the superiority of samples treated with Passivation Polymer technology in terms of retaining diagnostic characteristics. However, it also proved that sucrose impregnation may serve as a quick, cheap, and reversible method of conservation, particularly for developing conservation programs...|$|E
