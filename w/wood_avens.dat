50|$|<b>Wood</b> <b>avens</b> {{was stated}} to be a {{treatment}} for poison and dog bites. Paracelsus suggested its use against liver disease, catarrh and stomach upsets.|$|E
50|$|Other plants used {{occasionally}} are barren strawberry (Potentilla sterilis), tormentil (Potentilla erecta), {{salad burnet}} (Sanguisorba minor), bramble (Rubus fruticosus), dog-rose (Rosa canina) and <b>wood</b> <b>avens</b> (Geum urbanum).|$|E
50|$|Herbaceous {{plants are}} typical for this area: sweetscented bedstraw, <b>wood</b> <b>avens,</b> white dead-nettle, yellow archangel, {{cleavers}} and blackberries. There are no protected or endangeres species {{of this type}} of plants.|$|E
5000|$|On August 27, 2000, Valdéz was {{pitching}} for the Dodgers and was {{ejected from}} a game {{after he was}} accused of retaliating and throwing pitches at the head of Cubs first baseman Mark Grace. The incident began {{in the top of the}} fifth inning when Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood yielded the second of two home runs to the Dodgers' Bruce <b>Aven.</b> <b>Wood</b> then threw a pitch close to the next batter, Alex Cora, on the first pitch after Aven's second home run. Wood denied that he was trying to hit Cora, but in the bottom of the fifth, Valdes came close to hitting Grace on the first pitch, drawing a warning from home plate umpire Mark Wegner. Then, four pitches later, Valdéz hit Grace on the shoulder, and was ejected. [...] In September, Frank Robinson, major league baseball's head of on-field discipline, suspended Valdéz for six games and fined him $1,000 for the incident. [...] Valdes initially appealed, but several days later dropped his appeal and began serving his suspension.|$|R
50|$|Being {{adjacent}} to woodland, plants of the woodland varieties grow along the fields edges, such as barren strawberry, wood spurge and <b>wood</b> <b>avens,</b> with various ferns. The woodland trees include oak, wild cherry and field maple.|$|E
50|$|Most common {{tree species}} are pedunculate oak, red maple, silver maple and box elder, {{but there are}} many others as well. There are {{numerous}} wildflowers on the forest floor, including <b>wood</b> <b>avens,</b> violets, strawberries, garlic mustard, deadnettles etc.|$|E
50|$|Habitats {{include a}} pond and beehives, and {{woodland}} with a mature cooper beech {{and a black}} mulberry distorted with age. There are invertebrates such as stag beetles, frogs, toads and newts. Shade-tolerant plants include enchanter's-nightshade, lords-and-ladies and <b>wood</b> <b>avens.</b>|$|E
50|$|Geum urbanum, {{also known}} as <b>wood</b> <b>avens,</b> herb Bennet, colewort and St. Benedict's herb (Latin herba benedicta), is a {{perennial}} plant in the rose family (Rosaceae), which grows in shady places (such as woodland edges and near hedgerows) in Europe and the Middle East.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{woodland}} wildflower {{species are}} also present, including for bluebells, <b>wood</b> <b>avens,</b> Herb Robert, and more rarely wood sorrel, enchanter's nightshade, cow wheat and bilberry. The latter is normally a heathland species, {{but here it}} thrives due to the acidic soils present at the site.|$|E
50|$|About {{one-quarter of}} the site is {{occupied}} by willow carr, dominated by crack willow, Salix fragilis, beneath which the field layer contains a mix of tall fen and woodland plants, the latter including <b>wood</b> <b>avens,</b> Geum rivale, male fern, Dryopteris filix-mas, and, {{at the edge of}} the carr, globe flower, Trollius europaeus.|$|E
50|$|In folklore, <b>wood</b> <b>avens</b> is {{credited}} {{with the power to}} drive away evil spirits, and to protect against rabid dogs and venomous snakes. It was associated with Christianity because its leaves grew in threes and its petals in fives (reminiscent of, respectively, the Holy Trinity and the Five Wounds). Astrologically, it was said to be ruled by Jupiter.|$|E
50|$|Woodland plants include wood sorrel, blackthorn, bird's nest orchid, wood anemone, bluebell, <b>wood</b> <b>avens,</b> bugle, ramsons, self-heal, dog violet, honeysuckle, holly, lords and ladies, {{herb robert}} and woody nightshade. Woods {{dominated}} by oak and birch, with lesser amounts of rowan, holly, hazel, yew and aspen are called western oakwoods and occur principally in the uplands of Ireland, Scotland and Wales. They are temperate rainforests.|$|E
50|$|The Old Wood in {{particular}} has a high biodiversity, some of the species noted in 2007 beingWoodruff, Bird cherry, Primrose, Common violet, Oak, Stitchwort, Opposite-leaved Golden saxifrage, Bluebell, Greater Woodrush, Dog's mercury, Broad buckler fern, Lord and Ladies, Lady fern, Male shield fern, Easter ledges, Wood-rush, Wood-sedge, blackthorn, hawthorn, elm, alder, Wood anemone, Wood sorrel, <b>Wood</b> <b>avens,</b> Herb Robert, Red campion, and many liverworts. A number of badger setts are present.|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} part of Fox Reservoir, which was opened in 1888 and drained in 1943 to prevent it {{being used as a}} navigational aid for German bombers in World War II. The area was {{acquired}} by the Municipal Borough of Ealing in 1949 for public open space. Part of it is ancient woodland, and other areas are on the sloping area of the drained reservoir. It has a variety of plant species, including wood anemones, <b>wood</b> <b>avens</b> and garlic mustard.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{distinct}} assemblages of flora are observed at Briarwood Banks. Dominant on lower slopes is wych elm (Ulmus glabra), beneath which are found dog’s mercury (Mercurialis perennis), woodruff (Galium odoratum), wood melick (Melica uniflora), giant bellflower (Campanula latifolia), enchanter’s nightshade (Circaea lutetiana) and <b>wood</b> <b>avens</b> (Geum urbanum). Oak (Quercus petraea) predominates the higher slopes with creeping soft-grass (Holcus mollis), false brome (Brachypodium sylvaticum), wood sorrel (Oxalis acetosella) and broad buckler-fern (Dryopteris dilatata); and on very acid soil beneath oaks, great wood-rush (Luzula sylvatica), bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and common cow-wheat (Melampyrum pratense) are found.|$|E
50|$|Usually {{reaching}} a height between 20 and 60 cm, <b>wood</b> <b>avens</b> blooms between May and August, and its flowers are 1 - 2 cm in diameter, having five bright yellow petals. The hermaphrodite flowers are scented and pollinated by bees. The fruits have burrs, {{which are used}} for dispersal by getting caught in the fur of rabbits and other animals. The root {{is used as a}} spice in soups and also for flavouring ale.Geum urbanum hybridises fairly regularly with Geum rivale (water avens), as they are closely related and occur together.|$|E
50|$|The {{woodlands}} {{here have}} a high plant biodiversity value and are a registered provisional wildlife site as designated by the Scottish Wildlife Trust. Species noted in 2007 include the Woodruff, Bird cherry, Primrose, Common violet, Oak, Stitchwort, Golden male (Scaly) fern, Bugle, Opposite-leaved Golden saxifrage, Bluebell, Dog's mercury, Broad buckler fern, Watercress, Lady fern, Male shield fern, Kidney vetch, Woodrush, Woodsedge, blackthorn, hawthorn, Marsh marigold, Foxglove, Sweet Cicely, Herb Robert, Red campion, Bistort, Ribwort plantain, Water avens, <b>Wood</b> <b>avens,</b> Moschatel, elm, alder, and many liverworts. A pair of Buzzards were noted.|$|E
50|$|Gypsey springs are {{watercourses}} {{that are}} intermittent and irregular. They are found {{all over the}} Yorkshire Wolds. The Gypsey Race which passes through the Great Wold Valley is {{the best known of}} these watercourses. It is a chalk stream which supports large stands of bur-reed. West of Boynton, Boynton Willow Garth SSSI is an example of fen carr with a mosaic of habitats consisting of fen, scrub, woodland and running water. In the more open areas of the lower valley vegetation includes meadowsweet and great willowherb. Under the woodland canopies <b>wood</b> <b>avens</b> and enchanters nightshade are present.|$|E
50|$|A small flat birch-dominated {{woodland}} {{with a good}} {{circular path}} around it, the site has a public footpath running immediately past the entrance {{as well as a}} connecting path running from the Pennine Way. The site has a large count of bramble species (14) and a varied ground flora that includes remote sedge, bluebell, <b>wood</b> <b>avens</b> and dog rose. The woodland is very good for fungi with candle snuff fungus, fly agaric and common puff ball among the fruiting bodies seen. Butterflies include the speckled wood, common brimstone and peacock whilst the normal array of birds common to such habitat can also be found such as long-tailed tit, jay, wren and treecreeper.|$|E
50|$|A {{profusion of}} daffodils {{in early spring}} is welcomed by the residents. Marsh {{marigold}} by the river, wood sorrel and <b>wood</b> <b>avens</b> on the river bank. The caraway flower comes in summer in damp pasture near the river. The caraway is the county flower of Carmarthenshire and is similar in appearance to the lady's smock, or cuckoo flower. There are purple orchids near some silver leaf limes {{at the top of}} the village. The dominant trees are beech and ash and some sycamore and oaks to a lesser degree. Yellow pimpernel can be seen for short periods in shady banks under ash trees. Red campion, stitchwort and bluebell contribute a magnificent red, white and blue to the hedgerows in spring. Dog violet and birds foot trefoil grow for shorter periods.|$|E
50|$|The plants {{growing on}} the Carneddau need to be {{extremely}} hardy to withstand the snow, frosts, and gales they will encounter during the year and those found by sheltered streams in the valleys {{are very different from}} those clinging to crevices on windswept rocks. Sheep graze the mountains and impact the composition of the sward, nibbling out the most succulent young growth. Where the sheep are fenced out globe flowers, <b>wood</b> <b>avens,</b> angelica, red campion and roseroot can be found at lower elevations, along with ash, alder, hawthorn, holly and rowan. Higher up on scree there are Welsh poppies and in damp crevices under rocks the rare Wilson's filmy fern. Boggy areas support cotton grass, marsh orchid, sundew and bog asphodel. The better-drained rocky slopes have bilberry, ling, bell heather and cross-leaved heath and the summit ridge has prostrate dwarf willows, sedges, mosses and lichens.|$|E
5000|$|Native {{species are}} {{currently}} under threat by invasive {{species such as}} Acaena ovalifolia, two-spined Acaena (sometimes called pirri-pirri burr), a small herb whose velcro-like seeds stick to whatever passes spreading the plant far and wide. In the past five years, pirri-pirri burr has spread rapidly over most of Gillies Hill out-competing such natives as dog violet, <b>wood</b> <b>avens,</b> wild strawberry and wood sorrel.One of the concerns regarding resumed quarrying of the hill {{is the potential for}} this species to be spread throughout Scotland with whinstone extracted and exported from the quarry.Rhododendron ponticum which was planted on the hill in the 19th century as a decorative shrub has spread uncontrollably, sometimes to many times the height of a person, effectively blocking sunlight from reaching the woodland species that carpet the forest floor, and creating a dark sterile understory devoid of life.Bracken, Pteridium aquilinum, has colonized several of the hill’s open areas so thickly with its rhizomatous roots that few other species can compete for survival. (In the north of Scotland wild boar have recently been re-introduced in controlled environments and are successfully rooting out the bracken allowing a new generation of woodland to become established.) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the area}} is divided into layers like any natural habitat in the temperate climatic zone. On the field layer are mosses and fungi (penny bun or cep, honey fungus), in addition there is the herbaceous layer, which is characterized by various species depending on the season. In spring when the soil is warmed up quickly by sunlight, spring flowers like hepatica appear, which conjure up blue carpets on the forest floor, followed by anemone. As the temperatures rise, leaves sprout on the trees. The level of sunlight under the trees reduces and species such as Spring Vetchling, Lily of the Valley, May Lily, Moschatel, Herb Paris and Woodruff appear, which flourish under conditions of low light. As the foliage becomes denser, shade-loving summer flowers appear. The first ones are the remaining native orchids of our deciduous forests. On the Streckelsberg: Common Twayblade, Lesser Butterfly-orchid, Bird's-nest Orchid and Red helleborine. Rather less colourful summer flowers in the beech woods are the Small Balsam, Common Figwort, <b>Wood</b> <b>Avens,</b> Wall Lettuce, Baneberry and Enchanter's-nightshade. Characteristic grasses of the herbaceous layer of the beech forest are False Brome, Wood Melick and Giant Fescue. The overlying shrub layer consists of bushes and saplings, such as Elder, Rowan, Fly Honeysuckle, Common Honeysuckle, Dewberry, Raspberry, Blackthorn, Common Ivy, Alpine Currant, Hazel, Goat Willow, Bird Cherry, three species of wild rose, Common Buckthorn and Viburnum. There are also young trees of the species Norway Maple, Sycamore and Silver Birch. The tree layer is dominated by beech trees that are more than 180 years old and, {{on the slopes of}} the hill, by equally ancient Scots Pines.|$|E
5000|$|The council estate Aspley {{contains}} two parks, these are Melbourne Park, just off Melbourne Road and the King George V Playing Fields which lies between Beechdale Road and Aspley Lane. The former a host {{to one of}} the Nottinghamshire branches of the YMCA since 2000.Located within the ward are two natural nature reserves. Within the Bells Lane estate is the Quarry Holes Plantation, the reserve {{can be found in a}} now defunct magnesian limestone quarry. Although beginning life as a quarry, with the building of nearby estates and suburbs during the interwar period, the area now boasts a range of foliage including false oat-grass, <b>wood</b> <b>avens</b> and Comfrey. As with Broxtowe Country Park, the Quarry Holes Nature Reserve has also benefitted from recent restoration schemes. Starting in 2012, work began to clear the reserve of overgrown foliage in an effort to allow new wildlife to grow.Also located within the ward is Broxtowe Country Park, covering over 46 hectares, the park has been a fixture in the area since before 1066, then originally known as Broculeston. In recent years the park has benefitted from several different rejuvenation projects, in February 2012 the park was earmarked to receive funding for a new cycle path at the cost of £170,000, the work being completed in March 2012. In reference to the new cycle path Councillor Leon Unczur revealed [...] "We have received some great feedback, particularly from the local community, about the new entrances and footpaths which marked the beginning of a whole series of improvements that we intend to make to Broxtowe County Park. We secured some external funding which can only be used to create cycle paths and so this is the perfect bolt-on to our existing programme of improvements to this park". The new 2 km cycle path links two major roads in the area, Nottingham Road (which is close to the Phoenix Park tram stop) and Woodhouse Way.|$|E
40|$|Plant {{species in}} {{fragmented}} populations {{are affected by}} landscape structure because persistence within and migration among inhabited patches {{may be influenced by}} the identity and configuration of surrounding habitat elements. This may also be true for species of the semi-natural vegetation in agricultural landscapes. To determine the effect of landscape elements we analyzed <b>Wood</b> <b>Avens</b> (Geum urbanum L.) populations within three 4 × 4 km 2 agricultural landscapes in Germany, Switzerland and Estonia, which differ in levels of land use intensity and habitat fragmentation. Genetic variation was determined in 15 randomly selected populations in each landscape using 10 microsatellite loci. The landscape structure was assessed at two circles around each population, with radii defined by the range limits of spatial genetic autocorrelation. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the influence of landscape structure variables for inter- and intrapopulation genetic diversity. Gene diversity was equally high in Germany (He= 0. 27) and Switzerland (He= 0. 26) but lower in Estonia (He= 0. 16). A high overall inbreeding coefficient (FIS= 0. 89) was found, as expected for a selfing breeding system in G. urbanum. Genetic differentiation among populations was high (overall FST= 0. 43, 0. 48, and 0. 45 in Estonia, Switzerland and Germany, respectively), and did not differ among the three landscapes. Only a moderate influence of individual land use types on genetic diversity within and among populations was found with some idiosyncratic relationships. Genetic variation within populations was correlated to the amount of hedgerows positively in Estonia but negatively in Switzerland. The study demonstrates that the distribution of individual land use types affects the genetic pattern of a common plant species. However, different variables were identified to influence the genetic structure in three different landscapes. This indicates a major influence of landscape-specific land use history and stochastic processes determining gene flow and plant population structur...|$|E
