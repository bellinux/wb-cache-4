25|$|Minimum {{wages are}} used widely in {{developing}} countries to protect vulnerable workers, reduce wage inequality, and lift the working poor out of poverty. The political popularity of minimum wages stems {{in part from the}} fact that the policy offers a means for redistributing income without having to increase government spending or establish formal transfer mechanisms. The challenge to policymakers is to find that <b>wage</b> <b>level</b> that is considered fair given workers' needs and the cost of living, but does not harm employment or a country's global competitiveness.|$|E
25|$|By the 1650s, {{when this}} boom period reached its zenith, {{the economy of}} the Republic {{achieved}} a classic harmony between its trading, industrial, agricultural, and fishing sectors, their interrelations cemented by productivity-enhancing investments. The gains in output had increased tremendously {{over the course of a}} century: the carrying capacity of the ocean-going fleet had increased by 1 percent annually; agricultural output per laborer had increased by 80 percent since 1500 (thanks to the pursuit of comparative advantage via agricultural specialization). The overall productivity of labor was reflected in the <b>wage</b> <b>level,</b> which was the highest in Europe at the time.|$|E
40|$|We examine gender {{concentration}} and segregation between and within establishments in the British economy, using the 1990 Workplace Industrial Relations Survey.

We find that high female concentration, both within occupational groups and within workplaces, depresses <b>wage</b> <b>levels</b> substantially, when other factors known to effect <b>wage</b> <b>levels</b> are controlled for.

It is noteworthy that the Guangdong provincial government {{announced that it would}} maintain 2015 minimum <b>wage</b> <b>levels</b> in 2016 and 2017, and the minimum wage growth rate in Shanghai has decreased from 12.3 in 2015 to 8.4 percent in 2016.

Five of Maersk's routes were terminated and the flight slots reallocated to other Scandinavian markets. The new company sold Maersk Air Cargo to SAS on 1 October 2005.|$|E
25|$|Two {{significant}} {{factors are}} evident: First, every column in Figure 166 depicts a net benefit that {{is higher than}} any column in Figure 165. In other words, the average married person (with a stay-at-home spouse) gets a greater benefit per FICA tax dollar paid than does the average single person – {{no matter what the}} gender or <b>wage</b> <b>level.</b> Second, there is only limited progressivity among married workers with stay-at-home spouses. Review Figure 166 carefully: The net benefits drop as the wage levels increase from $50,000 to $95,000; however, they increase as the wage levels grow from $5,000 to $50,000. In fact, net benefits are lowest for those earning just $5,000 per year.|$|E
25|$|In {{the field}} of health care, various {{measures}} were introduced to improve the quality and availability of health care provision. Free hospital care was introduced for 9 million recipients of social relief, while a contributory medical service for 23 million panel patients was introduced. Pensioners were exempted from paying a 2% health insurance contribution, while improvements in health insurance provision were carried out, as characterised by an expanded sickness insurance scheme, with the inclusion of preventative treatment. The income limit for compulsory sickness insurance was indexed to changes in the <b>wage</b> <b>level</b> (1970) and the right to medical cancer screening for 23.5 million people was introduced. In January 1971, the reduction of sickness allowance in case of hospitalisation was discontinued. That same year, compulsory health insurance was extended to the self-employed. In 1970, the government included nonmedical psychotherapists and psychoanalysts in the national health insurance program.|$|E

25|$|The {{decline in}} per capita income growth {{at the end of}} the 18th century may appear as a counterargument against the modernity of the Dutch economy. However, at closer {{inspection}} this was actually a modern process of restructuring in the face of adverse circumstances, as may be seen in current modern economies, like the United States and European countries, that also undergo major structural upheavals. The 18th-century deindustrialization was in large part a consequence of a too-high real <b>wage</b> <b>level,</b> combined with protectionist policies of foreign governments, closing access to major markets. The agricultural depression was a general European phenomenon. The crisis in foreign trade was answered, and partly parried, with commercial innovations. The financial and fiscal crisis that proved the Republic's undoing was altogether modern in nature (unlike the comparable crises that regularly brought the Spanish Crown to its knees), but simply happened before the modern means of dealing with it (expansion of the tax base and/or monetary inflation) were at hand.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} of Dutch industry and agriculture was a defensive realignment in three directions. First, {{there was a}} shift in the product mix to higher value products (for instance more luxury textile products, livestock fattening instead of dairy farming). This was of necessity a self-limiting solution, as it made exporting even more difficult, so this response led to a further contraction of the sectors in question. The second response was investment in labor-saving means of production. However, this required a level of technological innovation that apparently was no longer attainable. (In this respect it is remarkable that the number of patents granted in the Netherlands was remarkably lower in this period than {{in the first half of}} the 17th century.) Besides, this type of reorientation in investment was undercut by a third response: outsourcing of industrial production to areas with a lower <b>wage</b> <b>level,</b> like the Generality Lands, which solved the high-wage problem in a different way, but also contributed to deindustralization in the maritime provinces.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Urban Institute economists C. Eugene Steuerle and Adam Carasso {{created a}} Web-based Social Security {{benefits}} calculator. The calculator {{does not include}} the value or cost of the Social Security disability program. Using this calculator it is possible to estimate net Social Security benefits (i.e., estimated lifetime benefits minus estimated lifetime FICA taxes paid) for different types of recipients. In the book Democrats and Republicans – Rhetoric and Reality Joseph Fried used the calculator to create graphical depictions of the estimated net benefits {{of men and women who}} were at different wage levels, single and married (with stay-at-home spouses), and retiring in different years. These graphs vividly show that generalizations about Social Security benefits may be of little predictive value for any given worker, due to the wide disparity of net benefits for people at different income levels and in different demographic groups. For example, the graph below (Figure 168) shows the impact of <b>wage</b> <b>level</b> and retirement date on a male worker. As income goes up, net benefits get smaller – even negative.|$|E

Two complementary data sources are used: panel data on state <b>level</b> <b>wages</b> of police officers, and individual level data on police officers from Decennial Censuses. The empirical results from both data sets are remarkably consistent and provide no robust evidence that the presence of arbitration statues has a consistent effect on overall <b>wage</b> <b>levels.</b> On average, the effect of arbitration is approximately zero, although there is substantial heterogeneity in the estimated effects across states. ...|$|R

2500|$|According to Lassalle, wages cannot {{fall below}} {{subsistence}} <b>wage</b> <b>level</b> because without subsistence, laborers {{will be unable}} to work. [...] However, competition among laborers for employment will drive wages down to this minimal level. This follows from Malthus' demographic theory, according to which population rises when wages are above the [...] "subsistence wage" [...] and falls when wages are below subsistence. Assuming the demand for labor to be a given monotonically decreasing function of the real wage rate, the theory then predicted that, in the long-run equilibrium of the system, labor supply (i.e. population) will rise or fall to the number of workers needed at the subsistence wage.|$|E
2500|$|The last graph shown (Figure 167) is a {{combination}} of Figures 165 and 166. In this graph it is very clear why generalizations about the value of Social Security benefits are meaningless. At the $95,000 <b>wage</b> <b>level</b> a married person could be a big winner – getting net benefits of about $165,000. On the other hand, he could lose an estimated $152,000 in net benefits if he remains single. Altogether, there is a [...] "swing" [...] of over $300,000 based upon the marriage decision (and the division of earnings between the spouses). In addition there is a large disparity between the high net benefits of the married person earning $95,000 ($165,152) versus the relatively low net benefits of the man or woman earning just $5,000 ($30,025 or $41,890, depending on gender). In other words, the high earner, in this scenario, gets a far greater return on his FICA tax investment than does the low earner.|$|E
2500|$|The {{content of}} the iron law of wages has been {{attributed}} to economists writing earlier than Lassalle. For example, Antonella Stirati notes that Joseph Schumpeter claimed that Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot first formulated the concept. Some (e.g., John Kenneth Galbraith) attribute the idea to David Ricardo. According to Terry Peach, economists interpreting Ricardo as having a more flexible view of wages include Haney (1924), J. R. Hicks (1973), Frank Knight (1935), Ramsay (1836), George Stigler (1952), and Paul Samuelson (1979). She sees Ricardo, for example, as being closer to the more flexible views of population characteristic of economists prior to Malthus. The theorist Henry George noticed that Ricardo's Law of Rent did not imply that a reduction of wages to subsistence is an immutable fact, but that it instead points the way towards reforms that could greatly increase real wages, such as a land value tax. Ricardo drew a distinction between a natural price and a market price. For Ricardo, the natural price of labor was the cost of maintaining the laborer. However, Ricardo believed that the market price of labor or the actual wages paid could exceed the natural <b>wage</b> <b>level</b> indefinitely due to countervailing economic tendencies: ...|$|E

The original assumption was that there is a long-term equilibrium. The uncertainty was connected to the question whether that equilibrium predicates wage changes. The results show that indeed, oil price is an important driver of <b>wage</b> <b>levels</b> in a small open, oil-exporting economy, such as the Norwegian one. Long-run relationship between the movements in oil prices and <b>wage</b> <b>levels</b> have been detected through a cointegration method, using the error correction model estimation.
