According to the book Evita: A Biography by John Barnes, while she {{traveled}} down a street with many people crowding her car, someone threw two stones and smashed the windshield. She threw her hands up in shock, but was not injured. Later, while sitting with the Foreign Minister, protesters threw tomatoes at her. The tomatoes hit the Foreign Minister and splattered on Eva's dress. After these two events, Eva had had enough, and after two months returned to Argentina.|$|E
5|$|In March 1909, Riley was {{stricken}} {{a second}} time with Bell's palsy, and partial deafness, the symptoms only gradually eased {{over the course of}} the year. Riley was a difficult patient, and generally refused to take any medicine except the patent medicines he had sold in his earlier years; the medicines often worsened his conditions, but his doctors could not sway his opinion. On July 10, 1910 he suffered a stroke that paralyzed the right side of his body. Hoping for a quick recovery, his family kept the news from the press until September. Riley found the loss of use of his writing hand the <b>worst</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the stroke, which served only to further depress him. With his health so poor, he decided to work on a legacy by which to be remembered in Indianapolis. In 1911 he donated land and funds to build a new library on Pennsylvania Avenue. By 1913, with the aid of a cane, Riley began to recover his ability to walk. His inability to write, however, nearly ended his production of poems. George Ade worked with him from 1910 through 1916 to write his last five poems and several short autobiographical sketches as Riley dictated. His publisher continued recycling old works into new books, which remained in high demand.|$|E

The subway cars in the worst condition were the R10s. The subway line with the worst signals was the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, so the signals were upgraded in the 1980s.

25|$|After an {{initially}} unremarkable voyage, On {{the morning}} of 5 February the Tuscania turned south for the North Channel en route to Liverpool. Most of those aboard, in sight of the Irish coast to starboard and the Scottish coast to port, surely believed the <b>worst</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> their journey was behind them. Spotted by German submarine UB-77 earlier in the day, however, their convoy was stalked until early evening and the cover of darkness. Then, at about 6:40 pm, submarine captain Lt. Cdr.

25|$|In early 2000s Fortum Shipping, the {{transportation}} {{arm of the}} Finnish energy company Fortum, started a major fleet renewal program {{to increase the efficiency}} and reduce the average age of its vessels. The program also included replacing the company's old tankers, such as the 90,000-ton Natura, that were used to transport crude oil to the company's oil refineries in the Gulf of Finland. The old ships had traffic restrictions during the <b>worst</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the winter because of their lower ice class of 1C and could not deliver their cargo {{all the way to the}} refineries in Porvoo and Naantali because they were denied icebreaker assistance. When this happened, the oil had to be transported to smaller ships of higher ice class at the edge of the ice — a practice that was both uneconomical and hazardous.|$|E
25|$|For {{many of the}} Federal soldiers, {{the voyage}} to Hatteras Inlet was the <b>worst</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the battle. Earning its reputation, the weather in the {{vicinity}} of Cape Hatteras turned foul, causing many of them to become seasick. In an act of bravado, Burnside left his comfortable quarters aboard the transport George Peabody and with his staff went aboard Army gunboat Picket. He chose this vessel because he considered her to be the least seaworthy ship in his command, and by showing his troops {{that he was willing to}} share their misery, he earned their devotion. When the storm struck, he began to doubt the wisdom of his move, but Picket survived and got him safely to his destination. Three vessels in the armada were not so lucky: City of New York, laden with ordnance and supplies; Pocahontas, carrying horses; and Army gunboat Zouave were all lost, although all persons aboard were rescued. The only personnel losses were two officers of the 9th New Jersey, who were drowned when their surfboat overturned following a visit to the flagship.|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{positive}} acclaim in Halo, {{the response to}} the presence of the Flood in Halo2 and Halo3 was mixed.

Similarly, reviewers including Victor Godinez of The Dallas Morning News felt that the Flood were too derivative of other sci-fi stereotypes, and functioned as [...] "space zombies". Daniel Weissenberger of Gamecritics.com noted in his review of Halo3 that even though the Flood looked better than ever, their single strategy of rushing the player proved tedious over time. GamesRadar's Charlie Barratt listed the Flood as the <b>worst</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Halo, contrasting what he considered fun, vibrant and open levels before the Flood's appearance with confined spaces and predictable enemies.|$|E

The skeleton crew of the factory uses a self-replicating fluid called the Flesh from which they create doppelgängers of themselves, colloquially called [...] "Gangers". The crew control the Gangers from special harnesses, operating in the hazardous environment of the factory via the disposable bodies. The Doctor, initially posing as a weatherman, fears the <b>worst</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the solar tsunami will strike the solar-powered factory soon, threatening those still remaining, and offers to take the crew in his TARDIS.

The music was also a source of praise, and was noted as such in the IGN reviews and the GameSpot reviews, which called it an [...] "excellent symphonic soundtrack" [...] with terrific melodies.

N. Macleod then asked Buchanan for permission to be present, and was granted leave on the condition that he not tell anyone—especially the chief—what was about to be done. The next morning the chest was forced open and the flag was found to be held within a wooden case. N. Macleod described the flag then as being a square-shaped piece of cloth with crosses wrought on it with gold thread, and several [...] "elf spots" [...] stitched onto it. After the flag had been examined, it was placed back into its case. N. Macleod stated that at around this time it was learned that the heir to the chiefship, Norman, was killed at sea. The HMS Queen Charlotte, on which he was a lieutenant, caught fire and exploded at sea killing 673 officers and men. N. Macleod stated that at about the same time, MacLeod's Maidens were sold to Campbell of Ensay. He also stated that he personally saw a fox with cubs, which lived in the west turret of the castle. N.

During the <b>worst</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> her experience Lancashire described herself as [...] "hysterical {{at the thought of}} getting out of bed". Her mother Hilda forced her to seek medical assistance for her condition, which Lancashire states [...] "gave me my life back", her twenties having been [...] "a write-off". Lancashire felt her first marriage had also contributed to her unhappiness; in 2001, she stated that though her marriage lasted ten years, it [...] "was 10 years longer than it should have done". [...] In 1995 she separated from Hargeaves; the pair would ultimately later divorce. She described leaving her marriage as a [...] "cleansing experience" [...] and a [...] "renaissance"; one that enabled her to rediscover her sense of identity. Other steps that Lancashire took to combat her depression included remaining single for five years, attending therapy sessions, and taking prescriptions of the anti-depressant drug Paroxetine. In December 1995 Lancashire starred in the spin-off straight-to-video film Coronation Street– The Cruise, a 75-minute special detailing Raquel and Curly's honeymoon. The special was advertised as being exclusive to video, and 750,000 copies were sold, to the value of £10million. Lancashire departed Coronation Street in 1996 due to her heavy work schedule and desire to pursue other projects. She had also tired of the fame the role brought her, shying away from personal appearances and interviews with television magazines. Her final scenes attracted 20million viewers. Lancashire's performance in the role saw her nominated in the Most Popular Actress category at the 2nd National Television Awards in October 1996.|$|E

IGN writer Cindy White said the episode did not feel like The Office and called it [...] "the exact opposite". Despite this, she went on to compliment Susan asking Andy on a date and the pairing of Darryl and Val as a couple, saying that the latter had possibilities. She ultimately gave the episode a 7.5/10.
