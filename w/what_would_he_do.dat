500|$|Delsin's Native American {{heritage}} {{came from}} the game's setting in the Pacific Northwest, which features a large Native American population. Delsin wears a beanie inspired by one that Harper would wear around the studio (Harper recounted one particular staff meeting where {{four of the six}} team members were wearing hats). Delsin's character was inspired by United Kingdom street artist Banksy, as the development team appreciated Banksy's clandestine, satirical work. Developing Delsin's personality, the team posited the hypothetical: [...] "What if Johnny Knoxville had powers? <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> with it?". Harper considered Delsin [...] "full of reckless abandon", the kind of character that would, upon gaining superpowers, jump off a cliff to see what happens. Fox considered Delsin [...] "flawed in a way I think a lot of us can relate to", trying {{to live up to his}} successful brother Reggie. He called the game's story a [...] "hero's journey".|$|E

6000|$|... "No, indeed; M. Gordeloup knew better. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> if I {{were shut}} up? And {{no one will}} ever shut you up, my dear. If I were you, I would give no one a chance." ...|$|E
6000|$|CORNELIUS [remonstrating]. Father Dempsey is {{the priest}} of the parish, Mr Broadbent. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> be <b>doing</b> with a theory? ...|$|R
60|$|Her clear {{brown eyes}} looked full {{at him as}} she spoke, and all the young {{population}} watched to see <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do.</b> <b>He</b> hesitated a moment, then took up his cup and plate, {{and sat down in}} the window- seat.|$|R
60|$|We all {{waited to}} see <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do,</b> to hear <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> say, next.|$|R
6000|$|Some base {{streak of}} {{competitiveness}} in Mr. Britling's nature {{made it seem}} impossible that he should relinquish the lady to Oliver. Besides, then, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> with his dull days, his afternoons, his need for a properly demonstrated affection? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> there, sahib? He {{would have}} no friends, none to care for him; and while his Mahratti tongue would be of great service to him, here, it would be useless to him in his own country.|$|E
6000|$|<b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> Marguerite at {{the thought}} instinctively pressed {{her hands to her}} heart, the agony of it all had become {{physically}} painful. She hoped that perhaps this pain meant approaching death! oh! how easy would this simple solution be! ...|$|E
25|$|Lockbox/Rainy Day fund: Gore's {{description}} of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> {{with the federal}} budget surplus.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{he looked}} round to his men, who were {{watching}} eagerly to know <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done</b> next.|$|R
6000|$|... '"It is {{very hard}} to leave you, George," [...] she said; [...] "but it is God's will, and you must bear it for my sake. Oh! how I thank Him for having taken our boy! He is happy, and in heaven now. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> have <b>done</b> here, without his mother!" ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{his face}} only glistened on her, unknown, horrible. And {{yet she was}} fascinated. Her impulse was to repel him violently, break from this spell of mocking brutishness. But she was too fascinated, she wanted to submit, she wanted to know. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> to her? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Tom, father didn't wish it," [...] said Maggie, her {{anxiety about}} his feeling helping her to master her agitation. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> {{when she told}} him all? [...] "But mother wants you to come,--poor mother!--she cries so. Oh, Tom, it's very dreadful at home." ...|$|E
6000|$|All {{the little}} meadow people {{gathered}} around the hole where Johnny Chuck and Reddy Fox had disappeared. They were very anxious, very anxious indeed. Would Reddy Fox catch Johnny Chuck? And <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> to him? Was all their fun to end in something terrible to sunny-hearted, merry Johnny Chuck, whom everybody loved? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> knew <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do.</b> <b>He</b> <b>would</b> {{write to}} Garcia & Jones, his San Antonio merchants where {{he bought his}} {{supplies}} and sold his wool, and have them send down a big box of novels and reading matter for Marthy. Things {{were going to be}} different. He wondered whether a little piano could be placed in one of the rooms of the ranch house without the family having to move out of doors.|$|R
60|$|After {{having said}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do,</b> Kenton paced to and fro, keeping sharp watch upon the thicket, and saying nothing.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the hall}} of the hotel he passed the lady and gentleman--and, of course, noticed the lady. She was little and dark {{and would have been}} pretty, if she had not looked ill and out of spirits. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> have said, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> have <b>done,</b> if <b>he</b> had known that those two strangers were Randal Linley's brother and Roderick Westerfield's daughter? ...|$|R
60|$|Lenore again saw {{his eyes}} dim. How strangely {{sensitive}} he was! If he exaggerated {{such a little}} kindness as she had suggested, if he responded to it with such emotion, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> when the great and marvelous truth of her love was flung in his face? The very thought made Lenore weak.|$|E
60|$|She {{could see}} that now. She felt sure that if {{she told him she}} did not wish ever to see him again he would never appear before her. But <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> She was not in the least afraid of him, but his fierce earnestness frightened her, not for herself, but for him. Suddenly a thought struck her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr. McLennan {{has built}} a whole social theory on the statement' (a single statement) 'made by Sir George Grey, and contradicted by Mr. Curr.' Mr. McLennan would be, I think, rather {{surprised}} at this remark; but <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> Why, he would re-examine the whole question, decide by the balance of evidence, and reject, modify, or retain his theory accordingly.|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be <b>doing</b> if <b>he</b> were not a musician, <b>he</b> stated <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be [...] "skateboarding".|$|R
6000|$|BLAYNE. That's just <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do,</b> damn him. Oh! I say, Anthony, you {{pretend to}} know everything. Have {{you heard about}} Gaddy? ...|$|R
5000|$|When asked <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> {{differently}} {{in the five years}} since his ALS diagnosis, Stephen Heywood replied, “Have more sex on film.” ...|$|R
6000|$|But now, {{in a few}} weeks' time, {{her second}} baby would be born. The first had died, an infant, when her husband first went out to France. She looked with joy and relief to {{the coming of the}} second. It would be her salvation. But also she felt some anxiety. She was thirty years old, her husband was a year younger. They both wanted the child very much. Yet she could not help feeling afraid. She had her husband on her hands, a terrible joy to her, and a terrifying burden. The child would occupy her love and attention. And then, what of Maurice? <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> If only she could feel that he, too, would be at peace and happy when the child came! She did so want to luxuriate in a rich, {{physical}} satisfaction of maternity. But the man, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do?</b> How could she provide for him, how avert those shattering black moods of his, which destroyed them both? ...|$|E
6000|$|Nevertheless I enjoyed {{hearing him}} talk, and {{encouraged}} him {{with bits of}} questions and exclamations. Did he believe, perhaps, in the pagan Gods?--Mars and all that? Was there, even at this very moment, cramped up among the moss and the roots, a crazy, brutal Pan in the woods? And those delicious Nymphs and Naiads! <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> if one beckoned to him?--or Pan's pipes began wheedling? ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{thoughts}} {{came back}} to the dancing little figure in purple-striped pyjamas. She had a scared sense of irrevocable breaches. <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> to-morrow? What should she do to-morrow? Would he speak to her at breakfast or should she speak first to him?... She wished she had some money. If she could have foreseen all this she would have got some money before she began....|$|E
6000|$|And {{there was}} a pause, both much {{affected}} {{by the thought of}} the good old man's ever ready consideration. At last Fanny said, [...] "I am sure it was well for us! <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> have <b>done</b> without you?--and," [...] she added, [...] "do you really mean that you never heard of her all these years?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{gave them}} {{the details of the}} plot; told them <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> himself, and <b>what</b> they should do, and finally {{dismissed}} them.|$|R
5000|$|If I Was God: Daryn {{discusses}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> if <b>he</b> were God while {{speaking with}} a vocal effect {{to make him}} sound like God.|$|R
60|$|And then, what then? <b>What</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do,</b> when {{something}} failed {{and there was}} no one to fix it for him? That would be the end. Someplace, far out in the cold darkness of space, the ship would slow down, silent and lifeless, to exhaust its last heat into the eternal timelessness of outer space. Or perhaps it would crash on some barren asteroid, burst into a million fragments.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have {{done with}} Hal," [...] said Captain Merrifield, still with displeasure. [...] "I wouldn't take him now on any account. If the Grevilles lead him wrong, <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> among the mids? If he acts dishonourably here, {{we should have}} him disgracing himself and his profession. Since he can't take it, and you won't, I shall try to make some {{exchange}} of the chance till John or David will be old enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was torn}} {{out of the}} dead man's hand. Why was some one so anxious to get {{possession}} of it? Because it incriminated him. And <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> with it? Thrust it into his pocket, most likely, never noticing that a corner of it had been left {{in the grip of}} the corpse. If we could get the rest of that sheet it is obvious that we should have gone a long way towards solving the mystery." ...|$|E
5000|$|In August 2015, asked <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> with {{prisoners who}} {{remain at the}} Guantanamo Bay {{detention}} camp in Cuba, Bush replied: [...] "Keep 'em there." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{had slipped}} down the tree-trunk, and headed {{like the wind}} in bare feet for the Bee Rocks, before the dholes saw <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "No doubt. He {{has been}} good enough to amuse me with mysterious threats as to <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> to punish me if I would not--" ...|$|R
