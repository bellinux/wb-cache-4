5000|$|Malcolm X {{noted that}} 1964 was an {{election}} year, a year [...] "when {{all of the}} white political crooks <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>back</b> in your and my community ... with their false promises which they don't intend to keep". He said that President Johnson and the Democratic Party claimed to support the civil rights bill, and the Democrats controlled both the House of Representatives and the Senate, but they had not taken genuine action to pass the bill. Instead, he said, the Democrats blamed the Dixiecrats, who were [...] "nothing but Democrats in disguise". He accused the Democrats of playing a [...] "political con game", with African Americans as its victims.|$|R

40|$|In {{his book}} Emotional Intelligence (1995), DanielGoleman {{describes}} a research study conducted at Stanford University. The test went something like this: Four-year-old Jeremy is ushered {{into a room}} and invited to sit at a table. The researcher tells Jeremy that he for-got something and <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>back.</b> On the table is a marshmallow. Jeremy is told that if he can leave the marshmallow there until the researcher returns, he <b>will</b> <b>be</b> given two marshmallows. But if he eats the one marshmallow while the researcher <b>is</b> gone, he <b>will</b> not get another one. Jeremy was one of over 500 four-year-olds who took this test at a Stanford University campus preschool. Some children (about two thirds) managed to wait, using strategies such as covering their eyes, talking to themselves, playing games, and even trying to go to sleep in order to avoid eating the marshmallow.

He infers to Staniford that he ought {{to spend more time with}} Lydia in order to keep her away from Hicks. Lydia comes up on deck to look for a lost kerchief and Staniford asks her if she has come to walk with again. Lydia angrily asks why Staniford would think that and Staniford, quickly covering his tracks, says that it was more of a hope that she would want to walk with him and not really a question. Lydia is slightly embarrassed and apologetic and does indeed walk with Staniford. Staniford and Lydia begin to talk romantically and flirt just as they had done before and Staniford conveys to Lydia that he does not like her spending time with Hicks because he is a shabby man and he is not to be valued. As their talk continues Staniford cannot help himself from thinking about making to love to Lydia but seeing that it is almost midnight he sends her off to bed. Staniford then confronts Hicks and tells him that Lydia has no interest in either of them so he ought to leave her alone.|$|R

5000|$|The A.V. Club {{explains}} [...] "in creating The Critic, Al Jean and Mike Reiss {{set out to}} {{make the}} show as dissimilar from The Simpsons as humanly possible". Nevertheless, there are many similarities between the two series. Gen X TV: The Brady Bunch to Melrose Place argues that The Critic became a critical success while other animated shows of the early 1990s flopped was because [...] "the makers of these shows failed to realize that The Simpsons didn't become a hit because of animation but because of its style of humor", and says that The Critic understood this. It adds the show [...] "took the media-obsession/parody portions of The Simpsons and created separate show around them". Planet Simpson describes the show as [...] "the closest thing The Simpsons ever had to a spin-off." [...] The Critic also shares The Simpsons love for criticizing Fox and the audience, such as Jay's frequent line [...] "You're watching Fox, shame on you" [...] and [...] "The Critic <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>back,</b> you TV addicted couch monkeys" [...] before the show went to commercial break. The A.V. Club says [...] "The Critic made its protagonist the anti-Homer Simpson. Where Homer is a booze-sodden everyman, Jay Sherman is an unabashed elitist. Where Homer is a rudely physical creature, Jay leads a life of the mind. Homer is a slob. Jay is a snob." [...] While [...] "Springfield is very aggressively and deliberately Anywhere, United States, The Critic is an extended Valentine to a certain kind of pointy-headed East Coast elitism." [...] PopMatters said [...] "The Critic's humor is very much in the spirit of The Simpsons, taken in a more brazenly surreal direction." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Bo Snerdley": The {{official}} [...] "program-observer" [...] {{and call}} screener. His {{real name is}} James Golden. With other staff members, he assists with research as part of preparation for the show {{and is in the}} control booth as the show is being broadcast. He co-hosted a Sunday night talk show, James and Joel, on WABC with Joel Santisteban from 1992 to 1998. Snerdley is a pseudonym Limbaugh invented many years earlier when he was a disc jockey on WIXZ (when Limbaugh went by the name Jeff Christy); he would use the name Snerdley for supposed-listeners who would write or call in, usually professing to be big fans and part of the [...] "Christy Nation". More recently, the name Snerdley has been used for his call screeners, both male and female. During a show in 2004, Limbaugh was not at the microphone for the last segment of the second hour (it was only about ten seconds), and Snerdley came on instead: [...] "This is Bo Snerdley, Rush <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>back</b> on the EIB Network (Excellence in Broadcasting)." [...] It was one of the very rare times his voice was heard on the program before 2008. [...] "Bo" [...] Snerdley screens callers at the Palm Beach Florida broadcasting location and in New York City. In February 2008, Snerdley, who is African-American, was appointed by Limbaugh as the show's Official Criticizer of Barack Obama: [...] "certified black enough to criticize" [...] On the July 24, 2009 show, [...] "Bo" [...] was put on the air as the [...] "Official Obama Criticizer", and spoke for roughly five minutes with Rush about the incident with Cambridge police. On October 16, he requested (and received) air time to air a five-minute rant that criticized NFL players, Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, and media commentators who opposed Rush Limbaugh's potential bid on the St. Louis Rams.|$|R

Though he has not disclosed details of his plans, he did say that they involve [...] "an old band from the '90s and early 2000s." [...] The musical plans Dewees has announced were rumored to be a reunion of his former band The Get Up Kids, and these rumors about their reunion were confirmed by the band on November 13, 2008, and the band played their first show since 2005 on November 16, 2008 in Kansas City.|$|R

50|$|Island {{challenge}} - In the First Round, {{the captains}} {{will have to}} climb up the fixed ladders attached {{to one of the}} trees, before swinging across to angle cable ladders to collect Giant Cogs. They then have to deliver these cogs into collection tubs {{at the base of the}} tree, and the captain who gets all 8 Cogs in their collection tubs first, wins. In the Second Round, one team member will have to climb up an angled cable ladder, collecting Giant Cogs one at a time, before passing them to their teammate who is climbing a matching cable ladder on the other side of the Forest Clearing. To make these passes, they have to swing towards each other. Once the cogs have been passed across, the second team member has to deliver it in the collection tub at the base of their angled ladder. If the Cog hits the ground it is out of play, and if an adventurer completely loses momentum and can not reach either ladder, they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> lowered <b>right</b> <b>back</b> to the ground. Both teams have 8 minutes to deliver as many cogs as possible, and whichever team has the most cogs in their collection tub when the time runs out wins.|$|R
