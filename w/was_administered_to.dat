5|$|Fairley tackled an {{outbreak}} of bacilliary dysentery among the troops in Egypt. In most cases the patients recovered {{of their own accord}} but some cases of shigellosis became seriously ill and died. Fairley had some Shiga anti-toxin with him, but it proved ineffective in serious cases, even when administered in large doses. However, he also had an experimental supply of sulphaguanidine that had been given to him by Dr E. K. Marshall of Johns Hopkins Hospital. The drug <b>was</b> <b>administered</b> <b>to</b> a patient with severe shigellosis who was not expected to live, and the patient soon recovered. Of the 21,015 Australian soldiers who contracted bacilliary dysentery during the Second World War, only 21 died.|$|E
5|$|Mercury(I) {{chloride}} (also {{known as}} calomel or mercurous chloride) {{has been used}} in traditional medicine as a diuretic, topical disinfectant, and laxative. Mercury(II) chloride (also known as mercuric chloride or corrosive sublimate) was once used to treat syphilis (along with other mercury compounds), although it is so toxic that sometimes the symptoms of its toxicity were confused with those of the syphilis it was believed to treat. It is also used as a disinfectant. Blue mass, a pill or syrup in which mercury is the main ingredient, was prescribed throughout the 19th century for numerous conditions including constipation, depression, child-bearing and toothaches. In the early 20th century, mercury <b>was</b> <b>administered</b> <b>to</b> children yearly as a laxative and dewormer, and it was used in teething powders for infants. The mercury-containing organohalide merbromin (sometimes sold as Mercurochrome) is still widely used but has been banned in some countries such as the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Polonium <b>was</b> <b>administered</b> <b>to</b> humans for {{experimental}} purposes from 1943 to 1947; it was injected into four hospitalised patients, and orally {{given to a}} fifth. Studies such as this were funded by the Manhattan Project and the AEC and conducted at the University of Rochester. The objective was to obtain data on human excretion of polonium to correlate with more extensive data from rats. Patients selected as subjects were chosen because experimenters wanted persons {{who had not been}} exposed to polonium either through work or accident. All subjects had incurable diseases. Excretion of polonium was followed, and an autopsy was conducted at that time on the deceased patient to determine which organs absorbed the polonium. Patients' ages ranged from 'early thirties' to 'early forties'. The experiments were described in Chapter 3 of Biological Studies with Polonium, Radium, and Plutonium, National Nuclear Energy Series, Volume VI-3, McGraw-Hill, New York, 1950. Not specified is the isotope under study, but at the time polonium-210 was the most readily available polonium isotope. The DoE factsheet submitted for this experiment reported no follow up on these subjects.|$|E

5|$|Since {{bupropion}} is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 enzyme, {{drug interactions}} with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: this includes medications like paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, diazepam, clopidogrel, and orphenadrine. The expected {{result is the}} increase of bupropion and decrease of hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (decrease of bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 inducers, such as carbamazepine, clotrimazole, rifampicin, ritonavir, St John's wort, phenobarbital, phenytoin and others. Conversely, because bupropion is itself a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (Ki = 21μM), as is its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion (Ki = 13.3μM), it can slow the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. As an example, the ratio of dextromethorphan (a drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6) to its major metabolite dextrorphan increased approximately 35-fold when it <b>was</b> <b>administered</b> <b>to</b> people being treated with 300mg/day bupropion, indicative of a major drug interaction with a common over-the-counter medicine.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization {{assisted}} the Iraqi government through {{the supply of}} drugs, analytical equipment and expertise. Many new treatments were tried, since existing methods for heavy metal poisoning were not particularly effective. Dimercaprol <b>was</b> <b>administered</b> <b>to</b> several patients, but caused rapid deterioration of their condition. It was ruled out {{as a treatment for}} this sort of poisoning following the outbreak. Polythiol resins, penicillamine and dimercaprol sulfonate all helped, but are believed to have been largely insignificant in overall recovery and outcomes. Dialysis was tested on a few patients late in the treatment period, but they showed no clinical improvement. The result of all treatments was varied, with some patients' blood mercury level being dramatically reduced, but a negligible effect in others. All patients received periods of treatment interspersed with lay periods; continuous treatment was suggested in future cases. Later treatment was less effective in reducing blood toxicity.|$|E

25|$|Buspirone {{appears to}} be {{relatively}} benign in cases of single-drug overdose, although no definitive data on this subject appear to be available. In one clinical trial, buspirone <b>was</b> <b>administered</b> <b>to</b> healthy male volunteers at a dosage of 375mg/day, and produced side effects including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, miosis, and gastric distress. In early clinical trials, buspirone was given at dosages even as high as 2,400mg/day, with akathisia, tremor, and muscle rigidity observed. Deliberate overdoses with 250mg and up to 300mg buspirone have resulted in drowsiness in about 50% of individuals. One death {{has been reported in}} association with 450mg buspirone together with alprazolam, diltiazem, alcohol, cocaine.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} by Pedersen et al. indicates that TNFα increase {{in response to}} sepsis is inhibited by the exercise-induced production of myokines. To study whether acute exercise induces a true anti-inflammatory response, a model of ‘low grade inflammation’ was established in which a low dose of E. coli endotoxin <b>was</b> <b>administered</b> <b>to</b> healthy volunteers, who had been randomised to either rest or exercise prior to endotoxin administration. In resting subjects, endotoxin induced a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of TNFα. In contrast, when the subjects performed 3 hours of ergometer cycling and received the endotoxin bolus at 2.5 h, the TNFα response was totally blunted. This study provides some evidence that acute exercise may inhibit TNF production.|$|E

25|$|The {{residents}} of Styles wake to find Emily Inglethorp dying of strychnine poisoning. Hastings, a house guest, enlists {{the help of}} his friend Hercule Poirot, who is staying in the nearby village, Styles St. Mary. Poirot pieces together events surrounding the murder. On the day she was killed, Emily Inglethorp was overheard arguing with someone, either her husband Alfred or her stepson John. Afterwards, she seemed quite distressed and, apparently, made a new will — which no one can find. She ate little at dinner and retired early to her room with her document case. The case was later forced open by someone and a document removed. Alfred Inglethorp left Styles earlier in the evening and stayed overnight in the nearby village, so was not present when the poisoning occurred. Nobody can explain how or when the strychnine <b>was</b> <b>administered</b> <b>to</b> Mrs. Inglethorp.|$|E
25|$|The first {{administration}} of the SAT occurred on June 23, 1926, when it {{was known as the}} Scholastic Aptitude Test. This test, prepared by a committee headed by Princeton psychologist Carl Campbell Brigham, had sections of definitions, arithmetic, classification, artificial language, antonyms, number series, analogies, logical inference, and paragraph reading. It <b>was</b> <b>administered</b> <b>to</b> over 8,000 students at over 300 test centers. Men composed 60% of the test-takers. Slightly over a quarter of males and females applied to Yale University and Smith College. The test was paced rather quickly, test-takers being given only a little over 90 minutes to answer 315 questions. The raw score of each participating student was converted to a score scale with a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of 100. This scale was effectively equivalent to a 200 to 800 scale, although students could score more than 800 and less than 200.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{has been}} found to {{directly}} interact with the ER. Although a study found that spironolactone did not interact with the human ER at the concentration range tested, a subsequent study found that the drug did interact with the human ER at higher concentrations, albeit with very low (micromolar) affinity (inhibition constant = 2 × 10−5). In the same study, spironolactone <b>was</b> <b>administered</b> <b>to</b> rats and found to produce mixed estrogenic and antiestrogenic or selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM)-like effects that were described as very similar to those of tamoxifen. In {{spite of the fact that}} tamoxifen had three orders of magnitude higher affinity for the ER than did spironolactone, the two drugs showed similar potency in vivo. It has been said that the likelihood of spironolactone interacting with the ER itself is remote in consideration of its very low affinity for the receptor in vitro. However, metabolism of spironolactone may result in metabolites with greater ER affinity, which could thus account for the activity.|$|E

25|$|Following the Army Alpha and Army Beta {{tests for}} {{soldiers}} in World War I, mental testing became {{popular in the}} US, where it was soon applied to school children. The federally created National Intelligence Test <b>was</b> <b>administered</b> <b>to</b> 7 million children in the 1920s, and in 1926 the College Entrance Examination Board created the Scholastic Aptitude Test to standardize college admissions. The results of intelligence tests were used to argue for segregated schools and economic functions—i.e. the preferential training of Black Americans for manual labor. These practices were criticized by black intellectuals such a Horace Mann Bond and Allison Davis. Eugenicists used mental testing to justify and organize compulsory sterilization of individuals classified as mentally retarded. In the United States, {{tens of thousands of}} men and women were sterilized. Setting a precedent which has never been overturned, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of this practice in the 1907 case Buck v. Bell.|$|E
25|$|Menéndez at once began {{disembarking}} his troops, landing {{two hundred}} of them. On Friday, September 7, {{he sent his}} three smaller ships into the harbor, and three hundred more colonists were landed, along with the married men, their wives, and children, {{and most of the}} artillery and ammunition. On Saturday, the feast of Our Lady of Charity, the balance of the colonists, one hundred in number, and supplies were put ashore. Then the Adelantado himself landed amidst the waving of flags, the sounding of trumpets and other instruments, and the salutes of the artillery. The chaplain, Mendoza, who had gone ashore the previous day, advanced to meet him, chanting the Te Deum Laudamus and carrying a cross which Menéndez and those with him kissed, falling upon their knees. Then Menéndez took possession in the King's name. The mass of Our Lady was solemnly chanted, and the oath <b>was</b> <b>administered</b> <b>to</b> the various officials {{in the presence of a}} large concourse of friendly Indians who imitated all of the postures of the Spaniards.
