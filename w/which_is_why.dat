5|$|Doctors will {{sometimes}} prescribe immunosuppressive {{drugs such as}} prednisolone and ciclosporin if the patient is suffering from an intense form of solar urticaria.

5|$|SR357 {{is one of}} two Ohio state routes on Lake Erie islands (the other being SR 575). Though this two-lane route travels {{predominantly}} eastwest, it once {{extended to}} the mainland of Ohio via the Catawba Island ferry, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> it carries a northsouth routing.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of O'Malley failed his intern test, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> {{he was not}} initially a resident along with Meredith, Yang, Karev, and Stevens.|$|E

50|$|Despite GK's {{warning to}} Paranji of not {{revealing}} it to anybody else, {{he tries to}} inform the Geological Survey of India about the deposits, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> he and Bilavar Singh, who was with him, were killed that day. GK suspects that Raju might also know about the Iridium deposit because he was with Paranji when he <b>was</b> killed <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> GK sent Govardhan to kill him, not to retrieve Subhashini. Raju was lured to Girdwala {{under the cover of}} delivering the insurance check to Bilavar Singh's family (GK had the insurance documents planted) and was attacked by Govardhan. GK needs the strong plastic glass from the plastic factory to pack the Iridium. He wanted the Pali villagers to vacate (to dig the Iridium ore without trouble) on their own to avoid suspicion, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> he poisoned Pali's environment using the plastic factory's waste.|$|R
50|$|While {{students}} {{demanded an}} apology and resignation from the Vice-Chancellor, {{he said that}} he felt his life was threatened by the student protest, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> he summoned police.|$|R
5|$|Beryllium's {{chemical}} {{behavior is}} largely {{a result of its}} small atomic and ionic radii. It thus has very high ionization potentials and strong polarization while bonded to other atoms, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> all of its compounds are covalent. It is more chemically similar to aluminium than its close neighbors in the periodic table due to having a similar charge-to-radius ratio.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan became {{patron saint}} of English goldsmiths and {{silversmith}}s because {{he worked as a}} silversmith making church plate. His Feast Day is 19 May, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> before the Restoration the date year on London Assay Office hallmarks ran from 19 May one year to 18 May the next, not the calendar year. This was changed at the restoration of Charles II in 1660 so that the hallmarking year began on the King's birthday, 29 May.|$|E
5|$|Her {{determination}} sometimes caused clashes {{of wills}} with Charles. In most matters of patronage, Mary had {{to defer to}} Charles, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> his relations in this area were not much better with Mary than with their aunt Margaret. He often criticized her decisions, which negatively affected their otherwise affectionate relationship.|$|E
25|$|McDonald acquiesced in Reuther's {{selection}} of John W. Livingston as the AFL-CIO's new organizing director, but Livingston {{was merely a}} functionary and not an aggressive organizer, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> McDonald approved of Livingston.|$|R
50|$|George W. Hunter {{noted that}} while Tungan Muslims (Chinese Muslims) would almost never prostitute their daughters, Turki Muslims (Uyghurs) would prostitute their daughters, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> Turki prostitutes <b>were</b> common around the country.|$|R

5|$|However, {{in order}} to {{accomplish}} its aims, morality must be legitimate in the eyes of those to whom it speaks. As Durkheim argues, this moral authority is primarily to be located in religion, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> in any religion one finds a code of morality. For Durkheim, it is only society that has the resources, the respect, and the power to cultivate within an individual both the obligatory and the desirous aspects of morality.|$|E
5|$|Three-quarters {{of adult}} smokers start the habit as teenagers, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> {{it is so}} irresponsible of Rihanna to {{influence}} her young fan base in this way... After so much hype around the filming of the video it was very disappointing to see Rihanna so blatantly smoking throughout it... Artists such as Rihanna are held in high esteem and regarded as role models by millions of young people.|$|E
5|$|While AASHTO {{guidelines}} specifically prohibit Interstate Highways and U.S. Routes from {{sharing a}} number {{within the same}} state (<b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> there are no Interstates 50 or 60), the initial Interstate numbering approved in 1958 violated this with I-24 and US24 in Illinois and I-40, I-80, US40 and US80 in California (US40 and US80 were removed from California in its 1964 renumbering).|$|E
50|$|Medon, {{the son of}} Codrus, was {{the first}} archon of Athens. He <b>was</b> lame, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> his brother Neileus would not let him rule, but the Delphian oracle {{bestowed}} the kingdom upon Medon.|$|R

5|$|A {{significant}} {{but small}} percentage of people have employment {{in the oil industry}} owing to the proximity of oil rigs on the Cromarty Firth. Other locally significant industries include forestry, tourism and catering. A significant number of people work in larger nearby localities, such as Inverness, Dingwall, Alness and Invergordon, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> only 14% of households in the zone own no car. 10.4% {{of the population of the}} zone are self-employed, and 28% economically inactive, roughly corresponding with the Highland averages. There are also two hotels and two bars, which soak up much of the tourist income that the town generates.|$|E
5|$|A veterinarian, Alfred Sewell, {{said the}} system Bayliss was using was {{unlikely}} to be adequate, but other witnesses, including Frederick Hobday of the Royal Veterinary College, disagreed; {{there was even a}} claim that Bayliss had used too much anaesthesia, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> the dog had failed to respond to the electrical stimulation. Bayliss said the dog had been suffering from chorea, a disease that causes involuntary spasm, and that any movement Lind af Hageby and Schartau had seen was not purposive. Four students, three women and a man, were called by Bayliss's counsel and testified that the dog had appeared to be unconscious.|$|E
5|$|Among other reforms was the Codex Theresianus, {{begun in}} 1752 and {{finished}} in 1766, that defined civil rights. In 1776, Austria outlawed witch burnings and torture. It was later reintroduced, but the liberal {{nature of these}} reforms remains noted. Much unlike Joseph, but {{with the support of}} religious authorities, Maria Theresa was opposed to the abolition of torture. Born and raised between Baroque and Rococo eras, she found it hard to fit into the intellectual sphere of the Enlightenment, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> she only slowly followed humanitarian reforms on the continent.|$|E
50|$|Mokoia Island {{is located}} in Lake Rotorua in New Zealand. It has an area of 1.35 square kilometres. The island is a {{rhyolite}} lava dome, rising to 180 metres above the lake surface. It was formed after the Rotorua caldera collapsed and rhyolitic magma was pushed through the cracks. One of the cracks was below where Mokoia island is today. The foreshores of the island have geothermal springs with hot spring water forming the Hinemoa pool, known to locals as Waikimihia. It also has very rich volcanic soil, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> the local Māori grew kumara on it. {{it was also a}} very good strategic location, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> it <b>was</b> often fought over.|$|R
25|$|Different {{ethnic groups}} had {{different}} attitudes toward prostitution. George W. Hunter (missionary) noted that Turki Muslims (Uyghurs) would prostitute their daughters, while {{such a thing}} would never happen among Tungan Muslims (Chinese Muslims), <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> Turki prostitutes <b>were</b> common around the country.|$|R
5000|$|The {{women in}} the case were not welfare beneficiaries. However, some women that were also forcefully sterilized were persuaded through threats to cut off their welfare access, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> some women feared the loss of that income and {{proceeded}} with the procedure.|$|R
5|$|In 1886, Johann Gottfried Spiesshofer and Michael Braun {{founded a}} factory for the {{production}} of corsets in Heubach (Baden-Wurttemberg). They first employed six people on the same number of sewing machines. That number rose to 150 people in 1890, and in 1894 their first exports were sent abroad, to England. It was only in 1902 that Spieshofer and Braun registered the Triumph brand, which was reminiscent of the Parisian Arc de Triomphe, to which International was later added. After the economic boom in the 1920s, demand for the classic corset declined, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> the company began parallel production of brassieres. In the 1930s, Triumph International also began producing corselets.|$|E
5|$|In animals, poly(A) {{ribonuclease}} (PARN) {{can bind to}} the 5' cap {{and remove}} nucleotides from the poly(A) tail. The level {{of access to the}} 5' cap and poly(A) tail is important in controlling how soon the mRNA is degraded. PARN deadenylates less if the RNA is bound by the initiation factors 4E (at the 5' cap) and 4G (at the poly(A) tail), <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> translation reduces deadenylation. The rate of deadenylation may also be regulated by RNA-binding proteins. Once the poly(A) tail is removed, the decapping complex removes the 5' cap, leading to a degradation of the RNA. Several other enzymes that seem to be involved in deadenylation have been identified in yeast.|$|E
5|$|It's {{about how}} people take drugs to connect to God or {{to a higher level}} of consciousness. I keep saying, 'Plugging into the matrix'. If you get high, you can do that, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's the {{illusion}} of drugs, because they give you the illusion of getting closer to God, but ultimately they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} my system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me. I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Serralves Villa {{was subject}} to a {{restoration}} initiative by the architect, Álvaro Siza. With a total area of 900 square metres, 700 square metres are used as exhibition spaces, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> the conservation intervention, in particular a restoration intervention, was necessary.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to accusations that the band sounded too poppy, Gottwald admitted in a 2007 interview that Anajo was {{a band that}} divided opinion, but added that the band's music came from the heart, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> it sounded poppy and at times kitsch.|$|R

5|$|Most {{moments in}} which there is a fantastic {{occurrence}} constitute a change in point of view, from the omniscient narrator to a specific character with particular beliefs. The introduction of magical events from the perspective of the slaves highlights their otherness, because while they may believe, for instance, that Macandal survived his execution, the whites, and especially the readers, know that he did not. The marvellous, emphasized in the Prologue, is a product of the characters' beliefs, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> there is the shift in perspectives when presenting it.|$|E
5|$|Since {{there were}} no playoff system in the APFA until 1932, a meeting was held to {{determine}} the 1920 APFA Champions. Each team that showed up had a vote to determine the champions. The All-Americans stated that they should win the award because they had more wins and were not beaten by the Akron Pros. Since the Akron Pros had a 1.000 winning percentage, however, the Pros were awarded the Brunswick-Balke Collender Cup on April 30, 1921. Ties were not counted in standings until 1972, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> Akron is credited with a 1.000 winning percentage. The sportswriter Bruce Copeland compiled the All-Pro list for the 1920 season. No player from the All-Americans were on the list.|$|E
5|$|The casting {{equipment}} and the metal dies represent large capital costs and this tends to limit the process to high-volume production. Manufacture of parts using die casting is relatively simple, involving only four main steps, which keeps the incremental cost per item low. It is especially suited for a large quantity of small- to medium-sized castings, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> die casting produces more castings than any other casting process. Die castings are characterized by a very good surface finish (by casting standards) and dimensional consistency.|$|E
25|$|Frank's style <b>was</b> very innovative, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> he {{had such}} {{difficulty}} with early acceptance. He would bend notes and sing about the chordal context of a note rather than to sing the note directly, and he stressed each rhythmic downbeat, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> different from the smooth balladeer of his time.|$|R
50|$|The {{great circle}} route is not used in this example because the route travels mostly over land. The sonic boom {{generated}} by travelling at supersonic speed can cause great discomfort for people on the ground, <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>why</b> Concorde <b>was</b> prohibited from flying supersonically over land.|$|R
60|$|His sorrows {{had made}} some change in his outward appearance; and yet the {{alteration}} was chiefly within. It might have been {{said that he had}} a wrinkled mind.
