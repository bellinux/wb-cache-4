In recent years a number of Super Mario World ROM hacks have been made by fans, notably Kaizo Mario <b>World,</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> been used for many Let's Play videos. In a similar way, Super Mario World is one of the four games whose assets are available in Super Mario Maker, a custom level creator released for the Wii U in 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{language}} {{family of}} the <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> the most speakers is the Indo-European languages, spoken by 46% of the world's population. This family includes major world languages like English, Spanish, Russian, and Hindustani (Hindi/Urdu). The Indo-European family achieved prevalence first during the Eurasian Migration Period (c. 400–800 AD), and subsequently through the European colonial expansion, which brought the Indo-European languages to a politically and often numerically dominant position in the Americas and much of Africa. The Sino-Tibetan languages are spoken by 20% of the world's population and include many of the languages of East Asia, including Hakka, Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese, and hundreds of smaller languages.|$|E

On the night of her 28th birthday, bail bonds collector Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) is reunited with Henry Mills (Jared S.

25|$|With {{the advent}} of the Information Age {{at the end of the}} 20th century, modern humans live in a <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> become {{increasingly}} globalized and interconnected. As of 2010, almost 2billion humans are able to communicate with each other via the Internet, and 3.3 billion by mobile phone subscriptions. Although interconnection between humans has encouraged the growth of science, art, discussion, and technology, it has also led to culture clashes and the development and use of weapons of mass destruction. Human civilization has led to environmental destruction and pollution significantly contributing to the ongoing mass extinction of other forms of life called the Holocene extinction event,* which may be further accelerated by global warming in the future.|$|E
500|$|Justice League: Alien Invasion 3D {{has been}} well received. Prior {{to the opening of}} the attraction, Tanya Westthorp of the Gold Coast Bulletin {{experienced}} a preview of the ride and stated afterwards that [...] "the unbelievably real 3D effects and sound, wind and heat blasts and falling walls made for an extremely immersive experience". Richard Wilson of Parkz commended the ride for its engaging theming and immersive storyline, but described Bertazzon's ride system as the biggest disappointment. Wilson concluded by stating, [...] "Justice League adds a new dimension to Warner Bros. Movie <b>World</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> been sorely missing".|$|E
500|$|In later years, Rilke’s Duino Elegies and the Sonnets to Orpheus {{influenced}} Hans-Georg Gadamer’s {{theories of}} hermeneutics—understanding how an observer (i.e. reader, listener, or viewer) interprets cultural artifacts (i.e. works of literature, music, or art) {{as a series}} of distinct encounters. [...] Gadamer, using examples of Rilke's poetry in his writings, interprets these works as an experience of a divine [...] "totality" [...] that we must approach with a childlike innocence and ignorance—that only through interpreting and reinterpreting can we cope with or solve the existential problems of humanity’s significance and impermanence. [...] Gadamer points out that man is in a condition influenced by an anonymous, alienated, and mechanical <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> evolved to stand as an obstacle to his ability to make sense of such experiences.|$|E

Mankind Divided forms part of a series-wide project dubbed the [...] "Deus Ex Universe", with both games and additional media designed to expand upon the series setting.|$|E

[...] Newspapers {{reported it}} was a [...] "serious attack" [...] and that he [...] "has been quite ill", but {{he was able to}} recuperate before the 1905 football season. [...] In October 1905, Coach Yost said: [...] "In looking over the whole bunch, I do not see anyone who has improved more than Schulz. [...] He is bigger and stronger than ever, and I do not know a man in the <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> it the least bit over him in the center position.

500|$|In 2013, {{the team}} had {{released}} Fuse, which was a critical and commercial failure. The team now reflected on the reasons for its poor reception, and felt that they {{should go back to}} Insomniac's roots — developing unusual titles with vibrant visuals — instead of another dark shooter like Fuse. They also thought that Sunset Overdrives stylization should reflect the personality of the company, and that building a <b>world</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> a sense of humor and irreverence was something the team was eager to do. Ted Price, CEO of Insomniac Games, described it as a game Insomniac had wanted to develop for a long time. The game's producer, Bryan Intihar, called it: [...] "...the game [...] been meaning to make for 20 years."
