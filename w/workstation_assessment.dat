The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the impact of a workplace exercise program on neck and shoulder pain and flexibility in office workers. The <b>workstation</b> <b>assessment</b> was performed using Rapid Office Strain Assessment. Workers were assessed for pain pre- and post-implementation of the workplace exercise program using the Nordic Questionnaire for Musculoskeletal Symptoms, and for flexibility. The program lasted 3 months and entailed twice weekly sessions. The sample consisted of an intervention group (n = 30) and a control group (n = 8). The results suggest improvements in pain reduction and increased flexibility. The workers had less musculoskeletal pain at the end of the evaluation. The increase in flexibility between the evaluations was significant in the intervention group, though there were slight improvements there too...|$|E

40|$|Carpet weaving is a {{high risk}} {{occupation}} for developing MSDs, as awkward working postures, repetitive movements, contact stress and long working time are common. The objectives of the present study, which was carried out at the Iranian hand-woven carpet industry, were determination of MSDs symptoms prevalence, workstation and working posture assessment, identification of major factors associated with MSDs symptoms in different body regions and developing guidelines for workstation design. In this study, 1439 randomly selected weavers from 9 Iranian provinces have participated. Data on personal details, workshop characteristics and MSDs symptoms was collected by questionnaire. Posture and <b>workstation</b> <b>assessment</b> were performed by observational technique. The results revealed that musculoskeletal symptoms prevalence rates in shoulders (47. 8 %), lower back (45. 2 %), wrists (38. 2 %), upper back (37. 7 %), neck (35. 2 %) and knees (34. 6 %) were high as compared to general Iranian population (for neck, back and large joints p< 0. 0001). Working postures {{were found to be}} deviated form neutral. Lack of proper seat, leg clearance, adjustment mechanisms, together with incorrect weaving height made weavers worked in constrained, harmful postures. The results were subjected to multivariate analyses in order to find the major factors associated with musculoskeletal symptoms. Several such factors were identified for symptoms of each body regions. Identified ergonomic factors were loom type, working posture, daily working time, seat type and type of knots. Based on the results, some general guidelines for weaving workstation design were developed. The prototype test showed that the new workstation was acceptable to subject tests and improved working posture...|$|E

40|$|Background: Patients with Parkinson's disease often {{suffer from}} reduced {{mobility}} due to impaired postural control. Balance exercises form {{an integral part}} of rehabilitative therapy but the effectiveness of existing interventions is limited. Recent technological advances allow for providing enhanced visual feedback in the context of computer games, which provide an attractive alternative to conventional therapy. The objective of this randomized clinical trial is to investigate whether a training program capitalizing on virtual-reality-based visual feedback is more effective than an equally-dosed conventional training in improving standing balance performance in patients with Parkinson's disease. Methods/design: Patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease will participate in a five-week balance training program comprising ten treatment sessions of 60 minutes each. Participants will be randomly allocated to (1) an experimental group that will receive balance training using augmented visual feedback, or (2) a control group that will receive balance training in accordance with current physical therapy guidelines for Parkinson's disease patients. Training sessions consist of task-specific exercises that are organized as a series of <b>workstations.</b> <b>Assessments</b> will take place before training, at six weeks, and at twelve weeks follow-up. The functional reach test will serve as the primary outcome measure supplemented by comprehensive assessments of functional balance, posturography, and electroencephalography. Discussion: We hypothesize that balance training based on visual feedback will show greater improvements on standing balance performance than conventional balance training. In addition, we expect that learning new control strategies will be visible in the co-registered posturographic recordings but also through changes in functional connectivity.

The {{introduction}} of computerized nursing information systems offers health care institutions {{an opportunity to take}} a new look at safety issues related to nursing workstation design. Industrial studies have investigated the injuries sustained by clerical workers who spend long periods of time at their computers. Cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs) are the most common injuries associated with computerized workstation use. They account for nearly 90, 000 injuries each year in the United States. Typical CTDs include back pain, strain of the neck, shoulders and eyes, and carpal tunnel syndrome. As the information handling work of nurses is increasingly computerized, the incidence of computer-related injury is expected to increase. Injury rates can be reduced by ergonomic <b>workstation</b> design. An <b>assessment</b> of potential risks associated with the equipment installed should be done as part of workstation design. Risk identification is a prerequisite for avoiding injuries by designing workstations that protect human health. The ergonomic principles learned and tested on office workers are addressed and extrapolated to nursing workstation design.

40|$|The {{automotive}} {{industry has been}} the focus of digital human modeling (DHM) research and application for many years. In the highly competitive marketplace for personal transportation, the desire to improve the customerâs experience has driven extensive research in both the physical and cognitive interaction between the vehicle and its occupants. Human models provide vehicle designers with tools to view and analyze product interactions before the first prototypes are built, potentially improving the design while reducing cost and development time. The focus of DHM research and applications began with prediction and representation of static postures for purposes of driver <b>workstation</b> layout, including <b>assessments</b> of seat adjustment ranges and exterior vision. Now DHMs are used for seat design and assessment of driver reach and ingress/egress. DHMs and related simulation tools are expanding into the cognitive domain, with computational models of perception and motion, and into the dynamic domain with models of physical responses to ride and vibration. Moreover, DHMs are now widely used to analyze the ergonomics of vehicle assembly tasks. In this case, the analysis aims to determine whether workers can be expected to complete the tasks safely and with good quality.

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} obtain {{information}} on athletic performance, strength and power characteristics of the athlete are generally evaluated. However, due to {{the large number of}} variables needed for the assessment, this kind of evaluations is usually time consuming. Taking advantage of recent developments in the area of sensors and acquisition systems and using signal processing algorithms reported in the literature, we developed a new Athletic Performance Evaluation System. This system automatically determines evaluation parameters and integrates them in ready-made reports, decreasing the time involved in the evaluation process. The system is based on the installation of sensors and wireless acquisition systems at the <b>assessment</b> <b>workstations</b> of a Sports Evaluation Laboratory. At present, Jump Platform, Leg Press and Multipower workstations are being used. Strength and displacement data collected by the sensors at these workstations is automatically processed in real time at the Central Base Station where standard force and power related evaluation parameters are determined. Graphical representations of time evolution of the variables being measured by the sensors are showed in real time on the screen. Each evaluation session is defined by a protocol that can be specifically created by the coach for each athlete. The results of the evaluations are stored in an athletes' database so that the historic performance of the athlete can be easily assessed. The resulting system presents the deployment of sound theoretical evaluation metrics in a real time athlete performance evaluation system. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScPhysio (Physiotherapy)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. INTRODUCTION Computer use {{has been}} {{identified}} as a risk factor for the development of musculoskeletal dysfunction among children and adolescents internationally. Computer exposure has increased in the Western Cape since 2002, with the inception of a project to install computer laboratories in all schools in the province. As musculoskeletal dysfunction experienced during adolescence is predictive of musculoskeletal disorders in adulthood, it is essential to identify all risk and/or associative factors. METHODOLOGY A descriptive study was conducted with the aim to investigate whether the musculoskeletal dysfunction of high school learners in the Cape Metropolitan region was related to their computer use. This study was conducted in two phases. Phase 1 of the study entailed the completion of a new questionnaire, the Computer Usage Questionnaire, by grade 10 - 12 learners. The learner sample was divided in a computer and a non-computer group depending on their exposure to the school computer. Phase 2 of the study involved the assessment of the ergonomic design of the computer laboratories at randomly selected high schools within the Cape Metropolitan region. RESULTS A total of 1073 learners (65 % girls & 35 % boys), aged 14 - 18 years, completed the CUQ in phase 1 of the study. The results indicated that learners in the computer group had greater weekly exposure to computers than the non-computer group. The prevalence of musculoskeletal dysfunction among this learner sample was 74 %. The most common body areas of dysfunction were the head, low back and neck. The female gender, playing sport and using the school computer {{for more than three years}} were associated with musculoskeletal dysfunction. Weekly computer use of more than seven hours was predictive of general musculoskeletal dysfunction, low back pain and neck pain. Twenty nine computer laboratories within 16 selected high schools were assessed by means of the Computer <b>Workstation</b> Design <b>Assessment</b> (CWDA). Out of a total score of 40, the computer laboratories obtained average scores of less than 45 %, indicating compliance with less than half of the standard ergonomic requirements. The average scores for the workspace environment was less than 40 %. The design of the desk, chair and computer screen had the poorest compliance to ergonomic guidelines. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION The prevalence of musculoskeletal dysfunction among this sample was higher than among other similar samples on the same study topic. The higher prevalence may be attributed to the poor ergonomic design of the computer laboratories in the Cape Metropolitan region. Learnersâ reduced participation in activities such as sport and working on a computer due to their musculoskeletal dysfunction, may impact on their choice of a future career. The tendency of learners not to seek medical advice for their musculoskeletal dysfunction may predispose the development of chronic musculoskeletal disorders. Education of related parties on safe computing habits as well as advice on the ergonomic design of computer laboratories is recommended to prevent the progression of adolescent musculoskeletal dysfunction into chronic disorders in adulthood...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Due to the {{inherent}} fire risk in occupancies, it necessary {{that they are}} provided with suitable and sufficient escape route in case of fire emergency. This will ensure that occupants can get {{to a place of}} relative safety within the shortest period of time without travelling excessive distances or encountering hindrances. This paper is resultant of a study conducted on fourteen commercial highrise buildings in Nairobi CBD. It assesses essential fire escape route elements {{in the light of the}} requirements of the national regulations, laws and standards. Inspections, questionnaire survey, document review and interviews were used in the research. One hundred and nine (109) occupants responded to the questions poised to capture their perception, attitude and opinion on the escape route/s at their <b>workstations.</b> In the <b>assessment</b> 85. 71 % of the surveyed escape routes exhibited insufficient or unsuitable fire elements while only 7. 14 % of the buildings had sufficient and/or suitable and 7. 14 % had no escape stairs at all. Further, the results of the study show that, although fire escape routes are required as an integral part of the fire safety strategy, there still exist deficiencies in their provision. Unclear or no exit signage, obstruction and locking; poor escape route planning, lack of alternative escape route and the condition of fire doors are some of the challenges found with escape routes in the buildings. In view of the results, escape routes should be adequate, easily accessible, properly marked, well lit and have in place requisite facilities to enable easy movement and safety of the people. The escape route should also be routinely inspected to ensure no inhibitions are found to prevent people from using the route effectively. Lastly, the responsible authorities and persons should make sure that inspections are done and records made on remedial actions undertaken to correct present hazardous situation/s.

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the organisational nature of the construction industry, and due to the dynamic nature of construction activities, construction workers are exposed to Work Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WRMSDs) risk factors as an intrinsic part of their daily activities. Plasterers are one of the trades that experience high prevalence rates of the disorders when compared with other trades within the industry. Consequently, the quality of their work is affected. Additionally, due to associated absenteeism and early retirement, and costs associated with treatment, compensation, and insurance costs, the plasterer, their employer, and the economy experience a significant financial burden. Upon developing a research risk assessment protocol, it was used as a guide to develop an assessment methodology to evaluate if plasterers working in Ireland were at an increased risk of developing WRMSDs because of their tasks and working conditions. Psychophysical, physiological, and biomechanical assessment methods were selected based on their suitability to evaluate WRMSD risk. Visual Analogue Discomfort Scales (VADS) was used to evaluate psychophysical stress; Heart Rate Analysis (HRA) was used to evaluate physiological stress, and Electromyography (EMG) was used to evaluate biomechanical stress [...] The VADS survey consisted of 100 mm linear scales, a body map and questionnaires. It was used as an assessment method on active construction sites to measure subjective qualitative judgments of postural discomfort to determine if plasterers experienced discomfort {{over the course of a}} working day and working week. Further analysis of the VADS data was carried out to evaluate if the type of work being carried out, and the type of conditions plasterers worked in, influenced levels of discomfort intensity. Additionally, it was used to provide a snapshot representation of the type of work being carried out, and the type of conditions plasterers work in over a five-day work period. The dependent unit of psychophysical response is intensity of discomfort represented as a measure of millimetres ranging from 0 - 100 mm. Eighteen plasterers participated in the VADS study. HRA and EMG were used to evaluate plasterersÃÂ¿ responses when carrying out a plastering activity in four simulated working environments. Each environment was set up to represent combinations of independent variables - standing surfaces (e. g. ground, stilts, trestle, and hop-up), plastering surfaces (e. g. wall and ceiling), plastering tasks (e. g. Mix Plaster, Load Mortarboard, Load Hawk, Load Trowel and Plaster), and mortarboard stand heights (e. g. 775 mm and 1270 mm). HRA was used to evaluate and compare each plastererÃÂ¿s physiological response when they carried out a wet-plastering task in each of the four <b>assessment</b> <b>workstations.</b> The dependant variables of physiological response were mean heart rate (bpm), Heart Rate Zone (HRZ) activity, Relative Heart Rate (RHR) and Recommended Rest Period (RRP). EMG analysis was used to evaluate muscle activity levels to evaluate the plasterersÃÂ¿ biomechanical response of for each for each sub-task for each variable condition. The muscles assessed were the right and left sternocleidomastoid muscles in the neck, right and left trapezius muscles in the shoulder, and the right and left erector spinae muscles in the back. The dependent variable of biomechanical response was mean/maximum muscle activity level represented as a percentage of peak muscle activity. Statistical analysis was carried out to describe details about aspects of the sample population and compare independent variables with dependent variables. The results indicate that in most cases independent variables significantly influences change in the dependent variables and plastering activities and working conditions increase plasterersÃÂ¿ risk of developing WRMSDs. For example, in the VADS study (psychophysical analysis) it was found that plasterers experienced an increase in perceived discomfort intensity levels over five consecutive workdays. A decline in intensity levels was observed after a period of rest i. e. lunch break or overnight break. In the HRA study (physiological analysis), plasterers experienced the highest physiological stress when carrying out a wet-plastering activity on a wall while standing on the ground and a hop-up, and using a low mortarboard stand. When working on ceiling, plasterers experienced their lowest physiological stress when standing on stilts and using a high mortarboard stand. In the EMG study (biomechanical analysis), activity levels were highest when plasterers worked on a ceiling when compared with working on a wall. The neck muscles had the highest activity level when standing on a trestle, whereas the shoulder and back muscles had the highest activity levels when standing on the ground. The neck, shoulder, and back muscles had the highest activity levels when tasks were carried out when using the low mortarboard stand. The findings from the data analysis were used to provide recommendations for control interventions to minimise the adverse effects that the plastering task and working conditions has on the musculoskeletal system and decrease the probability of plasterers developing WRMSDs...|$|R
