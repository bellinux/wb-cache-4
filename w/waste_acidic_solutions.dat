40|$|Waste waters {{produced}} and disposed of at modern mine sites are problematic because they contain hazardous substances (e. g. heavy metals, metalloids, acids, process chemicals), and therefore require treatment before disposing to the environment. Three {{different kinds of}} mine waters are identified depending on their chemical composition and pH. They are acidic mine waters, alkaline mine waters and neutral mine waters. Acidic mine waters are of interest because they have greater environmental hazards compared to others. Other <b>acidic</b> <b>waste</b> <b>solutions</b> also considered are waste streams from mineral processing plants and smelter sites. The current approaches to manage <b>acidic</b> <b>waste</b> <b>solutions</b> includes, neutralization, flocculation, filtration and bioremediation. However, acid and water recovery using current technologies has not proven to be viable as most of these processes fail to produce sufficient volume and quality of water whereas others do not provide the selectivity necessary to create valuable product streams suitable for recycle or re-use. In these processes, the by-product sludge can itself become a disposal problem. Therefore a novel approach to acid and water recovery are needed to improve the sustainability of the mining industry. The objective {{of this study is}} to explore the possibility for the novel combination of two technologies, membrane distillation (MD) and solvent extraction (SX) for water and acid recovery. The focus is the testing on acid and water recovery from industry spent acid streams and <b>acidic</b> mine <b>wastes</b> <b>solutions</b> and also modelling of the economic opportunities for MD to understand its cost sensitivities, in particular in the context of a carbon tax benchmarked against its more well-known application in seawater desalination...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{efforts at}} the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP) have {{included}} evaluation of cesium removal technologies {{as applied to}} ICPP <b>acidic</b> radioactive <b>waste</b> streams. Ammonium molybdophosphate (AMP) immobilized on a polyacrylonitrile support (AMP-PAN) has been studied as an ion exchange agent for cesium removal from <b>acidic</b> <b>waste</b> <b>solutions.</b> Capacities, distribution coefficients, elutability, and kinetics of cesium-extraction have been evaluated. Exchange breakthrough curves using small columns have been determined from 1 M HNO{sub 3 } and simulated waste solutions. The theoretical capacity of AMP is 213 g Cs/kg AMP. The average experimental capacity in batch contacts with various <b>acidic</b> <b>solutions</b> was 150 g Cs/kg AMP. The measured cesium distribution coefficients from actual waste solutions were 3287 mL/g for dissolved zirconia calcines, and 2679 mL/g for sodium-bearing waste. The cesium in the dissolved alumina calcines was analyzed for; however, the concentration was below analytical detectable limits resulting in inconclusive results. The reaction kinetics are very rapid (2 - 10 minutes). Cesium absorption appears to be independent of acid concentration over the range tested (0. 1 M to 5 M HNO{sub 3 }) ...|$|R

From the variations in the pH {{as a function of}} total solids addition to <b>acidic</b> <b>waste</b> effluent <b>solutions,</b> the stages of gellation, liquefaction, slurry formation and grout development are quantitatively revealed. Experimental results indicate the completion of these reaction steps to be significant for elimination of bleed liquid and for setting of the grout to a dimensionally stable and hardened solid within a reasonable period of about twenty eight days that is often observed in the cement and concrete industry. The reactions also suggest increases in the waste loading in the direction of decreasing acid molarity. Consequently, 1. 0 molar SBW- 180 waste is contained in higher quantity than the 2. 8 molar SBW- 189, given the same grout formulation for both effluents.

40|$|A {{large amount}} of <b>acidic</b> <b>waste</b> <b>solution</b> is {{generated}} from the practical electrokinetic decontamination equipments for the remediation of soil contaminated with uranium. After filtration of uranium hydroxides formed by adding CaO into the waste solution, the filtrate was recycled {{in order to reduce}} the volume of waste solution. However, when the filtrate was used in an electrokinetic equipment, the low permeability of the filtrate from anode cell to cathode cell due to a high concentration of calcium made several problems such as the weakening of a fabric tamis, the corrosion of electric wire and the adhension of metallic oxides to the surface of cathode electrode. To solve these problems, sulfuric acid was added into the filtrate and calcium in the solution was removed as CaSO 4 precipi-tate. A decontamination test using a small electrokinetic equipment for 20 days indicated that Ca-removed waste solution decreased uranium concentration of the waste soil to 0. 35 Bq/g, which is a similar to a decontaminatio...|$|R
40|$|Chemical Sludge Removal (CSR) is {{the final}} waste removal {{activity}} planned {{for some of the}} oldest nuclear waste tanks located at the Savannah River Site (SRS) in Aiken, SC. In 2008, CSR will be used to empty two of these waste tanks in preparation for final closure. The two waste tanks chosen to undergo this process have previously leaked small amounts of nuclear waste from the primary tank into an underground secondary containment pan. CSR involves adding aqueous oxalic acid to the waste tank in order to dissolve the remaining sludge heel.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the loss of gallium (Ga) and arsenic (As) loss during the {{sedimentation}} of gallium arsenate (GaAsO 4) from waste solutions of GaAs epitaxial production by chloride method. The solid wastes of this semiconductor manufacturing process are removed from technological equipment by dissolution in an <b>acidic</b> etching <b>solution.</b> In order to recover valuable Ga and very toxic As from these waste solutions we proposed to precipitate them as gallium arsenate. Experiments have been conducted to determine the migration of the two elements in filtrate and washing solutions as a function of pH for both model and real industrial wastes. It has been determined the optimal interval of pH for sedimentation, the losses of Ga and As present 0, 01 - 0, 053 %. For model solutions the sedimentation is optimal in the range of pH from 3, 2 to 4, 3, while in the case of real waste solution this interval is 3, 6 - 5, 0. Comparative evaluation of the precipitation efficiency revealed that for model solutions the arsenic loss during the precipitation is higher (0, 5 %), and this can be explained by a different ratio of initial Ga 3 + and AsO 43 - in model and real solutions. The results described in this paper provide important guidelines for the sedimentation of gallium arsenate from <b>acidic</b> <b>waste</b> <b>solutions</b> and indicate an overall efficiency of the process that could lead to savings in cost and process time for industrial effluent treatment technologies...|$|R
40|$|Aqueous {{chloride}} {{operations at}} the Los Alamos Plutonium Facility cannot directly dispose of <b>acidic</b> <b>waste</b> <b>solutions</b> because of compatibility problems with existing disposal lines. Consequently, all hydrochloric acid must be neutralized and filtered prior to exiting the facility. From a waste minimization standpoint, the use of spent magnesia pyrochemical crucibles as the acid neutralization agent is attractive since this process would take a stream destined for transuranic waste {{and use it as}} a reagent in routine plutonium residue processing. Since Los Alamos National Laboratory has several years of experience using magnesium hydroxide as a neutralizing agent for waste acid from plutonium processing activities, the use of spent magnesia pyrochemical crucibles appeared to be an attractive extension of this activity. In order to be competitive with magnesium hydroxide, however, size reduction of crucible shards had to be performed effectively within the constraints of glovebox operations, and acid neutralization time using crucible shards had to be comparable to neutralization times observed when using reagent-grade magnesium hydroxide. The study utilized non-plutonium-contaminated crucibles for equipment evaluation and selection and used nonradioactive acid solutions for completing the neutralization experiments. This paper discusses experience in defining appropriate size reduction equipment and presents results from using the magnesia crucibles for hydrochloric acid neutralization, a logical precursor to introduction into glovebox enclosures...|$|R

The sorbed metal ions could be efficiently desorbed with a complexing solution containing guanidine carbonate and EDTA buffer. The sorption of Am(III) on both resins followed pseudo-second order rate kinetics with rate constants of 1. 37 × 10 − 6 and 6. 88 × 10 − 7 g/cpm min for T-DGA and C 4 DGA resins, respectively. The metal sorption on both resins indicated the Langmuir monolayer chemisorption phenomenon with Eu(III) sorption capacities of 4. 83 ± 0. 21 and 0. 52 ± 0. 05 mg per g of T-DGA and C 4 DGA resins, respectively.

40|$|Several calix[4]arene-functionalized diglycolamide (C 4 DGA) ligands were {{evaluated}} for the extraction {{as well as}} supported liquid membrane (SLM) transport of actinides and fission product elements from nitric acid feed solutions. The extraction efficiency of the C 4 DGA ligands for Am(III) was orders of magnitude {{higher than that of}} the commonly proposed diglycolamide ligand, TODGA (N,N,N’,N’-tetra-n-octyl diglycolamide). The extraction efficiency of Am(III) with C 4 DGA increased with increasing the alkyl chain length attached to the N atom of the DGA moieties closer to the calix[4]arene platform. The facilitated transport of metal ions through SLM containing the C 4 DGA ligands followed the efficiency: Am(III) ∼Eu(III) ∼Np(IV) >Pu(IV) ⪢ U(VI) >Sr(II) >Cs(I). The permeability coefficient (P) and diffusion coefficient (Do) values for the transported species were calculated. A mathematical model was developed to predict the transport of Am(III) through the SLM, which was successfully verified with the experimental results. The model describes the membrane flux over a wide range of feed composition, chemical composition of metal–ligand complex and revealed that the membrane diffusion processes mainly controls the membrane permeability under different experimental conditions.

40|$|Pickling {{is one of}} the key {{steps in}} metal {{finishing}} industries, where HCl solutions are largely used thus generating significant amounts of spent waste solutions containing high concentrations of metals and acid. The recovery of acid from such waste solutions is thus one of the most beneficial steps for reducing the environmental and economical impact of these processes. Among several separation methods, diffusion dialysis (DD) is becoming more and more attractive thanks to the recent important advances in ion exchange membranes (IEMs) field and because of its clean nature and operational simplicity, low installation and operating costs and low energy consumption [1, 2]. In the present work, a single-cell diffusion dialysis module equipped with a FumaTech Anion Exchange Membrane (AEM), operated in a batch mode, has been employed in order to study the effect of some parameters on the efficiency of HCl recovery from <b>waste</b> pickling <b>acidic</b> <b>solutions.</b> In addition, a mathematical model, capable of simulate and predict this process, has been also developed and validated with experimental information. The laboratory test-rig and procedures have been first evaluated and optimised by measuring salt and water fluxes with artificial NaCl solutions with different types of AEMs. Then, experiments with HCl solutions were carried out, at different compositions of diffusate and retentate streams, varying HCl concentration values in the range of 0. 1 - 3 M. HCl and water osmotic fluxes were measured and their dependence on operating conditions was identified. Also the effect of the presence of selected iron salts were investigated in order to simulate the operation of the system when treating actual pickling solutions. In particular, the acid diffusion permeability as well as the water osmotic permeability tend to increase when increasing the solution concentration. In addition, an increasing HCl recovery is detected in the presence of iron chloride.
