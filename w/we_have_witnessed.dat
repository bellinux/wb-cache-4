500|$|... "Road to Germany" [...] {{received}} positive reviews. Ahsan Haque of IGN {{rated the}} episode 9.6 saying, [...] "Featuring gorgeous CGI animation, a genuinely exciting storyline, and some hilariously offensive humor, this Stewie and Brian centric episode of Family Guy easily {{stands out as}} one of the best episodes of the show in years." [...] Alex Rocha of TV Guide was much more critical stating, [...] "it seemed that the show has taken a slight fall back. After having great episodes the past few weeks to get this current season started on a roll, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> another average, even sub-par episode." [...] In his review of Family Guy, volume 7, Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk called the episode [...] "hugely memorable", and stated that it [...] "features some of the finest animation the series has ever produced".|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert added Ugetsu to his Great Movies list in 2004, {{calling it}} [...] "one of the {{greatest}} of all films", and said that [...] "At the end of Ugetsu, aware we have seen a fable, we also feel curiously as if <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> true lives and fates". Director Martin Scorsese has also listed it as one of his favourite films of all time. In 5001 Nights at the Movies, film critic Pauline Kael found it to be [...] "subtle, violent yet magical", and termed Ugetsu as [...] "one of the most amazing of the Japanese movies that played American art houses". [...] In 2000, The Village Voice newspaper ranked Ugetsu 29th on their list of the 100 best films of the 20th century. Ugetsu has a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with the site's critical consensus stating, [...] "With its thought-provoking themes, rich atmosphere, and brilliant direction, Kenji Mizoguchi's [...] is a towering classic of world cinema".|$|E
2500|$|Writing in the American Jewish Congress' Congress Bi-Weekly in 1973, the Foreign Minister of Israel, Abba Eban, {{identified}} anti-Zionism as ‘the new anti-Semitism’, saying:"ecently <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> {{the rise}} of the new left which identifies Israel with the establishment, with acquisition, with smug satisfaction, with, in fact, all the basic enemies … Let there be no mistake: the new left is the author and the progenitor of the new anti-Semitism. One of the chief tasks of any dialogue with the Gentile world is to prove that the distinction between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism is not a distinction at all. Anti-Zionism is merely the new anti-Semitism. The old classic anti-Semitism declared that equal rights belong to all individuals within the society, except the Jews. The new anti-Semitism says that the right to establish and maintain an independent national sovereign state is the prerogative of all nations, so long as they happen not to be Jewish. And when this right is exercised not by the Maldive Islands, not by the state of Gabon, not by Barbados… but by the oldest and most authentic of all nationhoods, then this is said to be exclusivism, particularism, and a flight of the Jewish people from its universal mission." ...|$|E
60|$|Returning to Borabolla's, much {{conversation}} ensued, {{concerning the}} sad scene <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>witnessed,</b> which presently branched into a learned discussion upon matters of surgery at large.|$|R
5000|$|Desmond Lim, Chairman of Singapore Democratic Alliance, {{said that}} Lee [...] "had no doubt, with his comrades, had sic brought and push Singapore from {{third world country}} to what we enjoy now-first world state sic. This is {{something}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>witnessed</b> and cannot be denied.|$|R
60|$|Within six {{and thirty}} hours after <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{returned}} from the pursuit matters were so far straightened that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> nothing save ordinary garrison duty to perform, and we lounged around discussing the exciting and mysterious events which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>witnessed,</b> until I dare venture to say that every man was absolutely weary with so much tongue-wagging.|$|R
6000|$|... "If this be true, as I doubt not, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> a great act of justice, {{though it}} bore a {{different}} aspect. But wherefore in this presence? wherefore with thine own hand?" ...|$|E
60|$|In our own days <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> {{the rapid}} {{creation}} of a new metropolitan quarter, built solely for the aristocracy by an aristocrat. The Belgrave district is as monotonous as Mary-le-bone; and is so contrived as to be at the same time insipid and tawdry.|$|E
60|$|The {{criticism}} and attack on institutions, which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>witnessed,</b> has made one thing plain, that society gains nothing whilst a man, not himself renovated, attempts to renovate things around him: {{he has become}} tediously good in some particular but negligent or narrow in the rest; and hypocrisy and vanity are often the disgusting result.|$|E
60|$|Generously entertained, we tarried in this land; till at length, {{from over}} the Lagoon, came full tidings of the {{eruption}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>witnessed</b> in Franko, with many details. The conflagration had spread through Porpheero and the kings were {{to and fro}} hunted, like malefactors by blood-hounds; all that part of Mardi was heaving with throes.|$|R
6000|$|It {{always seemed}} {{to me as if}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>witnessed</b> {{something}} like the return of one from the dead, in this meeting. We were talking it over one evening some weeks later, and [...] "It would be all very well," [...] I philosophized, [...] "if the dead came back at once, but if one came back after ten years, it would be difficult." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{remained}} at Kadabra, the guests of Talu, until after his formal induction into office, and then, upon the great fleet which I {{had been so}} fortunate to preserve from destruction, we sailed south across the ice-barrier; but not before <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>witnessed</b> the total demolition of the grim Guardian of the North under orders of the new Jeddak of Jeddaks.|$|R
60|$|Messer Naldo {{came again}} sooner than was expected: {{he came on}} the evening of the twenty-eighth of November, only eleven days after his {{previous}} visit, proving that he had not gone far beyond the mountains; and a scene which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> as it took place that evening in the Via de' Bardi may help to explain the impulse which turned his steps towards the hill of San Giorgio.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{talk about}} love," [...] said the Philosopher, [...] "as {{though it were}} a known quantity. After all, to say that a man loves is like saying that he paints or plays the violin; it conveys no meaning until <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> his performance. Yet to hear the subject discussed, one might imagine the love of a Dante or a society Johnny, of a Cleopatra or a Georges Sand, to be {{precisely}} the same thing." ...|$|E
60|$|When we come {{to examine}} in detail what is the sane mind in the sane body, the final test of {{completeness}} {{seems to be a}} security of distinction between what we have professed and what we have done; what we have aimed at and what we have achieved; what we have invented and what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> or had evidenced to us; what we think and feel in the present and what we thought and felt in the past.|$|E
6000|$|Old Morton (signing). Alexander Morton, sen. There, Aleck! You have {{forgotten}} one legal formality. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> no <b>witness.</b> Ha, <b>ha!</b> ...|$|R
60|$|We hastened {{back to the}} Christian {{village with}} {{feelings}} of the deepest sadness at the sanguinary conflict which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> just <b>witnessed.</b>|$|R
60|$|Horrified, sick at heart, we {{continued}} our journey. No {{wonder that the}} Khania hated such a mad despot. And this woman {{was in love with}} Leo, and this lunatic Khan, her husband, was a victim to jealousy, which he avenged after the very unpleasant fashion that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>witnessed.</b> Truly an agreeable prospect for all of us! Yet, I could not help reflecting, as an object lesson that horrid scene had its advantages.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fellow-scientists, it is {{my belief}} that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> a thing which has {{occurred}} in perfection but once before in the knowledge of created beings. It is a phenomenon of inconceivable importance and interest, view it as one may, but its interest to us is vastly heightened by an added knowledge of its nature which no scholar has heretofore possessed or even suspected. This great marvel which we have just witnessed, fellow-savants (it almost takes my breath away), {{is nothing less than}} the transit of Venus!" ...|$|E
60|$|Lest {{the reader}} {{should be at}} any loss to {{discover}} the cause of Miss Miggs's deep emotion, it may be whispered apart that, happening to be listening, as her custom sometimes was, when Gabriel and his wife conversed together, she had heard the locksmith's joke relative to the foreign black who played the tambourine, and bursting with the spiteful feelings which the taunt awoke in her fair breast, exploded in the manner <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>witnessed.</b> Matters having now arrived at a crisis, the locksmith, as usual, {{and for the sake}} of peace and quietness, gave in.|$|E
6000|$|... "Early {{travelers}} in Persia and India {{have reported}} things they saw far surpassing any <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> this evening, {{and there is}} certainly a sect in India at present, or rather a body of men, and those, as far as I have been able to learn, of an exceptionally intelligent class, who believe that they possess an almost absolute mastery over the powers of nature. You see, fifty years back, if anyone had talked about traveling at fifty miles an hour, or sending a message five thousand miles in a minute, he would have been regarded as a madman. There may yet be other discoveries as startling to be made.|$|E
500|$|The band's defense {{attorney}} Steve Graham {{spoke on the}} incident claiming, [...] "There is another side to this. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>witnesses</b> that can testify {{to the fact that}} the accuser came to visit band of her own free will and left on good terms." [...] He also told police that the band members had offered to surrender but never heard anything back, [...] "I made it clear that I could get the guys up here ASAP and they would cooperate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Also <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>witness,</b> as weel in holy writt as in profane history, of the honour in quhilk husbandrie {{was held}} of old, and how prophets {{have been taken}} from the pleugh, and great captains raised up to defend their ain countries, sic as Cincinnatus, and the like, who fought not the common enemy with the less valiancy that their alms had been {{exercised}} in halding the stilts of the pleugh, and their bellicose skill in driving of yauds and owsen.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a wild}} {{pleasure}} in viewing a town in such an extraordinary state, and I could not help comparing its present moody silence, to the scenes <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>witnessed</b> when the government was still so young and dependent as to feel the necessity of courting the people. I have already mentioned to you many {{of the events of}} that period, but some of them have been omitted, and some, too, which quite naturally suggest themselves, at this moment, when the King has established military tribunals in his very capital.|$|R
60|$|The {{peculiar}} evil to be apprehended is, {{that the}} high money price of labour may diminish the demand for it; {{and that it has}} this tendency will be readily allowed, particularly as it tends to increase the prices of exportable commodities. But repeated experience has shown us that such tendencies are continually counterbalanced, and more than counterbalanced by other circumstances. And <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>witnessed,</b> in our own country, a greater and more rapid extension of foreign commerce, than perhaps was ever known, under the apparent disadvantage of a very great increase in the price of corn and labour, compared with the prices of surrounding countries.|$|E
6000|$|It {{is in his}} stupendous Section, headed Natural Supernaturalism, {{that the}} Professor first becomes a Seer; and, after long effort, such as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>witnessed,</b> finally subdues under his feet this {{refractory}} Clothes-Philosophy, and takes victorious possession thereof. Phantasms enough {{he has had to}} struggle with; [...] "Cloth-webs and Cob-webs," [...] of Imperial Mantles, Superannuated Symbols, and what not: yet still did he courageously pierce through. Nay, worst of all, two quite mysterious, world-embracing Phantasms, TIME and SPACE, have ever hovered round him, perplexing and bewildering: but with these also he now resolutely grapples, these also he victoriously rends asunder. In a word, he has looked fixedly on Existence, till, one after the other, its earthly hulls and garnitures have all melted away; and now, to his rapt vision, the interior celestial Holy-of-Holies lies disclosed.|$|E
6000|$|From {{this point}} of view, {{it appears to me}} that it would be but a poor way of celebrating the Coming of Age of the [...] "Origin of Species," [...] were I merely to dwell upon the facts, undoubted and {{remarkable}} as they are, of its far-reaching influence and of the great following of ardent disciples who are occupied in spreading and developing its doctrines. Mere insanities and inanities have before now swollen to portentous size in the course of twenty years. Let us rather ask this prodigious change in opinion to justify itself: let us inquire whether anything has happened since 1859, which will explain, on rational grounds, why so many are worshipping that which they burned, and burning that which they worshipped. It is only in this way that we shall acquire the means of judging whether the movement <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> is a mere eddy of fashion, or truly one with the irreversible current of intellectual progress, and, like it, safe from retrogressive reaction.|$|E
40|$|The {{e-commerce}} {{company has}} been analyzed as a distinct organizational form {{in terms of its}} higher dependence to the external environment. By taking a prospective stand, alternative ways of viewing this high dependency have been examined from the resource dependence and the population ecology perspectives. The two theories exhibit an interesting contrast in their assessment of the impact of vertical integration on the future of e-commerce companies. The groundbreaking impact of information technology <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>witnessing</b> recently could not have been foreseen even a decade ago. Futurist studies in the previous decade were expecting that field...|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} time <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been <b>witnessing</b> the {{progressing}} Eurasian integration processes based on economic integration.

40|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> now <b>witnessed</b> {{more than}} half a decade of {{relatively}} heavy capital inflows to a large group of highly heterogeneous developing countries and economies in transition in Asia, Eastern Europe, the Former Soviet Union, Latin America, and parts of Africa and the Middle East [...] <b>we</b> <b>have</b> also <b>witnessed</b> the broad range of policy responses that these inflows have elicited. In light of this, the aim of this paper is threefold: first, we take stock of which countries implemented which policies; second, we attempt to assess to what extent the policies achieved their intended objectives; lastly, we draw lessons about which policies appear to have been the most successful tool in coping with surging capital inflows, with emphasis on the "policy mix" and how they interact. ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{the silent}} gentry who brew our Chartreuse; {{what are they}} in {{retirement}} for? Looking back into history, with the glow of discovery in my eyes, I find records of wise men--everyone acknowledged they were wise men--who lived apart. In every age the same associate of solitude, silence, and wisdom. The holy hermits!... I grant it, they professed to flee wickedness and seek after righteousness, but now {{my impression is that}} they fled bothers. We all know they had an intense aversion to any savour of domesticity, and they never shaved, washed, dined, visited, had new clothes. Holiness, indeed! They were viveurs.... <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> Religion without Theology, and why not an Unsectarian Thebaid? I sometimes fancy it needs only one brave man to begin.... If {{it were not for the}} fuss Euphemia would make I certainly should. But I know she would come and worry me worse than St. Anthony was worried until I put them all on again, and that keeps me from the attempt.|$|E
6000|$|The {{shock of}} Judge Pyncheon's death had a {{permanently}} invigorating and ultimately beneficial effect on Clifford. That strong and ponderous {{man had been}} Clifford's nightmare. There was no free breath to be drawn, within the sphere of so malevolent an influence. The first effect of freedom, as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>witnessed</b> in Clifford's aimless flight, was a tremulous exhilaration. Subsiding from it, he did not sink into his former intellectual apathy. He never, it is true, attained to nearly the full measure {{of what might have}} been his faculties. But he recovered enough of them partially to light up his character, to display some outline of the marvellous grace that was abortive in it, and to make him the object of no less deep, although less melancholy interest than heretofore. He was evidently happy. [...] Could we pause to give another picture of his daily life, with all the appliances now at command to gratify his instinct for the Beautiful, the garden scenes, that seemed so sweet to him, would look mean and trivial in comparison.|$|E
60|$|In {{the course}} of the last thirty years we have seen two wars waged against Liberty--the American war, and the war against the French People in the early stages of their Revolution. In the latter {{instance}} the Emigrants and the Continental Powers and the British did, in all their expectations and in every movement of their efforts, manifest a common ignorance--originating in the same source. And, for what more especially belongs to ourselves at this time, we may affirm--that the same presumptuous irreverence of the principles of justice, and blank insensibility to the affections of human nature, which determined the conduct of our government in those two wars against liberty, have continued to accompany its exertions in the present struggle for liberty,--and have rendered them fruitless. The British government deems (no doubt), on its own part, that its intentions are good. It must not deceive itself: nor must we deceive ourselves. Intentions--thoroughly good--could not mingle with the unblessed actions which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>witnessed.</b> A disinterested and pure intention is a light that guides as well as cheers, and renders desperate lapses impossible.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Blake {{has also}} written to Sergeant Cuff; and I have sent a line to Miss Verinder. With these, and with old Betteredge (who is really a person of {{importance}} in the family) <b>we</b> shall <b>have</b> <b>witnesses</b> enough for the purpose--without including Mrs. Merridew, if Mrs. Merridew persists in sacrificing herself to {{the opinion of the}} world.|$|R
5000|$|Fau's widow, Camille Fau, filed a {{wrongful}} death {{lawsuit against the}} four employees, two of whom died before the case went to trial. On January 13, 2003, {{after two days of}} deliberations, jurors found that the bouncers were not liable in Fau's death. According to testimony, just over 30 minutes had passed from the time the fight was stopped to the time the club employees arrived at a hospital for treatment of their broken hands. The jury felt that there was not enough time for a second beating to have taken place during that 30-minute period. Fau's attorney, disappointed with the verdict, said, [...] "We <b>had</b> <b>witnesses</b> that were intimidated. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>witnesses</b> who didn't show up. It just shows that the ongoing criminal activity of employees of the Crazy Horse Too is a lot more far-reaching than they would like people to believe." ...|$|R
