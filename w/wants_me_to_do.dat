6000|$|... "Each <b>wants</b> <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{the other}} good," [...] thought Kate; {{and she was}} so much touched and pleased that she {{did not know what to}} do, and looked foolish.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Woodburn {{advanced}} {{and put her}} hand on her father's shoulder. [...] "Look heah, papa! Mr. Fulkerson wants to ask you something, and he <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it fo' him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What <b>do</b> you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> <b>Do</b> you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> stay at {{home and}} read the Bible?' her {{companion}} demanded with an effect of profanity, confronted with her deep seriousness.|$|R
6000|$|... "One day Spotkirk came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{and told}} <b>me</b> he <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{a piece of}} {{business}} for him, for which he would pay me twenty-five dollars. I was glad to hear this, for I was greatly in need of money, and I asked him what it was he <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... "It's this," [...] she said. [...] "I don't seem to {{understand}} it. He <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something--but I can't think, and my eyes feel funny. Read it to me, please." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, madam, what is {{to become}} of the sewing Mrs. Tolbridge <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> I have only hemmed two of the dozen napkins she gave me to do day before yesterday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I owe my {{life and}} my {{bringing}} up to his father. He <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. His heart is set upon my helping Jack to become a man.... Dad loves me, and I love him. I must stand by him. I must repay him. It is my duty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! Then in {{this case}} of sweet and generous {{friendship}} {{the party of the}} second part may have construed the sentiment quite differently! Well, what <b>do</b> you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> <b>Do</b> you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> take the contract off your hands?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Maxwell {{shook his}} head. [...] "He doesn't mean this {{any more than}} he meant to revise the thing himself. He {{probably}} finds that he can't do that, and <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. But if I did it he might take it off after the first night in Chicago if the notices were unfavorable." ...|$|E
6000|$|COLONEL. Yes, yes! [Speaking in a {{surprised}} voice.] I don't know what I 'm talking like this for! It's your aunt! She goes on at me till she gets on my nerves. What d' {{you think she}} <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> now? Put money into this gold mine! Did you ever hear such folly? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{because you}} don't know that I am now doing {{business}} with your father. Yes, I am in fact doing exactly what he <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I've broken my promise to you. That's {{the sort of man}} I am. And now--aren't you afraid? If you believe what that dear, kind, truthful old lady says you ought to be." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was taken}} aback. I {{reflected}} that I had only seen him once. I {{did not know}} what she <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{asked in}} her coaxing way, kissing {{me as she}} used <b>to</b> <b>do</b> at school when she <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} for her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Get up!' said Mrs. Bumble, in a {{voice of}} command. 'And take {{yourself}} away from here, unless you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something desperate.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know as {{you ought}} to do that--but I'd like you to do it. I'd {{like to have the}} chance to go away--far away--and strike out fresh. My father <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it--he's written me three letters about it. He wants me to go to the Hawaiian Islands, or the Philippines, or to Australia. He says--but I don't suppose you are {{interested}} in what he writes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Amy, as if {{she wished}} to be convinced; 'but if he would only leave off saying his opinion has never altered, I think I could bring myself to look on him as Guy <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Good night! dear Laura, and don't be unhappy. Oh! one thing I must tell you; Guy made Charles promise to do all he could {{not to let it}} be a hasty letter. Now, good night!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} confess something," [...] {{she finally said}} with a little laugh. [...] "I hate to keep house. I hate to sew, and I can't marry a man who <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the way other women do. I must be {{intended}} for something else than a housewife, because I never do a bit of cooking or sewing without groaning. I like to paint fences and paper walls; but I'm {{not in the least}} domestic." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh she didn't <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it--the day I {{went with}} him, the day I told him. She tried to prevent me," [...] Francie insisted.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tell on,' said he, {{when the}} girl had put a spray bearing three {{blossoms}} into his buttonhole. 'Is it anything you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this afternoon?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I was," [...] said Mary sulkily. [...] "And as for practice, I don't suppose he'll <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more of {{that than}} {{anything}} else." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{suspected}} {{what was}} the matter readily enough. But it is a maxim of mine that men (being superior creatures) are bound to improve women--if they can. When a woman <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything (my daughter, or not, it doesn't matter), I always insist on knowing why. The oftener you make them rummage their own minds for a reason, the more manageable you will find them in all the relations of life. It isn't their fault (poor wretches!) that they act first and think afterwards; it's the fault of the fools who humour them.|$|E
6000|$|The {{note was}} from the Squire, sealed with his big seal (the Squire always sealed his letters in the old-fashioned way), and {{contained}} an invitation to himself to shoot on the morrow. [...] "George <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a little partridge driving," [...] it ended, [...] "and to brush through {{one or two of}} the small coverts. There will only be Colonel Quaritch besides yourself and George, but I hope that you will have a fair rough day. If I don't hear from you I shall suppose that you are coming, so don't trouble to write." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{house of}} the alcalde, Don Luis Zamora, he says, has a patio, of course--a kind of inner {{courtyard}} opening from the street. In an angle of it is his daughter's window--as dark a place as you could find. And {{what do you think}} he <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> Why, knowing my freedom, charm, and skilfulness of tongue, he proposes that I go into the patio at midnight, when the hobgoblin face of me cannot be seen, and make love to her for him--for the pretty man that she has seen on the plaza, thinking him to be Don Judson Tate.|$|E
6000|$|DICK. I'm {{not going}} to stay and worry you. You ought to rest. Only, Joy! Look here! If you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} for you, any time---- ...|$|R
6000|$|For once Lenore did not scold Kathleen, but {{drew her}} close and whispered: [...] "Do you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> please <b>me?</b> <b>Do</b> you <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{everything}} for you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{did have}} it wouldn't do you any good, Miss Dora. I've got <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{as the men}} folks <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> If I don't they'll make--" ...|$|R
6000|$|In this commonplace chatter, {{which lasted}} some time, the {{original}} subject seemed entirely forgotten; and though Catherine {{was very well}} pleased to have it dropped for a while, she could not avoid a little suspicion at the total suspension of all Isabella's impatient desire to see Mr. Tilney. When the orchestra struck up a fresh dance, James would have led his fair partner away, but she resisted. [...] "I tell you, Mr. Morland," [...] she cried, [...] "I would not {{do such a thing}} for all the world. How can you be so teasing; only conceive, my dear Catherine, what your brother <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> He wants me to dance with him again, though I tell him that it is a most improper thing, and entirely against the rules. It would make us the talk of the place, if we were not to change partners." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, and {{you would}} have heard me fix that if you'd waited. Where did this 'ere Massachusetts Committee of Safety get these munitions of war an' this money? Why, they got it out of the {{province}}, of course. And where did we come from? Why, we come from the province of Massachusetts, of course. Then who does this money and these munitions of war belong to? Why, they belong to us, of course. Now, as near as I have heard, there are only fourteen following Colonel Arnold. How long will it take us to lay our hands on all that stuff? Then I guarantee that Colonel Easton--for if he <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it I'll help him in conducting the campaign--will march straight through an' take Ticonderoga before you've had time to say Jack Robinson. Never mind what the Green-Mountain Boys do, an' as for the Stockbridge men, they ain't enough for the countin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose I {{ought to}} be more {{concerned}} tonight about the work I have to do in the world and anxious for you to tell me this and that, but indeed I am not concerned at all about it. I seem to have it in outline all perfectly clear. I mean to play a man's part in the world just as my father <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I mean to win his confidence and work with him--like a partner. Then some day I shall be a power in the world of fuel. And at the same time I must watch and read and think and learn how to be the servant of the world.... We two have to live like trusted servants who have been made guardians of a helpless minor. We have to put things in order and keep them in order against the time when Man--Man whom we call in America the Common Man--can take hold of his world--" ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Colbert, however, did {{not leave}} me in any doubt as <b>to</b> what she <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> She rushed up <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and seized me by both hands.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the first}} proposal, Dolores looked dull and unwilling, {{and at last}} she {{squeezed}} out, 'I don't think father will ever <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything for him again.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't care if it's only fotty cents. And I must say, Mr. Bennam, you're {{about the}} strangest vice-consul, <b>to</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, that I eva saw." ...|$|R
