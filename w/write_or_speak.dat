It argued {{for a change in}} Church teaching and that homosexual relationships should be judged by the same standard as heterosexual ones. The work had received permission from McNeill's Jesuit superiors prior to printing. In 1977, the permission was retracted at the order of the Vatican, and McNeill was ordered by Cardinal Franjo Šeper not to <b>write</b> <b>or</b> <b>speak</b> publicly about homosexuality. In a statement McNeill responded that [...] "gay men most likely to act out their sexual needs in a unsafe, compulsive way, and therefore expose themselves to the HIV virus, are precisely those who have internalised the self-hatred that their religions impose on them." [...] In 1986, the Society of Jesus subsequently dismissed him for [...] "pertinacious disobedience" [...] from the order. He remained a priest until his death but was not permitted to say Mass.|$|E

60|$|I {{might have}} made some apology for urging tradesmen to write a plain and easy style; let me add, that the tradesmen need not be {{offended}} at my condemning them, as it were, to a plain and homely style--easy, plain, and familiar language is the beauty of speech in general, and is the excellency of all writing, on whatever subject, or to whatever persons they are we <b>write</b> <b>or</b> <b>speak.</b> The end of speech is that men might understand one another's meaning; certainly that speech, or that way of speaking, which is most easily understood, {{is the best way}} of speaking. If any man were to ask me, which would be supposed to be a perfect style, or language, I would answer, that in which a man speaking to five hundred people, of all common and various capacities, idiots or lunatics excepted, should be understood by them all in the same manner with one another, and in the same sense which the speaker intended to be understood--this would certainly be a most perfect style.|$|E
60|$|It is remarkable, Sir, {{that the}} persons who {{formerly}} trumpeted forth the most loudly the violent resolutions of assemblies, the universal insurrections, the seizing and burning the stamped papers, the forcing stamp officers to resign their commissions under the gallows, the rifling and pulling {{down of the}} houses of magistrates, and the expulsion from their country of all who dared to <b>write</b> <b>or</b> <b>speak</b> a single word in defence of the powers of Parliament,--these very trumpeters are now the men that represent the whole as a mere trifle, and choose to date all the disturbances from {{the repeal of the}} Stamp Act, which put an end to them.

60|$|In {{preparing}} to <b>write</b> <b>or</b> <b>speak</b> upon {{a subject of}} which the details have been mastered, I gather, after some inquiry, that the usual method among persons who have the gift of fluency is to think cursorily on topics connected with it, until what I have called the antechamber is well filled with cognate ideas. Then, to allow the ideas to link themselves in their own way, breaking the linkage continually and recommencing afresh until some line of thought has suggested itself that appears from a rapid and light glance to thread the chief topics together. After this the connections are brought step by step fully into consciousness, they are short-circuited here and extended there, as found advisable until a firm connection {{is found to be}} established between all parts of the subject. After this is done the mental effort is over, and the composition may proceed fluently in an automatic way. Though this, I believe, is a usual way, {{it is by no means}} universal, for there are very great differences in the conditions under which different persons compose most readily. They seem to afford as good evidence of the variety of mental and bodily constitutions as can be met with in any other line of inquiry.|$|E
6000|$|We {{find in a}} broad {{survey of}} schools in general that {{there has also been}} a {{disposition}} to develop a special training in thought and expression either in the mother tongue (as in the Roman schools of Latin oratory), or in the culture tongue (as in Roman schools of Greek oratory), and we find the same element in the mediaeval trivium. Quintilian's conception of education, the reader will remember, was oratory. This aspect of school work was the traditional and logical development of the culture language-teaching. But as in Europe the culture language has ceased to be really a culture language but merely a reasonless survival, and its teaching has degenerated more and more into elaborate formalities supposed to have in some mystical way [...] "high educational value," [...] {{and for the most part}} conducted by men unable either to <b>write</b> <b>or</b> <b>speak</b> the culture language with any freedom or vigour, this crown of cultivated expression has become more and more inaccessible. It is too manifestly stupid--even for our public schoolmasters--to think of carrying the [...] "classical grind" [...] to that pitch, and, in fact, they carry no part of the education to that pitch. There is no deliberate and professed training at all in logical thought--except for the use of Euclid's Elements to that end--nor in expression in any language at all, in the great mass of modern schools. This is a very notable point about the schools of the present period.|$|E
6000|$|The high-flying Bishop, much astonished, {{does now}} eagerly answer his Prussian Majesty, [...] "Was from home, was ill, {{thought he had}} answered; is the most ill-used of Bishops;" [...] and other things of a hysteric character. [Ib. ii. 85, 86 (date, 16th September).] And there came forth, as natural to the situation, multitudinous complainings, manifestoings, {{applications}} to the Kaiser, to the French, to the Dutch, of a very shrieky character on the Bishop of Liege's part; sparingly, if at all noticed on Friedrich's: the whole of which we shall consider ourselves free to leave undisturbed in the rubbish-abysses, as henceforth conceivable to the reader. [...] "SED SPEM STUPENDE FEFELLIT EVENTUS," [...] shrieks the poor old Bishop, making moan to the Kaiser: [...] "ECCE ENIM, PRAEMISSA DUNTAXAT UNA LITERA, one Letter," [...] and little more, [...] "the said King of Borussia has, with about 2,000 horse and foot, and warlike engines, in this month of September, entered the Territory of Liege;" [...] [Helden-Geschichte, ii. 88.] which is an undeniable truth, but an unavailing. Borck is there, and [...] "2,000 good arguments with him," [...] as Voltaire defines the phenomenon.

6000|$|We all, {{whether we}} <b>write</b> <b>or</b> <b>speak,</b> must {{somewhat}} drape ourselves when we address our fellows; {{at a given}} moment we apprehend our character and acts by some particular side; we are merry with one, grave with another, as befits the nature and demands of the relation. Pepys's letter to Evelyn would {{have little in common}} with that other one to Mrs. Knipp which he signed by the pseudonym of Dapper Dicky; yet each would be suitable to the character of his correspondent. There is no untruth in this, for man, being a Protean animal, swiftly shares and changes with his company and surroundings; and these changes are the better part of his education in the world. To strike a posture once for all, and to march through life like a drum-major, is to be highly disagreeable to others and a fool for oneself into the bargain. To Evelyn and to Knipp we understand the double facing; but to whom was he posing in the Diary, and what, in the name of astonishment, was the nature of the pose? Had he suppressed all mention of the book, or had he bought it, gloried in the act, and cheerfully recorded his glorification, in either case we should have made him out. But no; he is full of precautions to conceal the [...] "disgrace" [...] of the purchase, and yet speeds to chronicle the whole affair in pen and ink. It is a sort of anomaly in human action, which we can exactly parallel from another part of the Diary.|$|E
60|$|The {{successful}} {{progress of}} thought appears to depend--first, {{on a large}} attendance in the antechamber; secondly, on the presence there of no ideas except such as are strictly germane to the topic under consideration; thirdly, on the justness of the logical mechanism that issues the summons. The thronging of the antechamber is, I am convinced, altogether beyond my control; if the ideas do not appear, I cannot create them, nor compel them to come. The exclusion of alien ideas {{is accompanied by a}} sense of mental effort and volition whenever the topic under consideration is unattractive, otherwise it proceeds automatically, for if an intruding idea finds nothing to cling to, it is unable to hold its place in the antechamber, and slides back again. An animal absorbed in a favourite occupation shows no sign of painful effort of attention; on the contrary, he resents interruption that solicits his attention elsewhere. The consequence of all this is that the mind frequently does good work without the slightest exertion. In composition it will often produce a better effect than if it acted with effort, because the essence of good composition is that the ideas should be connected by the easiest possible transitions. When a man has been thinking hard and long upon a subject, he becomes temporarily familiar with certain steps of thought, certain short cuts, and certain far-fetched associations, that do not commend themselves to the minds of other persons, nor indeed to his own at other times; therefore, it is better that his transitory familiarity with them should have come to an end before he begins to <b>write</b> <b>or</b> <b>speak.</b> When he returns to the work after a sufficient pause he is conscious that his ideas have settled; that is, they have lost their adventitious relations to one another, and stand in those in which they are likely to reside permanently in his own mind, and to exist in the minds of others.|$|E
6000|$|And now, in {{the rest}} of my lecture, I had {{intended}} to give you a broad summary of {{the rise and fall of}} English art, born under this code of theology, and this enthusiasm of duty;--of its rise, from the rude vaults of Westminster, to the finished majesty of Wells;--and of its fall, from that brief hour of the thirteenth century, through the wars of the Bolingbroke, and the pride of the Tudor, and the lust of the Stewart, to expire under the mocking snarl and ruthless blow of the Puritan. But you know that I have always, in my most serious work, allowed myself to be influenced by those Chances, as they are now called,--but to my own feeling and belief, guidances, and even, if rightly understood, commands,--which, as far as I have read history, the best and sincerest men think providential.

I went to dine with him, a day or two ago, mainly--being neither of us, I am thankful to say, blue-ribanded--to drink his health on his recovery from his recent accident. Whereupon he gave me a feast of good talk, old wine, and purple manuscripts. And having had as much of all as I could well carry, just as it came to the good-night, out he brings, for a finish, this leaf of manuscript in my hand, which he has lent me to show you,--a leaf of the Bible of Charles the Bald! ...|$|E

60|$|There is no harder {{scientific}} fact in {{the world}} than the fact that belief can be produced in practically unlimited quantity and intensity, without observation or reasoning, and even in defiance of both, by the simple desire to believe founded on a strong interest in believing. Everybody recognizes this {{in the case of the}} amatory infatuations of the adolescents who see angels and heroes in obviously (to others) commonplace and even objectionable maidens and youths. But it holds good over the entire field of human activity. The hardest-headed materialist will become a consulter of table-rappers and slate-writers if he loses a child or a wife so beloved that the desire to revive and communicate with them becomes irresistible. The cobbler believes that there is nothing like leather. The Imperialist who regards the conquest of England by a foreign power as the worst of political misfortunes believes that the conquest of a foreign power by England would be a boon to the conquered. Doctors are no more proof against such illusions than other men. Can anyone then doubt that under existing conditions a great deal of unnecessary and mischievous operating is bound to go on, and that patients are encouraged to imagine that modern surgery and anesthesia have made operations much less serious matters than they really are? When doctors <b>write</b> <b>or</b> <b>speak</b> to the public about operations, they imply, and often say in so many words, that chloroform has made surgery painless. People who have been operated on know better. The patient does not feel the knife, and the operation is therefore enormously facilitated for the surgeon; but the patient pays for the anesthesia with hours of wretched sickness; and when that is over there is the pain of the wound made by the surgeon, which has to heal like any other wound. This is why operating surgeons, who are usually out of the house with their fee in their pockets before the patient has recovered consciousness, and who therefore see nothing of the suffering witnessed by the general practitioner and the nurse, occasionally talk of operations very much as the hangman in Barnaby Rudge talked of executions, as if being operated on were a luxury in sensation as well as in price.|$|E

6000|$|There are, no doubt, many minor subjects, {{but this}} {{revision}} {{will at least}} serve to indicate the scope and chief varieties of school work. Out of some such miscellany it is that {{in most cases the}} student passes to specialization, to a different and narrower process which aims at a specific end, to the course of the College. In some cases this specialized course may be correlated with a real and present practice, {{as in the case of}} the musical, medical, and legal faculties of our universities; it may be correlated with obsolete needs and practices and regardless of modern requirements, as in the case of the student of divinity who takes his orders and comes into a world full of the ironical silences that follow great controversies, nakedly ignorant of geology, biology, psychology, and modern biblical criticism; or it may have no definite relation to special needs, and it may profess to be an upward prolongation of schooling towards a sort of general wisdom and culture, as in the case of the British [...] "Arts" [...] degrees. The ordinary Oxford, Cambridge, or London B.A. has a useless smattering of Greek, he cannot read Latin with any comfort, much less <b>write</b> <b>or</b> <b>speak</b> that tongue; he knows a few unedifying facts round and about the classical literature, he cannot speak or read French with any comfort; he has an imperfect knowledge of the English language, insufficient to write it clearly, and none of German, he has a queer, old-fashioned, and quite useless knowledge of certain rudimentary sections of mathematics, and an odd little bite out of history. He knows practically nothing of the world of thought embodied in English literature, and absolutely nothing of contemporary thought; he is totally ignorant of modern political or social science, and if he knows anything at all about evolutionary science and heredity it is probably matter picked up in a casual way from the magazines. Art is a sealed book to him. Still, the inapplicability of his higher education to any professional or practical need in the world is sufficiently obvious, it seems, to justify the claim that it has put him on a footing of thought and culture above the level of a shopman. It is either that or nothing. And without deciding between these alternatives, we may note here for our present purpose, that the conception of a general upward prolongation of schooling beyond adolescence, as distinguished from a specific upward prolongation into professional training, is necessary to the complete presentation of the school and college scheme in the modern state.|$|E
