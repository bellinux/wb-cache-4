40|$|The {{disadvantages}} of continuing industrialisation, such as environmental impacts and the decreasing resources of natural raw materials, {{have to be}} mitigated {{by the development of}} sustainable technologies. By studying geochemical processes and properties of natural materials, new sustainable processes can be designed. This field of study is known as Geochemical Engineering (Schuiling 1990, 1991). A typical example of Geochemical Engineering is the use of olivine for the neutralisation of industrial <b>waste</b> <b>acids</b> (Schuiling et al. 1986). Olivine, the fastest weathering silicate mineral, is available in large quantities and provides an excellent buffer for naturally produced acids. The use of olivine for the neutralization of industrial <b>waste</b> <b>acids</b> is therefore appealing. Compared to conventional methods for the neutralisation of <b>waste</b> <b>acids,</b> the use of olivine has the advantage that it produces valuable by-products, like precipitated silica and magnetic ferrites, while it generates no new waste streams (Schuiling et al. 1986). Since the olivine dissolution rate under natural conditions is too low for industrial application, the rate must be increased by raising the temperature or by using higher concentrations of acid or higher olivine surface areas. The properties of the first by-product, precipitated silica, depend strongly on the reaction conditions (Lieftink 1997). A wide range of precipitated silica qualities can be produced by varying temperature, grain size and quantity of olivine and acid concentration. The Olivine Process may, therefore, also be considered as an interesting alternative for current production processes of precipitated silica. The Olivine Proccess for the neutralization of <b>waste</b> <b>acids</b> was invented in 1985 at the University of Utrecht and patented (Duth Patent PCT NL 85 / 00026), the patent is currently owned by Geochem Research B. V. From 1986 - 1987 research on the improvement of the neutralization process and on applications of the neutralization products has been carried out, {{supported by a grant from}} the Dutch Ministry· of Housing and Environment (VROM). In 1993 research continued under a project financed by the E. C. Brite Euram programme titled "Olivine/Dunite for Industrial and Environmental Applications" (GR-OLIV BRE 2 -CT 92 - 0. 344). Part of the research carried out for this project is presented in this thesis. The main purpose of the investigations was to collect sufficient data, necessary for the design of a pilot plant...|$|R

5000|$|Pickling sludge is {{the waste}} product from pickling, and {{includes}} acidic rinse waters, iron chlorides, and metallic salts and <b>waste</b> <b>acid.</b> Spent pickle liquor {{is considered a}} hazardous waste by the EPA. Pickle sludge from steel processes is usually neutralized with lime and disposed of in a landfill since the EPA no longer deems it a hazardous waste after neutralization. The lime neutralization process raises the pH of the spent acid. The waste material is subject to a waste determination to ensure no characteristic or listed waste is present. [...] Since the 1960s, hydrochloric pickling sludge is often treated in a hydrochloric acid regeneration system, which recovers some of the hydrochloric acid and ferric oxide. The rest must still be neutralized and disposed of in land fills or managed as a hazardous waste based on the waste profile analysis.

5000|$|Industrial {{large scale}} {{application}} of the Koch reaction using strong mineral acids is complicated by equipment corrosion, separation procedures for products and difficulty in managing large amounts of <b>waste</b> <b>acid.</b> Several acid resins and acidic ionic liquids have been investigated in order to discover if Koch acids can be synthesized in more mild environments.

A large number of transition metal catalyst carbonyl cations have also been investigated for usage in Koch-like reactions: Cu(I), Au(I) and Pd(I) carbonyl cations catalysts dissolved in sulfuric acid can allow the reaction to progress at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Usage of a Ni(CO)4 catalyst with CO and water as a nucleophile is known as the Reppe carbonylation, and there are many variations on this type of metal-mediated carbonylation used in industry, particularly those used by Monsanto and the Cativa processes, which convert methanol to acetic acid using acid catalysts and carbon monoxide in the presence of metal catalysts.|$|E

Flotation {{characteristics}} of the fine-disseminated copper-nickel sulfides containing Pt and Pd and thermodynamic properties of high amounts of serpentine gangues by diluted acidic leaching in the ore sample of Yunnan were investigated by bench flotation tests and acidic leaching tests and their combination tests have also been conducted to exploit the harmonious design to extract all the values from the ore sample. Based {{on the results of}} bench flotation tests, {{it has been suggested that}} traditional flotation with the target of only metallic values in the ore was not available and profitable due to the fact that it was inevitable of the deteriorated dilution of serpentines in the flotation concentration using common various kinds of flocculants or depressants, in which the content of MgO in the concentrate was around 20. 0 %, while leaching tests by <b>waste</b> <b>acids</b> from producing TiO 2 indicated that this may be a promising method to extract MgO andα-Fe 2 O 3 from the ore sample, since it can weaken the disturbance of serpentines significantly and lead a satisfied results of the Cu-Ni sulfide flotation.

40|$|The {{research}} demonstrates an efficient, {{innovative and}} environmentally friendly technology which uses one waste (<b>waste</b> <b>acid)</b> to treat another (wastewater) and significantly improves the scheelite roughing recovery by 5 % {{compared with the}} same periods of previous years in the winter times. A series of modelling exercises and laboratory experiments are conducted to understand and explain the improvement achieved at the plant in Luanchuan. The speciation modelling shows that at high pH, calcium ion hydrolyses to form calcium hydroxide which cannot react with silicate to create calcium silicate and prevent the silicate removal, and thereby affects the scheelite flotation. The experiments of precipitation and sedimentation, FTIR and SEM have confirmed the prediction. Specifically, hydrochloric acid contained in the <b>waste</b> <b>acid</b> reduces pH and decreases the hydrolysis of calcium and formation of calcium hydroxide. The calcium chloride in the <b>waste</b> <b>acid</b> can precipitate silicate as calcium silicate which effectively absorbs fine solid particles in the wastewater and increases their settling velocity. The tailings provide the carrier for the precipitation, increase their settling velocity and compress the sediment bed. At the plant, the new process using the <b>waste</b> <b>acid</b> removes 60 – 65 % of silicate from the recycled water from the tailings dam which is frozen in winter, leading to the inefficient removal of silicate being harmful to the scheelite flotation...|$|E
40|$|<b>Waste</b> <b>acid</b> streams {{produced}} at industrial sites are often co-located with large sources of waste heat (e. g., industrial exhaust gases, cooling water, and heated equipment). Reverse electrodialysis (RED) {{systems can be}} used to generate electrical power and hydrogen gas using waste heat-derived solutions, but high electrode overpotentials limit system performance. We show here that an ammonium bicarbonate (AmB) RED system can achieve simultaneous <b>waste</b> <b>acid</b> neutralization and in situ hydrogen production, while capturing energy from excess waste heat. The rate of acid neutralization was dependent on stack flow rate and increased 50 × (from 0. 06 ± 0. 04 to 3. 0 ± 0. 32 pH units min - 1 m- 2 membrane), as the flow rate increased 6 × (from 100 to 600 mL min- 1). Acid neutralization primarily took place due to ammonium electromigration (37 ± 4 %) and proton diffusion (60 ± 5 %). The use of a synthetic <b>waste</b> <b>acid</b> stream as a catholyte (pH ≈ 2) also increased hydrogen production rates by 65 % (from 5. 3 ± 0. 5 to 8. 7 ± 0. 1 m 3 H 2 m- 3 catholyte day - 1) compared to an AmB electrolyte (pH ≈ 8. 5).
