5000|$|On August 23, 2004, {{controversial}} {{changes to}} exemptions from the FLSA's {{minimum wage and}} overtime requirements went into effect, making substantial modifications {{to the definition of}} an [...] "exempt" [...] employee. Low-level <b>working</b> <b>supervisors</b> throughout American industries were reclassified as [...] "executives" [...] and lost overtime rights. The changes were sought by business interests, which claimed that the laws needed clarification and that few workers would be affected. The Bush administration called the new regulations [...] "FairPay". However, other organizations, such as the AFL-CIO, claimed the changes would make millions of additional workers ineligible to obtain relief under the FLSA for overtime pay. Attempts in Congress to overturn the new regulations were unsuccessful.|$|R
40|$|The {{satisfaction}} {{of police officers}} and their spouses with two 12 -hour compressed work week shift schedules and two traditional 8 -hour shift schedules was examined. Data were collected from three detachments of the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary using structured interview and questionnaire procedures. Additionally, the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (Spanier, 1987) was used in a follow-up mail survey of spouses {{to assess the impact}} of the stress of police work and shift work on the quality of marital adjustment. The instruments were administered from May to September, 1994. [...] In each detachment a number of groups were surveyed: the constables working the 12 -hour shifts (N = 122); the shift <b>working</b> <b>supervisors</b> (N = 12); the day <b>working</b> <b>supervisors</b> (N = 7); and the spouses of the constables and <b>supervisors</b> <b>working</b> the 12 -hour shifts N = 77). Comparisons were drawn between the two types of 12 -hour shift schedules and between the 12 -hour shift schedules and the two 8 -hour shift schedules previously worked in the detachments. Comparisons were also drawn between the constables, supervisors, and spouses within the detachments. [...] The data provided support for the major hypothesis of this study: workers and their spouses preferred the 12 -hour compressed work week shift schedules over the 8 -hour shift schedules. There was no correlation between the composite satisfaction scores of workers and their spouses, implying that the factors which foster satisfaction for a worker are different from those which foster satisfaction for that worker's spouse. Surveyed spouses had, on average, a lower level of adjustment in their marriages than did respondents from previously studied non-police families. The workers reported no change in their quality of sleep or their levels of fatigue after the change to the 12 -hour shift schedules. The high preference and satisfaction levels were related to the longer periods of consecutive time off and free weekend time. Overall, the 12 -hour compressed work week shift schedule appeared to meet the psychosocial needs of most of the police officers and the spouses surveyed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigated}} the perception of two groups of <b>supervisors</b> <b>working</b> in the non-project and project schools where Lesson Study and Open Approach were implemented. Data collection was administered through participatory observation, interviews, and questionnaire distribution. The results revealed that <b>supervisors</b> <b>working</b> in the non-project schools perceived their qualifications as supervisors need to have: strong academic background and continuous professional development in terms of self-studying, further studying, and training. With regard to <b>supervisors</b> <b>working</b> in the project schools, they perceived {{that they need to}} work collegially or collaboratively with school teachers, i. e., listening to teachers, rather than providing them knowledge regarding to issues/topics. They also valued the sense of ‘collaboration’ in working as a new powerful and effective instruments to improve teaching practice of teachers, and guidelines to work as supervisors...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes that}} the social context moderates the effect of culture on {{creativity}} by drawing on the constructivist dynamic approach. We assess creativity by the level of fluency, originality, and elaboration on the usefulness and appropriateness of ideas in three contexts: <b>working</b> under a <b>supervisor,</b> in a group, and alone. We hypothesized that in high power distance cultures, <b>working</b> under a <b>supervisor</b> inhibits creativity, whereas in individualistic cultures, the presence of peers attenuates creativity. Results from two parallel experiments, one in the United States (N= 79) {{and the other in}} China (N= 83), partially support the hypotheses. The Chinese originality level was significantly lower when <b>working</b> under a <b>supervisor</b> than when <b>working</b> alone. American subjects generated fewer ideas and elaborated less when working in the presence of peers and elaborated less in the presence of peers than when under a supervisor. We conclude {{that the social}} context moderates the culture-creativity relationship by making consensual cultural values more accessible in a social context than when working alone.
