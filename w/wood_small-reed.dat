5|$|<b>Wood</b> <b>small-reed</b> (Calamagrostis epigejos) {{is present}} {{in the center of the}} site and threatens to spread into {{herbaceous}} areas. It compromises sustainability of stations, including man orchid and bee orchid populations. Two distinct zones can be distinguished. The first, where the <b>wood</b> <b>small-reed</b> has a very high rate of recovery, is not hosting any heritage value. It is mowed early and disposed of. Grazing is not possible at the moment. The second, on the contrary, not densely colonized by this plant is much more of a fragile situation due to the presence of orchids and the sickle-bearing bush cricket or long-horned groundhopper. Differentiated management is applied depending on the issues. At orchid stations, slight thinning is done early by hand pruning. The less dense areas where the grass is sparse (conducive to the long-horned groundhopper (Tetrix tenuicornis)) are pulled. In the newly opened areas, a systematic and annual pulling avoids expansion. Finally, dense areas, well exposed, are left in that state.|$|E

50|$|Calamagrostis epigejos, {{common names}} <b>wood</b> <b>small-reed</b> or bushgrass, is {{a species of}} grass in the Poaceae family which is native to Eurasia and Africa. It is found from average {{moisture}} locales to salt marsh and wet habitats.|$|E

50|$|The {{south side}} of the summit of Knowle Hill is home to the grass <b>Wood</b> <b>Small-reed</b> (Calamagrostis epigejos). The {{population}} of this plant forms a circular patch some 20 metres wide, which is visible from Bishop Sutton 1.2km south across Hollow Brook. It has been suggested that this patch is a single clone which has spread by means of underground rhizomes, and may be 200 years old.|$|E
50|$|Eggs {{are laid}} singly on the {{underside}} of foodplant leaves and hatch after about two weeks. They are normally laid on cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata) but they will occasionally use purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea), false brome (Brachypodium sylvaticum), tor-grass (B. pinnatum) and <b>wood</b> <b>small-reed</b> (Calamagrostis epigejos). Larvae also feed on various Poaceae, Phalaris arundinacea, Alopecurus pratensis, Calamagrostis purpurea, Deschampsia flexuosa, Phragmites communis and Roegneria canina., but also on Festuca, Triticum, Dactylis glomerata, Molinia, Holcus lanatus, Luzula, etc.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the differing}} age, depth, and water chemistry, the flashes show {{considerable}} variation in their {{plant and animal}} communities. The most recently formed have narrow disjunct stands of emergent vegetation dominated by great reedmace Typha latifolia and occasionally by lesser pond-sedge Carex acutiformis, whilst the oldest have extensive stands of common reed Phragmites australis. At Fodens Flash the emergent vegetation grades into fen and wet woodland dominated by alder Alnus glutinosa and willow Salix spp. <b>Wood</b> <b>small-reed</b> Calamagrostis epigejos is locally dominant in the ground flora here.|$|E
5000|$|The {{islands of}} Great Ganinick and Little Ganinick (Kenninek, place of wild garlic) (...) , {{are part of}} the GCR and are in an early stage of the linkage of two islands by a tombola. The sand bar is {{building}} from Little Ganinick, northwards, towards the larger island although the sand supply {{does not appear to be}} sufficient to link the two islands. On the north side of Great Ganinick a [...] "cuspate" [...] shaped beach is forming. Great Gannick has the only known oak tree in the Eastern Islands. Described by Mr and Mrs Dallas in 1938 as ″.... about 2 ft 6in (0.76 m) tall in tangle of bracken, bramble and honeysuckle. It was still there (or possibly one like it) in 1997. Great Gannick is rich in plant species with 74 species recorded by Lousley including butcher's-broom, wood spurge, <b>wood</b> <b>small-reed</b> and white ramping-fumitory. Little Ganiinck has grassland with strandline vegetation and seabird colonies.|$|E
5000|$|This site {{includes}} the Ashen Copse Nature Conservation Review site. This {{site is a}} large, ancient, semi-natural, broadleaved woodland with a predominantly high forest structure which is unusual in South West Britain. Over {{the majority of the}} site, where soils are poorly drained but not waterlogged, the major canopy-forming tree is pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), with ash (Fraxinus excelsior) being locally common and distributed throughout. Hazel (Corylus avellana) is the commonest shrub and occurs throughout. A large number of plant species normally found only in ancient woodlands occur, including broad-leaved helleborine (Epipactis helleborine) and <b>wood</b> <b>small-reed</b> (Calamagrostis epigejos). The breeding bird communityincludes woodcock (Scolopax rusticola), tree pipit (Anthus trivialis), wood warbler (Phylloscopus sibilatrix), redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus), buzzard (Buteo buteo), tawny owl (Strix aluco), greater spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major), lesser spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos minor) and European green woodpecker (Picus viridis). The breeding invertebrates include white admiral (Ladoga camilla), silver-washed fritillary (Argynnis paphia) and small pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria selene) butterflies and hornets (Vespa crabro).|$|E
50|$|Manual {{removal of}} the Japanese {{knotweed}} has preserved heritage stations of common butterbur and hart's-tongue fern. Early hand pruning was conducive to orchids. The late mowing seems rather ineffective. The grubbing-up of the Canada golden-rod and American asters was successful. The bush clearing and selective logging have helped maintain the wood-fringe with narrow-leaved everlasting-pea and liquorice milkvetch. Common spotted orchid, zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid, species non-adapted to open areas, benefited areas without clearing. The low dry-stone walls probably favored the installation of viviparous lizard or common wall lizard, observed in 2013, but also the consolidation of the hart's-tongue fern population.From 2007 to 2012, the number of round-leaved wintergreen footage increased by 50 percent. On the other hand, those of man orchid fall suddenly and continually. Whereas 27 plants were counted in 2003, the number reached a peak of 240 in 2006 with the uprooting of the <b>wood</b> <b>small-reed,</b> before collapsing to 13 plants in 2012, despite the continued management.

50|$|Most of {{the islands}} have dense cover of bramble Rubus fruticosus and bracken Pteridium aquilinum and {{grassland}} along the coastal fringes. Goldenrod (Solidago virgaurea) is locally abundant amongst the heath communities growing on the podzolic soils on the higher parts {{of the islands}}. The heaths are classified as a poor fit somewhere between H10 and H11 and the heather (Calluna vulgaris), bell heather (Erica cinerea) and bracken merge into pure bracken on the lower slopes. A feasibility study is needed to decide if the vegetation would benefit from grazing through a Higher Level Stewardship (HLS) agreement. With no resident botanist, together with the difficulty of recording on remote islands, {{there are not many}} plant records and the number of species for each of the Eastern Isles was finally published in 1971 from surveys carried out by J D Grose, Mr & Mrs J E Dallas and J E Lousley in 1938 and 1939. Lousley listed 111 species of higher plants in his 1971 Flora, and by 1999 further surveys recorded a similar number (114). Some of the islands have species that are only found on that island and not on the other Eastern Isles such as an oak tree found by Mr and Mrs Dallas on Great Gannick. Possible ancient woodland indicators such as butcher’s-broom (Ruscus aculeatus), wood spurge (Euphorbia amygdaloides) and <b>wood</b> <b>small-reed</b> (Calamagrostis epigejos) have also been recorded on Great Gannick. The nationally rare orange bird's-foot (Ornithopus pinnatus) is found on the northern side of Great Ganilly.|$|E
