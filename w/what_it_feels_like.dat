5|$|For the actress, having Chloe {{become part}} of the meteor {{infected}} community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve. Mack views this transition as a means for her character to become more emotionally connected to those people—the meteor infected—she spent five seasons trying to expose to the public. Being infected by the meteors gives Chloe motivation to try to understand them and allows her to grow closer to Clark, as she can better understand <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> {{to live in a world}} where you have a special ability. Writer Holly Harold believes that, in addition to being infected by the meteor rocks, bringing Lois into the journalistic field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition for growth and development. Lois's presence at the Daily Planet allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and discover what things are most important to her – her career or her family and friends. The competition that Lois provides is beneficial, as it gives Chloe a chance to bring out the best in herself.|$|E

[...] Christian Hamaker of Crosswalk.com noted that, [...] "in describing the military assault on Pandora, Cameron cribs terminology from the ongoing war on terrorism and puts it in the mouths of the film's villains... as they 'fight terror with terror'. Cameron's sympathies, and the movie's, clearly are with the Na'vi—and against the military and corporate men." [...] A columnist in the Russian newspaper Vedomosti traced Avatars popularity to its giving the audience a chance to make a moral choice between good and evil and, by emotionally siding with Jake's treason, to relieve [...] "us the scoundrels" [...] of our collective guilt for the cruel and unjust world that we have created. Armond White of New York Press dismissed the film as [...] "essentially a sentimental cartoon with a pacifist, naturalist message" [...] that uses villainous Americans to misrepresent the facts of the military, capitalism, and imperialism. [...] Answering critiques of the film as insulting to the U.S. military, a piece in the Los Angeles Times asserted that [...] "if any U.S. forces that ever existed were being insulted, it was the ones who fought under George Armstrong Custer, not David Petraeus or Stanley McChrystal."

500|$|If The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock, Gerontion, The Waste Land, and The Hollow Men are Eliot's Inferno, Ash-Wednesday {{seems to}} be Purgatorio, and the Four Quartets {{seems to be}} Paradiso. The Four Quartets {{abandons}} time, as per Dante's conception of the Empyrean, and allows for opposites to co-exist together. As such, {{people are able to}} experience God directly as long as they know that they cannot fully understand or comprehend him. Eliot tries to create a new system, according to Denis Donoghue, in which he is able to describe a Christianity that is not restricted by previous views that have fallen out of favour in modern society or contradicted by science. Eliot reasoned that he is not supposed to preach a theological system as a poet, but expose the reader to the ideas of religion. As Eliot stated in 1947: [...] "if we learn to read poetry properly, the poet never persuades us to believe anything" [...] and [...] "What we learn from Dante, or the Bhagavad-Gita, or any other religious poetry is <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> to believe that religion." ...|$|E

[...] She wanted to make a video about sex, but said that [...] "in a way that wasn't so clichéd. [...] And [...] is made to give you a picture of what sex really is, which I think is something that's very hard to do, because sex is everywhere all the time, but very rarely is it made out to be something real." [...] The video begins with a reversed scene of a young couple having sex. In cutscenes, Robyn appears with a tube dress with clear liquid flowing through it. When the young woman begins to switch her sex partners, the liquid in the tubes wrapped around Robyn begins to alter colors and flow more quickly. The video ends with Robyn standing alone with black liquid in the tubes.|$|E

[...] "We weren’t working on a finished thing, so everything keeps moving around, scenes are changing in length, and even the order of things are shuffled around, and that can get pretty frustrating when you get precious about your work.

The next scene depicts Shakira striking different poses inside a golden cage (with the sign [...] "Do Not Feed the Animal" [...] on top), clad in a skin-toned leotard.

The setting changes and Shakira is seen performing a dance routine in a club with many back-up dancers. A wolf is also shown walking in the club and transforming into a woman. Near to the end of the video, Shakira dances on a rooftop with a backdrop resembling San Francisco. As the song ends, she falls backwards from the roof and lands in her closet.

Jillian Mapes complimented the [...] "bluntness" [...] that was delivered throughout the song, and suggested that the track had [...] "anthem potential". She praised the verses for verbalizing self-confidence issues that are often associated with young women, with particular acclaim being placed on the lines [...] "I’m just a face without a choice / Trust you’d never like to guess what I think above the shoulders." [...] She concluded her review by noting that the song should be recognized as a [...] "declaration of force [...] a song about the power of vulnerability" [...] rather than confusing it for an [...] "admission of weakness".|$|E

500|$|One major {{breakthrough}} was {{the composition of}} the song [...] "Let It Go" [...] by songwriters Lopez and Anderson-Lopez, which forced the production team to reconceptualize and rewrite Elsa as a far more complex, vulnerable, and sympathetic character.

[...] Lee recalled: [...] "Bobby and Kristen said they were walking in Prospect Park and they just started talking about <b>what</b> would <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> [...] Forget villain.

[...] Jim Fusilli of the Wall Street Journal said that [...] "Mr. Richards writes with disarming introspection about his childhood, family and fame. And it's quite likely that no rock musician has ever written so keenly about the joys of making music. With a warm sense of humor and willingness to share his grief, Mr. Richards in [...] "Life" [...] defies almost every public perception about him." [...] In The Independent, John Walsh commented, [...] "He tells it with complete, reckless, disclosure. Sometimes it sounds like a man ranting into a tape machine; sometimes, in the tidier and more reflective sections, you can detect the hand of his co-writer, James (White Mischief) Fox.

The mistress of the Framework’s perversities is Aida, as Madame Hydra, and it’s hard to imagine a more different figure from Trump ... By omitting this easiest and most obvious point of satire, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. broadens its message beyond straight contemporary commentary. It is easy (and desperately tempting) to place blame all of our ills and evils on a current administration, and easy to pin all the ills of the Framework on Aida.
