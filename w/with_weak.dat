5|$|Beagles {{were in the}} United States by the 1840s at the latest, but {{the first}} dogs were {{imported}} strictly for hunting and were of variable quality.

5|$|Nepartak {{originated}} {{in a region}} of strong thunderstorm activity, associated with a broad trough of low surface pressure, which was situated around 640km (400mi) southeast of Guam by 0000 UTC on November 11. <b>With</b> <b>weak</b> wind shear and modest divergence of air over the system, it began to mature, although initially the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) downplayed the potential for tropical cyclogenesis. Over the next several hours, a low-level circulation center became evident and convection organized around it, prompting the JTWC to issue an updated outlook. At 1800 UTC, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the storm as a tropical depression while it was located northeast of Yap in the Caroline Islands. The JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert for the system at 2030 UTC, and designated it Tropical Depression 25W at 1200 UTC on November 12. The system intensified gradually as it began to track quickly westward toward the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after 1700UTC on September22, {{the eye of}} Janet {{passed over}} Barbados. A {{reconnaissance}} flight into the hurricane discovered that the Hurricane Janet's eye measured only 20mi (32km) in diameter, with gale force winds extending 120mi (190km) away {{from the center of}} circulation. The flight also reported a minimum barometric pressure of 979mbar (hPa; 28.91inHg). After passing between the islands of Grenada and Carriacou in the morning hours of September23, Janet entered an area of unfavorable conditions in the eastern Caribbean Sea. As a result, the hurricane became disorganized, with winds weakening to 90mph (145km/h) by 1200UTC on September23. A U.S. Navy reconnaissance plane entered the hurricane early on September24, reporting a lack of organization, and noting an indiscernible center of circulation <b>with</b> <b>weak</b> rainbands.

5|$|The {{origins of}} Imbudo {{were from a}} disorganized area of {{convection}} near Chuuk in the open western Pacific in mid-July. <b>With</b> <b>weak</b> wind shear, the system slowly became better organized. On July15, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated that a tropical depression formed. The next day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert (TCFA), noting that outflow had increased due to an upper-level low to the northeast. At 1800UTC on July16, the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 09W about 665km (415mi) east of Yap. A subtropical ridge near Okinawa steered the nascent depression to the west-northwest for much of its duration. With warm waters and favorable upper-level conditions, the depression quickly organized, and the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm Imbudo on July17.|$|E
5|$|<b>With</b> <b>weak</b> {{steering}} currents {{provided by}} {{an area of}} high pressure to the north, the disturbance slowly moved towards the east-southeast. At 1500UTC, the JTWC began issuing advisories on the disturbance which they designated as Tropical Cyclone 16S. With high oceanic heat content, low wind shear, and good divergence aloft, significant strengthening was likely. Early the next day, Météo-France upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression as winds increased to 55km/h (35mph 10-minute winds). However, in the post-season analysis, Météo-France determined that the system had become a depression about 12hours earlier and was already a moderate tropical storm {{by the time of}} the operation upgrade. At 0600UTC, Météo-France classified the depression as a moderate tropical storm and was given the name Hondo; a name submitted to the World Meteorological Organization by Zimbabwe. It was later determined that Hondo was already a severe tropical storm by the time it was named operationally.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on August15, the NHC began {{forecasting}} {{that the}} hurricane would make landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina within two days. Early on August16, the eye became better defined, although the feature diminished {{within a few}} hours, and the NHC {{was on the verge}} of downgrading Felix to tropical storm status. A break in the ridge allowed Felix to turn to the north, bringing it about 150mi (250km) east of the Outer Banks. An approaching trough turned the hurricane to a northeast drift, and there was initial uncertainty whether Felix would loop back to the west or recurve to the northeast. During this time, the system remained a minimal hurricane, maintaining a large eye about 60 to 80miles (95 to 130km) in diameter, but <b>with</b> <b>weak</b> convection due to cooler air. After the trough that turned Felix to the east-northeast bypassed it to the north, the hurricane turned to the southeast, executing a small loop while northwest of Bermuda. On August20, Felix weakened below hurricane intensity for the first time in nine days, due to cooler waters and increased wind shear. By that time, the convection was removed from the center, and another trough brought the storm to the northeast. While passing east of Newfoundland on August22, Felix became extratropical. The remnants continued to the northeast, eventually passing north of the United Kingdom on August25.|$|E
40|$|Drawing on {{transaction}} cost theories and the resource-based {{view of a}} firm, we posit {{that the value of}} corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives is greater in countries where an absence of market-supporting institutions increases {{transaction cost}}s and limits access to resources. Using a large sample of 11, 672 firm-year observations representing 2445 unique firms from 53 countries during 2003 – 2010 and controlling for firm-level unobservable heterogeneity, we find supportive evidence that CSR is more positively related to firm value in countries <b>with</b> <b>weaker</b> market institutions. We also provide evidence on the channels through which CSR initiatives reduce transaction costs. We find that CSR is associated with improved access to financing in countries <b>with</b> <b>weaker</b> equity and credit markets, greater investment and lower default risk in countries with more limited business freedom, and longer trade credit period and higher future sales growth in countries <b>with</b> <b>weaker</b> legal institutions. Our findings provide new insights on non-market mechanisms such as CSR through which firms can compensate for institutional voids...|$|R

5|$|In late September 1996, a {{cold front}} stalled over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, {{producing}} {{an area of}} convection. The thunderstorms were possibly related to the same tropical wave that spawned Hurricane Hernan in the eastern Pacific Ocean. A low pressure area formed in the Bay of Campeche by October2, although initially upper-level conditions did not favor tropical cyclogenesis. The convection became more persistent on October3 and gradually became better organized. On October4, classifications based on the Dvorak technique began, and later that day the Hurricane Hunters flew into the system. Based on {{the data from the}} flight, it is estimated that Tropical Depression Ten formed at 1800UTC that day off the northeast coast of Mexico. During its formative stages, the depression interacted with a ridge near the Great Lakes to produce strong winds across the Gulf Coast of the United States. <b>With</b> <b>weak</b> steering currents, the depression moved slowly to the northeast, and initially, wind shear prevented further organization. On October6, a strong trough caused the system to accelerate to the east-northeast. The storm's west to east motion across the Gulf of Mexico was unusual although not unprecedented.|$|E
5|$|Located to {{the south}} of a mid-level ridge, the {{depression}} moved to the west-northwest. <b>With</b> <b>weak</b> to moderate upper-level wind shear over the system, the depression gradually organized, and intensified into Tropical Storm Erin on September 2. Though Erin had favorable upper-level outflow and developing convection, the inner core of the storm remained disorganized. The storm slowly strengthened, and attained an initial peak intensity of 60mph (95km/h) while located about 1,150miles (1,855km) east of the Lesser Antilles. Favorable conditions were expected to allow Erin to continue to strengthen to reach winds of 85mph (135km/h). However, an upper-level low to the northwest of Erin produced strong vertical shear over the storm, and Erin quickly weakened as the low-level circulation became exposed {{to the south}}west of the deep convection. The shear slightly abated on September 4, allowing Erin to briefly re-strengthen. However, the storm remained disorganized, and following an increase in southwesterly wind shear Erin began a weakening trend. On September 5, Erin weakened to a tropical depression, and hours later the low-level circulation dissipated.|$|E
5|$|Partial {{agonists}} {{are defined}} as drugs that, at a given receptor, might differ in the amplitude of the functional response that they elicit after maximal receptor occupancy. Although they are agonists, partial agonists {{can act as a}} competitive antagonist {{in the presence of a}} full agonist, as it competes with the full agonist for receptor occupancy, thereby producing a net decrease in the receptor activation as compared to that observed with the full agonist alone. Clinically, their usefulness is derived from their ability to enhance deficient systems while simultaneously blocking excessive activity. Exposing a receptor to a high level of a partial agonist will ensure that it has a constant, weak level of activity, whether its normal agonist is present at high or low levels. In addition, it has been suggested that partial agonism prevents the adaptive regulatory mechanisms that frequently develop after repeated exposure to potent full agonists or antagonists. Buprenorphine, a partial agonist of the μ-opioid receptor, binds <b>with</b> <b>weak</b> morphine-like activity and is used clinically as an analgesic in pain management and as an alternative to methadone in the treatment of opioid dependence.|$|E
