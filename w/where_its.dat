5|$|Despite its {{chemical}} similarity, lithium typically {{does not}} occur together with sodium or potassium due to its smaller size. Due to its relatively low reactivity, {{it can be found}} in seawater in large amounts; it is estimated that seawater is approximately 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm) or 25 micromolar. Its diagonal relationship with magnesium often allows it to replace magnesium in ferromagnesium minerals, <b>where</b> <b>its</b> crustal concentration is about 18ppm, comparable to that of gallium and niobium. Commercially, the most important lithium mineral is spodumene, which occurs in large deposits worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field stops its atmosphere from being stripped {{away by the}} solar wind. Venus and Mars do not have {{magnetic field}}s, {{and as a result}} the solar wind is causing their atmospheres to gradually bleed away into space.

The interaction of this magnetic field and material with Earth's magnetic field funnels charged particles into Earth's upper atmosphere, <b>where</b> <b>its</b> interactions create aurorae seen near the magnetic poles.|$|E
