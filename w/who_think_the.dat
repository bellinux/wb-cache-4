5|$|The {{occurrence}} of planktonic foraminifera across the K–Pg boundary {{has been studied}} since the 1930s. Research spurred {{by the possibility of}} an impact event at the K–Pg boundary resulted in numerous publications detailing planktonic foraminiferal extinction at the boundary, however, there is debate ongoing between groups that think the evidence indicates substantial extinction of these species at the K–Pg boundary, and those <b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> evidence supports multiple extinctions and expansions through the boundary.|$|E

25|$|Kven and Sami people share {{a common}} history of Norwegianization. However, post-Norwegianization {{policies}} have treated them differently. Sami people have been recognized as the indigenous people in Northern Norway. They have their own schools and parliament, and they elect three of the six members for the board of Finnmark Estate (the organization owning about 95% {{of the land in}} the county of Finnmark). Some Kvens believe the distribution of rights and public funds has favored the Sami people too much, whereas on the Sami side there are people <b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> Norwegian minority politics and public funding should focus mostly on the Sami people.|$|E
500|$|Stewart felt betrayed: [...] "It {{has been}} my fight ever since I became a {{minister}} {{to see that the}} farmers of the province were having a square deal," [...] he remarked, [...] "and I think I have done this with some success." [...] Despite his general sympathy with the aims of the UFA, he could not support their transition into a political party. For one, he disagreed with the UFA's belief that politics should be conducted along class, rather than ideological, lines. [...] Stewart believed that [...] "the more strongly armed the classes become the harder will it be to get the things we really need in our government" [...] and asserted that [...] "I never did and never will have any desire to form a coalition with anybody except with men <b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> same as I do." ...|$|E
500|$|Freiberger {{pitched the}} subplot {{involving}} the model rockets {{in the beginning}} of the episode. He based it on a real-life experience, in which he, as a child, accidentally launched a model rocket into a window in his house. A scene from this subplot was removed from the episode following the September 11 attacks. The scene would show a man named Hassan Jay Salam being arrested by policemen (who tells them to call his cousin Casey Kasem), <b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> rocket Bart and Homer launched was launched by him (The rocket bears the abbreviation HJS, which stands for Homer J Simpson). After the attacks, the scene was considered too offensive by the Fox censors, so the scene was removed. Originally, the subplot would involve Marge trying to get Homer to build model rockets with Bart. Homer would not want to at first, but after Marge convinces him, he would soon get more into it than Bart. The plot idea was encouraged by some of the writers who thought that Marge had [...] "gotten short shrift," [...] and, according to Freiberger, Marge would have had a [...] "really big part motivating the story" [...] had the subplot remained intact.|$|E

[...] "I mostly agree with Doug fans <b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> original 104 eleven-minute Doug stories made for Nick were the best", Jinkins later said.

Cowell warns him to not [...] "become the mean judge, like I did", since he himself does not have many friends. He tries to be more positive, but Cowell mocks his judgment of a contestant, he realizes that Cowell tricked him; angered, Moe threatens Cowell's life on air, but is apprehended by security and expelled from the building.|$|E
2500|$|Some FEE-based {{analyses}} {{suggest that}} the famine {{was a result of}} policy failure or bungling. Others assert that prioritised distribution and the denial policies reflected the War Cabinet's callous willingness to [...] "supply the Army's needs and let the Indian people starve if necessary" [...] when weighing how to allocate wartime resources. In this view, economic policies were designed to serve externally oriented British military goals at the expense of internally oriented Indian interests, and so the UK government bears moral responsibility for the rural deaths. [...] The policies may have met their intended goals, but only at the cost of harrowing, large-scale dislocations in the domestic economy. Far from being accidental, this argument maintains, these dislocations were fully recognised beforehand as fatal for identifiable Indian groups whose economic activities did not directly, actively, or adequately advance military goals. The analysts split into two broad camps: those <b>who</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> government unwittingly caused or was unable to respond to the crisis, and those who think it willfully ignored the plight of starving Indians. The former see the problem as a series of avoidable war-time policy failures and [...] "panicky responses" [...] from a government that was spectacularly inept, overwhelmed and in disarray, the latter as a conscious miscarriage of justice by the [...] "ruling colonial elite" [...] who abandoned the poor of Bengal.|$|E
