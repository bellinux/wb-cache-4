25|$|Palestinian {{officials}} estimated on 4 September that, with 17,000 homes {{destroyed by}} Israeli bombing, the reconstruction would cost $7.8 billion, {{which is about}} 3 times Gaza's GDP for 2011. Gaza City suffered damage to 20–25% of its housing and Beit Hanoun with 70% of its housing uninhabitable. The New York Times noted that damage in this third war was more severe than in the two preceding wars, where {{in the aftermath of}} the earlier Operation Cast Lead the damage inflicted was $4 billion, 3 times the then GDP of Gaza's economy. Strikes on Gaza's few industries <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>years</b> to repair. Gaza's main power plant on Salaheddin Road was damaged. Two sewage pumping stations in Zeitoun were damaged. The biggest private company in Gaza, the Alawda biscuit and ice cream factory, employing 400, was destroyed by a shelling barrage on 31 July, a few days after undertaking to supply its Choco Sandwich biscuits to 250,000 refugees in response to a request from the World Food Programme; other strikes targeted a plastics factory, a sponge-making plant, the offices of Gaza's main fruit distribution network, the El Majd Industrial and Trading Corporation's factory for cardboard box, carton and plastic bag production, Gaza's biggest dairy product importer and distributor, Roward International. Trond Husby, chief of the UN's Gaza development programme in Gaza, commented that the level of destruction now is worse than in Somalia, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Uganda.|$|E

50|$|Plastics {{themselves}} {{contribute to}} approximately 10% of discarded waste. Many kinds of plastics exist {{depending on their}} precursors and the method for their polymerization. Depending on their chemical composition, plastics and resins have varying properties related to contaminant absorption and adsorption. Polymer degradation takes much longer {{as a result of}} haline environments and the cooling effect of the sea. These factors contribute to the persistence of plastic debris in certain environments. Recent studies have shown that plastics in the ocean decompose faster than was once thought, due to exposure to sun, rain, and other environmental conditions, resulting in the release of toxic chemicals such as bisphenol A. However, due to the increased volume of plastics in the ocean, decomposition has slowed down. The Marine Conservancy has predicted the decomposition rates of several plastic products. It is estimated that a foam plastic cup <b>will</b> <b>take</b> 50 <b>years,</b> a plastic beverage holder <b>will</b> <b>take</b> 400 <b>years,</b> a disposable diaper <b>will</b> <b>take</b> 450 <b>years,</b> and fishing line <b>will</b> <b>take</b> 600 <b>years</b> to degrade.|$|R
500|$|On November 8, 2007, Reagan Library National Archives {{officials}} {{reported that}} due to poor record-keeping, {{they are unable to}} say whether approximately 80,000artifacts have been stolen or are lost inside the massive museum complex. A [...] "near-universal" [...] security breakdown was also blamed, leaving the artifacts vulnerable to theft. Many of the nation's presidential libraries claim to be understaffed and underfunded. NARA labeled the Reagan Library as having the most serious problems with its inventory. In an audit, U.S. Archivist Allen Weinstein blamed the library's poor inventory software for the mishap. Frederick J. Ryan Jr., president of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation's board of directors, said the allegations of poor management practices at the library reflect badly on the National Archives. The library has undertaken a massive inventory project that <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>years</b> to complete.|$|E
2500|$|SWANCCs {{implications}} for {{the scope of the}} federal wetlands permitting program are certain to be significant, but it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>years</b> of litigation before they are fully clear. A key source of confusion is the aforementioned disconnect between the decision's narrow holding and broad rationale. The latter appears to preclude any effort by the Corps to assert jurisdiction over isolated waters, including isolated wetlands, on the basis of linkages with interstate commerce other than the interstate flight of migratory birds. (The Corps asserted such non-migratory-bird linkages after the litigation commenced, noting that SWANCCs municipal landfill is clearly of a commercial nature and, when aggregated with similar activity elsewhere, would substantially affect interstate commerce. The Supreme Court declined to consider this argument, pointing out that landfill activity is a [...] "far cry" [...] from the [...] "waters of the United States" [...] to which the CWA extends.) Plainly, the degree of section 404 program contraction occasioned by SWANCC will depend on which aspects of the decision shape the government's response.|$|E

It is as clear as daylight even now, that it <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>years</b> to recover all our men and material from France, and that if the tunnel (one will suffice for the time), were at once set in hand, it might be ready to help in this task and so free shipping {{for the return of}} the Americans. One thing however, is clear. It is far too big and responsible and lucrative an undertaking for a private company, and it should be carried out and controlled by Government, the proceeds being used towards the war debt.|$|E
