5|$|Croitoru's {{most famous}} {{encounter}} with the law occurred on January 6, 2005 when {{he was charged with}} the November 16, 1998 murders of Lynn and Fred Gilbank. The couple was shot execution-style with a shotgun. Police suspect that the murders were in response to Lynn Gilbank's assistance in getting William and Angie Smith into a witness protection program after William Smith gave the police information about the Gravelle crime family. Croitoru, who had several contacts within the Gravelle family (including a contract to kill police inspector Rick Wills, who was investigating the Gravelles), <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> in the investigation and had his phones tapped during the investigation.|$|E
5|$|Halotus (c. 20–30 ADc. 70–80 AD) was {{a servant}} to the Roman Emperor Claudius, the fourth {{member of the}} Julio-Claudian dynasty. He served Claudius as a taster and as a chief steward; {{it was because of}} his occupation, which entailed close contact with Claudius, that he is and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> in the murder of the latter by poison. Along with Agrippina the Younger, the wife of Claudius, Halotus was {{considered}} one of the most likely to have committed the murder, although speculation by ancient historians suggest that he may have been working under orders of Agrippina.|$|E
5|$|Adam, a photographer, awakens in {{a bathtub}} {{in a large}} {{dilapidated}} bathroom, and finds himself chained at the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence Gordon, an oncologist, is similarly shackled across the room, and between them is a corpse holding a revolver and a microcassette recorder. Each man has a tape in his pocket, and Adam is able to retrieve the recorder. Adam's tape urges him to escape the bathroom, while Lawrence's tape tells him to kill Adam by six o'clock, or {{his wife and daughter}} will be killed and he will be left to die. Adam finds a bag containing two hacksaws inside a toilet tank; they attempt to cut through the chains, but Adam's saw breaks and he throws it at the mirror in frustration, revealing a hidden camera behind the mirror. Lawrence realizes that the hacksaws weren't meant for the chains, but for their feet and identifies their captor as the Jigsaw Killer, whom Lawrence knows of because he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> five months before.|$|E

25|$|In October, Overland {{moved to}} have the entire case {{dismissed}} {{on the grounds that}} the initial investigators should have identified Lazarus as a suspect but failed to do so. In support, he cited missing aspects of the original file such as recordings of interviews, Sherri Rasmussen's blood toxicology report, as well as a polygraph test Ruetten allegedly failed. The motion noted Nels Rasmussen's belief that Lazarus <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> at the time of the murder, and his ensuing efforts to get the LAPD to take that theory seriously. Because of this failure, he argued, Lazarus' due process rights had been adversely affected since the quality of evidence had degraded in the intervening 23 years.|$|E
25|$|After his {{fingerprints}} {{were found}} at the crime scene, Guede was extradited from Germany; he had said on the Internet that he knew he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> and wanted to clear his name. Guede opted for a fast-track trial, held in closed session with no reporters present. He told the court that {{he had gone to}} Via della Pergola7 on a date arranged with Kercher, after meeting her the previous evening. Two neighbours of Guede's, foreign female students who were with him at a nightclub on that evening, told police the only girl they saw him talking to had long blonde hair. Guede said Kercher had let him in the cottage around 9pm. Sollecito's lawyers said a glass fragment from the window found beside a shoe-print of Guede's {{at the scene of the}} crime was proof that Guede had broken in.|$|E
25|$|Raymond was {{considered}} the deadly older brother who was the eldest of all the brothers and had a criminal record stretching back to 1947. Raymond specialized in extortion and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> of hundreds of crimes throughout Montreal but despite his crime and tactics he was rarely convicted. In November 1976, Raymond had been driving in his limousine when he was violating traffic laws by going through twelve red lights in a row, when he was pulled over by a police officer and was arrested, he grabbed the officers finger and twisted it until it broke. Raymond faced murder charges in 1974 but was acquitted. Raymond died at his own hand in 1989 when he committed suicide {{at the age of}} 57 and was found in a hotel room surrounded by pills with his wrists slit.|$|E

25|$|The {{case has}} {{attracted}} {{a high level of}} national media coverage. Discovery Channel published an article several months after her disappearance discussing how the high levels of media coverage, including some instances of inaccurate media coverage, have hurt the investigation. A notable example of misinformation was the description of her last known movements. Early reports inaccurately reported that Bobo was dragged into the woods. Clint later clarified that Holly had in fact walked with the man wearing camouflage into the woods, either willingly or by coercion. This clarification led to rumors that Clint had changed his story and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> in his sister's disappearance. Whitney Duncan defended him in an April 17 Twitter statement, stating that he was innocent and not a suspect in the case. Some early sources also erroneously reported that the skull was found on property owned by Zach Adams' family. Her body was found 10 miles away from Adams' property on land owned by the Tubbs family.|$|E
25|$|Farah Swaleh Noor was 38 {{years old}} at the time of his death. He arrived in Ireland in December 1996, {{claiming}} to be a Somalian called Sheilila Salim whose family had been killed in Mogadishu. Subsequent investigations revealed that he was in fact Kenyan and that his family was still alive. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform ordered that he be deported but he appealed and was granted citizenship in March 1999 on grounds he became the father of an Irish-born child. He had four previous convictions for offences including intoxication, threatening and abusive behaviour and assault. In 1997, he raped a mentally disabled 16-year-old Chinese girl. She later gave birth to a son. Two other women had children by him and both described having been raped by him. Noor had faced eight charges of disorder and assault, one involving a sexual assault in which a knife was found at the scene by gardaí. He was convicted on three occasions but never served time in jail. Noor lived in a number of areas in Dublin, including Dún Laoghaire and Firhouse, as well as the inner city before moving in with Kathleen Mulhall. Gardaí described him as being particularly violent towards women. Noor <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> in the unsolved murder of Raonaid Murray which took place in September 1999. Authorities are now satisfied Noor did not carry out this murder.|$|E
25|$|Jacob Drucker and Irving Cohen {{were put}} on trial {{separately}} {{for the murder of}} racketeer Walter Sage in the Catskills. Sage was killed with an ice pick and had the frame of a slot machine tied to his body, which was found in Swan Lake on July 31, 1937. After the Sage murder, believing he was also going to be killed, Cohen fled to California and managed to secure small roles in films. According to the chief prosecution witness, Abraham Levine, Sage was riding in a car with Cohen and Drucker when he was stabbed 32 times with an icepick as Levine and Harry Strauss were following in another car. During the assault and struggle, Drucker stabbed Cohen once in the arm as Sage had grabbed the steering wheel and wrecked the car. Levine also testified that he observed Drucker wiping the icepick clean before helping dispose of the body. Cohen testified in his own defense, stating that Levine had stabbed him with an icepick as he was walking home from a casino. Cohen stated that he was assaulted by Levine and another man on Drucker's orders since he refused to pay 25% profit on a game of chance that he operated. Cohen was acquitted on June 21, 1940. Drucker, who <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> in four murders in the Catskills, was a fugitive for over three years, until the FBI located him in Delaware. Drucker was convicted of second-degree murder on May 5, 1944, and received a sentence of 25 years to life. Drucker died in Attica prison in January 1962.|$|E

500|$|Novel-writing <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> {{occupation}} {{for women}} in the early 19th century, because it imperiled their social reputation by bringing them publicity, viewed as unfeminine. Therefore, like many other female writers, Austen published anonymously. Eventually, though, her novels' authorship became an open secret among the aristocracy. During one of her visits to London, the Prince Regent invited her, through his librarian, James Stanier Clarke, to view his library at Carlton House; his librarian mentioned that the Regent admired her novels and that [...] "if Miss Austen had any other Novel forthcoming, she was quite at liberty to dedicate it to the Prince". Austen, who disapproved of the prince's extravagant lifestyle, did not want to follow this suggestion, but her friends convinced her otherwise: in short order, Emma was dedicated to him. Austen turned down the librarian's further hint to write a historical romance in honour of the prince's daughter's marriage.|$|E
500|$|Powell {{noted that}} the university, in its briefs, had cited {{decisions}} where there had been race-conscious remedies, {{such as in the}} school desegregation cases, but found them inapposite as there was no history of racial discrimination at the University of California-Davis Medical School to remedy. [...] He cited precedent that when an individual was entirely foreclosed from opportunities or benefits provided by the government and enjoyed by those of a different background or race, this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>suspect</b> classification. [...] Such discrimination was only justifiable when necessary to a compelling governmental interest. [...] He rejected assertions by the university that government had a compelling interest in boosting the number of minority doctors, and deemed too nebulous the argument that the special admissions program would help bring doctors to underserved parts of California—after all, that purpose would also be served by admitting white applicants interested in practicing in minority communities. Nevertheless, Powell opined that government had a compelling interest in a racially diverse student body.|$|E
