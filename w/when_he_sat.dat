5|$|Michigan {{concluded}} January {{by beating}} Northwestern {{a second time}} on January 30, becoming the first team {{in the country to}} reach 20 wins. After enduring an injured ankle against Illinois, starting center Jordan Morgan missed his first game since redshirting a full season for the 2009–10 Wolverines <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> out the Northwestern game. Horford started in his place.|$|E

25|$|When Liu Bei was {{appointed}} as the Chancellor (相) of Pingyuan State (平原國; around present-day Dezhou, Shandong), Guan Yu and Zhang Fei were appointed as Majors of Separate Command (别部司马), each commanding detachments of soldiers under Liu. The {{three of them}} shared a brotherly-like relationship, {{to the point of}} sharing the same room. Zhang Fei and Guan Yu also stood guard beside Liu Bei <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down at meetings. They followed him on his exploits and protected him from danger.|$|E

60|$|Do a man a kindness, he continued, {{assuming}} a safer posture, and 'e tries {{to borrow money}} off of you; do a woman a kindness and she thinks you want tr marry 'er; do an animal a kindness and it tries to bite you--same as a horse bit a sailorman I knew once, <b>when</b> <b>'e</b> <b>sat</b> on its head to 'elp it get up. <b>He</b> <b>sat</b> too far for'ard, pore chap.|$|R

25|$|Zhang Fei {{was from}} Zhuo Commandery (涿郡), {{which is in}} present-day Zhuozhou, Hebei. In the 180s, {{towards the end of}} the Han dynasty, he and Guan Yu became Liu Bei's followers. As Guan Yu was many years older than Zhang Fei, Zhang {{regarded}} him as an elder brother. When Liu Bei was later appointed as the Chancellor (相) of Pingyuan (平原; present-day Pingyuan County, Dezhou, Shandong) by the Han imperial court, Zhang Fei and Guan Yu served as Majors of Separate Command (別部司馬) under him. The three of them shared a brotherly-like relationship, to the point of sharing the same room. Zhang Fei and Guan Yu also stood guard beside Liu Bei <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down at meetings. They followed him on his exploits and protected him from danger.|$|E
500|$|Hagerstrom {{was born}} on January 14, 1921, in Cedar Falls, Iowa. He was the third son of Edward, an electrician, and Hazel Hagerstrom. He {{grew up in a}} small house in Waterloo, Iowa. His {{interest}} in aviation began <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> in the cockpit of a Curtiss JN-4 biplane at the age of 5, and it increased at thirteen when he [...] "had the thrill of his life": a short fifty-cent flight in a Ford Trimotor aircraft.|$|E
500|$|Vane's stance {{can be seen}} in the way {{the first}} Rhode Island patent was drafted in 1643, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> on the Parliamentary {{committee}} charged with colonial affairs. [...] Unique among all of the early English colonial charters, it contains provisions guaranteeing freedom of religion. [...] (Vane assisted Roger Williams again in 1652, when the latter sought a confirmation of the Rhode Island charter and the revocation of a conflicting charter that had been issued to William Coddington.) ...|$|E

6000|$|They all saw {{now that}} he had {{something}} to tell. 'I am going away,' <b>he</b> said <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had <b>sat</b> down. 'I am going to enter on board a man-of-war, and perhaps it will be the Victory.' ...|$|R
500|$|Leverett's time in England {{brought him}} to {{a belief in the}} need for more {{religious}} tolerance. [...] He would pursue the idea politically, often in the face of opposition from the conservative Puritan leadership of Massachusetts that opposed religious views that did not accord with their narrow views. [...] He specifically opposed the Cambridge Platform describing New England church orthodoxy, and opposed punishments of nonconforming individuals <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> as a deputy in the Massachusetts general court (the colonial legislature). [...] John Winthrop, in writing about the 1648 synod that adopted the platform, noted that those [...] "who came lately from England" [...] were strongly opposed to its resolutions.|$|E
500|$|The Pixies rehearsed {{throughout}} 1986, {{and began}} performing around Boston in late 1986 and during 1987. Santiago met his future wife, Linda Mallari, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> beside her after a 1987 Pixies show at The Rat. Mallari noted their shared Filipino ancestry and suggested they write music together. She then offered {{to join the}} Pixies, but Santiago replied, [...] "We already have a chick in the band." [...] Throughout Santiago's time with the Pixies, the two often met up to write songs and drink martinis, {{but they did not}} release any material. According to Santiago, they [...] "broke up a couple of times" [...] early in their relationship.|$|E
500|$|At {{subsequent}} hearings, {{each side}} submitted replications (affidavits) with {{his version of}} the evidence. Ashford sought for the Court to rule that the evidence against Thornton was strong and that the defendant was thus ineligible to wage battle; Thornton sought the opposite. Much of the case was argued between 6 and 8 February 1818, but one of Ashford's counsel, Joseph Chitty, asked for and received more time so he could reply to the other side's arguments, and the matter was adjourned until 16 April. Chitty then responded but was so often interrupted in his argument by the judges that <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down, according to Sir John Hall in his book on the affair, [...] "it was clear to everyone in Court that his client had lost his case".|$|E
50|$|Ancram {{was called}} to the Scottish Bar in 1970 and {{continued}} to practice as an Advocate until 1979, apart from a brief period in 1974 <b>when</b> <b>he</b> first <b>sat</b> as an MP; he became a Queen's Counsel (QC) in 1996.|$|R
50|$|Born in Brooklyn, New York in 1955, Kirkland was six <b>when</b> <b>he</b> first <b>sat</b> {{down at a}} piano keyboard. After {{years of}} Catholic schooling, Kirkland {{enrolled}} at the Manhattan School of Music, where he studied classical piano performance, classical theory and composition.|$|R
60|$|One day Monsieur Ducroz {{seemed to}} be in great pain. He had been {{scarcely}} able to drag himself up the many stairs to Philip's room: and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> arrived <b>sat</b> down heavily, his sallow face drawn, with beads of sweat on his forehead, trying to recover himself.|$|R
500|$|During the {{afternoon}} of September 15, Hendrix was asked by his friend Eric Burdon, formerly of the Animals, {{if he wanted to}} participate in a jam session at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club with Burdon's newly formed band, War. Hendrix accepted, but {{when he arrived at the}} club that evening, he was not allowed to play due to his apparently drug-related disorientation. Burdon commented: [...] "Jimi came down and was well out of it. He... was wobbling too much to play, so I told him to come back the following night." [...] Hendrix returned the next night and presented a healthier appearance. The crowd was enthusiastic and impressed by his performance despite his uncharacteristically subdued guitar playing <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> in with War on [...] "Tobacco Road" [...] and [...] "Mother Earth". This was the last time Hendrix played guitar in public.|$|E
500|$|Dormand {{had been}} brought up a Christian, an {{allegiance}} which continued into adulthood, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> on the parochial church council. He described his adoption of atheism {{as the result of}} [...] "some years of very considerable thought", and once freed from the fear of offending religious constituents, his atheism became more outspoken in the Lords; in July 2000 he called for the disestablishment of the Church of England. He helped form the All Party Humanist Group, and became Vice-President of the British Humanist Association. [...] As a former teacher, he sought parity in schools for religions and humanism, seeking to have both described neutrally rather than propagated. [...] After his death, Michael Turnbull, the former Bishop of Durham, wrote in The Times of how Dormand had pursued this and other causes [...] "without prejudice" [...] and with [...] "a warm affection for others".|$|E
500|$|Waugh's {{dissipated}} lifestyle {{continued into}} his final Oxford year, 1924. A letter written that {{year to a}} Lancing friend, Dudley Carew, hints at severe emotional pressures: [...] "I have been living very intensely these last three weeks. For the last fortnight I have been nearly insane.... I may perhaps one day in a later time tell {{you some of the}} things that have happened". He did just enough work to pass his final examinations in the summer of 1924 with a third-class. However, as he had begun at Hertford in the second term of the 1921–22 academic year, Waugh had completed only eight terms' residence <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> his finals, rather than the nine required under the university's statutes. His poor results led to the loss of his scholarship, which made it impossible for him to return to Oxford for that final term, so he left without his degree.|$|E

60|$|Eleanor saw {{well how}} it was, {{but she did}} leave him, and glided silently back to her drawing-room. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> had <b>sat</b> a while, thus alone and unoccupied, {{he got up to}} walk again;--he could make more of his {{thoughts}} walking than sitting, and was creeping out into his garden, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> met Bunce on the threshold.|$|R
60|$|Toby {{had risen}} to his feet <b>when</b> <b>he</b> began to make his speech, {{and while he was}} {{speaking}} Mr. Stubbs had crawled over into his chair. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> finished <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down again without looking behind him, and of course sat plump on the monkey. There was a loud outcry from Mr. Stubbs, a little frightened noise from Toby, an instant's scrambling, and then boy, monkey, and chair tumbled off the platform, landing on the ground in an indescribable mass, from which the monkey extricated himself more quickly than Toby could, and again took refuge {{on the top of the}} tent pole.|$|R
500|$|Larkin's early {{childhood}} {{was in some}} respects unusual: he was educated at home {{until the age of}} eight by his mother and sister, neither friends nor relatives ever visited the family home, and he developed a stammer. Nonetheless, when he joined Coventry's King Henry VIII Junior School he fitted in immediately and made close, long-standing friendships, such as those with James [...] "Jim" [...] Sutton, Colin Gunner and Noel [...] "Josh" [...] Hughes. Although home life was relatively cold, Larkin enjoyed support from his parents. For example, his deep passion for jazz was supported by the purchase of a drum kit and a saxophone, supplemented by a subscription to Down Beat. From the junior school he progressed to King Henry VIII Senior School. He fared quite poorly <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> his School Certificate exam at the age of 16. Despite his results, he was allowed to stay on at school; two years later he earned distinctions in English and History, and passed the entrance exams for St John's College, Oxford, to read English.|$|E
500|$|Presley's {{singing to}} his own [...] "necessarily limited, both rhythmically and melodically," [...] piano accompaniment, such as can be heard on the 1967 {{recording}} of [...] "You'll Never Walk Alone", for Guralnick are always special occasions, because [...] "it was always a measure of his engagement <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down at the keyboard to play." [...] Describing his piano technique as [...] "staccato style," [...] Jorgensen finds that on [...] "Without Love" [...] from the 1969 sessions, [...] "his gospel-flavored treatment took it {{to a level of}} spirituality rarely matched in his career." [...] Presley also played the instrument on the [...] "impassioned version" [...] of the sessions' next song, [...] "I'll Hold You in My Heart," [...] of which Guralnick writes that [...] "there is something magical about the moment that only the most inspired singing can bring about, as Elvis loses himself in the music, words no longer lend themselves to literal translation, and singer and listener both are left emotionally wrung out by the time the song finally limps to an end." ...|$|E
500|$|Weinberg started {{actually}} {{playing at}} the age of six. His first public appearance came {{at the age of}} seven <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> in on a bar mitzvah band playing [...] "When the Saints Go Marching In". The bandleader, Herbie Zane, was the leading act for bar mitzvahs and weddings in the area; he was impressed with young Weinberg and brought him along on other engagements as a kind of novelty act. Weinberg thus became a local child star, drumming in a three-piece mohair suit. He gained an appreciation for showmanship and was a fan of Liberace and Sammy Davis, Jr. He grew to idolize drummer Buddy Rich and become a fan of Gene Krupa and saw drummer Ed Shaughnessy of Doc Severinsen's band on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson as having an ideal job as well as admiring the level of playing and serious sartorial style of the Tonight Show musicians. Weinberg stayed with Zane until junior high school and learned rhythms such as cha-chas, merenges, polkas, and the hora and playing everything from Dixieland jazz to Acker Bilk's [...] "Stranger on the Shore".|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} {{come to my}} room," [...] said Sir Harry, gruffly, {{and led the way}} into his own sanctum. <b>When</b> there, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down in his {{accustomed}} arm-chair without offering George a seat, but George soon found a seat for himself. [...] "And now what is it?" [...] said Sir Harry, with his blackest frown.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>he</b> entered <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down at {{a vacant}} table, and, having ordered a stoup of wine, looked round. The man had joined a knot of young fellows like himself, seated at a table. They were dissipated-looking blades, and were talking loudly and boisterously.|$|R
50|$|Bench was {{appointed}} to the Canadian Senate on November 19, 1942 by William Lyon Mackenzie King and, at 37, was Canada's youngest Senator <b>when</b> <b>he</b> first <b>sat</b> in the Upper House. A Liberal he ran for election to the Canadian House of Commons in 1940 but was defeated in the riding of Lincoln.|$|R
500|$|Notwithstanding the {{rebellion}} {{and death in}} battle against the king of Suffolk's son and heir, the duke {{does not seem to}} have lost the trust of King Henry. He was once again appointed trier at the 1487 parliament, and mustered men for Henry's expedition the next year. Around the same time he also lost the constableship of Wallingford again. Although Suffolk did not actually lose much under Henry Tudor, his heirs were to suffer. At the 1487 parliament that Suffolk attended, Lincoln was attainted for treason; Suffolk kept his own lands and also those he had granted Lincoln; but this was only for his life, and on de la Pole's death, these estates were to revert to the crown. This was not long to be effected. Although Suffolk seems still to have been alive on 14 May 1492, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> as county JP he was certainly dead six days later. He was buried, wearing the mantle of the Order of the Garter, in the college he founded at Wingfield in Suffolk in a 'splendid' tomb which belied the [...] "discreet obscurity" [...] in which he had spent his final years. His effigy portrays him as being bearded, [...] "with wavy hair bound with a jewelled fillet and ear ring in the right ear." [...] Elizabeth, who died later, was buried next to him wearing a widow's barbe.|$|E
2500|$|The Mishnah {{interpreted}} the words [...] "he shall write {{a copy of}} this law in a book" [...] in [...] to teach that when he went to war, he was to take it with him; on returning, he was to bring it back; <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> in judgment, it was to be with him; and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down to eat, it was to be before him, to fulfill the words of [...] "and it shall be with him and he shall read in it all the days of his life." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{lyrics to}} [...] "Vindication" [...] {{were written by}} Rockenfield. Wilton has said: [...] "I'm sure he had some demons in his mind to avenge or vindicate <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> down to write that one." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{handed her}} down. She {{led the way}} on to the terrace. A few paces behind, Nagaski, with {{drooping}} head and depressed mien, followed us. <b>When</b> we halted, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> upon his haunches and watched me.|$|R
6000|$|<b>When</b> {{at length}} <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> {{up and was}} able to speak, [...] His sad story he offered to tell; [...] And the Bellman cried [...] "Silence! Not even a shriek!" [...] And excitedly tingled his bell.|$|R
6000|$|... "Humph! {{a little}} water won't hurt 'em. I've been soaked myself more than once.
