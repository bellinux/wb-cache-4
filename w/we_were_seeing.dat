500|$|In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy {{caused a}} lot of damage to New York City, and many subway tunnels were {{inundated}} with floodwater. The subway opened with limited service two days after the storm and was running at 80 percent capacity within five days; however, some infrastructure needed years to repair. A year after the storm, MTA spokesperson Kevin Ortiz said, [...] "This was unprecedented in terms of the amount of damage that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>seeing</b> throughout the system." [...] The storm flooded nine of the system's 14 underwater tunnels, many subway lines, and several subway yards, as well as completely destroying a portion of the IND Rockaway Line and much of the South Ferry terminal station. Reconstruction required many weekend closures on several lines, as well as several long-term closures on the Greenpoint Tunnel, Montague Street Tunnel, Rockaway Line, and the South Ferry station, with a long-term closure planned for the 14th Street Tunnel; some reconstruction is expected to last until at least 2020. As a preventative measure, 68 subway entrances in Lower Manhattan are also receiving fabric plugs that are intended to keep flood water out. In October 2017, it was revealed that [...] waterproof doors and curtains were being installed in 24 Lower Manhattan locations at a cost of $30,000 each.|$|E

Martin also felt that the multitude of sources for superpowers in comics strained suspension of disbelief when taken together, and he believed a single plausible source was needed. Snodgrass suggested a virus, which allowed for the superpowered Aces, the [...] "monsters and freaks" [...] Jokers, and a high death toll. Snodgrass and Martin also developed the card based terminology, and Milan developed the pseudoscience of the series.|$|E

Her father {{was one of the}} leading appellate lawyers in the United States and served as a law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black. Cornwell later traced her own motivations in life to the emotional abuse she says she suffered from her father, who walked out on the family on Christmas Day 1961. She has said, [...] "He was on his deathbed.

2500|$|According to editor John D. Dunning, {{the first}} {{cut of the}} film was four and {{one-half}} hours long (although a mass media report in March 1959 indicated the running time was closer to five hours). A total of [...] was shot for the film. William Wyler said {{his goal was to}} bring the running time down to three and a half hours. Editors Dunning and Winters saw their job as condensing the picture without losing any information or emotional impact. Dunning later said that he felt some of the leper colony sequence could have been cut. The most difficult editing decisions, he also said, came during scenes which involved Jesus Christ, as these contained almost no dialogue and most of the footage was purely reaction shots by actors. Editing was also complicated by the 70mm footage being printed. [...] Because no editing equipment (such as the Moviola) existed which could handle the 70mm print, the 70mm footage would be reduced to 35mm and then cut. This caused much of the image to be lost, and according to Dunning [...] "you didn't even know what you had until you cut the negative. We'd print up the 70 now and then, and project it to see what we were getting against what <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>seeing</b> in the 35. We really did it blind." [...] When the film was edited into its final form, it ran 213 minutes and included just [...] of film. It was the third-longest motion picture ever made at the time, behind Gone With The Wind and The Ten Commandments.|$|E
2500|$|Illustrator Benjamin Roman {{made his}} {{professional}} debut {{with the first}} volume of I Luv Halloween; he wanted to create [...] "something that was offbeat and a little gory, but with a kind of humor and playfulness." [...] Having spent years {{trying to get into the}} comic book industry, he moved to Los Angeles, California, in 2003, and worked at Kinko's in Hollywood; there, he met a Tokyopop employee, who passed along some of his [...] "rejected proposals" [...] to now-former editor Mark Paniccia. Keith Giffen, an American comic book illustrator and writer who had previously adapted the Tokyopop-licensed manga Battle Royale and Battle Vixens for an English-language audience, joined the project as the writer. Together, they spent three to four years working on the series. Although Roman did not draw the series with any particular influences in mind, he read Calvin and Hobbes and Marvel books as a child. Drawing inspiration from science-fiction and horror films in general, Roman acknowledged that [...] "some of that same kitsch finds itself in I Luv Halloween." [...] For the plot, Roman and Giffen were given [...] "a lot of leeway creatively," [...] and Roman commented: [...] "I think that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>seeing</b> how irresponsible we could go with that story and still get away with it. We were just trying to let loose with the characters, however violent that mentality my have turned at some points." [...] As a way to celebrate the conclusion of the series, Roman gave away more than one hundred pages of I Luv Halloween artwork and five hundred replicas of Finch's mask at the 2007 San Diego Comic-Con International.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>seeing</b> {{the wonders}} of the city in the {{guidance}} of a charming boy whom we had found in wait for us at the gate of the hotel garden when we came out. He offered his services in the best English he had, and he had enough of it to match my Spanish word for word throughout the morning. He led us from the bull-ring to the church known to few visitors, I believe, where the last male descendant of Montezuma lies entombed, under a fit inscription, and then through the Plaza past the college of Montezuma, probably named for this heir of the Aztec empire. I do not know why the poor prince should have come to die in Ronda, but there are many things in Ronda which I could not explain: especially why a certain fruit is sold by an old woman on the bridge. Its berries are threaded on a straw and look like the most luscious strawberries but taste like turpentine, though they may be avoided under the name of madrones. But on no account would I have the reader avoid the Church of Santa Maria Mayor. It is so dark within that he will not see the finely carved choir seats without the help of matches, or the pictures at all; but it is worth realizing, as one presently may, that the hither part of the church is a tolerably perfect mosque of Moorish architecture, through which you must pass to the Renaissance temple of the Christian faith.|$|E
