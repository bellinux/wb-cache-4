40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{determination}} of the geometric structural parameters of a glass textile reinforcement, which is embedded into an epoxy polymer matrix, by micro-computed tomography (CT). Therefore, four different glass fabrics were investigated. The CT images of the composites feature a good contrast between glass reinforcement and polymer matrix. The resolution is high enough for the determination of the geometric structural parameters: wavelength of warp and fill yarn, amplitude of warp and fill yarn, <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> and fill yarn, height of warp and fill yarn and the gap between two adjacent warp and fill yarns. The micro-computed tomography shows a high potential for an efficient measurement of the three dimensional geometric structural properties of laminated woven textile fabrics...|$|E

30|$|Identifying {{and keeping}} yarn tension {{variation}} {{as low as}} possible is important in textile processes. In weaving process, it is desired to obtain constant uniform warp tension across the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the <b>warp.</b> Since during fabric formation, low warp tension creates clinging that causes unclear passage for the filling. While high tension increases yarn breaks. Detecting and controlling the optimum warp tension will maximize the weaving efficiency, improves fabric quality, fabric dimensional stability due to better ratio <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> crimp to weft crimp and enhances the uniformity of color shade (Gahide 2001). The running tension should be at a value neither to over-elongate nor to entangle the yarn (Eskew 2006).|$|R

Due to the influence of mechanical forces taking part in the embroidery process, the embroidery system is deformed, resulting in noncompliance of the embroidery element with the digitally designed one. Three fabrics have been selected as the objects of the research with the fiber composition of 65  % polyester and 35  % cotton, differing by weave and density. 60  ×  60  mm and 6  mm wide closed circuit square-shaped embroidery elements have been used for the research. According to the performed analysis of the results, the dimensions of the closed-circuit square-shaped embroidery element have changed in comparison to that of the digitally designed one. The <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the embroidery element, which was the most adequate to the digitally designed one, was achieved in the direction <b>of</b> <b>warp.</b> The obtained results have shown that in the corners the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the embroidery element in the directions <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> and weft is bigger than the one in the centers of the segments.

Imagery of the African rift system resolves the major Cainozoic faults, zones <b>of</b> <b>warping,</b> and associated volcanism. It also clearly depicts the crystal {{grain of the}} Precambrian rocks where these are exposed. New structural features, or new properties of known features such as greater extent, continuity, and linearity are revealed by ERTS- 1 imagery. This applies, for example, to the NE-SW fracture zones in Yemen, the Aswa mylonite zone at {{the northern end of}} the Western Rift, the Nandi fault of western Kenya, the linear faults of the Elgeyo escarpment in the Gregory Rift, and the hemibasins <b>of</b> <b>warped</b> Tertiary lavas on the Red Sea margin of Yemen, matching those of Ethiopian plateau-Afar margin. A tentative scheme is proposed, relating the effect on the pattern of Cainozoic faulting of the degree of obliquity to Precambrian structural trend. It is particularly noteworthy that, even where the Precambrian grain determines the rift faulting to be markedly oblique to the overall trend of the rift trough, for example, in central Lake Tanganyika, the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the trough is not significantly increased.
