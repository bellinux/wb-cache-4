5|$|Due to {{uncertainty}} {{over whether the}} object would be classified as a planet or a minor planet, because different nomenclature procedures apply to these different classes of objects, the decision on what to name the object had to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> August 24, 2006, IAU ruling. As a result, for a time the object became known to the wider public as Xena.|$|E
5|$|To {{begin the}} game, a {{category}} is revealed, {{and the three}} teams of three contestants are asked multiple choice questions under that category, with each question having four possible answers. The contestant who buzzes in with the correct answer earns the respective team 100 points; an incorrect answer loses 100 points, and opens up the question to the other teams. Contestants must <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> host reads the entire question (including the choices) to buzz in.|$|E
5|$|A second {{conflict}} emerged {{just before}} the end of his term, when in 1945, the Labour government sought to abolish the country quota, a system that gave additional electoral seats in rural areas. Farming groups – predominantly National-supporting – strongly opposed the move, and argued that such a major change could only be made after gaining approval in a general election. Newall sympathised, and advised Fraser to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> election, but did not feel it was appropriate to intervene; he assented to the bill.|$|E
50|$|US Season 3, {{filmed in}} New York, took a looser {{documentary}} format. Stilwell sometimes implements a technique {{as soon as}} she sees a behavior rather than <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Confrontation.|$|R
30|$|Evaluation of the CEUS images was {{performed}} in real time, whereas the CT images were reviewed just <b>after</b> <b>the</b> acquisition and reconstruction of the four phases (unenhanced, arterial, portal and late phase); the characterisation of focal liver lesions on MR imaging required <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> acquisition of the hepato-specific phase 60  min <b>after</b> administration of <b>the</b> contrast medium.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the musical}} version, Franz does not {{interrupt}} <b>the</b> play, but <b>waits</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> performance {{to confront the}} producers, and then attempts to kill them under the accusation of making a fool out of Hitler, who [...] "didn't need their help." [...] He breaks his other leg while trying {{to run away from}} the police.|$|R
5|$|On 6 May 1970, Stewart {{suggested}} to Wilson {{that they should}} formally advise the Queen to remove Beadle from the Privy Council. Wilson resolved to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> British general election the following month. This decision proved decisive for Beadle as, {{to the surprise of}} many, the Conservatives won the election, and Edward Heath replaced Wilson as Prime Minister. Heath's government decided against removing Beadle from the Privy Council, surmising that this would only hinder progress towards an accommodation with Smith. Beadle remained a Privy Counsellor {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|The couple put {{extra effort}} into {{avoiding}} {{the issues that}} had caused strife before their separation: Despite being an indifferent cook and housekeeper, Green {{tried to focus on}} cooking and keeping the new house cleaner, while Farrar vowed to curtail his work hours so that he could spend more time with the family. The improvements lasted mere months, however, {{and by the end of}} 1994, both Green and Farrar had fallen back to their old habits and the marriage was again floundering. Fearful of another confrontation with Green, and looking forward to a trip to Peru the family had planned for June 1995, Farrar nevertheless decided to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> trip to raise the issue of a divorce again.|$|E
5|$|Even though Johnson {{had been}} given a mandate to take {{military}} action against North Vietnam and their Viet Cong allies in South Vietnam, he hesitated to take further steps to retaliate against North Vietnam. Towards the end of 1964, Johnson {{was in the midst of}} a presidential election and he did not want the U.S. public to believe that he was leading their country into war. Therefore, Johnson decided to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> election, when his presidency was assured, that he would decide on other military moves. Meanwhile, the political situation in South Vietnam continued to worsen; in August 1964, South Vietnamese General Lan Van Phat tried to overthrow General Nguyễn Khánh, but the coup was aborted and Phat handed power to Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, and Generals Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. However, on 20 December 1964, Khánh formed a new military junta with Kỳ and Thi and the civilian-led High National Council was subsequently dissolved. Thus, the South Vietnamese Government was once again plunged into chaos.|$|E
50|$|In April 2005 he tore his {{anterior}} cruciate ligament in his knee. Unlike in tennis or basketball, cycling doesn't require lateral stability because the athlete doesn't {{need to be able}} to stop or launch himself sideways. He was able to race with a leg brace for much of <b>the</b> year. He <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> 2005 NBL Grand Nationals to have the surgery.|$|R
50|$|On May 6, 2016, Scott {{received}} the endorsements of all Vermont Republican legislators (listed above) except State Representatives Donald Turner, Doug Gage, Mary Morrissey, Job Tate, and Paul Dame. Among those five legislators {{who did not}} endorse Scott, four said they always remain neutral in a party primary election, and one was <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> filing deadline to make an endorsement.|$|R
60|$|She {{rose and}} left him, with this, and Austin, {{who was not}} {{altogether}} pleased with his commission, <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> four o'clock comida, when, flinging himself down on a settee in the engineer's room, cigar in hand, he put the case to Macallister, who grinned. The latter, as a rule, appeared to find his native idiom more expressive in the evening.|$|R
5|$|Speedie {{was drafted}} by the National Football League's Detroit Lions in the late rounds of the 1942 draft. Fred Mandel, {{the owner of the}} Lions, visited him at Fort Warren and offered a {{contract}} worth $2,800 a year. Speedie wanted to sign immediately, but Mandel preferred to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> war. By the time the war drew to a close in 1945, however, Speedie was considering signing with the Chicago Rockets, a team in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC). He was pursued by the Rockets after playing well against a team at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro from which many of the Rockets' players were drawn. Speedie was also spotted by Paul Brown, who had been the head coach of a military team at Great Lakes Naval Station that played against the Broncos. Brown, who was starting a new AAFC team called the Cleveland Browns, sent a friend named Jackie Ranen to sign Speedie for $7,000 in 1946.|$|E
25|$|Giuliani {{opposed the}} Don't ask, don't tell policy, but thought {{the repeal of}} it should <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> {{war on terror is}} over.|$|E

50|$|Most {{municipal}} chapters, {{including that}} of party leader Tony Wiklander's in Åstorp, however <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> split of the Sweden Democrats in 2001 and thereafter merged with the Sweden Democrats, the more moderate faction. In Åstorp, Kommunens framtid was formed in January 2002 {{as a replacement for}} the Progress Party for the 2002 elections. By 1997 the Progress Party had likely no more than 300 members.|$|R
5000|$|In May 1974, Perón {{expelled}} the Montoneros {{from the}} Justicialist movement. <b>The</b> Montoneros <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> death of Perón in July 1974 to react. They {{claimed to have}} the [...] "social revolutionary vision of authentic Peronism" [...] and started guerrilla operations against the government. The more radically right-wing factions quickly {{took control of the}} government; Isabel Perón, president since Juan Perón's death, was essentially a figurehead under the influence of Rega.|$|R
50|$|Although each {{situation}} will vary, {{one of the}} primary reasons for seeking the appointment of an interim examiner is to facilitate him commencing his work immediately rather than <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> full hearing. In addition, it is often felt that the appointment of an interim examiner offers a certain level of reassurance to creditors and suppliers and to the company's employees who are frequently unaware of <b>the</b> intended application <b>until</b> <b>after</b> it has been made.|$|R
25|$|By 2003, however, it was {{becoming}} clear that switchover could not start by 2006. In particular, the decision taken by the International Telecommunication Union to call a Regional Radiocommunication Conference to establish a frequency plan for digital broadcasting meant that in practice, substantive steps towards switchover would need to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> conference's second session, due {{to be held in}} May and June 2006.|$|E
25|$|In {{the aspect}} of childbirth, men are {{required}} to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> mother has had birth and dressed in a decent manner to visit his wife and newborn child. Mothers typically accompany the new mother during birth. Much like the American culture, Hispanic women take time to rest after childbirth, but traditionally they returned to heavier labor jobs as opposed to jobs normally held by women within society.|$|E
25|$|The Razorbacks were {{selected}} as national champions by the Football Writers Association of America and the Helms Athletic Foundation, after the Alabama Crimson Tide lost their bowl {{game against the}} Texas Longhorns in the Orange Bowl. Arkansas defeated Texas in Austin earlier in the season. Because the final AP and Coaches (UPI) Polls were released before bowl games were played at the time, the Crimson Tide was selected national champions by the AP and Coaches (UPI) Polls. Because of the controversy, the AP Poll decided to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> bowl games to select their champion in the 1965 season.|$|E
50|$|While Luckie had {{initially}} filed {{to run for}} the seat held by term-limited Dixie Allen, his ascension to the Statehouse was expedited when Allen switched to the Republican Party and subsequently resigned her seat to run for Montgomery County Commissioner. Although the seat was vacant, Democrats <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> 2006 general election to officially seat Luckie, who took his seat on November 14, 2006. He was easily reelected in 2008, as well as in 2010.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bones were}} found {{lying on the}} cave floor or buried in its claylike sediments ("mud clast breccias") {{interspersed}} with layers of deposited calcite flowstone. Geologists estimate that the cave in which the fossils were discovered is no older than three million years.The discovery team <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> research article was published before trying radiocarbon dating because the technique destroys parts of the fossils. [...] Radiocarbon dating can only date fossils which are less than 50,000 years old.|$|R
5000|$|Willa and Caroline {{are playing}} {{hide and seek}} at Caroline's house. As Willa runs through the house {{looking for a place}} to hide we see that Caroline's house is very upscale. It's three stories with a {{swimming}} pool and expensive furniture. Robbie is hiding in a tree across the street watching his sister. He is supposed to pick up Willa but he <b>waits</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Millerton's let Willa eat dinner with them before he knocks on the door.|$|R
25|$|The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund {{requested}} {{information and}} records from Baltimore police including body camera footage, policies on {{the execution of}} arrest warrants {{and a copy of}} the department's agreement with the county police union. Police stated there is no body camera footage from inside the apartment, but that some officers assigned to support roles outside were wearing cameras. Following the publicized NAACP request, Baltimore police published their response providing some of the requested details and documents but declined to release certain information, stating that the public would need to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> investigation is complete.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, {{the airport}} was {{discussed}} in the Parliament of Norway's Standing Committee on Transport and Communications. The committee was split on whether it should nationalize the airport. The Labour Party and the Conservative Party, who had a majority in Parliament, wanting to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> Triangle Link—a fixed link from Stord and Bømlo southwards to Haugaland—was built, so see how it affected patronage at Sørstokken. The Centre Party, the Socialist Left Party and the Christian Democratic Party wanted to nationalize the airport. A unanimous committee chose to give a NOK1 million grant {{to build a new}} terminal and no longer require the airport to follow the Civil Aviation Administration's fees, allowing it to set its own.|$|E
500|$|According to a U.S. Office of Strategic Services (OSS) report, [...] "The Nazi Master Plan", Hitler {{planned to}} destroy the {{influence}} of Christian churches within the Reich. His eventual goal was the total elimination of Christianity. This goal informed Hitler's movement early on, but he saw it as inexpedient to publicly express this extreme position. According to Bullock, Hitler wanted to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> war before executing this plan.|$|E
5000|$|Mainwaring {{is holding}} a parade, and {{complains}} {{about the lack of}} attendance at last Sunday's church parade. Walker admits he couldn't come because he was delivering some knicker elastic to a group of ATS girls. Mainwaring wonders why he couldn't have <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> parade, and Walker says that he could, but they couldn't! Mainwaring then moves on to commenting on the length of Pike and Wilson's hair, and suggest they get it cut - they [...] "aren't violin players".|$|R
5000|$|Alton narrates that Glen is {{torn between}} {{the idea of}} being honest with Barbara before their wedding, or <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>after.</b> <b>The</b> {{narrative}} shifts briefly from Glen's story to how society reacts to sex change operations. A conversation between two [...] "average joes", concludes that society should be more [...] "lenient" [...] when it comes to people with tranvestite tendencies. The story returns to Glen, who confides in a transvestite friend of his, John, whose wife left him after catching him wearing her clothes.|$|R
50|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> Ravens {{lost to the}} Miami Dolphins in {{his first}} start 6-9, Wright led a {{spectacular}} comeback against the Seahawks; with the score tied {{at three in the}} final minute of the first half, the Seahawks scored two quick touchdowns, and stormed to a 41-24 lead with seven minutes remaining, but Wright erupted with four touchdown throws and 319 passing yards in a 44-41 overtime triumph. Ravens head coach Brian Billick gave the game ball to Wright's wife, for <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> contest to induce labor.|$|R
500|$|Progress M1-5 {{spent two}} months docked to Mir before the deorbit burn occurred. The gap between docking and deorbit {{was in order}} to allow the {{spacecraft}} to dock whilst Mir was still in a stable orbit, but then to allow some natural decay, or decrease in altitude, to occur in order to conserve the Progress' fuel. Controllers determined that they should wait for the station's orbital altitude to reach [...] before deorbiting it. In addition, RKK Energia wanted to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> fifteenth anniversary of the launch of the Core Module, on 19 February.|$|E
500|$|On October 12, Quantrill {{and his men}} met General Samuel Cooper at the Canadian River and {{proceeded}} to Mineral Springs, Texas, to rest for the winter. Anderson married Bush Smith, a woman from Sherman, Texas. Anderson ignored Quantrill's request to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> war and then separated his men from Quantrill's band. The {{tension between the two}} groups markedly increased—some feared that open warfare would result—but by the wedding, relations had improved. [...] In March, at the behest of General Price, Quantrill reassembled his men, sending most of them into active duty with the Confederate Army. He retained 84 men and reunited with Anderson. Quantrill appointed him a first lieutenant, subordinate only to himself and to Todd.|$|E
500|$|Other {{cabinet members}} became resentful of Seward, {{who seemed to}} be always present when they {{discussed}} their departments' concerns with Lincoln, yet they were never allowed to be there when the two men discussed foreign affairs. Seward announced when cabinet meetings would be; his colleagues eventually persuaded Lincoln to set a regular date and time for those sessions. Seward's position on the Emancipation Proclamation when Lincoln read it to his cabinet in July 1862 is uncertain; Secretary of War Edwin Stanton wrote at the time that Seward opposed it in principle, feeling the slaves should simply be freed as Union armies advanced. [...] Two later accounts indicate that Seward felt the time was not yet to issue it, and Lincoln did <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> bloody stalemate at Antietam that ended Confederate General Robert E. Lee's incursion into the North to issue it. In the interim, Seward cautiously investigated how foreign powers might react to such a proclamation, and learned it would make them less likely to interfere in the conflict.|$|E
25|$|The Vikings {{began the}} 2007 offseason by losing their {{defensive}} coordinator, Mike Tomlin, {{who was hired}} {{to be the head}} coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers on January 21, 2007.

The pontiff said that the move was part of a broader restructuring of the Vatican bureaucracy that had been decided well before the synod, but he had <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> <b>after</b> <b>the</b> synod to make it official so Burke could still participate in the meeting as the head of a Vatican department.|$|R
