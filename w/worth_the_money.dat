25|$|Evidently, {{there are}} still {{questions}} as to his specific reasons for leaving the game. There were even reports that Parcells had been holding out for more money, and that Cowboys' owner Jerry Jones simply did not think Parcells' performance was <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> he was demanding for the upcoming season.|$|E
25|$|In the 1993–94 season, Dublin {{regained his}} fitness, but his first team chances were {{restricted}} by the excellent form of Eric Cantona. In December 1993, Ferguson agreed {{a deal with}} Everton manager Howard Kendall, that would have seen Dublin moving to Goodison Park, but a member of Everton's board of directors, apparently feeling that Dublin was not <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> Kendall had offered United, intervened to prevent the transfer going through – this incident led directly to Kendall's resignation as Everton manager and Dublin ended up staying at Old Trafford {{until the end of}} the season.|$|E
500|$|Luis Enrique {{called the}} final [...] "spectacular", and his team's opponents [...] "absolutely top-level". Of the Juventus team, he singled out Buffon for praise. In his own side, he commented that Neymar {{had gone from}} [...] "very, very good" [...] in his {{previous}} season, to [...] "spectacular" [...] in this one, ranking him among the world's best players. Luis Enrique stated that Suárez' performances had been <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> Barcelona paid for him, despite initial doubt whether he would adapt to a new team. In spite of Barcelona's treble, the manager concluded {{that it had been}} [...] "a difficult year, a transitional year".|$|E

500|$|Overall, reviewers {{acknowledged}} Freelancer {{fell short}} of the promises initially made by Roberts; however, it demonstrated a high quality of work in its implemented features. [...] The various concepts were well meshed together to form an entertaining product. [...] It never broke or raised the bar of its genre, but boasted a high production value, and has been said to be well <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>money.</b> The game, however, was an anti-climax {{for those who were}} hooked by the touted and promised initial concepts, many of which were never realized. [...] Freelancer was a [...] "hugely ambitious game", as admitted by Chris Roberts, for a company to develop without the necessary capital and resources.|$|E
500|$|The Starlog reviewer, David McDonnell, {{lists the}} anthology's best stories as Lansdale's [...] "Torn Away", Zahn's [...] "Vampin' Down the Avenue", Resnick and Robyn's [...] "Benchwarmer", and Armstrong's [...] "A Haunted House of Her Own". McDonnell noted that Rod Serling's [...] "El Moe" [...] was least {{like a typical}} Twilight Zone story, and that Williams's [...] "Ants" [...] belonged to the Alfred Hitchcock Presents {{universe}} rather than The Twilight Zone. On Ain't It Cool News, Adam Balm identified [...] Wu's [...] "On the Road" [...] as [...] "the best entry in the collection". Balm wrote that the anthology is [...] "uneven, with too many stories disappointing and too many that are nostalgianautic remember-whens, mining territory long since tamed and settled by others" [...] but ultimately <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> spent.|$|E
500|$|The {{reviews for}} Lights and Sounds were mostly mixed upon release, {{particularly}} from mainstream media, but {{some critics have}} stated that the album had fallen well short of the standards of Ocean Avenue, the album's predecessor. Kelefa Sanneh of the New York Times, in review of the album, wrote: [...] "To listeners {{on either side of}} rock's latest generational divide, there's a big difference -- the difference of a decade -- between being a loser and being a twerp... Lights and Sounds is Yellowcard's attempt to split that difference." [...] Sanneh reports that the song [...] "Two Weeks from Twenty", one of the band's anti-war song, [...] "sounds suspiciously like Green Day; the lyrics echo the plot of the video for Green Day's 'Wake Me Up When September Ends'." [...] Despite this, Sanneh {{goes on to say that}} Yellowcard is still [...] "pretty good" [...] at [...] "writing sweeping, upbeat punk-rock love songs". Ben Breier of Kent News wrote: [...] "One thing is certain: The Yellowcard you grew to know and love circa Ocean Avenue is no longer with us. The band has vastly matured when compared to past records, but it comes at a price [...] members forgot what made them occasionally catchy and addictive in the first place. It's clearly the right direction for the band, but Yellowcard needs to further refine its new style before it can come up with something above average." [...] Mike Schiller of PopMatters, who was somewhat displeased with the album, wrote that the album does not [...] "make up for the overabundance of flaccid mediocrity on display throughout most of the album". Schiller went on to say, [...] "Lights and Sounds may be Yellowcard’s attempt at a big, serious album, but the band doesn’t sound even remotely ready." [...] Nick Cowen from Drowned in Sound wrote: [...] "Those who register for Pop-Punk 101 will receive Yellowcard’s Lights And Sounds as their first set-work; the Jacksonville quintet's new album would be the perfect teaching aid, as it's technically proficient while being boring and forgettable enough not to inspire the temptation to plagiarise." [...] Cowen concluded that the album [...] "is a substandard, second-tier album with some strings thrown in for good measure. It's really not <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> in your wallet [...] even if that wallet is attached to a very long chain." [...] Now magazine claimed that the band [...] "may be in the right place, it's clear they're simply incapable of realizing this clumsy faux magnum opus." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, Friday Night with Jonathan Ross was {{nominated}} for a BAFTA. According to The Times, Ross {{was nominated}} soon after he was banned. Melody Sachs complained about Ross being nominated so soon after the controversy in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, saying: [...] "I am amazed that Ross should get rewarded with a mouth like his. Nobody is saying he hasn't got talent, but what he did was so disgusting. Of course he is not <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> but he is good at his job. However, I don't think he should be rewarded so soon after what happened. It is like people are saying, 'Let's forget all about it and see what we can give him.' It is wrong and bad timing to give or even put up this guy for recognition when he has done such a terrible thing. It was unforgivable, really. I'm not angry, I just don't believe it." ...|$|E

[...] MTV's Aimee Curran also gave the concert a positive review, writing: [...] "The cast {{was able to make}} every song their own while still managing to maintain the original artist's integrity." [...] Hahn Nguyen of Zap2it wrote: [...] "seeing it live is well <b>worth</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> and effort. Not only is there an elevated, infectious energy you don't get from just watching the show at home, but the feeling of togetherness can't be matched." [...] and [...] "One can truly hear the quality of the live vocals, which in the case of Lea Michele is the real deal. She sounds even better than on the show...Her [...] "Don't Rain on My Parade" [...] live is an amazing and thrilling treat." [...] Variety Andrew Barker gave a less favorable review, writing: [...] "while its distinctive blend of high camp and recognizable tunes may click on the small screen, when translated to stage the conceit becomes little more than a frantic, under-imagined jukeboxer, and only occasionally a well-performed one. Four-city tour will likely rake in the cash and merit a reprise, but whether it deserves it is a different matter." [...] Though he did, again, note Riley's [...] "solid" [...] performances and calling Lea Michele [...] "the most obvious pro" [...] claiming her songs were performed [...] "with power and presence".
