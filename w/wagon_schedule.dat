40|$|A railway {{organisation}} {{is designed}} to provide economies of scale in a country’s freight traffic system and it is on this understanding that a need has been observed to prompt a design for a Freight Traffic Planning and Rolling Stock Scheduling Management Tool that will ensure optimum allocation and utilisation of resources, and timely delivery of customer goods. Literature related to freight traffic planning and <b>wagon</b> <b>scheduling</b> is explored in an attempt to find the best solution alternatives in order to develop a programme for freight traffic planning and <b>wagon</b> <b>scheduling</b> that will optimise resource utilisation. However, several aspects have to be additionally taken into account, such as cyclic departures of the trains from stations, available loads at stations, types of wagons required for given commodity types, destinations, locomotive types, and transfer of wagons between or at stations i. e. attaching and or detaching wagons in transit. The model is formulated as a goal programming problem, and solutions are obtained using VB. Net on ORACLE Database. The solutions give proper knowledge of available business (freight traffic) at any station nationwide; knowledge and position of all wagons by types at anytime; proper allocation and <b>scheduling</b> of <b>wagons</b> to take available business in terms of priority and monitored wagon distribution nationwide. Locomotive and Wagon availability revolved around 74 and 66 % respectively. Computational results for several test instances are presented...|$|R
40|$|The <b>wagon</b> flow <b>scheduling</b> plays a very {{important}} role in transportation activities in railway bureau. However, it is difficult to implement in the actual decision-making process of <b>wagon</b> flow <b>scheduling</b> that compiled under certain environment, because of the interferences of uncertain information, such as train arrival time, train classify time, train assemble time, and flexible train-size limitation. Based on existing research results, considering the stochasticity of all kinds of train operation time and fuzziness of train-size limitation of the departure train, aimed at maximizing the satisfaction of departure train-size limitation and minimizing the wagon residence time at railway station, a stochastic chance-constrained fuzzy multiobjective model for flexible <b>wagon</b> flow <b>scheduling</b> problem is established in this paper. Moreover, a hybrid intelligent algorithm based on ant colony optimization (ACO) and genetic algorithm (GA) is also provided to solve this model. Finally, the rationality and effectiveness of the model and algorithm are verified through a numerical example, and the results prove that the accuracy of the train work plan could be improved by the model and algorithm; consequently, it has a good robustness and operability...|$|R

5|$|Goods-only trains were a rarity, and {{the usual}} {{practice}} was to attach goods <b>wagons</b> to any <b>scheduled</b> passenger services.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} calculating {{the plan for}} the {{formation}} of trains in the directions is to calculate the average daily costs of car-hours for the accumulation of trains. The article gives a detailed analysis of the process of accumulation of wagons for the composition in the sorting park of the station based on the average <b>wagon</b> accumulation <b>schedule.</b> New formulas are proposed for determining the average daily cost of car-hours for accumulation. The calculation is given and the av-erage statistical values of the investigated quantities are determined. Practical significance: is the detailed consideration of the process of accumulation of cars taking into account the arrival of individual groups of cars, which determine the costs of car-hours for the accumulation of wagons...|$|R
40|$|Dispatch {{of steel}} {{products}} by railways from the mills {{of an integrated}} steel plant, producing variety of products is a complex process with a constraint of strictly adhering to the permissible Wagon Turnaround Times (WTT). This operation faces further challenges when the WTT is proposed to be brought down by 75 % while additional mills are being added for capacity expansion. This paper presents how re-engineering of the dispatch operations using simulation helped in reducing the WTT to the desired level. Our approach was to use a flexible push-pull based dispatch scheduling instead of the current pull and wait model. Our recommendations included decoupling railways operations from the internal mills there-by avoiding wagon set breaks and reassembly, investing in optimum number of captive locomotives and <b>wagon</b> sets, <b>scheduling</b> mechanism for captive locomotives, creation of an intermediate storage to stack products according to dispatch schedules and ensuring just-in-time material availability for dispatch. ...|$|R

The road had turnoffs (as it was not wide enough for horse-drawn vehicles to pass each other).

Railway companies are looking for improved solutions to the allocation of their resources. The resource allocation process can be subdivided in the three phases <b>wagon</b> circulation, engine <b>scheduling</b> and crew scheduling. We outline the interaction of these three planning phases and present in detail an optimizing approach for specialized crew scheduling problem. {{in order to be}} close to reality, various new aspects like transfer of crews, different and limited crews and a high number of technical and legal restrictions have to be considered. The develoded optimization model is based on a network and formulated as a set covering problem with additional crew limits...|$|R

Mary notices this but conceals it from the guards. He eventually {{turns out to be}} Jem, Joss’ younger brother, a horse thief. Later, when she takes a walk over the moor, Mary encounters the vicar of Altarnun, the reverend Francis Davey, who escorts her back to the inn. Visiting him later at his church she finds out that he is much interested in local lore and mythology. Mary confides in him what she has learned of illegal activity at the inn. However, she only later learns the whole truth about their wrecking activity when her uncle confesses to it in a drunken stupor.|$|R

It was {{unveiled}} as a concept in June 2013 and in final production form at the September 2013 Indonesia International Motor Show. Its production has started from September 2013 at the Tambun, Bekasi Plant for sales in the Indonesian domestic market and Pakistani market and was launched in October 2013. The Karimun <b>Wagon</b> R is <b>scheduled</b> to meet the LCGC approval requirements by realizing low fuel consumption and increasing the local procurement rate. Its official name is Suzuki Indomobil Karimun Wagon R. It comes with 3 trims : GA as standard, GL, Dilago and GX with better equipment such as Roof Rail, sporty cluster meter and power windows, while under seat tray and keyless entry key are for GX trims only.|$|R
