5000|$|Breaststroke: {{performed}} {{face down}} in the water without rotating the torso. The arms stay in the water and move synchronously, while the legs perform a <b>whipkick.</b> It is possible to keep the head elevated out of the water throughout the stroke, although the head usually dips in and out.|$|E
50|$|The {{technique}} {{consists of}} approaching the victim {{from behind and}} below to minimize risk and maximize control; encircling the victim's waist or hips with one arm; and supporting the victim's buttocks or thigh on your hip. This ensures that the victim's head and shoulders are clear of the water while you swim to safety with a one-arm pull and either <b>whipkick</b> or eggbeater kick. The rescuer should attempt to keep his or her head clear of the surface to reassure the victim while moving to safety. This carry is used only over short distances where safety can be reached within 10-15 m and there is back-up help available.|$|E
