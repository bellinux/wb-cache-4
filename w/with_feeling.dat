5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s Donen signed a non-exclusive, three-film deal with Columbia Pictures. His first film under this {{contract}} was Once More, <b>with</b> <b>Feeling!</b> in 1960. Adapted by Harry Kurnitz {{from his own}} stage play, the film was shot in Paris and starred Yul Brynner and Kay Kendall. Brynner plays a tyrannical orchestra conductor whose mistress (Kendall) grows tired of his tantrums and plots to marry him in order to quickly divorce him for his money. Kendall was terminally ill with leukemia during the shoot and died before its release. The film was not successful financially or critically.|$|E
5|$|Louis Pojman has {{suggested}} four strong influences on Kant's ethics. The {{first is the}} Lutheran sect Pietism, to which Kant's parents subscribed. Pietism emphasised honesty and moral living over doctrinal belief, more concerned <b>with</b> <b>feeling</b> than rationality. Kant believed that rationality is required, but {{that it should be}} concerned with morality and good will. Second is the political philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose work, The Social Contract, influenced Kant's view on the fundamental worth of human beings. Pojman also cites contemporary ethical debates as influential to the development of Kant's ethics. Kant favoured rationalism over empiricism, which meant he viewed morality as a form of knowledge, rather than something based on human desire. Natural law (the belief that the moral law is determined by nature) and intuitionism (the belief that humans have intuitive awareness of objective moral truths) were, according to Pojman, also influential for Kant.|$|E

Both the film and the album received widespread critical acclaim.|$|E

25|$|Skeleton Tree was {{recorded}} over several sessions from late 2014to early 2016, with Nick Cave and Warren Ellis producing the album; Cave financed the recording sessions himself. Initial recording began at Retreat Recording Studios in Brighton, England in late 2014, with Kevin Paul {{as the main}} recording engineer. Near {{the end of the}} sessions, Cave's 15-year-old son Arthur died after falling from the nearby Ovingdean Gap in July 2015. Cave and Ellis returned to the studio two weeks later to review the material recorded for Skeleton Tree. Most of the basic tracks for each song and a majority of Cave's vocals were completed by this time. The album's sessions then resumed at La Frette Studios in La Frette-sur-Seine, France in autumn 2015, with Nick Launay engineering and co-producing the sessions. Final overdubs for Skeleton Tree were recorded at Air Studios in London, with engineers Kevin Paul and Jake Jackson, in early 2016. Several performances from the final recording sessions were shot for the album's accompanying documentary film One More Time <b>with</b> <b>Feeling,</b> directed by Andrew Dominik.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{backlash}} toward the film, some critics praised Sevigny's performance; Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said, [...] "Actresses {{have been asked}} and even bullied into performing similar acts for filmmakers since the movies began, usually behind closed doors. Ms. Sevigny isn't hiding behind anyone's desk. She says her lines <b>with</b> <b>feeling</b> and puts her iconoclasm right out there where everyone can see it; she may be nuts, but she's also unforgettable." [...] Roger Ebert, although critical of The Brown Bunny, nevertheless said that Sevigny brought [...] "a truth and vulnerability" [...] to the film.|$|E

Brandon Lewis of Blogcritics commended how she makes maximum use of the power in her lower register, which according to him, is very effective with the song's [...] "relatively short, punchy phrasing". Ian Walker of AbsolutePunk commented that Beyoncé and [...] "the backing production" [...] ebb and flow as the song proceeds, and added that toward the end, she channels her inner Mariah Carey and ultimately [...] "puts the older star to shame". Similarly, Craig Jenkins of Prefix Magazine praised how effortlessly Beyoncé scats along with the multi-octave guitar solo.|$|E
500|$|In most {{episodes of}} low back pain, a {{specific}} underlying cause is not identified or even looked for, {{with the pain}} believed {{to be due to}} mechanical problems such as muscle or joint strain. If the pain does not go away with conservative treatment or if it is accompanied by [...] "red flags" [...] such as unexplained weight loss, fever, or significant problems <b>with</b> <b>feeling</b> or movement, further testing may be needed to look for a serious underlying problem. In most cases, imaging tools such as X-ray computed tomography are not useful and carry their own risks. Despite this, the use of imaging in low back pain has increased. Some low back pain is caused by damaged intervertebral discs, and the straight leg raise test is useful to identify this cause. In those with chronic pain, the pain processing system may malfunction, causing large amounts of pain in response to non-serious events.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, [...] "Together When..." [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most music critics. Bradley Stern, head writer from MuuMuse, awarded the song {{a maximum of}} ten points and labelled {{it one of the}} best tracks on Guilty. He commented, [...] "Finally, a ballad <b>with</b> <b>feeling!...</b> Call me sadistic, but the best moments in an Ayumi song are the parts where it sounds like she’s about to break ("Memorial Address"). This song is full of those moments." [...] In a similar review, a staff member at Channel-Ai awarded it five stars out of five, and believed that the song is one [...] "of her strongest ballads". The reviewer further explained, [...] "The emotion within the ballad is so infectious that the audience cannot help but feel empathy towards Ayumi." [...] A staff member at CD Journal enjoyed the song, labeling it a [...] "beautiful performance" [...] by Hamasaki; the reviewer also complimented the instrumentation and production, and how it [...] "melted together comfortably".|$|E

500|$|Initial {{reviews for}} Night Trap on the Sega CD were mixed. The title is notable {{for being the}} first {{interactive}} movie on the system and was thus seen as breaking new ground {{in terms of both}} genre and technology. Critics were quick to point out the game's [...] qualities that were reminiscent of teen horror movies. The staff at Sega Force felt that playing the game was like [...] "directing your own B movie. Night Trap makes you feel part of the game." [...] Along <b>with</b> <b>feeling</b> like a B movie, critics identified the [...] "warped" [...] and [...] "tacky" [...] sense of humor as helping the game's appeal and adding to its charm. From a technological perspective, the video quality was praised for being high-quality and smooth, although the Sega CD's low color capabilities were identified as a weakness. The most common point of complaint was the gameplay. Some critics cited it for being boring and shallow because it mostly involved pressing one button at the right time to trap the enemies. The staff at Computer and Video Games felt Night Trap was reminiscent of Dragon's Lair (1983) and Space Ace (1984) and shared the same issues those games had with gameplay just being a matter of hitting buttons in the right moments.|$|E
500|$|The {{first to}} speak was the Speaker of the House of Commons (later Master of the Rolls), Sir Edward Philips, who {{described}} the intent behind the plot in lurid detail. [...] He {{was followed by}} the Attorney-General Sir Edward Coke, who began with a long speech—the content of which was heavily influenced by Salisbury—that included a denial that the King had ever made any promises to the Catholics. [...] Monteagle's part in the discovery of the plot was welcomed, and denunciations of the 1603 mission to Spain featured strongly. [...] Fawkes's protestations that Gerard knew nothing of the plot were omitted from Coke's speech. [...] The foreign powers, when mentioned, were accorded due respect, but the priests were accursed, their behaviour analysed and criticised wherever possible. [...] There was little doubt, according to Coke, that the plot had been invented by the Jesuits. [...] Garnet's meeting with Catesby, at which the former was said to have absolved the latter of any blame in the plot, was proof enough that the Jesuits were central to the conspiracy; [...] according to Coke the Gunpowder Plot would always be known as the Jesuit Treason. Coke spoke <b>with</b> <b>feeling</b> of the probable fate of the Queen {{and the rest of the}} King's family, and of the innocents who would have been caught up in the explosion.|$|E
500|$|Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama {{gave the}} film 4 (out of 5) stars, {{saying that it}} was [...] "attention-grabbing from {{inception}} till conclusion. The drama only soars higher and the complex love story gets more and more gripping as the conflict between the characters come to the fore." [...] Rachit Gupta of Filmfare gave it 4 (out of 5) stars: [...] "At a gracious 3 hours runtime, JTHJ feels like an epic love story. And it is just that. JTHJ is the perfect adieu to a hallmark career. It is the best romantic film made in this generation." [...] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave it 3.5 (out of 5) stars: [...] "Despite the lovey-dovey nothingness that drives the plot, Jab Tak Hai Jaan has more substance than most romantic films that come out of Bollywood." [...] Meena Iyer of The Times of India rated it 3.5 (out of 5) stars, saying: [...] "Every frame is picture-perfect, the emotions are well nuanced. But there is one inherent flawthe story by Aditya Chopra is hackneyed." [...] Subhash Jha (also from The Times of India) said, [...] "Jab Tak Hai Jaan makes {{you fall in love with}} love all over again." [...] Anupama Chopra of the Hindustan Times gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "Jab Tak Hai Jaan is too tangled to transport you. But I recommend that you see it. Because only Yash Chopra could make heartache so attractive and ennobling that his characters wear it like a badge of honor." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "I'm going with three out of five for the late Yash Chopra's Jab Tak Hai Jaan. Despite its many script problems, it's a consistently watchable film that oozes <b>with</b> <b>feeling</b> and real emotion. A fitting swan song." [...] OPEN magazine gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars, praising Yash Chopra's direction. Ajit Duara called it [...] "a deeply-felt cinematic perspective from 80 years of living." [...] Raja Sen of Rediff.com gave it 3 (out of 5) stars, saying: [...] "As a swan-song for the master director, Jab Tak Hai Jaan might only be a middling effort. But then, sometimes, all we need is a Khan-song." [...] Shabana Ansari of Daily News and Analysis gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "If you must, watch Jab Tak Hai Jaan for Shah Rukh, who can still convey love and passion in a fleeting look or a dimpled smile; and for Yash Chopra who gave us some of the most enduring romances of all times." ...|$|E
