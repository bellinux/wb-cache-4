40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{provides}} {{a synthesis of}} work by the writers that has the objective of developing a new working stress method for the calculation of reinforcement loads in geosynthetic reinforced soil walls. As a precursor to this objective, careful back-analyses of a database of instrumented and monitored full-scale field and laboratory walls are used {{to demonstrate that the}} current Simplified Method used in North America results in excessively conservative estimates of the volume of reinforcement required to generate satisfactory long-term wall performance. The new method is calibrated against measured in-situ <b>wall</b> <b>reinforcement</b> loads using a careful interpretation of reinforcement strains and the conversion of strain to load using a suitably selected reinforcement stiffness value. A novel feature of the method is to design the <b>wall</b> <b>reinforcement</b> so that the soil within the wall backfill is prevented from reaching a failure limit state, consistent with the notion of working stress conditions. ...|$|E

40|$|Plant {{cells are}} {{surrounded}} by cell walls. Cell walls provide strength to protect and shape the cells they surround. Structural strength is particularly important in the water conducting tissue of the xylem. Water and nutrient transport is driven by water evaporation at the leaves, generating a negative pressure in the tubular xylem vessels. Patterned cell <b>wall</b> <b>reinforcements</b> are deposited during {{the development of these}} cells that function in counteracting the negative pressure. The cell <b>wall</b> <b>reinforcements</b> are deposited in a diverse number of patterns. Secondary cell wall thickenings in the form of rings and spirals provide physical strength, while allowing elongation of the surrounding tissue in the newly grown plant parts. Plant cell walls consist of a mixture of polysaccharides, forming an intricate network with cellulose microfibrils as the main load-bearing component. The cortical microtubule array dictates the direction and location of newly polymerised cellulose microfibrils in primary cell wall deposition. In this thesis, I focus on understanding if and how microtubule dynamics control the patterning of secondary cell wall position. Which self-organizing properties of microtubules change to generate a microtubule pattern and how is this pattern translated to a patterned cell wall deposition during protoxylem formation? We measured the microtubule dynamicity parameters growth velocity, shrink velocity, rescue rate and catastrophe rate which are important for the self-organizational capability of the microtubule array. We show that the rescue and catastrophe rate increases in the microtubule gap area compared to the microtubule band area. Via stochastic computer simulations we show that a 2 -fold increase of the catastrophe rate is sufficient to generate microtubule bands and gaps. Furthermore we investigate if gravity is a factor able to influence the reorganization of the microtubule array during protoxylem formation. Altogether, the results indicate that local changes in the rescue and catastrophe rate are responsible for the generation of microtubule bands and gaps over time during protoxylem formation...|$|R

40|$|Millions {{of square}} feet of {{mechanically}} stabilized earth retaining wall are constructed annually in the United States. When used in highway fill applications in conjunction with bridges, these MSE walls are typically constructed with a roadside barrier system supported {{on the edge of}} the wall. This barrier system generally consists of a traffic barrier or bridge rail placed on a continuous footing or structural slab. The footing is intended to reduce the influence of barrier impact loads on the retaining wall system by distributing the load over a wide area and to provide stability for the barrier against sliding or overturning. The proper design of the roadside barrier, the structural slab, and the MSE wall system requires a good understanding of relevant failure modes, how barrier impact loads are transferred into the wall system, and the magnitude and distribution of these loads. In this study, a procedure is developed that provides guidance for designing: 1. the barrier-moment slab, 2. the <b>wall</b> <b>reinforcement,</b> and 3. the wall panels. These design guidelines are developed in terms of AASHTO LRFD procedures. The research approach consisted of engineering analyses, finite element analyses, static load tests, full-scale dynamic impact tests, and a full-scale vehicle crash test. It was concluded that a 44. 5 kN (10 kips) equivalent static load is appropriate for the stability design of the barrier-moment slab system. This will result in much more economical design than systems developed using the 240 kN (54 kips) load that some user agencies are using.

And there is no specific and quantitative method to ensure that transfer structures can “resist severe earthquake without collapse”. In this paper, the philosophy of capacity design is introduced into the design of transfer-storey structures and a practical design method for transfer structures under severe earthquake is presented. Through push-over analysis, various limit states of coupled shear walls are disclosed. Parameters that influence significantly the structure behavior such as integer coefficient of coupled shear <b>walls,</b> <b>reinforcement</b> ratio of coupling beams and height-width ratio of shear walls are highlighted.
