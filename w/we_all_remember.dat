6000|$|William Ockham was an Englishman, {{and died}} about 1347; {{but the place}} and year of his birth are not clearly ascertained. He was styled the Invincible Doctor, and wrote bitterly against Pope John XXII. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>remember</b> Butler's account of these worthies:-- ...|$|E
60|$|He, too, in {{his best}} days, always lived with his characters;--and he, too, as he {{gradually}} ceased to have the power of doing so, ceased to charm.

5000|$|Granville Again was {{retired from}} racing after his run at Newcastle in 1996 {{and spent the}} {{remainder}} of his life at Eric Scarth's property in Northumberland. He died in 2003 at the age of seventten. Martin Pipe said [...] "Granville was an absolute star... he will be sorely missed and <b>we</b> shall <b>all</b> <b>remember</b> our friend with great affection".|$|R
60|$|Being now at home again, and alone, {{the only}} person in the house awake, my {{thoughts}} are drawn back, by a fascination which I do not care to resist, to my own childhood. I begin to consider, what do <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>remember</b> best upon the branches of the Christmas Tree of our own young Christmas days, by which we climbed to real life.|$|E

Of course <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>remember</b> how jealous she was of other girls when Daren went with her. But I think now it's because she's sorry for Daren. So am I. He was such a fool. Fanchon swears no nice girl in Middleville will ever dance that new camel-walk dance in public again." ...|$|E
60|$|But Dorothea {{remembered it}} to the last with the {{vividness}} with which <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>remember</b> epochs in our experience when some dear expectation dies, or some new motive is born. Today {{she had begun to}} see that she had been under a wild illusion in expecting a response to her feeling from Mr. Casaubon, and she had felt the waking of a presentiment {{that there might be a}} sad consciousness in his life which made as great a need on his side as on her own.|$|E
60|$|Did {{you ever}} remark, my friends, that the Bible says hardly any thing about religion--that it never praises {{religious}} people? This is very curious. Would to God <b>we</b> would <b>all</b> <b>remember</b> it! The Bible {{speaks of a}} religious man only once, and of religion only twice, except where it speaks of the Jews' religion to condemn it, and shews what an empty, blind, useless thing it was.|$|R

50|$|His {{concern with}} death {{can also be}} seen in two biographical essays: Det lånte Lys (1995) and Langs Vinden (1998), one of which depicts a cancer-stricken friend living on {{borrowed}} time but nonetheless slowly approaching his end. The other is a kind of fable, describing a journey from the south of France and up through Germany to Denmark with flashbacks showing how houses along the route have disappeared and their inhabitants have disappeared. The images are all the more meaningful as they show old cars and clothing fashions <b>we</b> can <b>all</b> <b>remember.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>remember</b> Burke's curious {{assertion}} {{that there were}} 80,000 incorrigible jacobins in England. Mr. Colquhoun is equally precise {{in the number of}} beggars, prostitutes, and thieves in the City of London. Mercetinus, who wrote under Lewis XV. seems to have afforded the precedent; he assures his readers, that by an accurate calculation there were 50,000 incorrigible atheists in the City of Paris! Atheism then may have been a co-cause of the French revolution; but it should not be burthened on it, as its monster-child.|$|E
6000|$|... "This, then, I have to add, my Lord, that I, {{as all the}} world, {{remarked that}} Richard de Montfort consorted much with Sir Reginald de Ferrieres, who, as <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>remember,</b> {{is the son of}} a family deeply {{concerned}} in the Mad Parliament. By Sir Reginald, on his arrival at Castel San Giovanni, a messenger is despatched, bearing letters to the Hospital at Florence, and it is immediately after his arrival there, that the two Montforts speed from the Maremma to the unhappy and bloody Mass at Viterbo." ...|$|E

Think what it means to us!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Everybody {{joined in}} this chorus, the Frenchman with the rest, who said, [...] "he loved to laugh meme {{when he did}} not know why." [...] And now came the moment of the evening, when Clive, {{according}} to Lord Kew's saying, behaved so well and prevented Barnes from incurring a great danger. In truth, what Mr. Clive did or said amounted exactly to nothing. What moments can <b>we</b> not <b>all</b> <b>remember</b> in our lives when it would have been so much wittier and wiser to say and do nothing? ...|$|R
30|$|<b>We</b> <b>all</b> still <b>remember</b> the Björk-Shiley valve, {{where an}} {{unexpected}} mortality {{due to a}} construction fault was {{a reason for the}} FDA to withdraw the valve from the market. We have to see how this will develop, but for the time being we should take this warning very seriously without “shooting the messenger” by accusing him of data mining and prematurity. Science is not fake news and the mere fact that one cannot explain a certain finding in a study does not mean it is untrue.|$|R

60|$|Besides {{his town}} palace, the Marquis had castles and palaces in various {{quarters}} of the three kingdoms, whereof the descriptions {{may be found in}} the road-books--Castle Strongbow, with its woods, on the Shannon shore; Gaunt Castle, in Carmarthenshire, where Richard II was taken prisoner--Gauntly Hall in Yorkshire, where I have been informed there were two hundred silver teapots for the breakfasts of the guests of the house, with everything to correspond in splendour; and Stillbrook in Hampshire, which was my lord's farm, an humble place of residence, of which <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>remember</b> the wonderful furniture which was sold at my lord's demise by a late celebrated auctioneer.|$|E
60|$|In this busy {{progressive}} age {{there are}} no heroes of the kind so dear to all lovers of chivalry and romance. There are heroes, perhaps, {{but they are the}} patient sad-faced kind, of whom few take cognizance as they hurry onward. But cannot <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>remember</b> some one who suffered greatly, who accomplished great deeds, who died on the battlefield--some one around whose name lingers a halo of glory? Few of us are so unfortunate that we cannot look backward on kith or kin and thrill with love and reverence as we dream of an act of heroism or martyrdom which rings down the annals of time like the melody of the huntsman's horn, as it peals out on a frosty October morn purer and sweeter with each succeeding note.|$|E
6000|$|This is {{our view}} of the law on the point; and, we dare to say, so will it be ruled. Perhaps, however, in reality, all that he tells us about his youth is rather with a view to {{increase}} our wonder than to soften our censures. He possibly means to say, [...] "See how a minor can write! This poem was actually composed by a young man of eighteen, and this by one of only sixteen!" [...] But, alas! <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>remember</b> the poetry of Cowley at ten, and Pope at twelve; and so far from hearing, with any degree of surprise, that very poor verses were written by a youth from his leaving school to his leaving college, inclusive, we really believe this to be the most common of all occurrences; that it happens in the life of nine men in ten who are educated in England; and that the tenth man writes better verse than Lord Byron.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{must take}} a note of the date. It is one <b>we</b> shall <b>remember</b> <b>all</b> our lives. It is the 25th of November, and we will keep it up as a day of festivity and rejoicing, {{as long as we}} live." ...|$|R
40|$|Grades matter. Students {{care about}} them, for reasons both {{objective}} and subjective. Objectively, grades influence {{a wide variety}} of resources such as access to scholarships, awards, advanced education and employment. Grades are also often seen as the personal judgment of the professor upon the student: <b>we</b> <b>all,</b> perhaps, <b>remember</b> the warm glow of a “Well done! Fine work! ” as well as the sting of a “Not up to expectations. ” Moreover, a substantial body of research demonstrates that how students learn, and what they learn, is profoundly affected by how they are assessed (see for example Carnoy and Loeb 2002...|$|R

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>remember</b> {{the fairy}} tales {{of science in}} our infancy, which played with the {{supposition}} that large animals could jump {{in the proportion of}} small ones. If an elephant were as strong as a grasshopper, he could (I suppose) spring clean out of the Zoological Gardens and alight trumpeting upon Primrose Hill. If a whale could leap from the sea like a trout, perhaps men might look up and see one soaring above Yarmouth like the winged island of Laputa. Such natural energy, though sublime, might certainly be inconvenient, and much of this inconvenience attended the gaiety and good intentions of the man in green. He was too large for everything, because he was lively as well as large. By a fortunate physical provision, most very substantial creatures are also reposeful; and middle-class boarding-houses in the lesser parts of London are not built for a man as big as a bull and excitable as a kitten.|$|E
60|$|It is most certain, {{that the}} {{repeated}} losses {{suffered by the}} States, {{in little more than}} two months after they had withdrawn themselves from the Queen's assistance, did wholly disconcert their counsels;[20] and their prudence (as it is usual) began to forsake them with their good fortune. They were so weak as to be still deluded by their friends in England, who continued to give them hopes of some mighty and immediate resource from hence; for when the Duke of Ormonde had been about a month in Ghent, he received a letter from the Maréchal de Villars, to inform him, that the Dutch generals, taken at Denain, had told the maréchal publicly, of a sudden revolution expected in Britain; that particularly the Earl of Albemarle and Mons. Hompesch discoursed very freely of it, and that nothing was more commonly talked of in Holland. It was then likewise confidently reported in Ghent, that the Queen was dead; and <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>remember</b> what rumour flew about here at the very same time, as if Her Majesty's health were in a bad condition.|$|E
60|$|As to the {{disposition}} of the opposite party, <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>remember,</b> that {{the removal of the}} last ministry was brought about by several degrees; through which means it happened, that they and their friends were hardly recovered out of one astonishment, before they fell into another. This scene lasted for some months, and was followed by a period of rage and despair, natural to those who reflect that they have lost a secure game, by their own rashness, folly, and want of common management, when, at the same time, they knew by experience, that a watchful and dexterous adversary lay ready to take the advantage. However, some time before the session, the heads of that party began to recollect themselves, and rally their forces, like an enemy who hath been beaten out of the field, but finds he is not pursued; for although the chiefs of this faction were thought to have but little esteem or friendship for each other, yet they perfectly agreed in one general end, of distressing, by all possible methods, the new administration, wherein if they could succeed so far as to put the Queen under any great necessity, another Parliament must be called, and perhaps the power[10] devolve again into their own hands.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>remembered</b> very {{distinctly}} Bulger's advent in Rattlesnake Camp. It {{was during}} the rainy season--a season singularly inducive to settled reflective impressions as we sat and smoked around the stove in Mosby's grocery. Like older and more civilized communities, we had our periodic waves of sentiment and opinion, with the exception {{that they were more}} evanescent with us, and as we had just passed through a fortnight of dissipation and extravagance, owing to a visit from some gamblers and speculators, we were now undergoing a severe moral revulsion, partly induced by reduced finances and partly by the arrival of two families with grownup daughters on the hill. It was raining, with occasional warm breaths, through the open window, of the southwest trades, redolent of the saturated spices of the woods and springing grasses, which perhaps were slightly inconsistent with the hot stove around which we had congregated. But the stove was only an excuse for our listless, gregarious gathering; warmth and idleness went well together, and it was currently accepted that we had caught from the particular reptile which gave its name to our camp much of its pathetic, lifelong search for warmth, and its habit of indolently basking in it.|$|R
6000|$|... "And if we {{meant to}} tell them and forgot {{to tell them}}," [...] I added, [...] "we will {{tell them that they}} ought not to want us to tell them a simple thing like that, as if they were mere babies. <b>We</b> must <b>remember</b> <b>all</b> these points." ...|$|R
50|$|Alline {{wrote and}} espoused many sound ideas whereas others {{moved into the}} realm of mysticism and some were simply convoluted. He taught that the souls of all {{humankind}} are emanations from the same Spirit, that these spirits along with the Angels had lived in a paradise with God. Furthermore, that Adam and Eve existed as one combined spirit. It was after the fall from heaven that Adam and humankind took on corporeal form and as a group participated in original sin. He further stated that all time; past, present and future, occur instantaneously and once the time of judgement comes <b>we</b> will <b>all</b> <b>remember</b> our participation in the act of original sin.|$|R
60|$|Indeed, {{the artist}} who really has {{suffered}} through the modern mounting of plays is not the dramatist at all, but the scene-painter proper. He is rapidly being displaced by the stage-carpenter. Now and then, at Drury Lane, I have seen beautiful old front cloths let down, as perfect as pictures some of them, and pure painter's work, {{and there are many}} which <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>remember</b> at other theatres, in front of which some dialogue was reduced to graceful dumb-show through the hammer and tin-tacks behind. But as a rule the stage is overcrowded with enormous properties, which are not merely far more expensive and cumbersome than scene-paintings, but far less beautiful, and far less true. Properties kill perspective. A painted door is more like a real door than a real door is itself, for the proper conditions of light and shade can be given to it; and the excessive use of built up structures always makes the stage too glaring, for as they have to be lit from behind, {{as well as from the}} front, the gas-jets become the absolute light of the scene instead of the means merely by which we perceive the conditions of light and shadow which the painter has desired to show us.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{it is not}} to {{be managed}} in that way, we must go down to the river bank and see whether there is {{anything}} to be done with one of the piers. If that is not possible, we must content ourselves with smashing things up generally on this side. Several of the trucks look to me to be full of ammunition, and there are eight with long cases which are no doubt rifles. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>remember</b> that terrific smash at Johannesburg, and though I don't say we could do such awful damage as there was there--for there were I don't know how many tons of dynamite exploded then, I think about fifty--still, it would be a heavy blow. Any amount of stores would be destroyed, some thousand of rifles, and, for aught I know, all those waggons with tarpaulins over them are full of cartridges. However, the bridge is the principal thing. We will stop here {{for an hour or two}} and examine every foot of the ground, so as to be able to find our way in the dark. We need not mind about the trucks now, we can examine their position to-morrow if we have to give up the idea of the bridge." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>remember</b> {{the terrible}} exclamation {{of the dying}} profligate, when a friend, to destroy what he {{supposed}} the hypochondriac idea of a spectre appearing in a certain shape at a given hour, placed before him a person dressed up in the manner he described. [...] "Mon Dieu!" [...] said the expiring sinner, who, it seems, saw both the real and polygraphic apparition, [...] "il y en a deux!" [...] The surprise of the Lord Keeper was scarcely less unpleasing at the duplication of the expected arrival; his mind misgave him strangely. There was no neighbour who would have approached so unceremoniously, {{at a time when}} ceremony was held in such respect. It must be Lady Ashton, said his conscience, and followed up the hint with an anxious anticipation of the purpose of her sudden and unannounced return. He felt that he was caught [...] "in the manner." [...] That the company in which she had so unluckily surprised him was likely to be highly distasteful to her, there was no question; and the only hope which remained for him was her high sense of dignified propriety, which, he trusted, might prevent a public explosion. But so active were his doubts and fears as altogether to derange his purposed ceremonial for the reception of the Marquis.|$|E
40|$|As {{former and}} perhaps still current students, <b>we</b> can <b>all</b> <b>remember</b> essays we’ve written, dioramas we’ve built, and posters we’ve pasted together. All these are forms of {{classroom}} narrative, a basic and important activity used by instructors to reinforce learning. The {{very fact that}} many of us can still remember these narratives decades later shows the success of this type of activity. The power of classroom narrative lies in the wide range of abilities it engages. Most importantly, narrative engages the student’s reflective and interpretive faculties. In producing a narrative artifact, students must internalize the classroom topic and most often also adopt a certain point of view about it. Narratives can also engage a wide range of expressive abilities. Fo...|$|R
6000|$|Something must {{be allowed}} for Boswell’s “rivalry for Johnson’s good [...] graces” with Oliver (as Sir Walter Scott has remarked), for Oliver [...] was {{intimate}} with the Doctor before his biographer was,—and as <b>we</b> [...] <b>all</b> <b>remember,</b> marched off with him to “take tea with Mrs. Williams” [...] before Boswell had advanced to that honourable degree of intimacy. [...] But, in truth, Boswell—though he perhaps showed more talent in his [...] delineation of the Doctor than is generally ascribed to him—had not [...] faculty to take a fair view of two great men at a time. Besides, [...] as Mr. Forster justly remarks, “he was impatient of Goldsmith from [...] the first hour of their acquaintance.”—Life and Adventures, p. [...] 292.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> should <b>all</b> <b>remember</b> {{that our}} pupils are, {{but a very}} short time, under our direct control. Even {{when they are in}} school, the most untiring {{vigilance}} will not enable us to watch, except for a very small portion of the time, any individual. Many hours of the day, too, they are entirely removed from our inspection, and a few months will take them away from us altogether. Subjecting them then to mere external restraint, is a very inadequate remedy for the moral evil, to which they are exposed. What we aim at, is to bring forward and strengthen an internal principle, which will act, when both parent and teacher are away, and control where external circumstances are all unfavorable.|$|R
