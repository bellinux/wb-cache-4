Recent advancements and results show that ERH can be an effective treatment method for bedrock. At an ERH site, the primary electrical current path is on the thin layer of water immediately adjacent to the soil or rock grains. Little current is carried by the water in the pore volume. It is not the pore fluid that dominates the electrical conductivity; it is the grain <b>wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> that dominates the electrical conductivity. Sedimentary rock will typically possess the thin layer of water required for current flow. This means ERH can effectively be used for treatment of sedimentary bedrock, which typically has significant primary porosity.|$|E

40|$|Two {{immiscible}} fluids {{flowing in}} parallel {{with respect to the}} interface separating them in a two-dimensional porous medium has been studied using a dynamic network model. Two immiscible fluids, one wetting and the other non-wetting moving in parallel is a complicated process that haven't gotten much attention. It is found that there is a competition between imbibition and drainage displacements at the pore-scale along the front separating the two fluids due to an external force driving both the fluids in the direction parallel to this front. Imbibition is the process where a <b>wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> displaces a non-wetting fluid, while drainage is when a non-wetting fluid displaces a <b>wetting</b> <b>fluid.</b> When an external force driving the system in the direction parallel to the front separating the two liquid is small, such that the capillary forces are much strong that viscous forces, we find that imbibition displacements will dominate along the front. The <b>wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> is found to displace the non-wetting such that the front separating the non-wetting fluid from the <b>wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> moves with a velocity proportional to the volumetric flow rate perpendicular to the imposed flow direction. A <b>wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> will prefer to displace a non-wetting fluid along narrow channels {{due to the fact that}} capillary forces provide suction in imbibition, as opposed to resistance in drainage. When the front is moving, we find that clusters of non-wetting fluids are left behind the front, concentrated in the widest part of the network. These cluster will not be able to be move as long as the external driving force is not large enough to overcome the the capillary forces holding back the cluster. <b>Wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> will flow in the space around the clusters. If the external driving force is large enough so that these clusters can be mobilized, then we'll have viscous forces start dominating, and there will be a mixture of imbibition and drainage depending on the local geometry and boundary conditions. If drainage starts dominating the front will stop moving and become unstable, and non-wetting fingers will start moving in the direction of the wetting liquid. If the driving force is strong enough, these fingers will break up into bubbles due to crossing wetting fluids, and non-wetting bubbles will start migrating into the <b>wetting</b> <b>fluid.</b> For special case of a band of non-wetting fluid surrounded by <b>wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> on both sides, we find that the <b>wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> will try to displace the non-wetting fluid from both sides simultaneously. If the external driving force is not strong enough so that the clusters broken off from either side can be mobilized, we find that both the fronts stabilize and stop moving. The non-wetting and <b>wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> will then flow by themselves as if they were part of its own effective network separated by the fluid-fluid front, without any influence from the other fluid. The two fronts will be stationary as long as the capillary forces are dominating over viscous forces. </p...|$|E

To determine how much gas that can be recovered in a reservoir it is important with good knowledge of the trapped gas saturation. This includes getting more information about trapped gas which demands more research in this area. Trapped gas saturation is recognized as {{an important factor in}} the process of recovering gas. In this project, literature has been studied and a lot of experimental work was done. Several papers have been read, and a basic knowledge of trapped gas, both what it is and how it can be determined, has been obtained. A main objective when reading was to gain knowledge about factors that affect the amount of trapped gas in a reservoir. In addition to reading about the theory, it has bee tested in the lab. The main purpose of the lab work was to see how rate change would affect the residual gas saturation, by using USS method. Spontaneous co-current imbibition experiments were also obtained. Six cores; three Berea plugs and three cores from the northern sea were chosen for execution of the experiments. In total 3 - 4 USS experiments were executed for every core, where an important area of study should have been to figure out how different pressure differences would affect the results. In addition one spontaneous imbibition experiment where done for each core. Normally water is used as the wetting phase. In this study IsoparL was chosen as the <b>wetting</b> <b>fluid</b> due to simplification factors in the lab. Previous studies of spontaneous imbibition experiments had shown good results when using IsoparL, so it was assumed that it could be used in USS experiments as well.

The goal of the present paper is to investigate experimentally and theoretically the role of capillary forces in filtration of fluids in porous media with inhomogeneous permeability and to learn how the porosity and permeability non-uniformity affects displacement and entrapment of <b>wetting</b> <b>fluids.</b> Microgravity environment having been chosen for the experimental investigations provides the possibility for upscaling pores, thus revealing the processes taking place at a pore level. The presence of capillary forces {{is the most important}} factor allowing water and solutions migration to the upper soil layers, thus delivering life to all the plants on the planet. The obtained knowledge of capillary-driven filtration mechanisms allows one to develop optimal irrigation strategies, which is most important in hot desert regions, and to prevent liquid contaminants migrating to the roots of plants. The paper contains the results illustrating the sensitivity of capillary forces to variations of porous media characteristics. The experimental results obtained for fluid imbibition into unsaturated artificial and natural porous media are compared. The mathematical model for multiphase filtration in porous media under non-equilibrium conditions is being developed along with experimental procedures to determine the influence of capillary forces and mixing fluxes. In contrast to the existing theories, the present model does not rely on relative permeability functions for phases.
