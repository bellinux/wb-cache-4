5|$|Döblin's 1924 {{science fiction}} novel recounts {{the course of}} human history from the 20th to the 27th century, portraying it as a catastrophic global {{struggle}} between technological mania, natural forces, and competing political visions. Berge Meere und Giganten (Mountains Seas and Giants) presciently invokes such topics as urbanization, the alienation from nature, ecological devastation, mechanization, the dehumanization of the modern world, as well as mass migration, globalization, totalitarianism, fanaticism, terrorism, state surveillance, genetic engineering, synthetic food, the breeding of humans, biochemical warfare, and others. Stylistically and structurally experimental, it {{was regarded as a}} difficult work <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>first</b> came out and has often polarized critics. Among others, Günter Grass has praised the novel's continued relevance and insight.|$|E

This was upgrade to TCCOR II on later that day, and TCCOR I the next day. The Navy and Air Force evacuated assets. Before the typhoon's arrival, officials advised residents to store water prior to the storm's arrival. About 2,100people in vulnerable wooden homes were evacuated to storm shelters set up in schools and public offices.|$|E

5|$|The I-211 was {{a direct}} descendent of the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-210 high-altitude fighter prototype, {{also known as the}} MiG-3-82 or MiG-9. Late in 1941, a {{decision}} was made to phase out production of the Mikulin AM-35A engine used by the MiG-1 and MiG-3 in favor of the Mikulin AM-38 engine used in the Ilyushin Il-2. The MiG design team had already created a version of the MiG-3 called the I-210, using a Shvetsov ASh-82 radial engine instead of the inline, liquid-cooled engine. A number of changes were made in order to accommodate the larger circumference of the radial engine, but the redesign of the engine cowling was a failure and the I-210 proved to be slower than the Yak-1 or the LaGG-3 <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>first</b> flew on 23 July 1941.|$|E

It lost {{its status as a}} three-starred restaurant in the 2016 guide due to renovation preventing it from being open for assessment. The restaurant regained three stars in the following year's Michelin guide.|$|E
5|$|The actors' union Equity had {{actively}} {{fought against}} the introduction of TV recording since the 1950s, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>first</b> became a practical proposition. Before workable television recording was developed, if a broadcaster wished to repeat a programme (usually a one-off play), he had to re-hire the actors to perform it again, live, for additional fees. Equity's concern was that if broadcasters kept recordings of the original performances, {{they would be able}} to re-broadcast them indefinitely, which would reduce the amount of new production and threaten the livelihoods of its members. Although Equity could not prevent recording altogether, it added standard clauses to its members' contracts that stipulated that recordings could only be repeated a limited number of times within a specific timeframe, and deliberately set the fees for further use so high that broadcasters would consider it unjustifiable to spend so much money repeating an old programme rather than making a new one. Consequently, recordings whose repeat rights had expired were considered to be of no further domestic use to the broadcasters.|$|E

5|$|<b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>first</b> {{emerges from}} its egg, the young red-throated loon {{is covered with}} fine soft down feathers. Primarily dark brown to dark grey above, it is {{slightly}} paler {{on the sides of}} its head and neck, as well as on its throat, chest, and flanks, with a pale grey lower breast and belly. Within weeks, this first down is replaced by a second, paler set of down feathers, which are in turn replaced by developing juvenile feathers. The juvenile's plumage {{is similar to that of}} the adult, though with a few distinguishing features. It has a darker forehead and neck, with heavy speckling on the sides of the neck and the throat. Its back is browner and less speckled, and its underparts are tinged with brown. Its eyes are reddish-brown, and its beak is a pale grey. Though some young birds hold this plumage until mid-winter, many quickly become virtually indistinguishable from adults, except for their paler bills.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>first</b> opened, {{the ground}} had few {{facilities}} for either player or spectator. Uncovered terracing surrounded the pitch, and a hut acted as the players' changing room. A small but well-appointed covered wooden stand {{was built on}} the Coventry Road side, and over the years the terracing was enlarged to raise the capacity to around 30,000. In 1895, the football club bought the lease to the ground, which had 11 years remaining, for a sum of £275. Two years later, they paid £90 to their near neighbours, Aston Villa Football Club, for an old grandstand from Villa's former Wellington Road ground in Perry Barr. The club transported it piece by piece, and re-erected it as a terrace cover behind the goal at the Muntz Street end. No other major improvements were made, nor did the club ever move their administrative offices to the site, instead maintaining premises in Corporation Street, in Birmingham city centre.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>first</b> opened, {{traffic on}} the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike was light. By the 1970s, traffic along the roadway would {{increase}} with {{the completion of the}} connecting I-80 and the rising popularity of the Poconos as a vacation destination. As a result, the two-lane Lehigh Tunnel faced serious congestion. Plans were made to either bypass the tunnel or add a second tube. The turnpike commission decided it would build a second tunnel as the cost was lower than building a bypass. In 1988, a $37 million contract was awarded to build the second tube. Groundbreaking for the tunnel took place on February 14, 1989, with Governor Robert P. Casey in attendance. Excavation of the new tunnel began in July of that year. Construction of the second tube utilized the New Austrian Tunnelling method, which reduced the cost of the tunnel by $5 to $6 million. It was the first tunnel in the United States to use this construction method. The second tube at Lehigh Tunnel opened on November 22, 1991, with Governor Casey in attendance leading a line of antique cars. Construction of the tunnel cost $45 million. The new tube is used for southbound traffic while the original tube carries northbound traffic. The newer tunnel is wider, higher, and brighter than the original.|$|E
