500|$|In February 2010 when {{accompanying}} the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on a three-day visit to Saudi Arabia, he said [...] "We feel that Saudi Arabia {{has a long}} and close relationship with Pakistan, that makes Saudi Arabia even more a valuable interlocutor for us. When <b>we</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> about our experience, Saudi Arabia listens as somebody who is {{not in any way}} an enemy of Pakistan, but a friend of Pakistan and, therefore, will listen with sympathy and concern to a matter of this nature". He was asked whether India expected Saudi Arabia, given its close ties with Islamabad, to help address the terror threat from Pakistan. The remark about Saudi Arabia being a [...] "valuable interlocutor" [...] raised a strong reaction within the Indian political circle. The Pakistani press even went on to report that he had proposed that Saudi Arabia play a mediator's role in improving India's relationship with Pakistan. In response, Tharoor denied that 'interlocutor' meant 'mediator', and tweeted an explanation, saying, [...] "An [...] is someone you speak to. If I speak to you, you are my interlocutor. I mentioned the Saudis as our interlocutors, i.e. the people we are here to speak to".|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} Gilligan Unbound, American {{literary}} critic Paul Cantor described how [...] "Thirty Minutes Over Tokyo" [...] references and mocks {{several aspects of}} Japanese and American culture, as well as differences between the two. At a sumo wrestling match, Bart and Homer encounter the Japanese emperor, Akihito. After Homer throws him into a trunk of sumo thongs, Bart and Homer are put in jail, {{where they have to}} re-enact a kabuki play about the forty-seven Ronin, do origami, flower arranging and meditation. After Marge bails them out, Bart and Homer can speak fluent Japanese, and have fully absorbed, as Cantor writes, the [...] "exclusionary" [...] character of the Japanese culture, as Homer asks Bart (in Japanese, with English subtitles): [...] "Should <b>we</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> [...] the secret to inner peace?", to which Bart replies (still in Japanese), [...] "No, they are foreign devils." [...] The episode also references the Japanese's adaption to American culture, and is, according to Cantor, [...] "filled" [...] with signs of how eagerly Japanese have taken to American culture. In one scene, the Simpsons eat at a restaurant called Americatown, filled with US memorabilia and having only American items on the menu. Another scene shows director Woody Allen filming a commercial for Japanese television.|$|E

2500|$|Hacker's {{political}} party is never explicitly stated - a deliberate ploy by the series' creators {{to prevent the}} show from having a partisan affiliation. This begins in very first scene of the 'Yes Minister' pilot episode, where the victorious Hacker's party rosette is white, {{as opposed to the}} red (for Labour) and blue (for the Conservatives) rosettes worn by the other candidates. The Labour and Conservative parties are eventually compared in The National Education Service, when Sir Humphrey tells Bernard, [...] "When there is a Labour government, the education authorities tell them that comprehensives abolish the class system and when there's a Tory government <b>we</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> that it's the cheapest way of providing mass education; to Labour we explain that selective education is divisive and to the Tories we explain that it is expensive." [...] but Sir Humphrey then goes on to tell Hacker neither of these things, forgoing any suggestion that Hacker is from either party. Throughout the show, Hacker's political opinions tend towards reform of administration and are neither left nor right wing. However, the concentration on [...] "making budget cuts (of 5%)" [...] in the Yes Minister episode [...] "Doing the Honours" [...] and cutting taxes in the Yes Prime Minister episode [...] "The Smoke Screen" [...] allude towards him being a conservative; and the writers have since established that they privately saw Hacker as a centrist [...] "wet" [...] Conservative.|$|E

40|$|Stories {{of twins}} are told with {{astonishing}} frequency in contemporary culture. Films and novels from recent decades repeatedly tell of the stranglehold of brotherly love, the evil twin who steals her sister's lover, the homicidal mutant twin on a rampage, the reunion of twins separated at birth, twins divided by national borders, and confusion between look-alike twins. Critics {{tend to view}} twin tales as {{a subset of the}} literature of the double, in decline since the nineteenth century. A closer look at recent examples, however, reveals patterns of genre and gender quite specific to our time. Why do <b>we</b> keep <b>telling</b> twin tales?

60|$|These questions--be they {{right or}} wrong--educated {{men and women}} of all classes and denominations--orthodox, be it remembered, as well as unorthodox--are asking, and will ask more and more, till they receive an answer.

60|$|So it is {{with these}} poor European peoples. They pass me in the street.

There is nothing about me to tell them that I know what is good for them better than they do themselves. In the fairy tales the wise man wore a conical hat and a long robe with twiddly things all round the edge. You knew he was a clever man. It avoided the {{necessity}} of explanation.

We must try to make all which <b>we</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> bear on the great purpose of unfolding to woman her own calling in all ages--her especial calling in this one. We must incite them to realise the chivalrous belief of our old forefathers among their Saxon forests, that something Divine dwelt in the counsels of woman; but, on the other hand, we must continually remind them that they will attain that divine instinct, not by renouncing their sex, but by fulfilling it; by becoming true women, and not bad imitations of men; by educating their heads for the sake of their hearts, not their hearts for the sake of their heads; by claiming woman's divine vocation, as the priestess of purity, of beauty, and of love; by educating themselves to become, with God's blessing, worthy wives and mothers of a mighty nation of workers, in an age when the voice of the ever-working God is proclaiming through the thunder of falling dynasties, and crumbling idols: [...] "He that will not work, neither shall he eat." ...|$|E
6000|$|These falsehoods {{have worked}} out their own punishment.

They are reading the old legends, and when we call them superstitious--they grant it, and then produce passages in which the highest doctrines of Christianity are embodied in the most pathetic and noble stories. They are looking for themselves at the ante-Raphaellic artists, and when <b>we</b> <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> that Fra Angelico's pictures are weak, affected, ill-drawn, ill-coloured--they grant it, and then ask us if we can deny the sweetness, the purity, the rapt devotion, the saintly virtue, which shines forth from his faces. They ask us how beautiful and holy words or figures can be inspired by an evil spirit. They ask us why they are to deny the excellence of tales and pictures which make men more pure and humble, more earnest and noble. They tell us truly that all beauty is God's stamp, and that all beauty ought to be consecrated to his service. And then they ask us: [...] "If Protestantism denies that she can consecrate the beautiful, how can you wonder if we love the Romanism which can?
