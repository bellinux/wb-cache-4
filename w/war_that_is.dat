Kassandra recounts her life experiences at Troy and Colchis, how she came to balk at the gender roles dictated by Trojan culture, and her inner turmoil over whether she should be serving the Goddess or Apollo.|$|E

5|$|The {{contributors}} to Seara and Libertatea were, in general, outspoken {{social and cultural}} critics, with diverse grievances against the establishment. Historian Lucian Boia argues that, even though Bogdan-Pitești was on the German payroll, his switch from the Francophiles {{could have been a}} genuine form of conservatism. Boia thus notes that Seara was supportive of the Central Powers from the 1914 build-up to the <b>war,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> even before Cantacuzino had come to decide which side he liked best. The core group of Seara men included socialists of various hues: Arghezi, who claimed that Serbian nationalism was the spark of the war; Felix Aderca, who depicted the German Empire as the more progressive belligerent; and Rodion, who rendered the complains of Germanophile intellectuals from Moldavia. Others were left-wing refugees from the Russian Empire, who wanted Romania to join the Central Powers and help liberate Bessarabia: Alexis Nour, from the Poporanist faction, and the old anarchist Zamfir Arbore. Seara was also a platform for some disgruntled Romanians from Transylvania region, a Romanian irredenta under Austro-Hungarian rule. They included a mainstream Conservative commentator, Ilie Bărbulescu, who advised Romanians to not to focus on Transylvania, and prioritized action against the Russians. Two distinct voices were those of poet Dumitru Karnabatt, who identified the Entente Powers with Pan-Slavism or British imperialism; and Ion Gorun, the Transylvanian writer and Habsburg loyalist. Beyond politics, Seara came out with news on culture, selected for publishing by Ion Vinea and poet Jacques G. Costin.|$|E

His innate decency makes him join in this dangerous rescue of members of a navy whom he passionately hates for having killed his father. He comes to see the terrified German survivors not {{as part of a}} vicious murder machine but as shivering, wounded individuals, some little older than him, caught in a <b>war</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not of their own making. The novel is premised around a view that The Kerlogue’s crew obeyed an unwritten code to save any lives they could. In risking their lives, they recognised the drowning Germans not are combatants, but as fellow sailors and honoured what sailors traditionally believe the initials SOS stand for: “Save our Souls”.|$|E

It held steady at close to 40% as late as fall 1941, then grew rapidly during the war.

500|$|To {{represent}} the prologue to the war, the obverse {{of the monument}} (the side facing North Terrace) features a relief of the Spirit of Duty appearing as a vision before the youth of South Australia, represented in the work by a sculptural group consisting of a girl, a student and a farmer abandoning the [...] "symbols of their craft". The three are depicted in normal dress, as they are not yet soldiers and are currently unprepared for the <b>war</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> to come, and they are facing away from the world as they look to the vision before them. In Bagot's original plan, submitted for the 1924 competition, {{there was to be}} but a single nude figure kneeling before the vision (for which Bagot posed while in Europe), but Laybourne-Smith's 1926 submission became grander in its scope. In addition, Bagot's original designs were naturalistic, with the Spirit of Duty depicted as a female figure, but under Hoff's direction the figure was changed to male, and the style of the reliefs was changed to Art Deco—a [...] "radically new" [...] art style for Australia at the time. Hoff, however, presented the sculptural group in the original naturalistic style, thus providing a [...] "bridge between the Renaissance-style architecture and the Art Deco of the reliefs".|$|E
500|$|The book, {{which was}} misleadingly labeled as the posthumous seventh volume of Russell's Studies in the Scriptures, was denounced by Rutherford's opponents, but became a best-seller and was {{translated}} into six languages and serialized in The Watch Tower.

2500|$|The {{traditional}} {{meaning of}} blitzkrieg {{is that of}} German tactical and operational methodology {{in the first half}} of the Second World <b>War,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> often hailed as a new method of warfare. The word, meaning [...] "lightning war", in its strategic sense describes a series of quick and decisive short battles to deliver a knockout blow to an enemy state before it could fully mobilize. Tactically, blitzkrieg is a coordinated military effort by tanks, motorized infantry, artillery and aircraft, to create an overwhelming local superiority in combat power, to defeat the opponent and break through its defences. Blitzkrieg as used by Germany had considerable psychological, or [...] "terror" [...] elements, such as the Jericho Trompete, a noise-making siren on the Junkers Ju 87 dive-bomber, to affect the morale of enemy forces. The devices were largely removed when the enemy became used to the noise after the Battle of France in 1940 and instead bombs sometimes had whistles attached. It is also common for historians and writers to include psychological warfare by using Fifth columnists to spread rumours and lies among the civilian population in the theatre of operations.|$|E
