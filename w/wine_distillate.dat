The most efficient solution {{for the evaluation of}} aged <b>wine</b> <b>distillates</b> estimations with emphasis on the properties of the aroma and the taste, when an appropriate mathematical model cannot be found, is to develop adequate and reliable expert systems based on fuzzy logic and neural networks. A fuzzy classifier and a neural network are proposed for the {{classification of}} <b>wine</b> <b>distillates</b> for each of two distinct features of the products namely the aroma and the taste. The fuzzy classifier is based on the fuzzy k-nn algorithm while the neural system is a feedforward sigmoidal multilayer network which is trained using the back-propagation method.

40|$|Aroma is a {{phenomenon}} that occurrs when food and live organism mutually react {{during the process of}} consumption. Many factors influence the making of aroma of wine distillates (e. g. cognac) during the technological process of distillation. It is extremely difficult to bring an objective judgement on the influence of individual factors since aroma is very subjective in its nature. The possibility of objective assessment of the influence of grape varieties on <b>wine</b> <b>distillate</b> was performed in this work using a computer in processing the results of cromatographic analyses of aroma substances. The given results were verified by sensor analyses. The achieved results have shown that mathematical model for calculating aroma chromatogram similarity can be successfully used for objective assessment of the influence of individual factors on aroma of wine distillates and that grape varieties have significant impact on aroma and the quality of wine distillates...|$|E
40|$|PhD {{dissertation}} thesis "Study of {{correlation of}} quality parameters of wines and wine distillates" {{was done at}} Department of Post-Harvest Technology of Horticultural Products, Faculty of Horticulture, Mendel University of Agriculture and Forestry in Brno during 2006 - 2012. Samples of wines and samples of distillates made from these wines were analysed using liquid-liquid extraction method (LLE) followed by gas chromatography analysis (GC). Potential characteristics [...] chemical markers were determined: trans-linalool oxide and cislinalool oxide which are typical for Muscat Ottonel and tetradecanote, ethyl 3 - methylpentanoate for Pinot Blanc. In wine distillates, ethyl 2 -methylbutanoate, ethyl 3 - methylpentanoate, 1, 1 -diethoxybutane, diethoxypentane were determined, however none of these substances were found in wines. These substances probably originate {{as a result of}} esterification process during ageing of wine distillates after distillation process. Differences in chemical composition of wine distillates made from red wine grape cultivars were analysed using main component method. Group of substances such as ethyl butanoate, hexanoate, octanoate, decanoate, dodecanoate and diethyl succinate can be considered as possible markers identifying wine distillates from red wine grape cultivars and white grape cultivars. Characteristic aroma of grape variety was recognisable in wine distillates from Muscat Ottonell and Blue Frankish varieties. Samples of wine and wine distillates were analysed using Solid-phase micro extraction (SPME-headspace) technique followed by Gas chromatography [...] mass spectrometry (GCMS). Negative correlation between 1 -hexanol content and intensity of aroma was discovered in wine distillates. Characteristic aroma of grape variety showed significantly in distillates from Pinot Gris (RS_ 2) and in distillates from red wine grape cultivars, particularly Saint Laurent (SV) and Pinot Noir. Based on analysis of samples of wine distillates from red wine grape cultivars, ten major terpentic aromatic substances were determined (o-cymen, limonen, cis-b-ocimen, cislinalool oxid, linalool, isoborneol, terpinen- 4 -ol, a-terpineol, trans-sabinyl acetate a transkalamenen). All these substances influence aroma of grape variety. Both centred log ratio transform (clr) and main component method were applied and similarity in aroma of wine distillates was found and it was discovered that aroma of <b>wine</b> <b>distillate</b> from varieties Merlot, Pinot Noir and similar ones are influenced by terpenoids cis-linalool oxid, linalool, 94 isoborneol, terpinen- 4 -ol a a-terpineol. On the other hand, aroma of wine distillates from varieties Blue Portugieser and Cabernet Sauvignon are influenced by o-cymen, limonen, trans-sabinyl acetate and trans-kalamenen. Analysis of terpentic content wine distillates was carried out using Solid-phase micro extraction (SPME-headspace) technique followed by Gas chromatography [...] mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Major terpentic substances identified are limonen, linalool, a-ylangen, b- bourbonen, g-kadinen, trans-nerolidol, 2, 3 -dihydrofarnesol and (2 -cis, 6 -trans) -farnesol. Verifiable differences were discovered between various distillates types. Predominantly mono-terpentic substances were identified in wine distillates; in grappa there were also identified sesquiterpenic substances which are characteristic for these types of distillates...|$|E

40|$|The {{distinctive}} {{flavor of}} wine, brandy, and other grape-derived alcoholic beverages {{is affected by}} many compounds, including esters produced during alcoholic fermentation. The characteristic fruity odors of the fermentation bouquet are primarily due to a mixture of hexyl acetate, ethyl caproate (apple-like aroma), iso-amyl acetate (banana-like aroma), ethyl caprylate (apple-like aroma), and 2 -phenylethyl acetate (fruity, flowery flavor with a honey note). The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the feasibility of improving the aroma of <b>wine</b> and <b>distillates</b> by overexpressing one of the endogenous yeast genes that controls acetate ester production during fermentation. The synthesis of acetate esters by the wine yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae during fermentation is ascribed to at least three acetyltransferase activities, namely, alcohol acetyltransferase (AAT), ethanol acetyltransferase, and iso-amyl AAT. To investigate the effect of increased AAT activity on the sensory quality of Chenin blanc <b>wines</b> and <b>distillates</b> from Colombar base wines, we have overexpressed the alcohol acetyltransferase gene (ATF 1) of S. cerevisiae. The ATF 1 gene, located on chromosome XV, was cloned from a widely used commercial wine yeast strain of S. cerevisiae, VIN 13, and placed under the control of the constitutive yeast phosphoglycerate kinase gene (PGK 1) promoter and terminator. Chromoblot analysis confirmed the integration of the modified copy of ATF 1 into the genome of three commercial wine yeast strains (VIN 7, VIN 13, and WE 228). Northern blot analysis indicated constitutive expression of ATF 1 at high levels in these yeast transformants. The levels of ethyl acetate, iso-amyl acetate, and 2 -phenylethyl acetate increased 3 - to 10 -fold, 3. 8 - to 12 -fold, and 2 - to 10 -fold, respectively, depending on the fermentation temperature, cultivar, and yeast strain used. The concentrations of ethyl caprate, ethyl caprylate, and hexyl acetate only showed minor changes, whereas the acetic acid concentration decreased by more than half. These changes in the <b>wine</b> and <b>distillate</b> composition had a pronounced effect on the solvent or chemical aroma (associated with ethyl acetate and iso-amyl acetate) and the herbaceous and heads-associated aromas of the final distillate and the solvent or chemical and fruity or flowery characters of the Chenin blanc wines.

As part of an extensive taxonomic survey within the ecological framework of South African vineyards and wineries, {{and the influence of}} naturally occurring lactic acid bacteria on the quality of wine and brandy, a total of 54 strains were isolated from grape juice and at different stages of brandy base wine production. The strains were identified using numerical analysis of total soluble cell protein patterns, 16 S rRNA sequence analyses and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using species-specific primers. The predominant species was Oenococcus oeni (22 strains), but Lactobacillus brevis (8 strains), Lactobacillus paracasei (8 strains) and Lactobacillus plantarum (6 strains) were also isolated frequently. Many of the O. oeni strains were isolated from brandy base wines after completion of spontaneous malolactic fermentation (MLF). The Lactobacillus spp. were isolated from all the different stages of brandy base wine production. Lb. plantarum was the dominant species in the juice, but disappeared during the later stages of production. However, Lactobacillus hilgardii, Lb. brevis and Lb. paracasei were also isolated from base wine after spontaneous MLF. Strains identified as Lactobacillus vermiforme were isolated during the alcoholic fermentation and after MLF have been completed. Total soluble cell protein patterns grouped O. oeni strains into two phenotypic groups. Two phenotypic clusters have also been identified for the Lb. brevis isolates. The Lb. paracasei isolates all grouped in one cluster. This is the first report of the presence of Lb. paracasei and Lb. vermiforme in brandy base wines. The presence of the Lactobacillus spp. could be correlated to the decrease in quality of the base <b>wine</b> and <b>distillate,</b> while O. oeni strains were found to have a more favourable influence on the quality of base <b>wine</b> and <b>distillates.</b> These results shed some light on the ecology and oenological influence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on the quality of South African brandy. © 2003 Elsevier B.

40|$|Background and Aims The ageing process, in wooden barrels, is used {{to improve}} the sensory quality of <b>wines</b> and <b>distillates.</b> This process, however, is costly, often leading to an {{alternative}} strategy of using wood fragments. The main aim of this work was to evaluate the influence of size, toast level and origin of the oak fragments on the composition of grape marc distillates. Methods and Results The accelerated ageing process of grape marc distillate was optimised with a BoxBenhken experimental design. Five dependent variables were evaluated: the concentration of vanillin, whiskey lactone and phenolic substances, the antioxidant activity and the colour parameters to {{determine the influence of}} the independent variables: concentration of oak fragments, proportion of ethanol in Galician grape marc distillate (Orujo) and the time of maceration. The concentration of oak fragments was the variable with the greatest effect on the dependent variables evaluated, except for whiskey lactone. The optimal conditions obtained were applied in 11 experimental accelerated ageing processes to study the influence of size, toast level and origin of the oak fragments on the parameters previously mentioned. Conclusions The best results were obtained with the smaller fragment size (granular) from Quercus petraea with medium toast level. The contact time did not significantly influence the parameters evaluated. Significance of the Study This study, performed at a micro-scale, determined the optimum conditions for greater extraction of compounds from oak with beneficial characteristics: volatile compounds with positive notes, vanillin and whiskey lactone, and the phenolic substances with antioxidant properties. This option allows producers to reduce considerably the cost of the process.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} studies of {{microbiological}} and biochemical properties of masau (Ziziphus mauritiana) fruit fermentation {{and the development}} of starter cultures for the production of masau beverages. A survey to document the traditional processing techniques was conducted using a questionnaire and focus group discussions {{in each of the three}} districts, i. e., Mudzi, Mt Darwin and Muzarabani in Zimbabwe. The survey results showed that the masau fruit is usually gathered by women and children, and eaten raw or processed into products such as porridge, traditional cakes, mahewu (non-alcoholic fermented beverage), jam, which are sold at local markets. It is also naturally fermented under uncontrolled conditions and distilled into kachasu. The nutritional composition of the masau fruit was analysed. The fruits are good sources of nutrients such as carbohydrates, protein, and essential micronutrients such as calcium, potassium, phosphorus, copper, iron, zinc and vitamin C. In order to enable the selection of starter cultures for the production of masau <b>wine</b> and <b>distillate,</b> yeasts, yeast-like fungi, and lactic acid bacteria present on the unripe, ripe and dried fruits, and in the fermented masau fruits were isolated and identified using physiological and molecular methods. The predominant species were identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia kudriavzevii, P. fabianii, Aureobasidium pullulans, Lactobacillus agilisand L. plantarum. The yeast species were then characterised with respect to ethanol and flavour compounds production. Significant differences in the production of ethanol and other volatile compounds were observed during fermentation of masau juice among and within the tested Saccharomyces, Pichia and Saccharomycopsis species. Alcohols and esters were the major volatiles detected in the fermented juice. Ethyl hexanoate and ethyl octanoate were produced in highest amounts as compared to the other flavour compounds. Two traditional low-tech methods for preserving starter cultures, i. e., stabilisation of yeast cultures in dried plant fibre strands, and in rice cakes, were compared with standard lyophilisation. Viable cell counts made during six months storage at 4 °C and 25 °C of lyophilised yeasts, and yeast cultures preserved in dry rice cakes and dry plant fibre strands showed that the rice cake method performed significantly better than lyophilisation. The developed library of fermentation characteristics of yeasts can help in the design of mixtures of strains to obtain a specific melange of masau product functionalities. The defined starter cultures could be preserved using the traditional approaches, which are suitable for small-scale, low-tech applications...|$|R

Some of these esters and higher alcohols are important for the fruity flavors and therefore the final quality of wine and other fermented beverages. Esters are produced and hydrolyzed by alcohol acetyltransferases and esterases, respectively. In yeast, ester-synthesizing activities are represented by two alcohol acetyltransferases encoded by the ATFI and ATF 2 genes, and by an ethanol hexanoyl transferase encoded by the EHTI gene. Atfl p and Atf 2 p appear responsible for the production of ethyl acetate and isoamyl acetate, while Ehtl p synthesizes ethyl hexanoate from ethanol and hexanoyl-CoA. Although a fair amount of information is available regarding the ATF 1 gene, limited information is available on the remaining alcohol acetyltransferases. Only two genes that code for esterases have been identified in yeast, namely lAHI and TIPI. It has also been shown that the balance between alcohol acetyltransferases and esterases is important for the net rate of ester accumulation. Higher alcohols are synthesized from the a-keto-acids in the branched-chain amino acid metabolic pathway by decarboxylation and reduction. The transamination of the amino acid to the respective a-keto-acid is catalyzed by mitochondrial and cytosolic branched-chain amino acid transferases, which are encoded by the BATI and BAT 2 genes, respectively. In recent years, a strong scientific and industrial interest in the metabolism of flavoractive compounds has emerged, but information regarding the roles of specific enzymes and the physiological relevance of their metabolism remains limited. The aim of this project was to investigate the physiological and metabolic consequences of changes in the expression levels of some of the key enzymes involved in aroma compound production. The consequences of these changes on the chemical composition and the fermentation bouquet of <b>wines</b> and <b>distillates</b> were also investigated. The first part of the section on the results in this dissertation reports on the role and relative importance of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae enzymes involved in ester metabolism, namely Atflp, Atf 2 p, Ehtlp, Iahlp and Tiplp. The corresponding genes were overexpressed in a laboratory strain of S. cerevisiae, BY 4742, and in a widely used commercial wine yeast strain, VIN 13. Table wine and base wines for distillation were prepared with these VIN 13 transformed strains. The ester concentrations and aroma profiles of the <b>wines</b> and <b>distillates</b> were analyzed and compared. The data indicated that the overexpression of ATF 1 and ATF 2 increased the concentrations of ethyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, 2 -pheylethyl acetate and ethyl caproate, while the overexpression of JAHI resulted in a significant decrease in the concentrations of ethyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, hexyl acetate and 2 -phenylethyl acetate. The overexpression of EHTI resulted in a marked increase in the concentrations of ethyl caproate, ethyl caprylate and ethyl caprate, while the overexpression of TJP 1 did not decrease the concentrations of any of the esters. In most cases, there was a correlation between the increase in esters and the decrease in higher alcohols. The data suggest that yeast balances the amount of different esters produced through alcohol acetyltransferases and esterases, and that, in some cases, these enzymes appear to overlap in function and/or influence each other's activity. In {{the second part of the}} results section, the consequences of the deletion and the overexpression of two genes, BATl and BAT 2, which encode transaminases that contribute to the metabolism of higher alcohols, were investigated. The genes were both disrupted in a S. cerevisiae BY 4742, and overexpressed in both this laboratory strain and in the VIN 13 wine yeast strain. The effects of these modifications on the general physiology of the corresponding yeast strains and on higher alcohol metabolism were assessed in a range of growth conditions, including aerobic and anaerobic growth conditions, in the presence of glucose or raffinose as sole carbon source and growth in the presence of various concentrations of amino acids. Table wine and base wines for distillation were prepared with the modified industrial strains and the concentrations of the higher alcohols and the aroma profiles of the <b>wine</b> and <b>distillates</b> were analyzed and compared. Batl deletion seemed to be lethal under the conditions that were created, and therefore only the bat 2 !:!. strain, together with the BATI and BAT 2 overexpression strains, were investigated. These modifications did not appear to significantly affect the general physiology of the strains. The results obtained indicated that the overexpression of BATI increased the concentrations of isoamyl alcohol and isoamyl acetate, and, to a lesser extent, the concentrations of isobutanol and isobutyric acid. The overexpression of the BAT 2 gene resulted in a substantial increase in the levels of isobutanol, isobutyric acid and propionic acid production, and a modest increase in the level of propanol and isovaleric acid. Interestingly, the overexpression of BAT 2 led to a decrease in isoamyl alcohol and isoamyl acetate concentrations. Sensory analyses indicated that the <b>wines</b> and <b>distillates</b> produced with the strains in which the BATl and BAT 2 genes were overexpressed had more fruity characteristics (peach and apricot aromas) than the wines produced by the wild-type strains. This study offers new prospects for the development of wine yeast starter strains with optimized ester and higher alcohol-producing capability that could assist winemakers in their efforts to consistently produce wine to definable specifications and styles and a predetermined flavor profile. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Gedurende fermentasie produseer giste 'n wye verskeidenheid vlugtige aromatiese esters en hoër alkohole. Sommige van hierdie esters en hoër alkohole is belangrik vir die vrugtige geure en dra dus by tot die finale kwaliteit van wyn en ander gefermenteerde drankies. Esters word onderskeidelik deur alkoholasetieltranferases en esterases geproduseer en gehidroliseer. In giste word die ester-sintetiserende aktiwiteite deur twee alkoholasetieltransferases verteenwoordig wat deur die ATFI-en ATF 2 -gene, asook 'n etanolheksanoïeltransferase wat deur die EHTl-geen, gekodeer word. Dit blyk dat ATFlp en ATF 2 p verantwoordelik is vir die produksie van etielasetaat en isoamielasetaat, terwyl Ehtl p-etielheksanoaat vanaf etanol en heksanoïel-CoA sintetiseer. Alhoewel daar 'n redelike hoeveelheid inligting t. o. v die ATF I-geen beskikbaar is, is daar weinig inligting oor die res van die aloholasetieltransferases. Slegs twee gene wat vir esterases kodeer, is in gis geïdentifiseer, naamlik IAHI en TIPI. Daar is ook bewys dat 'n balans tussen die alkoholasetieltransferases en esterases baie belangrik is vir die netto-tempo van ester-akkumulasie. Hoër alkohole word gesintetiseer vanaf a-keto sure in die vertakte-ketting aminosuur metaboliese pad deur dekarboksilasie en reduksie. Die transaminasie van die aminosuur na die onderkeidelike a-ketosuur word deur vertakte-ketting aminosuur transferases, geleë in die mitochondrion en sitosol, en gekodeer deur BATl- en BAT 2 -gene, gekataliseer. In die laaste paar jare het daar 'n sterk wetenskaplike, asook industrïele, belangstelling in die metabolisme van aroma-aktiewe komponente te voorskyn gekom, maar inligting in verband met die rol van spesifieke ensieme en die fisiologiese belangrikheid van hul metabolisme is egter beperk. Die doel van hierdie projek was om die fisiologiese en metaboliese gevolge van veranderinge in die ekspressievlakke van sommige sleutelensieme betrokke by aromakomponent-produksie te ondersoek. Die gevolge van hierdie veranderinge op chemiese vlakke, asook hoe die fermentasie-aroma van die wyne en distillate beïnvloed word, is ook bestudeer. Die eerste gedeelte van die resultate rapporteer oor die rol en relatiewe belangrikheid van die Saccharomyces cerevisiae-ensieme betrokke by estermetabolisme, naamlik Atfl p, Atf 2 p, Ehtlp, Iahlp en Tiplp. Die gene was ooruitgedruk in 'n laboratoriurnras van S. cerevisiae, BY 4742, asook in 'n kommersïele wyngisras, VIN 13. Tafelwyne en basiswyne vir distillasie is gemaak met die getransformeerde VIN 13 -rasse. Die esterkonsentrasies en aromaprofiele van die wyne en distillate is ontleed en vergelyk. Die data het gewys dat die ooruitdrukking van ATFI- en ATF 2 -gene 'n verhoging in etielasetaat, isoamielasetaat, 2 -fenieletielasetaat en etielkaproaat veroorsaak het, terwyl ooruitdrukking van !AHI 'n betekenisvolle afname in etielasetaat-, isoamielasetaat-, heksielasetaat- en 2 -fenieletielasetaat-konsentrasies veroorsaak het. Die ooruitdrukking van EHTI het 'n duidelike verhoging in etielkaproaat, etielkaprilaat en etielkapraat veroorsaak en die ooruitdrukking van TIPIhet geen van die esterkonsentrasies verander nie. In die meeste gevalle was daar nie 'n korrelasie tussen die toename in esters en afname in hoër alkohole nie. Die data stelook voor dat die gis 'n balans tussen die verskillende esters handhaaf deur middel van die alkoholasetieltrasferases en esterases, en in sommige gevalle blyk dit dat die ensieme dieselfde funksies het en/of mekaar se aktiwiteit beïnvloed. In die tweede gedeelte van die resultate is die oorsake van delesie en ooruitdrukking van twee gene, BAT 1 en BAT 2, wat kodeer vir transaminases wat tot hoër alkohol metabolisme bydra, bestudeer. Die gene is uitgeslaan in S. cerevisiae BY 4742 en ooruitgedruk in BY 4742 en in die wyngisras VIN 13. Die effekte van hierdie modifikasies op die algemene fisiologie van die verskillende gisrasse en op hoëralkoholmetabolisme is onder 'n verskeidenheid kondisies bestudeer, naamlik aërobies en anaërobiese groeikondisies, in die teenwoordigheid van glukose of raffinose as die enigste koolstofbron, asook in die teenwoordigheid van 'n verskeidenheid konsentrasies aminosure. Tafelwyne en basiswyne vir distillasie is gemaak met die gemodifiseerde industrïele rasse en die konsentrasies van die hoër alkohole en aromaprofiele van die wyne en distillate is ontleed en vergelyk. Bat 1 -delesie was dodelik onder die kondisies, daarom is slegs die batlts-tes tesame met die BAT 1 en BAT 2 wat in die rasse ooruitgedruk is, bestudeer. Die modifikasies het nie 'n beduidende effek op die algemene fisiologie van die rasse getoon nie. Die data het wel getoon dat die ooruitdrukking van BAT 1 'n verhoging in isoamielalkohol- en isoamielasetaatkonsentrasies, en tot 'n mindere mate isobutielalkohol- en isobottersuur-konsentrasies, veroorsaak het. Die ooruitdrukking van BAT 2 het 'n beduidende toename in isobutanol-, isobottersuur- en propioonsuurkonsentrasies en 'n kleinere toename in propanol- en isovaleriaansuur veroorsaak. Die ooruitdrukking van BAT 2 het ook gelei tot 'n afname in isoamielalkohol- en isoamielasetaatkonsentrasies. Sensoriese analises het getoon dat die wyne en distillate wat geproduseer is met die rasse waarin die BAT 1 en BAT 2 gene ooruitgedruk is meer vrugtige eienskappe (perske- en appelkoos-aromas) getoon het as die wyne wat deur die wildetipe rasse geproduseer is. Die studie lewer nuwe vooruitsigte vir die ontwikkeling van wyngiste met geoptimiseerde ester en hoër alkohol produserende eienskappe wat die wynmakers in staat kan stelom wyne te produseer met gedefinieerde spesifikasies en style en 'n voorafbepaalde aromaprofiel...|$|R

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Brandy {{production}} is a multi-step process that involves grape harvesting, base wine fermentation, distillation, wood maturation and blending. Within {{each of these}} production process steps {{there are a number}} of factors that can influence the composition and resultant quality of the base wine, unaged and wood matured distillates. These factors include geographic and climatic features of the origin of grapes used, viticultural practices, grape maturity, grape variety, vintage variation, vinification techniques, storage of the base wine prior to distillation, distillation technique, age and origin of oak wood used for maturation and barrel toasting levels. The composition of flavour is extremely complex in wine and distilled beverages such as brandy. A multitude of compounds can take part in the formation of flavour, and it is rare that a particular compound, that is solely responsible for nuances of a specific flavour, is identified. Thus, taking brandy production factors and the nature of aroma and flavour into account, it is clear that thorough understanding of the complexities affecting the perception of quality in brandy is difficult. In commercial brandy production, standard operating procedures do not allow for the separate distillation of brandy base wines from different producers and mixing of base wines from different regions and producers thus occurs. This makes it difficult to determine whether the quality determination of the base wine is in fact an indication of the quality of the resultant distillate after the required period of wood maturation. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine whether there is any merit in storing and distilling brandy base wines from different producers and regions separately. This was done by firstly determining the demographic and production factors that influence brandy base wine composition. Secondly, the influence of brandy base wine composition on the quality of the respective unaged potstill distillates as well as the ultimate style and quality of the threeyear old wood matured potstill distillates was determined. For this purpose, four potstills with a capacity of 2000 L each were isolated and used for commercial scale distillations of 33 and 25 brandy base wines in 1999 and 2000, respectively, at the DisteIl distillery in Worcester. The experimental outlay used in the study closely emulated Distell's standard operating procedures for commercial brandy production. Chenin blanc and Colombar are the two most popular grape varietals used in the making of brandy base wine in South Africa. Due to the complexity of the brandy production process, the first part of the study only focussed on South African young Chenin blanc wines, with a predominantly fermentation derived aroma. The concentration of iso-amyl acetate, hexyl acetate, ethyl caprylate, ethyl caprate, 2 -phenethyl acetate and octanoic acid was significantly higher in wines awarded gold and silver medals and decreased significantly with subsequent decreases in quality categories. Ethyl lactate exhibited the opposite pattern. A quality predictor model based on the behaviour of 21 volatile compounds quantified in these wines had a resonable prediction accuracy when having to predict the quality of wines made in the same vintages as it had been trained on. It was significantly poorer when tested on a completely different vintage of wines to the ones it had been trained on. The number of vintages, number of wines per vintage and the number of compounds quantified for the model influence its prediction accuracy. Twenty-seven volatile compounds were quantified in 33 and 25 brandy base wines, their unaged and three year old distillates from 1999 and 2000, respectively. ANOVA and CART analysis showed that vintage, region, harvest time, choice of cultivar and yeast strain can have a significant influence on the volatile compound composition of brandy base wines, their unaged and three year old distillates. These factors as well as the volatile compound composition were also found to influence the sensory quality of these products. Base wines, unaged and three year old distillates originating from the De Dooms region, which predominantly cultivates table grapes, were of significantly lower quality than those from the remaining regions. Products made from grapes harvested early in the season were of significantly higher quality. The volatile aroma compound composition was found to differ significantly between the 1999 and 2000 base <b>wines</b> and <b>distillates,</b> irrespective of the exclusion of those samples that had undergone partial or complete malolactic fermentation. Consequently, quality indicating compounds may vary from vintage to vintage. The relationship between the quality of brandy base wines and the concentration of n-butanol, iso-amyl acetate, ethyl lactate, ethyl caprylate, octanoic- and decanoic acid was the same as that reported in young Chen in blanc wines in this study. In unaged distillates, increased levels of ethyl lactate also exert a negative influence on distillate quality. Iso-amyl acetate, hexyl acetate, ethyl caproate, ethyl caprylate, n-butanol, octanoic acid, ethyl caprate and decanoic acid showed some positive correlation, whilst iso-butanol, ethyl lactate, acetic acid, acetaldehyde and ethyl acetate showed a significant negative correlation to three-year old distillate quality. Sensory descriptive analysis on selected good, average and poor quality distillates using the South African brandy aroma wheel showed that there are small differences in profile between the good and average distillates, there were however significant differences between the good and poor quality distillate profiles throughout maturation. After three years of wood maturation, the aroma profile of poor quality distillates can be characterised by prominent herbaceous and woody aromas, which are more intense than the fruity aromas. Good quality distillates contained characteristically intense fruity aromas. Volatile compound concentration differences were noted during the course of and after three years of wood maturation and in barrels of varying ages. Distillates matured in new block barrels exhibited significant differences in volatile and wood compound composition after three years when compared to remaining barrels used. The style classification of the three-year old potstill distillate was influenced by demographic and production factors and volatile compound composition, but not by the sensory quality of the distillates. In summary, vintage, region, cultivar, harvest time and choice of yeast strain have a significant influence on the volatile composition of brandy base wines, their unaged and three year old potstill distillates, which in turn affects the sensory quality of these products. These effects cannot be viewed in isolation as they jointly exert an influence on the composition and quality of these products. From a commercial perspective, this study has provided a valuable indication as to which production and demographic factors can influence the quality and style of potstill brandy. Thus, future brandy base wine intake should, as far as possible, take place in such a manner to allow base wines originating from the same cultivar or region or harvest time or combination thereof (and to a lesser extent yeast strain) to be received simultaneously at the distillery for distillation. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Brandewyn produksie is 'n veelvoudige proses wat die volgende insluit: pars van druiwe, basiswyn fermentasie, verstoking, houtveroudering en versnyding. Binne hierdie stappe is verskeie faktore wat 'n invloed op die samestelling en resultate van die basiswyn, onverouderde en verouderde distillaat kan hê. Hierdie faktore sluit die volgende in: geografiese ligging, klimaat toestande van die streek van herkoms, wingerdboupraktyke, graad van rypheid, druifvarieteit, wynoes variasie, wynbou tegnieke, opberging van basiswyn voor distillasie, distillasie tegnieke, ouderdom en oorsprong van akkerhout vir die veroudering, asook tot watter mate die vat gerooster is. Die samestelling van geur in wyn en gedistilleerde produkte soos brandewyn is uiters kompleks. 'n Menigte samestellings kan deel vorm van die inhoud van die geur, en dit is raar dat 'n bepaalde verbinding alleenlik verantwoordelik is vir 'n kenmerkende geur. Weens die verskeidenheid van produksie faktore, aroma en smaak is volledige kennis van brandewyn ingewikkeld en kompliseerd om te verstaan. In kommersiële brandewynproduksie, maak standaard werksprosedures nie voorsiening vir aparte distillasie van basiswyn van verskillende produsente nie, en die vermenging van basiswyn van verskillende streke en produsente kom voor. Dit maak dit moeilik om te bepaal of die kwaliteit van die basiswyn of die distillaat na die neergelegde periode van houtveroudering, in werklikheid 'n beslissende indikasie op die kwaliteit van die verouderde produk is. Daarom is een van die doele van hierdie studie om te bepaal of daar meriete in is om brandewyn basiswyn van die verskillende produsente en streke apart te berg en te verstook. Dit is gedoen deur eerstens, die effek van demografiese en produksie faktore op die samestelling van brandewyn basiswyn te bepaal. Daarna, om die invloed van brandewyn basiswynsamestelling op die kwaliteit van onderskeidelik die onverouderde distillate sowel as die uiteindelike styl en kwaliteit van die 3 jaar oue houtverouderde potketel distillate, te bepaal. Vir hierdie doel, is vier potketels met 'n kapasiteit van 2000 liters elk geïsoleer en vir kommersiële skaal distillasies van 33 en 25 brandewyn basiswyne in 1999 en 2000, ondeskeidelik, by DisteIl Distillerdery, Worcester verstook. Die eksperimentele uitleg wat in hierdie studie gebruik is, ewenaar DisteIl se standaard verstokingsprosedures vir kommersiële brandewynproduksie. Chenin blanc en Colombar is die twee mees|$|R
