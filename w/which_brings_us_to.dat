2500|$|In A.D.1894, Sri Yukteswar {{wrote the}} book Kaivalya Darsanam, popularly known as The Holy Science, {{presenting}} a very convincing calculations of the Yugas. According to Sri Yukteswar, Kali Yuga consists of 1200 years (in human terms), wherein 100 years of transition into the yuga takes place at either end with 1000 years of Kali in between. In The Holy Science, Sri Yukteswar states, [...] "The astronomers and astrologers who calculate the almanacs have been guided by wrong annotations of certain Sanskrit scholars (such as Kulluka Bhatta) of the dark age of Kali Yuga, and now maintain that the length of Kali Yuga is 432,000 years of which 4994 have (in A.D. 1894) passed away, leaving 427,006 years still remaining. A dark prospect! and fortunately one not true." [...] Due to the misinterpretation, the scholars decided that Daiva Yuga (or Divine Years) were not human but heavenly years, thereby leading to a wrong conclusion. The descending Kali Yuga ended in A.D. 499, the period around which marked the most chaotic and ignorant one in human history. As per Sri Yukteswar, mankind is in the ascending arc of the Daiva Yugas, and at present in Dwapara Yuga, with the ascending Kali Yuga having ended properly in A.D. 1699. He states, [...] "From A.D. 499 onward, the sun began to advance toward the grand centre, and the intellect of man started to gradually develop. During the 1100 years of the Ascending Kali Yuga, <b>which</b> <b>brings</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> A.D. 1599, the human intellect was so dense {{that it could not}} comprehend the electricities, Sukshmabhuta, the fine matters of creation.". A.D. 1700 to A.D. 1900 were a 200 year transition period toward Dwapara Yuga, which began properly in A.D. 1900.|$|E

I do not except from this observation those who are willing, more than I find myself disposed, to submit to this fraternity. Never has it been mentioned in my hearing, or from what I can learn in my inquiry, without the suggestion of an Alien Bill, or some other measures of the same nature, as a defence against its manifest mischief. Who does not see the utter insufficiency of such a remedy, if such a remedy could be at all adopted? We expel suspected foreigners from hence; and we suffer every Englishman to pass over into France to be initiated in all the infernal discipline of the place, to cabal and to be corrupted by every means of cabal and of corruption, and then to return to England, charged with their worst dispositions and designs. In France {{he is out of}} the reach of your police; and when he returns to England, one such English emissary is worse than a legion of French, who are either tongue-tied, or whose speech betrays them. But the worst aliens are the ambassador and his train. These you cannot expel without a proof (always difficult) of direct practice against the state. A French ambassador, at the head of a French party, is an evil which we have never experienced. The mischief is by far more visible than the remedy. But, after all, every such measure as an Alien Bill is a measure of hostility, a preparation for it, or a cause of dispute that shall bring it on. In effect, it is fundamentally contrary to a relation of amity, whose essence is a perfectly free communication. Everything done to prevent it will provoke a foreign war. Everything, when we let it proceed, will produce domestic distraction. We shall be in a perpetual dilemma. But it is easy to see which side of the dilemma will be taken.

5000|$|In 1938 Cross {{attended}} classes {{given by}} Karl Knaths at the Phillips Gallery School of Art. These {{were the first}} of a series of annual classes he would give during the winter session of the school over the next decade. A painting of 1940 called [...] "Little Dove's Stove" [...] shows the influence of Knaths in its restricted palette; use of carefully positioned, bold, outlined shapes; and absence of three-dimensional illusion. It is nonetheless an entirely original work, the more so since Cross departed from convention by creating it on velvet rather than canvas or board. Although she did not continue to paint on velvet, Cross's work in the 1940s continued to show an adventurous experimentation with technique. This mainly manifested in an interest in surface texture. She would leave parts of a surface unpainted to show the bare canvas, use brush and knife to build up layers of pigment, and add mica or ordinary sand to her paintings. At the end of the decade a critic noted the appearance of dark works having a ghostly quality and a mannerist treatment of figures giving them an archaic simplicity. In 1949 this critic summarized the evolution of her painting over the prior 15 years: [...] "In her first exhibited paintings Bernice Cross developed a world of children and for children...
