The impossibility of relieving these stresses generates welding distortions that become a problem in dimensional setting of welded structures. This study aims to evaluate the influence of some parameters in the welding process in a T-type joint. Due {{to the complexity of}} the welded joint and the deposition rate, a three-dimensional finite element model was developed for the solution of the temperature field and distortions. The transient thermal analysis used the Goldak equation for definition of the heat flux transferred to the part. The nonlinear characteristics of the phenomenon as well as the dependence of physical and mechanical properties with the temperature were considered in this work. The parameters studied were the welding speed, <b>welding</b> <b>sequence</b> and cooling time between weld beads.

40|$|AbstractPreheating {{treatment}} and employing a proper <b>welding</b> <b>sequence</b> are introduced as two efficient approaches for reducing residual stresses in welding processes. Selecting a right <b>welding</b> <b>sequence</b> and a proper preheating temperature for a weld system are crucial tasks, since welding residual stresses are inevitably produced in a welded structure. However, obtaining residual stresses is very complex, and much time {{is needed in}} some cases, particularly for the modeling and prediction of residual stresses in welded structures. So in this work, we attempt to show that these stresses depend on generated entropy during the arc welding process. Thus by obtaining thermal irreversibility effects from temperature distribution, due to a variation of different welding parameters, selection of optimum factors to achieve minimum residual stress is not only possible, but easier to undertake. In the proposed method, {{it is not a}} necessity to obtain residual stress values, and one can predict the behavior of residual stress qualitatively. To do so, 3 D numerical models are employed to study the similar behavior of created residual stresses and entropy due to a variation of different preheating temperatures and three common welding sequences...|$|E
