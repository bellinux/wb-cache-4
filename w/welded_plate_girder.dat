40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present proper finite element (FE) models which can predict the dynamic characteristics and behaviour of a railway bridge under dynamic train loading for the purposes of fatigue design and assessment. As a case study, an existing six-span continuous <b>welded</b> <b>plate</b> <b>girder</b> railway bridge in Stockholm having the cross beams oriented at a skew angle of 80 ˚ with the main girder is investigated. The bridge was built in the mid 1950 s and its span vary between 26. 9 m and 33. 6 m in length. A number of detailed three-dimensional FE models of the bridge are developed in terms of increasing complexity, starting from a beam-only model and refining it to an FE model consisting of shell elements and the combination of the two. Additional factors that are being investigated are the effects of different boundary conditions, the number of modelled spans and the effect of secondary elements such as bracings. Eigenvalue analysis of the bridge is first carried out in order to determine its dynamic characteristics such as dominant frequencies and mode shapes. These are compared between the different models and the existing analytical solutions. Furthermore, available field measurements at different members on the bridge are compared with the results obtained from the FE analysis under the passage of a typical locomotive at various speeds. Based on the numerous FE analyses on the bridge models and their validation with the field measurements, few conclusions and suggestions are made for the advanced dynamic modelling of bridges...|$|E
40|$|Some of the Iowa Department of Transportation (Iowa DOT) continuous, steel, <b>welded</b> <b>plate</b> <b>girder</b> bridges have {{developed}} web cracking {{in the negative}} moment regions at the diaphragm connection plates. The cracks are due to out-of-plane bending of the web near the top flange of the girder. The out-of-plane bending occurs in the "web-gap", which is {{the portion of the}} girder web between (1) the top of the fillet welds attaching the diaphragm connection plate to the web and (2) the fillet welds attaching the flange to the web. A literature search indicated that four retrofit techniques have been suggested by other researchers to prevent or control this type of cracking. To eliminate the problem in new bridges, AASHTO specifications require a positive attachment between the connection plate and the top (tension) flange. Applying this requirement to existing bridges is expensive and difficult. The Iowa DOT has relied primarily on the hole-drilling technique to prevent crack extension once cracking has occurred; however, the literature indicates that hole-drilling alone may not be entirely effective in preventing crack extension. The objective of this research was to investigate experimentally a method proposed by the Iowa DOT to prevent cracking at the diaphragm/plate girder connection in steel bridges with X-type or K-type diaphragms. The method consists of loosening the bolts at some connections between the diaphragm diagonals and the connection plates. The investigation included selecting and testing five bridges: three with X-type diaphragms and two with K-type diaphragms. During 1996 and 1997, these bridges were instrumented using strain gages and displacement transducers to obtain the response at various locations before and after implementing the method. Bridges were subjected to loaded test trucks traveling in different lanes with speeds varying from crawl speed to 65 mph (104 km/h) to determine the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results of the study show that the effect of out-of-plane loading was confined to widths of approximately 4 in. (100 mm) {{on either side of the}} connection plates. Further, they demonstrate that the stresses in gaps with drilled holes were higher than those in gaps without cracks, implying that the drilling hole technique is not sufficient to prevent crack extension. The behavior of the web gaps in X-type diaphragm bridges was greatly enhanced by the proposed method as the stress range and out-of-plane distortion were reduced by at least 42 % at the exterior girders. For bridges with K-type diaphragms, a similar trend was obtained. However, the stress range increased in one of the web gaps after implementing the proposed method. Other design aspects (wind, stability of compression flange, and lateral distribution of loads) must be considered when deciding whether to adopt the proposed method. Considering the results of this investigation, the proposed method can be implemented for X-type diaphragm bridges. Further research is recommended for K-type diaphragm bridges...|$|E

The seriousness of the cracking and the corresponding potential risk on the integrity of the bridge superstructure were assessed. Inspection and repair guidelines for bridges with the welded diaphragm connections were also developed as part of the research effort. This volume presents the results of laboratory fatigue tests that were conducted to evaluate the cyclic life of staggered and non-staggered diaphragm connections. The performance of three different repair and retrofit procedures on the cyclic life of the welded diaphragm connection was also studied. Analytical models of the cracked diaphragm connection were developed to study the expected response under field loading conditions.

This volume presents the results of an evaluation of a brittle fracture crack that was discovered in one of the <b>welded</b> <b>plate</b> <b>girder</b> members of the I- 64 Blue River Bridge in Harrison County of southern Indiana. The crack, which nearly severed the exterior girder on the northern side of the east-bound structure, was located in the middle span of the three-span bridge structure. The crack extended for most of the plate girder depth before it was arrested in the compression region {{near the top of the}} girder and the concrete deck. The primary purpose of the research study was to examine the causes of the brittle fracture of the I- 64 Blue River Bridge girder.

40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical {{study of the}} shear response of lean duplex stainless steel <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> is described in this paper.

40|$|The {{theory on}} which this {{particular}} type of structure is based is given in the January issue of the "Journal of the Institute of Engineers" in a paper entitled "The design and construction of composite slab and girder bridges" and reference {{will be made to}} the subject matter of this paper. The paper can be regarded as part of this thesis. Experiments on test pieces designed to investigate the possibility of reinforcing a structure consisting of a concrete deck slab supported by steel joists for shear between the top of the steel section and the concrete, were first conducted and indicated that the theoretical expectations were realised in practice A 34 ft span two beam bridge with a 10 ft roadway was designed and constructed for testing the type of structure on a larger scale (Commonwealth Engineer, April 1933) Later a 1 / 6 scale model of one span of the proposed Leven bridge was also constructed for testing purposes, but rather {{from the point of view}} of load distribution between the beams than from strength considerations. Two, three, four and five beam highway bridges of this type have now been constructed and it is of interest to note that the structural and economic advantage to be gained is likely to lead to a very extensive use in the future of this class of construction. The subject matter of the thesis, outlines the principles of the design and construction of composite beam bridges in general, and describes the Leven Bridge, which is a four beam bridge of this type, having 7 spans each 61 feet long. The deck of the Leven bridge carries a roadway 20 ft between the kerbs, with a 4 ft footway on each side. Reference is made, in describing the work, to the Journal paper and to the working drawings for the bridge. The Leven River rises in the vicinity of Mt. Pearce about 35 miles from the coast, and flows into Bass Strait at Ulverstone on the North West Coast of Tasmania; the Coast Highway passes through the town less than a mile from the sea. The existing bridge is. a timber structure 49 years old, and is in such a state of decay that it was considered to have reached the end of its useful life. Consideration was therefore given to the renewal of the structure which is a vital link in the communication system in this part of the State. A survey, of the locality, was therefore made and consideration given to five sites on which the bridge could be renewed; these are shown on Drawing 65 L- 2. Eventually the site marked 1. B. was selected by the Parliamentary Committee investigating the proposals and a decision made to renew the bridge with a permanent structure at an estimated cost of 213, 700, exclusive of land resumption. Bore holes 66 feet apart were put down on the centre line of this site and indicated that a suitable foundation could not be obtained less than 35 feet below the river bed. A 10 ft rise and fall of tide had also to be reckoned with. A number of designs were examined for the superstructure, including a three span high through truss bridge, several arrangements of welded pony trusses, and several arrangements of welded plate girders, Of these proposals a 7 span cantilever <b>welded</b> <b>plate</b> <b>girder</b> bridge was recommended as most suitable; the above designs were all prepared for a 18 ft roadway and one 4 ft footway. Later, however, an examination of the composite slat and girder type showed a marked saving over the latter bridge, but as the necessary funds had already been voted by Parliament, it was decided to increase the roadway width to 20 feet, and add another footway, as it was estimated that the additional work could be undertaken for the difference in costs of the two types...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of virtual}} {{experiments}} of <b>welded</b> steel <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> are commonplace in modern structural research. One {{key factor in}} the success of using such numerical analysis is the availability and reliability of input data including imperfections such as initial deformations and residual stresses. In this research a methodology combining experimental and numerical work is developed in order to use virtually fabricated welded specimens, which include the imperfections {{as a result of the}} manufacturing process, in virtual experiments. A series of experiments are performed to calibrate and validate the numerical models. Temperature measurements are conducted in a steel structure factory during the <b>welding</b> of <b>plate</b> <b>girders.</b> The measurement methodology developed combines two types of measurements using an infrared thermometer without disturbing the fabrication process itself. The residual stresses are measured using a modified hole drilling method. Geometrical imperfection measurement results are also available from other related projects. For the numerical simulation of welding a mixed time integration scheme is proposed. For the modelling of the heat source of welding an “equivalent prismatic heat source model” is developed, which is very robust and allows for very simple calibration. Both thermal and thermal stress analyses of the welding process are performed including a large number of parametric studies. The residual stress measurements are also numerically investigated and calibration tables are developed to evaluate the measurements considering inaccuracies in their execution. The fabrication of full size <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> is simulated. The calculated and measured web deformations are compared and reasonable agreement is found. Finally, to demonstrate and summarise the achievements of this research, a virtual specimen is used in a virtual experiment in which the ultimate behaviour of a <b>plate</b> <b>girder</b> is studied...|$|R
40|$|The thesis gives {{details of}} a series of design {{investigations}} carried out on mild steel, <b>welded,</b> <b>plate</b> <b>girders,</b> having a constant I section and supported laterally and torsionally only at the ends of the span. The main aim is to establish a General Method for expediting the design calculations for obtaining the optimum cross sectional dimensions of such a girder, essentially in accordance with the regulations as laid down in the British Standard Specification (B. S. 449, while observing some rules for efficient or economical design. Here Minimum Weight Design has been chosen as the criterion of efficiency, though the methods devised can readily be extended or adapted to deal with other criteria. The moment of resistance, as reduced by lateral buckling, is deemed to be the significant factor in each design, though the various other effects are considered as well. A review of the problem is given, and an empirical investigation is then carried out to obtain the sectional dimensions of girders at Minimum Weight, spanning 100 feet, and resisting various moments. This work is then extended to a wider application by means of a theoretical analysis, and a General Method is obtained. Suggestions are made as to how this Method may be applied, viz: by the construction of charts and tables or by the writing of an all embracing computer programme to give automatic design. Various additional effects are described and finally an outline is given as to how this work can be extended to deal with more complicated practical girders...|$|R
40|$|<b>Welded</b> {{thin-walled}} <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> play {{an increasingly}} important role in steel structures. The provisions of modern codes with regard to design are restricted to the span region between supports. The design of the joint panel is still governed by the buckling load, thus making the application of costly stiffeners necessary. Experimental investigations on such joints have shown that their strength is well above this load, due {{to the development of}} a tension field action. To ensure an effective design, it is necessary to make allowance for the postbuckling reserve of strength and to identify possible collapse mechanisms. The present paper provides a method for calculating the carrying capacity and the deformation characteristics of the joints. Static and kinematic limit state models are presented which allow the ultimate strength to be determined from closed formulae. The predicted values are in reasonable agreement with experimental results. © 1993...|$|R

The aluminum alloy <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> were fabricated by <b>welding</b> three <b>plates</b> to form an I-section. A total of 118 numerical data are presented.

The welding of the aluminum alloy <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> and the influence of the heat affected zone (HAZ) are also considered and carefully modeled. A sensitivity analysis on geometric imperfections of the aluminum alloy <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> was performed. It was shown that the finite element model closely predicted the ultimate loads, web deformations and failure modes of aluminum alloy <b>plate</b> <b>girders.</b> Hence, the model was used for an extensive parametric study of cross-section geometries, and the web slenderness value ranged from 49 to 393. The test results and the shear resistances predicted by the finite element analysis were compared with the design strengths obtained using the European Code and American Specification for aluminum structures. Based on the experimental and numerical results, a design method for shear resistance of aluminum alloy <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> is proposed in this study.

Fabrication of the boom will be completed in two parts solely for ease of transportation. The end pivot connection will be made through a single 2 -inch diameter x 4 feet- 8 inch long 316 SS bar. During installation, hard piping make-ups using Chiksan joints will connect the annular section and 4 -inch return line to allow full movement of the mast from horizontal to vertical. Additionally, flexible hoses and piping will be installed to isolate both towers from piping loads and allow recycling operations respectively. Calibration of the prototype Foam Generator Cell has been completed and experiments are now being conducted. We were able to generate up to 95 % quality foam. Work is currently underway to attach the Thermo-Haake RS 300 viscometer and install a view port with a microscope to measure foam bubble size and bubble size distribution. Foam rheology tests (Task 13) were carried out to evaluate the rheological properties of the proposed foam formulation. After successful completion of the first foam test, two sets of rheological tests were conducted at different foam flow rates while keeping other parameters constant (100 psig, 70 F, 80 % quality). The results from these tests are generally {{in agreement with the}} previous foam tests done previously during Task 9. However, an unanticipated observation during these tests was that in both cases, the frictional pressure drop in 2 inch pipe was lower than that in the 3 inch and 4 inch pipes. We also conducted the first foam cuttings transport test during this quarter. Experiments on aerated fluids without cuttings have been completed in ACTF (Task 10). Gas and liquid were injected at different flow rates. Two different sets of experiments were carried out, where the only difference was the temperature. Another set of tests was performed, which covered a wide range of pressure and temperature. Several parameters were measured during these tests including differential pressure and mixture density in the annulus. Flow patterns during the aerated fluids test have been observed through the view port in the annulus and recorded by a video camera. Most of the flow patterns were slug flow. Further increase in gas flow rate changed the wavy flow pattern to slug flow. At this stage, all of the planned cuttings transport tests have been completed. The results clearly show that temperature significantly affects the cuttings transport efficiency of aerated muds, in addition to the liquid flow rate and gas liquid ratio (GLR). Since the printed circuit board is functioning (Task 11) with acceptable noise level we were able to conduct several tests. We used the newly designed pipe test section to conduct tests. We tested to verify that we can distinguish between different depths of sand in a static bed of sand in the pipe section. The results indicated that we can distinguish between different sand levels. We tested with water, air and a mix of the two mediums. Major modifications (installation of magnetic flow meter, pipe fittings and pipelines) to the dynamic bubble characterization facility (DTF, Task 12) were completed.

40|$|What differentiates a beam from a <b>plate</b> <b>girder?</b> This {{may seem}} to be a trivial question. However, it is a {{necessary}} and important part of <b>plate</b> <b>girder</b> design when applying the Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) Specification. 1 A beam can be a rolled or a welded shape, but it does not have intermediate stiffeners and its web width-thickness ratio hc/tw must not exceed yfF/ 970, where hc is twice the distance from the neutral axis to the compression flange (Fig. 1). <b>Plate</b> <b>girders</b> have stiffeners or hc/tw is greater than yfF/ 970, or both. Making this distinction and the compactness classification early in <b>plate</b> <b>girder</b> design is important when using the LRFD Specification. The significance of these items {{can be seen in the}} LRFD Manual flowcharts (Figs. 2 and 3) for the determination of flexural and shear design strength. With these flowcharts, this discussion will focus on the design of <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> according to LRFD rules. An explanation of <b>plate</b> <b>girder</b> design in the LRFD Specification will include: flexural design strength, shear design strength, flexure-shear interaction, bearing strength under concentrated loads and stiffener design. Application of the LRFD method will show there is actually little difference between it and Allowable Stress Design (ASD) 8 of <b>plate</b> <b>girders.</b> FLEXURAL STRENGTH The design flexural strength is calculated to provide an adequate section modulus. The first criterion necessary to separate a beam from a <b>plate</b> <b>girder,</b> yfF/ 970, relates to flexural design strength. Although there are preliminary steps, LRFD Specification Appendix G 2 * gives the flexural capacity for a <b>plate</b> <b>girder,</b> whereas Appendix F 1. 7 is applicable to beams. Entering the flowchart (Fig. 2) with a trial web and flange plate size, the initial step is to determine whether plastic or elastic design is appropriate. Plastic design is permitted if the section is compact and adequate bracing is provided in accordance with Sect. F 1. 1, such that "the laterally unbraced length Lb of the compression flange at plastic hinge locations associated with the failure mechanism " does not excee...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of the prestressing technique to steel structures {{makes it possible to}} increase the load-carrying capacity as well as to extend the elastic region of existing steel bridge systems. The aim of this particular research is not only to develop a method of nonlinear analysis of prestressed composite <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> based on the incremental deformation method, but also to demonstrate the feasibility of applying the prestressing technique to the strengthening of existing steel bridges. The accuracy of the proposed analysis was verified by comparisons with test results on full scale prestressed composite <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> with various levels of prestressing, eccentricity of draped tendons, and differing tendon material properties. Using this method it was possible to predict the ultimate response and failure modes of the various prestressed composite <b>plate</b> <b>girders.</b> The performance of different types of prestressed composite <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> under static loading was analytically evaluated for the strengthening of existing steel bridge systems. Furthermore, a method of performance evaluation related to the load-carrying capacity and deflection control of the prestressed composite <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> with external tendons is proposed, based on consideration of the analytical results, with some optimum geometric and material parameters. Finally, the design concept of prestressed composite <b>plate</b> <b>girders</b> with external tendons is discussed in relation to the construction of new bridges, and in the strengthening of existing bridges...|$|R
