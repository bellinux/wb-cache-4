25|$|Baroque era cellos {{differed}} from the modern instrument in several ways. The neck has a different form and angle, which matches the baroque bass-bar and stringing. Modern cellos have an endpin at the bottom to support the instrument (and transmit some of the sound through the floor), while Baroque cellos are held only by the calves of the player. Modern bows curve in and are held at the frog; Baroque bows curve out and are held closer to the bow's point of balance. Modern strings normally have a metal core, although some use a synthetic core; Baroque strings are made of gut, with the G and C strings <b>wire-wound.</b> Modern cellos often have fine-tuners connecting the strings to the tailpiece, which make {{it much easier to}} tune the instrument, but such pins are rendered ineffective by the flexibility of the gut strings used on Baroque cellos. Overall, the modern instrument has much higher string tension than the Baroque cello, resulting in a louder, more projecting tone, with fewer overtones.|$|E

2500|$|The {{invention}} of <b>wire-wound</b> strings (fine wire around a thin gut core), around 1660 in Bologna, {{allowed for a}} finer bass sound than was possible with purely gut strings on such a short body. Bolognese makers exploited this new technology to create the cello, a somewhat smaller instrument suitable for solo repertoire due to both the timbre of the instrument {{and the fact that}} the smaller size made it easier to play virtuosic passages [...] This instrument had disadvantages as well, however. The cello's light sound was not as suitable for church and ensemble playing, so it had to be doubled by organ, theorbo or violone.|$|E
2500|$|The {{thermal noise}} of a {{practical}} resistor {{may also be}} larger than the theoretical prediction and that increase is typically frequency-dependent. Excess noise of a practical resistor is observed only when current flows through it. This is specified in unit of μV/V/decade – μV of noise per volt applied across the resistor per decade of frequency. [...] The μV/V/decade value is frequently given in dB so that a resistor with a noise index of 0dB exhibits 1 μV (rms) of excess noise for each volt across the resistor in each frequency decade. [...] Excess noise is thus an example of 1/f noise. [...] Thick-film and carbon composition resistors generate more excess noise than other types at low frequencies. <b>Wire-wound</b> and thin-film resistors are often used for their better noise characteristics. [...] Carbon composition resistors can exhibit a noise index of 0dB while bulk metal foil resistors may have a noise index of −40dB, usually making the excess noise of metal foil resistors insignificant. Thin film surface mount resistors typically have lower noise and better thermal stability than thick film surface mount resistors. Excess noise is also size-dependent: in general excess noise is reduced as the physical size of a resistor is increased (or multiple resistors are used in parallel), as the independently fluctuating resistances of smaller components tend to average out.|$|E

50|$|The BL 4-inch gun Mark VIII was a British medium-velocity <b>wire-wound</b> naval gun {{introduced}} in 1908 as an anti-torpedo boat gun in smaller ships whose decks could {{not support the}} strain of the heavier and more powerful Mk VII gun.|$|E

To reduce friction between GuitarBot's <b>wire-wound</b> strings and the movable fret, flatwound strings are used.

50|$|The BL 12 inch naval gun Mark VIII {{was one of}} {{the first}} large British rifled breech-loading naval guns {{designed}} for the higher pressures generated by the new cordite propellant of the 1890s, and Britain's first large <b>wire-wound</b> gun.

50|$|There {{are three}} primary types of {{potential}} transformers (PT): electromagnetic, capacitor, and optical. The electromagnetic potential transformer is a <b>wire-wound</b> transformer. The {{capacitor voltage transformer}} (CVT) uses a capacitance potential divider and is used at higher voltages due to a lower cost than an electromagnetic PT. An optical voltage transformer exploits the Faraday effect, rotating polarized light, in optical materials.|$|E
50|$|Minco Products, Inc {{was founded}} by Karl Schurr on October 2, 1956, as an {{engineering}} firm, designing and building precision electromechanical devices on a subcontract basis. In 1958, the company decided {{to concentrate on the}} development of proprietary products. One of the first efforts was flexible <b>wire-wound</b> temperature sensors for aerospace guidance systems, which {{led to the development of}} flexible heaters, introduced by Minco in 1960.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} primary types of voltage {{transformers}} (VT): electromagnetic, capacitor, and optical. The electromagnetic voltage transformer is a <b>wire-wound</b> transformer. The {{capacitor voltage transformer}} uses a capacitance potential divider and is used at higher voltages due to a lower cost than an electromagnetic VT. An optical voltage transformer exploits the electrical properties of optical materials. Measurement of high voltages is possible by the potential transformers.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{while these}} systems can score well for PCOLA-SOQ for a resistor, some {{may not be}} able to {{differentiate}} whether the resistor is <b>wire-wound</b> or carbon composition. Neither will some be able to differentiate a ¼ watt resistor from a ½ watt rated resistor. Thus, the ‘Correct’ category will be “partially tested”, even though its resistance is measured. Grading of tests versus the defect universe should be done conservatively, and the criteria used should be transparent.|$|E
