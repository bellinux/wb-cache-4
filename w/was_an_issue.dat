5|$|During her {{subsequent}} {{testimony before}} the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee {{as part of the}} confirmation hearings, she refused to answer questions about her view on the constitutionality of some issues such as the death penalty as it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> that she might have to vote on if it came before the court.|$|E
5|$|Daley {{received}} criticism when family, personal friends, {{and political}} allies seemed to disproportionately benefit from city contracting. He {{took office in}} a city with regular annual budget surpluses and left the city with massive structural deficits. His budgets ran up the largest deficits in Chicago history. Prior to serving as mayor, Daley served in the Illinois Senate and then as the Cook County State's Attorney. Police use of force <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> in Daley's tenures as state's attorney and mayor.|$|E

5|$|Daley {{took control}} of the Chicago Public School system in 1995 and {{appointed}} Paul Vallas. When Vallas left the post to run for governor, Daley chose the relatively obscure Arne Duncan, who later became the U.S. Secretary of Education under Barack Obama, to lead the district. On March 19, 1997, the Chicago City Council adopted the Domestic Partners Ordinance, which made employee benefits available to same-sex partners of City employees. Daley said it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> of fairness.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} bill first passed the Commons, Baird {{acknowledged}} that the Conservatives might have unintentionally broken political financing laws by failing to report convention fees collected in 2005. He told a Senate committee that $1.7 million was left unreported {{and that he did}} not realize it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> at the time. The matter is under review by the Chief Electoral Officer. The Conservatives quietly tabled an amendment to the Accountability Act in November 2006, stipulating that convention fees will not be counted as political contributions.|$|E
5|$|Smuggling off American coasts <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> {{before the}} Revolutionary War, {{and after the}} Revolution it was more problematic. Along with smuggling, lack of {{shipping}} control, pirating, and a revenue unbalance were also major problems. In response, Hamilton proposed to Congress to enact a naval police force called revenue cutters in order to patrol the waters and assist the custom collectors with confiscating contraband. This idea was also proposed to assist in tariff controlling, boosting the American economy, and promote the merchant marine. It is thought that his experience obtained during his apprenticeship with Nicholas Kruger was influential in his decision-making.|$|E

5|$|The {{improvement}} in running {{time and the}} wide broadcast of the race results provided a public demonstration of how the blade length affects performance. Pistorius' stride length was actually 9 percent longer (2.2m vs 2.0m), but Oliveira took more strides (99 vs 92). The combination of stride length and stride rate led to a clearly unusual performance with the longer blades. Pistorius' management {{issued a statement saying}} that Pistorius is always 1.84 meters tall, regardless of what prostheses he wears, and that the decision to maintain this height for his running blades <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> of fairness.|$|E
5|$|The old bronze penny was {{slated for}} {{elimination}} as decimal currency was planned in the 1960s. It {{continued to be}} struck after 1967, still bearing that date. The 97 percent copper, 0.5 percent tin, 2.5 percent zinc alloy was used again for the 1960s pennies. Finally, there <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> of proof quality coins dated 1970 for collectors, to bid farewell to a denomination which had served the country well for 1200 years. The longstanding depiction of Britannia on the penny was translated by sculptor Christopher Ironside to the post-decimal fifty-pence coin.|$|E
5|$|After Edgehill, Rupert asked Charles for a swift cavalry {{attack on}} London before the Earl of Essex's army could return. The King's senior counsellors, however, {{urged him to}} advance slowly on the capital with the whole army. By the time they arrived, the city had {{organised}} defences against them. Some argue that, in delaying, the Royalists had perhaps lost their best chance of winning the war, although others have argued that Rupert's proposed attack would have had trouble penetrating a hostile London. Instead, early in 1643, Rupert began to clear the South-West, taking Cirencester in February before moving further against Bristol, a key port. Rupert took Bristol in July with his brother Maurice using Cornish forces and was appointed Governor of the city. By mid-1643 Rupert had become so well known that he <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> in any potential peace accommodation—Parliament was seeking to see him punished as part of any negotiated solution, {{and the presence of}} Rupert at the court, close to the King during the negotiations, was perceived as a bellicose statement in itself.|$|E

5|$|Following {{enquiries}} by the media, Paramount and Namco {{released a}} joint statement explaining that it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> with the Steam system, and was something {{that the company was}} seeking to fix shortly. While others stated issues with co-op gameplay on the PS3, the companies stated that they were not aware of any issues and recommended that faults should be reported via Twitter. After the PC issue was rectified, a further statement was published to alert customers that they could now use this type of gameplay. A day after the co-op issues with Star Trek were resolved, the Dead Island: Riptide problems were also corrected, with speculation by reviewers presuming that it was the same error in both games.|$|E
5|$|Glenn {{chaired the}} Committee on Governmental Affairs from 1987 to 1995. It {{was in this}} role that he {{discovered}} a host of safety and environmental problems with the nation's nuclear weapons facilities. Glenn was {{made aware of the}} problem at the Fernald Feed Materials Production Center near Cincinnati, and soon found that it <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> that occurred at several sites around the nation. Glenn requested investigations from the General Accounting Office of Congress and held several hearings on the issue. He spent the remainder of his Senate career acquiring funding to clean up the nuclear waste left at the facilities. He also sat on the Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees and the Special Committee on Aging.|$|E
5|$|There {{were over}} 1,000underground newspapers; {{among the most}} {{important}} were the Biuletyn Informacyjny of Armia Krajowa and Rzeczpospolita of the Government Delegation for Poland. In addition to publication of news (from intercepted Western radio transmissions), there were hundreds of underground publications dedicated to politics, economics, education, and literature (for example, Sztuka i Naród). The highest recorded publication volume <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> of Biuletyn Informacyjny printed in 43,000copies; average volume of larger publication was 1,000–5,000copies. The Polish underground also published booklets and leaflets from imaginary anti-Nazi German organizations aimed at spreading disinformation and lowering morale among the Germans. Books were also sometimes printed. Other items were also printed, such as patriotic posters or fake German administration posters, ordering the Germans to evacuate Poland or telling Poles to register household cats.|$|E
