5|$|After passing Carlyon Bay {{the path}} {{comes to the}} much busier china-clay {{exporting}} port of Par, where it goes inland of the dock site. After passing through the village the path regains the coast at Par Sands and links with the Saints' <b>Way,</b> <b>a</b> coast-to-coast path across Cornwall, at Polmear. It then follows the cliff tops through Polkerris and around Gribbin Head. From here to Polperro is designated as a heritage coast.|$|E
5|$|Because the Moon is {{continuously}} blocking {{our view}} of a half-degree-wide circular area of the sky, the related phenomenon of occultation occurs when a bright star or planet passes behind the Moon and is occulted: hidden from view. In this <b>way,</b> <b>a</b> solar eclipse is an occultation of the Sun. Because the Moon is comparatively close to Earth, occultations of individual stars are not visible everywhere on the planet, nor at the same time. Because of the precession of the lunar orbit, each year different stars are occulted.|$|E

It was based upon the religious teachings of Pythagoras and was very secretive. The adherents were bound by a vow to Pythagoras and each other, for the purpose of pursuing the religious and ascetic observances, and of studying his religious and philosophical theories. There is mentioning of an oath on the Tetractys.|$|R

5|$|Born into a well-read {{and educated}} family, Hambro {{developed}} {{a penchant for}} French literature, marking an incongruity to the literary taste of his parents—they had been readers of English literature in the Anglo-American tradition. Making his debut in 1960 with the satirical novel De frafalnes klubb, Hambro published trilogies and other novels {{for the next two}} decades. He had a keen interest in linguistics; in the 1969 book Ting, tanke, tale he problematized linguistic questions in a popular scientific <b>way.</b> <b>A</b> translator of French literature, he chaired the Norwegian Association of Literary Translators in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|By 2:00 AM {{the entire}} army was in motion roughly along Quaker Bridge Road through {{what is now}} Hamilton Township. The men were ordered to march with {{absolute}} silence.

The march was difficult, {{as some of the}} route ran through thick woods and it was icy, causing horses to slip, and men to break through ice on ponds.|$|E
5|$|By 3:30p.m. the {{massacre}} was well under <b>way.</b> <b>A</b> {{group of women}} in Rock Springs had gathered at the plank bridge, where they stood and cheered on the rampage. Two of the women reportedly fired shots at the Chinese. As the riot wore on into the night, the Chinese miners scattered into the hills, lying in the grass to hide. Between four and nine p.m., rioters {{set fire to the}} camp houses belonging to the coal company. By nine p.m., all but one Chinese camp house was burned completely. In all, 79 Chinese homes were destroyed by fire. Damage to Chinese-owned property was estimated at around $147,000.|$|E

He illustrates the <b>way</b> <b>a</b> splash breaks into droplets and compares {{this to the}} shapes of Campanularian zoophytes (Hydrozoa). He looks at the flask-like shapes of single-celled organisms such as species of Vorticella, considering teleological and physical explanations of their having minimal areas; and at the hanging drop shapes of some Foraminifera such as Lagena. He argues that the cells of trypanosomes are similarly shaped by surface tension.|$|E

Under its weight, the ears seemed to have collapsed. He wore a kind of long, black coat, covered in mud and held in place by a string. He used another piece of string for a belt, and from it hung a pot for boiling water, a tea strainer, a canteen, and other useful things. He walked slightly bent forward, followed everywhere by the noise of the things clashing at his waist.|$|E

5|$|If the {{steering}} of a bike is locked, it becomes {{virtually impossible to}} balance while riding. On the other hand, if the gyroscopic effect of rotating bike wheels is cancelled by adding counter-rotating wheels, it is still easy to balance while riding. One other way that a bike can be balanced, with or without locked steering, is by applying appropriate torques between the bike and rider similar to the <b>way</b> <b>a</b> gymnast can swing up from hanging straight down on uneven parallel bars, a person can start swinging on a swing from rest by pumping their legs, or a double inverted pendulum can be controlled with an actuator only at the elbow.|$|E
