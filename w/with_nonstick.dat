50|$|A whisk is {{a cooking}} utensil {{which can be}} used to blend {{ingredients}} smooth or to incorporate air into a mixture, in a process known as whisking or whipping. Most whisks consist of a long, narrow handle with a series of wire loops joined at the end. The wires are usually metal, but some are plastic for use <b>with</b> <b>nonstick</b> cookware. Whisks are also made from bamboo.|$|E
40|$|The {{motion of}} a liquid under the {{influence}} of surface tension is a phenomenon we experience every day when we take a shower, drink a cup of coffee, or turn on the windshield wipers. All of these realworld situations involve not only the motion of the liquid and surrounding air but also their interaction with adjacent hard surfaces. As we know from waxing our cars and cooking <b>with</b> <b>nonstick</b> cookware, the dynamics of a fluid coating a solid surface depend heavily on the surface chemistry. Many industrial processes, ranging from spin coating of microchips to de-icing of airplane wings, rely on the ability to control these interactions. An ongoing challenge is to explain the underlying physics of the motion of a contact line, a triple juncture of the solid/air, solid/liquid, and liquid/air interfaces. When the system is at rest, the three interfacial energies, determined by the energy per unit area γS (S =sa, sl, or la) on each surface, are in balance, and an equilibrium contact angle θ satisfying (1) γsa−γsl−γla cosθ = 0 results. (See Figure 1. A derivation appears in [13].) However, the dynamically evolving contact line requires much more subtle modeling involving the interaction among multiple-length scales; {{the reason for this is}} born in the underlying fluid dynamics. Andrea L. Bertozzi is associate professor of mathematics at Duke University. Her e-mail address is bertozzi@ math. duke. edu. The classical theory of fluids [1] tells us that when a viscous fluid meets a solid boundary, the correct model for the boundary is a “no-slip ” condition on the solid/liquid interface. 1 Mathematically this requires setting the fluid velocity to be zero on the solid boundary. While this makes sense for the Navier-Stokes equations (describing the motion of an incompressible fluid) in bounded domains, its relevance to the moving contact line problem is dubious. The problem is that a moving contact line coupled with a no-slip condition on the liquid/solid interface results in a multivalued velocity field. This means that the velocity field is not 1 See [15], pp. 676 – 680, for a comprehensive discussion of the history of the “no-slip ” boundary condition...|$|E
40|$|Current {{research}} {{on the effectiveness of}} silicone bakeware is extremely limited; trade journals, magazine articles and newspapers are the only available sources of information on this topic. This literature claims that silicone bakeware is <b>nonstick</b> <b>with</b> ease of product removal and cleaning and provides for even heat distribution. The purpose of this work is to evaluate these claims and to compare the quality of silicone-baked items to similar items baked in standard bake pans using visual, physical and sensory evaluation techniques. The results of this study determine that cake products baked in traditional metal bakeware showed better crust color and texture development and delivered a moister product. The silicone bakeware produced a cake with greater volume...|$|R
50|$|When Circulon was introduced, the nonstick {{system was}} so unique in {{extending}} {{the durability of}} nonstick cookware that it was granted a patent. The unique Circulon Hi-Low surface made the pans {{at least three times}} more abrasion-resistant than any other nonstick cookware on the market. Anolon followed in 1986 as the first hard-anodized <b>nonstick</b> <b>with</b> a smooth cooking surface (and heavier-gauge aluminum than Circulon). Unfortunately, Cheng did not patent the hard-anodized nonstick process, which allowed competitors to develop similar products. He still develops unique technologies and pans for Meyer, including Infinite Circulon's impact-bonded base and the Anolon Outdoor BBQ Pan, respectively. Cheng won the Humanitarian of the Year award from the Housewares Charity Foundation in 2002.|$|R
