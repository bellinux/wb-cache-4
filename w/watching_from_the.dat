5|$|McCabe {{spent most}} of the 193435 Australian season <b>watching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sidelines. The first match of the summer was a {{testimonial}} for retiring Australian captain Woodfull. McCabe was forced to retire hurt when on five, and he missed more than two months of cricket. He returned for only one match, scoring 92 and 53 as New South Wales were defeated by arch-rivals Victoria.|$|E
5|$|Born in {{the city}} of St Albans, Hertfordshire, Gibbs {{attended}} How Wood primary school, and as a nine-year-old striker helped his team win a district six-a-side competition. Gibbs began training with and supporting Watford from an early age, and was <b>watching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Main Stand at Vicarage Road as Watford sealed the Fourth Division title in 1978. Although part of Watford's youth system, he occasionally played for St Albans City's youth team due to their close proximity to his home and school. He also played for Hertfordshire schools at under-14 to under-16 levels.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Île de France in December, Lhermitte steered for Port Louis but {{was intercepted}} by the British {{blockade}} squadron, comprising the 74-gun ship {{of the line}} HMS Tremendous and the 50-gun HMS Adamant. Unable to reach safety, Lhermitte evaded pursuit long enough to drive Preneuse onto a beach {{at the mouth of}} the Tombeau. After a brief exchange of fire the wrecked frigate was surrendered and British boarding parties in ship's boats rowed inshore to Preneuse, removed the survivors and burnt the remains. <b>Watching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> shore as the last of his command burned on the beach, Sercey subsequently retired from military service.|$|E

5|$|The {{physical}} {{arrangement of}} the amphitheatre represented the order of Roman society: the emperor presiding in his opulent box; senators and equestrians <b>watching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> advantageous seats reserved for them; women seated at a remove from the action; slaves given the worst places, and everybody else packed in-between. The crowd could call for an outcome by booing or cheering, but the emperor had the final say. Spectacles could quickly become sites {{of social and political}} protest, and emperors sometimes had to deploy force to put down crowd unrest, most notoriously at the Nika riots in the year 532, when troops under Justinian slaughtered thousands.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2008–09 season, Ebsary gained {{selection}} to the Australian national team and made her One Day International (ODI) debut in the home series against India. She made 37 runs at 18.50, and after scoring 207 runs in the WNCL season, was retained in the national team. After making her ODI top-score of 86 in the Rose Bowl series against New Zealand, she was selected for the 2009 World Cup, but {{was in and out of}} the team, making 106 runs at 35.33. In June 2009, she played in all of Australia's matches at the 2009 World Twenty20 and made her Test debut against England in a bilateral series after the World Twenty20. Ebsary scored 211 runs during the 2009–10 WNCL season to retain her position in the national squad for the Rose Bowl series, but after a series of poor performances, she spent the latter half of the campaign <b>watching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sidelines.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Australian season, Poulton was {{selected}} for the ODI team the ICC Women's Quadrangular Series in Chennai, India. In addition to the hosts and Australia, New Zealand and England were also participating, and each team played each other twice in the round-robin phase. Poulton scored only 8 and 0 from 21 and 8 balls respectively as Australia lost their first two matches against New Zealand and India respectively. She was then dropped for the next two games. She was recalled for the penultimate round-robin match against England but did not bat in a six-wicket win, and then made 27 as Australia defeated India by four wickets in the last match. The Australians needed 231 for victory—4.62 runs per over—and Poulton got their innings off to a slow start, taking 75 balls to accumulate her runs, scoring at {{less than half of the}} required rate. However, her teammates sped up and reached the target from the last ball of the match to qualify for the final against New Zealand. Australia won by six wickets with the dropped Poulton <b>watching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sidelines. She ended the series with 35 runs at 11.66 with a strike rate of only 33.65, was then overlooked for the Rose Bowl series against New Zealand held in Darwin in July.|$|E

5|$|Kartik {{started the}} 2004–05 season by scoring 56 and 16 and taking 2/42 and 2/49 as the Rest of India {{defeated}} Mumbai in the Irani Trophy, {{but it was}} not enough to prevent Harbhajan from resuming his position in the team for the home Test series against Australia. He got an opportunity in the Third Test in Nagpur, when Harbhajan was ill, taking 3/57 and 2/74 as India were 342 runs to lose their first home series to Australia since 1969–70. Kartik held his place when Harbhajan returned for the final Test in Mumbai as India fielded three spinners, and took 4/44 and 3/32 in a man of the match performance which saw India win by 13 runs. Both of these performances occurred under the captaincy of Rahul Dravid with Ganguly injured, in which Kartik netted his wickets at an average of 17.50 compared to 51.08 under Ganguly's leadership. Kartik played the last of his eight Tests in a subsequent opening match against South Africa in Kanpur, taking a total of 2/93 under Ganguly's command, being dropped after India chose to only use two spinners in subsequent matches. Kartik spent the next month <b>watching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sidelines as the reserve slow bowler, as only Kumble and Harbhajan played during the tour of Bangladesh. During this campaign, he was allowed to play in the second ODI, taking 2/43 as India lost to Bangladesh for the first time. Kartik returned to India and took seven wickets at 35.42 at an economy rate of 4.69 in the zonal one-dayers and Challenger Trophy, and then played four first-class matches to end the season, taking 10 wickets at 19.10. At the end of the season, he took 2/54 in a home ODI against Pakistan, who scored 7/319 to overhaul the target.|$|E
25|$|The {{next game}} {{was at home}} against Ipswich Town F.C., with academy manager Darren Wassall in charge and McClaren <b>watching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> stands. Bryson captained the side {{for the first time}} in the match and Derby ended the first half 4–1 down, but after a half-time team talk from McClaren, who also made two substitutions, Derby came back to draw 4–4, with Bryson scoring twice, {{including}} the last, an 88th-minute equaliser.|$|E

Lykens and local lifesavers <b>watching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> shore were helpless to provide any assistance because {{of the severity of}} the storm. Despite the accident, Lykens remained a frequent visitor to ports in New England.|$|E

25|$|Hunter was {{selected}} for the 2010 World Twenty20 in the West Indies but spent almost the entire tournament <b>watching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sidelines, playing in only the two warm-up matches. In the first warm-up match, against New Zealand, she took 0/19 from two overs as New Zealand made 136 and then did not bat as Australia made 5/118. In the second preparatory she took 1/17 from four overs as the Australians defeated Pakistan by 82 runs. Hunter was not used in the tournament itself, after succumbing to a shoulder injury, and the three pace bowlers used were Clea Smith, Ellyse Perry and Rene Farrell. Australia won all three group matches, and then the semi-final and final to take the tournament.|$|E

25|$|Bradman {{had only}} made 28, {{when he played}} Bill Voce into the slips. Jack Ikin caught the ball and threw it {{high in the air}} in joy. He had caught the great Bradman, and Australia, he thought, were three down for under a hundred on a good wicket. That was how it looked to Ikin, to some of the other English players and some of the crowd, and that was how it looked to me sitting <b>watching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{dressing}} room. Bradman, however, thought it was a bump ball and he stayed, as he was fully entitled to do if there was any doubt in his mind... the umpire gave him not out and he went on to make 187 of Australia's total of 645.|$|E

25|$|Dan Evans (Bale) is {{an impoverished}} rancher and Civil War veteran. He owes money to Glen Hollander (Loftin) {{and when he}} fails to pay, two of Hollander's men set fire to his barn. The next morning, as Evans and his two sons look for their herd, they stumble upon outlaw Ben Wade (Crowe) and his gang, who have taken {{advantage}} of Evans' cattle in order to block the road and ambush an armored stagecoach staffed by Pinkerton agents. As Wade's outfit loots the upended stage, Wade discovers Evans and his two sons <b>watching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hills. Determining that they pose no threat to him and his gang, Wade takes their horses and tells Evans that he will leave them tied up on the road to Bisbee. Wade's gang departs, and Evans rescues the lone surviving coach guard, Byron McElroy (Fonda), left alive but severely wounded by Wade.|$|E
25|$|The ODIs were {{followed}} by three T20 matches at Bellerive Oval in Hobart and two more in New Zealand. Haynes played in all five as New Zealand completed a clean sweep. In the first match, her T20 debut, she came in at No. 6 and was unbeaten on 14 from 16 balls and <b>watching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> non-striker's end as her partner Alyssa Healy was caught from the last ball of the match, handing New Zealand a two-run win. In the following match, Australia batted first and Haynes was promoted to No. 4, but struggled to generate momentum, making 15 from 22 balls. In the third match, she was out for 16 from as many balls at No. 6, run out as Australia lost their third match in a row. She continued to struggle {{in the last two}} matches, making 5 from 7 balls in Wellington before being promoted to open in the final match in Christchurch, making 3 from 5 balls. Haynes was not successful in the T20s, scoring 53 runs at 13.25 at a strike rate of 80.25. She bowled for the only time during the bilateral series in the fourth T20 match, taking 3/19 from two overs.|$|E
25|$|The Pacers {{got off to}} a 13–2 {{start in}} 2002–03, but hit the wall after the All-Star break thanks in no small part to Ron Artest's {{multiple}} suspensions and family tragedies befalling Jermaine O'Neal, Jamaal Tinsley and Austin Croshere. O'Neal and Brad Miller both made the All-Star team and the Pacers made a substantial improvement as they finished 48–34, but they suffered a loss to the underdog Boston Celtics {{in the first round of}} the playoffs. In the 2003 offseason, the Pacers managed to re-sign O'Neal for the NBA maximum and inked Reggie Miller to a modest two-year deal, but they could not afford to keep their talented center, Brad Miller. He was dealt to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for Scot Pollard, who spent much of the following year <b>watching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bench and backing up Jeff Foster. The Pacers also signed Larry Bird as team president, and Bird wasted little time in dismissing coach Isiah Thomas and replacing him with Rick Carlisle. The Pacers responded to Carlisle extremely well, and had a breakthrough 2003–04 season in which they finished 61–21, earning the best record in the NBA as well as a franchise record. O'Neal and Artest made the All-Star team, and Artest was named the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year, the Pacers swept the Boston Celtics easily in the first round, and squeezed by a scrappy Miami Heat team in the conference semifinals. But the Detroit Pistons proved an impediment to Indiana's championship aspirations, as they defeated the Pacers in six games on their way to the NBA Championship.|$|E

25|$|Edwards {{made her}} senior debut for Victoria mid-way through the 2000–01 season soon after turning 19. At {{this stage of}} her career, Edwards was a {{specialist}} batsman and did not bowl her first ball in senior cricket until six years later. She was not productive with the bat in her first two seasons, and was dropped after making a duck in her only innings of the third season. Up to this point, she had made only 165 runs at 11.00. She regained {{her place in the}} 2003–04 season but averaged less than 10. Nevertheless, she was selected for the Australian Under-23 team and made 51 and 97 in matches against the Sri Lankan national team. Edwards made her breakthrough in the 2004–05 WNCL, scoring 281 runs, more than she had made in her first four seasons combined. She was selected for the 2005 tour of England, but was not selected in the Tests; she made her One Day International (ODI) debut in the last match but neither batted or bowled. Edwards was then dropped from the national team and did not play for Australia again until a solitary ODI {{at the start of the}} 2006–07 season. After scoring 332 runs in the WNCL season, she was given a consistent run in the national team for the first time, playing in just over half the matches during the year. She made only 37 runs at 7.40 and spent most of the following season's international fixtures <b>watching</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sidelines as a reserve, playing in only two ODIs.|$|E
