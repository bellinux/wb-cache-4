25|$|The {{court ruled}} that Giskegjerde Schjetne was still alive when {{she arrived at the}} trailer, and that some time later she was killed by blunt force trauma to the head, causing massive bleeding. The court came to this {{conclusion}} after hearing the analysis of a bloody mattress which was found inside the trailer. It further ruled that Giske had decided to kill Giskegjerde Schjetne in order to conceal the kidnapping.

500|$|Because {{there was}} no food for the {{passengers}} on the PT boats, Jean and MacArthur's aide-de-camp, Lieutenant Colonel Sidney L. Huff, packed tins of food into four duffel bags, one for each PT boat. Huff removed the four-star rank number plates from MacArthur's car {{so they could be}} used in Australia, and took a mattress for the MacArthurs to lie on. Stories later circulated that it was full of cash or gold. Other stories had it that furniture from MacArthur's residence in the Manila Hotel had been loaded on board the PT boats, even, in one version of the story, the piano. In fact, each passenger was limited to one piece of luggage weighing [...] or less. Jean took a small suitcase with some clothes. It sported a label from the Hotel New Grand in Yokohama, where she stayed during her honeymoon. Ah Cheu <b>wrapped</b> <b>her</b> possessions in a handkerchief. MacArthur took nothing.|$|E
500|$|Oakley, Inc. {{provided}} the red-lensed glasses worn by Cyclops, a customized {{version of the}} company's own X-Metal Juliet. Wolverine's claws required no cast of Hugh Jackman's hands, and were built so he could easily put them on and take them off for safety reasons. Production had insisted that they be attached at all times under a full prosthetic sleeve but designer Gordon Smith refused to do it. Production also insisted on real metal blades, which Smith also refused to do, making injection-moulded plaster blades instead. Hundreds of pairs were built for Jackman and his stunt doubles. Rebecca's wore 110 individual silicone prosthetic, Only the edges were glued, the rest were self-sticking. The prosthetics were built flat and <b>wrapped</b> <b>her</b> body. They were internally colored with food coloring and needed additional makeup or paint. The original agreed to and tested design was, to color her skin with cosmetic grade food coloring as well, which looked remarkable, says Gordon Smith, {{but at the last}} minute Bryan Singer insisted on painting her skin to look opaque, as in the comic book, which added 6 hours to the makeup, making the ordeal very difficult for her. [...] There were also no facilities provided to exhaust paint fumes, during one of Canada's colder winters. Romijn reflected, [...] "I had almost no contact {{with the rest of the}} cast; it was like I was making a different movie from everyone else. It was hell." ...|$|E

2500|$|On March 18, he lured 21-year-old Theresa Wait Ferguson {{away from}} the Merritt Square Mall in Merritt Island, Florida and murdered her, dumping her body at Canaveral Groves, where it was {{discovered}} on March 23. His next victim was 19-year-old Linda Grover from Florida State University, whom he abducted from the Governor's Square Mall in Tallahassee, Florida, and transported to Bainbridge, Georgia, on March 20. She had declined his offer to photograph her for a modeling agency, after which he assaulted her in the mall parking lot, bound her hands, <b>wrapped</b> <b>her</b> in a blanket, {{and put her in}} the trunk of his car. That night, in room 30 of the Glen Oaks Motel, he raped her, and then used a blow dryer and super glue to blind her. He [...] tortured her further by applying copper wires to her feet and passing an electric current through them.

2500|$|On one occasion, as Stephen was mopping {{the kitchen}} floor with a cloth, Rose accidentally stepped into the bowl of water he had been using to perform this task. In response, Rose smashed the boy {{over the head with}} the bowl, then {{repeatedly}} kicked him in the head and chest as she shouted: [...] "You did that on purpose, you little swine!" [...] On another occasion, Rose became hysterical at a missing kitchen utensil, then grabbed a knife she had been using to cut a slab of meat, repeatedly inflicting light scour marks to Mae's chest until her rib cage was covered with light knife wounds. All the while, Mae had screamed, [...] "No, Mum! No, Mum!" [...] as Stephen and Heather stood by, helplessly sobbing. Even Fred occasionally became the recipient of Rose's violence. On one occasion in the late 1970s, Rose chased after Fred with a carving knife in her hand, although Fred was able to slam shut the door of the room into which he had run as Rose plunged at him with the knife, resulting in the knife embedding itself in the door, and Rose's fingers sliding down the blade, almost severing them from her hand.
