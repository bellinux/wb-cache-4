In exchange for this, the MILF will stop armed movements against the government for autonomy and will allow the national government to retain its control of national security and foreign policy. The autonomy agreement to be gradually implemented will also rename the region Bangsamoro after the Moro people.|$|E

Thank {{you for the}} really heartfelt welcome you gave us unfortunate souls from Stutthof when we arrived after {{months or even years}} of suffering, {{culminating}} in 11 days of extreme peril. As a result of poor sanitation and terrible conditions, there was typhus on our ship. Disease spread terrifyingly among us, claiming many lives. Without food, we were driven through wind and storm until we landed happily on the little Danish island of Møn. Its inhabitants received us as if we were their own. You took care of us with real concern, you took the sick off the ship and did your very best for us. Our story is full of gratitude. Special thanks to the Red Cross which, under Mrs Mortensen's leadership, and all the time and strength she devoted to us, has given us back both spiritually and physically so much of what we missed in Stutthof. Just as warmly, <b>we</b> <b>thank</b> <b>the</b> doctors, especially Dr Fenger, Dr Mortensen and Miss Sønderskov, and all the others in Klintholm and the rest of Møn, even if unfortunately we can no longer remember all their names.

"The BAC's {{renovation}} of the former Division 16 Police Station at 951 Boylston Street into studios, workshops, and community gathering spaces {{marks the first time}} in nearly half a century that we have opened a new building for teaching professional design," [...] said President Ted Landsmark.

Our practitioner-educators now have appropriate spaces within which to teach across the disciplines of architecture, interior design, landscape architecture, and design studies. This new Back Bay space enables us to bring together design professionals who think innovatively about how design can address pressing urban, environmental, health and wellness, and sustainability problems, and supports our engagement with diverse individuals and groups that use design to improve human living, work, and recreational conditions. <b>We</b> <b>thank</b> <b>the</b> many people who have brought this long-sought dream to fruition, and we are pleased to welcome new colleagues and friends to the BAC's Boylston Street campus facility. The former Back Bay Police Station Division 16 was built in 1887 and subsequently served as home to Boston's Institute of Contemporary Art.
