5000|$|One of {{the things}} that makes Digitaria exilis unique is its {{physicochemical}} properties. The physicochemical properties of Digitaria exilis can differ depending on if its starch is natural or succinylated. The pH of succinylated Digitaria exilis is lower than that of natural Digitaria exilis. This could be because some of the molecules introduced by succinylation resembled those of acetylation. While succinylation does decrease the pH of starch, it can increase some of its properties such as bulk density and <b>water</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity.</b> The difference in bulk density is caused by the particle size decreasing as the bulk density increases.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of our study}} is to show {{the importance of the}} chemical modification, by grafting, of cellulose {{in order to get a}} material with an improved absorption and retention. Acrylic monomers, acrylic acid (AA) and acrylonitrile (AN) were grafted onto cellulose by using a free radical process initiated by cerie ions. Fibrous supports used were: a Kraft fluff pulp, rayon fibers and short cotton fibers. Major factors affecting graft co-polymerization of acrylonitrile and acrylic acid onto cellulose, (surface morphology, initiation process, reaction temperature) were studied. The <b>water</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>capacities</b> and grafting values of modified cellulose were also determined. The maximum grafting yield was obtained at room temperature by using a CAN initiation technique. Saline solution (0, 9 % NaCI) absorbency was also studied, due to the counter ion effect retention of 0, 9 % aqueous NaCl was about 70 % of the water retention value. The grafting has been confirmed by infrared analysis through the apparition of characteristic strips of monomers on spectrum of grafted samples. The absorbency of the grafted samples is significantly higher than that observed for the native cellulose. Acrylic functions grafted onto cellulose, have otherwise, improved liquid retention of sample...|$|R
40|$|The {{processing}} of boiled Prosopis africana endosperm for better utilization using ethanol-water mixtures was explored. Prosopis africana seeds were boiled for 5 h to softness and the endosperm fraction {{separated from the}} kernel (cotyledon) and the hull. The endosperm was divided into five equal parts which were individually macerated in absolute (Abs) ethanol, 80, 60 and 40 % ethanol in water prior to sun-drying (32 ± 2 °C, 3 days). The fifth sample, which served as control, was left untreated with ethanol. The samples were ground using a hand milling machine and analyzed for the proximate composition, <b>water</b> and oil <b>absorption</b> <b>capacities,</b> foaming capacity and foam stability, bulk density, emulsion activity and stability, colour preference, texture preference and overall acceptability. The results revealed that treatment of the endosperm significantly affected the moisture, protein, fat, ash and carbohydrate contents; <b>water</b> and oil <b>absorption</b> <b>capacities,</b> foaming capacity and foam stability; and the sensory properties. The moisture and protein contents, oil <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity,</b> foam stability, appearance, texture and overall acceptability of endosperm treated with 40 % ethanol in water differed significantly (p< 0. 05) from that treated with absolute ethanol. There was also significant (p< 0. 05) differences in moisture, protein and carbohydrate contents, oil <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity</b> and foam stability of the 40 % ethanol in water treated endosperm and the control. Slightly above 40 % ethanol in water (50 - 60 %) {{should be used to}} macerate Prosopis africana endosperm to reduce the cost of using absolute ethanol...|$|R
40|$|International audienceYak caseins {{are special}} {{materials}} which has attracted {{more and more}} attention of researchers due to its increasing. Succinylation is a useful method of improving the functional properties of protein significantly. This study assessed the effects of succinylation on the functional properties of yak and cow caseins, including solubility, emulsifying property, <b>water</b> and oil <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity,</b> foaming property, and digestibility. Six succinylated levels of caseins were prepared by adding different amounts of succinic anhydride to caseins. The succinylated degree of yak and cow caseins was different when similar amounts of succinic anhydride were added. Succinylation improved solubility, emulsifying activity, <b>water</b> and oil <b>absorption</b> <b>capacity,</b> and reduced foam stability and digestibility of yak and cow native caseins. However, succinylation decreased foaming capacity and emulsion stability of cow caseins while increased them of yak caseins. The functional properties of caseins changed irregularly with increasing levels of succinylation. The {{findings of this study}} revealed that succinylation had different effects on the functional properties of different sources of caseins. The results will provide the basic data of functional properties of yak native caseins and succinylated yak caseins...|$|R
