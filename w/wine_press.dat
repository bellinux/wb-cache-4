25|$|The {{history of}} the <b>wine</b> <b>press</b> and of {{pressing}} is nearly {{as old as the}} history of wine itself with the remains of wine presses providing some of the longest-serving evidence of organised viticulture and winemaking in the ancient world. The earliest <b>wine</b> <b>press</b> was probably the human foot or hand, crushing and squeezing grapes into a bag or container where the contents would ferment.|$|E
25|$|The {{advancement}} of steam power machinery in the 19th century {{brought about a}} revolution in <b>wine</b> <b>press</b> technology as manual basket press gave way to steam-powered presses that greatly increased the efficiency of pressing and reduced the amount labor needed to operate a press. Even the {{advancement of}} rail transport had a positive influence {{as the cost of}} transporting large wine presses from manufacturers to wine regions throughout the globe decreased and more wineries began being able to afford purchasing a <b>wine</b> <b>press.</b>|$|E

25|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans {{developed}} {{large wooden}} wine presses that utilized large beams, capstans and windlasses to exert {{pressure on the}} pomace. That style of <b>wine</b> <b>press</b> would eventually evolve into the basket press used in the Middle Ages by wine estates of the nobility and Catholic Church. There are many church records that showed feudal land tenants {{were willing to pay}} a portion of their crop to use a landlord's <b>wine</b> <b>press</b> if it was available. This was likely because added volume of wine (anywhere from 15-20%) that pressing could produce versus manual treading was substantial enough to justify the cost.|$|E
25|$|The town of New Norcia has {{buildings}} in a Spanish style of architecture, {{along with some}} other historical sites. Among these are the two old boarding schools, St Ildephonsus' and St Gertrude's (both now used for accommodation and various social functions), the Abbey Church (containing the tomb of Rosendo Salvado), an old mill, a <b>wine</b> <b>press,</b> a hotel and the monastery itself.|$|E
25|$|In the 17th and 18th century, {{the style}} of {{winemaking}} in France was for heartier wines that could age and survive long transport voyages over seas. Winemaking text such as the 1803 annotated and updated edition of de Serres' Théâtre d'Agriculture began recommending that all fine producers employ {{the use of a}} <b>wine</b> <b>press</b> and that sometimes blending in a bit of the vin de presse to enhance color and body was essential to create a wine that could last. Even in Bordeaux, which was still using lagars long after Burgundy, Champagne and other French wine regions had adopted the basket press, saw the use of a <b>wine</b> <b>press</b> become more popular after darker, more full bodied wines of Ho-Bryan produced by Lord Arnaud III de Pontac began receive wide acclaim from English writers such as Jonathan Swift, John Locke and Samuel Pepys. By the end of the 18th century, nearly all prestigious Bordeaux wine estates were following de Pontac's method of giving the grapes more time to ferment in the vat and then using a basket press on the darker vin vermeilh and pressing it into new oak barrels.|$|E

25|$|On 23 July 1948, on David Ben-Gurion's insistence over General Staff opposition, Dayan was {{appointed}} military commander of Jewish-controlled areas of Jerusalem. In this post, he launched two military offensives. Both were night-time operations and both failed. On 17 August, he sent two companies {{to attempt to}} occupy the hillsides around Government House, but they retreated suffering casualties. On the night of 20 October 1948, {{to coincide with the}} end of Operation Yoav further south, Operation <b>Wine</b> <b>Press</b> was launched. Its objective was to capture Bethlehem via Beit Jala. Six companies set out but were pinned down by machine-gun fire in the wadi below Beit Jala and were forced to withdraw.|$|E
25|$|Machine {{pressing}} {{became even}} more widespread in the 17th and 18th century as the style of winemaking in France {{and other parts of}} Europe was shifting towards heartier wines that could age and survive long transport voyages over seas. Winemaking text began recommending the use of mechanical pressings over feet treading in lagars. Even in Bordeaux, which was still using lagars long after Burgundy, Champagne and other French wine regions had adopted the basket press, saw the use of a <b>wine</b> <b>press</b> become more popular after darker, more full bodied wines of Ho-Bryan produced by Lord Arnaud III de Pontac began receive wide acclaim from English writers.|$|E
25|$|Pressing in {{winemaking}} is {{the process}} where juice is extracted from grapes. This {{can be done with}} the aid of a <b>wine</b> <b>press,</b> by hand, or even by the weight of the grape berries and clusters. Historically, intact grape clusters were trodden by feet but in most wineries today the grapes are sent through a crusher/destemmer, which removes the individual grape berries from the stems and breaks the skins, releasing some juice, prior to being pressed. There are exceptions, such as the case of sparkling wine production in regions such as Champagne where grapes are traditionally whole-cluster pressed with stems included to produce a lighter must that is low in phenolics.|$|E

25|$|Cato {{described}} {{the process of}} pressing as taking place in a special room that included an elevated concrete platform containing a shallow basin with raised curbs. The basin was shaped with gentle slopes {{that led to a}} runoff point. Horizontally across the basin were long, wooden beams whose front parts were attached by rope to a windlass. The crushed grapes were placed between the beams, with pressure applied by winding down the windlass. The pressed juice ran down between the beams and collected in the basin. As the construction and use of a <b>wine</b> <b>press</b> was labor-intensive and expensive, its use was generally restricted to large estates, with smaller wineries relying on treading alone to obtain grape juice.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, reports {{surfaced}} that Italian {{authorities were}} investigating claims that several major Brunello producers were adulterating their wines by using foreign or domestic grape varieties {{in violation of}} the DOCG regulations, which stipulate that only Sangiovese may be used to make Brunello. The prosecutor handling the investigation said he would bring commercial fraud charges that could result in imprisonment for the violators. The producers in question were suspected of adding wine made from non-approved grapes {{in order to make it}} more appealing to the international market. In response the U.S. government blocked imports of Brunello that did not have proof that they were in fact 100% Sangiovese. The scandal was coined Brunellopoli by the Italian <b>wine</b> <b>press.</b>|$|E
25|$|While {{the basket}} press was {{becoming}} more widely used by Church owned estates in France and Germany, winemaking in the Iberian peninsula and by small local farmers throughout Europe was still mostly down by treading in stone lagers. However, there are many church records that showed feudal land tenants {{were willing to pay}} a portion of their crop to use a landlord's <b>wine</b> <b>press</b> if it was available. This was probably due in part to added volume of wine (anywhere from 15-20%) that pressing could produce versus treading. But safety could have also been a driving force since many parish records from the period reported wine cellar works suffocating to death (from the released carbon dioxide) while treading fermenting wine grapes in a vat.|$|E

25|$|The {{more modern}} {{idea of a}} piece of a {{winemaking}} equipment used to extract the juice from the skins probably emerged during the Greco-Roman periods where written accounts by Cato the Elder, Marcus Terentius Varro, Pliny the Elder and others described wooden wine presses that utilized large beams, capstans and windlasses to exert pressure on the pomace. The wines produced by these presses were usually darker, with more color extracted from the skins but could also be more harsh with bitter tannins also extracted. That style of <b>wine</b> <b>press</b> would eventually evolve into the basket press used in the Middle Ages by wine estates of the nobility and Catholic Church leading to the modern tank batch and continuous presses used in wineries today.|$|E
25|$|At Economy the Harmonists {{intended}} {{to become more}} involved in manufacturing and their new town on the Ohio River provided better access to eastern markets and water access {{to the south and}} west than they had in Indiana. By 1826 the Harmonists had woolen and cotton mills in operation as well as a steam-operated grain mill. The Harmonist society also ran a <b>wine</b> <b>press,</b> a hotel, post office, saw mills, stores, and a variety of farms. Here, under the business acumen and efficient management of Frederick Rapp, they enjoyed such prosperity that by 1829 they dominated trade and the markets of Pittsburgh and down the Ohio River. The Harmonists' competitors accused them of creating a monopoly and called on state government to dissolve the group. Despite the attacks, the Harmonists developed Economy into a prosperous factory town, engaged in farming on a large scale, and maintained a brewery, distillery, and wine-making operation. They also pioneered the manufacturing of silk in the United States.|$|E
