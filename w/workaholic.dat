5|$|A vegetarian, Modi has a frugal {{lifestyle}} {{and is a}} <b>workaholic</b> and introvert. Adept at using social media, he has been since September 2014 the second-most-followed leader in the world (with over 34.6 million followers on Twitter as of September 2017), behind Barack Obama (95.6 million followers) and Donald Trump(38.8 million followers). Modi's 31 August 2012 post on Google Hangouts made him the first Indian politician to interact with netizens on live chat. Modi has also been called a fashion-icon for his signature crisply ironed, half-sleeved kurta, {{as well as for}} a suit with his name embroidered repeatedly in the pinstripes that he wore during a state visit by US President Barack Obama, which drew public and media attention and criticism. Modi's personality has been variously described by scholars and biographers as energetic, arrogant, and charismatic.|$|E
40|$|The term workaholism, {{patterned}} after the word alcoholism, {{first appeared in}} a book by Oates (1971) in which he described workaholism as a compulsive or uncontrollable need to work incessantly, resulting in negative consequences. Research has yielded mixed results {{in relation to the}} impact workaholism can have on people’s lives. Some authors view workaholism in positive terms (Machlowitz, 1980), while others view it in negative terms (Robinson, 1998). This study focused on the relationship between workaholism and health and well-being. An online, self report questionnaire, which included the Workaholism Battery (Spence & Robbins, 1992), was completed by 136 employees throughout New Zealand. Additional measures included work→family conflict, family→work conflict, family satisfaction, anxiety/depression, social dysfunction, positive psychological well-being, negative psychological well-being and physical health symptoms. Participants were classified into one of six groups, consisting of the enthusiastic <b>workaholics,</b> unenthusiastic <b>workaholics,</b> unengaged workers, disenchanted workers, work enthusiasts and relaxed workers. The unenthusiastic <b>workaholics</b> and the enthusiastic <b>workaholics</b> made up the “workaholic” group, and the unengaged workers, disenchanted workers, work enthusiasts and relaxed workers made up the “non-workaholic” group. The main finding of this study was that there were few differences between <b>workaholics</b> and non-workaholics in relation to family→work conflict, family satisfaction, positive psychological well-being, negative psychological well-being, anxiety/depression, social dysfunction and physical health symptoms. The only difference between the <b>workaholics</b> and non-workaholics was that enthusiastic <b>workaholics</b> reported significantly higher levels of work→family conflict compared to relaxed workers. Another important finding of this study was that different types of <b>workaholics</b> reported significantly different levels of psychological well-being. Unenthusiastic <b>workaholics</b> reported significantly lower levels of positive psychological well-being, and significantly higher levels of negative psychological well-being compared to the enthusiastic <b>workaholics.</b> These results suggest that, {{with the exception of the}} comparatively low levels of psychological well-being the unenthusiastic <b>workaholics</b> reported in relation to the enthusiastic <b>workaholics,</b> workaholism may not be as harmful as previously thought. They also provide support for the continued differentiation of multiple types of <b>workaholics,</b> as the unenthusiastic <b>workaholics</b> and the enthusiastic <b>workaholics</b> differed significantly on their reported levels of psychological well-being. Having an excessive drive to work was significantly associated with poor health and well-being, whereas enjoyment of work was associated significantly with high positive levels of health and well-being. Work involvement was much more inconsistently related to health and well-being. On this basis, it may be inferred that excessive drive to work may be the harmful element in workaholism as it produces negative health and lifestyle outcomes, while enjoyment may be a productive factor. Finally, a number of significant relationships were found between the health and well-being variables, suggesting that an individual’s physical, mental and emotional health might be related to one another. The present data suggests that differentiation between different types of <b>workaholics</b> is important. The present data also challenges the negative stereotype of workaholism, and emphasises the importance of developing strategies to better manage workaholism within the workplace...|$|R
50|$|Those who exhibit workaholism tend to {{demonstrate}} {{higher levels of}} presenteeism. As defined by Schaufeli, Bakker, van der Heijden, and Prins, <b>workaholics</b> tend to work excessively and compulsively, and they are internally motivated to work to an excessive extent.

50|$|<b>Workaholics</b> {{feel the}} urge of being busy all the time, {{to the point}} that they often perform tasks that are not {{required}} or necessary for project completion. As a result, they tend to be inefficient workers, since they focus on being busy, instead of focusing on being productive. In addition, <b>workaholics</b> tend to be less effective than other workers because they have difficulty working as part of a team, trouble delegating or entrusting co-workers, or organizational problems due to taking on too much work at once. Furthermore, <b>workaholics</b> often suffer sleep deprivation, which results in impaired brain and cognitive function.|$|R

Unskilled workers will almost always have to rely on bare minimum legal requirements. The legal requirements are low in many countries, in particular, the United States.
