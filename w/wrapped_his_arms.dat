60|$|Madeline had {{not time}} {{to grasp the}} sense of his last words. Stewart had convulsively sprung upward, white as chalk. As he leaped at Hawe Stillwell {{interposed}} his huge bulk and <b>wrapped</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> around Stewart. There was a brief, whirling, wrestling struggle. Stewart appeared to be besting the old cattleman.|$|E
60|$|He laid {{hold of her}} {{arm with}} rude, {{powerful}} clutch. One pull drew her sliding half {{out of the saddle}} into his arms. She fell with her breast against his, not wholly free of stirrups or horse, and there she hung, utterly powerless. Maddened, writhing, she tore to release herself. All she could accomplish was to twist herself, raise herself high enough to see his face. That almost paralyzed her. Did he mean to kill her? Then he <b>wrapped</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> around her and crushed her tighter, closer to him. She felt the pound of his heart; her own seemed to have frozen. Then he pressed his burning lips to hers. It was a long, terrible kiss. She felt him shake.|$|E
6000|$|... "Drive? Good gracious! He scared us to death, except Castleton. Nothing could scare that cold-blooded little Englishman. I am dizzy yet. Do you know, Majesty, I {{was delighted}} when I saw the car. Then your cowboy driver met {{us at the}} platform. What a queer-looking individual! He had a big pistol {{strapped}} to those leather trousers. That made me nervous. When he piled us all in with our grips, he {{put me in the}} seat beside him, whether I liked it or not. I was fool enough to tell him I loved to travel fast. What do you think he said? Well, he eyed me in a rather cool and speculative way and said, with a smile, 'Miss, I reckon anything you love an' want bad will be coming to you out here!' I didn't know whether it was delightful candor or impudence. Then he said to all of us: 'Shore you had better wrap up in the veils an' dusters. It's a long, slow, hot, dusty ride to the ranch, an' Miss Hammond's order was to drive safe.' He got our baggage checks and gave them to a man with a huge wagon and a four-horse team. Then he cranked the car, jumped in, <b>wrapped</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> round the wheel, and sank down low in his seat. There was a crack, a jerk, a kind of flash around us, and that dirty little town was somewhere on the map behind. For about five minutes I had a lovely time. Then the wind began to tear me to pieces. I couldn't hear anything but the rush of wind and roar of the car. I could see only straight ahead. What a road! I never saw a road in my life till to-day. Miles and miles and miles ahead, with not even a post or tree. That big car seemed to leap at the miles. It hummed and sang. I was fascinated, then terrified. We went so fast I couldn't catch my breath. The wind went through me, and I expected to be disrobed by it any minute. I was afraid I couldn't hold any clothes on. Presently all I could see was a flashing gray wall with a white line in the middle. Then my eyes blurred. My face burned. My ears grew full of a hundred thousand howling devils. I was about ready to die when the car stopped. I looked and looked, and when I could see, there you stood!" ...|$|E

50|$|The crooked arm lariat is {{performed}} when an attacking wrestler runs towards an opponent with the arm bent upward {{at the elbow}} 60-90 degrees and <b>wraps</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> around their head forcing them to the ground.|$|R
50|$|According to the Swedish tradition, {{when the}} man (a monk) {{returned}} and said the name, Jätten Finn became angry and <b>wrapped</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> around a pillar in order {{to pull it out}} and destroy the cathedral. But at that moment he was turned into stone, and that is why there is a stone man hugging a pillar in the Lund Cathedral this day. Another theory is that the carving represents the biblical figure Samson, who sacrificed himself by toppling the pillars of a Philistine temple.|$|E
50|$|Malignaggi took on Danny García at Barclays Center, Brooklyn, August 1, 2015. It was Malignaggi's {{first step}} up to fight at 147 lbs. Malignaggi was cut above his right eye by the third and had a large welt beneath the right eye by the sixth. At {{the time of the}} stoppage, at the 2:22 mark of the ninth round, Malignaggi was {{absorbing}} a succession of blows as referee Arthur Mercante Jr. stepped in and <b>wrapped</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> around him, signaling the end. Garcia was awarded a technical knockout.|$|E
50|$|In 1976, Jones {{was back}} in the {{starting}} lineup when Pittsburgh rolled into Cleveland for a game with their biggest rivals, the Browns. Although Hal Lebovitz called it Jones' best game {{at the end of the}} third quarter, Jones' legacy as the instigator in one of the dirtiest plays in recent memory was made in the 4th. Jones lined up for a play, beat the offensive lineman (Larry Brown) and <b>wrapped</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> around quarterback Terry Bradshaw. Whistles blew, but Jones ignored them and lifted Bradshaw up high, and slammed the Pittsburgh QB on his head. As Bradshaw laid there motionless on the ground, the officials marched off a 15-yard penalty for roughing. Bradshaw ended up with a concussion, and Jones ended up with a $3,000 fine.|$|E
50|$|This is a move {{in which}} a wrestler will jump from an {{elevated}} position and perform a clothesline to a standing opponent. A version of this move, called a flying lariat, involves the wrestler <b>wrapping</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> around the opponent's head.|$|R

50|$|A stiff-arm fend {{may cause}} the tackler {{to fall to}} the ground, taking {{him out of the}} play. Even if the tackler keeps his feet, it becomes {{impossible}} for him to complete a tackle, as he cannot come close enough to <b>wrap</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> around the ball-carrier.|$|R
50|$|Troiani, at {{the engine}} control signals fared better, being hurled into soft snow and rolling before {{immediately}} jumping {{to his feet}} and cleaning the snow off his glasses, which had survived the crash unscathed. Viglieri and Mariano, standing next to the chart table, briefly saw the rear engine car about to strike the ice hard and then found themselves prostrate but unharmed in a mass of debris. Biagi, with no time to send out an SOS grabbed the portable emergency radio and <b>wrapped</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> around it trying to save it from damage. The impact on the ice winded him but left him inside the wreck of the cabin. Nobile lay unconscious with a head wound, with Malmgren and Zappi nearby.|$|E
50|$|The {{anaconda}} vise is a compression choke. The wrestler <b>wraps</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> {{around the}} head and one arm of the opponent and squeezes, choking the opponent. It is considered legal in professional wrestling, although it is a chokehold. This submission hold was innovated by Hiroyoshi Tenzan.|$|R
5000|$|Short for [...] "stepover toehold sleeper", this hold is a {{modified}} version of an STF in which the wrestler <b>wraps</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> around the neck of the opponent in a sleeper hold instead of pulling back on the head of the opponent. Innovated by Masahiro Chono.|$|R
5000|$|Sara and Nick {{talk for}} a moment and Sara realizes what she needs to do next. Nick begs her not to go by <b>wrapping</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> around her and {{pleading}} with her. Sara pushes him off and then runs out into the sun, screaming in agony as she dies.|$|R

50|$|In wrestling, a lariat is when an attacking wrestler runs {{towards an}} opponent, <b>wraps</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> around their upper chest and neck and then {{forces them to}} the ground. This move {{is similar to a}} clothesline, the {{difference}} being that in a clothesline the wrestler's arm is kept straight {{to the side of the}} wrestler during the move, while in the lariat the wrestler strikes their opponent with <b>his</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|R
50|$|On April 15, 2003, a fan {{came out}} of the stands during the {{baseball}} game between the Kansas City Royals and Chicago White Sox and attacked first base umpire Laz Diaz.

50|$|This backbreaker {{variation}} {{sees the}} wrestler {{standing beside the}} opponent and slightly behind him. Then, he <b>wraps</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> around the opponent's back-neck, and then from the point he catches the opponent's neck, he forces the opponent down in a Russian legsweep style and simultaneously extends a knee. The maneuver results in the opponent's neck or back to be slammed against the wrestler's knee.|$|R
50|$|The wrestler faces his {{opponent}} who is bent over. The attacking wrestler tucks the opponent's head underneath <b>his</b> armpit and <b>wraps</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> {{around the neck}} so that the forearm is pressed against the throat as in a front chancery. The attacking wrestler then <b>wraps</b> <b>his</b> legs around the opponents midsection with a body scissors and then arches backwards, pulling the opponent's head forward, stretching the torso and the neck. It can be performed from either standing, sitting or prone positions.|$|R

50|$|The wrestler faces his {{opponent}} who is bent over.

Similar in execution to a front chancery, the front facelock is often used as a setup for a suplex throw.|$|R
40|$|Colin Myers first {{slept with}} his {{neighbor}} {{four days after}} his eighteenth birthday, but he 2 ̆ 7 d wanted Wanda Mitchell for two long summers.

50|$|It is {{used when}} the player {{carrying}} {{the ball is}} running at speed and a defending player is approaching from behind. Even if the defender {{is not able to}} get close enough to the ball-carrier to <b>wrap</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> around him in a conventional tackle, he may still be able to dive at the other player's feet and, with an outstretched arm, deliver a tap or hook to the player's foot (or feet) causing the player to stumble. At speed, this will often be sufficient to bring the ball-carrier down.|$|R
50|$|Innovated by Jun Akiyama, {{and also}} called a T-bone suplex (named by former wrestler Tazz), the {{attacker}} stands facing his opponent and positions himself {{under one of}} the opponent's <b>arms</b> and <b>wraps</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> around the opponent's neck and back (this position {{is similar to that of}} a side slam) and then grabs the waist or leg of the opponent and tosses him backwards, over the attacker's head. Several other variations exist, such as the wrist-clutch exploder suplex and the bridging exploder suplex. Shelton Benjamin, as seen in the adjacent picture, performs a combination exploder suplex/powerslam as a finishing maneuver.|$|R
