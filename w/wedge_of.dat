5|$|As the {{incipient}} ocean widened in the Late Proterozoic and Early Paleozoic, {{it broke}} the continental crust {{in two and}} a true ocean basin developed to the west. All the earlier formations were thus dissected along a steep front on {{the two halves of}} the previous continent. A <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> clastic sediment then started to accumulate {{at the base of the}} two underwater precipices, starting the formation of opposing continental shelves.|$|E

A <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> clastic sediment {{then began to}} accumulate {{at the base of}} the two underwater precipices, starting the formation of opposing continental shelves. Three formations developed from sediment that accumulated on the wedge. The region's first known fossils of complex life are found in the resulting formations. Notable among these are the Ediacara fauna and trilobites, the evolution of the latter being part of the Cambrian Explosion of life.|$|E

5|$|Across the battlefield, as {{the first}} line of Persian ships was pushed back by the Greeks, they became fouled in the {{advancing}} second and third lines of their own ships. On the Greek left, the Persian admiral Ariabignes (a brother of Xerxes) was killed early in the battle; left disorganised and leaderless, the Phoenician squadrons appear to have been pushed back against the coast, many vessels running aground. In the centre, a <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> Greek ships pushed through the Persians lines, splitting the fleet in two.|$|E
5|$|Dunbeth hill {{where the}} present local {{authority}} municipal buildings stand is a <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> rock {{which was probably}} squeezed upwards {{by the force of}} two (now-extinct) fault lines. There are the remains of spreads of glacial sands along the crest of Drumpellier, the west bank of Gartsherrie Burn and along modern day Bank Street. Kirkwood, Kirkshaws and Shawhead sit on a sandstone capped ridge looking south over the Clyde Valley. The vital Coatbridge black band coal field extended from Langloan to beyond {{the eastern edge of the}} town.|$|E
5|$|With a {{storm track}} {{very close to}} the shore and a {{retreating}} high-pressure area to the northeast, onshore winds allowed temperatures to warm above freezing in eastern and northern New England. A frontal boundary between the warm Atlantic air and a residual <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> colder air over the interior served as the focus for a severe ice storm in central New England. Thunder and lightning accompanied the precipitation in some areas. By 12:00 UTC on December 27, the attendant upper-level trough matured into a closed cold-core low. The nor'easter continued to drift toward the east-northeast over the next 24 hours.|$|E

5|$|Marine {{deposition}} occurred 1200 to 800 Ma, creating thick {{sequences of}} conglomerate, mudstone, and carbonate rock topped by stromatolites, and possibly glacial deposits from the hypothesized Snowball Earth event. Rifting thinned huge roughly linear {{parts of the}} supercontinent Rodinia enough to allow sea water to invade and divide its landmass into component continents separated by narrow straits. A passive margin developed {{on the edges of}} these new seas in the Death Valley region. Carbonate banks formed on this part of the two margins only to be subsided as the continental crust thinned until it broke, giving birth to a new ocean basin. An accretion <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> clastic sediment then started to accumulate {{at the base of the}} submerged precipice, entombing the region's first known fossils of complex life. These sandy mudflats gave way about 550 Ma to a carbonate platform which lasted for the next 300 million years of Paleozoic time.|$|E

25|$|The {{location}} of the removed <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> bone depends on where osteoarthritis has damaged the knee cartilage. The {{most common type of}} osteotomy performed on arthritic knees is a high tibial osteotomy, which addresses cartilage damage on the inside (medial) portion of the knee. The procedure usually takes 60 to 90 minutes to perform.|$|E
25|$|During a high tibial osteotomy, {{surgeons}} {{remove a}} <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> bone {{from the outside}} of the knee, which causes the leg to bend slightly inward. This resembles the realigning of a bowlegged knee to a knock-kneed position. The patient's weight is transferred to the outside (lateral) portion of the knee, where the cartilage is still healthy.|$|E
25|$|Once {{a player}} has {{collected}} one <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> each color and filled up his playing piece, he {{must return to}} the hub and answer a question in a category selected by the other players.

25|$|Knee {{osteotomy}} {{is commonly}} used to realign arthritic damage {{on one side of}} the knee. The goal is to shift the patient's body weight off the damaged area to the other side of the knee, where the cartilage is still healthy. Surgeons remove a <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> the tibia from underneath the healthy side of the knee, which allows the tibia and femur to bend away from the damaged cartilage.|$|E
25|$|Thin-film linear polarizers are glass {{substrates}} {{on which}} a special optical coating is applied. Either Brewster's angle reflections or interference effects in the film cause them to act as beam-splitting polarizers. The substrate for the film can either be a plate, which is inserted into the beam at a particular angle, or a <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> glass that is cemented to a second wedge to form a cube with the film cutting diagonally across the center (one form {{of this is the}} very common MacNeille cube).|$|E
50|$|Round 2 {{was called}} Hot Pursuit. All {{questions}} were toss-up questions worth $500 ($1,000 in some earlier-taped episodes). There were no specific categories; each correct answer simply filled in one <b>wedge,</b> regardless <b>of</b> color. The first player to fill all six <b>wedges</b> <b>of</b> their token won the game. The three wedges {{from the first}} round carried over, so three correct answers won the game.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: 2 ̆ 2 Quasi-static <b>wedging</b> <b>of</b> three-point {{contacts}} is investigated, {{wherein the}} concepts of virtual and redundant wedging due to a resultant force falling into a friction cone are proposed. We consider the fully-started case of a square peg and hole consisting of two point-surface contacts and one line-line contact. An analysis <b>of</b> the <b>wedging</b> diagram for this highly constrained configuration is carried out and compared to the two dimensional case. An approximate wedging diagram is constructed which shows that <b>wedging</b> <b>of</b> square pegs into square holes is more likely than cylindrical pegs and holes of similar sizes. 2 ̆...|$|R
40|$|The growth {{mechanism}} of the grounded ice feature on Hanna's Shoal, located at approximately 162 deg W, 72 deg N in the Chukchi Sea, has been analyzed using Landsat I and II satellite imagery. The primary {{mechanism of}} growth was deduced to be the formation <b>of</b> large <b>wedges</b> <b>of</b> ice against the upstream edge of the feature. These <b>wedges</b> <b>of</b> piled ice form in three stages and {{may or may not}} become permanently affixed to the core of the feature. Remains of these growth patterns can sometimes be seen in the interior of the feature on the satellite imagery...|$|R
25|$|Major outputs for {{the state}} include textiles, cotton, cattle, and {{electrical}} power. Tennessee has over 82,000 farms, roughly 59 percent of which accommodate beef cattle. Although cotton was an early crop in Tennessee, large-scale cultivation of the fiber did not begin until the 1820s {{with the opening of}} the land between the Tennessee and Mississippi Rivers. The upper <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> the Mississippi Delta extends into southwestern Tennessee, and it was in this fertile section that cotton took hold. Soybeans are also heavily planted in West Tennessee, focusing on the northwest corner of the state.|$|E
25|$|Mensa {{is a small}} {{constellation}} in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere {{near the}} south celestial pole, one of twelve constellations drawn up in the 18thcentury by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille. Its name is Latin for table, though it originally depicted Table Mountain and was known as Mons Mensae. One of the 88 modern constellations, it covers a keystone-shaped <b>wedge</b> <b>of</b> sky stretching from approximately 4h to 7.5h of right ascension, and 71 to 85.5 degrees of declination. Other than the south polar constellation of Octans, {{it is the most}} southerly of constellations. As a result, it is essentially unobservable from the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|This border extends {{all the way}} east to the low-tide mark on the New Jersey shore, then {{continues}} south along the shoreline until it again reaches the 12-mile (19km) arc in the south; then the boundary continues in a more conventional way {{in the middle of}} the main channel (thalweg) of the Delaware River. To the west, a portion of the arc extends past the easternmost edge of Maryland. The remaining western border runs slightly east of due south from its intersection with the arc. The <b>Wedge</b> <b>of</b> land between the northwest part of the arc and the Maryland border was claimed by both Delaware and Pennsylvania until 1921, when Delaware's claim was confirmed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{develop the}} theory <b>of</b> {{truncated}} <b>wedge</b> schemes, a higher dimensional analog of jet schemes.
