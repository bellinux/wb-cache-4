McEachran began his spell with regular substitute appearances and after building up his fitness he made something of a breakthrough into the starting lineup, making seven starts from late February through to the end of the season. He started in the Latics' FA Cup quarter-final and semi-final matches versus Manchester City and Arsenal respectively, though his first Wembley appearance in the latter match ended in heartbreak after a shootout defeat. After a fifth-place finish in the Championship saw the Latics qualify for the playoffs, he was bizarrely left out of the squad for both legs of the semi-finals versus Queens Park Rangers, which resulted in a 2-1 aggregate defeat. McEachran finished his spell with 11 appearances.|$|E
