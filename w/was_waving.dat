5|$|The sailor {{offers to}} pay a reward, but Dupin is {{interested}} only in learning the circumstances behind the two murders. The sailor explains that he captured the orangutan while in Borneo and brought it back to Paris, but had trouble keeping it under control. When he saw the orangutan attempting to shave its face with his straight razor, imitating his morning grooming, it fled into the streets and reached the Rue Morgue, where it climbed up and into the house. The orangutan seized the mother by the hair and <b>was</b> <b>waving</b> the razor, imitating a barber; when she screamed in fear, it flew into a rage, ripped her hair out, slashed her throat, and strangled the daughter. The sailor climbed up the lightning rod {{in an attempt to}} catch the animal, and the two voices heard by witnesses belonged to it and to him. Fearing punishment by its master, the orangutan threw the mother's body out the window and stuffed the daughter into the chimney before fleeing.|$|E
25|$|During {{and after}} Eurovision, the media {{reported}} that Adamou and Eleftheria Eleftheriou {{were not in}} a good situation. Both singers stated that everything was okay between them. However, during their performance in the 2013 Greek national final, Eleftheria was to give her hand to Adamou, while Adamou <b>was</b> <b>waving</b> at the audience. Later, Eleftheria said that Adamou didn't do this intentionally. She also said {{that they are in}} a good situation.|$|E
25|$|According to the Warren Commission and the House Select Committee on Assassinations, Kennedy <b>was</b> <b>waving</b> to {{the crowds}} {{on his right}} with his right arm upraised {{on the side of}} the limo when a shot entered his upper back, {{penetrated}} his neck and slightly damaged a spinal vertebra and the top of his right lung. The bullet exited his throat nearly centerline just beneath his larynx and nicked the left side of his suit tie knot. He raised his elbows and clenched his fists in front of his face and neck, then leaned forward and left. Mrs. Kennedy, facing him, then put her arms around him in concern.|$|E

5|$|R.C. MacLeod {{wrote of}} another {{tradition}} which {{stated that the}} flag <b>was</b> <b>waved</b> at a battle in Waternish, in about 1580; and of another which told of how it <b>was</b> <b>waved</b> {{during a time when}} a cattle plague was raging, and that it stopped the murrain. R.C. MacLeod stated his belief that the flag would only have <b>been</b> <b>waved</b> twice, and so rejected the tradition of it being unfurled at the Battle of Bloody Bay—because the MacLeods were on the losing side! R.C. MacLeod also wondered if it had <b>been</b> <b>waved</b> in 1600, when the clan was in a desperate state in the midst of warring with the Macdonalds of Sleat.|$|R

25|$|The Williams team's {{decision}} {{to develop their}} new semi-automatic gearbox by racing with it {{at the start of}} the season, was at the cost of points in the opening rounds of the championship. Senna was on 40 points with four straight wins to open the season by the time Mansell gained his first finish with a second in Monaco. Mansell then had the next race in Canada practically won when his Williams FW14 stopped half a lap from the finish with what was reported to be transmission failure, though it was suspected that Mansell had let his engine revs drop too low while he <b>was</b> <b>waving</b> to the crowd in celebration and stalled his engine. Ironically this handed Nelson Piquet his 23rd and last F1 race win. Despite a good mid-season, which included a hat-trick of victories, Senna's consistency (and Mansell's retirements at key races) meant that he finished second in the Championship for the third time in his career, this time behind Senna.|$|E
25|$|Francis M. Walker's men, which {{included}} his 19th Tennessee Infantry {{as well as}} Maney's old brigade, had not been engaged that day since they had been marched and countermarched almost back to their original position. Cleburne placed Walker's brigade on the left front of the attacking force. The attack was launched with about 3,500 men in total, with 2,000 more in a second wave, at about 6:00p.m. Cleburne himself led the attack with Walker's brigade. The Union force had about half {{the number of men}} but they were behind their defenses. Emerging from a stand of woods, Walker's men were hard hit and began to retreat before Cleburne and Maney rallied them. Then they moved with a two-sided assault with troops to their right toward the Union line. Despite taking about 100 casualties in their previous advances, Walker's men followed Walker, who <b>was</b> <b>waving</b> his sword in encouragement, toward the crest of the hill. As they reached the crest, Walker's brigade was hit with a tremendous volley from defenders over the crest. Walker was killed by that volley. He had been appointed a brigadier general the previous day but he had not yet received written notification of his appointment. Walker's commission arrived at his headquarters the day after he was killed. After Walker's death, many of his men diverted to another point of attack to try to take a Union battery and suffered severe casualties. As night fell, the Confederates could not continue the attack and the Union troops held their fort {{at the top of the}} hill. The Confederates had sustained over 600 casualties while the Union defenders had endured about 550 casualties in the Battle of Bald Hill, which was but a small part of the overall Battle of Atlanta.|$|E
500|$|Before a 1994 {{playoff game}} against the Steelers' long-time rival Cleveland Browns, Steelers {{defensive}} tackle Brentson Buckner accidentally dropped a Towel that he <b>was</b> <b>waving</b> during the player introductions. Browns running back Earnest Byner stepped on the Towel yelling, [...] "We don't care about your towel. We're going to beat you this time." [...] This act [...] "provok other Steelers and Browns to mingle. Not affectionately." [...] The Steelers won the game 299.|$|E

50|$|Cale Yarborough {{managed to}} defeat David Pearson by eight seconds {{in front of}} an {{audience}} of 40,000 people. Two cautions (for 14 laps) and 41 different lead changes made the race two hours and twenty-nine minutes long. The green flag <b>was</b> <b>waved</b> at 10:00 A.M. and the checkered flag <b>was</b> <b>waved</b> at approximately 12:29 P.M.|$|R
500|$|When Madison {{discovered}} that Winchester <b>was</b> <b>waving</b> the flag, he refused {{the order to}} surrender on grounds that, as a prisoner, Winchester had no authority to issue it. Proctor demanded Madison's unconditional surrender, but Madison insisted that the terms of surrender include Proctor's protection of the American prisoners from the Indian allies of the British. Proctor initially balked at anything but an unconditional surrender, but after Madison's promise that the Americans would [...] "sell their lives as dearly as possible", Proctor acquiesced.|$|E
500|$|The {{first four}} rounds were {{relatively}} close, with Gomez leading according to pundits, but the fight {{ended in the}} fifth round under bizarre circumstances when {{for no apparent reason}} Gomez stopped fighting and failed to defend himself. He then received a number of unanswered punches from McDonagh before being floored. Gomez rose from the canvas immediately but appeared to ignore the referee and walk towards his corner while the referee continued with his count. [...] Gomez then left the ring as the referee <b>was</b> <b>waving</b> the fight off. RTÉ commentator Steve Collins said [...] "I smell a rat, something's not right here." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1951, Bouchard was {{involved}} in a legal first when he was a defendant in a lawsuit brought by a New York Rangers fan. The fan claimed Bouchard had struck him with his stick when he <b>was</b> <b>waving</b> to a friend watching the game on TV. Bouchard said the fan had actually raised his fist towards a fellow Canadiens player who was being taken off the ice with an injury and his stick hit the fan accidentally as he tried to ward off the blow. In what may have been the first time in legal history, evidence was taken during a trial from someone witnessing an event on a television as the fan's friend testified he'd seen Bouchard strike the blow. Bouchard won the case when Otis Guernsey, president of Abercrombie and Fitch, who was at the game testified he heard [...] "vile language" [...] and saw the fan raise his fist and not wave.|$|E

2500|$|Elang Mulia Lesmana (5 July 1978 – 12 May 1998) was {{a student}} at the Faculty of Architecture.

2500|$|Sometime {{after the}} battle the Sioux warriors rode into camps. [...] "One {{of the men in}} advance <b>was</b> <b>waving</b> a scalp. This caused great excitement. The men paraded around the village ... Everybody {{appeared}} to be happy and rejoicing". Later well-known Sioux Indian Luther Standing Bear got the impression that [...] "about three hundred Pawnees were killed". Eastes reported one Sioux killed and some badly wounded. The Cut-off Oglalas had suffered no casualties at all, according to their sub-agent. This is at odds with narratives of what happened in the canyon that day.|$|E
2500|$|When Walcott {{got back}} to Liston {{and looked at the}} {{knockdown}} timekeeper, Francis McDonough, to pick up the count, Liston had fallen back on the canvas. Walcott never did pick up the count. He said he could not hear McDonough, who did not have a microphone. Also, McDonough did not bang on the canvas or motion a number count with his fingers. McDonough, however, claimed Walcott was looking at the crowd and never at him. After Liston arose, Walcott wiped off his gloves. He then left the fighters to go over to McDonough. [...] "The timekeeper <b>was</b> <b>waving</b> both hands and saying, 'I counted him out—the fight is over,'" [...] Walcott said after the fight. [...] "Nat Fleischer [...] was sitting beside McDonough and he <b>was</b> <b>waving</b> his hands, too, saying it was over." [...] Walcott then rushed back to the fighters, who had resumed boxing, and stopped the fight—awarding Ali a first-round knockout victory. [...] Strict interpretation of the knockdown/count rule states it is the referee's count and not the timekeeper's that is the official count. [...] Furthermore, that count cannot be started until the fighter scoring the knockdown goes to and remains in a neutral corner. [...] Ali did neither. [...] Walcott never began a count in the ring because of Ali's non-compliance and his physical struggle with getting Ali to go to that neutral corner. [...] The interference of ringside reporters regarding interpretation of the rules, the fight stoppage and the controversy after the fight had not been seen since the Long Count Fight between Champion Gene Tunney and challenger Jack Dempsey in 1927.|$|E
