5|$|Nickelodeon Movies {{purchased}} the film rights to Daniel Handler's book series in 2000 and soon began {{development of a}} film <b>with</b> <b>Barry</b> Sonnenfeld attached to direct.

Robert Gordon rewrote Handler's script, and principal photography started in November 2003.

5|$|On 12 March 2016, Costa {{received}} his first red card in a Chelsea shirt {{near the end}} their 2–0 FA Cup quarter-final defeat to Everton for confronting opponent Gareth Barry. Footage appeared to show Costa biting Barry during that confrontation after clashing heads. Earlier in the match, Costa appeared to spit {{in the direction of}} the referee after he was yellow carded for a clash <b>with</b> <b>Barry.</b> Later, both Costa and Barry denied that the bite occurred. Costa's two-match ban was extended to three, and he was fined £20,000. On 2 May, as Chelsea drew 2–2 against Tottenham to deny them the title, Costa was gouged in the eyes by Mousa Dembélé during a mass brawl; the Belgian received a retrospective six-match ban.|$|E
5|$|Round the Horne ran to four series, {{broadcast}} in successive years, and finished in June 1968. Three {{weeks after the}} fourth series finished, the first episode of Horne A'Plenty was broadcast on ITV. In a sketch show format, and <b>with</b> <b>Barry</b> Took as script editor (and later producer), this {{was an attempt to}} translate the spirit of Round the Horne to television, although with different actors supporting Horne: Graham Stark, for example, substituted for Kenneth Williams and Sheila Steafel for Betty Marsden. The first six-part series ran from 22 June to 27 July 1968, the second (by which time ABC had become Thames Television) from 27 November to 1 January 1969.|$|E
5|$|Valentine {{initially}} works <b>with</b> <b>Barry</b> Burton, another Alpha team member, as they {{inspect the}} mansion and battle its undead residents. Valentine and Chris Redfield eventually {{discover that the}} mansion houses the Umbrella Corporation's Arklay Research Facility biological warfare site, where the deadly T-virus is being developed, and that STARS commander Captain Albert Wesker is a double agent for the Umbrella Corporation. Of the possible game endings, in series canon Valentine kills a supersoldier released by Wesker and escapes the self-destructing mansion with the STARS squad. As {{a result of these}} experiences, Valentine forms a strong friendship with Redfield and becomes a passionate opponent of bioterrorism. Disillusioned with the RCPD's failure to take action against Umbrella, she leaves the police service but remains in Raccoon City to investigate Umbrella.|$|E
