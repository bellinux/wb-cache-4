5|$|Woodward’s own {{judgment}} {{of the war and}} of Bush doesn’t really matter. In the course of four books he has given readers the conversations and documents <b>we</b> <b>need</b> to reach our {{own judgment}}s. He has also, however unevenly and imperfectly, supplied enough synthesis and analysis to make that judgment genuinely informed. Sure, these books can be a slog. But they stand as the fullest story yet of the Bush presidency and of the war that is likely to be its most important legacy.|$|E

5000|$|Eisenhower {{appointed}} his friend, {{retired general}} Lucius Clay, {{to lead a}} presidential commission to study highway design proposals. In January 1955 they recommended a 10-year construction program costing $101 billion to build 41,000 miles of divided highways that would link all medium and major cities. Clay talked Eisenhower out of using toll roads. After compromising with Democrats in 1956, the system was financed by a trust fund based on gasoline taxes of four cents a gallon and taxes on tires. The Federal share of the funding was 90%; the states built, owned and maintained the highways. Clay stated: It was evident <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> better highways. <b>We</b> <b>needed</b> them for safety, to accommodate more automobiles. <b>We</b> <b>needed</b> them for defense purposes, if that should ever be necessary. And <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> them for the economy. Not just as a public works measure, but for future growth.|$|R
