I would chew a piece of gum at school, and the nun would say, 'Jesus is very angry <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> that,' and on the wall behind her would be a dying, {{bleeding}} guy on a cross. That's a horrifying image to throw at a little kid. You really could almost think that your talking in line, say, was on a par with killing Jesus." ...|$|E

He concluded, [...] "while I do not accept the Darwinian theory I shall not quarrel <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] Evoking the design argument, he said, [...] "I have a right to assume, and I prefer to assume, a Designer back of the design— a Creator back of the creation."

"Why, then," [...] says William, [...] "I {{have but}} one thing more to article <b>with</b> <b>thee</b> <b>about,</b> and that is, that thou wilt consent that if thou dost not approve of it for thyself, thou wilt yet consent that I shall put {{so much of it}} in {{practice}} as relates to myself and my new comrade doctor, so that it be nothing to thy detriment and loss." ...|$|R

2500|$|During {{his studies}} in the USSR, Elbegdorj learned about Glasnost, the {{concepts}} such as {{freedom of speech and}} economic liberties. After returning to Mongolia, he met other like-minded people and tried to present those ideas to a wider audience, despite attempts of repression from the Politburo-authority of the government, and threats by his employer to lose his job. At the end of a speech at the Young Artists' Second National Congress on 28 November 1989, Elbegdorj said that Mongolia needed democracy and appealed to youth to collaborate to create democracy in Mongolia. He told the audience [...] "We consider that Perestroika is a timely and brave step. Youth's contribution to this revolutionary matter is not by supportive talks but by certain work. Our contribution is our objectives to be fulfilled. Our objectives are:... following democracy and transparency and contributing to glasnost,... and supporting fair progressive power... These are the objectives of an initiatives' group-an organization that shall work. After the congress I hope we will gather and discuss <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it in this (newly forming group). The organization shall be based on public, voluntary and democratic principles." ...|$|E
2500|$|The United States treaty negotiators had overtly {{misrepresented}} {{the purpose}} and effect of the proposed treaty as merely conveying a [...] "right of passage" [...] over the Ojibwe lands to the United States. [...] The United States intention to bring in settlers {{as well as the}} railroad had been an established policy for years, as was plainly stated in newspapers and governmental reports of the time. [...] Governor Ramsey's journal of the treaty negotiations contained his speech to the assembled Ojibwe in which he, as a trained lawyer and experienced politician and Indian negotiator, directly misrepresented {{the purpose and}} intent of the treaty: Now, there is growing up a trade of considerable importance between the British settlements on the north and the American settlements on the south. ... Now, this is a trade which cannot and must not be interrupted. [...] And their Great Father, feeling this, and desirous to prevent any trouble between his white and red people, has sent us here to come to some understanding <b>with</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it. [...] Their Great Father has no especial desire to get possession of their lands. [...] He does not want their lands at all if {{they do not want to}} part with them. [...] He has more land now than he knows what to do with. [...] He simply wishes that his people should enjoy the privilege of traveling through their country on steamboats and wagons unmolested Even after the initial proposal for a mere right of way was rejected, he was representing that if they sold their land, the Ojibwe could still occupy it and hunt on it for a long time.|$|E
