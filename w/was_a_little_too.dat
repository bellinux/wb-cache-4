But Iowa State's Seneca Wallace {{was not about to}} leave Iowa City with a loss. Coupled with two Banks fumbles in Iowa territory, a stellar performance by the senior quarterback led to 29 straight Iowa State points. Despite holding Iowa State to 85 yards rushing, Iowa's last touchdown <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> late, and the Cyclones ran out the clock after Iowa failed an onside kick attempt.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the start}} of his MMA career, people had been advising Bisping that he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> small for light heavyweight and would do better at middleweight. With the support of UFC {{president}} Dana White, Bisping then decided to drop down a weight division, following his loss to Evans. On 19 April 2008 at UFC 83, Bisping made his middleweight debut against Charles McCarthy. Bisping won by TKO, as McCarthy was unable to continue after the first round due to a forearm injury he sustained after receiving an unanswered series of knees and uppercuts from Bisping.|$|E
25|$|I {{grew up on}} the Jersey Shore, on {{a little}} barrier island. The Atlantic Ocean was on one side, the bay was on the other. Everyone there hunted and fished and clammed and got crabs out of the bay. And one day my brother told me someone had come down from the Bureau of Petty Harassment or {{something}} and they measured the temperature of the water and had decided it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> warm and a certain type of bacteria might incubate in it and there was a chance that might harm the clams. And so, from now on, no one was supposed to take clams out of the bay anymore. Which everyone ignored. And no one died. That was before the government got tenacious about this stuff. So I thought that was pretty stupid right there.|$|E

25|$|Head first {{showed his}} talent for {{teaching}} {{at the age of}} 21 when he addressed the Stoke Newington Mutual Instruction Society at the Friends Meeting House, Park Street, on the fertilization of plants. Professor H. M. Turnbull writes of Head's devotion to teaching:I had the good fortune when first going to the hospital to meet daily in the mornings on the steam engine underground railway Dr. Henry Head. He told me to buy Gee's little book on percussion, and kindly taught me throughout our journeys about physical signs, much to the annoyance of our fellow travellers; indeed in his characteristic keenness he spoke so loudly that as we walked to the hospital from St. Mary's station {{people on the other side}} of the wide Whitechapel Road would turn to look at us. I was greatly interested in the central nervous system when learning physiology and anatomy, and so I enjoyed greatly my three months as a clerk to him, his sessions in the out-patient department, and his wonderful demonstrations on clinical evenings.... He devoted a great deal of time to teaching. In his rounds of the wards his clerks read the histories and examinations they had written, and he criticized even the English. He did not confine himself to nervous diseases, but took more pains than any other physician for whom I clerked to teach us physical signs and – how to examine patients of all kinds. He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> anxious to get exactly correct results when demonstrating to students; thus when he was mapping out areas of anaesthesia or hyperaesthesia the cottonwool, pin, etc., would pass more slowly, and the 'say when' would become a little more rapid and insistent, as the correct boundary was approached.|$|E

As a caisson descended, the chain coiled up at the bottom of the lift. The small amount of energy was created by ensuring that the ascending caisson <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> low by the time the descending one reached the bottom.

500|$|Reviews of {{the plot}} were {{generally}} positive. Mike Hale of The New York Times described the episode as [...] "taut, restrained and well acted", as well as [...] "interesting for its extremely close tracking of the Strauss-Kahn case," [...] and felt that the verdict was [...] "disappointing in dramatic terms but understandable." [...] TVfanatic.com gave the episode a 3.5/5 rating, calling the episode [...] "your typical SVU fare", but felt that the episode was missing its typical argument {{between two of the}} detectives, as they [...] "provided their own perspectives on the issue and they usually represent the division in the show's audience's members."

500|$|Lost Horizons {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics, although several critics critiqued the album's near-constant mellowness.

[...] A reviewer for Entertainment.ie praised the band for approaching electronica {{from a new}} angle, writing, [...] "this London-based duo employ Playschool pianos, acoustic guitars and sprightly beats to create laid-back instrumentals guaranteed to soothe even the most restless of souls. [...] What really marks Lemon Jelly as exciting new talents is their quirky sense of humour, which they use to brighten up their sound with skilful use of nursery rhymes, brass bands and offbeat samples. Pascal Wyse of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Everything is approachable and purely crafted, but Lost Horizons cheats banality with some choice quirks: Magnificent Seven strings, astronauts chatting, panoramic sound effects." [...] Chris Dahlen of Pitchfork felt that the album <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> saccharine at times, {{but that it is}} [...] "the perfect disc to throw on after your four-disc Ultrachill Dub Groove Mix has put the whole party to sleep.

[...] Roger Ebert, reviewing the movie in the Chicago Sun-Times, noted that it ended with a better conclusion when Stone had edited the film after its Cannes viewing, but still felt it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> long. He considered the film to be sophisticated and said its photography was aesthetically pleasing but stated he wanted it to be [...] "outraged." [...] In The Guardian Peter Bradshaw gave the film two out of five stars, commenting that [...] "despite the pious waffle about market craziness being like cancer, no one is ever shown enduring the actual misery of losing money." [...] Writing for Time magazine, Richard Corliss stated that the film has the [...] "drive, luxe and sarcastic wit of the snazziest Hollywood movies."

Jeffery particularly praised the build-up to Amy and Rory's departure as well as the [...] "superb production design". Dave Golder of SFX awarded the episode four out of five stars, believing that the [...] "bittersweet exit" [...] of the Ponds distracted the viewer from various narrative problems, such as the Statue of Liberty. He felt that Gillan and Darvill [...] "were on top form" [...] as well as Smith's [...] "brilliant performance" [...] and a [...] "less over-the-top River", and also wrote positively about the noir theme and the Angels using the Winter Quay as a battery farm. The Huffington Post writer Maureen Ryan was more critical of the episode, worrying that the BBC's international promotion of the show was {{to the detriment of the}} quality of the writing. She felt that Amy deserved a better exit and [...] "was crowded out by the distracting presence of River Song and by the fact that Rory was the one to make the essential choices first". She also personally disliked the [...] "timey-wimey" [...] devices, and commented that the [...] "big and operatic tone the director was clearly going for clashed with the mood of film noir" [...] and that the Angels [...] "felt less menacing" [...] and the [...] "pace <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> frantic".|$|E
500|$|The next {{race was}} the Breeders' Cup Classic on November 1. Because many leading older horses retired in 2014, {{most of the}} main contenders for the 2014 Classic were the three year olds: in {{addition}} to California Chrome, former foes Bayern, Candy Boy and Tonalist entered. His chief rival {{was considered to be}} the then-undefeated American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt, Shared Belief, a gelding who missed the Triple Crown series due to hoof problems; the two had never faced each other. California Chrome was 4-1 on the morning line, second favorite to Shared Belief. In the race, Bayern bumped into Shared Belief at the start, then took the lead {{for the duration of the}} race. California Chrome was clear of traffic, maintained third place for most of the race, was closing at the end, and finished a very close third, only a neck behind winner Bayern, who won by a nose over second-place finisher Toast of New York. Shared Belief was fourth. Post race analysis noted that California Chrome stayed on the outside throughout the race, and actually ran 44 feet farther than the winner. [...] Sherman spoke in positive terms of the horse's finish, stating, [...] "My horse ran his eyeballs out. He was right there, right down to the money. I thought it was a great effort. He came back strong." [...] Espinoza was less enthusiastic: [...] "On the backstretch I thought I had a chance to win... The last sixteenth [...] was digging as hard as he could, but getting just a little tired. I wish he had one more race. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> much for him today."

500|$|Throughout {{his career}} Monteux {{suffered}} from being {{thought of as}} a specialist in French music. The music that meant most to him was that of German composers, particularly Brahms, but this was often overlooked by concert promoters and recording companies. Of the four Brahms symphonies, he was invited by the recording companies to record only one, the Second. Recordings of his live performances of the First and Third have been released on CD, but the discography in Canarina's biography lists no recording, live or from the studio, of the Fourth. The critic William Mann, along with many others, regarded him as a [...] "supremely authoritative" [...] conductor of Brahms, though Cardus disagreed: [...] "In German music Monteux, naturally enough, missed harmonic weight and the right heavily lunged tempo. His rhythm, for example, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>too</b> pointed for, say, Brahms or Schumann." [...] Gramophones reviewer Jonathan Swain contends that no conductor knew more than Monteux about expressive possibilities in the strings, claiming that [...] "the conductor who doesn't play a stringed instrument simply doesn't know how to get the different sounds; and the bow has such importance in string playing that there are maybe 50 different ways of producing the same note"; In his 2003 biography, John Canarina lists nineteen [...] "significant world premieres" [...] conducted by Monteux. In addition to Petrushka and The Rite of Spring is a further Stravinsky work, The Nightingale. Monteux's other premieres for Diaghilev included Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé and Debussy's Jeux. In the concert hall he premiered works by, among others, Milhaud, Poulenc and Prokofiev. In a letter of April 1914 Stravinsky wrote [...] "everyone can appreciate your zeal and your probity in regard to the contemporary works of various tendencies that you have had occasion to defend." ...|$|E
