60|$|With speech {{humanity}} begins. With {{the dawn}} of speech the child ceases to be an animal we cherish, and crosses the boundary into distinctly human intercourse. There begins in its mind {{the development of the}} most wonderful of all conceivable apparatus, a subtle and intricate keyboard, that will end at last with thirty or forty or fifty thousand keys. This queer, staring, soft little being in its mother's arms is organizing something within itself, beside which the most wonderful orchestra one can imagine is a lump of rude clumsiness. There will come a time when, at the merest touch upon those keys, image will follow image and emotion develop into emotion, when the whole creation, the deeps of space, the minutest beauties of the microscope, cities, armies, passions, splendours, sorrows, will leap out of darkness into the conscious being of thought, when this interwoven net of brief, small sounds will form the centre of a web that will hold together in its threads the universe, the All, visible and invisible, material and immaterial, real and imagined, of a human mind. And if we are {{to make the best of}} a child, it is in no way secondary to its physical health and growth that it should acquire a great and thorough command over speech, not merely that it should speak, but, what is far more vital, that it should understand swiftly and subtly things written and said.

40|$|Abstract: If {{you think}} that there are {{concrete}} particulars and that concrete particulars have a complex constitution, you must solve (or dissolve) the Bradleyan problem of the One in Many. There are basically two ways to do this. You may, pace Bradley, claim that the constituents of the concrete particular are, by their nature, such that they must be related. The price to pay for such a move is, however, (too) high. Only if a deep-seated intuition – DISTINCTION – is rejected, can it succeed. But you need not choose between solving the Bradleyan problem and retaining a plausible intuition. You can have your cake and eat it too. All {{you need to do is}} reconsider the different ways in which a relation may stand to its relata. Again pace Bradley, you may then posit relations which stand in the ‘right ’ kind of dependence-relations to their relata, and you will, as a result, have added something to the mix able to turn what are many distinct constituents into one thing, without either contradiction, nonsense or vicious infinite regress. As it turns out, however, the only kind of relational entities for which <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> result are trope-relations. This is why there are tropes. Meet Sam.

Of course, many other variables considered not important are omitted in this identity. A firm will determine the values of its endogenous variables so as to maximize its gain Λ, being subject to the relation (1). Our hypothesis on the gain function is as follows, (2) [numerical formula] A firm will determine the values of its endogenous variables so as to maximize its gain Λ, being subject to the relation (1). Our hypothesis on the gain function is as follows, (2) A = n-￡l, where II stands for the present values of "gross" profit which is expected to be gained from (money) capital invested during one unit of time (the term "gross" is used here to show that this profit contains interest cost) and Ω represents the appraised money term value of psychological resistance which the firm may feel when employing that amount of capital during one unit of time. II can be divided into two kinds of gross profit, profit from the capital invested into the productive operation, II_ 1 and profit from the capital invested into the capital assets, II_ 2. If we show explicitly the endogenous variables which are considered to influence II_ 1, II_ 2 and Ω, (3) [numerical formula] where Y_ 1,,Y_m are the debt balances of various types of funds (including capital stock) Therefore [numerical formula] Here μ and v denote the average time lengthes for whithdrawal of money expensed in the forms of C and I respectively.

The conditional equations for equilibrium in which Λ is maximized subject to (1) are (4) [numerical formula] If a firm behaves according to the gain maximization hypothesis defined above, (4) must hold at any periods. So if any one expression of these equations (4) is known in its value, it means that the values of the other expressions are known at the same time. In this sense, let us examine the value of[numerical formula] If we neglect general administrative expense, distribution cost and corporation tax,[numerical formula] becomes (5) where y^^～_ is sale-proceeds which the firm expects to obtain expending the current cost C, X the physical quantity of sales, P its price, q the physical quantity of inputs and s its price. The marginal productivity (dX) /(dq) can be calculated from "operating production function," which is the technological relation between output X and input q operating: the given equipment. In this paper we adopted two alternative methods in order to get the value s/P・(dq) /(dX). One way is to take the slope of the line connecting: two points, namely, the point (C_t, y^^～_ and the point (C_,y^^～_), in the space of (C,. y^^～_) as the approximate value of s/P・(dq) /(dX). But in this case price change must be taken into account (the change of capital equipments was assumed to be negligible). This price modification was done by the following formula. (6) [numerical formula] The other method is to estimate the operating production functions directly. Generally speaking, they can not be estimated without data of the capital assets, the measurement of which is notoriously difficult. Fortunately the data of productive capacity are available in the iron and steel industry, and we assume that the productive capacity Q is this output level corresponding to the operating degree which produces the maximum value of q/X. We specified the operating production function by and using the above assumption about the productive capacity we could estimate the values of two parameters α and β at each period of each firm. (dq) /(dX) is given by αβ・sinβq. Then, using the values of [numerical formula] estimated by the atove procedures, we sought the factors affecting v/μ・(dI) /(dII_ 2) and μ・(θY_i) /(θΩ) (i== 1, ・・・・・・, m) by the regression analysis. In other words, we tried to estimate the shape of the marginal gross profit schedule of investment-and of the marginal fund resistance schedules. They are the partial derivative functions of Λ. All of these estimations were carried out by time series analysis for each firm fin Japanese iron and steel industry. The results of these regression analyses can not be stated here because of limited space...|$|E
40|$|The {{digital era}} {{in which we are}} living today {{requires}} our increasing awareness of energy efficiency to reduce the negative effects on our lovely environment. We, people, are increasingly dealing with digital contents to facilitate our deals, which increases the demand for larger storage capacities than ever before. The environmental considerations and the data explosion worldwide are calling for green and ultrahigh-density storage technologies. A storage technology, based on MEMS, promises to deliver green and high-capacity storage systems. Storage densities up to 4 Tb $in^ 2 $ have already been demonstrated. With such a technology, a storage device with a capacity of 1 Tb can be mounted in a package smaller than a thumbnail, dissipating one Watt of power. Disruptive technologies take, however, a significant amount of time to materialize into commercial products. One key reason for this delay is the difficulty of integrating and adopting new technologies. Integration, in a broad sense, involves the investigation of roles a new technology can play, and solutions to its impediments. Early solutions to the integration problem help to reduce the time to market, and most likely contribute {{to the success of the}} technology. Flash memory, for instance, was invented in the eighties. The large demand for Flash in mobile systems has drawn the attention of researchers to investigate Flash. Just recently, researchers started looking into ways to construct storage systems based on Flash that are reliable, have low latency, and consume little energy. Flash memory has not found its way to enterprise storage yet, whereas their kin, hard disk drives, are sitting there wasting a significant amount of energy. That kind of late response to Flash is costing data centers millions of dollars every day in energy and cooling cost. We would like to avoid such a late response for MEMS-based storage devices by being proactive in how <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> family of devices successfully integrated as early as possible. Like any other technology, MEMS-based storage demands optimization, and has challenges that need to be tackled. In this work, we optimize MEMS-based storage, tailor it to mobile battery-powered systems, and compare it to Flash memory and Hybrid (Disk [...] Flash) storage. The research of this dissertation looks mainly into the energy and cost aspects of MEMS-based storage with the following two contributions. We devise policies to reduce the energy consumption of MEMS-based storage devices. We also propose to exploit knowledge of the expected workload in configuring the data layout of a MEMS-based storage device in order to increase the effective capacity. Both contributions target at satisfying the increasing demand for green and inexpensive storage devices. In addition to the energy and cost aspects, we make sure that the response time and the lifetime of MEMS-based storage devices are competitive. The data-layout and energy-saving policies account for the timing performance by looking at configurations that do not compromise on the response time. With respect to lifetime, we devise probe wear-leveling policies that increase the lifetime of MEMS-based storage devices with minimal influence on the energy consumption and the response time. The dissertation incorporates the conclusions from the study of the policies, and investigates the employment of MEMS-based storage devices in important types of mobile application. For predominately streaming applications, we also investigate the influence of buffering on the energy consumption, response time, and capacity of MEMS-based storage devices. We put the technology into perspective by comparing it to Flash memory and Hybrid (Disk [...] Flash) storage. Our system-level research in this dissertation identifies potential points of enhancement of MEMS-based storage devices. Enhancements are targeted at reducing the energy consumption, decreasing the response time, cutting down the per-bit cost, and increasing the lifetime of the device. Most importantly, we show that the per-bit cost of MEMS-based storage is crucial to its success. Our system-level contributes to reduce the cost, while reduction on the device level is still needed. We provide methods and means to configure MEMS-based storage devices to prepare them to serve in different environments as a viable storage technology. Following our research findings, designers can craft storage systems based on MEMS-based storage that are reliable, energy and performance efficient, and cost effective...|$|E
40|$|WILLIAMSBURG [...] The College of William and Mary {{should make}} {{temporary}} plans about its law school space problems {{because it is}} doubtful that the next General Assembly session will appropriate the nearly 5. 6 million necessary to construct a building next year. That was the suggestion State Sen. Edward E. Willey, D-Richmond, chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, said he would make to Dr. Thomas A. Graves Jr., William and Mary president. Willey said that while he 2 ̆ 2 is committed to support a new law school building at William and Mary... {{it is doubtful that}} there will be any funds available next year 2 ̆ 2 in spite of warning from the American Bar Association that the college could lose its law school accreditation because of its poor facilities. In a letter to William and Mary, made public by college officials last month, the ABA said that the Marshall-Wythe School of Law building is 2 ̆ 2 the most inadequate physical plant of any ABA-approved law school in the country. 2 ̆ 2 Willey was on vacation when the letter was released and returned to Richmond only late last week. He said he had not seen any of the letters or read Graves 2 ̆ 7 statement about the ABA ultimatum. However, Willey expressed concern that William and Mary, like other state agencies, is requesting and 2 ̆ 2 making threats 2 ̆ 2 for funds, yet does not offer any suggestions as to where additional money will come from. 2 ̆ 2 I know what Tom Graves wants, 2 ̆ 2 Willey said. 2 ̆ 2 He wants a new law school building but {{a lot of other people}} want something, too. 2 ̆ 2 Willey said he does not consider the release of the ABA report to the press to be an attempt to blackmail the state of Virginia. 2 ̆ 2 But you ask Tom Graves where we 2 ̆ 7 re going to get the money. The Medical College of Virginia has tried the same thing. They say their accreditation is threatened because of their hospital facilities. 2 ̆ 2 Sure I want the best medical school and the best law school we can have, but we 2 ̆ 7 ve got money problems now. You tell Tom Graves that he should make some kind of recommendation of where <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>this</b> money, but not to tell the General Assembly how to spend the money. 2 ̆ 2 Willey said, 2 ̆ 2 my suggestion to him is that he 2 ̆ 7 d better start shuffling [rooms] down there. 2 ̆ 2 He indicated that reports to the State Council of Higher Education noted that there is 2 ̆ 2 a lot of excess space down there, a lot of wasted space. 2 ̆ 2 It seems like to me that he 2 ̆ 7 d better look around for a new and temporary plan for the near future, 2 ̆ 2 Willey said. Willey indicated that it could be several more years before money would be available to construct the new law school building. There is planning money out now for about 200 million in capital outlay projects, Willey said, and 2 ̆ 2 we 2 ̆ 7 re getting pressure from all over the state. The University of Virginia is just as intent as William and Mary about the construction of a new Alderman Library, 2 ̆ 2 Willey emphasized. 2 ̆ 2 Is what they 2 ̆ 7 re asking for not just as important as what William and Mary wants? 2 ̆ 2 Willey said that neither he nor any other state government official 2 ̆ 2 can go out and promise one project; you 2 ̆ 7 ve got to look at the total picture, at the other needs around the state and then at the projected revenue. And finally, you have to look and see what comes first... 2 ̆ 2 Willey, who has actively supported the William and Mary law school on several occasions in appropriation bills as well as attacking it when it attempted to hire black lawyer Saad el-Amin (Jeroyd X Greene) to its faculty last year, said strongly, 2 ̆ 2 There is a reality about all of this and I 2 ̆ 7 m not going to let Tom Graves or anybody else threaten me. 2 ̆ 2 One of the main items of concern to Willey, however, was not Graves 2 ̆ 7 request to the governor 2 ̆ 2 that every effort be made at the 1976 General Assembly to provide both capital outlay and maintenance and operating funds... to allow America 2 ̆ 7 s oldest law school to overcome this severe crisis, 2 ̆ 2 but that the ABA had pressed the college at this time of economic downspin. 2 ̆ 2 I don 2 ̆ 7 t know of any accrediting board in the country that is so tough as not to realize the facts of life, 2 ̆ 2 Willey said. Apparently William and Mary is not the only school where the ABA is moving to challenge law school accreditations. Several academicians and college officials in Virginia and several other states, including South Carolina, have said they have heard the same thing among legal circles. Problems are not new to the law school, but in many respects the building question is largely out of the college 2 ̆ 7 s hands at this stage. Several faculty members, however, have been critical recently of the college administration for not foreseeing the economic problems and for failing to have a strong alternative. They believe the administration has dragged its feet in an effort to construct the new facilities. (The college proposed an alternative plan several years ago.) It would have converted old Rogers Hall into a second law building. But this work also would cost some money [...] estimated at more than 500, 000. Some law school alumni have also noted that when the present facility was opened in 1967, it was just a 2 ̆ 2 temporary facility. 2 ̆ 2 They are now asking why planning on the new building did not take public shape until 1972. Gov. Linwood Holton urged the 1974 assembly to include total financing for the law school building in his budget message just a few days before he left office. The request, however, was made at a time of diminishing funds and the legislature reduced the item to planning money. College officials hoped then that the building could begin in 1976 with funding in the 1976 - 1978 biennium budget. Then the state and national economy took a tailspin and state revenue began to fall off by the millions of dollars and the state budget was cut several times by the governor. Hopes for the law building also began to fade.
