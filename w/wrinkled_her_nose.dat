60|$|Mrs. Bellew {{had passed}} {{so close that}} the skirt of her seagreen dress brushed their feet with a swish, and a scent as of a flower-bed was wafted from it. Mrs. Pendyce <b>wrinkled</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "No! What a pity! Such {{a pretty}} pocket. Well, I think I've got {{some things in}} mine {{that will make a}} pretty jingle in it. Yes! I declare I've got five little round silver things, and hear what a pretty noise they make in Totty's pink pocket." [...] Here he shook the pocket with the five sixpences in it, and Totty showed her teeth and <b>wrinkled</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> in great glee; but, {{divining}} that there was nothing more to be got by staying, she jumped off the shelf and ran away to jingle her pocket in the hearing of Nancy, while her mother called after her, [...] "Oh for shame, you naughty gell! Not to thank the captain for what he's given you I'm sure, sir, it's very kind of you; but she's spoiled shameful; her father won't have her said nay in anything, and there's no managing her. It's being the youngest, and th' only gell." ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Naylor stared, <b>wrinkling</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose,</b> {{and holding}} the {{scissors}} wide apart....|$|R
60|$|Taking out his pouch, {{he rolled}} a cigarette. The white young man bent his dull wink on Thyme, who, <b>wrinkling</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose,</b> was {{pretending to be}} far away.|$|R
2500|$|June {{is thrilled}} when her sons {{are invited to}} cotillions and {{birthday}} parties but <b>wrinkles</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> with disgust when they bring home wriggling earthworms or rain-soaked clothing. She was described by {{her husband in the}} series as a [...] "former belle of East St. Louis." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Pendyce {{leaned back}} in her chair smiling, and <b>wrinkling</b> <b>her</b> fine, thin <b>nose.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must have}} money," [...] said Miss Lydia, {{with a little}} <b>wrinkle</b> above <b>her</b> <b>nose.</b> [...] "Give me the two dollars, and I will {{telegraph}} to Uncle Ralph for some to-night." ...|$|R
5000|$|Zelda {{especially}} irritated Dobie by <b>wrinkling</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> at him. He always wrinkled back; {{he claimed}} it was a reflex action (often admonishing her [...] "Now cut that out!"), while she took it as proof that he loved her but didn't realize it yet. Zelda assured Dobie that he would eventually come to realize his love for her through the influence of [...] "propinquity": because he was Gillis and she was Gilroy, they were {{always going to be}} seated together through high school and college and would eventually fall in love.|$|R
6000|$|... "Her room's {{much the}} best in the house; it's airy, and it looks out over someone's garden. I suppose she stays there because it's so cheap. The Hughs' rooms are---" [...] She stopped, <b>wrinkling</b> <b>her</b> {{straight}} <b>nose.</b>|$|R
60|$|Suddenly the Patchwork Girl laughed. It {{was funny}} {{to see her}} laugh, because <b>her</b> cheeks <b>wrinkled</b> up, <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> tipped, <b>her</b> silver button eyes twinkled and her mouth curled at the corners in a comical way.|$|R
5000|$|The {{news anchor}} would {{interrupt}} Litella {{to point out}} her error, along the lines, [...] "Thats death penalty, Ms. Litella, not deaf ... death." [...] Litella would <b>wrinkle</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose,</b> say, [...] "Oh, thats very different...." [...] then meekly turn to the camera and say, [...] "Never mind." [...] When Litella played against news anchor Chevy Chase (whom she often called [...] "Cheddar Cheese"), he would be somewhat sympathetic to her. But when Jane Curtin took over the anchor role, she would scold Litella, [...] "Every week you come on and you get it wrong," [...] to which Litella would reply, [...] "Bitch!" ...|$|R
40|$|Madame Marquet chatted gaily to {{the little}} {{squirrel}} that sat watching her from the porch steps while she waited for her neighbor {{to come to the}} door. 2 ̆ 2 Caesar, you 2 ̆ 7 re a leel rascal, that 2 ̆ 7 s w ha t, 2 ̆ 2 she teased softly, 2 ̆ 2 but if you come over after while, Mama will geeve you something to eat. 2 ̆ 2 The squirrel cocked {{his head to one side}} as though he were puzzled by her French flavored language; then he scampered quickly away as the front door opened. Madame Marquet giggled at his antics, <b>wrinkling</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> in the manner of a high school girl...|$|R
60|$|There, in {{the deep}} shadow where no eye might notice the movement, the old wolf shook off the delicious {{sleepiness}} that still lingered in all her big muscles. First she spread her slender fore paws, working the toes till they were all wide-awake, and bent her body at the shoulders till her deep chest touched the earth. Next a hind leg stretched out straight and tense as a bar, and was taken back again in nervous little jerks. At {{the same time she}} yawned mightily, <b>wrinkling</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> and showing <b>her</b> red gums with the black fringes and the long white fangs that could reach a deer's heart in a single snap. Then she leaped upon a great rock and sat up straight, with her bushy tail curled close about her fore paws, a savage, powerful, noble-looking beast, peering down gravely over the green mountains to the shining sea.|$|R
5000|$|Zelda Gilroy (Sheila James) was a {{brilliant}} and eager young girl, hopelessly in love with Dobie, much to his annoyance. Zelda did not find Dobie particularly attractive, but {{fell in love with}} him because she found him helpless and needing of her care, and also because of the concept of [...] "propinquity" [...] (that is, nearness; as Gillis and Gilroy, they were typically seated together in class). Despite his protests, Dobie was clearly fond of Zelda, and Zelda claimed Dobie loved her but just had not realized it yet. To prove this, she would <b>wrinkle</b> <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> (with a squint) at Dobie, who would do the same back to Zelda, though Dobie said it was only a reflex that made him do it (and he invariably responded to her with an exasperated [...] "Now cut that out!"). Dobie and Zelda would later appear as a middle-aged married couple in the two spin-off Dobie Gillis reunion projects of the 1970s/1980s.|$|R
60|$|After this Amy subsided, till a mania for {{sketching}} {{from nature}} set her to haunting river, field, and wood, for picturesque studies, and sighing for ruins to copy. She caught endless colds sitting on damp grass to book 'a delicious bit', {{composed of a}} stone, a stump, one mushroom, and a broken mullein stalk, or 'a heavenly mass of clouds', {{that looked like a}} choice display of featherbeds when done. She sacrificed her complexion floating on the river in the midsummer sun to study light and shade, and got a <b>wrinkle</b> over <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> trying after 'points of sight', or whatever the squint-and-string performance is called.|$|R
60|$|Reassured, Cecilia walked {{round the}} room {{as far as this}} was possible, for it was {{practically}} all furniture. There was the same little <b>wrinkle</b> across <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> as across Thyme's nose when she spoke of Hound Street. Suddenly she caught sight of Hilary. He was standing with his back against the door. On his face was a strange and bitter look, such as a man might have on seeing the face of Ugliness herself, feeling that she was not only without him, but within--a universal spirit; the look {{of a man who had}} thought that he was chivalrous, and found that he was not; of a leader about to give an order that he would not himself have executed.|$|R
6000|$|His father, he observed, with {{a feeling}} of relief, was absent from home--not a matter of {{uncommon}} occurrence, for that worthy man's avocations often called him out at untimeous hours. Mrs Maggot was in bed snoring, and <b>wrinkling</b> up <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> in consequence of a fly having perched itself obstinately on the point thereof. Zackey, with the red earth of the mine still streaking his manly countenance, was rolled-up like a ball in his own bed in a dark recess of the room, and little Grace Maggot could be seen in the dim perspective of a closet, also sound asleep, in her own neat little bed, with her hair streaming over the pillow, and the [...] "chet" [...] reposing happily on her neck.|$|R
60|$|You figure her, I hope, {{with her}} white bundle, {{a sort of}} erect black ant, hurrying along the little white path-thread athwart the downland slopes under the {{hot sun of the}} summer afternoon. On she {{struggled}} after <b>her</b> resolute indefatigable <b>nose,</b> and the poppies in her bonnet quivered perpetually and her spring-side boots grew whiter and whiter with the downland dust. Flip-flap, flip-flap went her footfalls through the still heat of the day, and persistently, incurably, her umbrella sought to slip from under the elbow that retained it. The mouth <b>wrinkle</b> under <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> was pursed to an extreme resolution, and ever and again she told her umbrella to come up or gave her tightly clutched bundle a vindictive jerk. And at times her lips mumbled with fragments of some foreseen argument between herself and Skinner.|$|R
60|$|He was {{conscious}} of nothing but his book; however, she found the logarithms, and brought them to Mr. Ernescliffe, staying {{to look at his}} drawing, and asking what he was making out. He replied, smiling at the impossibility of her understanding, but she <b>wrinkled</b> <b>her</b> brown forehead, hooked <b>her</b> long <b>nose,</b> and spent the next hour in amateur navigation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good morning, Little Bo-Peep!" [...] {{and looking}} up the girl saw a woman {{standing}} near her and leaning upon a short stick. She was bent nearly double by weight of many years, her hair was white as snow and her eyes as black as coals. Deep <b>wrinkles</b> seamed <b>her</b> face and hands, while <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> and chin were so pointed that they nearly met. She was not pleasant to look upon, but Bo-Peep had learned to be polite to the aged, so she answered, sweetly, ...|$|R
60|$|Betty's {{forehead}} was <b>wrinkled.</b> <b>Her</b> eyes wore a far-away expression.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Gannett, <b>wrinkling</b> <b>her</b> forehead, {{eyed the}} marvellous bird curiously.|$|R
60|$|She <b>wrinkled</b> <b>her</b> brows in {{a puzzled}} frown, and her colour deepened.|$|R
60|$|Mary Phillips <b>wrinkled</b> <b>her</b> {{forehead}} and gazed steadfastly into her lap. Suddenly she looked up.|$|R
60|$|LADY ELLA. Her clothes must be ruined. That pond--ugh! [She <b>wrinkles</b> <b>her</b> nose] Tommy, do have it drained.|$|R
6000|$|... "What's {{that you}} say, Tommy?" [...] {{interrupted}} old Martha, putting {{her hand to}} <b>her</b> ear and <b>wrinkling</b> <b>her</b> brow interrogatively.|$|R
60|$|The {{figure of}} the girl seated in the big {{armchair}} did not stir. Her lips pouted contemptuously, a frown <b>wrinkled</b> <b>her</b> forehead.|$|R
60|$|Jill <b>wrinkled</b> <b>her</b> forehead. That odd {{familiar}} {{look was}} in his eyes again. But memory failed to respond. She shook her head.|$|R
60|$|I {{turned as}} I had been bid, expecting such a treat as only the revealment of divine glory to mortal eyes might produce. What I {{saw was a}} solid phalanx of armed men between myself and a dais {{supporting}} a great bench of carved sorapus wood. On this bench, or throne, squatted a female black. She was evidently very old. Not a hair remained upon <b>her</b> <b>wrinkled</b> skull. With the exception of two yellow fangs she was entirely toothless. On either side of <b>her</b> thin, hawk-like <b>nose</b> <b>her</b> eyes burned {{from the depths of}} horribly sunken sockets. The skin of her face was seamed and creased with a million deepcut furrows. Her body was as <b>wrinkled</b> as <b>her</b> face, and as repulsive.|$|R
50|$|And pecked off <b>her</b> <b>nose.</b>|$|R
60|$|While Amy dressed, she issued her orders, and Jo obeyed them, {{not without}} {{entering}} her protest, however, for she sighed as she rustled into her new organdie, frowned darkly at {{herself as she}} tied her bonnet strings in an irreproachable bow, wrestled viciously with pins as she put on <b>her</b> collar, <b>wrinkled</b> up <b>her</b> features generally as she shook out the handkerchief, whose embroidery was as irritating to <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> as the present mission was to her feelings, and when she had squeezed her hands into tight gloves with three buttons and a tassel, as the last touch of elegance, she turned to Amy with an imbecile expression of countenance, saying meekly...|$|R
60|$|Elizabeth leaned towards him. She {{was very}} loth indeed to {{acknowledge}} defeat. Once more {{her voice was}} deliciously soft, <b>her</b> forehead delicately <b>wrinkled,</b> <b>her</b> blue eyes filled with alluring light.|$|R
60|$|The lady {{in black}} satin {{appeared}} undecided. She looked from Anna, who {{was far too}} nice-looking to be travelling about alone, to that reassuring pile of luggage, and <b>wrinkled</b> <b>her</b> brows thoughtfully.|$|R
60|$|Willard {{unlocked}} the door and showed Miss Sally over the place. Miss Sally poked and pried and sniffed and <b>wrinkled</b> <b>her</b> forehead, and finally stood on the stairs and delivered her ultimatum.|$|R
60|$|In the Crescent gardens Stella {{herself was}} sitting on a camp stool, sketching. He stole up close behind. How fair and pretty she was, bent diligently, holding up <b>her</b> brush, measuring, <b>wrinkling</b> <b>her</b> brows.|$|R
60|$|SYBIL [screwing <b>her</b> <b>nose</b> deliciously]. He is at it again, Auntie.|$|R
