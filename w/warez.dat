5|$|A demo of The Age of Kings was {{released}} on October 16, 1999. It featured the learning campaign, a sample of a random map game, {{and the ability to}} play via the MSN Gaming Zone. Much to Ensemble Studios' disappointment, numerous incomplete versions of the game were leaked. These were picked up by <b>warez</b> sites, and sold illegally throughout the Pacific Rim; <b>warez</b> versions of the game were even sold outside Microsoft's offices in South Korea.|$|E
25|$|<b>Warez</b> traders {{share many}} {{similarities}} to both hackers and crackers. Primary <b>warez</b> distribution groups include a single cracker that renders all copy protected technologies in a <b>warez</b> inoperable. Unlike the typical {{age of a}} hacker and cracker, the general age and demographics of a <b>warez</b> trader are older and married IT professionals. The need for attention is another similarity between the {{groups as well as}} believe that digital property should be free.|$|E
25|$|Infected <b>warez</b> {{directly}} from the <b>warez</b> scene on the other hand, is a very unusual occurrence. The malicious content is usually added at a later stage by third parties.|$|E
25|$|<b>Warez</b> {{are often}} {{distributed}} outside of The Scene (a collection of <b>warez</b> groups) by torrents (files including tracker info, piece size, uncompressed file size, comments, and vary {{in size from}} 1k, to 400k.) uploaded to a popular P2P website by an associate or friend of the cracker or cracking crew. An nfo or FILE ID.DIZ is often made to promote who created the release. It is then leeched (downloaded) by users of the tracker and spread to other sharing sites using P2P, or other sources such as newsgroups. From there, it can be downloaded by millions of users all over the world. Often, one release is duplicated, renamed, then re-uploaded to different sites so that eventually, it can become impossible to trace the original file. Another increasingly popular method of distributing <b>Warez</b> is via one-click hosting websites. In the early 1990s, <b>warez</b> were often traded on cassette tapes with different groups and published on bulletin boards that had a <b>warez</b> section.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{advertise}} {{the existence of}} the compromised site, the IRC software would join public IRC <b>warez</b> channels as a bot and post into the channel with occasional status messages every few minutes, providing information about how many people are logged into the <b>warez</b> host, how many files are currently being downloaded, what the upload/download ratio is (to force users into contributing data of their own before they can download), which <b>warez</b> distributor is running the bot, and other status information.|$|E
25|$|The script {{language}} PPL and PPE's {{which became}} more and more available, increased the popularity of PCBoard and emerged by the mid nineties as the de facto-standard BBS system for <b>warez</b> BBS on the IBM PC. The <b>warez</b> BBS's used mostly pirated versions of the BBS software and thus did not appear in any official sales or usage statistic for the software. What PCBoard was for <b>warez</b> BBSes on the IBM PC, was Amiexpress for BBSes running on Commodore Amiga computers.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{development}} of modern peer-to-peer sharing systems and home broadband service, sharing <b>warez</b> sometimes involved <b>warez</b> groups scanning the Internet for weakly secured computer systems with high-speed connections. These weakly secured systems would be compromised by exploiting the poor FTP security, creating a special directory on the server with an unassuming name to contain the illegal content.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} and/or {{distribution of}} <b>warez</b> is illegal {{in most countries}} due to the protections provided in the TRIPS Agreement. Software infringers generally exploit the international nature of the copyright issue to avoid law enforcement in specific countries. Violations are typically overlooked in poorer third world countries, and other countries with weak or non-existent protection for intellectual property. Additionally, some first world countries have loopholes in legislation that allow the <b>warez</b> to continue.|$|E
25|$|It was {{important}} for <b>warez</b> group members to regulate who had access to these compromised FTP servers, to keep the network bandwidth usage low. A site that suddenly became very popular would be noticed by the real owners of the equipment, as their business systems became slow or low on disk space; investigation of system usage would then inevitably result in discovery and removal of the <b>warez,</b> and tightening of the site security.|$|E
25|$|This {{functionality}} {{still exists}} and {{can still be}} found on IRC <b>warez</b> channels, {{as an alternative to}} the modern and streamlined P2P distribution systems. The opportunity to find and compromise poorly secured systems on which to create an illicit <b>warez</b> distribution site has only increased with the popular use of broadband service by home users who may not fully understand the security implications of having their home computer always turned on and connected to the Internet.|$|E
25|$|A {{common mistake}} of early FTP administrators was to permit a {{directory}} named /incoming that allows full {{read and write}} access by external users, but the files themselves in /incoming were hidden; by creating a directory inside /incoming, this hidden directory would then allow normal file viewing. Users of the compromised site would be directed to log in {{and go to a}} location such as /incoming/data/warez to find the <b>warez</b> content. Messages could be left for other <b>warez</b> users by uploading a plain text file with the message inside.|$|E
25|$|While few arrests {{had been}} made {{by the time of the}} first press releases, repercussions ran deep in the <b>warez</b> scene. Countless sites closed as a direct {{response}} to the busts, and many active scene members went into hiding.|$|E
25|$|There is {{generally}} a distinction made between different sub-types of <b>warez.</b> The unusual spellings shown here {{were commonly used}} as directory names within a compromised server, to organize the files rather than having them all thrown together in a single random collection.|$|E
25|$|The {{small amount}} of sample data made tracker chiptunes far more space-efficient than most other types of tracker music, which made them {{appealing}} to size-limited demoscene demos and crack intros. Tracker chiptunes have also been commonly used in other <b>warez</b> scene executables such as keygens.|$|E
25|$|Zero-day or 0-day - Any copyrighted {{work that}} has been {{released}} {{the same day as}} the original product, or sometimes even before. It is considered a mark of skill among <b>warez</b> distro groups to crack and distribute a program on the same day of its commercial release.|$|E
25|$|Some {{general purpose}} Bulletin Board Systems had special levels of access that {{were given to}} those who paid extra money, {{uploaded}} useful files or knew the SysOp personally. These specialty and pay BBSes usually had something unique to offer their users, such as large file libraries, <b>warez,</b> pornography, chat rooms or Internet access.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{there are}} four {{elements}} of criminal copyright infringement: {{the existence of a}} valid copyright, that copyright was infringed, the infringement was willful, and the infringement was either substantial, or for commercial gain (at levels often set by statute). Offering <b>warez</b> is generally understood to be a form of copyright infringement that is punishable as either a civil wrong or a crime.|$|E
25|$|The industry's {{decision}} to embrace VHS {{in the early}} 1980s, for example, helped {{to do away with}} Sony Betamax, despite the latter format's superior quality. Video rentals soared from just under 80 million in 1985 to half-billion by 1993. Suffering at the hands of video <b>warez</b> tended not be publicly stressed by country's film industry. In 1999 there were 711 million rentals of hardcore films. 11,300 hardcore films were released in 2002.|$|E
25|$|As {{the ability}} to {{compromise}} and attain full remote control of business servers became more developed, the <b>warez</b> groups would hack a server and install an IRC bot on the compromised systems alongside the FTP service, or the IRC bot would provide file sharing directly by itself. This software would intelligently regulate access to the illicit data by using file queues to limit bandwidth usage, or by only running during off-hours overnight when the business owning the compromised hardware was closed for the day.|$|E
25|$|Some BBSes, called elite, <b>WaReZ</b> or pirate boards, were {{exclusively}} {{used for}} distributing cracked software, phreaking, and other questionable or unlawful content. These BBSes often had multiple modems and phone lines, allowing several users to {{upload and download}} files at once. Most elite BBSes used some form of new user verification, where new users would have to apply for membership and attempt {{to prove that they}} were not a law enforcement officer or a lamer. The largest elite boards accepted users by invitation only. Elite boards also spawned their own subculture and gave rise to the slang known today as leetspeak.|$|E
25|$|Operation Site Down is the {{umbrella}} {{name for a}} law enforcement initiative conducted by the FBI and law enforcement agents from ten other countries {{which resulted in a}} raid on targets on June 29, 2005. Three separate undercover investigations were involved, based in Chicago (Operation Jolly Roger), Charlotte and San Jose (Operation Copycat). The raid consisted of approximately 70 searches in the United States and approximately 20 others in ten other countries in an effort to disrupt and dismantle many of the leading <b>warez</b> groups which distribute and trade in copyrighted software, movies, music and games on the Internet.|$|E
25|$|In the past, {{files were}} {{distributed}} by point-to-point technology: {{with a central}} uploader distributing files to downloaders. With these systems, {{a large number of}} downloaders for a popular file uses an increasingly larger amount of bandwidth. If there are too many downloads, the server can become unavailable. The opposite is true for peer-to-peer networking; the more downloaders the faster the file distribution is. With swarming technology as implemented in file sharing systems like eDonkey2000 or BitTorrent, downloaders help the uploader by picking up some of its uploading responsibilities. There are many sites with links to One-click hosting websites and other sites where one can upload files that contribute to the growing amount of <b>warez.</b>|$|E
500|$|Promotion for {{the album}} began in November 2006 {{with the band}} {{performing}} [...] "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race" [...] {{for the first time}} at the American Music Awards on November 21. The song was shipped to radio the same night as the performance. In the week following the performance, the single was the top added track at Pop and Alternative radio. While the song was the first song revealed from the album, it would not receive an official single release until January 2007. [...] "The Carpal Tunnel of Love" [...] was released as a digital single in December 2006. It was a minor hit in the United States, peaking at 81 on the Billboard Hot 100. The band then began the Friends or Enemies Tour in January 2007 to build interest in the album. The tour consisted of intimate club shows in fifteen cities throughout the United States, with New Found Glory, The Early November, Permanent Me and Lifetime. Two weeks before Infinity on High was released, the album was leaked online, which led to rumors on the band's message boards that the album would be released a week early. Although these rumors were incorrect, Fall Out Boy responded to the leak by including an exclusive live EP, Leaked in London, recorded in London's Hammersmith Palais at their sold-out show on January 29, 2006, with each purchase to encourage fans to buy the album. The EP could be downloaded from the band's website between Tuesday, February 6, 2007 and Tuesday, February 13, 2007 using CDPass software along with inserting a physical copy of Infinity on High into the CD-ROM drive of one's computer. Infinity on High was the final release from Rabid Neurosis, a <b>warez</b> organization responsible for leaking 20,000 albums before their release.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Warez</b> is {{a common}} {{computing}} and broader cultural term referring to pirated software (i.e. illegally copied, often after deactivation of anti-piracy measures) that is distributed via the Internet. <b>Warez</b> is used most commonly as a noun, a plural form of ware (short for computer software), and {{is intended to be}} pronounced like the word , [...] The circumvention of copy protection (cracking) is an essential step in generating <b>warez,</b> and based on this common mechanism, the software-focused definition has been extended to include other copyright-protected materials, including movies and games. The global array of <b>warez</b> groups has been referred to as [...] "The Scene," [...] deriving from its earlier description as [...] "the <b>warez</b> scene." [...] Distribution and trade of copyrighted works without payment of fees or royalties generally violates national and international copyright laws and agreements. The term <b>warez</b> covers supported as well as unsupported (abandonware) items, and legal prohibitions governing creation and distribution of <b>warez</b> cover both profit-driven and [...] "enthusiast" [...] generators and distributors of such items.|$|E
2500|$|The term <b>warez,</b> {{which is}} {{intended}} to be pronounced like the word [...] "wares" [...] (/ˈwɛərz/), was coined in the 1990s; its origin is with an unknown member of an underground computing circle, but has since become commonplace among Internet users and the mass media. It is used most commonly as a noun: [...] "My neighbour downloaded 10 gigabytes of <b>warez</b> yesterday"; but has also been used as a verb: [...] "The new Windows was warezed a month before the company officially released it". The global collection of <b>warez</b> groups has been referred to as [...] "The <b>Warez</b> Scene," [...] or more ambiguously [...] "The Scene." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hackers {{would also}} use known {{software}} bugs to illicitly gain full administrative remote {{control over a}} computer, and install a hidden FTP service to host their wares. This FTP service was usually running on an unusual port number, or with a non-anonymous login name like [...] "login: <b>warez</b> / Password: warez" [...] to help prevent discovery by legitimate users; information about this compromised system would then be distributed to {{a select group of}} people who were part of the <b>warez</b> scene.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Warez,</b> and its leetspeak form W4r3z, are plural {{representations}} of the word [...] "ware" [...] (short for computer software), and are terms {{used to refer to}} [...] "irated software distributed over the Internet," [...] that is, [...] "oftware that has been illegally copied and made available" [...] e.g., after having [...] "protection codes de-activated". [...] "Cracking, or circumventing copy protection, {{is an essential part of}} the <b>warez</b> process," [...] and via this commonality, the definition focused on computer software has been extended to include other forms of material under copyright protection, especially movies. As Aaron Schwabach notes, the term covers both supported and unsupported materials (the latter unsupported, termed abandonware), and legal recourses aimed at stemming the creation and distribution of <b>warez</b> are designed to cover both profit-driven and [...] "enthusiast" [...] practitioners. Hence, the term refers to copyrighted works that are distributed without fees or royalties and so traded in general violation of copyright law.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{laws and}} their {{application}} to <b>warez</b> activities may vary greatly {{from country to}} country; for instance, while Wawa-Mania is under sanction in France, it remains in operation via a host in Moldova, and through use of an Ecuadorian top-level domain. Hence, while high-profile web hosts and domain providers generally do not permit the hosting of <b>warez,</b> and delete sites found to be hosting them, private endeavours and small commercial entities continue to allow the trade in <b>warez</b> to continue. And, in some countries, and at some times, software [...] "piracy" [...] has been encouraged, and international and usual national legal protections ignored. A dispute between Iran and United States over membership in WTO and subsequent U.S. block of Iran's attempts at full-membership has led Iran to encourage the copying of U.S. software; hence, {{there has been a}} subsequent surge in Iranian [...] "warez" [...] and [...] "crackz" [...] websites (as Iranian laws do not forbid hosting them inside Iran. The same policy has been adopted by Antigua, and others.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Warez</b> {{groups like}} PWA and DOD {{released}} several PPEs which {{were used by}} a lot of Sysops. Examples are the PWA [...] "NewScan" [...] PPE, the PWA [...] "Files-Reverse" [...] PPE and the DOD [...] "LARS Upload Processor".|$|E
2500|$|Often sites hosting torrent files {{claim that}} they are not {{breaking}} any laws because they are not offering the actual data, rather only a link to other places or peers that contain the infringing material. However, many prosecution cases and convictions argue to the contrary. For instance, Dimitri Mader, the French national who operates a movie distribution <b>warez</b> site, Wawa-Mania, was fined 20,000 € and sentenced, in absentia, to a year in jail by a European court (after fleeing France for the Philippines), for his role in managing the site. In the U.S., through 2004, more than 80 individuals had been prosecuted and convicted for trade in <b>warez</b> products (under the NET Act and other statutes), for movie and software pirating in particular, with a number of individuals being imprisoned, including some enthusiast traders.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{a common}} {{perception}} that <b>warez</b> sites represent high risk in terms of malware. In addition, there are several papers showing there is indeed correlation between warez/file sharing sites and malware. In particular, one study shows that out of all domains the study classified as pirate, 7.1% are infected (while out of random domains only 0.4% were infected); another study maintains that '"maliciousness" [...] of the content for sites they classified as pirate (which specifically included <b>warez</b> sites) is the highest among all the researched site categories. Domains related to anti-copy protection tools {{are among the most}} malicious sites. Another study specifically targeted anti-copy protection tools such as cracks and key generators. They conclude that the majority of these programs aim to infect the user's computer with one or more types of malware. The chance of the end-user being exposed to malicious code when dealing with cracked applications or games is more than 50%.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1990s, {{the average}} Internet user {{was still on}} dial-up, with average speed ranging between 28.8 and 33.6 kbit/s. If one wished to {{download}} a piece of software, which could run about 200 MB, the download time could be longer than one day, depending on network traffic, the Internet Service Provider, and the server. Around 1997, broadband began to gain popularity due to its greatly increased network speeds. As [...] "large-sized file transfer" [...] problems became less severe, <b>warez</b> became more widespread and began to affect large software files like animations and movies.|$|E
