5000|$|In {{countries}} where a single standard gauge is dominant, the term light railway {{does not imply}} a narrow gauge railway. Most narrow gauge railways operate as light railways, but not all light railways need be narrow gauge. After Spooner's development of steam haulage for narrow gauge railways, the prevailing view was that the gauge should be tailored according to the traffic: [...] "The nearer the machine is apportioned to the work {{it has to do}} the cheaper will that work be done." [...] From the 1890s, it was recognised that cost savings could also be made in the construction and operation of a standard gauge railway: [...] "light axle-loads and low speeds, not gauge, are the first condition of cheap construction and economical <b>working.</b> <b>Gauge</b> is quite a secondary factor." [...] Break of gauge now became an important factor, and there was much concern over whether this would become an additional cost for the transshipment of goods, or whether this was over-emphasised compared to the amount of warehousing and handling needed anyway. The Irish railway system in particular became a good example of a broad gauge main line system with many independent narrow gauge, , light railway feeder branch lines.|$|E

Standard cars are imported models from GT4 and GT PSP, they have lower polygon counts and texture resolution, standard headlights and basic damage modelling. In addition, after the Spec 2.0 update they feature simplified interior camera views. For open-topped cars, {{they have a}} functioning steering wheel and <b>working</b> <b>gauges.</b> Premium cars are cars modeled for GT5 and thus have higher polygon counts, high texture resolution, feature headlights capable {{of high and low}} beams, detailed interior camera views, and detailed damage models. Premium cars also have working windshield wipers which are operated on tracks with rain or snow. Around 20% of all cars in the game fall into the [...] "premium" [...] category. [...] "Premium" [...] cars also allow for vast customization, including (but not limited to): aerodynamic kits, engine tune-ups, weight reduction, etc. [...] "Standard" [...] cars are also able to have modifications such as weight reductions and tuneups.

The rules for dealing with the infinities that had to be subtracted were a big challenge, culminating in the discovery of the Becchi–Rouet–Stora–Tyutin symmetry. Fond recollections of the numerous discussions the author had with Raymond Stora on this topic are memorised here.
