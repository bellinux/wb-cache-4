500|$|While near peak {{intensity}} on October17, Joan was located about 2100km (1300mi) east of Typhoon Ivan, which had also reached super typhoon status; the JTWC later {{noted that it}} was [...] "the first observation of two tropical cyclones of such extreme intensity existing simultaneously in the Northwest Pacific." [...] Despite the proximity to Ivan, the two typhoons did not undergo the Fujiwhara effect. The JTWC estimated that Joan weakened slightly after reaching peak winds, although the JMA maintained the typhoon at {{peak intensity}} for nearly three whole days. Joan gradually turned more to the northwest, passing between Anatahan and Saipan in the Northern Marianas Islands (NMI) on October18. On October20, the JMA estimated that the typhoon began weakening, and {{on the same day}} Joan turned sharply to the north. On the next day, Joan weakened below super typhoon intensity {{for the first time in}} 4.5days, a record at the time based on JTWC analysis. This record was later surpassed by Typhoon Fengshen in 2002 and Typhoon Ioke in 2006. By October21, the typhoon had accelerated to the east and was quickly weakening. The next day, Joan passed about 230km (145mi) north of the Japanese island of Iwo Jima. On October24, the typhoon turned to the northeast while losing tropical characteristics, and that day the JMA ceased tracking Joan. The JTWC declared the typhoon as extratropical on October25 around the same time it crossed the international date line. Former Typhoon Joan merged with a cold front and re-intensified while approaching the Aleutian Islands, and was noted by the Mariners <b>Weather</b> <b>Log</b> as an extratropical storm on October26.|$|E
500|$|Around {{the time}} of peak intensity, Maemi was slowing its forward motion and began turning to the north, after the eastward-moving trough {{weakened}} the ridge. At 1900UTC on September10, the typhoon passed within 10km (7mi) of Miyako-jima. While the eye was passing over the island, the pressure fell to [...] and winds reached 250km/h (155mph). Maemi weakened slightly as it continued north, passing about 220km (140mi) west of Okinawa on September11 while undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle. Increasingly hostile conditions from the approaching trough caused further weakening, and the JTWC estimated the typhoon passed just east of Jeju Island with 1-minute winds of 185km/h (115mph) at 0600UTC on September12. Shortly after, Maemi made landfall just west of Busan, South Korea, with the JMA estimating 10-minute winds of 140km/h (85mph), and JTWC estimating 1-minute winds of 165km/h (105mph). Risk Management Solutions estimated landfall winds of 190km/h (120mph), which surpassed Typhoon Sarah in 1959. This made Maemi the strongest typhoon to strike the country since the Korea Meteorological Administration began keeping records in 1904. The storm was able to maintain much of its intensity due to warm sea surface temperatures and its fast forward motion. Maemi rapidly weakened to tropical storm status while moving over land, and was undergoing extratropical transition {{by the time it}} entered the Sea of Japan. Increasing wind shear removed the convection from the increasingly ill-defined circulation center. The JTWC issued its final warning on Maemi early on September13, declaring the storm extratropical. The JMA followed suit later that day, tracking Maemi over northern Japan and declaring it extratropical over the Sea of Okhotsk. The remnants of Maemi persisted for several more days, until the JMA stopped tracking it on September16 southwest of the Kamchatka Peninsula. According to the Mariners <b>Weather</b> <b>Log,</b> the remnants of Maemi continued to the east, eventually striking the coast of Alaska on September21.|$|E

50|$|After {{a strong}} layer of sticks (or reeds) was wrapped through {{and over the}} {{radiating}} roof timbers, the people often applied a layer of thatch {{as part of the}} roof. The structure was then entirely covered in earth. The earth layer (and the partially subterranean foundation) provided insulation against the extreme temperatures of the Plains. The structures consisted of a clay outer shell over an inner shell of long grasses and a woven willow ceiling. The middle of the earth lodge was used as a fire pit, and a hole was built into the center.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an experimental interactive installation, a so-called “experience cylinder”, intended as a travelogue and developed specifically to provide a narrative about the Viking ship Sea Stallion’s voyage from Roskilde to Dublin and back. The installation provides a framework for individual experience of the Sea Stallion's voyage, where a user among the audience interacts with the installation. Interaction is mainly by position and gesture tracking and feedback is by selection and projection of objects, such as photos, videos, background images, synthesized sound and recited stories. All combine to provide an individual path of choice through a coherent story told by means of a cylindrical screen, enclosing a space providing 3 D positional sound following the interacting user and exploiting data such as wind, wave and <b>weather</b> <b>logs</b> through 3 D sound effects. While being intended to tell a story about a certain voyage the resulting installation has been developed as an open interactive platform suitable for story-telling/travelogue.

40|$|Forest {{ecosystems}} across North America {{are under}} increasing stress from the accelerating pace of global change which involves simultaneous changes in resource availability (temperature, moisture, nutrients), disturbance regimes (fire, insects, diseases, extreme <b>weather,</b> <b>logging,</b> urbanization) and (3) species distributions (invasive organisms, threatened species). Interactions among {{the agents of}} global change can generate emergent or unexpected ecosystem behaviour. Complex systems science provides a strong theoretical foundation for understanding these factor interactions and provides many new mathematical and simulation modeling tools that can generate complex, non-linear behaviour and provide improved understanding of ecosystem response to global change. I present {{an updated version of}} Jenny’s (1941) classic state factor model of soils and ecosystems that allows three variables (resources, disturbance and plant-soil functional groups) to interact to generate higher orders of complexity through self-organizing plant-soil feedback switches. An interactive agent-based model allows the user to vary the degree of change in resource availability, disturbance frequency or severity and the strength of negative and positive plant-soil feedbacks and to measure the effect of these changes on ecosystem resilience, diversity and landscape complexity. The model is currently being used to simulate the dynamics of lodgepole pine-Cladina-lichen dominated landscapes in central British Columbia that has been massively affected by interactions among changing fire regimes, mountain pine beetle and a warming climate...|$|R

50|$|The Eastern Pacific best track {{database}} {{was initially}} compiled on magnetic tape in 1976 for the seasons between 1949 and 1975, at the NHC {{to help with}} the development of two tropical cyclone forecast models, which required tracks of past cyclones as a base for its predictions.

40|$|The Schwalbenberg II loess-paleosol {{sequence}} (LPS) denotes a key {{site for}} Marine Isotope Stage (MIS 3) in Western Europe owing to eight succeeding cambisols, which primarily constitute the Ahrgau Subformation. Therefore, this LPS {{qualifies as a}} test candidate for the potential of temporal high-resolution geochemical data obtained X-ray fluorescence (XRF) scanning of discrete samplesproviding a fast and non-destructive tool for determining the element composition. The geochemical data is first contextualized to existing proxy data such as magnetic susceptibility (MS) and organic carbon (Corg) and then aggregated to element log ratios characteristic for weathering intensity [LOG (Ca/Sr), LOG (Rb/Sr), LOG (Ba/Sr), LOG (Rb/K) ] and dust provenance [LOG (Ti/Zr), LOG (Ti/Al), LOG (Si/Al) ]. Generally, an interpretation of rock magnetic particles is challenged in western Europe, where not only magnetic enhancement but also depletion plays a role. Our data indicates leaching and top-soil erosion induced MS depletion at the Schwalbenberg II LPS. Besides <b>weathering,</b> <b>LOG</b> (Ca/Sr) is susceptible for secondary calcification. Thus, also LOG (Rb/Sr) and LOG (Ba/Sr) are shown {{to be influenced by}} calcification dynamics. Consequently, LOG (Rb/K) seems to be the most suitable weathering index identifying the Sinzig Soils S 1 and S 2 as the most pronounced paleosols for this site. Sinzig Soil S 3 is enclosed by gelic gleysols and in contrast to S 1 and S 2 only initially weathered pointing to colder climate conditions. Also the Remagen Soils are characterized by subtle to moderate positive excursions in the weathering indices. Comparing the Schwalbenberg II LPS with the nearby Eifel Lake Sediment Archive (ELSA) and other more distant German, Austrian and Czech LPS while discussing time and climate as limiting factors for pedogenesis, we suggest that the lithologically determined paleosols are in-situ soil formations. The provenance indices document a Zr-enrichment at the transition from the Ahrgau to the Hesbaye Subformation. This is explained by a conceptual model incorporating multiple sediment recycling and sorting effects in eolian and fluvial domains...|$|R
