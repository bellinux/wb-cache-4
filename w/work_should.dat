5|$|Like Lovinescu, other {{advocates of}} modernist {{literature}} rejected most of Cerna's contributions. One {{of the first}} to have done so is Ovid Densusianu, who stated his belief that an artist's <b>work</b> <b>should</b> be separated from his life. Lovinescu, who commented on Densusianu and his thoughts on Cerna, opined that Densusianu had a tendency to reject all poets who registered popular success, and that he treated Dimitrie Anghel's work in much the same way.|$|E
5|$|That Autumn the {{government}} conducted a formal inquiry into military aviation. Capper {{had to return}} early from Blair Atholl in order to present his evidence. He argued strongly for a promising future {{of all forms of}} aeronautics and especially the aeroplane. However his Army superiors on the committee were against aeronautics in any form. It was decided that only small-scale airship experiments should continue and that aeroplane <b>work</b> <b>should</b> be stopped. It formally ceased when Dunne and Cody's contracts ran {{out at the end of}} March 1909.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} workhouse labour was never clear {{according}} to historian M. A. Crowther. In {{the early days}} of workhouses it was either a punishment or a source of income for the parish, but during the 19thcentury the idea of work as punishment became increasingly unfashionable. The idea took hold that <b>work</b> <b>should</b> rehabilitate the workhouse inmates for their eventual independence, and that it should therefore be rewarded with no more than the workers' maintenance, otherwise there would be no incentive for them to seek work elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Auroras {{departure}} from Australia was delayed {{by a series}} of organisational and financial setbacks, and the party did not arrive in McMurdo Sound until 16 January 1915—very late in the season for depot-laying work. Mackintosh, who believed that Shackleton might attempt to cross the continent in that first season, insisted that sledging <b>work</b> <b>should</b> begin without delay, with a view to laying down supply depots at 79° and 80°S. Joyce opposed this; more time, he maintained, should be set aside to acclimatise and train men and dogs. However he was overruled by Mackintosh, who was unaware that Shackleton had ruled out a crossing that season.|$|E
5|$|Following the report, the NRM {{commissioned}} First Class Partnerships (FCP) to independently {{review the}} remaining work identified as necessary by the NRM, and make recommendations {{on how to}} proceed. In March 2013, the museum announced FCP had determined the locomotive would {{not return to the}} main line until 2015, and believed the outstanding <b>work</b> <b>should</b> be put out to external tender. On 29 October 2013 the museum announced Riley & Son in Bury as the winning contractor, and the same day the locomotive was moved to their workshop in order to return it to running condition no earlier than summer 2015. On 29 April 2015, Flying Scotsmans boiler left the National Railway Museum to be reunited {{with the rest of the}} locomotive at Riley & Son in Bury.|$|E
5|$|Other Marxists, such as George Derwent Thomson and Neil Faulkner, {{have argued}} that Childe's archaeological <b>work</b> <b>should</b> not {{correctly}} be considered Marxist because he failed {{to take into account}} the existence of class struggle as an instrument of social change, something which was a core tenet of Marxist thought. While class struggle was not a factor he considered in his archaeological work, Childe did accept that historians and archaeologists typically interpreted the past through their own class interests, and that most of his contemporaries were producing studies with an innate bourgeois agenda. Childe also diverged from orthodox Marxism by not employing dialectics in his methodology. Furthermore, he denied Marxism's ability to predict the future development of human society, and did not consider humanity's development into pure communism to be inevitable, instead opining that society could fossilize or become extinct instead.|$|E

5|$|The Book of Household Management {{has been}} edited, revised and {{enlarged}} several times since Isabella's death {{and is still}} in print as at 2016. Food writers have stated that the subsequent editions of the work were far removed from and inferior to the original version. Several cookery writers, including Elizabeth David and Clarissa Dickson Wright, have criticised Isabella's work, particularly her use of other people's recipes. Others, such as the food writer Bee Wilson, consider the censure overstated, and that Beeton and her <b>work</b> <b>should</b> be thought extraordinary and admirable. Her name has become associated with knowledge and authority on Victorian cooking and home management, and the Oxford English Dictionary states that by 1891 the term Mrs Beeton had become used as a generic name for a domestic authority. She is also considered a strong influence in the building or shaping of a middle-class identity of the Victorian era.|$|E
5|$|The {{search for}} a singer-actress to play Carmen began {{in the summer of}} 1873. Press {{speculation}} favoured Zulma Bouffar, who was perhaps the librettists' preferred choice. She had sung leading roles in many of Offenbach's operas, but she was unacceptable to Bizet and was turned down by du Locle as unsuitable. In September an approach was made to Marie Roze, well known for previous triumphs at the Opéra-Comique, the Opéra and in London. She refused the part when she learned that she would be required to die on stage. The role was then offered to Célestine Galli-Marié, who agreed to terms with du Locle after several months' negotiation. Galli-Marié, a demanding and at times tempestuous performer, would prove a staunch ally of Bizet, often supporting his resistance to demands from the management that the <b>work</b> <b>should</b> be toned down. At the time it was generally believed that she and the composer were conducting a love affair during the months of rehearsal.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the right}} to be {{identified}} has been asserted, it applies for the duration of copyright, but only for works created after 1 August 1989. If the right is then infringed, the author or director has legal recourse. For {{the right to}} be infringed, the author must show that they have not been properly identified, that this was in circumstances where the <b>work</b> <b>should</b> have been attributed, and that none of the exceptions or defences apply. In regards to the lack of proper identification, for identification to be acceptable the name of the author must appear in each copy of the work in a prominent fashion, under Section 77(7) of the 1988 Act; where it is not appropriate for the author's name to appear on each copy, it must appear in a fashion that brings their identity to the attention of any person using or acquiring a copy of the work. If the work is a building, the name must be visible to people entering or approaching it. If the author specifies a pseudonym or some other form of identification when asserting the right of attribution, that form of identification should be adopted.|$|E

5|$|The History of Ferdinand and Isabella was {{published}} on Christmas Day, 1837 by the American Stationery Company, Boston, with a print run of 500copies. It {{was dedicated to}} his father. To the surprise of Prescott and the publisher, the book sold very well—the original print run was insufficient to adequately supply Boston's bookshops, let alone the whole nation's. It {{was first published in}} London by Richard Bentley in early 1838. The work received excellent critical reviews, both in America and in Britain, where Henry Vassall-Fox and Robert Southey expressed their admiration of the work. It was also noticed in France, despite the fact that a French translation was not available at the time. Prescott was adamant that his <b>work</b> <b>should</b> not be altered by anyone other than himself, and when he heard that his publishers were considering an abridgement of the History of Ferdinand and Isabella in June 1839, he produced an abridgement of the work himself, which resulted in the original project's cancellation. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in May 1839.|$|E
5|$|Weber's essay The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism is {{his most}} famous work. It is argued that this <b>work</b> <b>should</b> {{not be viewed as}} a {{detailed}} study of Protestantism, but rather as an introduction into Weber's later works, especially his studies of interaction between various religious ideas and economic behaviour as part of the rationalisation of the economic system. In The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, Weber put forward the thesis that Calvinist ethic and ideas influenced the development of capitalism. He noted the post-Reformation shift of Europe's economic centre away from Catholic countries such as France, Spain and Italy, and toward Protestant countries such as the Netherlands, England, Scotland and Germany. Weber also noted that societies having more Protestants were those with a more highly developed capitalist economy. Similarly, in societies with different religions, most successful business leaders were Protestant. Weber thus argued that Roman Catholicism impeded the development of the capitalist economy in the West, as did other religions such as Confucianism and Buddhism elsewhere in the world.|$|E

40|$|The Fair Use Doctrine allows {{unauthorized}} uses of copyrighted {{works by}} scholars, reporters, and parodists but {{does little to}} protect creative critics or non-commercial transformative works. The Fair Use Doctrine is valuable because it provides cover for criticism, derivation, and creativity using copyrighted works without requiring permission. It also acknowledges the derivative nature of much creation. To better protect derivative works and their authors, fair use must be modified in two ways. First, creative criticisms of non-technical <b>works</b> <b>should</b> receive stronger protection. Second, non-commercial derivative <b>works</b> <b>should</b> be presumptively fair use. These modifications will be a start towards protecting a large and vibrant community producing both creatively critical and entertaining derivative works borrowing from the settings, characters and concerns of earlier authors...|$|R
