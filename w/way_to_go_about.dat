Kneale recalled of his visit to Kingswood Warren, [...] "The sort of impression you got of the folk who worked there was a boyishness. [...] They were very cheerful.

Ebner stated that [...] "Hacking their site is not really the best <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> taking them (the Church of Scientology) down. Most critics you talk to want the Scientology site to be up there so that people who are interested can see the stupidity they have on the web and at the same time they can go - they are a few keystrokes from getting a thousand other opinions." [...] Nick Douglas explained that the group decided to shift their strategy away from the attacks to Scientology websites: [...] "Anonymous even decided that they were going to stop that attack, that it was a bad idea. It's the usual thing they used to do when they really hadn't had a thought out plan, and here they're realizing they actually have to figure out some real plan against a real enemy." ...|$|E

In the song [...] "Shoulda Known Better", she {{reflects}} on her optimistic wish that Rhythm Nation 1814 could have profoundly changed the world, noting that there are many, deeper issues to fix and that broad strokes aren't enough. The chorus includes the line, [...] "Cause I don't want my face to be / That poster child for being naive"; and Rhythm Nations title {{is referred to as}} [...] "an epiphany", with Jackson mentioning that [...] "next time, I'll know better." [...] Album co-producer Jimmy Jam told the BBC: [...] "When you're young, you feel like: 'I can change the world! I'm going to lead the revolution!' And then you look 25 years later and you go: 'OK, I should have known better. The same problems still exist but there's a different <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> tackling it. It still involves mobilising people, but I can't do it by myself.' It's just a wiser, more mature look at the reality of trying to make a positive change, a social change." ...|$|E

The band later performed in Japan with Between the Buried and Me. Drummer Michael Justian rejoined the band in February 2010, shortly after Fickeisen departed. Fickeisen commented his departure: [...] "There is no easy <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> leaving a busy band with plans in constant motion, but a little abruptly, I chose to depart from manning the kit for The Red Chord.

2500|$|While Borges was {{the great}} popularizer of the review of an {{imaginary}} work, he had developed the idea from Thomas Carlyle's Sartor Resartus, a book-length review of a non-existent German transcendentalist work, and the biography of its equally non-existent author. In This Craft of Verse, Borges says that in 1916 in Geneva [...] " [...] discovered, and was overwhelmed by, Thomas Carlyle. I read Sartor Resartus, and I can recall many of its pages; I know them by heart." [...] In the introduction to his first published volume of fiction, The Garden of Forking Paths, Borges remarks, [...] "It is a laborious madness and an impoverishing one, the madness of composing vast books, setting out in five hundred pages an idea that can be perfectly related orally in five minutes. The better <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> it is to pretend that those books already exist, and offer a summary, a commentary on them." [...] He then cites both Sartor Resartus and Samuel Butler's The Fair Haven, remarking, however, that [...] "those works suffer under the imperfection that they themselves are books, and not a whit less tautological than the others. A more reasonable, more inept, and more lazy man, I have chosen to write notes on imaginary books." ...|$|E

However, at last, after many secret disputes with myself, and after great perplexities about it (for all these arguments, one way and another, struggled in my head a long time), the eager prevailing desire of deliverance at length mastered all the rest; and I resolved, if possible, to get one of these savages into my hands, cost what it would. My next thing was to contrive how to do it, and this, indeed, was very difficult to resolve on; but as I could pitch upon no probable means for it, so I resolved to put myself upon the watch, to see them when they came on shore, and leave the rest to the event; taking such measures as the opportunity should present, let what would be.|$|E

With the behavioral characteristic of equifinality involved, it is hard to know when the system of the Interactional View is happening or not. Equifinality is the systems theory assumption that a given outcome could have occurred due to any or many interconnected factors rather than being a result in a cause—effect relationship. This theory rests on the word communication, but this word can be interpreted very differently between people. The definitions of communication can be very controversial. Overall, the axioms do a great job of explaining problems, but do not provide solutions to the problems they bring up.|$|R
