5|$|Burkard von Müllenheim-Rechberg saw Lindemann for {{the last}} time at around 08:00 on the command bridge just prior to the final battle. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg {{described}} the normally intelligent, humorous and optimistic Lindemann now as pessimistic and withdrawn. Von Müllenheim-Rechberg tried to talk to him and was ignored, and later <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> this was due to combat fatigue or whether the disagreements with Lütjens had worn him down.|$|E
5|$|In New York, Sanders {{encountered}} {{a different form}} of racism. At Montefiore Hospital, where she performed her clinical training, black nurses were given worse assignments than white nurses. White patients sometimes were abusive toward black nurses. While the racial climate in New York {{was better than the}} situation in Alabama, Sanders frequently <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> she had merely exchanged Jim Crow racism for a more genteel prejudice.|$|E
5|$|In 1987 Nuttin {{published}} his second study, describing experiments done in 1984 and 1985 {{with the help}} of Hilde Sas. Because of the far-reaching implications of the name-letter effect for psychological theories, Nuttin found it wise to first test the effect's generality and robustness, before setting off on a research program aimed at understanding the underlying affective and cognitive processes at work. He <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> the effect would be found in all cultural and linguistic communities, or whether the first study revealed an effect due to some unknown idiosyncratic aspect of the Dutch language in Belgium.|$|E

5|$|Questions {{were asked}} in the House of Commons {{about the cost of}} {{policing}} the statue, which required six constables a day at a cost of £700 a year. London's police commissioner wrote to Battersea Council to ask that they contribute to it. Councillor John Archer, later Mayor of Battersea and the first black mayor in London, told the Daily Mail that he was amazed by the request, considering Battersea was already paying £22,000 a year in police rates. The Canine Defence League <b>wondered</b> <b>whether,</b> if Battersea were to organize raids on laboratories, the laboratories would be asked to pay the policing costs themselves.|$|E
5|$|When Terra's {{character}} was first revealed, 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish found {{him to be}} very similar to Zack Fair from Final Fantasy VII {{to the point where he}} <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> he would actually be Zack. However, when considering Terra's weapon being a Keyblade in contrast to all the other Final Fantasy characters shown in previous Kingdom Hearts games, he thought he may not be Zack. Amanda L. Kondolojy from Cheat Code Central found there have been various speculations regarding the similarities between Terra and Zack, but thought it would not be strange considering the existence of Nobodies in the series. Selecting Terra for a demo of Birth by Sleep IGN's Ryan Clements agreed with Parish, finding only minor differences between their outfits.|$|E
5|$|Writer and {{producer}} Bob Gale conceived the idea after he visited {{his parents in}} St. Louis, Missouri {{after the release of}} Used Cars. Searching their basement, Gale found his father's high school yearbook and discovered he was president of his graduating class. Gale thought about the president of his own graduating class, who was someone {{he had nothing to do}} with. Gale <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> he would have been friends with his father if they went to high school together. When he returned to California, he told Robert Zemeckis his new concept. Zemeckis subsequently thought of a mother claiming she never kissed a boy at school when, in fact, she was highly promiscuous. The two took the project to Columbia Pictures, and made a development deal for a script in September 1980.|$|E

5|$|At the {{procession}} to George's lying in state in Westminster Hall {{part of the}} Imperial State Crown fell from {{on top of the}} coffin and landed in the gutter as the cortège turned into New Palace Yard. The new king, Edward VIII, saw it fall and <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> it was a bad omen for his new reign. As a mark of respect to their father, George's four surviving sons, Edward, Albert, Henry, and George, mounted the guard, known as the Vigil of the Princes, at the catafalque on the night before the funeral. The vigil was not repeated until the death of George's daughter-in-law, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, in 2002. George V was interred at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 28 January 1936. Edward abdicated before the year was out, leaving his brother Albert, Duke of York, to ascend the throne (taking the regnal name George VI).|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1994, Pixar's story {{department}} began turning their thoughts to their next film. The storyline for A Bug's Life originated from a lunchtime conversation between John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter, and Joe Ranft, the studio's head story team; other films such as Monsters, Inc. and Finding Nemo were also conceived at this lunch. Lasseter and his story team had already been drawn {{to the idea of}} insects serving as characters. Like toys, insects were within the reach of computer animation back then, due to their relatively simple surfaces. Stanton and Ranft <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> they could find a starting point in Aesop's fable The Ant and the Grasshopper. Walt Disney had produced his own version with a cheerier ending decades earlier in the 1934 short film The Grasshopper and the Ants. In addition, Walt Disney Feature Animation (now Walt Disney Animation Studios) had considered producing a film in the late-1980s entitled Army Ants, that centered around a pacifist ant living in a militaristic colony, but this never fully materialized.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} {{satisfying}} moments in the Go series, the IGN and TouchArcade reviewers appreciated the game mechanic of determining how best to use a hack or drone to slip past enemies. The IGN reviewer found the game's puzzles somewhat harder than those of its predecessors, but was able to easily resolve them upon after taking brief breaks. The game's minimalism also led to some complications. Some of the solutions, he complained, were dependent on unintuitive player experimentation, such as realizing that the invisibility device {{also served as a}} projectile. Some of these visual cues were lost amidst the game's visual presentation. TouchArcade <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> the simplified environment was an aesthetic choice or the result of efforts to save on development costs. The GameSpot reviewer was disappointed to see an option for paid puzzle solutions in an otherwise short game about discovering the secret to a puzzle on one's own. Compared to the main series, in which the player may stake out a building at a distance, the experimentation in Deus Ex Go is limited to finding the right answer rather than finding multiple routes to solve the same problem.|$|E

5|$|Uttanka then <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> {{he could}} reach his guru Veda's ashram {{to hand over the}} {{earrings}} to the guru's wife before the prescribed time. The rider, noting Uttanka's concern, gave Uttanka his horse, which took Uttanka to the ashram. He reached the ashram just before sunset as the guru's wife {{was in the process of}} casting a curse on Uttanka for not arriving in time. When Uttanka narrated his experience in procuring the earrings, the guru and his wife blessed him. Veda then explained to Uttanka the significance of the sights he had seen in Nagaloka. The two women engaged in weaving were Dhata and Vidhata; they were creating the world and all its creatures. The threads were day and night. The wheel with twelve spokes was the year with 360 days. The six boys were the seasons. The giant and bullock were Indra and his elephant Airavata. Its dung was amrita (elixir of life), which kept Uttanka alive in Nagaloka. The rider and horse in Nagaloka were Indra and the fire-god Agni. Veda also explained to Uttanka that his friend, Indra, had helped him during his journey.|$|E

25|$|Routledge says in {{her notes}} that a Rapanui elder {{told her that}} all the manu miro ('wood birds') were inscribed with glyphs. However, text X {{is the only one}} known (Fischer 1997). Fischer accepts it as genuine and speculates 'Perhaps it was {{obtained}} on Rapanui {{in the first half of}} the nineteenth century by an American whaler.' However, other scholars have <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> the inscription might have been added later.|$|E
25|$|Patrick Surkin, {{who ran the}} {{intensive}} care unit at Tel Aviv Medical Centre, <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> a toxin might be the culprit behind the infections. He contacted David Pargament, chief of the Yarkon River Authority, who explained that 36 hours before the collapse, mosquito larvicide oil, a mixture of jet fuel and oil, had been sprayed {{on the surface of the}} Yarkon to suppress mosquitoes. Subsequent lab tests, however, found no traces of the substance in the sick athletes.|$|E

30|$|The {{different}} SWB terms have {{qualitatively different}} meanings and histories, so we <b>wonder</b> <b>whether</b> {{they can be}} used interchangeably.

25|$|Several fans {{reading the}} series have <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> Clamp was hinting a romantical {{relationship}} {{going on between}} Kamui and Fuma. In response, in the book Understanding Manga and Anime writer Robin E. Brenner stated Clamp had no of those intentions as he compared them with the more explicit relationship Subaru had with Seishiro. Kamui's appearance in Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle proved to be popular as he was voted as the sixth most popular character in the second poll.|$|E
25|$|With Europe facing World War I, {{whoever was}} {{selected}} would face {{the difficulty of}} leading the Holy See through the war to end all wars, in which Catholic Belgium and France were attacked by Protestant Germany, which was supported by Catholic Austria while the Protestant United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (including Catholic Ireland) and Russian Orthodox Russia sided with France. Critics <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> the Holy See should remain neutral or whether it should assume a position of moral leadership by casting public judgments on the behaviour of the various combatants.|$|E
25|$|Neanderthals {{inhabited}} much of Europe {{and western}} Asia {{from as far}} back as 130,000 years ago. They existed in Europe as late as 30,000 years ago. They were eventually replaced by anatomically modern humans (AMH; sometimes known as Cro-Magnons), who began to appear in Europe circa 40,000 years ago. Given that the two hominid species likely coexisted in Europe, anthropologists have long <b>wondered</b> <b>whether</b> the two interacted. The question was resolved only in 2010, when it was established that Eurasian populations exhibit Neanderthal admixture, estimated at 1.5–2.1% on average. The question now became whether this admixture had taken place in Europe, or rather in the Levant, prior to AMH. migration into Europe.|$|E
