Upset by the violence and cruelty, Violet seeks solace from Corky. She tells Corky that she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> new life for herself, but that she needs her help. Knowing that Caesar will find the nearly $2 million Shelly took and count it in their apartment, the two women hatch a scheme to steal the money. Corky, already wary of Violet's intentions, is unsure whether to trust her.|$|E
5|$|Mulder goes {{to see the}} Shooter, despite Spender's objections. Mulder {{wants to}} give the Shooter {{immunity}} in exchange for testimony, which the Shooter refuses. Gibson proves his abilities {{to a group of}} clinicians while Scully and Fowley watch. The guard at the prison hands the Shooter a flattened Morley cigarette box that says he's a dead man. Scully visits the Lone Gunmen, wanting them to analyze the data from Gibson. She asks them who Diana is, and they tell her she worked closely with Mulder when he discovered the X-Files. The Smoking Man meets with Jeffrey in the FBI parking lot, but disappears when Mulder spots them talking. Scully and Mulder present to Skinner on Gibson, who displays extraordinary brain activities. Mulder believes that Gibson is the key to everything in the X-Files, and <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> deal with the Shooter. Diana and Skinner think this may result in adverse attention from the attorney general, and that the X-Files could be closed down if things go wrong, but Mulder dismisses that risk.|$|E

[...] Shortly after the PC release, Blow released resources for a level editor for Braid that allow users to import new graphics into the game.|$|E
500|$|McCay {{pioneered the}} [...] "McCay Split System" [...] of animation, in which major poses or {{positions}} were drawn {{first and the}} intervening frames drawn after. [...] This relieved tedium and improved {{the timing of the}} film's actions. [...] McCay was open about the techniques that he developed, and refused to patent his system, reportedly saying, [...] "Any idiot that <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> couple of thousand drawings for a hundred feet of film is welcome to join the club." [...] During production of Gertie, he showed the details to a visitor who claimed to be writing an article about animation. The visitor was animator John Randolph Bray, who sued McCay in 1914 after taking advantage of McCay's lapse to patent many of the techniques, including the use of registration marks, tracing paper, and the Mutoscope action viewer, and the cycling of drawings to create repetitive action. [...] The suit was unsuccessful, and there is evidence that McCay may have countersued—he received royalty payments from Bray for licensing the techniques.|$|E
500|$|Nash, {{whose father}} {{was born in the}} Tottenham {{district}} of London, is a lifelong Tottenham Hotspur supporter, and has expressed interest in owning a minority stake in the club. [...] "I'd like to be an owner. It's something I could do {{for the rest of my}} life after my little window of popularity dies", he said in an interview with The New York Times. Nash added, [...] "I've been a passionate supporter all my life. My parents are from north London and so it's not like I'm some Yank who <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> profit out of football. I don't care about making money. I just want to see Spurs succeed and, if I can help, that's great." [...] However, he said any participation in Spurs would come after his basketball career is over, and he has had only [...] "casual contact" [...] with chairman Daniel Levy and former director of football Damien Comolli. Nash is also a fan of Spain's FC Barcelona, and Brazilian team Sport Club Corinthians Paulista, which his former Suns teammate Leandro Barbosa supports. When Barbosa visited Corinthians in 2007, the club gave him a shirt with Nash's name and jersey number.|$|E

500|$|A {{few weeks}} after {{becoming}} [...] "Dr." [...] Hubbard, he wrote to Helen O'Brien—who {{had taken over the}} day-to-day management of Scientology in the United States—proposing that Scientology should be transformed into a religion. As membership declined and finances grew tighter, Hubbard had reversed the hostility to religion he voiced in Dianetics. His letter to O'Brien discussed the legal and financial benefits of religious status. The idea may not have been new; Hubbard has been quoted as telling a science fiction convention in 1948: [...] "Writing for a penny a word is ridiculous. If a man really <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> million dollars, the best way would be to start his own religion." [...] Scholar J. Gordon Melton notes, [...] "There is no record of Hubbard having ever made this statement, though several of his science fiction colleagues have noted the broaching of the subject on one of their informal conversations." [...] The Church of Scientology has denied that Hubbard said this and insists that it is a misattributed quote that was said instead by George Orwell. Hubbard outlined plans for setting up a chain of [...] "Spiritual Guidance Centers" [...] charging customers $500 for twenty-four hours of auditing ("That is real money... Charge enough and we'd be swamped."). He wrote: ...|$|E
2500|$|After Rick Santorum, then a U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania, made {{comments}} in 2003 {{to a reporter}} comparing homosexual sex to bestiality and incest, Savage assailed Santorum in his column. Later, he sponsored a contest {{that led to the}} term santorum being used to refer to [...] "the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes a byproduct of anal sex". (See Campaign for the neologism santorum.) Savage set up a website to publicize this application of the term. In 2010, Savage offered to take down his website if Rick Santorum would agree to donate US$5 million to a gay rights group. The organization, Freedom to Marry, advocates on behalf of same-sex marriage in the United States. Savage told Mother Jones in 2010, [...] "If Rick Santorum <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> $5 million donation to [...] Freedom to Marry, I will take it down. Interest starts accruing now." [...] Evan Wolfson, executive director of Freedom to Marry, responded in a statement to Metro Weekly, [...] "Support for Freedom to Marry's national campaign would be welcome—and a good way for Rick Santorum to start cleaning up the discriminatory mess he and his companions have made." ...|$|E
2500|$|Loevy {{denies that}} {{the script for}} Murder in Television House (2001) was a {{critique}} of Israeli public television. He had enlisted Batya Gur, a popular writer of detective fiction, {{to tell the story}} of a murder that took place in Channel 66, a fictional commercial television station. Some critics, however, considered the story to be a settling of accounts with Channel 1. The film revolves around several plot axes, one of which is the story of a veteran director who <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> film about the story [...] "Ido and Einam" [...] by the Nobel laureate Shmuel Yosef Agnon, but has the project rejected by the petty authorities who manage the station. The director decides to make the film anyway, but his girlfriend, the set designer is soon murdered, initiating a chain of murders at the station. Two factors adding to the complexity of the story is the fact that the murdered woman is also the ex-wife of the director's close friend, the station's senior programming manager, and the Agnon story that he is filming is also a story about a love triangle.|$|E
