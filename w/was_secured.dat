40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{show that}} major cryptosystems such as FDH, OAEP, and RSA-KEM <b>are</b> <b>secure</b> under a hash {{function}} MD h with Merkle-Damg˚ard (MD) construction that uses a random oracle compression function h. First, we propose two new ideal primitives called Traceable Random Oracle (T RO) and Extension Attack Simulatable Random Oracle (ERO) which are weaker than a random oracle (RO). Second, {{we show that}} MD h is indifferentiable from LRO, T RO and ERO, where LRO is Leaky Random Oracle proposed by Yoneyama et al. This result means that if a cryptosystem <b>is</b> <b>secure</b> in these models, then the cryptosystem <b>is</b> <b>secure</b> under MD h following the indifferentiability theory proposed by Maurer et al. Finally, we prove that OAEP <b>is</b> <b>secure</b> in the T RO model and RSA-KEM <b>is</b> <b>secure</b> in the ERO model. Since it is also known that FDH <b>is</b> <b>secure</b> in the LRO model, as a result, major cryptosystems, FDH, OAEP and RSA-KEM, <b>are</b> <b>secure</b> under MD h, though MD h is not indifferentiable from RO...|$|R
