5|$|Gimmick!, known outside Japan as Mr. Gimmick, is a {{platform}} video game developed {{and published by}} Sunsoft, and originally released in Japan for the Family Computer on 31 January 1992. The story follows a small green character named Yumetaro who was given to a young girl as a birthday present. One night, the girl's other toys become jealous of the attention he is receiving, and <b>whisk</b> the girl away to another dimension. Playing as Yumetaro, the player must maneuver {{through a variety of}} levels, using the protagonist's star-shooting power to defeat enemies and progress through the game.|$|E
5|$|Mariko {{is brought}} before Shingen at Ichirō's estate when ninjas led by Harada attack and <b>whisk</b> her away. Logan and Yukio arrive later and, using Ichirō's X-ray machine, {{discover}} a robotic parasite attached to Logan's heart, suppressing his healing ability. Logan cuts himself open and extracts the device. During the operation, Shingen attacks but Yukio holds Shingen off {{long enough for}} Logan to recover and kill Shingen. Logan follows Mariko's trail {{to the village of}} Ichirō's birth, where he is captured by Harada's ninjas. Logan is placed in a machine by Dr. Green, who reveals her plans to extract his healing factor and introduces him to the Silver Samurai, an electromechanical suit of Japanese armour with energized swords made of adamantium. Mariko escapes from Harada, who believes he is acting in Mariko's interests, and frees Logan from the machine. Harada sees the error of his ways and is killed by the Silver Samurai while helping Logan escape.|$|E
5|$|Gifford arrives, {{and most}} of the town attends the celebratory event, where Chef sings a song to seduce her. Mr. Garrison takes his {{position}} in a tall book depository, but he is frustrated to see that Gifford is hidden behind a bulletproof glass bubble. Wendy and Stan arrive and try unsuccessfully to stop Mr. Garrison, saying that they understand his pain, but when Stan accidentally reignites Garrison's anger, he decides to go through with the assassination. Just as he's about to fire, Cartman's new immense weight causes the stage to collapse, catapulting Gifford off it, and causing the bullet to hit Kenny in the head. Kenny is propelled through the air and impaled on a flagpole. Gifford's bodyguards <b>whisk</b> Gifford away, costing a disappointed Cartman his chance to be on television. Wendy takes to the stage and reveals that Cartman cheated on his essay, but the townspeople are too upset about Gifford's departure to care. Mr. Garrison is taken to a mental hospital, where Mr. Hat is placed into a straitjacket. Mr. Garrison apologizes to the kids for costing the town a chance to be on television, although Kyle explains to him that Cartman is now appearing on talk show Geraldo because of his tremendous obesity. The episode ends with Chef having sex with Gifford while watching Geraldo.|$|E
50|$|Sniffing, a high-frequency, highly rhythmic {{inhalation}} and exhalation of {{air through}} the nose, {{plays an important}} role in rodent olfaction. <b>Whisking</b> is thought to be co-ordinated with sniffing and normal respiratory behaviour. It has been shown that breathing and <b>whisking</b> movements are correlated only when the <b>whisking</b> rhythm is less than 5 Hz. Only 13% of <b>whisking</b> movements occur during high-frequency (greater than 5 Hz) respiration typically associated with sniffing, indicating that high-frequency <b>whisking</b> and sniffing behaviours are not correlated.|$|R
50|$|Early studies (1964) {{described}} co-ordination between vibrissae, nose, head, and sniffing movements. From {{these studies}} {{it was suggested}} that the animal's <b>whisking</b> behaviour is dependent on the task and that <b>whisking</b> during exploratory behaviors is different from <b>whisking</b> during discriminative behaviours.|$|R

25|$|To make hollandaise sauce, {{the eggs}} yolks are {{separated}} {{and added to}} a butter base with small amounts of water, vinegar or lemon juice with pepper, heated together slowly over a double boiler. A stainless steel bowl over a sauce pan {{with a small amount}} of water may also be used. The water should not touch the bowl or boil, just simmer. The key to the recipe is to heat the ingredients without curdling the egg. Add the egg and liquid ingredients first and <b>whisk</b> together with a wire <b>whisk</b> until frothy. Add the egg and liquid froth to the double boiler of the simmering water and <b>whisk</b> quickly and continuously. The mixture will expand a few times. Remove from the heat source and begin adding warm, melted, clarified butter to the mixture. If the sauce cools too much the butter will begin to thicken. If this or separation begins to occur, a few drops of hot water can solve this issue.|$|E

50|$|Amongst {{those species}} with motile macrovibrissae, some (rats, mice, flying squirrels, gerbils, chincillas, hamsters, shrews, porcupines, opossums) move {{them back and}} forth {{periodically}} in a movement known as <b>whisking,</b> while other species (cats, dogs, racoons, pandas) do not appear to. The distribution of mechanoreceptor types in the whisker follicle differs between rats and cats, which may correspond to this {{difference in the way}} they are used. <b>Whisking</b> movements are amongst the fastest produced by mammals. In all <b>whisking</b> animals in which it has so far been measured, these <b>whisking</b> movements are rapidly controlled in response to behavioural and environmental conditions. The <b>whisking</b> movements occur in bouts of variable duration, and at rates between 3 and 25 whisks/second. Movements of the whiskers are closely co-ordinated with those of the head and body.|$|R
40|$|Rats {{sense the}} {{environment}} through rhythmic vibrissa protractions, called active <b>whisking,</b> {{which can be}} simulated in anesthetized rats by electrically stimulating the facial motor nerve. Using this method, we investigated barrel cortex field potential and superior colliculus single-unit responses during passive touch, <b>whisking</b> movement, active touch, and texture discrimination. Similar to passive touch, <b>whisking</b> movement is signaled during {{the onset of the}} whisker protraction by short-latency responses in barrel cortex that drive corticotectal responses in superior colliculus, and all these responses show robust adaptation with increases in <b>whisking</b> frequency. Active touch and texture are signaled by longer latency responses, first in superior colliculus during the rising phase of the protraction, likely driven by trigeminotectal inputs, and later in barrel cortex by the falling phase of the protraction. Thus, superior colliculus is part of a broader vibrissa neural network that can decode <b>whisking</b> movement, active touch, and texture...|$|R

25|$|Linen shirts had deep cuffs. Shirt sleeves became fuller {{throughout}} the period. To the 1620s, a collar wired to stick out horizontally, called a <b>whisk,</b> was popular. Other styles included an unstarched ruff-like collar and, later, a rectangular falling band {{lying on the}} shoulders. Pointed Van Dyke beards, named after the painter Anthony van Dyck, were fashionable, and men often grew a large, wide moustache, as well.|$|E
40|$|Sniffing and <b>whisking</b> typify the {{exploratory}} behavior of rodents. These actions involve separate oscillators in the medulla, located respectively in the pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) and the vibrissa-related {{region of the}} intermediate reticular formation (vIRt). We examine how these oscillators synergize to control sniffing and <b>whisking.</b> We find that the vIRt contains glycinergic/GABAergic cells that rhythmically inhibit vibrissa facial motoneurons. As {{a basis for the}} entrainment of <b>whisking</b> by breathing, but not vice versa, we provide evidence for unidirectional connections from the preBötC to the vIRt. The preBötC further contributes to the control of the mystacial pad. Lastly, we show that bilateral synchrony of <b>whisking</b> relies on the respiratory rhythm, consistent with commissural connections between preBötC cells. These data yield a putative circuit in which the preBötC acts as a master clock for the synchronization of vibrissa, pad, and snout movements, {{as well as for the}} bilateral synchronization of <b>whisking...</b>|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{impact of}} social stimuli on the {{membrane}} potential dynamics of barrel cortex neurons is unknown. We obtained in vivo whole-cell recordings in the barrel cortex of head-restrained rats while they interacted with conspecifics. Social touch {{was associated with}} a depolarization and large membrane potential fluctuations locked to the rat’s <b>whisking.</b> Both depolarization and membrane potential fluctuations were already observed prior to contact and did not occur during free <b>whisking.</b> This anticipatory pre-contact depolarization was not seen in passive social touch in anesthetized animals. The membrane potential fluctuations locked to the rat’s <b>whisking</b> observed in interactions with awake conspecifics were larger than those seen for <b>whisking</b> onto nonconspecific stimuli (stuffed rats, objects, and the experimenter’s hand). Responses did not correlate with whisker movement parameters. We conclude that responses to social touch differ from conventional tactile responses in (1) amplitude, (2) locking to <b>whisking,</b> and (3) pre-contact membrane potential changes...|$|R

Historically, the initiation ceremony into {{the secrets of}} the Nnukwu-Ozo involved the very painful and prestigious Ichi scarification, by which these men were identified in public. The Ichi scarification as part of the ritual has been discontinued in modern times for aesthetic reasons. The last bearer of Ichi marks, Chief Ezenwosu died in the early twentieth century. Other distinctive pieces of regalia that identify the Ozo title holder and the Nnukwu-Ozo title holder in Awka-Etiti are the red cap (with eagle feathers for the Nnukwu-Ozo), the horse tail fly <b>whisk,</b> the round cow hide fan and the elephant tusk.|$|E
50|$|The {{effector}} system generating <b>whisking</b> comprises {{a set of}} “extrinsic” muscles controlling movements of the mystacial pad {{and a group of}} “intrinsic” (follicular) muscles, producing vibrissa protraction. The extrinsic muscles in the mystacial pad move many or all of the macrovibrissae together. However, the individual follicles of some groups of facial vibrissae in some species are also motile. A small muscle 'sling' is attached to each macrovibrissa and can move it more-or-less independently of the others. Vibrissa retraction is thought to be a passive process produced by rebound of stretched follicular muscle. <b>Whisking</b> movements are amongst the fastest produced by mammals. In animals that are capable of <b>whisking</b> at high frequencies, the <b>whisking</b> musculature contains a high proportion of type 2B muscle fibers that can support faster contractions than normal skeletal muscles.|$|R
40|$|Rodents {{vary the}} {{frequency}} of <b>whisking</b> movements during ex-ploratory and discriminatory behaviors. The effect of <b>whisking</b> frequency on whisker cortical maps was investigated by simulating <b>whisking</b> at physiological frequencies and imaging the whisker representations with blood oxygen level [...] dependent (BOLD) func-tional magnetic resonance imaging. Repetitive deflection of many right-sided whiskers at 10 Hz evoked a positive BOLD response that extended across contralateral primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and secondary somatosensory cortex (SII). In contrast, synchro-nous deflection of 2 adjacent whiskers (right C 1 and C 2) at 10 Hz evoked separate positive BOLD responses in contralateral SI and SII that were predominantly located in upper cortical layers. The positive BOLD responses were separated and partially surrounded by a negative BOLD response that was mainly in lower cortical layers. Two-whisker representations varied with {{the frequency of}} simulated <b>whisking.</b> Positive BOLD responses were largest with 7 -Hz deflection. Negative BOLD responses were robust at 10 Hz but were weaker or absent with 7 -Hz or 3 -Hz deflection. Our findings suggest that sensory inputs attributable to the frequency of <b>whisking</b> movements modify whisker cortical representations...|$|R

25|$|Mayonnaise {{can be made}} by {{hand with}} a <b>whisk,</b> or fork, or with the aid of an {{electric}} mixer or blender. It is made by slowly adding oil to an egg yolk, while whisking vigorously to disperse the oil. The oil and the water in the yolk form a base of the emulsion, while lecithin and protein from the yolk is the emulsifier that stabilizes it. A combination of van der Waals interactions and electrostatic repulsion determine the bond strength among oil droplets. The high viscosity of mayonnaise is attributed to the total strength created by these two intermolecular forces. Addition of mustard contributes to the taste and further stabilizes the emulsion, as mustard contains small amounts of lecithin. If vinegar is added directly to the yolk, it can emulsify more oil, thus making more mayonnaise.|$|E
25|$|Geelong – Games between Collingwood and Geelong {{have become}} highly {{anticipated}} since 2007. In Round 15 Geelong beat Collingwood by 16 {{points in a}} high-quality match. In the Preliminary final Collingwood surprised many when they came within 5 points of the eventual premiers. In 2008 Collingwood thrashed Geelong by 86 points—20.14 (134)- 7.6 (48) causing Geelong’s only loss of the year. In 2009, the sides again met in the preliminary final, but despite high hopes the Cats, who would again win the premiership, won by 73 points in front of another massive crowd of 87,258. In 2010, the two sides emerged as the favourites for the flag and twice met in front of blockbuster crowds at the MCG when they were placed 1st and 2nd on the ladder—with the results evenly split. They again met in a Preliminary final, this time a resounding win to Collingwood by 41 points. In 2011, both teams were undefeated going into their round eight 'blockbuster' at the 'G. Geelong won by three points, after a controversial advantage was not paid to Magpie Scott Pendlebury in the dying minutes. Pendlebury kicked a goal and would have put the Pies in front, but the free kick was contentiously called back and Geelong managed to <b>whisk</b> the ball away. In the round 24 match, Geelong thumped the Magpies by a record margin of 96 points, which was also Collingwood's biggest ever loss at the MCG. The 2011 Grand Final against the Cats concluded with a 38-point loss for the Pies.|$|E

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that behavioral context modulates phase-locking between rhythmic motor activity and concomitant electrical activity induced in primary sensory (S 1) cortex. We used exploratory <b>whisking</b> by rat as a model system and recorded two measures: (i) the mystacial electromyogram (∇EMG) as a surrogate of vibrissa position, and (ii) the field potential (∇LFP) in S 1 cortex {{as an indicator of}} electrical activity. The degree to which the ∇EMG and ∇LFP were phase-locked was compared for three categories of rhythmic whisking: (i) searching for an object with the vibrissae for a food reward, (ii) <b>whisking</b> in air for the goal of returning to the home cage, and (iii) <b>whisking</b> with no reward. We observed that the magnitude of phase-locking was nearly tripled for the two rewarded conditions compared to unrewarded <b>whisking.</b> Critically, increased locking was not accompanied by an increase in the amplitude of the cortical ∇LFP for the rewarded tasks. Additional experiments showed that there was no significant relation between the amplitude of a sensory-evoked response in S 1 cortex and the magnitude of the locking between the ∇EMG and the ∇LFP during <b>whisking.</b> We conclude that the behavioral context of a <b>whisking</b> task can increase the modulation of S 1 cortical activity by motor output without a concomitant increase in the magnitude of activity...|$|R

50|$|<b>Whisking</b> is a {{behaviour}} {{in which the}} facial whiskers (vibrissae) of an animal are repetitively and rapidly swept back and forth. This behaviour occurs particularly during locomotion and exploration. The <b>whisking</b> movements occur in bouts of variable duration, and at rates between 3 and 25 whisks/second. Movements of the whiskers are closely co-ordinated {{with those of the}} head and body, allowing the animal to locate interesting stimuli through whisker contact, then investigate them further using both the macrovibrissae and an array of shorter, non-actuated microvibrissae on the chin and lips. <b>Whisking</b> has been reported {{in a wide range of}} mammals, including two species of marsupial. <b>Whisking</b> contributes both to exploratory movements, which function to acquire sensory inputs, and to palpation movements, which are used in the discrimination of objects and in the control of spatial navigation.|$|R
40|$|Although somatosensation in {{multiple}} whisker systems {{has been studied}} in considerable detail, relatively little information is available regarding whisker usage and movement patterns during natural behaviors. The Etruscan shrew, {{one of the smallest}} mammals, relies heavily on its whisker system to detect and kill its highly mobile insect prey. Here, we tracked whisker and body motion during prey capture. We found that shrews made periodic whisker movements (<b>whisking)</b> with frequencies ranging from 12 to 17 [*]Hz. We compared shrew and rat <b>whisking</b> and found that shrew <b>whisking</b> was smaller amplitude and higher frequency than rat <b>whisking,</b> but that the shrew and rat <b>whisking</b> cycle were similar in that the velocity was higher during retraction than protraction. We were able to identify four phases during the shrew hunting behavior: (i) an immobile phase often preceding hunting, (ii) a search phase upon the initiation of hunting, (iii) a contact phase defined by whisker-to-cricket contact, and (iv) an attack phase, characterized by a rapid head movement directed toward the cricket. During the searching phase, <b>whisking</b> was generally rhythmic and whiskers were protracted forward. After prey contact, <b>whisking</b> amplitude decreased and became more variable. The final strike was associated with an abrupt head movement toward the prey with high head acceleration. Prey capture proceeded extremely fast and we obtained evidence that shrews can initiate corrective maneuvers with a minimal latency < 30 [*]ms. While the shrew's rostrum is straight and elongated during most behaviors, we show {{for the first time that}} shrews bend their rostrum during the final strike and grip their prey with a parrot beak shaped snout...|$|R
