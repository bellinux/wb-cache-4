5|$|Although in {{some areas}} the marsh shrew is {{sympatric}} {{with other members of}} the genus Sorex, no other large, velvety, gray-black shrew shares this geographic range. Its size distinguishes it from all but the American <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> (Sorex palustris). Although the marsh shrew and the American <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> (the two largest shrews in North America) share some features, the American <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> has more dark-grey-to-black fur on its back, a silver-grey belly and a bi-colored tail and the marsh shrew's fringed hairs are more distinct. The American <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> has a smaller skull, without the marsh shrew's characteristic curvature, and its upper incisors have less-distinct medial tines. The marsh shrew typically has a longer snout than that of the American <b>water</b> <b>shrew,</b> which is more streamlined when viewed from the side.|$|E
5|$|The marsh shrew and the American <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> (Sorex pallustris) {{share many}} {{physical}} characteristics. The former {{is found in}} a narrower area from the northwest coast to the lower slopes of the inland mountains. The American <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> is more widely distributed across the western mountains and through the subarctic regions of Canada and the eastern U.S. The species' ranges are primarily allopatric; although they may overlap (sympatry) in coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest, differences in elevation tend to separate them. Early taxonomists placed these mammals into separate subgenera; Merriam assigned the marsh shrew to Atophyrax, and Jackson (1928) assigned the Pacific <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> to Neosorex. A closer, dentition-based relationship was assigned by Findley (1955), with both species assigned to the subgenus Otisorex. Findley hypothesized {{that in the early}} Pleistocene, the ancestors of masked and vagrant shrews (Sorex cinereus and Sorex vagrans, respectively) diverged; during the Yarmouth interglacial, the American <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> and marsh shrew diverged from their vagrant-shrew ancestors. Three other Sorex species evolved during the Sangamonian: the dwarf shrew (S. nanus), the southeastern shrew (Sorex longirostris) and the ornate shrew (Sorex ornatus). Findley's assignment of the marsh shrew and the American <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> to Otisorex was later reinforced by biochemical and genetic studies. In 2005, findings were published (based on mitochondrial DNA analysis) which better defined the nature of the relationships between marsh shrews, Pacific water shrews and their respective subspecies. Variations in the sequencing of cytochrome b mitochondrial DNA were assessed, and the results of the 2005 phylogeny for the marsh shrew are shown below in detail.|$|E

40|$|American <b>water</b> <b>shrews</b> (Sorex palustris) are {{aggressive}} predators {{that feed}} {{on a variety}} of terrestrial and aquatic prey. They often forage at night, diving into streams and ponds in search of food. We investigated how shrews locate submerged prey using high-speed videography, infrared lighting, and stimuli designed to mimic prey. <b>Shrews</b> attacked brief <b>water</b> movements, indicating motion is an important cue used to detect active or escaping prey. They also bit, retrieved, and attempted to eat model fish made of silicone in preference to other silicone objects showing that tactile cues are important in the absence of movement. In addition, <b>water</b> <b>shrews</b> preferentially sniffed model prey fish and crickets underwater by exhaling and reinhaling air through the nostrils, suggesting olfaction {{plays an important role in}} aquatic foraging. The possibility of echolocation, sonar, or electroreception was investigated by testing for ultrasonic and audible calls above and below water and by presenting electric fields to foraging shrews. We found no evidence for these abilities. We conclude that <b>water</b> <b>shrews</b> detect motion, shape, and smell to find prey underwater. The short latency of attacks to <b>water</b> movements suggests <b>shrews</b> may use a flush-pursuit strategy to capture some prey...|$|R

25|$|The earless {{water rat}} is adapted best {{to a life}} in water {{out of all the}} muroids. It has {{extremely}} long hindfeet, the toes of which are webbed completely, strongly reduced forelegs, absent or invisible ears, very small eyes, and a long tail with a row of hairs at the downside. That row starts at each side of the beginning of the tail as a long white row of hairs; these two rows merge at about 50mm {{from the beginning of the}} tail and the row goes on to the end of the tail. In all these characters, it resembles the elegant <b>water</b> <b>shrew</b> (Nectogale elegans), a good example of convergent evolution.|$|E
25|$|Also {{nearby is}} Beeston Common, {{consisting}} of 24.7 hectares/61 acres of grassland, heath, marsh, fen and secondary woodland. The common {{was made a}} Site of Special Scientific Interest/SA6 in the year 2000 and is habitat {{for a wide range}} of mammals, birds, and insects. There are some forty species of rare flowering plants, and fourteen species of British orchids have been recorded on the common due to its special soil conditions. With such a variety of flowers the site is attractive to butterflies. Twenty-six species have been regularly recorded, including green hairstreak, brown argus and Essex skipper. Kingfisher and heron are also visitors to the pond, and no fewer than 19 species of dragonfly/damselfly have been observed. The bird life of the common includes varieties such as chiffchaff, willow warbler, blackcap, common whitethroat, lesser whitethroat, reed warbler and occasionally sedge and grasshopper warblers. Nightjars are occasionally heard. Foxes and muntjac deer along with smaller mammals such as <b>water</b> <b>shrew,</b> field voles, and harvest mice are present.

[...] No other records for this species exist. Raasay is one of only four of the Inner Hebrides where mountain hares breed. Raasay is regularly visited by white-tailed sea eagles and golden eagles and there are populations of otter, red deer and European rabbit (which were thoughtlessly introduced by the island's proprietor in the 19th century). Stoat and weasel are found in small numbers as are <b>water</b> <b>shrew.</b> It also supports a rich variety of plants, including red broomrape, dark red helleborine, mountain avens and numerous other saxifrages, orchids, alpines and ferns.

500|$|The marsh shrew eats invertebrates, {{including}} spiders, earthworms, sowbugs, centipedes, termites {{and other}} terrestrial and aquatic arthropods.

[...] Other researchers have reported that their diet may also include aquatic insects (water beetles and stonefly nymphs), craneflies, ground beetles, spiders, harvestmen, centipedes, earthworms, slugs and small terrestrial snails. The marsh shrew swims, making short dives in search of food; its mobile snout, whiskers and lips are used to find and capture underwater prey. Before eating, it returns to land. Air trapped in its fur provides buoyancy, and marsh shrews can run {{for as long as}} 3 to 5 seconds {{along the top of the}} water.
