5|$|After the {{restoration}} of Charles II to the throne in 1660, {{a survey of the}} castle was carried out, which recommended repairs to the site. A survey carried {{out at the end of}} the 1730s suggested that the castle had ten artillery positions, but that there <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> guns on the island to arm both the castle and the other defences, and that some of the guns that were available were unusable.|$|E
5|$|Between December, 1941 and June, 1945 U.S. railroads carried almost 44 million armed {{services}} personnel. As there <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> cars and coaches available {{to meet the}} massive need for troop transit created by World War II, in late 1943 the U.S. Office of Defense Transportation contracted with the Pullman Company to build 2,400 troop sleepers, and with American Car and Foundry (ACF) to build 440 troop kitchen cars.|$|E
5|$|Despite her confession, Wise {{pleaded not}} guilty to the charge of murdering Lily Gienke in front of a grand jury on March 23, 1925. She told the grand jury that she was irresistibly {{attracted}} to attending funerals, and that when there <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> funerals in the community, she was driven to create them by killing. Wise was indicted on a charge of first-degree murder on April 7, 1925.|$|E

5|$|In any case, there <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> artillery, but new pieces could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> brought in. This {{was because}} it was very {{difficult}} to move them over land, and there <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> ice to bring them over the sea.|$|R
5|$|During the 2009–10 Indian season, Kartik {{played in}} seven matches for Railways in the Ranji Trophy, taking 17 wickets at 25.05 {{including}} a best of 5/81 against Mumbai.

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 1 September, with only the {{shattered}} remnants its E Company at hand, the U.S. 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division, had virtually no troops to defend Yongsan.

5|$|She was wrecked on 26 February 1852, while {{transporting}} {{troops to}} Algoa Bay at Danger Point near Gansbaai, 87 miles (140 kilometres) from Cape Town, South Africa.

5|$|The Chilean {{government}} delayed their naval plans after {{a financial}} depression {{brought on by}} the 1906 Valparaíso earthquake and a drastic fall in the nitrate market in 1907, but these economic problems <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> to stop them from countering the dreadnoughts purchased by their traditional rival Argentina.

5|$|The {{idea for}} Noodles & Company was {{conceived}} by former Pepsi marketing executive Aaron Kennedy, after eating at Mamie's Asian Noodle Shop in Greenwich Village, New York. He felt there <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> restaurants that served noodle dishes, {{which are a}} staple for many international foods. Kennedy started developing recipes out of his mother-in-law's kitchen with the future COO, Joe Serafin, and head chef, Ross Kamens, in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Washington's {{victories}} wrecked the British carrot-and-stick {{strategy of}} showing overwhelming force then offering generous terms. The Americans would not negotiate for {{anything short of}} independence. These victories alone <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> to ensure ultimate Patriot victory, however, since many soldiers did not reenlist or deserted during the harsh winter. Washington and Congress reorganized the army with increased rewards for staying and punishment for desertion, which raised troop numbers effectively for subsequent battles.|$|E

5|$|A {{period of}} {{rebellion}} {{at the start}} of the 19th century led to the rise of the progressive Sultan Mahmud II and eventually to the Tanzimat period, which produced political reforms and allowed new technology to be introduced to the city. Bridges across the Golden Horn were constructed during this period, and Istanbul was connected to the rest of the European railway network in the 1880s. Modern facilities, such as a water supply network, electricity, telephones, and trams, were gradually introduced to Istanbul over the following decades, although later than to other European cities. The modernization efforts <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> to forestall the decline of the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|As December began, the Japanese {{experienced}} considerable {{difficulty in}} keeping their troops on Guadalcanal resupplied because of Allied air and naval {{attacks on the}} Japanese supply chain of ships and bases. The few supplies delivered to the island <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> to sustain Japanese troops, who by 7 December were losing about 50men each day from malnutrition, disease, and Allied ground or air attacks. The Japanese had delivered almost 30,000 army troops to Guadalcanal since the campaign began, but by December only about 20,000 of that number were still alive, and only about 12,000 remained more or less fit for combat duty, with the rest incapacitated by battle wounds, disease, or malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|As the Tsaress {{planned to}} take {{personal}} care of the church, the church has no parish, {{and there is no}} belltower to call the congregation to divine service. But she died before the construction ended, so the church was never cared for by Elizabeth Petrovna. After Elizabeth's death, the Kiev court took no interest maintaining in the church, last consecrated in 1767. Later, there <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> funds to maintain the church, which left the maintaining of the church to private and voluntary funds, such as Andrey Muraviov.|$|E

His wife, who also fell ill and was {{pregnant}} with the couple's sixth child, was so depressed because of his death and her subsequent financial straits that she suffered a miscarriage. She and the children moved in with Cabell's widowed mother at Cabell's Dale. For several years, she was dependent upon her in-laws for survival; Breckinridge's brother, Robert, assumed Cabell's debts, which he paid in full in 1832.|$|E
5|$|Despite Auburn's {{victory and}} undefeated season, {{they were not}} named {{national}} champions. That honor went to the University of Southern California, which defeated Oklahoma in the 2005 national championship game, 55–19. Three voters in the final Associated Press poll of the season voted Auburn the number one team in the country, but their votes <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> to deny USC a national championship, as voted {{by members of the}} Associated Press and Coaches' polls. Several players from each team were selected in the 2005 NFL Draft and went on to careers in the National Football League.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{lacking the}} {{resources}} to defeat the US breakthrough and simultaneous British and Canadian offensives south of Caumont and Caen, Field Marshal Günther von Kluge, the commander of Army Group B, was not permitted by Hitler to withdraw but was ordered to conduct a counter-offensive at Mortain against the US breakthrough. Four depleted panzer divisions <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> to defeat the First US Army. The disastrous Operation Lüttich drove the Germans deeper into the Allied envelopment.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{took place}} in September and October 2004. Although the story is set in 19th century Cardiff, the {{production}} was actually filmed in Swansea and Monmouth, as there <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> Victorian-looking buildings left in Cardiff. Cardiff's New Theatre {{was used for the}} theatre in which Dickens is telling a story {{at the beginning of the}} episode. An empty Victorian children's home in Penarth was used for Sneed's parlour. Based on research of Victorian morgues, the production team selected red and sepia as the main color scheme.|$|E
5|$|High waves caused beach erosion northward through Virginia. At Virginia Beach, {{the waves}} led to minor {{flooding}} along the Sandbridge section; rough surf {{and a strong}} undertow drowned one swimmer there. The storm triggered statewide power outages that affected about 5,000residents, {{as well as the}} Hampton Roads Bridge–Tunnel. In Newport News, lightning set a roof on fire in the Lee Hall section of the city. Emily's light rains in the area <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> to break a prolonged drought that plagued Virginia. Rough seas and high tides later caused coastal flooding along Fire Island in New York.|$|E

Rachel Bilson, who was recommended to Schwartz after an unsuccessful audition for Everwood, guest-starred as Summer Roberts, whom the producers had envisaged as a tall Californian blonde.
