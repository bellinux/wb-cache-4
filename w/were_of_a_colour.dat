Indeed, we should have stayed at home this year, but last summer twelvemonth there was a fever, and that set on foot a perquisition into our drains at Belforest, and it was satisfactorily proved that we ought by good rights to have been all dead of typhoid long ago. So we turned the workmen in, and they could not of course be got out again. And then Allen fell in love with parquet and tiles, and I was weak enough to think it a good opportunity when all the floors were up. But when a man of taste takes to originality, there's no end of it. Everything has had to be made on purpose, and certain little tiles five times over; for when they did come out the right shape, they <b>were</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>colour</b> that Allen pronounced utter demoralisation. However, we are quite determined to get home this summer, and you and Mary must meet there, and show old Kenminster to Mr. Morgan. Ah! here she comes, and I shall leave you to enjoy this lucid interval of her while Mr. Morgan is doing his last lessons with the children." ...|$|E

2500|$|Banksia flowers <b>are</b> usually <b>a</b> shade <b>of</b> yellow, but orange, red, {{pink and}} even violet flowers also occur. [...] The colour <b>of</b> the flowers <b>is</b> {{determined}} by the colour of the perianth parts and often the style. [...] The style is much longer than the perianth, and is initially trapped by the upper perianth parts. [...] These are gradually released over <b>a</b> period <b>of</b> days, either {{from top to bottom}} or from bottom to top. [...] When the styles and perianth parts are different colours, the visual effect <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>colour</b> change sweeping along the spike. This can be most spectacular in B.prionotes (acorn banksia) and related species, as the white inflorescence in bud becomes a brilliant orange. In most cases, the individual flowers are tall, thin saccate (sack-shaped) in shape.|$|R

25|$|Unlike {{many other}} {{limestone}} exposures {{which are usually}} pale in colour, the exposures at Drumbally Hill <b>are</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> red-brown <b>colour.</b> This colouration signifies that the rock had been altered since it was originally deposited, most likely by groundwater. The limestone rock at Drumbally Hill was formed as a lime mud onn the floor <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shallow, tropical sea. Its proximity to a shoreline resulted in quartz sant grains and pebbles becoming embedded into the mud leaving a large amount than what is usual {{for the majority of}} limestone.|$|R

The Chinese Union Version refers to this stone as being a ruby.|$|R

The jacket lining evolved to <b>be</b> <b>of</b> different coloured material, then of specific hues. Accordingly when the material was turned back on itself: the cuffs, lapels and tails of the jacket exposed the contrasting colours of the lining or facings, enabling ready visual distinction of different units: regiments, divisions or battalions each with their own specific and prominent <b>colours.</b> While <b>a</b> popular practice in 18th century armies, the use <b>of</b> facings <b>was</b> especially observed and elaborated on during the Napoleonic Wars.|$|R
2500|$|This rule {{is perhaps}} most often {{violated}} by a chief, leading some commentators to question whether the rule should apply to a chief, or even whether a chief {{should be considered a}} charge at all rather than <b>a</b> division <b>of</b> the field. [...] These violations usually occur in the case of landscape heraldry and augmentations. [...] French civic heraldry, with its frequent chiefs of France (i.e. [...] "on a field azure, three fleurs-de-lys or", alternatively [...] "azure, seme-de-lys or"), often violates this rule when the field <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>colour.</b> The coat <b>of</b> arms that appears on the famous tapestry of the Lady with the Unicorn was attributed until now by specialistes to the older branch and to the chief of the family Le Viste, Jean IV Le Viste, but it blatantly breaks the rules <b>of</b> French Heraldry. <b>A</b> new study <b>of</b> the tapestry suggests the probability of the intervention <b>of</b> <b>a</b> descendant <b>of</b> the younger branch, Antoine II Le Viste, as <b>a</b> sponsor <b>of</b> the tapestry, and indicates that the incorrect superposition <b>of</b> <b>colours</b> could have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> deliberated choice intended to apprise the observer in an excplicit manner that he was faced with the familiar phenomenon of the modifications of the arms by <b>a</b> mark <b>of</b> cadency. The arms of Harvard Law School, [...] "on a field azure, a chief gules", is another example.

50|$|Each {{player has}} four conical, or hat, shaped playing pieces {{all of the}} same colour that start off in their home 'base'. The object is {{to move out of}} your base, capture, or 'cop', your opponent's pieces by landing on top of them, carry them back to your base, and 'imprison' them there. A player can have any number of pieces out of their base at any time. However, while you are moving back to 'base' with a {{captured}} piece other players may in turn capture your piece. The winner is the last player to have an uncaptured piece.

50|$|Each year, {{new designs}} of the Sigg bottle {{are added to}} the {{collection}} while others are no longer produced. The design of Sigg bottle has led to its addition to the permanent design collection of the New York Museum of Modern Art. The classic bottle <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single <b>colour</b> (most often red) whilst more modern bottles can have designs on them and are available in both glossy or matte finishes. Special editions include those made specifically for English band Radiohead's tour in 2008.

In 2009, Sigg partnered with Original Wraps to provide fully customizable water bottles using Avery Dennison Vinyl.|$|R
5|$|In the First World War, firing and {{observation}} positions were hand-painted in disruptive patterns by artists known as camoufleurs, and they sometimes varied their patterns seasonally. Uniforms <b>were</b> largely <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single <b>colour,</b> {{such as the}} British khaki; but snow camouflage clothes came into use in some armies by 1917. For example, Austro-Hungarian troops on the Italian front used skis and wore snow camouflage smocks and overtrousers over their uniforms, and improvised white cloths over their uniform caps.|$|R

50|$|Casuariidae <b>is</b> {{the family}} <b>of</b> the {{northern}} cassowary.

This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{confirmation}} <b>of</b> what <b>is</b> already visible with the naked eye on this strip of paint, and which makes the most significant addition to our current knowledge of the palette of the underlying painting—that the wall is painted with <b>a</b> simple mixture <b>of</b> lead white and bone black, and <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cool grey <b>colour.</b> This finding will contribute to the updating <b>of</b> <b>an</b> already proposed <b>colour</b> reconstruction image of Magritte’s La pose enchantée [4, 18].|$|R
50|$|Crayfish {{are also}} found in many rivers, {{especially}} those that are swift running and well oxygenated. A crayfish, locally known as the bétangue, is endemic to Mauritius. It is easily recognized by its pincers, one being {{much bigger than the}} other. It <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> brownish-orange <b>colour</b> and can reach <b>a</b> size <b>of</b> 10 cm. It has nocturnal habits and is becoming very rare. Another variety is the chevrette sonz. It <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smaller size and has thin pincers. A third variety is the camaron. It is light-blue and the male is longer than the female, although the latter <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bigger girth. Its size can sometimes exceed 30 cm (pincers included). After hatching, the larvae of most crayfish go to live in the sea, and swim back to the river when they reach adult stage. This migration is often done against fast moving currents, and crayfish have been observed to climb waterfalls by clinging on rocks.|$|R
500|$|The first {{introduction}} of drab general uniform {{was by the}} British Corps of Guides in India in 1848. Initially the drab uniform was specially imported from England, {{with one of the}} reasons being to [...] "make them invisible in <b>a</b> land <b>of</b> dust". However, when a larger quantity was required the army improvised, using a local dye to produce uniform locally. This type of drab uniform soon became known as khaki (Urdu for dusty, soil-coloured) by the Indian soldiers, and <b>was</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> similar <b>colour</b> to <b>a</b> local dress <b>of</b> cotton coloured with the mazari palm. The example was followed by other British units during the mutiny of 1857, dying their white drill uniforms to inconspicuous tones with mud, tea, coffee or coloured inks. The resulting hue varied from dark or slate grey through light brown to off-white, or sometimes even lavender. This improvised measure gradually became widespread among the troops stationed in India and North-West Frontier, and sometimes among the troops campaigning on the African continent.|$|R

Oocysts are spherical to sub-spherical, 15. 9 x 14. 6 μm (range 14 - 17 x 14 - 17. 7). The wall <b>is</b> <b>of</b> two layers: <b>an</b> outer, thicker one which <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> brownish-yellow <b>colour</b> and striated (pitted), and an inner one which is thin and colourless.

Sporocysts 8. 4 x 5. 3 μm (range 6. 25 - 9 x 4 - 6) with inconspicuous Stieda and substiedal bodies. Endogenous stages are intracytoplasmic in the epithelial cells of the small intestine, above the host-cell nucleus. Stages of merogony and gametogony are described.

40|$|Morphometric {{analysis}} {{was carried out}} on wing muscles of the House Fly (Musca domestica), ranging from the pupation period to death. In the first week a clear increase {{was found in the}} percentage of food reserve consumed by the cell components. Both fibrils and sarcosomes increase in circumference during the first week. The sarcosomes then fuse. After the first week few changes occur. The sarcosomal volume increases in male flies. No disintegration or degeneration of the muscle cells appears with old age. Even the fact that the wing of the male flies exhibits abrasion earlier than that <b>of</b> females cannot <b>be</b> correlated with changes in the wing muscles. The ratio of fibrils to sarcosomes is greater than two to one. This ratio differs in males and females. A gradual {{decrease in the number of}} cristae per sarcosome was observed during ageing. This can influence the total activity of the sarcosome. The succinate dehydrogenase reaction is not dependent on age. The presence of two types <b>of</b> sarcosomes <b>is</b> unlikely.
