Unknown to the intruders, Commander Tucker is still conscious and makes his way to Engineering and uses the ship's sensors to monitor the aliens as they plunder the ship.|$|E
5|$|Becca becomes hurt upon {{realising}} that Bradley and Stacey {{are getting}} married. While they are away {{at their own}} wedding, Becca steals a hairbrush with Archie's hair from The Queen Victoria, intending to have a DNA test done on Stacey's baby to prove if it is really Archie's. However, she has doubts and goes back with Stacey to return the brush, but is caught by Ronnie. Becca coerces Stacey to confess Archie raped her and the baby is his. However, Ronnie tells Stacey that Archie underwent an operation {{a few years back}} that left him infertile, meaning that Stacey's baby isn't his. Roxy accuses Ronnie of murdering Archie. Ronnie denies it, but tells her she found out about the rape, and that Archie once raped her. Peggy tells the two of them that when Archie was murdered, she found him lying on the floor, took her divorce papers from the bar and left him to die. Phil tells Peggy about his alibi, the shirt and that he found Archie dead on Christmas Day. Shirley then returns and says Phil has got away <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> she has not told the police anything. Meanwhile, Becca anonymously reports to the police that Bradley had a motive for the murder.|$|E

5|$|The chased hare {{will then}} run at around 40–45km/h (24–26mph) {{and the course}} will last around 35–40seconds over 0.5km (0.3 miles). The greyhounds which pursue the hare will, being faster, start to catch up <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> <b>As</b> greyhounds are much larger than hares but less agile, they find it {{difficult}} to follow the hares' sharp turns which they make to evade the dogs. This agility gives the hare an important and often crucial advantage as it seeks to escape. Under some coursing club rules, the dogs are awarded points on how many times they can turn the hare, and how closely they force the hare's progress. In the UK, the contest between the greyhounds was usually judged from horseback, and the winning greyhound proceeded to the next round of a knock-out tournament. The 2003 UK coursing season ran from 1 October to 28 February.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} was upgraded to Tropical Storm Florence the next morning. However, outflow {{from the storm}} remained poor as the upper-level low was still interacting with the center of Florence and the storm was still not completely tropical but there was slight improvement. By the afternoon of November 4, Florence completed its transition into a tropical cyclone and deep convection developed, causing the storm to quickly intensity; with winds increasing by 20mph (30km/h) in a 6hour time period. The trend in intensification was forecast to continue and Florence was forecast to become the second hurricane of the season within 12hours. Late on November 4, Florence was upgraded to a hurricane as a solid area of deep convection developed around the center of circulation. An eye feature also appeared on infrared satellite but {{was not associated with}} significant strengthening. Florence slowly intensified as the eye persisted and the structure slightly improved. By the morning of November 6, the eye became less defined and the cloud tops around it warmed. The storm also shifted its foreword motion northward as the trough located to the southeast began to move towards the east, moving the steering currents <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> <b>As</b> the low moved further to the east, steering currents in the area of Florence weakened, leading to the storm stalling late on November 6.|$|E
5|$|In 737, Asad {{launched}} a campaign into the principality of Khuttal, whose rulers had supported the Turgesh and Harith's rebellion. Asad was initially successful, but the Khuttalan regent, Ibn al-Sa'iji, called upon the Turgesh for aid. While the Muslim army was scattered pillaging, the Turgesh khagan Suluk brought his army, allegedly 50,000 strong, from his capital Tokmok into Khuttal within 17 days. Ibn al-Sa'iji, who tried to play both sides off against each other, informed Asad of the Turgesh expedition only shortly before its arrival. Asad had time enough to send ahead his heavy baggage train, laden with the plunder and captives from Khuttal, back south {{under the command of}} Ibrahim ibn Asim al-'Uqayli, accompanied by the contingent from the allied principality of al-Saghaniyan. Asad with the main Muslim army remained behind, but at the arrival of the Turgesh host, Asad's troops broke into a headlong flight for the Oxus, which they managed to reach just ahead of the Turgesh. The crossing of the river was a confused affair, as Asad ordered each of his soldiers to carry across one of the sheep the army had brought <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> provisions. In the end, the sheep had to be abandoned as the pursuing Turgesh attacked the Arab rearguard, composed of the Azdi and Tamimi tribal contingents, on the north bank. As the rear guard was thrown back, Asad's army hurried to cross the river in panic.|$|E
