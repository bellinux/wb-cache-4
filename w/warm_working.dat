40|$|The {{properties}} of ultrahigh carbon steels (UHCS) are {{strongly influenced by}} aluminum additions. Hardness studies of quenched UHCS-Al alloys reveal that the temperature {{for the start of}} transformation increases with increases in aluminum content. It is shown that this change {{is a function of the}} atomic percent of solute and of the valence state when comparisons are made with UHCSs containing silicon and tin as solutes. The thermal expansion of UHCSs with dilute aluminum additions shows no discontinuity in the vicinity of the ferrite-austenite transformation temperature. This is the result of a three phase region of ferrite, carbides and austenite. The slope of the expansion curve is higher in the austenite range than in the ferrite range as a result of the dissolution of carbon in austenite with temperature.

Microstructural observations showed that at low temperatures and high strain rates the flow curves can be explained by localized deformation as a consequence of shear band formation.

40|$|Helium is an {{invaluable}} element {{as it is}} widely used in industry such as cryo-genics and welding due to its unique properties. However, helium shortage is expected in near future because of increasing demand and the anxiety of sup-ply. Consequently, helium production has {{attracted the attention of}} industry. The main source of He is natural gas and extracting it from LNG end-flash is considered as the most promising way of producing crude helium. Thus, many process suppliers have proposed process configurations for this and there are mainly three types of helium extraction process, flashing-based, distillation-based and the integration of flashing and distillation. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to conduct a comparative evaluation of the proposed helium extraction processes for LNG plants and give a guideline for a proper selection. This evaluation was performed by simulating each process through Aspen HYSYS. The simulation result was then analysed, focusing on various criteria. The result indicates that all the helium extraction process studied could ex-tract most of helium contained in feed gas except the Technip Distillation process. Regarding LNG production, the integration of the Re-boiled Distilla-tion and a LNG process gives the lowest LNG production specific power. In terms of fuel gas, only the APCI Distillation process could generate fuel gas having less than 40 mole% N 2, which is upper limit for industrial gas turbines, even with He and thus N 2 rich feed gas. Between others, only the Technip Distillation and the ExxonMobil Integration process could produce liquid N 2 and the amount was enough to be used for further processing of crude helium. Concerning freezing of impurities such as CO 2, the ExxonMobil Integration process displayed an excellent performance, recording the <b>warmest</b> <b>working</b> temperature. When considering complexity, the APCI Distillation process was the simplest one, while the two integration-based processes from Linde and ExxonMobil required a lot of equipment. Finally, economic evaluation showed that all the integrations of each the helium extraction process studied and a LNG plant create more economic value than a LNG plant alone. Nevertheless, the difference was just ca. 1 % with current helium price. The selection of the most suitable helium extraction process for a LNG plant completely depends on the situation as each process possesses its own charac-teristic. Thus, proper technical choices have to be made to achieve a successful helium extraction project. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{earliest}} refrigerants {{used were}} R 40, R 764, R 717, R 290 and R 600 a but these had drawbacks of flammability, toxicity, unpleasant smell {{as well as}} a challenge of leakage through the shaft seals of compressors. In 1931, these were replaced by CFCs and HCFCs due to safety and reliabilty concerns. However in 1986, CFCs and HCFCs were confirmed to have an ozone depleting effect and their use discouraged under the Montreal Protocol. Manufacturers responded to this call by introducing HFCs with no ozone depleting effect. Today, there is immense pressure to shift to natural refrigerants after the discovery that emission of these substances to the atmosphere contributes to atleast 20 % of the greenhouse gas emissions. The use of synthetic refrigerants has led to the breakdown of strastospheric ozone molecules and emission of greenhouse gases to the atmoshere causing global warming and global climate change. Today, there is increasing pressure from legislators, business partners and consumers to seek for new methods to achieve cooling that does not depend on global <b>warming</b> <b>working</b> fluids.   Therefore, companies are tasked to rethink established solutions  and implement environmentally friendly yet economically sensible technologies to seize their individual eco-advantage.   For that matter, the use of refrigerants free of ozone depleting and global warming characteristics in Heating, Ventilating, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration continues to take a central role in measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This study aimed at investigating the application of environmentally friendly solutions in refrigeration applications of Uganda with major emphasis on natural refrigerants. This was accomplished by ascertaining the current status of refrigeration in the country as well as computer simulation modelling of the available systems and comparison of the results with those of recommended systems. A field study was carried out to assess the current status of refrigeration in the country i. e refrigerants used and the type of systems currently in use. It was found that synthetic refrigerants predominate and the systems currently installed are single stage, vapor compression. Operating parameters of these systems were then measured and models of these systems developed using EES software and their efficiencies determined. Furthermore, models were developed and proposed  for each sector using an appropriate natural refrigerant and efficiencies determined. Comparisons were then made with installed systems and it was found that natural refrigerants offer a promising solution in the refrigeration applications of Uganda and should be adopted for energy, safety and environmental issues. However, for this transition to be realized, there is need to create awareness in industry as well as the government taking the lead {{in the development of a}} phase out plan with support from industry and research institutions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is {{the injury}} {{as the result}} of {{compression}} of the median nerve by the swollen muscle and soft tissues at carpal tunnel. This condition is causing pain and making the nerve’s signal transmissions are slower. The muscle and soft tissues are swollen because of repeated movements and overuse so they don’t have enough times for recovery. The muscle and tissues also press the blood flow which supplies oxygen and rich nutrient for them and make them swell. CTS will be worse if the tunnel is smaller because of terrible wrist’s posture, and if the blood flow is slower which because of cold hand. The symptoms of CTS are pain, tingling, cold, and weak hand. Therapy and surgery can not totally heal this injury so it is much better to prevent it. For reducing the risk of CTS, some actions can be done, for example making the hands always in a normal temperature or warm so the velocity of blood flow will be stable. Today, there is a product called fingerless gloves to keep hands warm but they are not really convenient so in this research another product is designed, which is thermal-insulating mouse pad. In this study, an experiment is designed to prove that thermal-insulating mouse pad is working effectively. The experiment is done at climatic chamber with 40 students as respondents.
