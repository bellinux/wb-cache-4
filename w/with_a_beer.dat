5|$|Carrington and Johnson {{speculated that}} Leigh was {{assaulted}} {{by the group}} of boys after returning from the beach, as punishment for complaining about being raped, and was murdered by Webster and two others {{because they were afraid}} she would tell other people. They refused to specifically name the two other suspects for fear of legal repercussions, though clarified that one had sexually assaulted Leigh earlier in the night, and the other likely sexually assaulted her <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>beer</b> bottle before she died, as punishment for publicly refusing to have sex with him. Webster talked to the media about the murder {{for the first time in}} 1997, and insisted that he acted alone in killing Leigh.|$|E

25|$|It {{used to be}} {{a common}} {{occurrence}} at the end of cricket Test matches for the crowd to invade the pitch to watch the presentation from the pavilion balcony. In the UK this tradition ended in 2001 Natwest Series after a steward was injured in a pitch invasion at a one-day match between England and Pakistan. Invading the pitch can now warrant a £1,000 fine, and post-match presentations are held on the field.

25|$|During this time, David Ruffin began {{following}} the group around as he aspired {{to join the}} group. During a local Detroit performance, Ruffin joined the group onstage and impressed the group with his vocal talent and dancing skills. Following that same time, Al Bryant had grown frustrated with the group's lack of success and became restless and uncooperative, preferring the mundane routine of his day job as a milkman over the rigors of rehearsal and performing. After a heated quarrel with Paul and hitting {{him in the head}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>beer</b> bottle following a disastrous performance at the 1963 Motown company Christmas/New Years Eve party, Bryant was summarily fired from the group. As a result, David Ruffin was brought in as his replacement in January 1964. Though Ruffin's brother, Jimmy was also considered for the slot, David was selected following his performance with them in 1963.|$|E
25|$|Cask ale in pubs {{is usually}} served <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>beer</b> engine or handpump, {{which is used}} to siphon the beer from the cellar. The beer engine is a , {{sometimes}} , airtight piston chamber; pulling down on the handle raises the piston which drags up a half pint of beer. When a cask is first tapped into the beer engine, or after the lines have been washed through, the pump needs to be pulled several times to clear the lines of air or water. The line will continue to hold beer, which will tend to go stale overnight, so the first beer of the day pulled through will be thrown away. Most pubs will pull through at least a pint of beer on each beer engine before they open, while others will wait for the first order of beer on that pump. Experienced bar staff will serve a pint with long, smooth, slow pulls of the pump handle, plus a short final pull to make sure the glass is full.|$|E
25|$|On March 18 at Victory Road, Sting was {{defeated}} by Roode in a non-title No Holds Barred match. On the following edition of Impact Wrestling, Sting announced his resignation from the general manager position, and handed the position over to Hulk Hogan. He later stated that he believe that Hogan could properly run TNA without the influence of Bischoff. On March 29, Dixie Carter announced that Borden had signed another contract extension with TNA. Sting returned to TNA on the May 24 episode of Impact Wrestling, attacking Bobby Roode. The following week, Sting defeated Roode in a non-title lumberjack match to earn a shot at his TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On June 10 at Slammiversary, Sting was announced as the first person inducted into the TNA Hall of Fame the following October. Later, in the main event of the evening, Sting unsuccessfully challenged Roode for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, after being hit <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>beer</b> bottle. Afterwards, Sting attacked Roode and dropped him on the entrance ramp with a Scorpion Death Drop.|$|E

25|$|Dahmer then brandished a {{knife and}} {{informed}} Edwards he intended to take nude pictures of him. In an attempt to appease Dahmer, Edwards unbuttoned his shirt, saying he {{would allow him to}} do so if he would remove the handcuffs and put the knife away. In response to this promise, Dahmer simply turned his attention towards the TV; Edwards observed Dahmer rocking back and forth and chanting before turning his attention back to him: he placed his head on Edwards' chest, listened to his heartbeat and, with the knife pressed against his intended victim, informed Edwards he intended to eat his heart. In continuous attempts to prevent Dahmer from attacking him, Edwards repeated that he was Dahmer's friend and {{that he was not going}} to run away. (Edwards had decided he was going to either jump from a window or run through the unlocked front door upon the next available opportunity.) When Edwards next stated he needed to use the bathroom, he asked if they could sit <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>beer</b> in the living room, where there was air conditioning, to which Dahmer consented, and the pair walked to the living room when Edwards exited the bathroom. Inside the living room, Edwards waited until he observed Dahmer have a momentary lapse of concentration before requesting to use the bathroom again. When Edwards rose from the couch, he noted Dahmer was not holding the handcuffs, whereupon Edwards punched him in the face, knocking Dahmer off balance, and ran out the front door.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented here}} {{focuses on the}} influence of background music on the beer-tasting experience. An experiment is reported in which different groups of customers tasted <b>a</b> <b>beer</b> under three different conditions (N = 231). The control group was presented <b>with</b> <b>an</b> unlabeled <b>beer,</b> the second group <b>with</b> <b>a</b> labeled <b>beer,</b> and the third group <b>with</b> <b>a</b> labeled <b>beer</b> together <b>with</b> <b>a</b> customized sonic cue (a short clip from an existing song). In general, the beer-tasting experience was rated as more enjoyable with music than when the tasting was conducted in silence. In particular, those who were familiar with the band that had composed the song, liked the beer more after having tasted it while listening to the song, than those who knew the band, but only saw the label while tasting. These results provide support for the idea that customized sound-tasting experiences can complement the process of developing novel beverage (and presumably also food) events. Here we also suggest that involving musicians and researchers alongside brewers in the process of <b>beer</b> development, offers <b>an</b> interesting model for future development. Finally, we discuss the role of attention in sound-tasting experiences, and the importance that a positive hedonic reaction towards a song can have for the ensuing tasting experience...|$|R

500|$|The lyrical {{process was}} a {{collaborative}} effort consisting of Vinnie, Darrell, and Lachman. Themes explored on the album included the brothers' experiences, Darrell commented, [...] "the crumbling of one empire and then starting over... So {{there are a lot}} of lyrics about being reborn in a sense, about it being a new day, moving forward, letting go of the past and becoming something new." [...] This is exemplified in the songs [...] "Reborn", [...] "Wake up", and [...] "Breathing New Life". [...] "Blunt Force Trauma" [...] is about when someone or something comes up behind you when you least expect it, [...] "it could be a situation in your life, it could be a person you know <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>beer</b> bottle".|$|E

[...] While Colbert accepted his apology, Stewart continued and asked why Colbert had initially responded by shoving a recycling bin over Stewart's head and hitting him with a baseball bat. [...] To which Colbert replied, [...] "No, no, Jon—I shoved a recycling bin over your head and encouraged Conan to hit you with a baseball bat," [...] and, as usual, left Stewart confused. [...] At {{the end of the}} segment, Stewart asked Colbert: [...] "Did we win that , by the way?" [...] Colbert's answer was, [...] "I think America won, Jon." ...|$|E
500|$|Leave Home has various lyrical themes {{throughout}} its track list. The opening song, [...] "Glad to See You Go", is rather uptempo and frenetic. The track was about Dee Dee's then-girlfriend Connie, who {{was well known}} in the punk rock scene as having once dated New York Dolls bassist Arthur Kane and attempting to cut his finger off with a knife. Connie also harmed Dee Dee in several ways, such as slicing his buttocks <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>beer</b> bottle. At the time, every other member of the band despised Dee Dee's girlfriend and he eventually broke up with her. Joey recalls: [...] "Dee [...] and I came up with the song 'Glad to See You Go,' about Connie's leaving." [...] In the mid-1980s, Connie died from a drug overdose. [...] "Gimme Gimme Shock Treatment" [...] utilizes Joey's singing abilities with its vocal-demanding melody. Author Scott Schinder called the song a [...] "sing-along mental-illness ode." [...] The next song, [...] "I Remember You" [...] was said by author Greil Marcus to be all about the moment where [...] "Joey's voice turns the single word [...] "you" [...] into pure poetry." [...] "Oh, Oh, I Love Her So" [...] pays homage to the 1950s doo-wop genre, and consists of a three-chord barrage. The song was written solely by Joey, where in the song he humorously tells of how he met a girl at Burger King and they fell in love by a soda machine.|$|E

He used the radio as an alter ego; a guy with a swaggering bravado.

2500|$|Fellow Australian music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, noted [...] "Seymour's {{themes of}} {{alienation}} and sexual politics {{came to the}} fore" [...] with this album.
