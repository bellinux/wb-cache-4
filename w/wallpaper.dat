5|$|The Dillon Drawing Room, {{which was}} {{originally}} {{known as the}} Lee Drawing Room, was renamed in honor of former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury C. Douglas Dillon, who donated its unique <b>wallpaper,</b> a Chinese print from 1770. Dillon's wife Phyllis purchased the <b>wallpaper</b> {{on the recommendation of}} interior designer Eleanor Brown in 1964. The <b>wallpaper</b> was removed and refurbished between 1982 and 1988. The room is furnished with 18th century English pieces, along with Chinese vases from the Ming and Qing (Kangxi reign) dynasties. The Dillon Drawing Room is used by resident heads of state and chiefs of government to formally receive visitors.|$|E
5|$|Tilings with {{translational}} symmetry in {{two independent}} directions {{can be categorized}} by <b>wallpaper</b> groups, of which 17 exist. It has been claimed that all seventeen of these groups are represented in the Alhambra palace in Granada, Spain. Though this is disputed, the variety and sophistication of the Alhambra tilings have surprised modern researchers. Of the three regular tilings two are in the p6m <b>wallpaper</b> group and one is in p4m. Tilings in 2D with translational symmetry in just one direction can be categorized by the seven frieze groups describing the possible frieze patterns. Orbifold notation {{can be used to}} describe <b>wallpaper</b> groups of the Euclidean plane.|$|E

40|$|Mould {{germination}} and {{the growth}} rate on <b>wallpapers</b> with different physical properties and the surface structures Seung Ho Ryu and Hyeun Jun Moon Mould infestation problems in building are a complex phenomenon involving various causes such as environmental conditions, substrates, exposure time, and so on. The physical properties of building materials, e. g. surface structure, can be a key factor for mould germination and growth. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the influence of the hygroscopic properties and surface structures of the wall-papers on the mould growth. An experimental study was conducted to characterize the hygroscopic properties and surface structures of the <b>wallpapers.</b> Four types of <b>wallpapers</b> with low chemical emis-sions were selected in order to exclude influence on chemicals on mould germination. Cross sections of the selected <b>wallpapers</b> were observed in order to characterize the surface structure of <b>wallpapers</b> using the scanning electron microscope. Three different fungi species were inoculated on the <b>wallpapers,</b> and mould growth on the selected <b>wallpapers</b> were observed for about two weeks. The results showed that the <b>wallpapers</b> with irregular patterns or a flat surface structure could delay mould growth. <b>Wallpapers</b> with higher moisture sorption capability would limit the development of mould growth under the experimental condition. Our study has shown a clear correlation between the mould growth rate and hygroscopic properties of the <b>wallpapers...</b>|$|R

5|$|Written by Joseph Lidster. A story idea {{considered}} for {{the third and fourth}} episodes of the fourth series. It was based upon the notion of 'faces' which people {{used to be able to}} see in patterned <b>wallpaper.</b> While redecorating, one of the Bannerman Road gang was to strip some paint off a wall and reveal old <b>wallpaper</b> underneath. Faces would appear on the wallpaper; these would be aliens from another dimension trying to arrive on Earth, literally taking shape in walls and stepping through. It was noted that this notion could be adapted for patterns in wooden floors and doors.|$|E

Some have a central medallion, and some have a border in a frieze group. Many Chinese lattices have been analysed mathematically by Daniel S.

5|$|Many {{traditional}} rugs, whether pile carpets or flatweave kilims, {{are divided}} into a central field and a framing border; both can have symmetries, though in handwoven carpets these are often slightly broken by small details, variations of pattern and shifts in colour introduced by the weaver. In kilims from Anatolia, the motifs used are themselves usually symmetrical. The general layout, too, is usually present, with arrangements such as stripes, stripes alternating with rows of motifs, and packed arrays of roughly hexagonal motifs. The field is commonly laid out as a <b>wallpaper</b> with a <b>wallpaper</b> group such as pmm, while the border may be laid out as a frieze of frieze group pm11, pmm2 or pma2. Turkish and Central Asian kilims often have three or more borders in different frieze groups. Weavers certainly had the intention of symmetry, without explicit knowledge of its mathematics.|$|E

5|$|Between 1847 and 1850, when Blore was {{building}} the new east wing, the Brighton Pavilion {{was once again}} plundered of its fittings.
