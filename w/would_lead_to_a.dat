5|$|From 1589 Zamoyski, in {{his role}} as the hetman, tried to prevent the intensifying Tatar incursions along the Commonwealth {{south-eastern}} border, but with little success. In order to deal with the recurring disturbances in that region Zamoyski developed a plan to turn Moldavia into a buffer zone between the Commonwealth and the Ottoman Empire; this <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lengthy campaign.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the Armoured Directorate of the Red Army (ABTU RKKA) {{ordered the}} {{development}} of a new conical turret for the T-26 similar to the BT-7's turret and to arm it with the 76.2mm L-10 tank gun. Engineers of the Factory No. 174 felt it was impossible to implement this project because it <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> significant overload of T-26's chassis.|$|E
5|$|A snap {{election}} was called, with Bruce taking {{his case to}} the people that dramatic action on industrial relations was needed. Opposition Leader Scullin forcefully attacked the government, blaming the Prime Minister for an industrial environment that was adversarial and punitive, stressing that Commonwealth arbitration had safeguarded many rights of workers and was completely workable with conciliation and proper consultation. Scullin also criticised the government for the growing debt problem and economic malaise, which for some years he had predicted <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> major economic crisis.|$|E

It can be stated that higher adoption of IRVs <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> increase in rice yield and rural farmers could, consequently, have marketable surplus. It this is marketed it <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> increase in household income and by extension generate improvement in household’s welfare.|$|R
5|$|After the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries had {{abandoned}} the coalition and increasingly viewed the Bolsheviks as traitors to the revolution. In July 1918, the Left Socialist Revolutionary Yakov Grigorevich Blumkin assassinated the German ambassador to Russia, Wilhelm von Mirbach, hoping that the ensuing diplomatic incident <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> relaunched revolutionary war against Germany. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries then launched a coup in Moscow, shelling the Kremlin and seizing the city's central post office before being stopped by Trotsky's forces. The party's leaders and many members were arrested and imprisoned, but were treated more leniently than other opponents of the Bolsheviks.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the {{difficulties}} in raising capital for these expansions and despite MIT's privately endowed status, Walker {{and other members of}} the Corporation lobbied the Massachusetts legislature for a $200,000 grant to aid in the industrial development of the Commonwealth ($ in 2016 dollars). After intensive negotiations that called upon Walker's extensive connections and civic experience, in 1887 the legislature made a grant of $300,000 over two years to the Institute, which <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> total of $1.6 million in grants from the Commonwealth before the practice was discontinued in 1921.|$|E
5|$|On the June 30 {{episode of}} Raw, Swagger turned {{face for the}} first time in WWE, after he and Colter would confront Rusev and Lana about them disrespecting America. This <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> number of matches between the two, with Swagger being {{defeated}} by Rusev at both Battleground and SummerSlam. On the December 1 episode of Raw, Swagger would find Colter beaten up in a corridor, with Rusev later admitting to the attack. At , Swagger would challenge Rusev for the United States Championship, in a losing effort and ending their feud.|$|E

5|$|The Representatives' Centralization's {{relationship}} to the SPD was ambivalent. The organization was allied with the SPD and supported the Erfurt Program. At the same time, the party mostly opposed {{the founding of the}} Representatives' Centralization and called upon its members to rejoin the centralized trade unions. The FVdG remained affiliated with the SPD, which in turn tolerated it because the SPD was afraid a split <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> large loss of members. The FVdG stated it would rejoin the centralized trade unions like the SPD leadership desired only if the centralized unions accepted the FVdG's organizational principles.|$|E
5|$|The {{permissive}} attitude toward business {{did not always}} extend toward large corporations. A lack of venture capital in the state became a significant problem with the early industry. Civic and business leaders, and even ordinary citizens, worried that the influx of capital from outside the state <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> loss of political power, revenue, and business opportunities. This sentiment led {{to a series of}} antitrust lawsuits by the state Attorney General starting in 1906. The lawsuits easily succeeded and limited the ability of outside investors, most notably Standard Oil, to gain control of the state oil companies.|$|E
5|$|A {{supporter}} of the evangelical wing of the Church of England, Wilberforce believed that the revitalisation of the Church and individual Christian observance <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> harmonious, moral society. He sought to elevate the status of religion {{in public and private}} life, making piety fashionable in both the upper- and middle-classes of society. To this end, in April 1797, Wilberforce published , on which he had been working since 1793. This was an exposition of New Testament doctrine and teachings and a call for a revival of Christianity, {{as a response to the}} moral decline of the nation, illustrating his own personal testimony and the views which inspired him. The book proved to be influential and a best-seller by the standards of the day; 7,500copies were sold within six months, and it was translated into several languages.|$|E

5|$|Building a {{complete}} deployment {{would have been}} extremely expensive, {{on the order of}} the total yearly budget of the Department of Defense. Robert McNamara, the Secretary of Defense, felt the cost could not be justified and worried it <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> further nuclear arms race. He directed the teams to consider deployments where a limited number of interceptors might still be militarily useful. Among these, the I-67 concept suggested building a lightweight defense against very limited attacks. When the People's Republic of China exploded their first H-bomb in 1967, I-67 was promoted as a defense against a Chinese attack, and this system became Sentinel in October. Nike-X development, in its original form, ended.|$|E
5|$|During the study, various {{accusations of}} foul play by or unsuitability of both {{submarine}} designers were made by Australian politicians and the media. These included claims that the similar left-wing political leanings of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Swedish Social Democratic Party, both in power at the time, <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> pro-Kockums bias, investigations into perceived coaching of IDL/HDW representatives in the questions to be asked at an ALP Caucus briefing session on the project, and public emphasis on security incidents in both Sweden and West Germany. These incidents either lacked supporting evidence or were proven false, and {{were the result of}} the Liberal Party attempting to discredit the Labor government, or pro-British politicians and organisations who believed both submarines were inferior to the Vickers Type 2400offering.|$|E
5|$|His next fight {{took place}} on January 7, 2006 at Madison Square Garden in New York City against Carlos Baldomir. For Judah, the fight {{was viewed as a}} tuneup bout that <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lucrative bout between Judah and WBC Light Welterweight Champion Floyd Mayweather, Jr., which was {{tentatively}} scheduled for April. Judah entered the fight as a 10-to-1 favorite over Baldomir. The stage was set when Judah unsportingly punched Baldomir on the thigh during the prefight introductions instead of touching gloves to show sportsmanship. The early rounds of the fight were close, but as the rounds passed, Judah was doing less than necessary to win, while Baldomir kept applying pressure on Judah. In round seven, Judah was hurt by a right hand and Baldomir landed a series of right hands to Judah's head along the ropes during the tenth round. Baldomir defeated Judah by unanimous decision with scores of 115–113, 114–113 and 115–112 from the three judges.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, the Senators {{would sign}} Daigle to a $12.25 million contract, the largest rookie salary in League history, which <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cap on rookie {{contracts}} {{a few years}} later. The club would promote Daigle over Alexei Yashin, nominating Daigle for {{rookie of the year}} over Yashin. His play did not justify full-time status and in 1995, coaches Rick Bowness and Alain Vigneault demoted Daigle to part-time status. The move led to Bowness and Vigneault being fired. In the end, Daigle did not come close to the career the Senators hoped for. After scoring only 74 goals in just over four seasons, he was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers, and is widely {{regarded as one of the}} biggest draft busts in sports history.|$|E
5|$|In October 1998, Milošević and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke {{reached an}} {{agreement}} to temporarily end the fighting, whereby Yugoslavia would halve the amount of troops and police personnel stationed in Kosovo. The agreement came after Holbrooke convinced the KLA to consider negotiations with Belgrade, while making it clear to Milošević that failing to find a peaceful solution to the conflict <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> NATO bombing campaign against Serbia. The agreement required Yugoslavia to let Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM) observers enter Kosovo {{to ensure that the}} Yugoslavs were abiding by their commitment to withdraw thousands of soldier and police officers from the province. Small-scale clashes continued, and by December, over 1,000 people had been killed and more than 300,000 displaced in the fighting.|$|E
5|$|In his {{newspaper}} Berliner Arbeiterzeitung (Berlin Workers Newspaper), Gregor Strasser was {{highly critical of}} Goebbels' failure to attract the urban vote. However, the party as a whole did much better in rural areas, attracting as much as 18 per cent {{of the vote in}} some regions. This was partly because Hitler had publicly stated just prior to the election that Point 17 of the party programme, which mandated the expropriation of land without compensation, would apply only to Jewish speculators and not private landholders. After the election, the party refocused their efforts to try to attract still more votes in the agricultural sector. In May, shortly after the election, Hitler considered appointing Goebbels as party propaganda chief. But he hesitated, as he worried that the removal of Gregor Strasser from the post <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> split in the party. Goebbels considered himself well suited to the position, and began to formulate ideas about how propaganda could be used in schools and the media.|$|E

5|$|Kotarou becomes {{disillusioned with}} Guardian's tactics {{and returns to}} Kazamatsuri where he meets Kagari again. She tells him she must {{initiate}} re-evolution, but since this <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> dead world, Kagari must find good memories brought out through the betterment of life on Earth, as opposed to bad memories caused by war and conflict. Kotarou agrees to help her and he acts as a double agent, demolishing Gaia's and Guardian's infrastructure in Kazamatsuri and killing those on either side. Kazamatsuri is partly destroyed when Gaia attempts to force Kagari to initiate re-evolution, but Kotarou manages to stop this from occurring. As a result, Kagari praises Kotarou and shows gratitude for showing her satisfactory memories. Kotarou unwillingly stabs Kagari, and after a kiss, they evolve into an orb of light inside a tree.|$|E
5|$|Natalya lasted {{the rest}} of the year {{competing}} in various matches, including a number one contender's battle royal for Nikki Bella's Divas Championship, on the April 13 episode of Raw, which was won by Paige. On the April 9 episode of Smackdown, Natalya defeated Alicia Fox. Post-match, she and Fox were attacked by the special guest referee for the match Cameron, which <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> triple–threat match the following week, with Cameron coming out victorious. On June 7, WWE announced that Kidd had suffered a severe neck/spinal injury after receiving Samoa Joe's 'Muscle buster' finishing maneuver during a dark match on Raw six days prior, and several weeks later, Kidd announced that he would be out of action for over a year, with Natalya been taken off television for the very first time in order to care of Kidd and with the Kidd/Cesaro tag team being ended.|$|E
5|$|On the {{top right}} corner of the model for a surface weather map is the {{pressure}}, showing the last two integer digits of the pressure in millibars, or hectopascals, along with the first decimal. For instance, if the pressure at a certain location is 999.7hPa, the pressure portion of the station model will read 997. Although the first digit or two of the pressure is left off, other nearby stations give away whether the pressure starts with a 10 or a 9. Most of the time, choosing first digits that <b>would</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> value nearest to 1000 works out best. The plotting of this value within the station model allows for the analysis of isobars on weather maps. Within maps which plot data on constant pressure surfaces, the pressure is replaced with the height of the pressure surface.|$|E
