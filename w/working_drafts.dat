2500|$|On the one hand, the {{surviving}} texts of Aristotle do not derive from finished literary texts, but rather from <b>working</b> <b>drafts</b> used within Aristotle's school, as opposed, {{on the other}} hand, to the dialogues and other [...] "exoteric" [...] texts which Aristotle published more widely during his lifetime. The consensus is that Andronicus of Rhodes collected the esoteric works of Aristotle's school which existed {{in the form of}} smaller, separate works, distinguished them from those of Theophrastus and other Peripatetics, edited them, and finally compiled them into the more cohesive, larger works as they are known today.|$|E

40|$|Comments on the <b>working</b> <b>draft</b> of OSHA {{regulations}} governing excavations, trenching, and shoring {{practices in}} the construction industry (SIC- 1540) are provided. The comments arose from five regional industry workshops which were held to discuss construction practices in excavations and to review the <b>working</b> <b>draft</b> regulations. The document is intended to {{serve as the basis for}} further OSHA development of recommended standards and to serve industry as a resource document for the development of a voluntary consensus standard. Each page of the first section contains the text of the <b>working</b> <b>draft,</b> comments pertaining to this text, and resulting recommendations. An explanation of the recommendations is included. The draft regulations contain sections devoted to: general protection requirements; specific excavation requirements; specific shoring, shielding, and sloping requirements; specific trenching requirements and definitions of pertinent terms such as negotiable slope, spaced sheeting, and standard practice.

40|$|Telomeres are {{the ends}} of linear {{eukaryotic}} chromosomes. To ensure that no large stretches of uncharacterized DNA remain between {{the ends of}} the human <b>working</b> <b>draft</b> sequence and the ends of each chromosome, we would need to connect the sequences of the telomeres to the <b>working</b> <b>draft</b> sequence. But telomeres have an unusual DNA sequence composition and organization that makes them particularly difficult to isolate and analyse. Here we use specialized linear yeast artificial chromosome clones, each carrying a large telomere-terminal fragment of human DNA, to integrate most human telomeres with the <b>working</b> <b>draft</b> sequence. Subtelomeric sequence structure appears to vary widely, mainly as a result of large differences in subtelomeric repeat sequence abundance and organization at individual telomeres. Many subtelomeric regions appear to be gene-rich, matching both known and unknown expressed genes. This indicates that human subtelomeric regions are not simply buffers of nonfunctional 'junk DNA' next to the molecular telomere, but are instead functional parts of the expressed genome...|$|R
