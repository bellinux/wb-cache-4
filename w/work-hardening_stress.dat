40|$|A {{statistical}} model is proposed {{to account for}} strength anomalies in L 12 alloys. It {{is based on a}} competition between locking of superdislocations into Kear Wilsdorf locks and by-passing these locks by macrokinks. From the statistical distribution of macrokink heights, it is shown that the population of mobile dislocations is exhausted with an increasing efficiency as temperature is raised. This yields either an exhaustion creep at constant applied load, or a strength anomaly in constant strain rate conditions. Several consequences on strain rate sensitivity, <b>work-hardening,</b> or flow <b>stress</b> reversibility are envisaged...|$|R

40|$|Deformation {{behavior}} of cobalt in the fcc phase was studied {{over a wide}} range of strain rates (0. 001 to 1 s(- 1)) and temperatures (600 A degrees C to 950 A degrees C). At the lower temperatures and higher strain rates, a single peak in flow stress followed by softening to steady state was observed, whereas at higher temperatures and lower strain rates, an oscillatory flow stress behavior finally converging to a steady state was observed. Both these represent typical flow stress responses during dynamic recrystallization (DRX). The critical condition for the initiation of DRX was determined by the inflection point in the <b>work-hardening</b> vs <b>stress</b> plot. This critical condition in terms of the work done was found to increase with temperature-compensated strain rate. Electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) revealed that, on quenching after deformation, a certain fraction of the fcc phase was always retained, the extent of retention being higher for smaller grain sizes. Misorientation measurements across boundaries revealed a significant amount of twins in the retained fcc phase. The grain average misorientation (GAM), signifying the misorientation within grains, was found to be inversely related to the twin boundary fractions in the fcc phase...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{deformation}} and dynamic recrystallization (DRX) {{behavior of a}} nickel-based superalloy were investigated by the thermal compression test. The experimental {{results show that the}} process parameters have great influence on the flow stress of the superalloy. In addition, there is an inflection point on the DRX softening stage of the <b>work-hardening</b> rate versus <b>stress</b> curve. DRX under the conditions of higher temperatures and lower strain rates easily occurs when the strain reaches a critical level. Based on the classical dislocation density theory and the DRX kinetics models, a two-stage constitutive model considering the effect of work hardening-dynamic recovery and DRX is developed for the superalloy. Comparisons between the predicted and experimental data indicate that the values predicted by the proposed constitutive model are in good agreement with the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe micro rebound {{hardness}} test is characterized by using a small and hard ball as an impact element and measuring the restitution coefficient of the ball against the test piece as a hardness property of the test piece. In this study, {{in order to determine}} the specifications for the prototype tester presently under development, the features of the restitution coefficient measured by the test were investigated by computer simulation. In the simulation, the impact ball and the test piece were assumed to be an elastic body and an elastic-plastic body, respectively. Through the simulation, the influences of the factors in the impact ball side, Young's modulus, density and hardness, and of the factors in the test piece side, yield <b>stress,</b> <b>work-hardening</b> index, Young's modulus and thickness, on the restitution coefficient, essential for determining the specifications of the tester and important for understanding the {{hardness test}} result, were revealed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the work-hardening behaviors of a rolled AZ 31 B magnesium alloy sheet during in-plane cyclic loading. The overall {{trend of the}} stress–strain curve was as follows. As established before, the yield stress under compression was considerably less than that under tension, and an inflected shape was observed in the stress–strain curve during the subsequent tension. Furthermore, an asymmetric evolution of work-hardening was observed as follows. The rate of work-hardening in the late stage of compression became gradually large {{with an increase in}} the number of cycles. Owing to this increase in the rate of <b>work-hardening,</b> the <b>stress</b> at the end of compression increased as the number of cycles increased. On the other hand, the rate of work-hardening in the late stage of tension became small as the number of cycles increased, yielding a decrease in the stress at the end of tension with the increase in the number of cycles. The results were almost the same when the cyclic loading test was carried out after tensile strain was applied to the sheet. On the other hand, when the cyclic loading test was carried out after compressive strain was applied, the increase in the rate of work-hardening in the late stage of compression was significantly more pronounced, whereas the inflected shape of the curve during tension was considerably less pronounced. The mechanisms of the above macroscopic behaviors were investigated in terms of twinning...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of sound constitutive descriptions {{able to predict}} accurately the changes in flow stress during plastic deformation, under changing temperature and strain rate conditions is of utmost importance for the correct prediction of the mechanical response of metals and alloys, which undergo deformation under hot-working conditions. Therefore, the present work has been conducted {{with the aim of}} developing a constitutive model of such characteristics, able to describe as accurate as possible the changes in flow stress of a commercial 20 MnCr 5 steel, when this material is deformed at elevated temperatures and different strain rates. Particular {{attention has been paid to}} the analysis of the flow <b>stress,</b> <b>work-hardening</b> and work-softening behavior when this material is subjected to transient testing conditions, that is to say, changes in strain rate and deformation temperature in the course of plastic deformation. The constitutive description is initially developed from the analysis of the stress-strain curves obtained from axisymmetric compression tests conducted under nominal constant testing conditions, which involved the deformation of the material at temperatures in the range of 1123 - 1473 K and strain rates of 0. 01 - 10 s− 1, up to effective strains spanning from approximately 0. 6 to 1. The initial work-hardening and the subsequent work-softening behavior exhibited by the material during plastic deformation have been thoroughly characterized on a rational basis. The temperature and strain rate dependence of the yield stress, critical stress for the initiation of dynamic recrystallization, apparent saturation stress and actual steady-state flow stress have been described by means of the Sellars-Tegart-Garofalo model. The time to 50 % dynamic recrystallization has also been described as a function of deformation temperature and strain rate, by means of a simple parametric relationship commonly employed for this purpose. The proposed constitutive description employs a single activation energy, whose value is close to that required for the self-diffusion of Fe in austenite, of approximately 284 kJ mol− 1. Further experiments involving changes in deformation temperature and strain rate have been carried out in order to validate the constitutive model. The results indicate that the proposed approach is able to describe satisfactorily the changes in flow <b>stress,</b> <b>work-hardening</b> and work-softening of the investigated material during transient testing conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{low carbon}} steel of 0. 22 wt % carbon was tested to {{estimate}} the dynamic phase transformation behavior from austenite to ferrite. The samples were deformed at just above Ar 3 temperature by hot torsion at condition of strain rate (0. 5 /sec) and strain (5. 0). The flow curve obtained at just above Ar 3 significantly differed from others due to dynamic transformation. Based on the analysis of flow stress curve and observation of micro-structure evolution, the initiation and finish points of strain induced dynamic transformation (SIDT) could be determined. An inflection point observed at early deformation range (0. 2 – 0. 3) from the <b>work-hardening</b> rate and <b>stress</b> plot meant that new ferrite grains were nucleated in austenite matrix and these nuclei could be also confirmed by optical microscope. Subsequently in strain range of 0. 7 - 1. 0, the flow stress had the maximum value and new fine ferrite grains were dynamically generated inside untransformed austenite grains as well as prior austenite grains. The dynamic phase transformation induced by deformation made eventually fine ferrite grains under 3 ㎛ and decreased stress level with a fixed gradient...|$|R
