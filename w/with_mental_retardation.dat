PhDr. Jan Šiška, Ph. D. ABSTRACT: This thesis {{is focused on}} the employment of people <b>with</b> Mild <b>mental</b> <b>retardation</b> in an IT company particularly related to potential positions and job content. The aim is to identify employment opportunities for people <b>with</b> Mild <b>mental</b> <b>retardation,</b> to define the obstacles and to suggest possible solution for the company. The theoretical basis for the thesis is classification of <b>mental</b> <b>retardation,</b> options to involve people <b>with</b> Mild <b>mental</b> <b>retardation</b> in the work process and rules for employment of people with disabilities on the open labour market. There was used empirical - analytical approach, comparison and semi-structured interview. The outcome of the research is {{that it is impossible to}} hire an employee <b>with</b> Mild <b>mental</b> <b>retardation</b> but a practice can be organized. The recommendation is to setup a strategy for the employment of disabled people and other related measures.
