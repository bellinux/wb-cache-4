5|$|All {{members of}} the Temple must be {{affiliated}} with a pylon, and thus membership is by application, requiring contact with a Setian priestess or priest followed by an evaluation period. The participation of non-initiated in the Temple's rituals are forbidden, due {{to the belief that}} their rituals <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> in the wrong hands.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{had been}} raised that the {{radiation}} belt produced in orbit by the recent Operation Dominic nuclear tests <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> to manned space missions, but an extensive study announced in early September declared that {{it was safe to}} fly. While the outside of the capsule was expected to receive a dosage of around 500 röntgens, the study concluded that shielding and the effect of the spacecraft structure would reduce this to around 8 röntgens experienced by the astronaut, well within established tolerance limits.|$|E
5|$|The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the sport's {{governing}} body, {{refused a}} compromise proposal from Michelin {{to allow a}} chicane to be installed, maintaining that such rule changes would be grossly unfair to the Bridgestone-shod teams, who had come prepared with properly working tyres, and that a last-minute change to the track layout <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> in case of crashes. The Michelin teams, unable {{to come to a}} compromise with the FIA, decided not to participate. It was later stated that the Michelin-shod teams could have potentially exposed themselves to criminal liability under Indiana state law had they competed.|$|E

5|$|Barrichello placed blame upon Frentzen for {{starting}} the lap one accident at the Variante della Roggia corner. He demanded that Frentzen be banned for ten races. Barrichello also added that his helmet was damaged from his collision with de la Rosa. Frentzen reacted {{by suggesting that}} Barrichello braked earlier which forced him {{to make contact with}} teammate Trulli. FIA Race Director Charlie Whiting defended his decision not to stop the race saying that the safety car was deployed as all cars involved were in the run-off areas and that he believed stopping the race <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>dangerous.</b> However, he admitted that he was not aware about Gislimberti's condition when making the decision. Jordan team principal Eddie Jordan believed that Whiting had made the right decision and praised the safety of the modern Formula One car for protecting drivers.|$|E
5|$|For {{security}} reasons, Groves wanted H. K. Ferguson {{to operate}} the new plant, {{but it was a}} closed shop, and security regulations at the Clinton Engineer Works did not allow trade unions. To get around this, H. K. Ferguson created a wholly owned subsidiary, the Fercleve Corporation (from Ferguson of Cleveland), and the Manhattan District contracted it {{to operate the}} plant for $11,000 a month. Operating personnel for the new plant were initially trained at the Philadelphia pilot plant. In August 1944, Groves, Conant and Fox asked ten enlisted men of the Special Engineer Detachment (SED) at Oak Ridge for volunteers, warning that the job <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>dangerous.</b> All ten volunteered. Along with four Fercleve employees, they were sent to Philadelphia to learn about the plant's operation.|$|E
5|$|Further tragedy soon {{followed}} when Victoria's son, George, died of bone cancer the following year. Her granddaughter, Lady Pamela Hicks, remembered her grandmother's tears. In World War II Victoria was bombed out of Kensington Palace, and {{spent some time}} at Windsor Castle with King George VI. Her surviving son, Louis, and two of her grandsons served in the Royal Navy, while her German relations fought with the opposing forces. She {{spent most of her}} time reading and worrying about her children; her daughter, Alice, remained in occupied Greece and was unable to communicate with her mother for four years {{at the height of the}} war. After the Allied victory, her son, Louis, was offered the post of Viceroy of India, but she was deeply opposed to his accepting, knowing that the position <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> and difficult. He accepted anyway.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, the Brighton Marine Palace Pier Company (owned by the Noble Organisation), {{admitted}} {{an offence}} of breaching public safety under the Health and Safety at Work Act {{and had to}} pay fines and costs of £37,000 after a fairground ride was operated with part of its track missing. A representative from the Health and Safety Executive said that inadequate procedures were {{to blame for the}} fact that nothing had been done to alert staff or passengers that the ride <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> to use. The pier management came into criticism from Brighton and Hove City Council, who thought they were relying too much on fairground rides, some of which were being built too high.|$|E
5|$|Precisely because Prince Yelü Bei {{exemplified}} both Chinese and Khitan values, Empress Shulü Ping {{objected to}} Bei assuming {{the role of}} Emperor. The Empress believed that Bei's openness to Chinese culture detracted from his leadership ability as a Khitan, and she instead favored Emperor Taizu's more traditionalist second son, Yelü Deguang. Deguang enjoyed not only {{the support of his}} mother, but also of the Khitan nobility. Realizing that he could not assume the throne, and that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> to try, Bei campaigned in favor of allowing his younger brother to assume the throne, {{and by the end of}} 927, formally stated to his mother that Deguang's qualifications were superior to his own, functionally ending his ability to challenge Deguang's ascension to the throne.|$|E
5|$|He {{played a}} crucial role at the {{beginning}} of internal autonomy (1956–1958), although the relatively conservative Boganda remained sympathetic to French interests and still did not advocate immediate independence. For Boganda, the 1956 election, in which he took 89% of the vote against another Oubanguian, was an uncontested speaker's platform with which the colonial administration had come to terms; the French had realised that opposing him <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> and sought to accommodate him. That year he agreed to European representation on election lists in exchange for the financial support of French business leaders, and on 18 November, was elected as the first mayor of Bangui. On 31 March 1957, MESAN won all seats in the Territorial Assembly election; on 18 June, Boganda was elected president of the Grand Council of French Equatorial Africa (a forum he used to broadcast his views on African unity) and in May was appointed vice-president of the Oubangui-Chari Government Council (the French governor was still its president).|$|E

5|$|To {{catch the}} public's attention, this train {{was not simply}} rolled out of the factory; it made a dash {{from one end of}} the CB, in Denver, to the other, in Chicago on May 26, 1934. The {{railroad}} spared no expense in planning the operations. All other trains along the Zephyrs route were diverted to sidings and the turnouts were spiked into the proper alignment for the Zephyrs run. Track and maintenance of way workers checked every spike and bolt along the train's route to ensure that there would not be any problems, and temporary speed signs were installed along the route to warn the Zephyrs crew of curves that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> at high speeds. On the day of the dash, every road grade crossing was manned by a flagman to stop automobile traffic ahead of the train and to ensure that the crossing was clear. Stations along the route were protected by local police officers and members of the American Legion and the Boy Scouts of America.|$|E
5|$|The {{document}} {{states the}} need to defeat the royalist forces and therefore proposes many possible actions similar to those employed by Jacobins during the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution. It rejected the use of political moderation, considering that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> during revolutionary times. It compared the South American revolution, still in its early stages, with the French and North American ones, and even the revolution in Spain itself, pointing out that none of those relied solely in conspiracies or secret meetings. The document proposes to favor patriots, and fill the state offices with them. Peninsulars, on the other hand, should be carefully monitored, and punished at the slightest proof of action against the Junta, and executed if they were rich or influential. For this end, the Junta would need to create an espionage network. This policy towards peninsulars is coherent with the actions taken against the Liniers counter-revolution, and {{similar to the one}} employed by Simón Bolívar in the North shortly after. Moreno thought that José Gervasio Artigas would be an invaluable ally, and that Buenos Aires should use any resource at its disposal to have him join the fight against absolutism. He noted the internal conflicts in Chile and Paraguay, and urged support of local patriots against local royalists.|$|E

25|$|The {{rectangular}} {{central area}} of the cricket field – the space used for pitches – {{is known as the}} square.

25|$|The {{large-scale}} {{retreat of}} hundreds of thousands of military personnel and civilians <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>dangerous.</b> However, it was poorly planned, many senior officers were not kept informed, and some units were left behind or retreated incoherently. This was exacerbated by a three-day delay when the convoy encountered a broken bridge and had to rebuild it. The communist forces caught up, surrounded the convoy, and attacked it.|$|E

25|$|Worried by the {{persecution}} of Christians in the Soviet Union, Pius XI mandated Berlin nuncio Eugenio Pacelli to work secretly on diplomatic arrangements between the Vatican and the Soviet Union. Pacelli negotiated food shipments for Russia and met with Soviet representatives, including Foreign Minister Georgi Chicherin, who rejected any kind of religious education and the ordination of priests and bishops, but offered agreements without the points vital to the Vatican. Despite Vatican pessimism {{and a lack of}} visible progress, Pacelli continued the secret negotiations, until Pius XI ordered them discontinued in 1927, because they generated no results and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> to the Church, if made public.|$|E
25|$|The {{half-life}} of the radioisotopes {{produced by}} fusion {{tends to be}} less than those from fission, so that the inventory decreases more rapidly. Unlike fission reactors, whose waste remains radioactive for thousands of years, most of the radioactive material in a fusion reactor would be the reactor core itself, which <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> for about 50 years, and low-level waste for another 100. Although this waste will be considerably more radioactive during those 50 years than fission waste, the very short half-life makes the process very attractive, as the waste management is fairly straightforward. By 500 years the material would have the same radiotoxicity as coal ash.|$|E
