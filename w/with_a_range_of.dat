5|$|The Ohio {{class was}} {{designed}} in the 1970s to carry the concurrently-designed Trident submarine-launched ballistic missile. Both variants of the Tridents—the UGM-96 Trident I and the UGM-133 Trident II—are propelled by three-stage solid propellant rockets and are equipped with 8–14 nuclear warheads. The 73,000lb (33,100kg) UGM-96, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 4,000mi (6,400km), served from October 1979, starting with the Benjamin Franklin-class USS Francis Scott Key, until 2006. The 130,000lb (59,000kg) UGM-133, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> 6,000mi (9,700km), is in service , having been introduced in 1990 with USS Tennessee. The primary self-defense weapon of the class is the Mk 48 ADCAP torpedo. Ohio-class submarines that carry ballistic missiles receive orders from the United States Strategic Command based in Nebraska.|$|E

5|$|Ants form {{symbiotic}} associations <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. They {{also are}} preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend {{part of their}} lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian mimicry, where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines.|$|E
5|$|Archaea {{can also}} be commensals, benefiting from an {{association}} without helping or harming the other organism. For example, the methanogen Methanobrevibacter smithii {{is by far the}} most common archaean in the human flora, making up about one in ten of all the prokaryotes in the human gut. In termites and in humans, these methanogens may in fact be mutualists, interacting with other microbes in the gut to aid digestion. Archaean communities also associate <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> other organisms, such as on the surface of corals, and in the region of soil that surrounds plant roots (the rhizosphere).|$|E
5|$|Built <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> shops to both sides, {{the modernist}} {{design of the}} {{entrance}} vestibule {{takes the form of}} a double-height box clad in white Portland stone with a three-part glazed screen on the front façade divided by columns of which the capitals are three-dimensional versions of the Underground roundel. The central panel of the screen contains a large version of the roundel. The ticket hall beyond is octagonal with a central roof light of the same shape. The ticket hall originally had a pair of wooden ticket booths (passimeters) from which tickets were issued and collected, but these were removed when modern ticketing systems made them redundant.|$|E

5|$|In 1946 Churchill-Redman Ltd {{bought the}} Longfield foundry in Halifax to provide extra {{production}} capacity and leased {{a part of}} the Vickers Armstrong Admiralty works in Scotswood, Newcastle. It was intended that the Newcastle site concern itself <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> lathes intended for the motor industry, Austin and Vauxhall in particular; the Halifax operation would focus on manufacture of Fay lathes which were still being licensed from the US.|$|E
5|$|In fish {{such as the}} herring which live in {{shallower}} water, {{the mirrors}} must reflect a mixture of wavelengths, and the fish accordingly has crystal stacks <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> different spacings. A further complication for fish with bodies that are rounded in cross-section is that the mirrors would be ineffective if laid flat on the skin, as they would fail to reflect horizontally. The overall mirror effect is achieved with many small reflectors, all oriented vertically. Silvering is found in other marine animals as well as fish. The cephalopods, including squid, octopus and cuttlefish, have multi-layer mirrors made of protein rather than guanine.|$|E

5|$|Like other nuthatches, {{this is a}} noisy species <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> vocalizations. The male's mating song is a rapid nasal qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui.

A more distinctive sound is a shrill kri repeated rapidly with mounting anxiety or excitement kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri; the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin subspecies have a higher, faster yididitititit call, and Pacific birds a more nasal beeerf.|$|E

5|$|Mammals signal by {{a variety}} of means. Many give visual anti-predator signals, as when deer and gazelle stot, {{honestly}} indicating their fit condition and their ability to escape, or when white-tailed deer and other prey mammals flag with conspicuous tail markings when alarmed, informing the predator that it has been detected. Many mammals make use of scent-marking, sometimes possibly to help defend territory, but probably <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> functions both within and between species. Microbats and toothed whales including oceanic dolphins vocalize both socially and in echolocation.|$|E

5|$|The German Luftwaffe had Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor {{aircraft}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>range</b> <b>of</b> nearly 2,000 {{nautical miles}} (3700 km - 2300 miles). After the Fall of France, these aircraft could operate from western France against British merchant {{ships in the}} Atlantic.

The Royal Navy had no aircraft carriers available to provide close air cover for the convoys. The Fw 200s could shadow convoys, directing U-boat attacks on them, or drop bombs on convoy ships, without opposition and to deadly effect.|$|E
