40|$|We {{are experimenting}} with {{multiple}} mobile robots under visual control. The current goal of our work is to construct an architecture for robots engaged in cooperative and competitive behaviour. Multiple robots have recently {{been the focus of}} much attention; however, the little work that has been done with implemented systems has involved simple tasks and behaviours. We have initiated the Dynamo (Dynamics and Mobile Robots) Project to provide a link between theory and practice. One part of this project is the Dynamite testbed which consists of a fleet of radio controlled vehicles that receive commands from a remote computer. Robot position and orientation is determined using off-board visual sensing. <b>We</b> have <b>chosen</b> <b>soccer</b> <b>playing</b> as a domain for our experiments since it requires real-time interaction with a dynamic environment. It involves inter-robot cooperation as well as competition between teams. We outline two complementary approaches taken in our laboratory to robot control. The first, Constraint Nets, is a model for robotic systems and behaviours, which provides a theoretical foundation for systems design and analysis. Th...|$|R

Other athletic programs include basketball, indoor track, wrestling, baseball, softball, volleyball, track and field, tennis, a co-op ice hockey team with Bolton High School, Rockville High School, and Coventry High School, and formerly a co-op football team with RHAM High School. Because Lebanon {{does not have}} a youth football league of its own, it has been several years since a Lyman student played with the RHAM football team. Most students from Lebanon <b>choose</b> to <b>play</b> <b>soccer</b> over football because the town has a very strong youth soccer system.

Rather than go home during the off-season, he <b>chose</b> to <b>play</b> indoor <b>soccer</b> in the MISL for the Detroit Lightning. He played two more years in Dallas before the team was merged with the Tampa Bay Rowdies after the 1981 season. After one season with the Rowdies he joined the Tulsa Roughnecks and was a member of their Soccer Bowl winning side in 1983. From there he moved back to MISL, playing indoors for the Tacoma Stars. He finished out his career in the USL, first with the Dallas Americans in 1984, then with the Tulsa Tornados in 1985. It was in the indoor game that he had his greatest success while in the U.S.|$|R

50|$|The {{automorphism}} {{group of}} Z2 × Z2 × Z2 = Dih2 × Z2 has order 168, {{as can be}} found as follows. All 7 non-identity elements play the same role, so <b>we</b> can <b>choose</b> which <b>plays</b> the role of (1,0,0). Any of the remaining 6 can be <b>chosen</b> to <b>play</b> the role of (0,1,0). This determines which corresponds to (1,1,0). For (0,0,1) <b>we</b> can <b>choose</b> from 4, which determines the rest. Thus we have 7 × 6 × 4 = 168 automorphisms. They correspond {{to those of the}} Fano plane, of which the 7 points correspond to the 7 non-identity elements. The lines connecting three points correspond to the group operation: a, b, and c on one line means a + b = c, a + c = b, and b + c = a. See also general linear group over finite fields.|$|R

50|$|Following an {{unsuccessful}} trial with Manchester United in 1980, Wegerle <b>chose</b> to <b>play</b> college <b>soccer</b> in the United States. He spent two {{season with the}} University of South Florida in 1982 and 1983 and holds the school's single season scoring record with 21 goals. The Tampa Bay Rowdies of the North American Soccer League drafted Wegerle {{in the first round}} of the 1984 NASL college draft. He would play 21 games and score 9 goals, adding 17 assists, during the last year of the NASL's existence in 1984, being named league's Rookie of the Year. More significantly, Rodney Marsh coached him at Tampa Bay. This association would be integral to Wegerle's future move to England. When the league folded, Wegerle moved indoors with the Tacoma Stars of the Major Indoor Soccer League for two seasons. At the University of South Florida, Wegerle came under the professional instruction of ex-Chelsea striker and UEFA Cup Winners' Cup winner Derek Smethurst, who grounded him and got him ready for his professional career.|$|R

40|$|In {{the paper}} we first examine students´ {{ability to use}} tacit knowledge. We {{conducted}} the experiment to test whether the {{students are able to}} transfer and use tacit knowledge they obtained in the basic course of Strategic management. As tacit knowledge is difficult to transfer to another person we used course design with several experiential techniques to increase the students´ abilities in the field of Strategic management. For the evaluation experiment <b>we</b> <b>chose</b> to <b>play</b> a board game “Power Grid”, where we tested whether the students were able to use knowledge they had been taught in the basic course. As the result we found out low students´ ability to use tacit knowledge even despite {{the fact that in the}} basic course where they obtained the knowledge we used experiential techniques which force students to acquire a skill and therefore, according to Polanyi (in Schmidt, Hunter, 1993), they also acquire corresponding understanding that defies articulation, therefore tacit knowledge. According to the result of the experiment we propose the business game with the artificial intelligence as a teaching tool which can be further discussed as a tool for teaching specific tacit knowledge in the paper...|$|R
5000|$|The initial {{screenplay}} {{was written}} by Dante Harper, but an extensive rewrite was performed by screenwriter John Logan. Logan had previously worked with Scott on Gladiator. For Logan, the main concept was to adopt a dual plot line for the film which would combine the horror elements of Alien with the philosophical elements of Prometheus. He said, [...] "With Alien: Covenant, I just really wanted to write something that had {{the feel of the}} original Alien, because seeing that movie {{was one of the great}} events of my youth. It was so overpowering in terms of what it communicated to me and its implications, that when I started talking to Ridley about what became Alien: Covenant, I said, 'You know, that was a hell of a scary movie.' I wanted to write a horror movie because the Grand Guignol elements of Alien are so profound. We tried to recapture that with Alien: Covenant, while also trying to pay homage to the deeper implications of Prometheus. In terms of tone, pace, and how <b>we</b> <b>chose</b> to <b>play</b> this particular symphony, we wanted to create a really frightening movie." ...|$|R
