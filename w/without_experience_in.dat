500|$|The {{ambulance}} carrying McKinley {{reached the}} Exposition hospital at 4:25p.m. [...] Although it usually dealt {{only with the}} minor medical issues of fairgoers, the hospital did have an operating theatre. [...] At {{the time of the}} shooting, no fully qualified doctor was at the hospital, only nurses and interns. [...] The best surgeon in the city, and the Exposition's medical director, Dr. Roswell Park, was in Niagara Falls, performing a delicate neck operation. [...] When interrupted during the procedure on September 6 to be told he was needed in Buffalo, he responded that he could not leave, even for the President of the United States. [...] He was then told who had been shot. [...] Park, two weeks later, would save the life of a woman who suffered injuries almost identical to McKinley's. [...] The first physician to arrive at the hospital was Dr. Herman Mynter, whom the President had met briefly the previous day; the wounded McKinley (who had a good memory for faces) joked that when he had met Mynter, he had not expected to need his professional services. [...] As McKinley lay on the operating table, he stated of Czolgosz, [...] "He didn't know, poor fellow, what he was doing. [...] He couldn't have known." [...] With Park unavailable and with the fading afternoon light the major source of illumination in the operating room, when another surgeon, Dr. Matthew D. Mann arrived, {{the decision was made to}} operate at once to try to remove the remaining bullet. [...] Mynter had given McKinley an injection of morphine and strychnine to ease his pain; Mann (a noted gynecologist <b>without</b> <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> abdominal wounds) administered ether to sedate McKinley as the wounded man murmured the Lord's Prayer.|$|E

2500|$|Ideally, {{people who}} have had a stroke are {{admitted}} to a [...] "stroke unit", a ward or dedicated area in a hospital staffed by nurses and therapists with experience in stroke treatment.

2500|$|Street {{parking in}} urban neighborhoods is mostly {{controlled}} by the franeleros a.k.a. [...] "viene vienes" [...] (lit. [...] "come on, come on"), who ask drivers for a fee to park, in theory to guard the car, but with the implicit threat that the franelero will damage the car if the fee is not paid. Double parking is common (with franeleros moving the cars as required), impeding on the available lanes for traffic to pass. In order to mitigate that and other problems and to raise revenue, 721 parking meters (as of October 2013), have been installed in the west-central neighborhoods Lomas de Chapultepec, Condesa, Roma, Polanco and Anzures, in operation from 8 AM to 8 PM on weekdays and charging a rate of 2 pesos per 15 minutes, with offenders' cars booted, costing about 500 pesos to remove. 30 percent of the monthly 16 million-peso (as of October 2013) income from the parking-meter system (named [...] "ecoParq") is earmarked for neighborhood improvements. The granting of the license for all zones exclusively to a new company <b>without</b> <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> operating parking meters, Operadora de Estacionamientos Bicentenario, has generated controversy.|$|E

"Dear Sir,--I can {{scarcely}} feel {{surprise that the}} incident you mention, private as it was, should have filtered through our omnivorous journals to the mere populace; for the position I have since attained makes me, I conceive, a public character, and this was certainly the most extraordinary incident in a not uneventful and perhaps not an unimportant career. I am by no means <b>without</b> <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> scenes of civil tumult. I have faced many a political crisis in the old Primrose League days at Herne Bay, and, before I broke with the wilder set, have spent many {{a night at the}} Christian Social Union.

50|$|The {{selection}} of Bryce was somewhat unusual, {{in that he}} was a federal MP <b>without</b> <b>experience</b> <b>in</b> the provincial house.
