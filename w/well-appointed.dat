5|$|The halcyon {{days of the}} 1890s {{were the}} company's heyday, under {{president}} Richard Curzon Hoffman (the grandfather of noted author Walter Lord), when the prosperous line's gleaming steamships were heavily patronized by passengers enjoying the <b>well-appointed</b> staterooms and Chesapeake Bay culinary delights while dining {{to the accompaniment of}} live music. The nightly menu on board included oyster fritters, diamondback terrapin, duck, and turkey.|$|E
5|$|When {{she came}} {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy, Agincourt was {{considered}} a particularly comfortable ship and very <b>well-appointed</b> internally. A knowledge of Portuguese was necessary to work many of the fittings—including those in the heads—as the original instruction plates had not all been replaced when she was taken over by the British. In 1917, her crew numbered 1,268 officers and men.|$|E
5|$|The LS 400 {{was praised}} for its quietness, <b>well-appointed</b> and {{ergonomic}} interior, engine performance, build quality, aerodynamics, fuel economy and value. However, it was criticized by some automobile columnists for derivative styling and a suspension regarded as too compromising of handling for ride comfort. In some markets it was priced against mid-size, six-cylinder Mercedes-Benz and BMW models. It was rated by Car and Driver magazine as {{better than the}} higher-priced Mercedes-Benz 420 SEL and BMW 735i in terms of ride, handling and performance. The LS 400 also won motoring awards from automotive publications including Automobile Magazine and Wheels Magazine. Lexus quickly established customer loyalty and its debut was generally regarded {{as a shock to}} existing luxury marques. BMW's and Mercedes-Benz's U.S. sales figures dropped 29 percent and 19 percent, respectively, with BMW executives accusing Lexus of dumping in that market, while 35 percent of Lexus buyers traded in a Lincoln or Cadillac.|$|E
5|$|When {{it first}} opened, the ground had few {{facilities}} for either player or spectator. Uncovered terracing surrounded the pitch, and a hut acted as the players' changing room. A small but <b>well-appointed</b> covered wooden stand {{was built on}} the Coventry Road side, and over the years the terracing was enlarged to raise the capacity to around 30,000. In 1895, the football club bought the lease to the ground, which had 11 years remaining, for a sum of £275. Two years later, they paid £90 to their near neighbours, Aston Villa Football Club, for an old grandstand from Villa's former Wellington Road ground in Perry Barr. The club transported it piece by piece, and re-erected it as a terrace cover behind the goal at the Muntz Street end. No other major improvements were made, nor did the club ever move their administrative offices to the site, instead maintaining premises in Corporation Street, in Birmingham city centre.|$|E
25|$|Nothing has {{remained}} of the structures of Ayrivank. According to Armenian historians of the 4th, 8th and 10th centuries the monastery comprised, apart from religious buildings, <b>well-appointed</b> residential and service installations. Ayrivank suffered greatly in 923 from Nasr, a vice-regent of an Arabian caliph in Armenia, who plundered its valuable property, including unique manuscripts, and burned down the magnificent structures of the monastery. Earthquakes also did it no small damage.|$|E
25|$|The PSO wards {{are grouped}} into six {{clusters}} with nearby residences to form student communities (a seventh cluster {{is on the}} Tygerberg campus). For each of these clusters, a hub facility is being built, of which two have already been completed, namely amaMaties and Wimbledon. In this way, day students can enjoy the same benefits as residence students, such as mentor support, meals and a <b>well-appointed</b> place to go to between classes.|$|E
25|$|The entire play {{takes place}} in one room, “the living room of a large and <b>well-appointed</b> {{suburban}} house”. In that room is a bar, which is well stocked with bottles of liquor. Time changes from Friday night to Saturday evening, then later the same Saturday, and eventually to early Sunday morning, but the setting remains the same. This one room {{is the focal point}} of the house, where all the characters can meet to argue about the living arrangements in the other rooms of the house.|$|E
25|$|The {{poet and}} {{journalist}} Louis Latourette, upon visiting the artist's previously <b>well-appointed</b> studio after his transformation, discovered {{the place in}} upheaval, the Renaissance reproductions discarded from the walls, the plush drapes in disarray. Modigliani was already an alcoholic and a drug addict by this time, and his studio reflected this. Modigliani's behaviour at this time sheds some light upon his developing style as an artist, in that the studio had become almost a sacrificial effigy for all that he resented about the academic art that had marked {{his life and his}} training up to that point.|$|E
25|$|The King's Houses {{were once}} very <b>well-appointed.</b> The ruins that are visible today are {{the remains of}} a Romanesque chamber dating from around 1180. The stone chamber was {{accessed}} through a large, buttressed central doorway and had a timber upper floor which allowed views over the deer park from ornately carved windows. However, the chamber was {{only a small part of}} a large, multiphased complex of buildings which is known to have existed at Clipstone from documents, geophysical survey and archaeological excavation. These included a gatehouse, tower, individual hall and chambers for the King and Queen, several chapels, kitchens, stables for 200 horses, and lodgings for many royal retainers. There was also a Great Pond which provided 100 pike and 1600 roach during Edward II's visit in December 1315.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} take better {{advantage}} of passenger traffic, Boeing decided that it needed a larger aircraft that was more suitable for passenger carrying, and in early 1928 designed a trimotor aircraft capable of carrying 12 passengers, the Model 80. Unlike the Fokker F.VII and Ford Trimotors operated by other airlines, the Model 80 was a biplane, chosen to give good takeoff and landing performance when operating from difficult airfields on its routes, {{many of which were}} at relatively high altitude. The fuselage was of fabric covered steel and aluminium tube construction, and carried its 12 passengers in three-abreast seating in a <b>well-appointed</b> cabin. The flight crew of two sat in an enclosed flight deck forward of the passenger cabin. The wings were of fabric covered steel and duralumin construction, with detachable wingtips to aid storage in hangars.|$|E
25|$|Configured with 85 seats, {{the cabin}} was spacious and <b>well-appointed</b> with {{comfortable}} seats widely spaced, giving plenty of legroom, {{but due to}} the low cabin floor and wide diameter, there was much unusable space which limited baggage and cargo volume. The inefficient use of cabin volume contributed greatly to the low payload/TOW ratio which was much {{lower than that of}} the contemporary Ilyushin Il-18, but which was still higher than the Tupolev Tu-104. A later production version, the An-10A, addressed some of the efficiency concerns by increasing the number of seats from 85 to 89 and 100 (in the two versions of the An-10A), then to 117–118 and finally 132 through reducing seat pitch and changing the cabin layout. Powered by Ivchenko AI-20K engines the An-10A demonstrated superior performance and an increased maximum payload of 14.5 Tonnes (31,970lb). The auxiliary endplate fins eventually gave way to improved splayed ventral fins under the rear fuselage. The directional stability was now acceptable and the new ventral fins also improved longitudinal stability at high g and on landing approach, as well as delaying the onset of Mach buffet to M0.702. Due to being sited in an area of flow separation, the new ventral fins also caused unpleasant vibrations. Following results of flight tests and at least two fatal crashes, an effective tailplane deicing system was retrofitted to all remaining aircraft.|$|E
500|$|Greater Manchester's {{housing stock}} {{comprises}} {{a variety of}} types. Manchester city centre is noted for its high-rise apartments, while Salford {{has some of the}} tallest and most densely populated tower block estates in Europe. Saddleworth has stone-built properties, including farmhouses and converted weavers' cottages. Throughout Greater Manchester, rows of terraced houses are common, most of them built during the Victorian and Edwardian periods. House prices and labour markets differ in Greater Manchester between north and south, such that in the 2000s, the Housing Market Renewal Initiative identified Manchester, Salford, Rochdale and Oldham as areas with terraced housing unsuited to modern needs. In contrast, towns and villages in southern Greater Manchester, from Bramhall through Woodford to Altrincham constitute an arc of wealthy commuter towns. Altrincham in particular, with its neighbours Bowdon and Hale, forms a [...] "stockbroker belt, with <b>well-appointed</b> dwellings in an area of sylvan opulence".|$|E
500|$|Even {{after the}} King's Company got their new <b>well-appointed</b> playhouse in Drury Lane in 1674, {{they could not}} take full {{advantage}} of it, as they lacked the capital to mount competitive spectaculars. Instead, they attempted to simultaneously capitalise on and snipe at the Duke's most successful mid-1670s offerings by mounting several burlesques or parodies of them, written by Thomas Duffett. The records for the mid-1670s are particularly incomplete, and neither exact dates nor the public reaction to Duffett's pieces are known, but even the printed versions, pale shadows of Duffett's travesty spectacles, have proved highly amusing to modern critics. The first of them, The Empress of Morocco, caricatured simultaneously Settle's Empress of Morocco and the sumptuous new Dorset Garden production of Davenant's Macbeth adaptation, with Duffett's three witches flying in over the pit on brooms at the high point of the action, followed by the descent of Heccate over the Stage [...] "in a glorious chariot, adorned with pictures of hell and devils, and made of a large wicker basket". The Mock Tempest improves on the shower of fire over the audience in the Dorset Garden pseudo-Shakespearean tempest scene with a rain of [...] "fire, apples, nuts".|$|E
500|$|Writing for Slate, Sam Adams {{stated that}} Hawley's {{intention}} to deconstruct the superhero genre [...] "doesn’t {{seem like an}} accurate description of what the series is doing, or even trying to do", calling the series [...] "a <b>well-appointed</b> show: It’s handsomely shot, and smartly acted, and ingeniously constructed enough to suggest there’s something mind-blowing lurking at its center ... it starts {{to feel like a}} show with a Rubik’s cube where its heart should be." [...] David Sims at The Atlantic called Legion [...] "the latest, and most indulgent, entrant" [...] in a trend of [...] "shows that rely far less on plot than on mood, that are crammed with stunning visuals and frustrating, circular dialogue." [...] Sims praised the series' style and Stevens' performance, but felt that [...] "it tries so hard to dazzle that it forgets to tell a meaningful story." [...] The Washington Posts Hank Stuever also questioned the need for another series where [...] "viewers find themselves trapped {{in the center of a}} tortured mind". Stuever had mixed feelings for the show overall, calling it [...] "beautifully made" [...] but asking, [...] "Must it always be the viewer’s job to pick up the pieces?" ...|$|E
500|$|Historically, Altrincham was {{a market}} {{town and the}} two main areas of {{employment}} were agriculture and market trade. Although the town went into decline in the 15th century, it recovered and the annual fairs lasted until the mid-19th century and the market still continues. During the Industrial Revolution, Altrincham grew as an industrial town, particularly the Broadheath area, which was developed into an industrial estate. In 1801 there were four cotton mills in Altrincham, part of its textile industry, although they had closed by the 1851 census. The decline of the textile industry in Altrincham mirrored {{the decline of the}} industry in the Trafford area {{as a result of a}} lack of investment and the development of more established industrial areas such as Manchester, Ashton-under-Lyne, and Oldham. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, heavier industries moved into Broadheath, providing local employment. The area steadily declined during the second half of the 20th century, with employment at Broadheath falling from 8,000 to 5,000 between 1960 and 1970. Despite the presence of retailers such as Tesco, Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer in the town, a new Asda superstore in Broadheath, and redevelopment schemes costing over £100million, Altrincham's 15.5per cent level of employment in retail is below the national average of 16.9per cent. Altrincham, with its neighbours Bowdon and Hale, is said to constitute a [...] "stockbroker belt", with <b>well-appointed</b> dwellings in an area of [...] opulence.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fourth group}} {{includes}} the more modest (but still <b>well-appointed)</b> smaller scale apartment buildings {{constructed in the}} 1910s and 1920s to cater to more upper-middle-class tenants such as automobile company workers and professionals. This group includes [...] the Manchester Apartments (1915), Jefferson Hall (1916), the Ponchartrain Apartments (1920), the Chateau Frontenac Apartments (1925), the Somerset Apartments (1922), and the Hibbard Apartment Building (1924). These structures are distinguished by their smaller scale and less <b>well-appointed</b> but still high quality rooms.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>well-appointed</b> {{house at}} Guildford was named [...] "Bower". A single artwork by Meares remains, {{a drawing of}} a mill at York, though records of others, since destroyed, include one of his {{residence}} at York.|$|E
2500|$|Piedmont Club – Not {{a country}} club, the [...] "Società Umberto Principe di Piemonte, Inc." [...] was {{organized}} July 15, 1916 and [...] "a <b>well-appointed</b> and commodious clubhouse" [...] just off Noroton Avenue was erected in 1923, {{according to a}} town history published in 1935.|$|E
2500|$|SS Pacific was a wooden-hulled, sidewheel steamer {{built in}} 1849 for transatlantic service with the American Collins Line. Designed to outclass their chief rivals from the British-owned Cunard Line, Pacific {{and her three}} sister ships (Atlantic, [...] and [...] ) were the largest, fastest and most <b>well-appointed</b> transatlantic steamers of their day.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{as social}} rules {{loosened}} in the 1960s and 1970s, the Clark Home continued to operate under strict rules for its residents. [...] In 1963, the Los Angeles Times reported: [...] "Clark girls today live {{much as the}} first Clark residents did – in private rooms, taking their meals in a <b>well-appointed</b> dining room (slacks and curlers are not permitted at dinner) and twice weekly they dine by candlelight." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 16 May 1873, {{a wooden}} {{promenade}} pier was opened {{to allow the}} pleasure steamers to berth at all tides. On 23 June 1894, it {{was reported in the}} Ilfracombe Chronicle that over 2,500 people arrived in no less than seven boats, it describes them as 'commodious and <b>well-appointed</b> vessels with an excellent reputation for speed and comfort.' [...] As well as holidaymakers, the boats carried workers, live and dead stock and other merchandise to and from the town.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{facilities}} include {{elementary schools}} Miller-Driscoll School (pre-K–2) and Cider Mill School (3–5). [...] There is one middle school named Middlebrook School (6–8) and one high school named Wilton High School, which features accelerated classes for gifted students, music {{and visual arts}} courses, and a <b>well-appointed</b> resource center. [...] An innovative language laboratory encourages foreign language studies, including French, German, Spanish, and Latin; {{they are one of}} the only towns in the country that still offers Classical Greek.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interior}} was very <b>well-appointed</b> for this size of car, reflecting a determination {{not to let}} the car compete on price in the volume end of the small car market (already by now contested by the Citroën Ami). [...] The Panhard 24 {{was one of the first}} cars to offer optional seat belts. [...] The front seat backs were adjustable for rake and the seats were also – unusually at this time – adjustable for height. [...] The passenger's sun visor included a vanity mirror with its own light and the steering wheel was adjustable. [...] The car also boasted an unusually elaborate heater.|$|E
2500|$|She {{was soon}} {{contracted}} by Nash Motors and styled the elegant interiors {{of most of}} the cars from 1948 to 1956. Even the economical Nash Rambler models were prominently promoted as [...] "irresistible glamour" [...] on wheels. The innovative 100-inch wheelbase Rambler was conceived initially as a <b>well-appointed</b> convertible with its interior designed with the aid of Rother as a consultant. Nash used a strategy to give the new Rambler a positive public image by avoiding it being seen by the public as a [...] "cheap little car." [...] It was [...] "well-equipped and stylish" [...] with no [...] "stripped-down" [...] versions. The focus on design and quality features helped establish a new segment in the automobile market, as the Rambler is widely acknowledged to be the first successful modern American compact car.|$|E
2500|$|In 1914, Balch {{sold the}} hotel to Frank and Ethel Ingels. [...] The onset of the Great Depression, which was {{attended}} by {{the closure of the}} railroad and the failure of a major local apple orchard, marked the end of Dufur's and the hotel's heyday. The Ingels family operated the hotel until the 1940s. [...] When they sold the building, it was converted into apartments. [...] It was a rooming house {{for a number of years}} and later a private residence. [...] The building was eventually purchased by Howard and Patricia Green in 1988. [...] The Greens restored and modernized the building and reopened the hotel. [...] In 2006, Jeff and Samantha Irwin purchased the hotel from the Greens. [...] The Irwins continued the Greens' restoration work. Then in June 2015, Claire Sierra and Josiah [...] Dean took over operations. Today, the Balch Hotel is a small but <b>well-appointed</b> tourist hotel.|$|E
2500|$|Born at 11 Valley Road, an interwar {{council house}} in Grove Hill, Middlesbrough, Yorkshire, Brian Clough was the sixth of nine {{children}} of a local sweet shop worker, later sugar boiler and then manager. The eldest, Elizabeth, died in 1927 of septicaemia {{at the age of}} four. When talking of his childhood he said he [...] "adored it in all its aspects. If anyone should be grateful for their upbringing, for their mam and dad, I'm that person. I was the kid who came from a little part of paradise." [...] On his upbringing in Middlesbrough, Clough claimed that it was not the most <b>well-appointed</b> place in the world, [...] "But to me it was heaven". [...] "Everything I have done, everything I've achieved, everything that I can think of that has directed and affected my life – apart from the drink – stemmed from my childhood. Maybe it was the constant sight of Mam, with eight children to look after, working from morning until night, working harder than you or I have ever worked." ...|$|E
2500|$|The demonstrations raised {{questions}} for Harvard students {{about their own}} role in the nation's economic elite—the so-called [...] "1%". Even participants struggled {{with the question of}} how Harvard students could authentically express solidarity with the downtrodden of the world. Students deliberated over the effects of Harvard's comprehensive financial aid policies. Neal Gabler wrote in the New York Times that Harvard students were [...] "superachivers", even considering the effects of financial aid. They were [...] "likely to be wealthy, <b>well-appointed</b> young people groomed and professionalized at an early age precisely so they would impress admissions officers." [...] One Harvard graduate who had already joined Occupy Boston told the Boston Globe that attending Harvard did not ensure membership in the 1%, saying: [...] "I’m the first person in my family to go to college, and I worked hard to go to Harvard, but I feel that the way the country is now, the American dream isn’t possible.’" [...] Some students in a dormitory near the encampment responded directly, chanting [...] "We are the one percent" [...] and yelling insults.|$|E
2500|$|Not much is yet {{known about}} pre-Roman {{settlement}} in the immediate area. The fort was probably established around AD79 to guard the crossing of the River Wear by Dere Street, the main Roman road between York, Hadrian's Wall and Scotland, and also the fort's via principalis. Sitting atop a hill [...] above the Wear, Binchester was the largest Roman fort in County Durham. The land was cleared of trees and brush and a huge levelling fill laid down on the plateau before construction of the fort began. Archaeologists found four coins of Vespasian that seem to corroborate that initial building was related to Agricola's march northward into {{the territory of the}} Brigantes. Two phases of timber structures, most likely barrack blocks, were constructed atop the levelling deposit. Much later, perhaps centuries later, buildings inside the fort were levelled and reconstructed in stone. These included a commandant's house {{at the heart of the}} fort and a <b>well-appointed</b> baths building, both of which went through several phases of development (see below under the archaeological history).|$|E
60|$|When the {{two were}} {{established}} at a <b>well-appointed</b> table, with a promising waiter hovering in attendance, Chandler began to experience the real joy that his regular outing always brought to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "No lie that!" [...] said Mohi. [...] "Beshrew me, in no <b>well-appointed</b> mansion doth {{the pantry}} lie {{adjoining}} the sleeping chamber. A good thought: I'll fill up, and ponder on it." ...|$|E
