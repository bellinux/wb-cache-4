2500|$|According to Meyer, {{the book}} was {{inspired}} and influenced by Wuthering Heights by Emily Brontë, although she does not like the book. She said that characters of the book fascinate her and she enjoys reading certain parts, but does not enjoy the book as a whole because she finds it very depressing—an opinion expressed by Edward in Eclipse. When comparing Edward and Jacob to Heathcliff and Edgar Linton of Wuthering Heights, she said, [...] "You could look at Edward and Jacob from one perspective and say: Okay, this one is Heathcliff {{and this one is}} Edgar. And someone else might say: No, <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> Because of this reason and that reason, that one is Heathcliff and the other one is Edgar...I like that confusion, because that's how life is." [...] In August 2009, The Telegraph reported that HarperCollins' Wuthering Heights edition—which has a [...] "gothic" [...] cover similar to the Twilight covers—has sold more than 10,000 copies since May of that year, {{more than twice as many}} as the traditional Penguin Classics edition, and topped the newspaper's classic books chart for the first time due to Meyer referencing the novel.|$|E
60|$|ANNA--What's the rush? <b>Wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> [Forgetting the {{situation}} for a moment, she relapses into the familiar form and flashes one of her winning trade smiles at him.] Gee, I'm thirsty.|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked at}} her for a moment until his benumbed brain took in her words and all their meaning; then he said: [...] "All right, Jinnie, just <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> till I have another horn with these yer gents----" ...|$|E
60|$|Margaret <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> or two, {{and then}} {{addressed}} her aunt.|$|R
6000|$|I <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> [...] "No," [...] I answered, slowly. [...] "I {{have not}} been practising of late. I am looking about me. I travel for enjoyment." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Tom {{he stood}} there and <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> or two--that was for to work up an [...] "effect," [...] as he calls it--then he started in just as ca'm as ever, and says: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Doubt it,' replied Pringle. 'It's {{all very}} well for you. You bowl to hit the sticks. I don't. Now just watch these kids for a moment. Now! Look! No, he couldn't have got to that. <b>Wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> Now!' ...|$|E
60|$|Mercedes did not <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> bidding, but, {{rising from}} her knees, she hastened {{to do as}} the queen had suggested. Isabella and the marchioness were silent some little time, when left to themselves; then the former, as became her rank, opened the discourse.|$|E
6000|$|STEPHEN: (Abruptly) What went {{forth to}} the ends of the world to {{traverse}} not itself, God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself becomes that self. Wait a moment. <b>Wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco! ...|$|E
60|$|Benjy <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> few <b>seconds,</b> {{and then}} gave the handle another and {{slightly}} stronger turn.|$|R
60|$|Benham <b>waited</b> for <b>a</b> <b>second</b> or {{so before}} he {{broached}} his own idea.|$|R
60|$|Griffith, without <b>waiting</b> for <b>a</b> <b>second</b> bidding, {{hastened to}} Borroughcliffe with his intelligence.|$|R
6000|$|Calvin {{looked down}} at his panting, reeking horse, and {{carelessly}} replied: [...] "Oh no. I'm just takin' it out o' this watch-eyed bronco." [...] He exchanged a look with the sheriff. [...] "I thought I'd ketch ye 'fore ye left the agency. I'd like a word with you, sheriff; tumble out here for a minute. You'll <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> won't you, Major?" ...|$|E
60|$|So I did not <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> {{time for}} Maud to send me. I {{discovered}} that {{we stood in}} need of condensed milk and marmalade, and announced that I was going aboard. I {{could see that she}} wavered. She {{even went so far as}} to murmur that they were non-essentials and that my trip after them might be inexpedient. And as she had followed the trend of my silence, she now followed the trend of my speech, and she knew that I was going aboard, not because of condensed milk and marmalade, but because of her and of her anxiety, which she knew she had failed to hide.|$|E
60|$|But {{this year}} Shirley {{was to be}} with her, and that changed the aspect of the trial singularly--it changed it utterly. It was a trial no longer--it was almost an enjoyment. Miss Keeldar was better in her single self than a host of {{ordinary}} friends. Quite self-possessed, and always spirited and easy; conscious of her social importance, yet never presuming upon it--it {{would be enough to}} give one courage only to look at her. The only fear was lest the heiress should not be punctual to tryst. She often had a careless way of lingering behind time, and Caroline knew her uncle would not <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> for any one. At the moment of the church clock tolling two, the bells would clash out and the march begin. She must look after Shirley, then, in this matter, or her expected companion would fail her.|$|E

6000|$|The {{little woman}} <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> few <b>seconds</b> {{for him to}} continue, but, since he {{remained}} silent, she asked, with mild curiosity: ...|$|R
5000|$|Woah Woah Woah, Hold on <b>a</b> Minute, <b>Wait</b> Just <b>a</b> <b>Second,</b> There’s Way Too Much Butter on That ...|$|R
60|$|Luis de Bobadilla did not <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> bidding, but hurried {{from the}} presence, {{as fast as}} {{etiquette}} would allow, and the next minute {{he was in the}} saddle. At his appearance, Mercedes had shrunk into the recess of a window, where she now, luckily, commanded a view of the court. As her lover gained his seat, he caught a glimpse of her form; and though the spurs were already in his charger's flanks, the rein tightened, and the snorting steed was thrown suddenly on his haunches. So elastic are the feelings of youth, so deceptive and flattering the hopes of those who love, that the glances which were exchanged were those of mutual delight. Neither thought of all the desperate chances of the contemplated voyage; of the probability of its want of success; or of the many motives which might still induce the queen to withhold her consent. Mercedes awoke first from the short trance that succeeded, for, taking the alarm at Luis' indiscreet delay, she motioned him hurriedly to proceed. Again the rowels were buried in the flanks of the noble animal; fire flashed beneath his armed heels, and, at the next minute, Don Luis de Bobadilla had disappeared.|$|E
50|$|During the <b>wait,</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> Black Hawk helicopter, callsign Super 64 and piloted by CW3 Michael Durant, {{was shot}} down by an RPG-7 at around 16:40.|$|E
50|$|You don't believe it? Well, <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> Let's use {{the same}} kind of {{statistical}} analysis the Public Health Service is using to 'prove' that cigarettes cause cancer. We'll use only statistical facts taken from bona fide population surveys.|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} did not <b>wait</b> for <b>a</b> <b>second</b> invitation, but gently touched his lips to their soft young cheeks.|$|R
60|$|No {{answer came}} back, nor did any dog put in <b>an</b> appearance. Ralph <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> few <b>seconds</b> longer, {{and then made}} {{straight}} for the house.|$|R
60|$|Nevis did not <b>wait</b> for <b>a</b> <b>second</b> {{invitation}} and {{she turned}} to him when he had taken his place at her side.|$|R
5000|$|Episode 8. [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] (Released September 18) If {{you thought}} {{this story was}} all songs and dance, you're looking in the wrong place! Assist Beauty (and her family) with her Beast as she goes through her water-locked hometown, a frozen forest, an enchanted castle, a rich town, Beauty's dream world, and a wedding that was crashed by pirates... <b>Wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>second!</b> That's {{not part of the}} story! Ah, well; what can you do when Grimm's in town? ...|$|E
50|$|With a good rod {{and decent}} mono or flurocarbon line, the 'thump' of a bass should be easily felt on limp line. After the first 'thump', <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> {{to see if}} there is a second one as he sucks the worm in further. At this point, or if there is no second 'thump' after a second or so, draw up most of the slack and set the hook HARD AND FAST. This is {{important}} to set the hook. Then hold steady tension on the fish until landed.|$|E
5000|$|The sitcom {{was welcomed}} to {{generally}} mixed reviews from critics. Boston Herald said [...] "This is more soap than sitcom, an upscale Dynasty crossed with Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? {{with a dash}} of urban sass. It knocks you back with a bracing dose of its characters’ resentments and rages." [...] Opportunity LOL said [...] "I am curious why Tyler Perry wrote for most characters to be so ostentatiously wealthy as it brings the style a little too close to day-time soap operas. <b>Wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> did Tyler Perry convince me to watch a soap opera?".|$|E
60|$|He looked quite triumphantly at Mrs Tipps and her companions, and <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> few <b>seconds</b> as if {{to allow}} the idea to exert its full force on them.|$|R
60|$|They {{hurried down}} the damp steps to the <b>waiting</b> car. <b>A</b> <b>second</b> later the driver lifted the car up into the air, above the house-tops.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} will," [...] Sam said, promptly, after <b>waiting</b> <b>a</b> few <b>seconds</b> without hearing any reply from Teddy. [...] "Tell {{us what to}} do, an' I'll see to the whole thing." ...|$|R
5000|$|Tom Howard of NME {{praised the}} track, commenting [...] "Yeah… so… um… <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> go Everything Everything like the shy and polite young chaps they are. But then they {{break into a}} Dirty-Projectors-crossed with-Destiny’s-Child thing that makes you wish they'd go on a two-year hiatus and make comebacks all the bloody time. Suddenly they sound like saviours of music". [...] "Cough Cough" [...] was also met with {{positive}} reception from Doron Davidson-Vidavski of Londonist, who noted it as a [...] "manic and wonderful track which highlights all that is unique about the quartet: choppy song structures, hectic vocals and hooksome melodies." [...] The song reached #100 on Triple J Hottest 100 of 2012.|$|E
5000|$|Event 6 - Eliminator:Tracey led Melanie by {{thirteen}} points {{giving her}} a {{six and a half}} second headstart. Tracey got through the eliminator first without a blip and sailed into the quarter finals while Melanie who had trouble on the rope eventually completed the Eliminator second. Geoff led Brian by one point giving him a half a second head start. Geoff before the whistle forcing him to <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> allowing Brian to lead until they reached the hand bikes where it became even. When they reached the travelator, Geoff tripped while Brian almost made it up without harm but nearer the top he tripped but grabbed on the platform and rope swing through the paper and into the quarter finals while Geoff eventually made it up the travelator without hassle on the second go and rope swing through the paper.|$|E
5000|$|Redfoo {{was offered}} the {{opportunity}} to join the judging panel {{during his visit to}} Australia for the 2013 Australian Open, where he was supporting girlfriend and then-World number-one Victoria Azarenka. The producers later visited his recording studio in Hollywood and explained to him what The X Factor is about. In an interview with The West Australian, Redfoo said [...] "they basically explained the show because I didn't know if I wanted to just be a judge. And they said 'Wait a second, <b>wait</b> <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> no it's not just judging, that's just to pick your team. Then you're really a mentor, you're going to be mentoring a category.' Then they said 'You can be a winner too.'" [...] Minogue revealed to The Daily Telegraph that she was offered many other TV roles but chose to join The X Factor because she had always been a fan of the Australian version.|$|E
60|$|The Rover boys <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> few <b>seconds</b> {{and then}} {{knocked on the}} back door of the cottage. The farm hand, a fellow named Dan Murdock, stamped over to the door and threw it open.|$|R
60|$|Joy unspeakable to {{feel his}} fingers close over her wrist, like iron, even while the bush to which she had trusted was {{detaching}} itself, almost uprooted by her weight! If she had <b>waited</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> {{she would have been}} lost, but her confidence had been her safety. A moment or two more, and with closed eyes she was leaning against him; his arm was round her, and he guided her steps, till, breathless, she found herself on the broad well-trodden path, {{out of sight of the}} precipice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said I, {{in a low}} voice, for I {{was afraid}} lest my indignation should {{get the better of}} me, [...] "I tell you plain that, though your words are so smooth, I do not believe that which you tell me. Go to your cabin, sir, {{and let me tell you}} that if I see {{anything}} that may tend to confirm my suspicions of you, I will clap you in irons, without <b>waiting</b> <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> and as sure as you are a living man." ...|$|R
