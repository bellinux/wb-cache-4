25|$|By 1938, an {{estimated}} 20 woodpeckers {{remained in the}} wild, some six to eight of which were in the old-growth forest called the Singer Tract, owned by the Singer Sewing Company in Madison Parish in northeastern Louisiana, where logging rights were held by the Chicago Mill and Lumber Company. The company brushed aside pleas from four Southern governors and the National Audubon Society that the tract be publicly purchased and set aside as a reserve. By 1944, the last known ivory-billed woodpecker, a female, <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> <b>from</b> the cut-over tract.|$|E
25|$|Gein {{admitted}} to stealing from nine graves and led investigators to their locations. Because authorities were uncertain {{as to whether}} the slight Gein was capable of single-handedly digging up a grave during a single evening, they exhumed two of the graves and found them empty (one had a crowbar in place of the body), thus apparently corroborating Gein's confession. Allan Wilimovsky of the state crime laboratory participated in opening three test graves identified by Gein. The caskets were inside wooden boxes; the top boards ran crossways (not lengthwise). The tops of the boxes were about two feet (60 cm) below the surface in sandy soil. Gein had robbed the graves soon after the funerals while the graves were not completed. They were found as Gein described: One casket was empty, one Gein had failed to open when he lost his pry bar, and most of the body <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> <b>from</b> the third, but Gein had returned rings and some body parts.|$|E
25|$|Infuriated by Russo's actions (which {{conflicted}} with his intentions for Bash), Bischoff departed {{once more in}} July 2000. At the New Blood Rising pay-per-view on August 13, an injured Goldberg walked out of a triple threat elimination contest against Kevin Nash and Scott Steiner (violating the script of the match) and swore at Russo {{on his way back}} to the dressing room on-camera, leaving Steiner to wrestle and lose to Nash by himself. As a result of Goldberg's actions at New Blood Rising, the storyline was drastically changed to a rivalry between Steiner and Goldberg, culminating in a match at Fall Brawl, which Steiner won. Immediately afterward, Russo informed Goldberg that if he ever lost another match from that point, he would be released from his WCW contract. In truth however, this was an opportunity for Goldberg to heal from previous injuries. Russo <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> <b>from</b> the promotion entirely by late 2000, leaving Terry Taylor and Johnny Ace holding the reins. During this time, a short-lived crossover feud began involving stars of WCW and Battle Dome.|$|E

25|$|In Europe, moose are {{currently}} found {{in large numbers}} throughout Norway, Sweden, Finland, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, with more modest numbers in the southern Czech Republic, Belarus and northern Ukraine. They are also widespread through Russia on up through the borders with Finland south towards the border with Estonia, Belarus and Ukraine and stretching far away eastwards to the Yenisei River in Siberia. The European moose was native to most temperate areas with suitable habitat on the continent and even Scotland {{from the end of}} the last Ice Age, as Europe had a mix of temperate boreal and deciduous forest. Up through Classical times, the species was certainly thriving in both Gaul and Magna Germania, as it appears in military and hunting accounts of the age. However, as the Roman era faded into medieval times, the beast slowly disappeared: soon after the reign of Charlemagne, the moose disappeared from France, where its range extended from Normandy in the north to the Pyrenees in the south. Farther east, it survived in Alsace and the Netherlands until the 9th century as the marshlands in the latter were drained and the forests were cleared away for feudal lands in the former. It <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> <b>from</b> Switzerland by the year 1000, gone from the western Czech Republic by 1300, gone from Mecklenburg in Germany by c. 1600, and has been gone from Hungary and the Caucasus since the 18th and 19th century, respectively.|$|E
500|$|The {{defense of}} San Juan {{served as the}} base for the legend of [...] "La Rogativa". [...] According to the popular Puerto Rican legend, {{on the night of}} April 30, 1797, the townswomen, led by a bishop, formed a rogativa (prayer procession) and marched {{throughout}} the streets of the city singing hymns and carrying torches {{while at the same time}} praying for the deliverance of the city. Outside the walls, the invaders mistook the torch-lit movement for the arrival of Spanish reinforcements. When morning came, the enemy <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> <b>from</b> the island and the city was saved from a possible invasion. Four statues, sculptured by Lindsay Daen in the Plazuela de la Rogativa (Rogativa Plaza) in Old San Juan, pay tribute to the bishop and townswomen who participated in La Rogativa.|$|E
500|$|Daily was {{successful}} {{as a starting}} pitcher early in his major league career. [...] In 1883 and 1884, he won 20 or more games each season, while finishing in the top ten among league leaders in major pitching categories such as earned run average (as calculated retroactively, since E.R.A. was not an official statistic at the time), innings pitched, complete games, and strikeouts. [...] Daily established the pitching record for strikeouts in a season (later surpassed), tied a record by tossing two consecutive one-hitters, broke the record for one-hitters in a season, and threw a no-hitter. [...] After his initial three years of success, the final three years of his career were marked by quick decline in his seasonal numbers, and he <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> <b>from</b> organised baseball shortly thereafter. [...] Today he remains a mysterious figure, as there is little record of his activities after his career. [...] It is unclear where he lived and where he died.|$|E

500|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, it was {{uncertain}} whether the kakapo {{was still an}} extant species. At the end of 1974, scientists located several more male kakapo and made the first scientific observations of kakapo booming. These observations led Don Merton to speculate {{for the first time}} that the kakapo had a lek breeding system. From 1974 to 1976, 14 kakapo were discovered but all appeared to be males. This raised the possibility that the species would become extinct, because there might be no surviving females. One male bird was captured in the Milford area in 1975, christened [...] "Richard Henry", and transferred to Maud Island. All the birds the Wildlife Service discovered from 1951 to 1976 were in U-shaped glaciated valleys flanked by almost-vertical cliffs and surrounded by high mountains. Such extreme terrain had slowed colonisation by browsing mammals, leaving islands of virtually unmodified native vegetation. However, even here, stoats were present and by 1976 the kakapo <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> <b>from</b> the valley floors and only a few males survived high on the most inaccessible parts of the cliffs.|$|E

Officially I was in the band at that time, and they did that song without me". Clarke also mentioned that before the final show of the Use Your Illusion Tour, Rose came up to him and told him [...] "Hey, enjoy your last show".

2500|$|It was the An Lushan Rebellion and not {{the defeat}} at Talas that ended the Tang Chinese {{presence}} in Central Asia and forced them to withdraw from Xinjiang- the significance of Talas was overblown, because the Arabs did not proceed any further after the battle. Because the Arabs did not proceed to Xinjiang at all, the battle was of no importance strategically, it was An Lushan's rebellion which ended up forcing the Tang Chinese out of Central Asia. Despite the conversion of some Karluk Turks after the Battle of Talas, the majority of Karluks did not convert to Islam until the mid 10th century under Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan [...] when they established the Kara-Khanid Khanate.

2500|$|Late in the {{day they}} heard , the Big Giant, approaching. [...] His {{footsteps}} shook the canyon walls. Then they saw him come to the water's edge and stoop down to drink. He drank deeply four times, until most of the water <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> <b>from</b> the lake. Then he saw {{the reflection of the}} twins in the water, and stood and stared at them. [...] he shouted. The twins did not understand, but answered, [...] Then [...] paced back and forth and said, [...] "What are the two beautiful things that I see, and how shall I kill them?" [...] The twins shouted back, [...] "What beautiful Big Thing is walking about? [...] And how shall we kill it?" [...] , the Wind came to them and whispered in their ear that since Big Giant was their elder he should be given right of first strike, as they were destroying the child of the Sun. Then suddenly , the Wind, called [...] "Akóóh! Beware! Jump!" [...] and suddenly the twins found themselves standing {{on the end of a}} rainbow, just as , the Big Giant, hurled his great black knife at them. The rainbow raised up, and the knife passed just below their feet. [...] , the Wind, whispered [...] "Keep low now!" [...] and [...] hurled his great blue knife. [...] It passed over them. [...] The Wind said, [...] "Jump to the right!" [...] and the great yellow knife of [...] passed just to their left. [...] "This is his last weapon," [...] whispered the Wind. [...] "Jump to the left. Now!" [...] The twins leapt to the left, just as the white knife with many points passed to the right of them." [...] The twins were about to use one of their own weapons when a blinding flash of lightning came out of the sky and struck [...] the Giant on the side of the head. [...] The heavens shook with the thunder, and the Giant shook but stayed on his feet. [...] Then the elder of the two brothers shot a chain-lightning arrow at [...] [...] The Giant dropped to his knee, but stood again. [...] The second brother then shot an arrow of sheet lightning which struck the giant in the chest. [...] He fell to both knees and began to fall forward, catching himself with his hands. [...] Then the first brother shot a deadly sunbeam arrow and hit the Giant in the head. [...] fell face down on the ground. [...] Blood flowed in great streams from the Giant's mouth, and , the Wind said, [...] "Stop the blood before it reaches the water! It will become alive!" [...] The twins ran to block the flow of blood and it remains on the ground today near the spring at the foot of , the Blue Bead Mountain.|$|E
