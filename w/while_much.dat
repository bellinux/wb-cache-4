5|$|<b>While</b> <b>much</b> of the Loop's 19th-century {{architecture}} {{has been}} lost to demolition and redevelopment, the Rookery has been spared this fate {{through a series of}} well executed renovations.

5|$|During the 1930s–1950s {{heyday of}} the big Hollywood studios, {{the status of women}} in the {{industry}} was abysmal and, <b>while</b> <b>much</b> has improved, many would argue that there is still much to be done. From art films by Sally Potter, Catherine Breillat, Claire Denis and Jane Campion to action movies by Kathryn Bigelow, women now have a stronger voice, but are only too aware of the still lingering gender gap.|$|E
5|$|Flat Bastion Magazine {{had been}} {{abandoned}} for years when geology enthusiast Freddie Gomez undertook its restoration. Gomez, whose interests include both history and geology, converted the magazine to a geological research facility and exhibition centre. <b>While</b> <b>much</b> {{of the contents of}} the large collection of rocks and minerals are from his collection, other specimens have been donated. The men of the 150 (Yorkshire) Transport Regiment also spent a day performing repairs at the magazine. Gomez aspires to open the site to the public.|$|E

5|$|Hundreds {{of animals}} {{along the coast}} were coated with the thick crude oil and many died. State parks and beaches located along the {{coastline}} were temporarily closed. <b>While</b> <b>much</b> smaller than the oil rig blowout {{that resulted in the}} 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill, this spill may have greater long term effects due to its potential impact on four state marine protected areas.

5|$|In {{traditional}} times, Māori had a rich {{knowledge of}} the cabbage tree, including spiritual, ecological and many practical aspects of its use. <b>While</b> <b>much</b> of that specialised knowledge was lost after the European settlement of New Zealand, {{the use of the}} tree as food and medicine has persisted, and the use of its fibres for weaving is becoming more common.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1980s, however, Dayton's {{population}} has declined, mainly {{due to the}} loss of manufacturing jobs and decentralization of metropolitan areas, as well as the national housing crisis that began in 2008. <b>While</b> <b>much</b> of the state has suffered for similar reasons, the impact on Dayton has been greater than most. Dayton had the third-greatest percentage loss of population in the state since the 1980s, behind Cleveland and Youngstown. Despite this, Dayton has begun diversifying its workforce from manufacturing into other growing sectors such as healthcare and education.|$|E

With seeders too little seed reduces crop yields and increases weeds <b>while</b> too <b>much</b> seed increases cost and may reduce yields. With a pesticide application, too little product can mean poor control, <b>while</b> too <b>much</b> can mean crop injury, extra costs, and possible residue on the crop and/or carryover.

5|$|Tension between {{traditional}} Khitan {{social and political}} practices and Chinese influence and customs was {{a defining feature of}} the dynasty. This tension led to a series of succession crises; Liao emperors favored the Chinese concept of primogeniture, <b>while</b> <b>much</b> {{of the rest of the}} Khitan elite supported the traditional method of succession by the strongest candidate. So different were Khitan and Chinese practices that Abaoji set up two parallel governments. The Northern Administration governed Khitan areas following traditional Khitan practices, while the Southern Administration governed areas with large non-Khitan populations, adopting traditional Chinese governmental practices.|$|E
5|$|Today, <b>while</b> <b>much</b> of the {{foreshore}} {{along the}} base of the cliffs that were scaled by William Howe's men the morning of the battle has been taken over by industry, the Plains of Abraham themselves are preserved within one of Canada's National Urban Parks.

5|$|<b>While</b> <b>much</b> of the {{construction}} in these sites is consistent with common Pueblo architectural forms, including kivas, towers, and pit-houses, the space constrictions of these alcoves necessitated what {{seems to have been}} a far denser concentration of their populations. Mug House, a typical cliff dwelling of the period, was home to around 100 people who shared 94 small rooms and eight kivas built against each other and sharing many of their walls; builders in these areas maximized space in any way they could, with no areas considered off-limits to construction.|$|E
5|$|<b>While</b> <b>much</b> wetland habitat {{has been}} {{eliminated}} due to human activity, new muskrat habitat {{has been created}} by the construction of canals or irrigation channels, and the muskrat remains common and widespread. They are able to live alongside streams which contain the sulfurous water that drains away from coal mines. Fish and frogs perish in such streams, yet muskrats may thrive and occupy the wetlands. Muskrats also benefit from human persecution {{of some of their}} predators.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{including}} a Stalwart on the ticket, animosity between the Republican factions carried {{over from the}} convention, and Garfield traveled to New York to meet with party leaders there. After convincing the Stalwart crowd to put aside their differences and unite for the coming campaign, Garfield returned to Ohio, leaving the active campaigning to others, as was traditional at the time. Meanwhile, the Democrats settled on their nominee, Major General Winfield Scott Hancock of Pennsylvania, a career military officer. Hancock and the Democrats expected to carry the Solid South, <b>while</b> <b>much</b> of the North was considered safe territory for Garfield and the Republicans; most of the campaign would involve a few close states, including New York and Indiana.|$|E

5|$|Hancock and the Democrats {{expected}} {{to carry the}} Solid South, <b>while</b> <b>much</b> of the North was considered safe territory for Garfield and the Republicans; most of the campaign would involve a handful of close states, including New York {{and a few of}} the Midwestern states (national elections in that era were largely decided by closely divided states there). Practical differences between the major party candidates were few, and Republicans began the campaign with the familiar theme of waving the bloody shirt: reminding Northern voters that the Democratic Party was responsible for secession and four years of civil war, and that if they held power they would reverse the gains of that war, dishonor Union veterans, and pay Confederate soldiers' pensions out of the federal treasury. With fifteen years having passed since the end of the war, and Union generals at the head of all of the major and minor party tickets, the appeal to wartime loyalties was of diminishing value in exciting the voters.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the major}} {{architecture}} of the site core is covered by secondary forest, including some large trees, <b>while</b> <b>much</b> of the city's remains lie within the modern village, including mounds of various sizes. Some mounds were destroyed {{in order to build}} the modern streets, in other cases the mounds were robbed of stone that was reused in modern construction. There are also instances where modern houses have been built on top of ancient mound platforms. Modern houses had previously also occupied the outskirts of the acropolis but were relocated during the Guatemalan Civil War in the late 20th century due to guerrilla activity.|$|E
5|$|The changes seen {{in series}} VII were {{seen by some}} as a disappointment; <b>while</b> <b>much</b> slicker and higher-budget in appearance, the shift away from {{outright}} sitcom and into something approaching comedy drama was seen as a move in the wrong direction. Furthermore, the attempt to shift back into traditional sitcom format for series VIII was greeted with a response that was similarly lukewarm. There was criticism aimed at the decision to resurrect the entire crew of Red Dwarf, as it was felt this detracted from the series' central premise of Lister being the last human being alive. There are other critics who feel that series VII and VIII are no weaker than the earlier series, however, and the topic is the subject of constant fervent debate among the show's fanbase.|$|E
