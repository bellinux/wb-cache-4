5|$|Chapman {{was born}} in Kiveton Park, near Rotherham. His father, John, was a coal miner, but rather than spend his life working down the pit, the young Herbert <b>was</b> <b>bright</b> enough to win a place at Sheffield Technical College (later {{to become part of}} the University of Sheffield), where he studied mining engineering.|$|E
5|$|The {{bioluminescence}} of O.nidiformis fruit bodies is best seen in low-light conditions {{when the}} viewer's eyes have become dark-adapted. The gills {{are the most}} luminescent part of the fungus, emitting a greenish light that fades with age. Although {{the intensity of the}} luminescence is variable, William Henry Harvey once reported that it <b>was</b> <b>bright</b> enough to read a watch face by. It is not known if the mycelium is also luminescent.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 15 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>bright</b> deep orange, marbled with numerous dark lines. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>bright</b> orange, suffusedly margined with dark fuscous.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 40-42 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>bright</b> yellow, {{the base}} with a bluish-black shining streak. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>bright</b> yellow, the apical part dull brownish black.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 30-32 mm. The forewings <b>are</b> <b>bright</b> orange, but blue blackish at the base. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>bright</b> orange with a purple-blackish streak {{along the}} dorsum. The apical fifth is purple blackish.|$|R
5|$|A {{degree to}} the {{northwest}} of ζ Tauri is the Crab Nebula (M1), a supernova remnant. This expanding nebula was created by a Type II supernova explosion, which was seen from Earth on July 4, 1054. It <b>was</b> <b>bright</b> enough to be observed during the day, and is mentioned in Chinese historical texts. At its peak the supernova reached magnitude −4, but the nebula is currently magnitude 8.4 and requires a telescope to observe. North American peoples also observed the supernova, as evidenced from a painting on a New Mexican canyon and various pieces of pottery that depict the event. However, the remnant itself was not discovered until 1731, when John Bevis found it.|$|E
5|$|Besides Pluto, Makemake is {{the only}} other dwarf planet that <b>was</b> <b>bright</b> enough that Clyde Tombaugh could have {{detected}} it during his search for trans-Neptunian planets around 1930. At the time of Tombaugh's survey, Makemake {{was only a few}} degrees from the ecliptic, near the border of Taurus and Auriga, at an apparent magnitude of 16.0. This position, however, was also very near the Milky Way, and Makemake would have been almost impossible to find against the dense background of stars. Tombaugh continued searching for some years after the discovery of Pluto, but he did not find Makemake or any other trans-Neptunian objects.|$|E
5|$|Kappa Pyxidis was catalogued but {{not given}} a Bayer {{designation}} by Lacaille, however Gould felt the star <b>was</b> <b>bright</b> {{enough to warrant}} a letter. Kappa has a magnitude of 4.62 and is 560 ± 50 light-years distant. An orange giant of spectral type K4/K5III, Kappa has a luminosity approximately 965 {{times that of the}} Sun. It is separated by 2.1 arcseconds from a magnitude 10 star. Theta Pyxidis is a red giant of spectral type M1III and semi-regular variable with two measured periods of 13 and 98.3 days, and an average magnitude of 4.71, and is 500 ± 30 light-years distant from Earth. It has expanded to approximately 54 times the diameter of the Sun.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is about 17 mm. The ground colour of the forewings <b>is</b> <b>bright</b> shining turquoise, the costa and termen broadly black. The hindwings <b>are</b> <b>bright</b> shining turquoise, the termen broadly black.|$|R
50|$|Altogether three {{regions of}} HRD are present here: low mass {{end of the}} main sequence, {{complete}} red giant branch and horizontal branch. In infrared red stars <b>are</b> <b>brighter,</b> that's why red stars <b>are</b> <b>brighter</b> in this diagram making the lower main sequence shallower than usual. On the other hand, the horizontal branch becomes steeper in this diagram due to IR effects (on the HB the blue end is fainter and the red end <b>is</b> <b>brighter).</b>|$|R
5|$|Coma Berenices <b>is</b> not {{particularly}} <b>bright,</b> as {{none of its}} stars <b>are</b> <b>brighter</b> than fourth magnitude, although there <b>are</b> 66 stars <b>brighter</b> {{than or equal to}} apparent magnitude6.5.|$|R
5|$|While sailing {{in these}} latitudes on one very dark night, the sea {{presented}} a wonderful and most beautiful spectacle. There was a fresh breeze, and {{every part of}} the surface, which during the day is seen as foam, now glowed with a pale light. The vessel drove before her bows two billows of liquid phosphorus, and in her wake she was followed by a milky train. As far as the eye reached, the crest of every wave <b>was</b> <b>bright,</b> and the sky above the horizon, from the reflected glare of these livid flames, was not so utterly obscure, as over the rest of the heavens.|$|E

25|$|Founder Pat Metheny first {{emerged on}} the jazz {{scene in the}} mid-1970s {{with a pair of}} solo albums. First <b>was</b> <b>Bright</b> Size Life, {{released}} in 1976, a trio album with bass guitarist Jaco Pastorius and drummer Bob Moses. The next album, released in 1977, was Watercolors, featuring Eberhard Weber on bass, pianist Lyle Mays, and drummer Danny Gottlieb.|$|E

25|$|The Contradanza is a {{communal}} sequence dance, with the dance figures conforming {{to a set}} pattern. The selection of figures for a particular dance was usually set by a master of ceremonies or dance leader. There were two parts of 16 bars each, danced in a line or square format. The tempo and style of the music <b>was</b> <b>bright</b> and fairly fast.|$|E
25|$|The other outer suburbs {{district}} that fell to Labor <b>was</b> <b>Bright,</b> {{which had been}} held since 1989 by former Liberal energy minister Wayne Matthew, who decided to retire at this election. The seat was contested for the Liberals by Legislative Council member Angus Redford, who faced a tougher fight than expected. He was defeated by Labor's Chloë Fox, who received a 14.4 percent swing on a two party preferred basis, {{the largest in the}} state.|$|E
25|$|The hall {{they built}} used modernism’s {{favourite}} material, reinforced concrete, alongside more luxurious elements including beautiful woods and Derbyshire fossilised limestone. The {{exterior of the}} building <b>was</b> <b>bright</b> white, intended to contrast with the blackened city surrounding it. Large areas of glass on its façade meant that light coursed freely throughout the interior, and at night, the glass let the light from inside flood out onto the river, {{in contrast to the}} darkness which befell the rest of London after dusk.|$|E

25|$|Still {{searching for}} a single-tube {{solution}} that <b>was</b> <b>bright</b> enough for direct viewing, in 1942 Baird hit upon the Telechrome concept. His solution was essentially to combine two tubes into one large spherical enclosure. In {{the center of the}} enclosure was a translucent mica sheet forming the display, covered on one side with cyan phosphor, the other with an orange-red color, producing a limited but useful color gamut. Two electron guns arranged {{on either side of the}} screen fired at it, producing the two colors. The image was viewed from one side, seeing one of the colors directly and the other being transmitted through the screen from the other side. This was the first single-tube color television system.|$|E
25|$|John Bright was the {{greatest}} of all parliamentary orators. He had many political successes. Along with Richard Cobden, he conducted the campaign which led to the repeal of the Corn Laws. He did more than any other man to prevent the intervention of this country (Britain) {{on the side of the}} South during the American Civil War, and he headed the reform agitation in 1867 which brought the industrial working class within the pale of the constitution. It <b>was</b> <b>Bright</b> who made possible the Liberal party of Gladstone, Asquith and Lloyd George, and the alliance between middle class idealism and trade unionism, which he promoted, still lives in the present-day Labour Party.|$|E
25|$|Charles marched by Bridgnorth, Lichfield and Ashbourne to Doncaster, {{where on}} 18 August he {{was met by}} great numbers of Yorkshire gentlemen with {{promises}} of fresh recruits. For a moment the outlook <b>was</b> <b>bright,</b> for the Derbyshire men with Gell were far away at Worcester with Leven, the Yorkshire Parliamentarians engaged in besieging Scarborough and Pontefract castles and other posts. But two days later he heard that David Leslie with the cavalry of Leven's army was coming up behind him, and that, the Yorkshire sieges being now ended, Major-General Poyntz's force lay in his front. It was now impossible {{to wait for the}} new levies, and reluctantly the King turned back to Oxford, raiding Huntingdonshire (the home county of Oliver Cromwell) {{and other parts of the}} hated Eastern Association en route.|$|E

25|$|The Australians {{began their}} chase {{of the target}} of 183 disastrously. Veteran bowler Malcolm Nash had opener Richie Robinson lbw for a second ball duck, and had Kim Hughes caught behind two balls later for a golden duck. Australia ended the first over on 2 for 0. Ian Davis and David Hookes tried to rebuild their innings, but both had also soon departed. Doug Walters also went cheaply, and {{it was left to}} spinners Ray Bright and Kerry O'Keeffe to offer the only resistance, putting on a {{partnership}} of over 40. The only highlight in an otherwise disastrous innings <b>was</b> <b>Bright</b> bringing up his 1000th first-class run. Australia survived a torrid attack from Nash to reach stumps on 86 for 6 off 29 overs, Nash claiming 5 for 32.|$|E
25|$|I get {{the tune}} and then I {{just keep on}} singing the tune until the words come out from the tune. It's kind of a {{hypnotic}} state that you reach after a while when you keep on playing it where words just evolve from it. So you take those words and just let them go whichever way they want...'Moonshadow'? Funny, that was in Spain, I went there alone, completely alone, {{to get away from}} a few things. And I was dancin' on the rocks there... right on the rocks where the waves were, like, blowin' and splashin'. Really, it was so fantastic. And the moon <b>was</b> <b>bright,</b> ya know, and I started dancin' and singin' and I sang that song and it stayed. It's just the kind of moment that you want to find when you're writin' songs.|$|E
500|$|After {{advancing}} to the league championship game in five {{out of the past}} six seasons, the Giants financial outlook <b>was</b> <b>bright</b> heading into the 1964 season. The team {{even went so far as}} to book movie theaters where fans could watch the team's games for six dollars. However, the team struggled mightily, finishing 2–10–2 in 1964, beginning an 18-season playoff drought. This period in team history is often referred to as [...] "the wilderness years". In 1965, Jack Mara died, leaving his 50% share in the team to his son Tim.|$|E
30|$|If these sensors are {{to become}} a reality, however, the TL emitted must <b>be</b> <b>bright.</b> Of the {{hundreds}} of known triboluminescent materials, only a few <b>are</b> <b>bright</b> enough to <b>be</b> seen in daylight.

This material has 206 % of the TL yield compared to ZnS:Mn subjected to low-energy impacts [11]. However, due to its organic nature, EuD 4 TEA {{appears to be more}} easily damaged than ZnS:Mn [11].|$|R
