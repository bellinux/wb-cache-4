5|$|While {{the exact}} reason for such {{prolonged}} construction {{time is not}} known, {{it is believed that}} reduction of the French Navy's budget after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870â€“71 and out-of-date work practices in French dockyards <b>were</b> <b>likely</b> causes.|$|E
5|$|All {{three letters}} of John <b>were</b> <b>likely</b> written {{within a few}} years of each other, and {{internal}} evidence indicates that they were written after the Gospel of John, placing them {{in the second half of}} the first century. This dating makes sense given their allusions and opposition to Gnostic and docetic teaching, which denied the full humanity of Jesus, and which was gaining ascendancy at the end of the first century.|$|E
5|$|Alternative {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} for the diet of aetosaurs. In 1947, H J Sawin proposed that the aetosaur Longosuchus was a scavenger based on the close proximity of some specimens to {{a large number of}} skeletons that <b>were</b> <b>likely</b> carcasses. A 2009 study of the jaw biomechanics of the South American genus Neoaetosauroides suggested that the animal may have fed on larvae and insects without hard exoskeletons. This is because Neoaetosauroides lacks serrations or wear facets on the teeth and has a jaw leverage that is not designed for strong forces such as crushing and chopping. The study recognized that northern aetosaurs such as Desmatosuchus and Stagonolepis did have jaws that would have supported a strong musculature, and <b>were</b> <b>likely</b> better suited to eating plant material.|$|E

5|$|Among pterodactyloids {{a greater}} {{variation}} in diet is present. Pteranodontia contained many piscivorous taxa, such as ornithocheirans, boreopterids, pteranodontids and nyctosaurids. Some amount of niche partitioning {{seems to have}} been present: ornithocheirans and the later nyctosaurs were aerial dip-feeders like today's frigatebirds, while boreopterids were freshwater diving animals similar to cormorants or Platanista river dolphins, and pteranodonts were pelagic plunge-divers akin to boobies and gannets. The biggest exception among this group are the istiodactylids, which <b>were</b> <b>likely</b> primarily scavengers.|$|E
5|$|As Tropical Depression 07W, locally named 'Henry' by PAGASA, {{neared the}} provence the {{northern}} Philippines, {{a total of}} 17 provinces were placed under a storm alert as winds of 30kts (55km/h) <b>were</b> <b>likely</b> to affect areas near the depression.

5|$|Heterodontosauridae is {{a family}} of early ornithischian dinosaurs that <b>were</b> <b>likely</b> among the most basal (primitive) members of the group.
