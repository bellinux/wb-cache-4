500|$|Overjoyed with victory, Falcons players also wept {{after the}} game, {{and the team}} ripped open pillows and threw {{feathers}} in celebration on their charter flight back to Atlanta. Buchanan stated that the win [...] "feels like a miracle" [...] due to the negative perception of the Falcons in years past. [...] "This team was dirt. People stepped on us and wiped their feet on the doormat. Now <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> a bunch of Michael Jordans." [...] Chandler joked that due to his game-winning field goal, Morten Andersen [...] "gets to keep his green card," [...] referring to Andersen's Danish nationality, while running back Jamal Anderson felt vindicated for the media's continuous focus on the Vikings {{in the days leading}} up to the game, which made him feel disrespected.|$|E
500|$|... "Sick Cycle Carousel" [...] was {{described}} as being a rock song with an influence of soft rock. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, the song is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 92 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of A minor with Wade's vocal range spanning from the low-note of C4 to the high-note of G5. The song has a basic chord progression of F–G–Am7–F–G–Am7. John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout called it [...] "a song about the preverbial merry go round <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> we're on when we keep committing the same sins over and over". Liana Jonas of Allmusic applauded on how Aniello and O'Brien [...] "brought Wade's vocals and lyrics {{to the forefront of}} the mix" [...] for all the songs on the album.|$|E
500|$|The show's website {{released}} a motion comic {{based on the}} first issue of the original comic and voiced by Phil LaMarr. The site also posted a making-of documentary, and other behind-the-scenes videos and interviews. In the documentary, Kirkman as well as artist Charlie Adlard expressed pleasure that the show is faithful to the comic and remark on the similarities between the actors and the comic's original character drawings. Several scenes were screened July 23, 2010 as part of the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International. Hurd asserted that [...] " [...] really are doing six one-hour movies", and Darabont insisted that the series would closely reflect the development in the comics. [...] "The path is a very strong template. But we're going to take every interesting detour <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> taking. As long as were staying on the path of what Robert has done, I don't see any reason not to. If they have patience we'll eventually catch up to what Robert is doing." ...|$|E

500|$|Musically, {{the band}} {{regarded}} the album as a 'new progression'. Bassist Nathan Cochran said that [...] "It’s not a sharp left turn; it’s a step beyond what we’ve ever done. <b>We</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> our message and calling are the same... We’re still worship leaders; we’re {{just on a}} different scale". As a whole, Undone is a guitar-driven album with a pop rock and adult contemporary sound. The album's opening track, [...] "Where You Lead Me", builds from an acoustic guitar-driven opening into a crescendo featuring synthesizers and guitars. [...] "Here with Me" [...] has a musical vibe similar to alternative rock band Coldplay. [...] "Homesick" [...] is a ballad featuring strings from the London Symphony Orchestra. More upbeat cuts on the album include [...] "In The Blink Of An Eye", [...] "Caught Up In The Middle", and [...] "A Million Miles Away", while [...] "Keep Singing" [...] is driven by a piano.|$|E
500|$|In 1917, {{the black}} writer W. E. B. Du Bois {{observed}} {{that the impact of}} [...] "ever-recurring race discrimination" [...] had made it so difficult to travel to any number of destinations, from popular resorts to major cities, that it was now [...] "a puzzling query as to what to do with vacations". It was a problem that came to affect an increasing number of black people in {{the first decades of the}} 20th century. Tens of thousands of southern African Americans migrated from farms in the south to factories and domestic service in the north. No longer confined to living at a subsistence level, many gained enough disposable income and time to engage in leisure travel. The development of affordable mass-produced automobiles liberated black Americans from having to rely on the [...] "Jim Crow cars" [...] – smoky, battered and uncomfortable railroad carriages which were the separate but decidedly unequal alternatives to more salubrious whites-only carriages. As one black magazine writer commented in 1933, in an automobile [...] "it's mighty good to be the skipper for a change, and pilot our craft whither and where we will. <b>We</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> Vikings. What if our craft is blunt of nose and limited of power and our sea is macademized; it's good for the spirit to just give the old railroad Jim Crow the laugh." ...|$|E
500|$|In the episode, the {{character}} of Sheriff Graham was killed off, something that actor Jamie Dornan had known would happen since ABC picked up the pilot. It {{was the first major}} death of the series. In an interview with E! reporter Kristin Dos Santos, Dornan hinted that while his counterpart in Storybrooke has died, the huntsman could return at some point, as Dornan is still a regular on the series. As much of the episode involves Graham discovering his fairytale past, the writers designed the episode to mislead viewers by having them invest in {{the character}}. Kitsis and Horowitz commented that while the death made them [...] "sad," [...] the battle between Emma and Regina requires [...] "stakes and unfortunately, sometimes stakes are people's lives." [...] They also decided to kill the character relatively early in the series in order to show viewers that [...] "it's real. It's not in Henry's head." [...] Kitsis continued, [...] "It’s interesting, but part of the intent was to make you love him and we loved him very much. And the fact that the audience seems to have loved him means a lot to us, in that <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> we succeeded on that front. If you don’t feel sad, then it was a failure of the execution of the story." ...|$|E

5000|$|DeJohnette, also {{speaking}} to the San Francisco Chronicle, recalled that the trio had agreed to [...] "do this until <b>we</b> don't <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> doing this anymore". In 2008, the trio celebrated its 25th anniversary, becoming during that time [...] "the preeminent jazz group interpreting standards".|$|R

500|$|Writing for the Hartford Courant, Malcolm Johnson stated, [...] "Against all odds, this long-delayed {{film version}} {{turns out to}} be a labor of love for {{director}} Alan Parker and for his stars, the reborn Madonna, the new superstar Antonio Banderas, the protean veteran Jonathan Pryce." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, writing [...] "Parker's visuals enliven the music, and Madonna and Banderas bring it passion. By the end of the film <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> we've had our money's worth, and we're sure Evita has." [...] On the syndicated television program Siskel & Ebert & the Movies, Ebert and his colleague Gene Siskel gave the film a [...] "two thumbs up" [...] rating. Siskel, in his review for the Chicago Tribune, wrote, [...] "Director Alan Parker has mounted this production well, which is more successful as spectacle than anything else." [...] According to Time magazine's Richard Corliss, [...] "This Evita is not just a long, complex music video; it works and breathes like a real movie, with characters worthy of our affection and deepest suspicions." [...] Critic Zach Conner commented, [...] "It's a relief to say that Evita is pretty damn fine, well-cast, and handsomely visualized. Madonna once again confounds our expectations. She plays Evita with a poignant weariness and has more than just a bit of star quality. Love or hate Madonna-Eva, she is a magnet for all eyes." ...|$|E
500|$|The short parodies Superman, with John Williams' {{theme from}} the 1978 film playing as Wilson {{changes in the}} booth. It was noted that Leitch's [...] "icy blue" [...] {{cinematography}} differed from the style that director Tim Miller used for the first Deadpool, on which Wernick said [...] "every director brings their take to the material" [...] and they were embracing and writing to his style. The writers wanted {{the opening of the}} short to feel like the opening of Logan, [...] "so {{if you were going to}} see Logan and the first shot came up, you would think it's gonna be Hugh [...] in the hoodie, and then when it turns out to be Deadpool you realize what's going on." [...] They described the short as an absurd one-off [...] "that's probably something that doesn't fit into a movie. It wouldn't work in the logic of a movie, but Deadpool affords us the opportunity to break rules ... the tone can be more absurd if <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> it's funny. That was our goal there." [...] The short makes several references to Logan: it is set in front of a theater that is showing the film; a poster for the film is seen in the alley; and Deadpool does an impersonation of Jackman's natural Australian accent. At the end of the short, an apparent book report summarizing Ernest Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea and seemingly written by Deadpool is quickly shown in a text crawl. This was interpreted to be an allusion to Logan and that film's focus on older characters.|$|E
2500|$|Elements of {{the album}} dated back {{to the end of}} the songwriting process for the {{previous}} album, Given to the Rising. Scott Kelly explained that the band continued to [...] "overwrite and then start subtracting ...As far back as I can remember, there's always been an initial sort of reflection on where we were with the previous record and what <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> doing, where <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> we could be better. [...] We sort of let that settle in and then let the music go as it wishes". [...] Von Till explained that the lengthy songwriting process, which took over 5 years, was important to achieving the end result: [...] "For these songs, we had to kind of let them reconstitute themselves or transform into a new shape over time...It's basically finding the opportunities to surrender ourselves to that kind of tangible spirit that drives everything we do".|$|E

2500|$|The {{facility}} may be {{best known}} as simply [...] "The Swamp", a nickname which was coined by Spurrier in 1992. As he explained at the time, [...] "A swamp is where Gators live.

2500|$|In March 2001—less {{than a month}} {{away from}} a United States tour set to {{commence}} on April 14—at the peak of their popularity and following a world tour, At the Drive-In broke up, initially referring to the split as an [...] "indefinite hiatus." [...] The band played their last show at Groningen's Vera venue on February 21, 2001. A combination of excessive hype, relentless touring, artistic differences, and Rodriguez-Lopez and Bixler-Zavala's drug habits contributed {{to the demise of}} the band. Commenting on the hiatus, guitarist Rodriguez said: [...] "After a non-stop six-year cycle of record/tour/record/tour, we are going on an indefinite hiatus. We need time to rest up and re-evaluate, just to be human beings again and to decide when <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> playing music again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thalassa, Le Calvaire de feu {{is noted}} for its {{numerous}} cultural references, and especially for using {{a wide range of}} metaphors. Such aspects have been reviewed negatively by modern critics. Tudor Vianu writes: [...] "the poet makes such waste of gemstones that <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> saying some of them must be false", while Călinescu, who notes that some fragments reveal [...] "an incomparable artist" [...] and [...] "a professional metaphorist", notes that [...] "in the end, such virtuosities become a bore." [...] According to Manuela-Delia Suciu, Thalassa is [...] "prolix" [...] and [...] "too polished", traits believed by Zamfir to be less irritating in the Romanian version. Critic Cornel Moraru found that, in the background, Thalassa, a [...] "great Symbolist novel", confronts Ancient Greek and Christian mythology, but [...] "abuses" [...] the religious vocabulary. Another part of the novel's imagery is erotic, and includes an elaborate and aestheticized description of male genitalia.|$|E
2500|$|Rygg, commenting in Unrestrained magazine, said, [...] "The first song, “Eos,” is an {{embellishment}} of a {{piece that}} we did for a funeral theme in the movie Uno. So {{you can use the}} same source material in different contexts. If you're in a different place at a different time and in a different frame of mind you can use stuff that originally didn't go anywhere, and make something of it. So yeah, we keep everything, but, man, it's a lot of music and ideas lying on the backups these days. I'm guessing 10 per cent of what we start ends up as something presentable. <b>We</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> a lot of things are interesting for 30 seconds or so, but then what?

40|$|The {{current study}} {{investigated}} the effect of priming people with alignment or distance to ideal self attributes on their feelings of authenticity. The effect of priming participants with self-irrelevant alignment or distance to ideal attributes was also explored, to test whether these manipulations might respectively increase or lower state authenticity, or whether state authenticity would only be affected by self-relevant priming. As expected, discrepant conditions were associated with lower state authenticity than non-discrepant conditions. Participants primed with self-relevant alignment to ideal self attributes felt more authentic than participants in any other condition, a relationship which was partially mediated by negative affect. Contrary to expectations, participants in the self-relevant discrepant condition experienced more authenticity, on average, than participants in the self-irrelevant discrepant condition, but the positive main effect of self-relevancy on state authenticity became non-significant once individual differences were added as covariates, while the interaction between self-relevancy and discrepancy became significant. The study {{is consistent with the}} idea that <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> more <b>like</b> our real selves when <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> more <b>like</b> our ideal selves...|$|R

2500|$|The {{members of}} Our Lady Peace began writing new {{material}} together {{soon after the}} Gravity tour began. In October 2002 they returned briefly to Bob Rock's Maui studio to record two unfinished songs from Gravity that were planned to be released on a soundtrack, which never happened. [...] "Working with him on that soundtrack song was just another reaffirmation for us how well we work together," [...] Maida stated in an October interview. [...] "With the way this band has grown, and the way we've come to trust Bob, it would be ridiculous for us to look for another producer now. When we're all together, <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> we can do anything. We have to go {{at least one more}} round with him. I think we just scratched the surface of what we can do together." [...] By the end of 2002, the band was eager to re-enter the studio in Maui to begin laying down demos with Rock. Two new songs, [...] "Not Afraid" [...] and [...] "Talk is Cheap" [...] were premiered in March 2003 while touring in Europe with Avril Lavigne.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{departure}} from Geffen, the band {{has continued to}} tour. During the summer of 2009, they launched the ambitious Saturday Night Rebel Rockers Traveling Circus and Medicine Show tour with longtime Bay Area friend Michael Franti, his band Spearhead, and the band Augustana. Instead of the traditional concert format of a short set by an opening act, followed by a longer set from a main supporting act, and then a long set by the headlining band, the shows featured members {{of all of the}} bands joining each other for songs from each bands' catalogs at various points throughout the evening. As Duritz explained in a welcoming message on the official website for the tour, each show [...] "is going to start with EVERYONE onstage together and we're going to all be running on & off stage all night playing one each other's songs all together and basically just playing whenever <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> playing." [...] The success of the first tour spawned a second in the summer of 2010 with Counting Crows and Augustana joined by rock/hip-hop artist (and formally trained jazz trumpeter) NOTAR, whom Duritz had signed to his independent Tyrannosaurus Records label, in place of Franti & Spearhead.|$|E
2500|$|Also citing McFly as {{influences}} are British pop {{rock band}} The Vamps, who supported McFly on their 2013 [...] Guitarist and vocalist James McVey stated [...] "McFly is a band {{we love to}} be compared to over other bands, simply for the fact of their good musicianship. They write very well and they're very energetic on stage, which is something we try to replicate in our own performances." [...] Drummer Tristan Evans also spoke of the band, explaining [...] "McFly were an influence on me wanting to get into music and <b>we</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> {{the next generation of}} their take on pop," [...] while bassist Connor Ball continued [...] "They're chilled-out and we hope we can have that calm attitude if we ever get that successful." [...] Frontman Brad Simpson also referred to McFly when asked about influences, stating [...] "Their debut album was a first in all of our collections". The band credited their support slot as providing an opportunity to observe the band's skills for their own development. Simpson said [...] "How to provide more energy to our performance and move around the stage was a massive one...McFly have been doing it for years and the little things we picked up have really improved our live performance." [...] McVey also referred to the band's influence on performances by the Vamps, stating [...] "Before I had seen them in concert, I would never have performed as we do now." [...] The Vamps have covered several songs by McFly in a series of YouTube videos including Love Is Easy, performed alongside Fletcher's sister Carrie Hope Fletcher, [...] "That Girl", filmed as a recreation of the music video including appearances from Poynter, and finally [...] "Five Colours in Her Hair", which featured on the digital EP for their second single [...] "Wild Heart". Their debut album, Meet the Vamps featured the song [...] "High Hopes" [...] which was co-written by Fletcher, Jones and Poynter and produced by Jones. When The Vamps were compared to Australian band 5 Seconds of Summer, Simpson said [...] "We both have a shared admiration for McFly. They've shaped the music of our generation...
