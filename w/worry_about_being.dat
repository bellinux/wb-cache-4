25|$|As she {{had been}} already working on a {{successful}} serial, the gothic mystery manga Earl Cain, she faced opposition towards her wish to begin another. Initially, she was allowed only ten installments of Angel Sanctuary, which led her to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>being</b> able to properly end the story. At that time, she had the character development up to Zaphikel's death scene and fragments of the plot. She {{found it difficult to}} construct a story to join the scenes she wanted to draw. Additionally, the original character designs underwent changes, only Kato's remained unchanged. Several angels were planned to make an appearance, but never did; among them were the Angel of the Yoke and the leader of the angels, Sakaki.|$|E

[...] This directness was noted by others, including bassist Chubby Jackson, who commented that Tristano {{had almost no}} tact and would not <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>being</b> rude or making others feel incompetent. Some of his students described Tristano as domineering, but others indicated that this impression came from his demanding discipline in training and attitude to music.|$|E
500|$|Brandon Sanderson's {{review in}} The Official Time Waster's Guide cites the comic's world design, {{longevity}} and a discomforting setting where intelligent animals are killed as strengths. However, Sanderson also complained that Holbrook does not enforce this aspect {{in the main}} characters, saying, [...] "While Kell, Rudy, and others make kills every day, none of the main character herbivores ever really have to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>being</b> stalked and killed. When they are threatened (such as when Lindesfarne is stalked by some cougars {{near the beginning of}} the comic's run), the enemy predators are presented as dark, evil things to be defeated.…This sense of careless, off-handed killing gives the comic a lot of its humor—however, to maintain that air of humor, Bill never allows the society to work its everyday worst on any of the main characters." ...|$|E

500|$|Writing in the New Law Journal, Chris Pamplin {{called the}} {{decision}} [...] "unprincipled" [...] {{and argued that}} the decision [...] "threatens the very foundation of witness immunity", based on an out-of-date view of the expert witness as a [...] "hired gun". [...] Pamplin's view was that the majority had [...] "ignored the fundamental difference" [...] between experts and advocates, saying that advocates {{had no choice but}} to continue in the legal system whereas experts could continue their ordinary work without needing to carry on as an expert witness. [...] Therefore, experts would be more likely to abandon such work than advocates, making them more vulnerable to vexatious litigation. [...] However, he said it would make [...] "little immediate difference" [...] for many experts, since [...] "conscientious professionals" [...] would have little <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>being</b> found negligent and would have insurance in case they were. The ruling would also help develop a [...] "professional class of expert", making it less likely that people would contribute expertise occasionally, and although a professional expert witness would have a better knowledge of their role and duties, this would be at the expense of [...] "freshness and challenge to dogma".|$|E
500|$|Chloe Sullivan was {{introduced}} by the show's creators to be a [...] "Lois Lane archetype", as well as be Smallvilles [...] "outsider", which series developers Gough and Millar felt the show {{needed in order to}} have a character that notices the strange happenings in Smallville. She is the original creation of Al Gough and Miles Miller, having not been produced first in the DC Comics Universe, unlike the other main characters Clark Kent, Lana Lang, Lex Luthor, and Pete Ross. When they first began developing the series, Gough and Millar had intended for Chloe to have an [...] "ethnic background". After learning about Smallville from the show's casting director, Dee Dee Bradley, Allison Mack toyed with the idea of auditioning for the role of Lana Lang, but chose instead to audition for the role of Chloe Sullivan. Gough and Millar felt she had a [...] "rare ability to deliver large chunks of expositionary [...] dialogue conversationally", and decided to cast her against their initial intention to give the character an ethnic origin. According to Mack, the reason she got the role was because she went into her second audition with a [...] "very flippant attitude". Kristen Bell also auditioned for the role of Chloe Sullivan; she would eventually go on to star in the television series Veronica Mars. Aside from Allison Mack, Roan Curtis portrayed Chloe as a child in the season six episode [...] "Progeny", with Victoria Duffield taking on the role in the eighth season episode [...] "Abyss". Mack enjoys the fact that her character was created specifically for the show, because she feels like she does not have to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>being</b> compared to someone else in the same role, which she likens to people comparing Michael Rosenbaum's performance as Lex Luthor to Gene Hackman's portrayal in the Superman film series of the 1970s – 1980s. Mack only signed on for five episodes of the tenth and final season.|$|E
500|$|Insane Clown Posse {{sued the}} FBI, whose National Gang Intelligence Center listed Juggalos as [...] "a loosely {{organized}} hybrid gang" [...] in a 2011 report. The report states that Juggalos are [...] "recognized as a gang in only four states... {{law enforcement officials}} in at least 21 states have identified criminal Juggalo sub-sets". The report also noted that New Mexico was {{seeing a lot of}} Juggalo gang expansion due to their attraction to [...] "the tribal and cultural traditions of the Native Americans". The lawsuit asks for the documents that the FBI used to reach this conclusion; in August 2013, federal authorities had [...] "filed a motion to dismiss the case, saying they had already released several news media reports about Juggalos involved in criminal activity". The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan is working with ICP's lawyers in order [...] "to ensure the right of Juggalos everywhere to gather together and express their support of the I.C.P. without having to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>being</b> unfairly targeted and harassed by law enforcement". On January 8, 2014, Insane Clown Posse, along with the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, filed suit again against the FBI. The suit aims to have Juggalos no longer considered to be a gang and to have any [...] "criminal intelligence information" [...] about Juggalos destroyed. ICP announced in the edition of December 21, 2012 of the Hatchet Herald that they will be releasing a sideshow EP to The Mighty Death Pop! in 2013. After no word was heard on the album, it was speculated that it had been scrapped. In mid 2013 it was announced that ICP would be releasing their first ever box set titled The First Six. After the release date came and passed, The First Six was not released. In a February 2014 interview with Faygoluvers, the question was asked if {{we would be able to}} get the box set. ICP thought it had already been released. Dog Beats (the first ever release on Psychopathic Records) was set to be the bonus album in the box set, ICP went back and decided to put House of Wax in the box set instead. The First Six was set to be released on October 28, 2014. After a minor setback, was ultimately released on November 25, 2014.|$|E

2500|$|As the American {{commitment}} waned {{there was}} an increasing media emphasis on Vietnamization, the South Vietnamese government, and casualties - both American and Vietnamese.

These stories increased in number as U.S. soldiers [...] "began to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>being</b> the last casualty in the lame-duck war." [...] The U.S. military resented the attention and at first refused to believe that the problems were as bad as correspondents portrayed them.

[...] Being appointed to and maintaining the position of tlatoani was based on the ability to rule decisively; he could be replaced by another noble if he failed to do so. [...] At any sign of weakness, Aztec nobles within Tenochtitlan and in other Aztec tributaries were liable to rebel. [...] As Moctezuma complied with orders issued by Cortés, such as commanding tribute to be gathered and given to the Spaniards, his authority was slipping, and quickly his people began to turn against him.|$|E

2500|$|In late 2007, Sen Sharma {{acted in}} two movies under the Yash Raj Films banner. She noted her {{excitement}} toward these two projects as {{these were the}} first films {{in which she had}} to lip-sync for songs. In the first one, Laaga Chunari Mein Daag, a drama directed by Pradeep Sarkar, she portrayed the character of a Banaras small town young woman, Chutki, alongside Rani Mukerji. The film was a critical and commercial failure in India, even though her performance was received well. The second one was Aaja Nachle, which was widely promoted as the comeback film of Madhuri Dixit. The film did not do well. Rajeev Masand from CNN-IBN noted her performance in the film as being [...] "...nothing short of fantastic.

25|$|The proper policy, in my view, {{should be}} to affirm the status of physician-assisted suicide and {{euthanasia}} as illegal. In so doing we would affirm that as a society we condemn ending a patient's life and do not consider that to have one's life ended by a doctor is a right. This does not mean we deny that in exceptional cases interventions are appropriate, as acts of desperation when all other elements of treatment—all medications, surgical procedures, psychotherapy, spiritual care, and so on—have been tried. Physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia should not be performed simply because a patient is depressed, tired of life, <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>being</b> a burden, or <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> <b>being</b> dependent.

[...] The sutra argues that all sentient beings are connected to enlightenment. [...] Because everyone is connected to the goal enlightenment, one would never have to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>being</b> disconnected from the path of enlightenment. [...] Since those who recite the sutra reportedly recite the exact words that the Buddha spoke during his lifetime, the person who recites the text offers his or her voice to serve as a channel by which the Buddha’s presence within his teachings can spread across the world. [...] Prior to the discovery of the Sanskrit original in 1931 the Khotanese translation was the oldest surviving manuscript of the sutra.
