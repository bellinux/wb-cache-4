5|$|The {{discovery}} of Neptune in 1846 {{led to the}} discrediting of the Titius–Bode law {{in the eyes of}} scientists, because its orbit <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>near</b> the predicted position.

However more runners-up medals came from the FA Cup and the European Cup Winners' Cup. After Bremner scored the only goal of the semi-final clash with Wolves, Leeds went on to lose the FA Cup final 1–0 to Second Division Sunderland. They were then beaten 1–0 by Italian side A.C. Milan at the Kaftanzoglio Stadium in the European Cup Winners' Cup Final, though Bremner missed the final due to suspension.|$|E
5|$|On 11–12 August 2012, the Saturday and Sunday {{prior to}} {{the launch of the}} second series of Red or Black?, ITV {{suffered}} the worst weekend in its 57-year history due to BBC One's coverage of the 2012 Summer Olympics; it was beaten to second place in the primetime league tables by BBC Three {{for the first time ever}} and the only ITV programme on 11 August that was one of the channel's 30 most watched in the week 6–12 August 2012 was the ITV News at Ten. The Olympics closing ceremony the following night gave BBC One more than 20 times the audience share of ITV.

5|$|On 24 April, {{the first}} {{prisoner}} {{escaped from the}} main camp; {{the same day that}} the injured second prisoner was taken in by Machuca and his men. Interrogation of the new prisoner, {{who turned out to be}} an Itza nobleman, revealed that the Itza kingdom was in a state of high alert to repel the Spanish. Friar Cano met with his fellow Dominicans to discuss what should be done, having had information from both Machuca and his prisoner that the Itza were ready for war. The Dominicans were highly critical of the Spanish soldiers' readiness to open fire on poorly armed natives who offered no real threat to them, and suspected that President Barrios <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>near</b> the lake; furthermore the Spanish were beginning to succumb to sickness, and the Verapaz Indian recruits were deserting daily. Díaz agreed with the Dominicans; two muleteers had already died from sickness, and he recognised that the size of his expedition was not sufficient for a full confrontation with the Itza nation. The expedition almost immediately withdrew back to Cahabón. The new prisoner, AjK'ixaw was later taken back to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, where the Dominicans questioned him in detail. In Guatemala AjK'ixaw learnt Spanish and returned to Petén in 1696 as a guide and interpreter for another expedition, before turning on his captors. After the Spanish retreated to Guatemala, rumours ran rife among the Itza and Kowoj that they would return to engage in wholesale slaughter of the Maya population; large tracts of territory were abandoned in response, including many towns in an area stretching from Lake Petén Itzá eastwards to Tipuj and southwards to Mopán.|$|E

25|$|Between August and December, the Eighth Army slowly progressed up {{the east}} coast. The Polish II Corps {{captured}} the important port-city of Ancona, thus significantly shortening the allied supply line.

December saw the line just south of Lake Comacchio, with the Germans holding a salient to the west. Fifth Army was in the high passes of the Apennines.|$|E

Five spirits can inhabit the skateboard, each representing one of the five elements (earth, fire, wood, water, and metal). Evidently, Ryang does not have to have the skateboard with him to access magical power, and is extremely likely he can do much more.|$|E
25|$|Edwards {{estimated}} that the cost would be £2,500, with staunches costing £50 each. Edward Everard, a merchant from King's Lynn, and Robert Crow, a gentleman from Swaffham, advanced £2,600 to fund the work, and Edwards was given the contract. It began {{at the end of}} September 1757, and he had just one year to complete it. He would not be paid until the work was completed. A year passed, and although £1,900 had been spent, the work <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>near</b> complete. The completion date was moved to 1 January 1759, and then 15 February, after which Edwards would suffer a penalty of £20 per week until the work was completed. Two extra staunches were required, which the commissioners felt should be paid for by Edwards. He appealed, and was given until 3 August to complete the work, present his accounts, and justify his appeal. The works were finished by this date, but it is unclear who paid for the two staunches.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon, who was by now present {{alongside}} Davout, reconnoitered {{the situation}} and, seeing that Archduke John's army <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>near</b> the battlefield, ordered the reserves back to Raasdorf, leaving only Arrighi's cuirassiers and {{a battery of}} 12-pounders with III Corps. The Emperor reconfirmed that he wanted Davout to take Markgrafneusiedl, but, instead of a massive frontal attack, he instructed the Marshal to launch {{a part of his}} men frontally against the position and a part in an enveloping move from the east, in order {{to take advantage of the}} gentle slope there. These new orders meant that Davout could not start his attack right away, as he needed to send a part of his troops east, where he had to bridge the Russbach stream, in order to allow his artillery to cross. Napoleon then issued orders to Oudinot and Eugène, instructing them to support Davout by pinning down the Austrian forces on the Russbach, once the IIIrd Corps began its attack.|$|E

25|$|Warwickshire {{felt the}} loss of seamer Heath Streak to injury as they went down by a massive margin to a strong Kent side at Maidstone. Batting first, Warwickshire were 116 for 8 when Tony Frost {{departed}} for 23, Simon Cook and Amjad Khan having taken three wickets each. However, a ninth-wicket partnership of 97 between Streak and Neil Carter, along with a level-headed stand from the number 11 Neil Warren lifted Warwickshire to 252. As it turned out, it <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>near</b> enough. Streak limpered off in his fifth over with a groin injury, leaving all-rounder Alex Loudon and Carter to do {{the brunt of the}} bowling, and they were woefully ineffective against Kent's batting line-up. Matthew Walker and Darren Stevens both made centuries for Kent, Martin van Jaarsveld chipped in with 62, while Loudon was Warwickshire's best bowler with three for 130, Kent amassed 569 - a lead of 317 runs. In the twenty overs remaining on the third day, Andrew Hall dug out two wickets for Kent, including England Test batsman Ian Bell for a duck. On a fourth-day pitch which turned plenty, Min Patel could take six for 53, as Warwickshire crumbled in a woeful heap for 153.|$|E
500|$|Carissa Pavlica from TV Fanatic noted, [...] "'Concentrate and Ask Again'" [...] {{did little}} to drive the {{overriding}} story forward, but it did a brilliant job of making me question everything." [...] Nonetheless, she commented that it [...] "... <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>near</b> as intense as 'Reciprocity'." [...] IGN writer Ramsey Isler did not think there was anything [...] "particularly remarkable about the core elements of this story – it's the same old formula that both Fringe and The X-Files used frequently – but the episode has a generous helping of little revealing character elements sprinkled throughout." [...] Isler praised the final ten minutes for [...] "provid some really interesting action" [...] with Olivia's ending of the case, and the revelation of Simon's note in conjunction with Sam's knowledge of the First People. He ultimately graded the episode 7.5/10.|$|E
500|$|Baldur's Gate IIs {{gameplay}} {{was called}} [...] "addicting" [...] by GamePro.

Computer Gaming World agreed, saying players would put more consideration into designing and implementing combat plans. Eurogamer noted that the interface was [...] "incredibly easy to use." [...] Some reviewers, however, felt the non-player characters in the game were not as powerful as player-made characters. GameSpy said the game is much more difficult than Baldur's Gate and requires more strategy and planning than the original does. GameSpot felt the opening level of the game [...] "falls flat," [...] but that it gets much better once the player reaches Athkatla. IGN also noted that the introductory section of the game, while good, <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>near</b> as fun as the adventures in Athkatla.|$|E

500|$|Criticism {{was also}} {{levelled}} at the delay {{of the search}} efforts. On 11 March, {{three days after the}} aircraft disappeared, British satellite company Inmarsat (or its partner, SITA) had provided officials with data suggesting the aircraft <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>near</b> the areas in the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea being searched at that time, and may have diverted its course through a southern or northern corridor. This information was publicly acknowledged and released by Najib only on 15 March in a press conference. Explaining why information about satellite signals had not been made available earlier, Malaysia Airlines said that the raw satellite signals needed to be verified and analysed [...] "so that their significance could be properly understood" [...] before it could publicly confirm their existence. Hishammuddin said that Malaysian and US investigators had immediately discussed the Inmarsat data upon receiving them on 12 March, and on two occasions, both groups agreed that it needed further processing and sent the data to the US twice for this purpose. Data analysis was completed on 14 March: by then, the AAIB had independently arrived at the same conclusion.|$|E
500|$|He {{signed for}} Crawley for an {{undisclosed}} fee on 31 August 2010, the transfer being completed three minutes before the transfer deadline. The fee was reported by The Press to be around £300,000, although Crawley co-owner Bruce Winfield dismissed this figure, saying [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>nowhere</b> <b>near</b> that". The Non-League Paper reported the fee to be £275,500; if true, this meant a new record had been set for the highest transfer fee between two non-League clubs. After signing, Brodie said [...] "What they're trying to plan here and the aims this club have got {{is to be a}} Football League club. They've got as good a chance as anybody." [...] He made his debut as a 55th-minute substitute in a 1–1 home draw with Fleetwood Town on 4 September 2010. On his first start, Brodie scored his first goal for Crawley with the second goal in a 2–0 victory away to Histon on 11 September 2010. Crawley rejected an offer for him from an unnamed League Two club in January 2011. Brodie struggled to force his way into the Crawley starting line-up on a regular basis, and finished the season with 13 goals in 45 appearances for Crawley as the club won the Conference Premier title and therefore promotion into League Two.|$|E
