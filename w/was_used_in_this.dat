Periods when Kinkladze <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> way included Frank Clark's first months as Manchester City manager, and alongside Fabrizio Ravanelli at Derby County. Though a left-footed player, he did not perform well when played as a left winger, and publicly expressed his distaste for playing in the position.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the Han dynasty, when the state needed to {{accurately}} measure distances traveled throughout the empire, the Chinese relied on a mechanical odometer. The Chinese odometer was a wheeled carriage, its gearwork being driven by {{the rotation of the}} carriage's wheels; specific units of distance—the Chinese li—were marked by the mechanical striking of a drum or bell as an auditory signal. The specifications for the 11th century odometer were written by Chief Chamberlain Lu Daolong, who is quoted extensively in the historical text of the Song Shi (compiled by 1345). In the Song period, the odometer vehicle was also combined with another old complex mechanical device known as the south-pointing chariot. This device, originally crafted by Ma Jun in the 3rd century, incorporated a differential gear that allowed a figure mounted on the vehicle to always point in the southern direction, no matter how the vehicle's wheels turned about. The concept of the differential gear that <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> navigational vehicle is now found in modern automobiles in order to apply an equal amount of torque to a car's wheels even when they are rotating at different speeds.|$|E

5|$|Framlingham Castle {{was given}} to Pembroke College as a philanthropic gesture in 1636, after which the {{internal}} buildings were taken down {{to make way for}} the construction of a poorhouse within the site. The castle <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> way until 1839 when the facility was closed; the castle was then used as a drill hall and as a county court. In 1913, Pembroke College placed Framlingham into the guardianship of the Commissioner of Works. During the Second World War, Framlingham Castle was used by the British military as part of the regional defences against a potential German invasion. Today, Framlingham Castle is managed by English Heritage and run as a tourist attraction. It is protected under UK law as a grade I listed building and a scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|Sir Thomas Lewknor was a {{supporter}} of the House of Lancaster during the Wars of the Roses, which began in 1455. When Richard of the House of York ascended to the throne as Richard III in 1483, Lewknor was accused of treason and of raising men-at-arms in southeast England. In November 1483, Lewknor's uncle and Thomas Howard, the Earl of Surrey, were given permission to levy men and besiege Bodiam Castle, where Lewknor was based. It is not recorded whether the siege went ahead, and Thackray suggests that Lewknor surrendered without much resistance. His property was confiscated, and Nicholas Rigby was made constable of the castle. On Henry VII's accession to the English throne the attainder was revoked, and Bodiam Castle was returned to Lewknor. However, not all the surrounding land was returned to the family until 1542. Possession of Bodiam Castle passed through several generations of the Lewknor family. Although the inheritance of the castle can be traced through the 16th and 17th centuries, there is little to indicate how it <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> period, or if the family spent much time in it.|$|E
5|$|The ship's {{construction}} {{period was}} very lengthy, beginning in August 1881 and completing in February 1888.

She spent her career alternating between the Active and Reserve Squadrons, where she took part in training exercises each year {{with the rest of}} the fleet. The ship was stricken from the naval register in 1909 and converted into a floating oil tank. She <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> capacity until 1943, when she was sunk by bombs during World War II. The wreck was eventually raised and scrapped in 1945.|$|E

25|$|The risk to sappers is {{far greater}} because they may {{be called upon to}} perform {{clearance}} as tactics dictate, including in all-weather conditions and on schedule. Command may accept casualties in the process. Furthermore, it is accepted that mine clearance will be imperfect and there may be casualties from undiscovered mines. One advantage is that, in military operations, sappers are dealing with recently laid mines that respond predictably to clearance, have not 'migrated', and have not degraded (unless old stock <b>was</b> <b>used).</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> they are often aided by technical intelligence on the current adversary's mines, which are usually of a single type.|$|E
25|$|Evolution, like prohibition, {{is a broad}} term. In recent bickering, however, {{evolution}} has been understood to mean the theory which holds that man has developed from some pre-existing lower type. This is the popular significance of evolution, just as the popular significance of prohibition is prohibition of the traffic in intoxicating liquors. It was in that sense that evolution <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> act. It is in this sense that the word {{will be used in}} this opinion, unless the context otherwise indicates. It is only to the theory of the evolution of man from a lower type that the act before us was intended to apply, and much of the discussion we have heard is beside this case.|$|E
25|$|A foundry facing mold wash is a {{water-based}} paint of amorphous or fine flake graphite. Painting {{the inside of}} a mold with it and letting it dry leaves a fine graphite coat that will ease separation of the object cast after the hot metal has cooled. Graphite lubricants are specialty items for use at very high or very low temperatures, as forging die lubricant, an antiseize agent, a gear lubricant for mining machinery, and to lubricate locks. Having low-grit graphite, or even better no-grit graphite (ultra high purity), is highly desirable. It {{can be used as a}} dry powder, in water or oil, or as colloidal graphite (a permanent suspension in a liquid). An estimate based on USGS graphite consumption statistics indicates that 2,200 tonnes <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> fashion in 2005.|$|E

Commando and raiding operations were undertaken by No. 11 (Scottish) Commando from Cyprus.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{principal}} reasons for concern about Ashton's {{translation of the}} title. Firstly, 'Judaism' in English carries the meaning of 'the profession or practice of the Jewish religion; the religious system or the polity of the Jews', a topic on which Wagner does not touch. 'Judentum' however in 19th-century Germany carried a much broader meaning—roughly analogous to the nonce English word 'Jewdom' (cf. Christendom) and including {{the concept of the}} social practices of the Jews. In particular it carried the pejorative sense of 'haggling' or 'marketeering'—it <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> sense for example by Karl Marx. Undoubtedly Wagner wished to refer to this sense, in effect using the word as a pun, as the commercialism implied forms the topic of the essay as a whole. It is therefore important to bear in mind the full range of implications of the title-word 'Judentum' in considering the essay as a whole. 'Jewishness', whilst not ideal, is perhaps a closer English approximation to 'Judentum' than 'Judaism'.|$|E
25|$|Sasse {{followed}} her initial {{success at the}} Théâtre Lyrique with performances as Eurydice in Gluck's Orphée. The version of the opera which <b>was</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> landmark revival was especially prepared by the composer Hector Berlioz, who also coached and rehearsed the singers, with Camille Saint-Saëns as his assistant. The opera had originally been written in Italian as Orfeo ed Euridice for Vienna in 1762, {{and the role of}} Orfeo was performed by the mezzo-soprano castrato Gaetano Guadagni. Gluck had decided to bring the opera to Paris in 1774, but castrato singers were unusual in France and sometimes objects of ridicule. Heroic lovers were generally played by high tenors, a voice type referred to in French as haute-contre, so Gluck transposed and adapted the role of Orphée for the haute-contre Joseph Legros. Unfortunately, the rise in standard pitch over the years had made the French version for haute-contre impractical, and the opera was rarely performed.|$|E
