5|$|Measure 1–30: the {{orchestra}} presents itself with <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a ritornello, but {{is in fact}} rather a concerto tutti. The movement has {{the form of an}} Italian aria, modelled after the concerto style Bach had developed in Köthen: in that style the material is presented in an instrumental tutti.|$|E
5|$|Piper Maru, a French salvage vessel, is {{exploring}} the Pacific Ocean. Gauthier, {{a member of}} the ship's crew, dives down into the sea and finds a sunken fighter plane from World War II. He is shocked to find a man alive in the plane's cockpit, with <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> black oil in his eyes. When Gauthier returns to the surface, he has become possessed by the black oil.|$|E
5|$|Agent Fox Mulder {{arrives at}} the civic center after <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a massacre; bodies lie on the {{sidewalk}} and in the foyer. Sheriff Spencer (John Cygan) explains that the suspect murdered four people from the elevator with his bare hands. His rampage ended when he was shot by a security guard. Spencer notes that seven other individuals have murdered twenty-two people in Franklin in the past six months. Mulder discovers that the LED display in the elevator has been damaged, and that the dead suspect has a green residue on his fingertips.|$|E

5|$|The bronzes of Igbo-Ukwu pay special {{attention}} to detail depicting birds, snails, chameleons, and other natural aspects of the world such as a hatching bird. Other pieces include gourds and vessels which were often given handles. The pieces are so fine that small insects were included on the surfaces of some while others have <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> bronze wires decorated around them. None of these extra details were made separately; the bronzes were all one piece. Igbo-Ukwu gave the evidence of an early bronze casting tradition in Nri.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} a metal box brought in {{containing}} the remains of Billy Miles. The coroner examines it and notices {{what appears to be}} a metal vertebra. After he leaves the room, the metal vertebra begins to spin, growing into <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> the beginnings of a metallic spine. Meanwhile, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Monica Reyes arrive at the abandoned town where Special Agent John Doggett (Robert Patrick) was born.|$|E
5|$|The {{water pipit}} has a {{complete}} moult between July and September, {{although there is}} considerable individual variation in timing. There is a partial pre-breeding moult, mainly between January and March, but with much variability in timing. This moult typically involves replacing the head, body and some wing feathers, but the extent is again variable. Very occasionally, females may moult into <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> non-breeding plumage, rather than the expected brighter garb. The chicks start to gain juvenile plumage {{as soon as a}} month after hatching, and most have completed the transition to near-adult appearance by September. The first pre-breeding moult {{is similar to that of}} the adult, but may be less complete or even absent.|$|E

5|$|Timmy {{wakes up}} in <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> his bedroom; in reality he is still inside The Darkness, {{and the world is}} merely an {{illusion}} to him. Timmy's fairy godparents and Jorgen come to rescue him, and they exit The Darkness successfully. Back on Earth, the Lead Eliminator uses Jorgen's wand to poof Timmy's friends and family away into The Darkness. Military Extraterrestrial Research Facility (M.E.R.F.) agents launch an array of military weapons at the Eliminator, but he absorbs the ordnance and turns into a more powerful version, the Destructinator. He surrounds the Earth with a steel casing, which transforms the M.E.R.F. agents into his henchmen. They plant explosives inside Earth and give the Destructinator a detonation remote.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} an empty room with a fish painting, and then shows Madonna holding to <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a baby, but is {{actually}} a big bag of water. Alternating scenes shows her in a red and black kimono dancing to the song. Then, a scene features {{a group of people}} of Asian heritage, who walk down a dark hallway. As Madonna sings the song in a black kimono, she grips onto the bag of water. When the chorus starts, it features Madonna in a red kimono continuing to dance. This scene carries on {{through the rest of the}} song. There are multiple scenes of Japanese people performing butoh dance moves coached by Swedish choreographer Su-En. These scenes were shot in a decommissioned R1 Reactor below the Royal Institute of Technology in central Stockholm. The ending scene has Madonna sitting while someone is painting her back and slowly rests her body on the group. As the song fades, Madonna is in her red kimono walking and laughing towards the camera and then the screen rapidly fades to black.|$|E

60|$|Moore stooped {{and tried}} to lift <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> an {{enormous}} plate. He was unable to raise the object, still weighed down as {{it was with the}} ghastly remnants of the dead. With feverish haste we cleared away the debris, and at last lifted and brought to light a huge and massive disk of gold, divided into rays which spread from the centre, each division being adorned with strange figures in relief--figures of animals, plants, and <b>what</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> rude hieroglyphs.|$|R

25|$|Photography {{of certain}} {{subject matter is}} {{restricted}} in the United Kingdom. In particular, the Protection of Children Act 1978 restricts making or possessing pornography of children under 18, or <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> pornography of under-18s. There is no law prohibiting photographing children in public spaces.|$|E
25|$|Froon's camera {{contained}} {{photos from}} April 1 {{suggesting that the}} women had taken a trail at the overlook of the Continental Divide and wandered into some wilderness hours before their first attempt to reach 911, but with no signs of anything unusual. On April 8, ninety flash photos were taken between 01:00 am and 04:00 am, apparently deep in the jungle and in near-complete darkness. A few photos show that they were possibly near a river or a ravine. Some show a twig with plastic bags and candy wrappers {{on top of a}} rock, another shows <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> toilet paper and a mirror on another rock, and another shows the back of Kremers's head with <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> blood by her temple.|$|E

25|$|Politically, {{there is}} {{evidence}} of several Sassanid and Chinese efforts in forging alliances against the common enemy, the Hephthalites. Upon the rise of the nomadic Göktürks in Inner Asia, there is also <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a collaboration between China and Sassanid to defuse Turkic advances. Documents from Mt. Mogh talk about the presence of a Chinese general {{in the service of the}} king of Sogdiana at the time of the Arab invasions.|$|E
25|$|Kurzweil says {{evolutionary}} progress looks smooth, {{but that}} really it {{is divided into}} paradigms, specific methods of solving problems. Each paradigm starts with slow growth, builds to rapid growth, and then levels off. As one paradigm levels off, pressure builds to find or develop a new paradigm. So <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a single smooth curve is really series of smaller S curves. For example Kurzweil notes that when vacuum tubes stopped getting faster, cheaper transistors became popular and continued the overall exponential growth.|$|E
25|$|Robbins insists they {{explore the}} {{structure}} separately {{and the two}} part ways, keeping in contact with their communicators. In {{what appears to be}} a museum, Low discovers a pair of crystals containing a glowing green liquid. After seeing a demonstration in the museum of similar crystals being used in <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a resurrection ceremony, Low tries one on Brink, bringing him back to life. They then search for a means to return to Earth, using Brink's and Robbins' talents for xenoarchaeology to decipher strange alien text and images.|$|E

25|$|Irish tales {{depict the}} Dagda {{as a figure}} of power, armed with a club. In Dorset there is a famous outline of an ithyphallic giant known as the Cerne Abbas Giant with a club cut into the chalky soil. While this was {{probably}} produced in relatively modern times (English Civil War era), it was long {{thought to be a}} representation of the Dagda. This has been called into question by recent studies which show {{that there may have been}} a representation of <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a large drapery hanging from the horizontal arm of the figure, leading to suspicion that this figure actually represents Hercules (Heracles), with the skin of the Nemean lion over his arm and carrying the club he used to kill it. In Gaul, it is speculated that the Dagda is associated with Sucellus, the striker, equipped with a hammer and cup.|$|E
25|$|User-generated {{content is}} a major feature of Spore; there are {{eighteen}} different editors (some unique to a phase). All have the same general UI and controls for positioning, scaling and coloring parts, whether {{for the creation of}} a creature, or for a building or vehicle. The Creature editor, for example, allows the player to take <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a lump of clay with a spine and mold it into a creature. Once the torso is shaped, the player can add parts such as legs, arms, feet, hands, noses, eyes, and mouths. Many of these parts affect the creature's abilities (speed, strength, diet, etc.), while some parts are purely decorative. Once the creature is formed, it can be painted using a large number of textures, overlays, colors, and patterns, which are procedurally applied depending on the topology of the creature. The only required feature is the mouth. All other parts are optional; for example, creatures without legs will slither on the ground like a slug or an inchworm, and creatures without arms will be unable to pick up objects.|$|E
25|$|Season 6 {{begins with}} Chuck and Blair who part ways {{after making a}} pact that they will unite once they both achieve their {{individual}} goals. Chuck goes {{on his way to}} try to regain Bass Industries from his father who stole it from him while Blair tries to find herself and her individuality by taking over her mother’s company at her mother's request. Serena pursues a relationship with someone older and who happens to have a 17-year-old daughter, Sage who will do anything to try to split them up. Nate focuses on trying to get the Spectator to become successful and dates Sage. Meanwhile, Dan focuses on completing his second book with Georgina’s help. In the end after a surprising turn of events Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester) and Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) get married. In the final moments the series speeds forward five years later where Chuck and Blair are revealed to have had a child and Nate Archibald appears successful and is rumored to be running for Mayor of New York. The show ends with the wedding of Serena van der Woodsen and Dan Humphrey. It's a small ceremony, in <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> Blair and Chuck's home together, where Lily is with Serena and Eric's father, William, and Rufus seems to be happy with another woman (musician Lisa Loeb, who guest-starred in the first season) along with Dorota, Nate, Jack Bass and Georgina (who are now together), Jenny and Eric. A brief shot of The Spectator reveals that Lola Rhodes and Olivia Burke are now starring in a film about Ivy Dickens, based on her best-selling autobiography.|$|E
