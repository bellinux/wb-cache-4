5|$|As {{the players}} took {{the field for}} the second half, D.C. coach Tom Soehn decided to replace Fred, who had been a non-factor in the first half, with Santino Quaranta. In the 60th minute, Gomez, Pontius and Luciano Emilio {{combined}} inside Seattle's 18-yard box for a United opportunity, but Pontius mishit the shot, which resulted in an easy save for Seattle's goalkeeper, Kasey Keller. Seven minutes later, another failed D.C. United opportunity resulted in a Sounders FC counterattack, where Freddie Ljungberg's shot was saved by <b>Wicks.</b> The rebound rolled in front of Fredy Montero, who dove feet first and kicked the ball into the goal, giving Sounders FC a 1–0 lead. Following the goal, frustrated D.C. United goalkeeper Josh <b>Wicks</b> stomped on Montero's leg while he was still on the ground. After consulting with the fourth official, referee Alex Prus showed <b>Wicks</b> a red card for his behavior, dismissing him from the match. United's backup goalkeeper, Milos Kocic, was substituted for Christian Gomez after the incident, and D.C. played with 10 men {{for the remainder of the}} match.|$|E
5|$|Five {{minutes into}} the match, D.C. United first-year player Chris Pontius had the first chance of the evening as he pushed past Sounders FC defender Leonardo González to receive a {{diagonal}} pass from Clyde Simms. However, due to the difficult shooting angle, Pontius' shot was wide of the far post. In the 10th minute, Sounders FC forward Fredy Montero had a close range shot on goal, but D.C. goalkeeper Josh <b>Wicks</b> parried the shot away. Seven minutes later, Christian Gomez had a goal scoring opportunity with a direct free kick from , but his low kick curled just wide of the target. In the 18th minute, Seattle midfielder Sebastian Le Toux played a ball in to teammate Freddie Ljungberg, whose shot on goal was barely saved by <b>Wicks,</b> who kicked out a foot to block the shot. Just before halftime, Le Toux crossed to an unmarked Montero, whose direct header on goal was just in reach of <b>Wicks,</b> who again made the save to keep the score level, 0–0. Seattle outshot D.C. 9–6 in the first half.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wick</b> {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in 1249 and is called 'the Weke' in 1542. In 1736-7 the settlement consisted of Upper <b>Wick</b> and <b>Wick.</b> In 1759 the Upper <b>Wick</b> no longer existed. In 1773 <b>Wick</b> was renamed Devizes <b>Wick,</b> the prefix being doubtless added to {{distinguish it from}} Potterne <b>Wick</b> and <b>Wick</b> in Rowde. In 1795-6 the hamlet contained between 30 and 33 assessable houses. <b>Wick</b> was later known for it dairy industry, non of which exists today.|$|R

5|$|The {{world of}} comic strips saw {{a number of}} works pop up. Ben <b>Wicks</b> was doing The Outsiders and <b>Wicks,</b> Jim Unger's Herman debuted in 1975, and Ted Martin's Pavlov in 1979. In 1978, Lynn Johnston, living in Lynn Lake, Manitoba, began For Better or For Worse, which was noted for {{following}} {{the lives of the}} Patterson family as they grew older in real time, and dealt with real-life issues. The strip based a number of its storylines on Johnston's real-life experiences with her own family, as well as social issues such as the midlife crisis, divorce, the coming out of a gay character, child abuse, and death. In 1985, she became the first female cartoonist to win a Reuben Award, and the Friends of Lulu added her to the Women Cartoonists Hall of Fame in 2002. The strip was very popular, appearing in over 2000 newspapers in 25 countries.|$|E
50|$|Gian Carlo <b>Wick</b> (October 15, 1909 - April 20, 1992) was an Italian {{theoretical}} physicist {{who made}} important contributions to quantum field theory. The <b>Wick</b> rotation, <b>Wick</b> contraction, <b>Wick's</b> theorem, and the <b>Wick</b> product are named after him.|$|R

50|$|The {{lamp burner}} has a flat <b>wick,</b> usually made of cotton. The {{lower part of}} the <b>wick</b> dips into the fount and absorbs the kerosene; the top part of the <b>wick</b> extends out of the <b>wick</b> tube of the lamp burner, which {{includes}} a wick-adjustment mechanism. Adjusting how much of the <b>wick</b> extends above the <b>wick</b> tube controls the flame. The <b>wick</b> tube surrounds the <b>wick,</b> and ensures that the correct amount of air reaches the lamp burner. Adjustment is usually done by means of a small knob operating a cric, which is a toothed, metal sprocket bearing against the <b>wick.</b> If the <b>wick</b> is too high, and extends beyond the burner cone {{at the top of the}} <b>wick</b> tube, the lamp will produce smoke and soot (unburned carbon). When the lamp is lit, the kerosene that the <b>wick</b> has absorbed burns and produces a clear, bright, yellow flame. As the kerosene burns, capillary action in the <b>wick</b> draws more kerosene up from the fuel tank. All kerosene flat <b>wick</b> lamps use the dead flame burner design, where the flame is fed cold air from below and hot air exits above.|$|R

After {{averaging}} 16.8points, 4.4rebounds and 4.0assists {{per game}} during the 2006–07 NBA season, Roy was named NBA Rookie of the Year. He received 127 out of 128 first-place votes. Due to injury, {{he played in}} only 57games in that season, the second-fewest games for a Rookie of the Year. He was the third Trail Blazer to win the award, the first two being Geoff Petrie and Sidney <b>Wicks.</b>|$|E
5|$|The flowers provide dyes {{of bright}} yellow or green, {{and have been}} used for hair dye. The dried leaves and hair were made into candle <b>wicks,</b> or put into shoes to help with {{insulating}} them. The dried stems were also dipped into suet or wax to make torches. Due to its weedy capacities, the plant, unlike other species of the genus (such as V.phoeniceum), is not often cultivated.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} Cleveland Cavaliers and Buffalo Braves (now Los Angeles Clippers), the Trail Blazers entered the NBA in 1970 as an {{expansion}} team, under coach Rolland Todd. Geoff Petrie and Sidney <b>Wicks</b> {{led the team}} in its early years, and the team failed {{to qualify for the}} playoffs in its first six seasons of existence. During that span, the team had three head coaches (including future hall-of-famer Lenny Wilkens); team executive Stu Inman also served as coach. The team won the first pick in the NBA draft twice during that span. In 1972, the team drafted LaRue Martin with the number one pick, and in 1974 the team selected Bill Walton from UCLA.|$|E

5|$|In 1894, the {{lighthouse}} was further altered {{to increase the}} amount of light emitted. The four-wick burner and mirrors were exchanged for a Douglass burner with eight <b>wicks</b> and an improved lantern; the power of the light was increased to 35,000 candela. The characteristic of the light changed from fixed to occulting. A foghorn was also installed, with two quick blasts every five minutes. The eight-wick burner was exchanged for a three incandescent mantle burner in 1905. In 1923, the burner was replaced by a Hood petroleum vapour burner with one mantle.|$|E

5|$|State Route 149 (SR 149) {{is a short}} {{state highway}} that helps to connect Oroville and Chico through rural Butte County. Connecting State Route 70 at <b>Wicks</b> Corner with State Route 99 east of Durham, it forms part of the primary northsouth highway through the eastern Sacramento Valley, a Focus Route of the Interregional Road System. SR 149 was {{formerly}} part of the Oroville-Chico Highway; {{the majority of the}} latter was merged into other routes. In the mid-1970s, the highway was reallocated onto a newer two-lane alignment. A project to widen the two-lane road to a four-lane expressway was completed in late 2008, removing the bottleneck from the Oroville-Chico highway.|$|E

5|$|State Route 149 {{begins at}} <b>Wicks</b> Corner as a divided highway, at an {{interchange}} with SR 70 several {{miles north of}} Oroville. This is {{the north end of}} the State Route 70 freeway, which passes through a gap between the Campbell Hills and South Table Mountain on its way from Oroville. SR 149 heads northwest across gently rolling terrain before descending into the valley of the Dry Creek. As it begins to climb out of the valley, SR 149 ends at an interchange with SR 99. The latter highway continues the corridor northwest to Chico, quickly dropping back into the Butte Creek valley. The route is a divided highway with four lanes.|$|E
5|$|Drosera anglica {{grows in}} open, non-forested habitat with wet, often calcium-rich soils. These include bogs, marl fens, quaking bogs, cobble shores, and other {{calcareous}} habitats. This tolerance of calcium is relatively {{rare in the}} rest of the genus. D. anglica is often associated with various sphagnum mosses, and many times grows in a soil substrate that is entirely composed of living, dead, or decomposed sphagnum. The sphagnum <b>wicks</b> moisture to the surface while simultaneously acidifying it. What soil nutrients are not seeped away by the constant moisture are often used up by the sphagnum or made unavailable by the low soil pH. Since nutrient availability is low, competition from other plants is diminished, allowing the carnivorous English sundew to flourish.|$|E

5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium {{seeds and}} stems are edible {{and are used}} in {{traditional}} Native American cuisine by Alaska Natives, Inuit and Inupiat people. The leaves and roots of E.angustifolium are also edible and, because of their astringent properties, used by the Yupik peoples for medicinal purposes, {{through a process of}} decoction, infusion or poultice, to treat aliments of the human gastrointestinal tract, and in the Old World for the treatment of diarrhoea. In abundance, E.angustifolium can grow with enough density to disguise wetland and bog. Consequently, it may be used as a natural indicator of areas which are hazardous and to avoid travelling through. Attempts to make a cotton-like thread from the hairs of the plant's seed-heads have been thwarted by its brittleness, but it has been used in the production of paper and candle <b>wicks</b> in Germany, and was used as a feather substitute in pillow stuffing in Sweden and Sussex, England. In Scotland, during World War I, it was used to dress wounds.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{about three-quarters}} of the Oroville-Chico Highway was absorbed by other routes. A new two-lane {{alignment}} of U.S. Route 99E (Legislative Route 3, now SR 99) between east of Richvale and Chico opened in the mid-1950s, using part of the Oroville-Chico Highway south of Durham Dayton Highway and bypassing the remainder to the junction south of Chico. In the early 1960s, U.S. Route 40 Alternate (Legislative Route 21, now SR 70) was relocated due to the damming of Lake Oroville across its old alignment. The bridge over the West Branch Feather River northwest of the dam opened in August 1962, resulting in US 40 Alt. using the Oroville-Chico Highway (which was relocated to a new four-lane freeway alignment) south of <b>Wicks</b> Corner. The remainder, which was never part of a sign route, became Route 149 in the 1964 renumbering.|$|E

Lead-based coloring agents {{are used in}} ceramic glazes and glass, especially for red and yellow shades. Lead tetraacetate and lead dioxide are used as oxidizing agents in organic chemistry. Lead is frequently used in the polyvinyl chloride coating of electrical cords. It {{can be used to}} treat candle <b>wicks</b> to ensure a longer, more even burn. Because of its toxicity, European and North American manufacturers use alternatives such as zinc. Lead glass is composed of 12–28% lead oxide, changing its optical characteristics and reducing the transmission of ionizing radiation.
