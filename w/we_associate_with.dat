The mechanism of action involves random, detrimental germline mutations of a kind that happen to show their effect only late in life. Unlike most detrimental mutations, these would not be efficiently weeded out by natural selection.

Critic Roger Ebert noted, {{in a positive}} review, the irrelevance of the plot and [...] "moments of silliness", such as Bond finding himself driving a moon buggy with antennae revolving and robot arms flapping. He praised the Las Vegas car chase scene, particularly the segment when Bond drives the Mustang on two wheels. Twenty-five years after its release, James Berardinelli criticised {{the concept of a}} laser-shooting satellite and the performances of Jill St. John, Norman Burton and Jimmy Dean. Christopher Null called St. John [...] "one of the least effective Bond girls – beautiful, but shrill and helpless". Steve Rhodes said, [...] "looking and acting like a couple of pseudo-country bumpkins, they (Putter Smith and Bruce Glover) seem to have wandered by accident from the adjoining sound stage into the filming of this movie." [...] But he also extolled the car chase as [...] "classic". According to Danny Peary, Diamonds are Forever is [...] "one of the most forgettable movies of the entire Bond series" [...] and that [...] "until Blofeld's reappearance we must watch what is no better than a mundane diamond-smuggling melodrama, without the spectacle <b>we</b> <b>associate</b> <b>with</b> James Bond: the Las Vegas setting isn't exotic enough, there's little humour, assassins Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint are similar to characters you'd find on The Avengers, but not nearly as amusing – and the trouble Bond gets into, even Maxwell Smart could escape." [...] IGN chose it as the third worst James Bond film, behind only The Man with the Golden Gun and Die Another Day. Total Film listed Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, and Bambi and Thumper, as the first and second worst villains in the Bond series (respectively).
