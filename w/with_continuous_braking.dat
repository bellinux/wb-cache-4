50|$|It was {{claimed that}} the entire {{procedure}} could be performed in less than eight minutes.

50|$|By {{the end of}} 1900 {{the company}} had 210 engines fitted <b>with</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>brake</b> equipment, and 97% of {{passenger}} mileage was under such conditions. 2,021,266 train miles were run with the automatic vacuum brake, and 69,160 with Westinghouse.|$|R
50|$|The {{report also}} noted that the {{accident}} would have been considerably worse had the Mail not been fitted <b>with</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>brakes,</b> and noted that it might have stopped short of the buffers had the rails not been greasy.|$|R
50|$|In British practice, only {{passenger}} trains were fitted <b>with</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>brakes</b> until about 1930; goods and mineral trains ran at slower speed and {{relied on the}} brake force from the locomotive and tender and the brake van - a heavy vehicle provided {{at the rear of}} the train and occupied by a guard.|$|R
50|$|In the era before trains were {{provided}} <b>with</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>brakes,</b> whether air brakes or vacuum brakes, steep gradients were a serious problem, {{and it was}} difficult to stop safely if the line was on a steep grade. In an extreme example, the Inspector insisted that Rudgwick railway station in West Sussex be regraded before he would allow it to open. This required the gradient through the platform to be eased from 1 in 80 to 1 in 130.|$|R
5000|$|The {{requirement}} to send [...] "Train Out Of Section" [...] is that train {{has passed the}} clearing point complete with tail lamp attached. The tail lamp is a physical indication that the train was complete — that is, {{that it has not}} become divided in the section, leaving a portion behind (although in reality, almost all modern trains are fully fitted <b>with</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>brakes,</b> and hence both portions of a divided train would come to a stand if separated).|$|R

25|$|A similar {{railroad}} car design, {{the brake}} van, was used on British and Commonwealth railways. These provided the additional function of {{serving as a}} supplemental braking system for trains not fitted <b>with</b> a <b>continuous</b> <b>braking</b> system, and keeping chain couplings taut.|$|R
5000|$|Goods {{and mineral}} {{vehicles}} {{were provided with}} hand brakes by which the brakes could be applied by a hand lever operated by staff on the ground. These hand brakes were used where necessary when vehicles were parked but also when these trains needed to descend a steep gradient; the train then stopped before descending and the guard walked forward to pin down the handles of sufficient brakes to give adequate braking effort. Early goods vehicles had brake handles on one side only and random alignment of the vehicles gave the guard sufficient braking but, from about 1930, so-called [...] "either-side" [...] brake handles were provided. These trains, not fitted <b>with</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>brakes</b> were described as [...] "unfitted" [...] trains and they survived in British practice until about 1985. However, from about 1930, semi-fitted trains were introduced, in which some goods vehicles were fitted <b>with</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>brakes</b> and a proportion of such vehicles marshalled next to the locomotive gave sufficient brake power to run at somewhat higher speeds than unfitted trains. A trial in January 1952 saw a 52-wagon, 850 ton, coal train run 127 mi {{at an average of}} 38 mph, compared to the usual coal train speed on the Midland main line of 15 mph, or 20 mph to 25 mph of [...] "fitted" [...] freights. By 1952 only 14% of open wagons, 55% of covered and 80% of cattle trucks had vacuum brakes.|$|R
5|$|One major anomaly {{remained}} in the railway's operations: the 1889 Regulation of Railways Act had required, amongst other measures, that all British passenger trains be fitted <b>with</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>brakes.</b> McConnel had secured an exemption for the Talyllyn Railway, {{on the basis that}} the low speed of operation meant they were unnecessary and that the cost of compliance would bankrupt the enterprise, {{but by the end of}} the 1990s the Railway Inspectorate was insisting that the Talyllyn be brought into compliance with the act, a little over 100years after it had passed. By 2001, the railway had fitted its entire passenger fleet with the necessary equipment, operated by air brake pumps mounted on the locomotives.|$|R
5000|$|Historically {{the open}} wagon {{was the most}} common type of vehicle used for general {{merchandise}} traffic in Britain, with covered wagons ('goods vans') being used for specific types of goods requiring greater protection. Most wagons were 'unfitted' (i.e. not equipped <b>with</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>brakes),</b> the exceptions being wagons used on express goods traffic. However, British Railways' fleet modernisation during the 1950s resulted in vans being used for a much higher proportion of merchandise traffic, and the fitting of vacuum brakes as standard. The typical British goods van of this period had a 10-foot wheelbase and a payload of 12 tons. The most common types were general purpose 'ventilated vans' such as Vanfits, but there were numerous more specialised types: ...|$|R
50|$|In 1886, the Board of Trade was {{critical}} of the P&TR practice of running mixed trains with passenger carriages behind the goods wagons. In addition, there was increasing pressure to equip trains <b>with</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>brakes,</b> to install interlocking of signals and the block system of signalling; all of these initiatives required considerable expenditure and the P&TR {{did not have the}} money. The financial situation revived consideration of amalgamation, and the LNWR was considered as a partner, but this led to nothing. In fact the GWR became the partner and a lease of the P&TR to the GWR was agreed, to take effect on 1 July 1896. The GWR absorbed the Company on 1 July 1897, authorised under the GWR (Additional Powers) Act of 6 August 1897.|$|R
50|$|For a goods (freight) {{train in}} a similar situation, the wheels would have been 'scotched' against roll-back, and guard's vans on goods trains carried 'sprags' with which to do this. Those on {{passenger}} trains <b>with</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>brakes</b> {{were not required to}} carry sprags, and the excursion train did not. The guard in the rear van having applied his handbrake then (on the instructions of the chief clerk) dismounted and scotched the wheels of his van with pieces of ballast. He then also scotched the near rearmost vehicle on its righthand wheels and intended to similarly scotch its lefthand wheels before going back down the track with flags and detonators to protect the train from the scheduled service which was to set off from Armagh 20 minutes after the excursion.|$|R
50|$|Although {{this was}} not one of the {{recommendations}} of the Board of Trade report, it became the practice for steep inclines to be fitted with runaway catchpoints so that runaway vehicles would be derailed and stopped before they had a chance to collide with following trains. These catchpoints became widespread, and only diminished in numbers when all rolling stock was fitted <b>with</b> <b>continuous</b> automatic <b>brakes</b> in the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, in the 1930s the {{engineering}} company Armstrong Whitworth had {{been experimenting with}} diesel traction, {{and as part of}} their development work they built a small four-wheeled 75 hp diesel shunting locomotive. In November 1933 this was allocated to the North Sunderland line. It was not possible to fit air brakes on the small locomotive, but the passenger trains on the branch were not fitted <b>with</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>brakes</b> anyway. The locomotive was purchased on hire purchase for £1,850.Management of the line was taken over by the LNER in 1939. Trains took 20mins. on the branch, with 6 trains a day before closure. It was initially operated by Manning Wardle 0-6-0 Bamburgh, which was scrapped about 1948. 'Bamburgh' was replaced by an 0-4-0 diesel electric locomotive, 'Lady Armstrong', delivered in 1934. They were replaced until closure by NER Class H (LNER Class Y7) and passenger trains had two Great Eastern Railway 6-wheel coaches.|$|R
50|$|The first railways, {{such as the}} {{pioneering}} Liverpool and Manchester Railway of 1830, used {{a version of the}} tramways buffer and chain coupling, termed a screw-coupling. Vehicles are coupled by hand using a hook and links with a turnbuckle-like device that draws the vehicles together. Vehicles have buffers, one at each corner on the ends, which are pulled together and compressed by the coupling device. <b>With</b> no <b>continuous</b> <b>brake</b> across the entire train, the whole train was reliant on the braking capacity of the locomotive, and train lengths were restricted.|$|R
50|$|The Decauville points {{had fallen}} from a wagon on the 9.45pm 'Class D' (express goods, {{partially}} fitted <b>with</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>brake)</b> train from Heaton, which had passed through the station moments earlier. The wagon had originated at Gildersome West, near Leeds, and its oversized load of narrow gauge track for an industrial railway had not been adequately secured. The guard of the goods train had noticed sparks as the train passed under the road bridge west of Aberlady Junction, and realised that the load had come loose. He attempted to attract his driver's attention by applying and releasing the handbrake in his van, {{but this was not}} noticed. He therefore displayed a red light to the signalman at Longniddry box as he passed. The signalman immediately threw his Up line signals to danger and sent the 'stop and examine' bell code to Prestonpans signal box. The overhanging points struck the locomotive water column at the west end of the Down platform and rebounded, falling off the wagon onto the Up Main line. Meanwhile, the parcels train had already passed the Longniddry Up Distant signal at 'clear', so its crew received no warning of the danger ahead.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis {{is to develop a}} method for controlled braking of a vehicle. The brake pedal depression has been considered to be proportional to the intended deceleration. The brake controller is not aimed to replace a cruise control; it will have an anti-lock braking (ABS) function. The brake control is essentially designed to be a <b>continuous</b> control law <b>with</b> a <b>continuous</b> <b>brake</b> torque output suitable for using it on real world actuators. To develop the continuous control and taking into account the friction and elastic properties of the tyre, a quarter-car model with LuGre tyre has been derived. Considering only a quarter car keeps the model compact and by having 4 brake controllers each wheel can be controlled individually [...] .

5000|$|The express trains {{were made}} up of non-bogie non-corridor four- or six-wheel carriages. There were 13 on the Leeds express, giving a weight (including the engine and tender) of {{somewhat}} over 200 tons. At this period, other railways often {{had to resort to}} using more than one engine to maintain a high top speed,; the Great Northern (favoured with one of the best engine classes of the period - the Stirling 8-foot singles) prided itself on not doing so. As with all the other railways, though, it had considerable difficulties in stopping the trains rapidly once they were at speed. To stop a train, the driver could shut off steam, get his fireman to apply a handbrake [...] on the tender and put the engine into reverse. He had no means of applying brakes {{to the rest of the}} train; indeed most of the carriages had no brakes. Two or three of the carriages were brake carriages with handbrakes, each with a guard who would apply them when (and if) he heard the driver [...] "whistle for brakes". In trials carried out after the accident under favourable conditions this was shown to bring the train to rest within 800-1150 yards when travelling at 40-45 mph. The Railway Inspectors considered that much shorter stopping distances would be possible if passenger trains were provided <b>with</b> <b>continuous</b> <b>brakes</b> operable by the driver, and had urged such systems be fitted. This had been resisted by the railway companies as unnecessary, unreliable, expensive and dangerous.|$|R
50|$|The solar {{electric}} propulsion {{will be used}} for the cruise phase. The ion drives have very high specific impulse and very low thrust. This leads to a flight profile <b>with</b> long <b>continuous</b> low-thrust <b>braking</b> to gradually reduce the velocity of the spacecraft. Moments before Mercury orbit insertion, the MTM will be jettisoned from the spacecraft stack. After separation from the MTM, the MPO will provide the MMO all necessary power and data resources until MMO is delivered to its mission orbit; separation of MMO from MPO will be accomplished by spin-ejection.|$|R
50|$|The {{automatic}} {{vacuum brake}} had been developed: {{it was designed}} to apply fully if the train becomes divided or if a hose becomes displaced, but opposition on the grounds of cost (particularly by the LNWR and its chairman Richard Moon) to the fitting of the automatic type of brake meant that it took a serious accident at Armagh in 1889 before legislation compelled the automatic system. In this accident at Armagh, a portion of a train was detached from the locomotive on a steep gradient and ran away, killing 80 people. The train was fitted with the simple vacuum brake, which was useless on the disconnected portion of the train. It was clear that if the vehicles had been fitted <b>with</b> an automatic <b>continuous</b> <b>brake,</b> the accident would almost certainly not have happened, and the public concern at the scale of the accident prompted legislation mandating the use of a <b>continuous</b> automatic <b>brake</b> on all passenger trains.|$|R
50|$|The key {{recommendation}} {{was in fact}} couched as a finding:This terrible calamity {{would in}} all human probability have been prevented had the excursion train been fitted <b>with</b> an automatic <b>continuous</b> <b>brake</b> instead of (as it was) with only a non-automatic <b>continuous</b> <b>brake.</b> In the former case, on the dividing of the train taking place, the brake would have remained on, or (had it been previously taken off) {{would have been at}} once applied to, the rear vehicles, and these would have remained immovable, notwithstanding any possible bump they might have received {{from the front of the}} train, when the driver was setting back to make a start.It may also be remarked that the ordinary train had a narrow escape from serious collision between the portions into which it was divided, or with buffer stops; whereas had it been supplied with an automatic brake, there would have been no risk of such collisions.As the President of the Board of Trade has stated in Parliament his intention tointroduce a Bill to make compulsory the adoption of automatic continuous brakes,should the report on this collision point out that it would have been avoided had the excursion train been fitted with them, it is unnecessary for me to say more upon the subject.|$|R
50|$|The Great Northern Railway (Ireland) reached Victoria Bridge in 1852. Plans for {{a narrow}} gauge rail link to Castlederg were agreed {{at a public}} meeting held in the town in August 1881. The line was {{constructed}} shortly prior to {{the enactment of the}} Tramways Act 1883, and opened in April 1883, so the promoters lost out on any financial assistance from the government. Because of a sharp gradient on the approach to Victoria Bridge, all trains had to be equipped <b>with</b> a Westinghouse <b>continuous</b> <b>braking</b> system - the first trains in Ireland to be so equipped. The line's first two steam locomotives were fitted with enclosed bodywork as tram engines. Throughout its operation, the line was normally served by three return workings every day (except Sundays), with an additional service on Fridays and Castlederg Fair days. It started with two Kitson tramway type 0-4-0T locomotives, but these were both gone by 1912. A third improved Kitson tram locomotive was acquired in 1891, this was withdrawn in 1928.|$|R

5000|$|As train loads, {{gradients}} and speeds increased, braking {{became a}} problem. In the late 19th century, significantly better <b>continuous</b> <b>brakes</b> started to appear.

40|$|In this study, two {{different}} ventilated brake discs were manufactured and their braking force performances and heat generations were investigated experimentally {{together with a}} solid disc. Braking force outputs were examined in sudden and <b>continuous</b> <b>braking</b> conditions and disc temperatures were simply measured in <b>continuous</b> <b>braking</b> conditions. Fourteen pedal forces were used in sudden braking tests and eight periodic measurements were executed in <b>continuous</b> <b>braking</b> tests. Experiment results showed that ventilation applications not only increased the brake force outputs up to 42. 6 %, but also reduced the heat formation on discs up to 31. 5 % depending on test conditions...|$|R

2500|$|The SR Z {{class was}} {{considered}} at first, {{but due to}} the specialist characteristics of the design as a yard engine for marshalling freight, they were not deemed fit {{for the purpose of}} hauling loads under the tight timings of London's railway system. The solution was a smaller wheeled version of the ill-fated K1 class with three cylinders to allow for better acceleration, with three sets Walschaerts valve gear. The resultant W class, was designed in 1929. As a result of the rebuilding of the 'River' K1 class 2-6-4 tank engines following the Sevenoaks railway accident, the surplus bogies and leading wheels were earmarked for the new design. The 2-6-4 wheel arrangement was settled upon as being ideal for intensive suburban routes, and the use of parts from the K Class and the same boiler as used on the N, N1 and U1 classes enabled the standardization of Southern locomotives to continue. The locomotives were provided with [...] heavy braking equipment to cater for freight wagons <b>with</b> or without <b>continuous</b> <b>brakes</b> that were in circulation at the time. With this in mind, the class were unusually provided with extra braking on the bogies and trailing wheels.|$|R
