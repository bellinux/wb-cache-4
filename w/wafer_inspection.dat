40|$|International audienceOver {{the past}} decade, control of process tools has {{progressively}} moved from bare non-product <b>wafers</b> <b>inspection</b> toward on-product measurements. Nevertheless, in high-mix facilities, recipe creation {{for all products}} is not possible. Most of the semiconductor fabs use today "high runners" lots that are flagged for defectivity. Due to non-linearity and variability of the line [1], lots may be stopped, overtake each-other or ignore certain tools. This is the drawback of this sampling method: {{the efficiency of the}} defectivity measurement with respect to information is often under optimal. On an other hand, the measurement equipments are very expensive and fabs are limited in capacity of inspection. Using the sampling method already quoted, we take the risk of controlling some lots unnecessarily. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate this risk and to propose a solution to optimize the use of control equipment. The case study described here takes place in STMicroelectronics 300 mm wafer fab in Crolles, France. It considers the global fab toolset and studies the skip, under some assumptions, of a defectivity measurement. The Wafer-At-Risk is in use as the risk evaluation of each tool. The information brought by each lot that can be inspected is called the Wafer-At-Risk-Reduction. The problem is that this data is not directly available in fab, so, an algorithm was developed for the computation of the Wafer-At-Risk and Wafer-At-Risk-Reduction...|$|R

This paper discusses the new optical nano-defects detection method, which is applicable to the silicon <b>wafer</b> surface <b>inspection</b> technique for next-generation semiconductors. In our proposed method, the evanescent light is emerged on the wafer surface with total internal reflection (TIR) of infrared (IR) laser at the Si-air interface. And by scanning the surface where is evanescent light emerging with very shaped fibre probe, it enables to detect nanometre scale defects {{in the vicinity of}} Si wafer surface without diffraction limit to resolution. To verify the feasibility of this method, both of the computer simulations based on Maxwell’s equations and the several fundamental experiments are performed.

Equipping massive numbers of mobile phones with built-in dig-ital cameras has scaled up demand for miniature lenses resid-ing on wafers. A new ultrafast, automated wavefront analyzer can reliably test such microlens wafers, {{at a rate of}} several sec-onds per lens, assuring quality control for this disruptive tech-nology in micro-optics manufacturing. Assessment of lens imag-ing quality is ordinarily carried out by computing the modula-tion transfer function (MTF). 1 However, this method offers only limited information when testing individual lenses. More detail can be obtained from wavefront measurements that provide a spatially resolved map of the refraction properties of the lens, which can be readily compared with design data. To implement such rapid in-line testing, we employ wave-front sensing technology that makes use of a Shack–Hartmann (SH) -based measurement system. The high dynamic range (> 1000 λ) of the sensor enables measurement and analysis of spherical and aspherical optics over the entire aperture. For test equipment in a wafer-level production environment, we use fully automated lens-positioning procedures, including lateral positioning, autofocus, and error compensation. In our configuration, we employ the WaveMaster PRO Wafer instrument in a reverse projection setup that uses a high-resolution SH sensor. 2 The sample lens is illuminated by a point light source, and the pupil is imaged on the sensor by a telescope system that, in addition, magnifies the wavefront for maximum use of the sensor area and dynamic range (see Figure 1).

While the tool works very well for general <b>wafer</b> <b>inspection,</b> it has unusual capabilities for high aspect ratio inspection (HARI) and for detecting thin residual film defects (partial height defects). Inspection of HAR structures is rated as one of the highest unmet priorities of the member companies of International SEMATECH, and finding residual thin film defects (in some cases called “stringers”) is also a very difficult challenge. The capabilities that make DDH unusually sensitive include: 1) the capture of the whole wave [...] both the classical amplitude captured by traditional optical systems, and the phase of the wave, with phase potentially measured to ~ 1 / 1000 ’th of a wavelength or ~ 2 to 3 Angstroms for a deep ultra-violet (DUV) laser; 2) heterodyne detection—this allows it to capture very low signal levels; and 3) a head-on geometry using a collimated laser beam that allows best penetration of HAR structures.

This manuscript focuses on additional results since the former conference. First experimental evidence is given {{that a second}} generation blank inspection tool has missed a number of printing reticle defects caused by an imperfection of its EUV mirror, i. e., so-called multi-layer defects (ML-defects). This work continued to {{use a combination of}} blank inspection (BI), patterned mask inspection (PMI) and <b>wafer</b> <b>inspection</b> (WI) to find as many as possible printing defects on EUV reticles. The application of more advanced <b>wafer</b> <b>inspection,</b> combined with a separate repeater analysis for each of the multiple focus conditions used for exposure on the ASML Alpha Demo Tool (ADT) at IMEC, has allowed to increase the detection capability for printing ML-defects. It exploits the previous finding that ML-defects may have a through-focus printing behavior. They cause a different grade of CD impact on the pattern in their neighborhood, depending on the focus condition. Subsequent reticle review is done on the corresponding locations with both SEM (Secondary Electron Microscope) and AFM (Atomic Force Microscope). This review methodology has allowed achieving clear evidence of printing ML defects missed by this BI tool, despite of a too high nuisance rate, reported before.

40|$|The quality {{assessment}} of multi-crystalline and high-performance multi-crystalline silicon <b>wafers</b> during incoming <b>inspection</b> of solar cell production requires a reproducible {{description of the}} relevant material defects and a classification scheme that is capable to rate as-cut wafers from unknown manufacturers. Both needs are addressed in this work. We introduce an image processing framework that allows {{the various types of}} crystallization-related defects visible in photoluminescence images to be detected quantitatively and thus enables a complete wafer description in terms of defects. The importance of different features within this defect characteristic is weighted by predicting the open-circuit voltage of solar cells with aluminum back-surface field as well as passivated emitter and rear cells with a stepwise extension of the model. The resulting robust classification scheme is successfully evaluated on a set of 7500 wafers, which represents the whole spectrum of material types and qualities that are currently available at the market. A comparison of defect signatures in high-performance multi-crystalline and standard multi-crystalline silicon materials underlines the relevance of additional features. As a result of this paper, we show that a regularized version of multi-linear regression models for quality prediction can optimize simpler linear models by adding selected features to the defect characteristic leading to mean absolute prediction errors of 2. 2 [*]mV for solar cells with aluminum back-surface field and 2. 9 [*]mV for passivated emitter and rear cells solar cells in a true blind test...|$|R

Therefore, new methods for improving the yield are emerging, including inspection and review methods with sufficient resolution and throughput. Existing industrial tools cannot anymore fulfill these requirements for upcoming smaller and 3 D features, since they are performing {{at the edge of}} their performance. Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has the ability to accurately measure dimensions in the micrometer to nanometer scale. Examples of applications are surface roughness, channel height and width measurement, defect <b>inspection</b> in <b>wafers,</b> masks and flat panel displays. In most of these applications, the target area is very large, and, therefore, the throughput of the measurement {{plays an important role in}} the final production cost. Single SPM has never been able to compete with other inspection systems in terms of measurement speed, thus has not fulfilled the industry needs in throughput and cost. Further increase of the speed of the single SPM helps, but it still is far from the required throughput and, therefore, insufficient for high-volume manufacturing. Over the past three years, we have developed a revolutionary concept for a multiple miniaturized SPM heads system, which can inspect and measure many sites in parallel. The very high speed of each miniaturized SPM unit allow the user to scan many areas, each with the size of tens of micrometers, in a few seconds. This paper presents an overview of the technical developments and experimental results of the parallel SPM system for <b>wafer</b> and mask <b>inspection.</b> Precision and Microsystems EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|The EU-project SMARTIEHS (SMART InspEction {{system for}} High Speed and multi-functional testing of MEMS and MOEMS) {{develops}} a new inspection concept for MEMS and MOEMS (M(O) EMS) testing on the <b>wafer</b> level. The <b>inspection</b> systems on market today {{are based on}} a serial approach inspecting one M(O) EMS structure at the time. The SMARTIEHS concept is based on a parallel approach. A wafer-to-wafer inspection concept is adopted from the electronic probing cards in the micro electronics industry. In SMARTIEHS a micro-optical probing wafer is aligned on top of the M(O) EMS wafer under investigation. The 4 -inch probing wafer contains a 5 x 5 array of micro-optical interferometers, allowing the inspection of 25 MEMS structures within one measurement cycle. The measurement time can thus be reduced by a factor of 25. This factor can be easily increased by extending the size of the probing wafer. In the project two different types of interferometers are developed to demonstrate the multifunctional approach of the system. A laser interferometer is applied for the detection of the resonance frequency and the amplitude distribution, while a low coherent interferometer is applied for the measurement of shape and deformation. A 5 x 5 channel Smart Pixel camera array detects the interference signals. This paper presents the design of the micro-optical low coherent interferometer array. The configuration is based on the well known Mirau-interferometer. The main challenge is the realisation of the array concept based on micro-optical components produced with standard micro-fabrication processes on the wafer level. This results in special requirements both for the optical design of the interferometer, the micro- fabrication processes, and for the scanning system. The interferometer array consists of several wafers, mounted in a wafer stack. The essential parts are: a microlens array, a beam splitter wafer and a reference mirror array. The paper will present different designs of micro-optical Mirau i...|$|R
