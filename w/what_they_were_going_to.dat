Executives often sensed <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do before they could explain why. He claimed in 1986 {{that one of the}} reasons for this is the complexity of strategic decisions and the resultant information uncertainty.|$|E
25|$|Omniscience is the {{capacity}} to know everything that {{there is to know}} (included in which are all future events), and is a property often attributed to a creator deity. Omniscience implies the existence of destiny. Some authors have claimed that free will cannot coexist with omniscience. One argument asserts that an omniscient creator not only implies destiny but a form of high level predeterminism such as hard theological determinism or predestination – that they have independently fixed all events and outcomes in the universe in advance. In such a case, even if an individual could have influence over their lower level physical system, their choices in regard to this cannot be their own, {{as is the case with}} libertarian free will. Omniscience features as an incompatible-properties argument for the existence of God, known as the argument from free will, and is closely related to other such arguments, for example the incompatibility of omnipotence with a good creator deity (i.e. if a deity knew <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> choose, then they are responsible for letting them choose it).|$|E

500|$|Accordingly, one of {{the main}} events was the Intercontinental Championship match between Bret Hart and Davey Boy Smith, brothers-in-law in real life as Smith was married to Diana Hart, Bret's sister. On {{television}} broadcasts leading up to SummerSlam, interviews with Diana and her mother Helen portrayed the family as being torn apart by the upcoming match. Bruce Hart publicly supported Smith, while Owen Hart sided with his brother Bret. Diana stated that she did not know who she wanted to win the match, as she had close ties to both men. She ultimately stated that she simply hoped that neither wrestler would get hurt. Prior to the match, Smith was hospitalized with a legitimate staph infection in his knee, which he suffered during a match with Mike Sharpe on July 20 in Worcester, Massachusetts (the fact was revealed by his wife Diana years later on the Hart & Soul documentary); despite the concerns about his health, he decided to wrestle the match as planned. Bret Hart later revealed {{in an interview that he}} doubted the legitimacy of the injury and that he believed Davey Boy in fact had a drug problem and that in the two months prior to their match he could not contact him to sort out <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do at Wembley, and when they finally got to the stadium Smith revealed that he had not slept in over 48 hours. However, Hart also stated that as bad as Smith's personal issues were, he [...] "sucked it up" [...] and hit every spot in the match.|$|E

2500|$|General Norman Schwarzkopf, who {{commanded}} US forces {{during the}} Gulf War against Iraq in 1991, served as Trưởng's adviser in the 1960s {{when he was}} deployed to South Vietnam as a major during a campaign at Ia Drang. He wrote in his autobiography It Doesn't Take A Hero, that Trưởng [...] "did not look like my idea of a military genius: only five feet seven … very skinny, with hunched shoulders and a head that seemed too big for his body … His face was pinched and intense … {{and there was always}} a cigarette hanging from his lips. Yet he was revered by his officers and troopsand feared by those North Vietnamese commanders who knew of his ability." [...] Schwarzkopf said that Trưởng was [...] "the most brilliant tactical commander I'd ever known" [...] and that [...] "by visualizing the terrain and drawing on his experience fighting the enemy for fifteen years, Truong showed an uncanny ability to predict <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do".|$|E

2500|$|As the {{television}} ratings of The A-Team fell dramatically {{during the fourth}} season, the format was changed for the show's final season in 1986–87 {{in a bid to}} win back viewers. After years on the run from the authorities, the A-Team is finally apprehended by the military. General Hunt Stockwell, a mysterious CIA operative played by Robert Vaughn, propositions them to work for him, whereupon he will arrange for their pardons upon successful completion of several suicide missions. In order to do so, the A-Team must first escape from their captivity. With the help of a new character, Frankie [...] "Dishpan Man" [...] Santana, Stockwell fakes their deaths before a military firing squad. The new status of the A-Team, no longer working for themselves, remained {{for the duration of the}} fifth season while Eddie Velez and Robert Vaughn received star billing along with the principal cast. The missions that the team had to perform in season five were somewhat reminiscent of , and based more around political espionage than beating local thugs, also usually taking place in foreign countries, including successfully overthrowing an island dictator, the rescue of a scientist from East Germany, and recovering top secret Star Wars defense information from Soviet hands. These changes proved unsuccessful with viewers, however, and ratings continued to decline. Only 13 episodes aired in the fifth season. [...] In what was supposed to be the final episode, [...] "The Grey Team" [...] (although [...] "Without Reservations" [...] was broadcast on NBC as the last first-run episode in March 1987), Hannibal, after being misled by Stockwell one time too many, tells him that the team will no longer work for him. At the end, the team discusses <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do if they get their pardon, and it is implied that they would continue doing what they were doing as the A-Team. [...] The character of Howling Mad Murdock can be seen in the final scene wearing a T-shirt that says, [...] "fini".|$|E
