The reason why boys find it so difficult to saw, is because the teeth do not generally spread very much, and so the kerf is narrow. Still, the back of the saw would run in it well enough, without sticking, if they were to saw perfectly straight. But they generally make the saw twist or wind a little, and then the back of the saw rubs upon one side or the other; and sticks. Now, Raymond's plan was to make the teeth set off, each side, so far as to make the kerf very wide, and then he thought that Caleb would be able to make it go, especially as the saw was very narrow.|$|E

Wire-EDMing {{process has}} been more {{accepted}} for cutting and slicing silicon wafer {{as it can provide}} a cut with less crack and chipping due to low effect of mechanical stresses. In order to provide a deep analysis of the process, the wire-EDMing performances and cut surface characteristics of p-type (100) monocrystalline silicon wafer have been experimentally investigated in this study. The results have shown that <b>wide</b> <b>kerf</b> width, high material removal rate, large electrode wear and rough cut surface can be obtained under the condition of high open voltage and rough cutting mode. Some micrographs of cut surface morphology have been also reported and discussed, where many craters and small holes can be apparently seen on the machined surface...|$|E
40|$|Grasping {{the wooden}} handle of a dozukime saw with both hands, I make a rip-cut into {{a block of}} eastern white pine, leaving behind a 1 / 64 -inch <b>wide</b> <b>kerf.</b> I am cutting a dovetail: a wood joint {{developed}} over five-thousand {{years ago by the}} hands of our ancestors. Even now, a well-fitted dovetail joint remains one of the strongest, most elegant ways to join wood. I knew nothing about traditional woodworking when I first picked up a hand-plane, but I was soon inspired by the richness of the craft: the quality of a hand-planed finish, the spirit of craftsmanship, and the nature of material. I was amazed by the wealth of knowledge embodied in craftwork. The tools and materials I encountered spoke to me; I learned to care for them and for my work. How would the things I make endure through time? How would the things I make affect others? In an era where materialism has come to represent a spiritless relationship to the things around us, traditions of craft can teach us how to imbue the human spirit in our work. After making a harvest table, four chairs, ninety-four earthenware pots, and a lamp, I reflect on the act of making as a means of discovery. Making affects our thinking and our approach to material and environment. Making can help us develop a craftsmanâ€™s capacity to listen, a great respect for material, and a desire to make better objects for posterity. Making is learning...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} laser {{machining}} of silicon wafer at various process parameters. The {{objective of this}} thesis is to investigate the effect of laser machining parameters on the cut surface quality and determine the feasible laser machining parameters that can machine silicon wafer. The thesis describes how machining parameters and air assist gas affects cut surface quality. The silicon wafer was machined by laser with and without air assists. Principally, two experimental sets with different cutting speed and laser power were designed in statistical software. The kerf widths and quality were observed under microscopes. The results then were analyzed using statistica software. The analysis indicated that cutting speed has significant effect to the kerf width and laser cutting with air assists produced <b>wider</b> <b>kerf.</b> Result obtained also showed that laser cutting without air assists produced better cut surface quality. The feasible machining parameter of silicon is estimated at 1. 0 - 2. 0 mm/min for cutting velocity, 0. 80 - 0. 94 watt for laser power in laser cutting without air assist and 1. 0 - 4. 0 mm/min for cutting velocity, 0. 80 - 0. 90 watt for laser power in laser cutting with air assist...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRemote {{fusion cutting}} (RFC) is an {{interesting}} industrial process compared to traditional laser cutting. It is because traditional laser cutting is limiting travel speed and accessibility due to the required positioning of the cutting head just above the workpiece for providing a cutting gas pressure. For RFC this pressure is created by the vapor, which is formed when the laser beam evaporates the cut material. The drawback of RFC compared to traditional laser cutting is a worse cut quality, <b>wide</b> cut <b>kerf</b> and a slower travel speed. The contribution {{of this paper is}} an experimental investigation, which determined the process window for RFC in stainless steel with a single mode fiber laser. The process variables: travel speed, focus position, power and sheet thickness were investigated. Based on the results of the experiments and process knowledge the aim of this work was to determine and describe the most important driving mechanisms for understanding and modelling the RFC process. The purpose is to deepen the understanding of the mechanisms in the process and find the factors, which can improve the performance and also determine the limitations. The validation results show that the developed model of the RFC process gives a similar process window as the experimental results for the tested parameters and variation of travel speed and focus position...|$|R
