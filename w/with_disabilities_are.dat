5|$|Sports in Hong Kong are a {{significant}} part of its culture. Due mainly to British influence going {{as far back as the}} late 19th century, Hong Kong had an earlier introduction to Western athletics compared to other Asia regions. Football, cricket, basketball, swimming, badminton, table tennis, cycling and running have the most participants and spectators. In 2009, Hong Kong successfully organised the V East Asian Games. Other major international sporting events including the Equestrian at the 2008 Summer Olympics, Hong Kong Sevens, Hong Kong Marathon, AFC Asian Cup, EAFF East Asian Cup, Hong Kong Tennis Classic, Premier League Asia Trophy, and Lunar New Year Cup are also held in the territory. , there were 32 Hong Kong athletes from seven sports ranking in world's Top 20, 29 athletes in six sports in Asia top 10 ranking. Moreover, Hong Kong athletes <b>with</b> <b>disabilities</b> <b>are</b> equally impressive in their performance , having won four world championships and two Asian Championships.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} developments of the disability rights movement was the growth of the independent living movement, which emerged in California in the 1960s through the efforts of Edward Roberts and other wheelchair-using individuals. This movement, a subset of the disability rights movement, postulates that people <b>with</b> <b>disabilities</b> <b>are</b> the best experts on their needs, and therefore they must take the initiative, individually and collectively, in designing and promoting better solutions and must organize themselves for political power. Besides de-professionalization and self-representation, the independent living movement's ideology comprises de-medicalization of disability, de-institutionalization and cross-disability (i.e. inclusion in the independent living movement regardless of diagnoses). Similarly, The Architectural Barriers Act was passed in 1968, mandating that federally constructed buildings and facilities be accessible to people with physical disabilities. This act is generally considered to be the first ever-federal disability rights legislation. Unfortunately for those with cognitive disabilities, their disability made it more difficult to be the best expert of their own needs, hindering their ability to self-advocate as their wheelchair-using counterparts could. Self-representation was much more difficult for those who could not articulate their thoughts, leading to their dependence on others to carry on the movement.|$|E

[...] Accordingly, assistive technology can be found in sports ranging from local community recreation to the elite Paralympic Games.

2500|$|Board of Education v. Rowley is {{the most}} {{significant}} court case concerning the interpretation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. It was the only occasion the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on the requirement of public schools to provide an appropriate education to students with disabilities until Endrew F. v. Douglas County School Dist. RE–1 was decided in 2017. It is estimated that it has been cited by at least 3,279 cases. In a 2008 article published in the Journal of Law and Education, Julie F. Mead and Mark A. Paige described Rowley as [...] "the primary precedent whenever the educational rights of children <b>with</b> <b>disabilities</b> <b>are</b> considered." [...] Likewise, in a 2012 article, Mark C. Weber wrote that Rowley [...] "remains the most important American special education case ever decided." [...] Joyce O. Eckrem and Eliza J. McArthur stated in 2001 that Rowley {{has been described as a}} [...] "seminal case", though they also recognized that the case did not [...] "provide clarity on the issue of appropriateness" [...] and that the Court only [...] "cryptically addressed" [...] the question of how to measure benefits for students. In a 2005 article published in the Suffolk University Law Review, Lester Aron also noted that circuit courts of appeal have issued conflicted rulings when interpreting Rowley.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES. The {{effect of}} {{occupational}} therapy education on students' perceived attitudes toward persons <b>with</b> <b>disabilities</b> <b>was</b> studied. METHOD. The perceived attitudes of 144 occupational therapy students toward persons <b>with</b> <b>disabilities</b> <b>were</b> measured before (retrospective pretest) and after (posttest) the students attended formal professional {{education at the}} University of Alberta. RESULTS. Posttest scores {{were significantly higher than}} the retrospective pretest scores, indicating that students' attitudes became more positive after they commenced formal professional education. The posttest scores of students at various levels of education, however, did not show any significant difference. CONCLUSION. On the basis of these observations, a positive but nonlinear relationship between occupational therapy education and attitudes toward persons <b>with</b> <b>disabilities</b> <b>was</b> postulated. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
