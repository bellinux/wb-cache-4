5|$|Chaplin {{had interviewed}} several actresses {{to play the}} blind flower girl but was unimpressed <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>all.</b> While seeing a film shoot with bathing women in a Santa Monica beach, he found a casual acquaintance, Virginia Cherrill. Cherrill waved {{and asked if she}} would ever get the chance to work with him. After a series of poor auditions from other actresses, Chaplin {{eventually}} invited her to do a screen test. She was the first actress to subtly and convincingly act blind on camera due to her near-sightedness, and Cherrill signed a contract on November 1, 1928.|$|E
5|$|In the Halo universe, {{humans had}} {{advanced}} to a comparable level {{of technology to}} the Forerunners but, after losing a war <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> <b>all</b> human technology was destroyed and their intelligence reduced, leaving them in a subsistence economy with measures to prevent redevelopment of electronics. Humans {{are aware of the}} other, space-faring races, but their interactions are limited to visits from Forerunners as {{they do not have the}} technology to make contact themselves, they live in wooden buildings and have only primitive steam engines. The San'Shyuum (or Prophets as they are referred to in the Halo games) were also defeated by the Forerunners but their technology was not destroyed; they were instead confined to their home solar system and forbidden to manufacture weapons.|$|E

25|$|By the 20th century, the Asiatic race {{theory and}} its various offshoots were {{abandoned}} but were superseded by two related theories: the eurocentric Hamitic hypothesis, asserting that a Caucasian racial group moved into North and East Africa from early prehistory subsequently bringing <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> advanced agriculture, technology and civilization, and the Dynastic race theory, proposing that Mesopotamian invaders {{were responsible for}} the dynastic civilization of Egypt (c. 3000 BC).

The largest armed merchant ship was the Resolutie, of 700 tons. She had a valuable cargo and as passengers the colours and staff of the Dutch 23rd European Battalion. The third vessel was the brig Ceres, of 12 guns and 70 men. Pellew had too few men to {{be able to deal with}} the prisoners so he paroled the officers to the governor of Samarang and gave up the all the other men against a receipt.

25|$|Meanwhile, {{the friends}} of Badan Chandra Borphukan went {{to the court of}} Burmese monarch Bodawpaya and appealed for help. Bodawpaya, owing to his {{marriage}} to Hemo Aideo, had an alliance with Chandrakanta Singha, immediately dispatched a fresh army of 30,000 men under a general named Alungmingi, also known as Kiamingi Borgohain. The Assamese army resisted the Burmese in Phulpanichiga near the Janji River on February 17, 1819. Some sources stated that the battle took place in Machkhowa in Sibsagar district. Initially, the Assamese resisted Burmese with some spirit, but at a critical point in the engagement, their commander lost his nerve. They were defeated and beat a hasty retreat to Jorhat. Purandar Singha, his father Brajanath Gohain and Ruchinath Burhagohain fled to Guwahati taking <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> the valuables from the royal treasury, worth 3.5 million rupees. The triumphant Burmese now search for Chandrakanta Singha, led him from his retreat and properly installed him on the throne.|$|E
25|$|When visiting {{friends or}} family and staying <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> <b>all</b> foreign {{visitors}} are required to register with the Aliens Department of the local MUP {{in the place of}} the intended stay, within twenty-four hours of entering the country. At the Department, they will fill in a form (a sort of a landing card) made of two parts (both parts should be filled in). The form is processed by the officer in charge and a stamped segment is returned to the applicant. Visitors should always have this certificate on them during the entire stay in the country together with their passport or (for certain nationals) ID card. Foreigners who, at the time of registering with the police, know the date of their departure from Serbia, should mention it to the officer processing their registration in order to avoid additional visit to the same police department for de-registration. The registration is free of charge. At passport control at the port of exit, the certificate is collected by the immigration officer. Failing to complete the registration may result in fines.|$|E

25|$|It {{was agreed}} that the {{evacuation}} of the insurgents will be conducted with the logistical support from U.S. military servicemen of the 101 airborne division. It was also agreed by the government that during the evacuation, the insurgents would take their weapons, and their dead and wounded with them. The details of the logistics of the evacuation were organised by the USA special envoy for the Balkans, Peter Feith. The evacuation started at 17:00 and was conducted by U.S. Army Personnel from the American contingent within KFOR in Kosovo which were based at Camp Able Sentry at the Skopje International Airport. The U.S. servicemen tasked with the evacuation of the NLA insurgents passed Macedonian and entered the village, taking <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> of the NLA members {{that were in the}} village. On their way towards the evacuation route, however, they stumbled upon roadblocks placed by groups of ethnic Macedonian civilians that were protesting the evacuation. After the government sent representatives to talk to the civilians, they agreed to lift the roadblocks and allow the convoy to proceed as planned. The convoy transported the insurgents to the village of Nikushtak, on NLA controlled territory.|$|E
25|$|During his {{recovery}} from his serious traffic accident in December 2008, Way acted unofficially as a backroom coach and scout for Yeovil, {{and after his}} retirement, in February 2010, Yeovil manager and his former teammate Terry Skiverton offered him a role as the club's technical coach. After the demoting of Terry Skiverton to assistant manager {{and the return of}} Gary Johnson in January 2012, Way remained in his role as technical coach. Way was involved in his third promotion with Yeovil as they defeated Brentford 2–1 to win the 2013 Football League One play-off Final and earn promotion to the Championship {{for the first time in}} the club's history. Following the club's promotion Way, along with Johnson and Skiverton, signed a new two-year contract, after his agreement of a new contract the title of Way's role was changed to first team coach. Following the sacking of Gary Johnson in February 2015, with the club bottom of League One, Way was promoted to acting assistant manager to Terry Skiverton. Having failed to arrest the club's plight and <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> but confirmed as relegated from League Two, the club demoted Skiverton and Way back to their assistant and first team coaches roles respectively, hiring Paul Sturrock as the club's new first team manager.|$|E
25|$|German tactics for the {{offensive}} involved an initial intense artillery barrage, {{followed by an}} immediate infantry attack by the Volksgrenadier divisions supported with light assault guns like the Sturmgeschütz IV. This initial attack with relatively non-mobile and relatively expendable troops was intended to clear major roads {{for use by the}} SS Panzer divisions, which would then rapidly move to capture bridges on the Meuse river for the final drive to Antwerp. These armored divisions were employed in a much more organized and controlled fashion, and with better leadership, than was the standard in U.S. armies. The German concept of the armored division involved independent units that carried <b>with</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> their supporting elements, making them more mobile, flexible, and able to concentrate greater force at the point of attack. Shock and high speed would overwhelm resistance, as did the first drive from the Ardennes in 1940. These tactics made up what was referred to in the press as the blitzkrieg, or lightning war. This evolution of mechanized attack was more sophisticated than tactics used by the American army. The German command expected that the allied high command would take weeks to adjust to the impact. But Hitler failed to consider the constricted, winding, often unpaved roads of the northern Ardennes and vastly underrated the capabilities of the American units on the northern shoulder.|$|E
