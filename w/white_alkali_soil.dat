The experiment uses <b>white</b> <b>alkali</b> <b>soil</b> amended with zeolitic tuff and peat as a substrate. There has been noticed a better behavior of the plants grown on cultivated soil amended with 15 % zeolitic tuff and neutral peat. The chlorophyll content index was higher in plants grown on cultivated soil amended with 15 % zeolitic tuff both when combined with neutral peat (14. 0 and 30. 6) or acidic peat (18. 9 and 26. 2) than in plants grown in soils that were amended with 20 % zeolitic tuff.

These <b>alkali</b> <b>soils</b> are not saline but their soil solution is more concentrated than in brown steppe soils.

40|$|Virgin <b>alkali</b> (sodic) <b>soils</b> {{have a high}} pH {{and high}} {{exchangeable}} Na and are often barren. Blue-green algae, however, tolerate excess Na and grow extensively on the soil surface in wet seasons. Experiments using a highly degraded <b>alkali</b> <b>soil</b> (silt loam, pH 10. 3, electrical conductivity 3. 5 dS m- 1, 90 % exchangeable Na) were conducted in soil columns, with or without gypsum, in order to study the influence of waterlogging on the growth of indigenous and inoculated blue-green algae and hence, soil reclamation. The growth of indigenous blue-green algae was initially slow in <b>alkali</b> <b>soil,</b> due to the high pH and exchangeable Na, and depressed in gypsum-amended soil, due to excess Ca. Inoculation hastened the establishment of blue-green algae in both the unamended <b>alkali</b> <b>soil</b> and the gypsum-amended soil, overcoming the adverse influence of excess Na in the former and excess Ca in the latter. Gypsum was effective in amelioration (pH 9. 05, electrical conductivity 1. 2 dS m- 1, 41 % exchangeable Na after 11 weeks) but blue-green algae were ineffective even after 17 weeks. In combination with gypsum, blue-green algae had no additional effect, and the C and N increases due {{to the growth of}} indigenous or inoculated blue-green algae were insignificant. <b>Alkali</b> <b>soil</b> reclamation by biological methods requires mobilization of Ca from native soil calcite and the exchange of Ca for Na in the exchange complex. The ineffectiveness of blue-green algae was ascribed to their inability to mobilize Ca. It is argued that current theories favouring blue-green algae as a biological amendment to bring about <b>alkali</b> <b>soil</b> reclamation are untenable and are not comparable with an effective chemical amendment such as gypsum. © 1991 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
