30|$|<b>Written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> (<b>WCF),</b> one of {{the most}} debated issues, is heavily {{researched}} in second language (L 2) writing literature. On the one hand, Truscott (1996, 1999, 2001, 2004, 2007, 2009, 2010) has openly questioned the effectiveness of WCF in L 2 writing. He argues that WCF should have no place in L 2 writing classes. In response to Truscott, Ferris and other researchers (e.g., Bitchener 2008, 2012 a, 2012 b; Chandler 2003; Ferris 1995, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2015) have provided evidence for the positive effect of WCF on improving L 2 writing.|$|E
30|$|Dealing with learner errors is a {{critical}} aspect of second language (L 2) teaching. For many language instructors, correcting errors and commenting on students’ written assignments {{are among the most}} common functions of their daily work. Yet, the effectiveness of <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> for improving L 2 accuracy is still the subject of much debate. In particular, the role of <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> 1 (<b>WCF)</b> has been a controversial topic in L 2 writing and L 2 acquisition research. Although pedagogical discussions of L 2 learners’ written errors {{can be traced back to}} pre- 1980 composition studies (e.g., Cohen and Robbins 1976; Shaughnessy 1977), contemporary debates on WCF have been mainly inspired by Truscott’s (1996) thought-provoking essay. In it, Truscott writes: “substantial research shows [grammar correction] to be ineffective and none shows it to be helpful in any interesting sense” (p. 327). Truscott’s strong opposition to WCF has faced numerous challenges and received critiques from researchers, who, through empirical research or other scholarly synthesis, have argued that grammar feedback is essential for second language acquisition (SLA) and should remain an important component of L 2 instruction 2 (e.g., Guénette 2007; Ferris 2004; Hyland and Hyland 2006). Clearly, there are several points of contention over WCF. There is, however, widespread consensus that: WCF is a complex, multivariate subject on which there is inadequate research adequately (Bitchener and Ferris 2012). Fortunately, there has been a steady growth of WCF research over the past two decades, with more and more studies moving from descriptive analyses toward experimental designs. The objective of these studies is to investigate WCF’s effects on L 2 learners’ acquisition of particular grammatical structures (e.g., Bitchener 2008; Sheen 2007).|$|R
40|$|<b>Written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> {{has proven}} to be a key tool to improve {{students}} writing. Many previous researchers have proven so. Teacher gets to decide their very own <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback.</b> There are many types of <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> that can be used in the classroom. They are direct <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback,</b> indirect, and metalinguistic. The paper presents the effect of using indirect <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> to improve students’ writing accuracy. The paper is intended to find the best <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> strategy in the classroom. The study is conducted to 35 low-proficiency ESL students. The writing pretest and posttest are used to measure students’ writing accuracy. The researcher uses a t-test to analyze the data. The result is satisfying. 35 students have shown statistically significant progress in their writing accuracy. The posttest result has outscored the pretest score.

The article provides a brief overview of the history of giving feedback and of some contemporary views within this field. Special attention is paid to cognitive perspectives, such as the influence of <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> on shortterm memory, the influence of focused and unfocused <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> on error correction, the influence of <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> on a particular category of error, the influence of direct and indirect <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> and combinations of various types of <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback,</b> and the influence of educational background and L 2 learning background on the effectiveness of <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> in terms of sociocultural perspectives.

30|$|<b>Written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> (<b>WCF)</b> is also {{commonly}} referred as grammar correction or written error correction in SLA research (Ferris 2012). In this study, however, we adopt a broad definition of “written corrective feedback” {{by using the}} term to refer to instructors’ corrective activities toward both grammatical and content aspects of students’ written assignments. This decision is based upon two considerations: first, the central research question of the reported study is ELF learners’ perceptions {{of the relation between}} WCF and the overall effectiveness of their writing; second, instructors from disciplines such as communication, sociology, and political science also conduct extensive WCF activities, yet these activities’ focuses often go beyond grammatical errors.|$|E
40|$|<b>Written</b> <b>Corrective</b> <b>Feedback</b> (<b>WCF)</b> is a {{controversial}} topic among theorists and researchers in L 2 studies. Ellis, Sheen, Murakami, and Takashima (2008) identify two dominant dichotomies in this regard, that is focused vs. unfocused WCF and direct vs. indirect WCF. This study considered both dichotomies in a matrix format, {{resulted in the}} recognition of four types of operationally defined WCF, and aimed at: (1) investigating the effects of four types of WCF (i. e., focused direct CF, unfocused direct CF, focused indirect CF, and unfocused indirect CF) on intermediate EFL learners’ writing performance; (2) finding out the most effective type of WCF for intermediate EFL learners’ writing performance; (3) determining learners’ attitudes toward the effectiveness of using WCF and the types which they had received. After conducting Nelson English Language Test (Test 300 D), out of 140 male and female Iranian EFL learners, 120 of them were selected as intermediate learners, aging from 14 - 18. The subjects were then assigned randomly to four homogeneous groups (each group including 30 participants). The pre-test and post-test both included a writing test which assessed learners’ writing performance, and then their scores were analyzed by using analytic marking scale. The results indicated that, learners outperformed {{in all of the}} four groups, validating WCF as an effective technique which can be used in EFL classes. A clear implication of the study is that WCF types (specially unfocused direct CF) should be emphasized as an essential tool for developing writing ability of intermediate EFL learners.

This study investigated how ESL students and teachers perceive the usefulness of different types and amounts of WCF, and also the reasons they have for their preferences. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from 31 ESL teachers and 33 ESL students by means of written questionnaires.

However, research on video-based <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> (VWCF) in EFL/ESL writing instructions so far has only revealed its qualitative strengths (Stannard, 2008; Mathisen, 2012) —that is, in terms of students’ responses towards its application, a gap that the current paper intends to address. The present study reported in this paper is a classroom action research (CAR) aiming at increasing the writing accuracy of a group of students of a state university in Bali, Indonesia through the integration of video in the <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> practice. The <b>writing</b> instruction in the study is carried out in a blended learning fashion combining the traditional learning mode with an email-based correspondence between the tutor and the students.

Four students’ compositions in an English course with writing components were examined. Then, the students were interviewed. The results of analyses reveal, though all the four students were motivated to study by a compulsory provincial English test, students of significantly lower proficiency were motivated to significantly more independent learning activities after class. As a result, they achieved significantly greater improvement. It is also revealed that WCF did not lead to simplified writing in terms of lexical diversity and structural complexity, for the students knew the grading criteria for the written task in the compulsory test.

The results showed that students who received direct <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> outperformed students who received indirect <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> in the post-test. In addition, the results also showed that although the mean number of errors made by indirect feedback group did not decrease in post-test, the mean number of errors made decrease in their revised texts. Thus, it can be concluded that indirect <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> was an effective tool in helping students retaining their language learning over a period of time. Interviews were also conducted to gain insights on other factors that affect students’ writing performance. Based on the results gained, two themes which influence the effectiveness of <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> on students’ <b>writing</b> are motivation and scaffolding. Three anecdotal findings were also collected through the interviews. They are related to students expressing their concern on content-related knowledge when writing an essay. In addition, students also stated that teachers should apply mix strategies when correcting different types of errors made by the students based on the severity.

The study findings indicated no significant differences between male and female teachers in considering “time” as the main factor in following a particular strategy for written corrective feedback (93 %). The results from the semi-structured interviews highlighted the need for further research in written corrective feedback in the Saudi context to address serious issues related to the teachers’ work-load. Some recommendations were identified for further research in written corrective feedback...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} is a quasi-experimental study investigating {{the effect of}} different types of teacher <b>Written</b> <b>Corrective</b> <b>Feedback</b> (<b>WCF)</b> on Iranian EFL learners’ writing accuracy in using two functions of English articles (the first mention and anaphoric reference) and simple past tense (regular and irregular). Ninety-four Iranian learners of English were assigned into three experimental groups of direct feedback group (n= 24), indirect feedback group (n= 24), direct plus indirect feedback group (n= 24), and one pilot group (n= 22). The participating groups’ homogeneity was checked by their performance in the proficiency test and the pre-test. During six treatment sessions, each of the three groups received feedback type. The papers with attached comments were returned to the participants. On two occasions (pre-test and post-test), the participants completed a picture description task. The results of one-way ANOVA revealed a statistically significant difference in the performance of the three groups. Furthermore, Scheffe post-hoc analysis indicated that the direct group outperformed direct plus indirect group, and direct plus indirect group outperformed the indirect group...|$|E
30|$|Teachers’ writing {{proficiency}} {{and writing}} assessment ability {{and their role}} in improving writing instruction in second language learning classrooms are issues {{that have not been}} investigated empirically and rigorously. To bridge the gap, we investigated the writing proficiency, writing assessment ability, and <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> beliefs and practices of Iranian English teachers who gave feedback on learners’ writings.|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{findings}} {{have suggested that}} what teachers do in the classroom mirrors what they believe and these beliefs often influence their instructional decisions (Farrell 2 ̆ 6 Lim, 2005). Research in teacher belief is vast and diverse (Borg, 2003) as is investigation {{about the effectiveness of}} <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b>	per se (Ferris, 2006; Truscott, 2009); however, little is known about teachers 2 ̆ 7 beliefs about <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> (Lee, 2009). Therefore, this study aimed at investigating Brazilian EFL teachers 2 ̆ 7 beliefs about grammar-based feedback on L 2 writing {{and the extent to which}} their beliefs are related to their perceived classroom practice. Fifteen Brazilian EFL teachers answered a five-point Likert scale survey. Results suggest that Brazilian teachers tend to believe that form-focused correction is a recommendable instructional approach. In addition, the qualitative analysis of the teachers 2 ̆ 7 perception of classroom practice implied that their pedagogical decisions are likely to be shaped by beliefs and contextual factors...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that a {{considerable}} proportion of today’s writing programs operate according to the principles of genre-based instruction, research has not adequately dealt with the teaching of various genres (e. g., job application letters). Nor has research, to date, attempted {{to address the issue of}} <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> in conjunction with genre-based instruction. This study, therefore, aimed to investigate the impact of <b>written</b> <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> in the context of genre-based instruction on job application letters. To this end, 120 Iranian advanced-level EFL learners at Kish Institute of Science and Technology participated in the present study. After administering the TOEFL test, 80 students scoring within ± 1 SD of the mean score were randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups?namely, Direct Feedback Group or Indirect Feedback Group. Having sat a writing pretest, the participants received genre-based instruction on how to compose job application letters. Meanwhile, they were supplied with direct or indirect feedback on their writing. Following this instruction, a writing posttest was administered, the results of which showed that direct <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> was more effective than indirect <b>corrective</b> <b>feedback</b> in the context of genre-based instruction on letters of job application...|$|R
