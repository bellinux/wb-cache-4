25|$|In {{the first}} {{instance}} capitulations were granted separately to each Christian state, beginning with the Genoese in 1453, which entered into peaceful relations with the Ottoman Empire. Afterwards new capitulations were obtained which summed up in one document earlier concessions, and added to them in general terms <b>whatever</b> <b>had</b> been conceded {{to one or more}} other states; a stipulation which became a most favored nation article.|$|E
25|$|In {{the modern}} times, {{according}} to Merezhkovsky, both monastic and ascetic Christianity {{will cease to}} exist. Art would not just adopt religious forms, but {{become an integral part}} of religion, the latter taken in broader concept. Human evolution as he saw it, would lead to merging of <b>whatever</b> <b>had</b> been polarized: sex and spirit, religion and culture, male and female, et cetera — bringing about Kingdom Come, not 'out there', but 'here on Earth'.|$|E
25|$|The {{collapse}} of the Zhou initiated the Spring and Autumn period, named after Confucius' Spring and Autumn Annals. It {{was a time of}} war between states, when the earlier semi-feudal system fell into decline and trade began to flourish. Competition between states led to rapid technological advancement. Iron tools became available, producing agricultural surpluses that ended <b>whatever</b> <b>had</b> once existed of the well-field system. Towards the end of this era, the introduction of iron technology caused the complete {{collapse of}} the feudal system and ushered in a new era of development. Chinese developments in this era included the first isolation of elemental sulphur in the sixth century.|$|E

25|$|With {{his freedom}} restored, the Doctor chose to {{counteract}} his extended exile by seeking as much non-human company as possible. During this period, the Doctor encountered {{all manner of}} unusual beings – from a species that at cursory glance resembled the Earth tiger (The Year of Intelligent Tigers), to water spirits, to talking apes from another dimension. Though at times the Doctor seemed somewhat cold – as when he seemed more concerned about damaged plums than a dead man (Eater of Wasps) – he retained his passion for life in all forms. Although his amnesia remained a bother, the Doctor acknowledged that <b>whatever</b> <b>had</b> happened to him had happened for a reason, and {{he might as well}} make use of the advantages it offered.|$|E
25|$|Even {{a return}} to RFK Stadium {{was not enough to}} cure <b>whatever</b> <b>had</b> been ailing United over the last 2 or 3 months of league play. United fell behind 2–0 against Columbus, but an attempt at a late rally came up short. A penalty kick by Rolfe put United on the scoreboard. Later, Saborio {{appeared}} to have tied the score in the 84th minute, off a through pass by Pontius, but the Costa Rican was controversially ruled offside. The result vaulted the Crew {{to the top of the}} standings in the Eastern Conference, while United slipped to 4th place. With dreams of MLS hardware slipping away, D.C. United still had top position in CONCACAF Champions League group play, which the team locked down in their final group match of 2015, a 3–3 draw in Jamaica, against Montego Bay United. The Jamaican side jumped out to an early lead when a quick restart caught out a really makeshift D.C. defense, that included Aguilar making his first start as a fullback, and Jalen Robinson making his first start as a center back. That goal was Montego Bay's first ever tally in CCL play. The home side extended the lead 3 minutes later and took what appeared to be a commanding 3-0 lead early in the second half on a penalty kick, after a phantom foul call against midfielder Jared Jeffrey. D.C. however rallied, with goals by Arrieta and Opare, and earned a draw and a point, when Michael Farfan collected a loose ball deep into stoppage time and aimed his shot into the top corner of the goal. The draw was the first CCL group match that D.C. United didn't win over the last two entries into CONCACAF play, but it did extend their CCL group play unbeaten streak to 8 games and left the team with 10 points, waiting to learn their seeding and knockout round opponent when Champions League play resumes in 2016.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, various gaming sites {{reported}} that an unnamed female former Tecmo employee had filed {{a sexual harassment}} suit against Itagaki. She claimed that Itagaki had made several unwanted sexual advances on her since 2003. While Itagaki admitted to kissing her, he claimed that <b>whatever</b> <b>had</b> gone between them had been consensual. Tecmo's ensuing investigation reached the conclusion that [...] "the allegations in question were {{a result of the}} former employee's desire to vent frustration over her own personal affair, and not indicative of sexual harassment." [...] Tecmo has also demoted Itagaki and the accuser for their mingling of [...] "personal affairs with their corporate responsibilities". Meanwhile, the court has found Itagaki innocent of the charges.|$|E
