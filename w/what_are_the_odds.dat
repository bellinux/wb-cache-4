2500|$|Several of Holt's friends {{confronted him}} {{about the dangers of}} his hobby, {{including}} his press secretary, Tony Eggleton, to whom he responded [...] "look Tony, <b>what</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> of a prime minister being drowned or taken by a shark?". On 20 May 1967, Holt had a close call while diving at Cheviot Beach on the Mornington Peninsula, where he became distressed and called for help. Pulled ashore by his diving companions, he remained conscious but turned purple and vomited a large amount of seawater. Holt attributed the incident to a leaking snorkel, and supposedly remarked [...] "that's the closest I have ever been to drowning in my life!". A few months later, on 5 August, he was spearfishing at Dunk Island on the Great Barrier Reef. He spent 25 minutes chasing a large coral trout, but eventually had to abandon the pursuit due to extreme shortness of breath.|$|E

[...] Dawn Fallik writing for The Wall Street Journal also gave the episode a negative review, saying [...] "The series started out so well and was so interesting. And then it all fell apart. Every week Big Jim did something bad. Someone else was killed. We never really found out much of the back story for, well, anyone, least of all the dome," [...] and then said [...] "Because it’s been renewed for Season 2 and Stephen King <b>is</b> writing <b>the</b> first episode.

60|$|Having {{repaired}} {{one day to}} his accustomed {{dinner at}} the White Horse ordinary, Mr. Warrington {{was pleased to see}} amongst the faces round the table the jolly, good-looking countenance of Parson Sampson, who <b>was</b> regaling <b>the</b> company when Harry entered, with stories and bons-mots, which kept them in roars of laughter. Though he had not been in London for some months, the parson had the latest London news, or what passed for such with the folks at <b>the</b> ordinary: <b>what</b> <b>was</b> doing in <b>the</b> King's house at Kensington; and what in the Duke's in Pall Mall: how Mr. Byng was behaving in prison, and who came to him: <b>what</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> at Newmarket, and who <b>was</b> <b>the</b> last reigning toast in Covent Garden;--the jolly chaplain could give the company news upon all these points,--news that might not be very accurate indeed, but was as good as if it <b>were</b> for <b>the</b> country gentlemen who heard it. For suppose that my Lord Viscount Squanderfield was ruining himself for Mrs. Polly, and Sampson called her Mrs. Lucy? that it was Lady Jane who was in love with the actor, and not Lady Mary? that it was Harry Hilton, of the Horse Grenadiers, who had the quarrel with Chevalier Solingen, at Marybone Garden, and not Tommy Ruffler, of the Foot Guards? The names and dates did not matter much. Provided <b>the</b> stories <b>were</b> lively and wicked, their correctness was of no great importance; and Mr. Sampson laughed and chattered away amongst his country gentlemen, charmed them with his spirits and talk, and drank his share of one bottle after another, for which his delighted auditory persisted in calling. A hundred years ago, the Abbe Parson, the clergyman who frequented the theatre, the tavern, the racecourse, the world of fashion, was no uncommon character in English society: his voice might <b>be</b> heard <b>the</b> loudest in the hunting-field; he could sing the jolliest song at the Rose or the Bedford Head, after <b>the</b> play <b>was</b> over at Covent Garden, and could call a main as well as any at the gaming-table.|$|R

"It don't matter," [...] said Foker, talking {{over the}} matter with Pen,--"a little sooner or a little later, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>odds?</b> I should have been plucked for my little-go again, I know I should--that Latin I cannot screw into my head, and my mamma's anguish would have broke out next term. The Governor will blow like an old grampus, I know he will,--well, we must stop till he gets his wind again. I shall {{probably}} go abroad and improve my mind with foreign travel. Yes, parly-voo's the ticket. It'ly, {{and that sort of}} thing. I'll go to Paris and learn to dance and complete my education. But it's not me I'm anxious about, Pen. As long as people drink beer I don't care,--it's about you I'm doubtful, my boy. You're going too fast, and can't keep up the pace, I tell you. It's not the fifty you owe me,--pay it or not when you like,--but it's the every-day pace, and I tell you it will kill you. You're livin' as if there was no end to the money in the stockin' at home. You oughtn't to give dinners, you ought to eat 'em. Fellows are glad to have you. You oughtn't to owe horse bills, you ought to ride other chaps' nags. You know no more about betting than I do about Algebra: the chaps will win your money as sure as you sport it. Hang me if you are not trying everything. I saw you sit down to ecarte last week at Trumpington's, and taking your turn with the bones after Ringwood's supper. They'll beat you at it, Pen, my boy, even if they play on the square, which. I don't say they don't, nor which I don't say they do, mind. But I won't play with 'em. You're no match for 'em. You ain't up to their weight. It's like little Black Strap standing up to Tom Spring,--the Black's a pretty fighter but, Law bless you, his arm ain't long enough to touch Tom,--and I tell you, you're going it with fellers beyond your weight. Look here--If you'll promise me never to bet nor touch a box nor a card, I'll let you off the two ponies." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{have seen}} sights that cannot be told, and heard stories that cannot be repeated: yet I never admired my poor race so much, nor (strange {{as it may}} seem) loved life {{more than in the}} settlement. A horror of moral beauty broods over the place: that's like bad Victor Hugo, but it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only way I can express the sense that lived with me all these days.

Well, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>odds?</b> They do their darg and do it with kindness and efficiency incredible; and we must take folk's virtues as we find them, and love the better part. Of old Damien, whose weaknesses and worse perhaps I heard fully, I think only <b>the</b> more. It <b>was</b> a European peasant: dirty, bigoted, untruthful, unwise, tricky, but superb with generosity, residual candour and fundamental good-humour: convince him he had done wrong (it might take hours of insult) and he would undo what he had done and like his corrector better. A man, with all the grime and paltriness of mankind, but a saint and hero all the more for that. [...] The place as regards scenery is grand, gloomy, and bleak. Mighty mountain walls descending sheer along the whole face of the island into a sea unusually deep; the front of the mountain ivied and furred with clinging forest, one viridescent cliff: about half-way from east to west, the low, bare, stony promontory edged in between the cliff and the ocean; the two little towns (Kalawao and Kalaupapa) seated on either side of it, as bare almost as bathing machines upon a beach; and the population - gorgons and chimaeras dire. All this tear of the nerves I bore admirably; and the day after I got away, rode twenty miles along the opposite coast and up into the mountains: they call it twenty, I <b>am</b> doubtful of <b>the</b> figures: I should guess it nearer twelve; but let me take credit for what residents allege; and I <b>was</b> riding again <b>the</b> day after, so I need say no more about health. Honolulu does not agree with me at all: I am always out of sorts there, with slight headache, blood to the head, etc. I had a good deal of work to do and did it with miserable difficulty; and yet all the time I have been gaining strength, as you see, which is highly encouraging. By <b>the</b> time I <b>am</b> done with this cruise I shall have the material for a very singular book of travels: names of strange stories and characters, cannibals, pirates, ancient legends, old Polynesian poetry, - never was so generous a farrago. I am going down now to get the story of a shipwrecked family, who were fifteen months on an island with a murderer: there <b>is</b> a specimen. <b>The</b> Pacific <b>is</b> a strange place; the nineteenth century only exists there in spots: all round, it is a no man's land of the ages, a stir-about of epochs and races, barbarisms and civilisations, virtues and crimes.|$|R
