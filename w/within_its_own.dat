5|$|Kraków {{is divided}} into 18 {{administrative}} districts (dzielnica) or boroughs, each {{with a degree of}} autonomy <b>within</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> municipal government. Prior to March 1991, the city had been divided into four quarters which still give a sense of identity to Kraków – the towns of Podgórze, Nowa Huta, and Krowodrza which were amalgamated into the city of Kraków as it expanded, and the ancient town centre of Kraków itself.|$|E
5|$|T. ludovicianus is {{traditionally}} placed <b>within</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> genus as its only representative of North America, but recent DNA work suggests it is closely {{allied with the}} Bewick's wren. A distinct population in the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico, Belize, Nicaragua, and in Guatemala is treated as a separate species, either known as Cabot's wren or white-browed wren (Thryothorus albinucha). It is considered a subspecies of T. ludovicianus by some authors, however.|$|E

5|$|By 1798 the British Royal Navy had {{successfully}} contained the French Navy <b>within</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> harbours, employing {{a strategy of}} close blockade to ensure dominance at sea during the French Revolutionary Wars. The strategy was particularly effective in the English Channel, where the proximity of British bases and the importance in limiting {{the movements of the}} French invasion forces stationed around Boulogne focused British attention on the Normandy coast. This was essential to prevent the concentration of a large force of invasion barges that had been constructed at various harbours under the guidance of a Captain Muskein. To improve the Royal Navy's ability to observe French movements on the Normandy coast, a force under the command of Captain Sir Sidney Smith seized, garrisoned, and fortified the uninhabited Îles Saint-Marcouf in 1795.|$|E
5|$|Prehistoric Polynesian {{habitation}} on Nihoa {{may have}} initially {{led to a}} decrease in the plant population of A. brownii. Major threats to the plant include invasive species, fire, and hybridization with other Amaranthus species. Inbreeding is a serious threat, as the small plant population must reproduce <b>within</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> circle resulting in genetic defects. A. brownii is also forced to compete with the non-native weed (Portulaca oleracea), the plant's main alien species threat. In 2002 and 2004, the invasive gray bird grasshopper (Schistocerca nitens) presented an even larger threat to A. brownii. First recorded on the island in 1977, the increasing population density of gray bird grasshoppers led to massive defoliation on the island, leaving A. brownii at greater risk of predation. In 2004 alone, an estimated 400,000 gray bird grasshoppers destroyed almost 90% of the vegetation on Nihoa.|$|E
5|$|The fossa was {{formally}} described by Edward Turner Bennett {{on the basis}} of a specimen from Madagascar sent by Charles Telfair in 1833. The common name is the same as the generic name of the Malagasy civet (Fossa fossana), but they are different species. Because of shared physical traits with civets, mongooses, and cats (Felidae), its classification has been controversial. Bennett originally placed the fossa as a type of civet in the family Viverridae, a classification that long remained popular among taxonomists. Its compact braincase, large eye sockets, retractable claws, and specialized carnivorous dentition have also led some taxonomists to associate it with the felids. In 1939, William King Gregory and Milo Hellman placed the fossa in its own subfamily within Felidae, the Cryptoproctinae. George Gaylord Simpson placed it back in Viverridae in 1945, still <b>within</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> subfamily, yet conceded it had many cat-like characteristics.|$|E

60|$|By this I {{mean that}} each {{community}} has, <b>within</b> limits, <b>its</b> <b>own</b> particular {{ways of being}} funny and <b>its</b> <b>own</b> particular conception of a joke. Thus, a Scotchman likes best a joke which he has all to himself or which he shares reluctantly with a few; the thing is too rich to distribute. The American loves particularly as his line of joke an anecdote with the point all concentrated {{at the end and}} exploding in a phrase. The Englishman loves best as his joke the narration of something that actually did happen and that depends, of course; for its point on its reality.|$|R
5|$|The {{political}} independence and {{sovereignty of the}} Malagasy armed forces, which comprises an army, navy and air force, was restored with independence from France in 1960. Since this time the Malagasy military has never engaged in armed conflict with another state or <b>within</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> borders, but has occasionally intervened to restore order during periods of political unrest. Under the socialist Second Republic, Admiral Didier Ratsiraka instated mandatory national armed or civil service for all young citizens regardless of gender, a policy that remained in effect from 1976 to 1991. The armed forces are {{under the direction of}} the Minister of the Interior and have remained largely neutral during times of political crisis, as during the protracted standoff between incumbent Ratsiraka and challenger Marc Ravalomanana in the disputed 2001 presidential elections, when the military refused to intervene in favor of either candidate. This tradition was broken in 2009, when a segment of the army defected to the side of Andry Rajoelina, then-mayor of Antananarivo, in support of his attempt to force President Ravalomanana from power.|$|E

Under normal conditions, there was little need for interregional travel, as each regional group had access to enough resources <b>within</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> territory to be completely self-sufficient. However, fluctuations in animal populations or weather conditions sometimes necessitated travel and trade between regions.|$|E

25|$|The {{definition}} of scope was introduced {{early in the}} development of Logical Form scholarship. The scope of an operator is the domain within which it has the ability to affect the interpretation of other expressions. In other words, an operator has scope of operation, or affecting the interpretation of other phrases, only <b>within</b> <b>its</b> <b>own</b> domain. Three uncontroversial examples of scope affecting some aspect of the interpretation are: quantifier-quantifier, quantifier-pronoun, quantifier-negative polarity item.|$|E

500|$|To {{accompany}} the songbook of Blonde on Blonde, Paul Nelson wrote an introduction stating, [...] "The very title suggests the singularity and the duality we expect from Dylan.

Dylan in the end truly UNDERSTANDS situations, and once one truly understands anything, there {{can no longer be}} anger, no longer be moralizing, but only humor and compassion, only pity." ...|$|R
50|$|Universes {{in films}} (or television) mostly {{consist of a}} {{franchise}} featuring an umbrella of multiple franchises (film or television) set within the same continuity, each franchise <b>within</b> telling <b>its</b> <b>own</b> stand-alone story focusing on a different character (or group of characters), as well as featuring <b>its</b> <b>own</b> cast, of directors, writers, while also {{being part of a}} coherent, non-contradictory continuity shared with the other works.

Universes with major presence in films and television, generally are refereed as cinematic universes as that's the medium that reaches the most audiences.

25|$|When a great {{river is}} the {{boundary}} between two nations or states, if the original property is in neither, and there be no convention respecting it, each holds {{to the middle of}} the stream.

50|$|Instead {{of labor}} being divided up <b>within</b> members of <b>its</b> <b>own</b> species, P. sulcifer gives {{most of its}} labor to its host species. P. sulcifer is a {{permanently}} workerless species, and cannot take care of <b>its</b> <b>own</b> brood, and so relies on P. dominula workers {{to do this for}} them. This work involves building up the nest, foraging, and feeding the young. Because P. sulcifer consists only of reproductive males and females, the fertile reproductive female's main job is to successfully usurp a nest in order to raise her brood, while the reproductive male's primary job is to fertilize the reproductive females.|$|R
