5|$|Herbal medicines, as a whole, {{are poorly}} {{supported}} by evidence. The herbal treatments Devil's claw and <b>white</b> <b>willow</b> {{may reduce the}} number of individuals reporting high levels of pain; however, for those taking pain relievers, this difference is not significant. Capsicum, in the form of either a gel or a plaster cast, has been found to reduce pain and increase function.|$|E
5|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the park}} includes many communities of a Mediterranean and sub-Mediterranean type: warm oak forests with undergrowth of evergreen sclerophyll shrubs, such as tree heath (Erica arborea), butcher's-broom (Ruscus aculeatus), Rose of Sharon (Hypericum calycinum), green olive tree (Phillyrea latifolia), Cistus incanus, sage-leaved rock rose (Cistus salvifolius), among others. The xerothermic grasslands along the coast and in some areas to the west {{of the park}} have replaced forests destroyed by human activity. The most widespread floral communities of that type are dominated by Chrysopogon gryllus, Bothriochloa ischaemum and bulbous bluegrass (Poa bulbosa). The coastal dunes are home to psammophytic vegetation. The river banks are covered with dense forests of black alder (Alnus glutinosa), <b>white</b> <b>willow</b> (Salix alba) and crack willow (Salix fragilis).|$|E
5|$|The Tale of Mr. Tod {{is longer}} than the typical Potter tale with 16 colour {{illustrations}} {{and a series of}} 42 black and white drawings, one illustration per page. The illustrations depict the wider landscape of Near Sawrey: Bull Banks, Oatmeal Crag, and Esthwaite Water. The interior of Mr. Tod's house provided the opportunity to present details of the interiors of village homes. In the frontispiece, Mr. Tod stands on a stone flag floor against a timber wall of muntin and plank construction (interlocking thick and thin vertical panels) covered with a sage-green limewash. A tea caddy, a silver salt, and blue and <b>white</b> <b>willow</b> china decorate his kitchen. The beehive-shaped brick oven was drawn from the one at the Sun Inn in Hawkshead and serves as a place for Brock to hide the bunnies. Emphatic frames in the black and white illustrations give the impression of woodcuts. Potter believed a black frame pulled a picture together and sent back the distance. Potter made the kitchen dim to eliminate some detail of the battle between Tod and Brock.|$|E
50|$|There {{are around}} 30 {{different}} species of trees in the park including Oak, Horse Chestnut, Sycamore {{and some of the}} best collections of willows in Lambeth, including goat <b>willows,</b> <b>white</b> <b>willows,</b> grey willows and osiers.|$|R

25|$|The bat {{is made of}} wood, usually salix alba (<b>white</b> <b>willow),</b> and has {{the shape}} of a blade topped by a {{cylindrical}} handle. The blade must not be more than four and one quarter inches wide and the total length of the bat not more than 38 inches.

25|$|The active extract of the bark, called salicin, {{after the}} Latin {{name for the}} <b>white</b> <b>willow</b> (Salix alba), was {{isolated}} and named by the German chemist Johann Andreas Buchner in 1828. A larger amount of the substance was isolated in 1829 by Henri Leroux, a French pharmacist. Raffaele Piria, an Italian chemist, was able to convert the substance into a sugar and a second component, which on oxidation becomes salicylic acid.|$|E

25|$|Many {{types of}} sports {{equipment}} {{are made of}} wood, or were constructed of wood in the past. For example, cricket bats are typically made of <b>white</b> <b>willow.</b> The baseball bats which are legal for use in Major League Baseball are frequently made of ash wood or hickory, {{and in recent years}} have been constructed from maple even though that wood is somewhat more fragile. NBA courts have been traditionally made out of parquetry.|$|E

2500|$|The site {{consists}} {{of a series of}} temperate zone forested and non-forested bogs that provide a variety of habitats for birds, mammals, fish and plants.

50|$|<b>White</b> <b>willows</b> are fast-growing, but {{relatively}} short-lived, being susceptible to several diseases, including watermark disease {{caused by the}} bacterium Brenneria salicis (named because of the characteristic 'watermark' staining in the wood; syn. Erwinia salicis) and willow anthracnose, caused by the fungus Marssonina salicicola. These diseases can be a serious problem on trees grown for timber or ornament.|$|R

Growing at the University of Stuttgart is a three-storey tower of living <b>white</b> <b>willows</b> (Salix alba). This nine-meter-tall construction is almost fully grown, with a base area of around eight square meters.|$|R

Varro gives {{either the}} myth of the killing of Argos as an {{etymology}} of the word Argi-letum (death of Argos), which looks to be purely fantastic, or that of place located upon a soil of clay, argilla in Latin. The place so named stood {{at the foot of the}} Viminal, the hill of the reeds. It could also be referred to the <b>white</b> <b>willow</b> tree, used to make objects of trelliswork.|$|E
2500|$|The {{blade of}} a cricket bat is a wooden block that is {{generally}} {{flat on the}} striking face and with a ridge on the reverse (back) which concentrates wood in the middle where the ball is generally hit. [...] The bat is traditionally made from willow wood, specifically {{from a variety of}} <b>White</b> <b>Willow</b> called Cricket Bat Willow (Salix alba var. caerulea), treated with raw (unboiled) linseed oil, which has a protective function. This variety of willow is used as it is very tough and shock-resistant, not being significantly dented nor splintering on the impact of a cricket ball at high speed, while also being light in weight. The face of the bat is often covered with a protective film by the user.|$|E
5000|$|<b>White</b> <b>Willow's</b> {{influences}} {{range from}} 10cc, The Beach Boys, Big Star and Steely Dan to King Crimson, Magma, Weather Report and even Nick Drake and Joni Mitchell. They have been hailed by The Billboard Guide to Progressive Music as [...] "one {{of the most}} significant progressive groups of the current era". Typical of their sound is the prominence of female vocals, flute and mellotrons and analog synthesizers.|$|R

2500|$|Salem Willows is an oceanfront {{neighborhood}} and amusement park. It {{is named for}} the European <b>white</b> <b>willow</b> trees planted there in 1801 to form a shaded walk for patients convalescing at a nearby smallpox hospital. The area became a public park in 1858, and {{in the twentieth century}} became a summer destination for residents of Boston's North Shore, many of whom escaped the heat of the city on newly popular streetcars. [...] The beaches are also a common place to watch the 4th of July fireworks since you can see three sets of fireworks; Salem, Beverly, and Marblehead. The Willows also has a famous popcorn stand, Hobbs, which is known around the North Shore {{as one of the best}} places to get popcorn and ice cream.|$|E

60|$|The young ship-builder {{who understands}} his trade, {{when he is}} about to put a vessel on the stocks--to speak technically--first makes up his mind whether {{it is to be a}} ship, a schooner, a sloop, or merely a sail-boat, and determines its size. Then he selects a good piece of solid, but light wood, which will be large enough for the hull. Pine is {{generally}} used; but if he can get a piece of well-seasoned <b>white</b> <b>willow,</b> he will find it to work very easily. Then he shapes his hull with knife and saw, according to the best of his ability. On this process the success of the whole undertaking depends. If the bottom is not cut perfectly true on both sides, if the bow is not shapely and even, if the stern is not rounded off and cut up in the orthodox fashion, his ship will never sail well, no matter how admirably he may execute the rest of his work. If there is a ship or boat builder's establishment anywhere within reasonable walking distance, it will well pay our young shipwright to go there, and study the forms of hulls. Even if he should never build a ship, he ought to know how they look out of the water.|$|E

The quality of thick poppy juice is measured worldwide by morphine units; while Chinese opium contains eight such units and {{is considered to be}} of high quality, Indian opium contains seven units, and Turkish opium only six, Macedonian opium contains a full 14 morphine units {{and is one of the}} best quality opiums in the world.|$|R
