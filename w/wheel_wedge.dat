50|$|Million Dollar Wedge - Introduced in the 2008 revival, {{the space}} {{contained}} a $1,000,000 space surrounded by two small Bankrupts. If a player landed on and acquired it, solved that puzzle, did not hit any Bankrupts {{for the remainder}} of the game, and subsequently won the game, a $1,000,000 prize wedge would be added to the bonus round <b>wheel.</b> This <b>wedge</b> was adopted in the United States in September 2008.|$|R

40|$|Background: In {{cities with}} trams as public transportation, tram tracks are often on public roads, {{creating}} a shared road situation with other road participants like cyclists. Beside {{the risk of}} direct collisions, this situation {{can also lead to}} bicycle <b>wheels</b> getting <b>wedged</b> in tram tracks, causing cyclists to fall. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} gain more insight in the injury pattern of this trauma mechanism and to draw attention to the risks of the infrastructural situation with on-road tram tracks. Patients and Methods: A one-year, prospective, observational cohort study was conducted. All patients admitted after presentation to the emergency department of a level 1 trauma center, who got injured because their bicycle <b>wheels</b> got <b>wedged</b> in tram tracks, were included. Data were collected on patient demographics, type of injury and treatment. Results: Ten patients were included. Six were male. The mean age was 38 years. Six patients required surgery, mostly because of extremity injuries. Mean duration of admission was 4 days. Mean injury severity score was 13. One patient died as a result of the injuries sustained in the accident. Conclusions: Tram tracks on public roads are potentially dangerous and can lead to serious injuries and even mortality amongst cyclist. Operative intervention is frequently needed...|$|R
50|$|From {{the time}} of Archimedes through the Renaissance, {{mechanisms}} {{were considered to be}} constructed from simple machines, such as the lever, pulley, screw, <b>wheel</b> and axle, <b>wedge</b> and inclined plane. It was Reuleaux who focussed on bodies, called links, and the connections between these bodies called kinematic pairs, or joints.|$|R
500|$|When Griffin {{pitched the}} idea for the show to Lin Bolen, then the head of NBC's daytime {{programming}} division, she approved, but wanted the show to have more glamour to attract the female audience. She suggested that Griffin incorporate a shopping element into the gameplay, and so, in 1973, he created a pilot episode titled Shopper's Bazaar, with Chuck Woolery as host and Mike Lawrence as announcer. The pilot started with the three contestants being introduced individually, with Lawrence describing the prizes that they chose to play for. The main game was played to four rounds, with the values on the <b>wheel</b> <b>wedges</b> increasing after the second round. Unlike the show it evolved into, Shopper's Bazaar had a vertically mounted wheel, which was spun by Woolery rather than by the contestants. This wheel lacked the Bankrupt wedge and featured a wedge where a contestant could call a vowel for free, as well as a [...] "Your Own Clue" [...] wedge that allowed contestants to pick up a rotary telephone and hear a private clue about the puzzle. At the end of the game, the highest-scoring contestant would play a bonus round called the [...] "Shopper's Special" [...] where all the vowels in the puzzle were already there, and the contestant had 30 seconds to call out consonants in the puzzle.|$|R
50|$|The multi-colored <b>wheel</b> had 22 <b>wedges</b> (each with 4 pegs) {{instead of}} the 24 wedges of the American show, and value amounts {{originally}} ranged from 100 to 1,500 kroner (2,500 in later rounds) {{to be used for}} shopping purposes.

The modern approach to characterizing machines focusses on the components that allow movement, known as joints.|$|R
50|$|During {{each round}} the <b>wheel</b> {{displays}} six <b>wedges</b> that can each be red, green, or gold; initially {{they are all}} red or green. A correct answer changes one red wedge to green, or {{if there are no}} red wedges, changes one green wedge to gold. A wrong answer changes a green wedge to red, or if all the wedges were already red, eliminates the player.|$|R
50|$|The {{champion}} {{was shown}} a special wheel-within-a-wheel setup (similar to the Melody Roulette wheel on Name That Tune). The inner wheel contained {{two sets of}} dollar wedges (worth $25, $50, $75, and $100) while the outer <b>wheel</b> contained two <b>wedges</b> each {{of the names of}} two grand prizes. The champion spun the wheels to determine the dollar amount of each question and which grand prize they would play for.|$|R

It proposes some guidelines to create a unit of study for six simple machines that include the fulcrum, inclined plane, pulley, <b>wheel</b> and axle, <b>wedge,</b> and screw.

50|$|Every vehicle {{function}} that changes direction or speed relies on {{friction between the}} tires and the road surface. The grooves of a rubber tire are designed to disperse water from beneath the tire, providing high friction even in wet conditions. Aquaplaning occurs when a tire encounters more water than it can dissipate. Water pressure {{in front of the}} <b>wheel</b> forces a <b>wedge</b> of water under {{the leading edge of the}} tire, causing it to lift from the road. The tire then skates on a sheet of water with little, if any, direct road contact, and loss of control results. If multiple tires aquaplane, the vehicle may lose directional control and slide until it either collides with an obstacle, or slows enough that one or more tires contact the road again and friction is regained.|$|R
5000|$|In 1515, John {{took the}} guns off two warships, the James and Margaret, at Dumbarton, {{which had been}} {{returned}} from France by the Duke of Albany, and took the cannon to Edinburgh overland via Glasgow. John was often based at Edinburgh Castle where carpenters and ironworkers maintained the royal artillery. He directed the transport of these heavy guns. Drummond also had an armoury in a building at the gate of Holyroodhouse rented from the priest of St. Leonards. [...] On 8 August 1536, John delivered guns to George Stirling of Glorat at Dumbarton Castle. These included four great guns furnished with stocks, <b>wheels,</b> vices and <b>wedges,</b> six falcons with stocks and wheels, 33 hagbutts, four iron culverins, bullets, gunpowder and ramrods. John took away a 10 foot long brass gun barrel.|$|R
40|$|Listeria monocytogenes {{contamination}} in Ricotta salata cheese rind {{is a common}} finding. In the last year numerous cases of food alert and even of human listeriosis associated with the consume of Ricotta salata {{have been reported in}} different Member States of the European Union and other countries. The presence of L. monocytogenes in the cheese making plant environment represent an important risk factor in the contamination of ricotta salata (i. e. post-proces contamination). L. monocytogenes is mainly localized on the rind of the product. The reduction of the risk associated with environmental contamination can be obtained through the application of post-lethality treatment. The feasibility to inactivate L. monocytogenes using water bath heat-treatment under experimental conditions has already been demonstrated by Spanu et al., (2013). The aim of this work was to optimize a water bath heat treatment, which can be used at industrial level, allowing the control of L. monocytogenes post-process {{contamination in}} Ricotta salata <b>wheels</b> and <b>wedges.</b> For each type of product was tested the efficacy of 9 time-temperature combinations on samples artificially inoculated with L. monocytogenes. On the test units were conducted microbiological, physic-chemical and sensorial analysis. The best time-temperature combination would selected taking into account the inactivation level of L. monocytogenes (the target was set at 5 -log reduction), the economic sustainability of the treatment and the influence on sensory properties of the product...|$|R
50|$|Cadence braking (or {{any other}} type of braking) will not help much on {{extremely}} slippery surfaces such as ice (in theory it would, but in practice the ice can be so slippery that it makes little difference—a winter tyre would make more difference). Also, on very loose surfaces, a quicker stop can be achieved by simply locking the <b>wheels,</b> causing a <b>wedge</b> of loose material to build up ahead of the wheels and create a substantial braking force. This is useful only when stopping in a straight line, because locking the wheels means all steering control would be lost. In such conditions, ABS actually increases the stopping distances. On poor surfaces, in the past, rally drivers timed the pulsing of brake application so as {{to take advantage of the}} load transfer as the vehicle pitches forwards and backwards in response to the initial braking effort. With modern, over-dampened, and stiffly sprung suspensions this is less likely to be effective.|$|R
40|$|Seismic tomographic {{images of}} {{subduction}} zones {{are characterized by}} strong positive and negative anomalies in the wedge above the slab. We have developed a 2 -D thermo-chemical numerical model to simulate the dynamics of such anomalies during subduction. By using an internal consistent petrological-thermomechanical approach we investigate heat, water and melt transport in a subduction zone including the propagation of partially molten upwellings (cold plumes) originating from the subducting slab. The model demonstrates two chemically distinct types of plumes (mixed and unmixed), and various rigid body rotation phenomena in the <b>wedge</b> (subduction <b>wheel,</b> fore-arc spin, <b>wedge</b> pin-ball). These thermal-chemical features strongly perturb seismic structure, {{and the results are}} comparable with seismic tomographic images of subduction zone. For example, high Qp anomalies (P-wave attenuation) have been found below Salar de Atacama basin (Schurr et al, 2003), and seismic properties suggest a relatively cold and rigid block sank in lighter material. Inferring from our results we can explain these anomalies as subduction “wheel ” phenomenon: a fragment of dry mantle wedge surrounded by hydrated partially molten rocks. The fragment is trapped between the plume and the subducting slab, and is put into stable rotational motion. This is associated with significant (by 200 - 300 K) lowering of temperature that causes gradual appearance of strong positive seismic velocity anomalies within a rotating body...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} couple of decades, a growing body of {{research}} has provided insights into the complex processes of learning that take place in museums. Interestingly, museum-related learning is not limited to the actual visit: what takes place before and afterwards has a profound effect on the learning outcome. The study presented in this paper focuses on the post-visit aspects of the learning process. Previous research shows that visitors make connections between their experiences in the museum and experiences that happen after the visit. Sometimes these connections can occur weeks or months (or even years) after the visit, depending on when the visitor happens upon a situation that allows the connection to be made. Documenting these events is obviously quite difficult. Even though it is possible to re-establish contact with visitors after a few weeks or months (e. g., through telephone or e-mail), the information obtained is not in situ. The goal of the present study is to attempt to acquire and analyze more data from these in situ situations, and to re-present the data in an exhibition. To this end, we have designed a system that allows visitors to send images and text messages to a central server through e-mail, SMS or MMS. The data from the server can then be visualized as a weblog (blog) or in some other suitable form. We collaborated with the Museum of Science and Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. A large part of the Museum's Science Centre is devoted to five mechanical principles: the screw, the plane slope, the lever, the <b>wheel</b> and the <b>wedge.</b> We have designed an exhibit that utilizes our system to present messages (images and text) from visitors on the subject of the five principles in the science centre itself. It is also possible to access the messages through a public Web page. From the Museum's perspective, our exhibit not only provides new opportunities for documenting post-visit learning processes, but also has the potential to provide new forms of evaluation data that might be difficult to obtain through other means. Furthermore, it allows Museum visitors to extend the original scope of the mechanical principles exhibition by allowing them to provide their own content (and reflections upon the existing content), a re-occurring theme in many recent technology-based exhibits. The paper provides a description of our system, the exhibit we have built, how the exhibit is managed, and how it has worked in practice...|$|R
