40|$|This study compares two {{alternative}} indices for quantifying {{the gross}} pathology of the swimbladder of eels, Anguilla anguilla (L.), {{infected with the}} nematode Anguillicoloides crassus. Two observers recorded twice the scores obtained by the two indices on {{the same set of}} 71 <b>wild</b> <b>caught</b> <b>eels</b> (from elver to silver eels, French Mediterranean lagoons). The Length Ratio Index (LRI), performed better than the Swimbladder Degenerative Index (SDI), in three of four predefined criteria of decision. First, the LRI better correlated with an estimate of the swimbladder volume reduction, a functional consequence of the infection (representativeness). Also, the LRI was less prone to subjectivity (inter-observer variability) and more precise (intra-observer variability), although less easy to generate (time needed for measurement/assessment). Using a sub-sample of 32 unaffected eels (showing minor if any swimbladder damage and no living worms at autopsy), we ascertained a linear relationship between the swimbladder length and the total body length, a prerequisite of isometric growth, to definitively accept the new ratio index as a valid alternative to the SDI. Also, because the LRI can be recorded on live specimens with radio-imagery (non-invasive method), we recommend its use, and provide a graph of correspondence between the SDI scores, the LRI scores and the estimated proportion of gas loss in the swimbladde...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{haematological}} {{techniques to}} assess fish health is generally accepted. The {{aim of the}} current study was to determine selected haematological changes that occur in Clarias gariepinus (Burchell, 1822). infected with trypanosomes. Blood films were prepared according to standard techniques to confirm trypanosome infections and whole blood was collected, the serum and plasma separated, and prepared for albumin and total protein concentration analysis. Plasma albumin levels were significantly higher in infected <b>wild</b> <b>caught</b> fish than in uninfected <b>wild</b> <b>caught</b> fish and uninfected breeding stock. Serum albumin levels were significantly lower in infected <b>wild</b> <b>caught</b> fish when compared to uninfected breeding stock. The total plasma and serum protein levels were within the normal range for C. gariepinus, that is, 3 g – 6 g/ 100 mL. The total plasma protein levels varied significantly between the three groups. However, the total serum protein levels were only significantly different between uninfected breeding stock and uninfected <b>wild</b> <b>caught</b> fish, as well as uninfected breeding stock and infected <b>wild</b> <b>caught</b> fish. The total protein levels were significantly higher in infected <b>wild</b> <b>caught</b> fish than in the other groups, a possible indication of an infection or inflammatory host response...|$|R

40|$|The Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) has {{potential}} for aquaculture with good prices {{in a large}} and growing market and good performance under aquaculture conditions. These characteristics have attracted investment in the species culture during the world economic crisis (2008 - 2014). However, a bottleneck that remains unsolved is that captivity bred G 1 (1 st generation) Senegalese sole exhibit a complete reproductive failure and spawn eggs that are not viable whilst <b>wild</b> <b>caught</b> sole spontaneously spawn {{the quantity and quality}} of eggs required for production. The industry must rely on <b>wild</b> <b>caught</b> fish to supply eggs and this complicates implementing breeding programs that would improve production.

40|$|The {{study of}} rabies virus {{infection}} in bats {{can be challenging}} due to quarantine requirements, husbandry concerns, genetic differences among animals, and lack of medical history. To date, all rabies virus (RABV) studies in bats have been performed in <b>wild</b> <b>caught</b> animals. Determining the RABV exposure history of a <b>wild</b> <b>caught</b> bat based on {{the presence or absence}} of viral neutralizing antibodies (VNA) may be misleading. Previous studies have demonstrated that the presence of VNA following natural or experimental inoculation is often ephemeral. With this knowledge, it is difficult to determine if a seronegative, <b>wild</b> <b>caught</b> bat has been previously exposed to RABV. The influence of prior rabies exposure in healthy, <b>wild</b> <b>caught</b> bats is unknown. To investigate the pathogenesis of RABV infection in bats born in captivity (naïve bats), naïve bats were inoculated intramuscularly with one of two Eptesicus fuscus rabies virus variants, EfV 1 or EfV 2. To determine the host response to a heterologous RABV, a separate group of naïve bats were inoculated with a Lasionycteris noctivagans RABV (LnV 1). Six months following the first inoculation, all bats were challenged with EfV 2. Our results indicate that naïve bats may have some level of innate resistance to intramuscular RABV inoculation. Additionally, naïve bats inoculated with the LnV demonstrated the lowest clinical infection rate of all groups. However, primary inoculation with EfV 1 or LnV did not appear to be protective against a challenge with the more pathogenic EfV 2...|$|R

One of the tasks was to compare the eating quality and shelf life of turbot grown under standard rearing conditions and post slaughter processing conditions and <b>wild</b> <b>caught</b> turbot. In this report the IMARES activities are presented. In same experiment sensory evaluation performed on farmed turbot from Iceland, this is reported in paper Roth: The subsequent effect of pre and post mortem muscle activity on muscle pH, rigor, texture hardness and sensory properties of turbot. Scophthalmus maximus (sensory results not reported in this paper anymore: present in this report to not get lost the data/results). The sensory profile of fresh farmed and wild turbot only differs on texture attributes: The wild turbot being less firm. The sensory spoilage pattern is similar for farmed and wild turbot but developed faster for <b>wild</b> <b>caught</b> turbot. The same can be seen for the Quality Index: Zeelandvis farmed turbot has longest shelf life of at least 18 days, followed by Stolt farmed turbot with 18 days of shelf life. The <b>wild</b> <b>caught</b> turbot in this study had a shelf life of 11 days. The farmed turbot from Zeelandvis stays in rigor mortis for 8 days and remains stiffer thereafter...|$|R
40|$|The immune {{function}} of wild animals has been rather little studied. Wild animals’ {{immune function}} {{may differ from}} that of laboratory bred animals because of their different environments. This idea follows from the concept of resource partitioning in which animals distribute scarce resources to all aspects of life, including to costly immune responses. A logical extension of this idea is {{that there may be}} substantial interindividual variation in the immune function of wild animals. To begin to investigate this, we compared the immune function of a laboratory bred mouse strain (C 57 BL/ 6, a widely used mouse strain that makes potent immune responses) and <b>wild</b> <b>caught</b> Mus musculus. We found that by most measures of immune function, the <b>wild</b> <b>caught</b> mice had greater immune function. Specifically, wild mice had greater concentrations and more avid antigen-specific IgG responses, as well as higher concentrations of total IgG and IgE, compared with those laboratory bred mice. Moreover, flow cytometric analysis showed a comparatively greater overall level of activation of the cells of the immune system in wild mice. Lastly, we observed that immune function was substantially more variable among <b>wild</b> <b>caught</b> mice than among the laboratory bred mice. The next research challenge is to understand which aspects of an individual animal’s life determine its immune function...|$|R
