Why have you told me that I must not go, since if I did not go the truth would become a lie, which it cannot? You say it is fated that I should go and because I go such and such things will come about. And yet you tell me not to go, for that is what you mean. Oh! Kherheb Ki and Bakenkhonsu, doubtless you are great magicians and strong in wisdom, but there are greater than you who rule the world, and there is a wisdom to <b>which</b> <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> but as a drop of water to the Nile. I thank you for your warnings, but to-morrow I go down to the land of Goshen to fulfil the {{commands}} of Pharaoh. If I come back again we will talk more of these matters here upon the earth. If I do not come back, perchance we will talk of them elsewhere. Farewell." ...|$|E

You discard {{me and my}} devotion, to follow a nature, in its way, it is true, greater even than my own, representing the principle of good, as I represent the principle of evil, but one to <b>which</b> <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> utterly abhorrent. Can you mix light with darkness, or filthy oil with water? As well hope to merge your life, black {{as it is with}} every wickedness, with that of the splendid creature you would defile. Do you suppose that a woman such as she will ever be really faithless to her love, even though you trap her into marriage? Fool, her heart is as far above you as the stars; and without a heart a woman is a husk that none but such miserables as yourself would own. But go on--dash yourself against a white purity that will, in the end, blind and destroy you. Dree your own doom! I will find you expedients; it is my business to obey you. You shall marry her, if you will, and taste of the judgment that will follow. Be still, I will bear no more of your insolence to-day." [...] And she swept out of the room, leaving George looking somewhat scared.|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR SIR:--Your {{despatch}} {{of yesterday}} has been received, and it disappoints and distresses me. I have shown it to General McClellan, {{who says he}} will write you to-day. I am not competent to criticize your views, and therefore what I offer is in justification of myself. Of the two, I {{would rather have a}} point on the railroad south of Cumberland Gap than Nashville. First, because it cuts a great artery of the enemy's communication, which Nashville does not; and secondly, because it {{is in the midst of}} loyal people who would rally around it, while Nashville is not. Again, I cannot see why the movement on East Tennessee would not be a diversion in your favor rather than a disadvantage, assuming that a movement toward Nashville is the main object. But my distress is that our friends in East Tennessee are being hanged and driven to despair, and even now, I fear, are thinking of taking rebel arms for the sake of personal protection. In this we lose the most valuable stake we have in the South. My despatch, to <b>which</b> <b>yours</b> <b>is</b> an answer, was sent with the knowledge of Senator Johnson and Representative Maynard of East Tennessee, and they will be upon me to know the answer, which I cannot safely show them. They would despair, possibly resign to go and save their families somehow, or die with them. I do not intend this to be an order in any sense, but merely, as intimated before, to show you the grounds of my anxiety.|$|E

5000|$|According to Malcolm, one of {{the ways}} in which the {{government}} had [...] "failed the Negro" [...] was its unwillingness to enforce the law. He pointed out that the Supreme Court had outlawed segregation, [...] "Whenever you are going after something that <b>is</b> <b>yours,</b> you <b>are</b> within your legal rights to lay claim to it. And anyone who puts forth any effort to deprive you of that <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>yours,</b> <b>is</b> breaking the law is a criminal. And this was pointed out by the Supreme Court decision. It outlawed segregation. Which means a segregationist is breaking the law". But, he said, the police department and local government often sided with segregationists against the Civil Rights Movement.|$|R

Moreover I have many eyes and ears that can see and hear things to <b>which</b> <b>yours</b> <b>are</b> deaf and blind, and I tell you that I think a time will come when I shall {{be able to do}} service to all of you who are of the nest of the Swallow.

You now heap coals of fire, as the phrase is, on my head--and I can scarcely bear it, for the pure crushing sense of your goodness. I was in truth, at the time of your other letter, deeply submerged--at once horribly bereft and very ill physically, but I was really almost as much touched by the kindness of <b>which</b> <b>yours</b> <b>was</b> a part as I was either. Only I was unable to do anything at the time in the way of recognition--at the time or for a long while afterwards; and when at last I did begin to emerge--after a very difficult year in America which came to an end only two months ago, my very indebtednesses were paralysing--my long silence required, to my sore sense, so much explanation. However, I have little by little explained--to some friends; though I think not to those I count as closest--for such, one feels, are the best comprehenders, without one's having to tell too much.|$|R
