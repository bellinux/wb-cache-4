This was soon followed by a paper by Martin David Kruskal and Martin Schwarzschild discussing pinch machines, however, which demonstrated instabilities in those devices were inherent to the design.|$|E
25|$|The A38(M) {{motorway}} (also {{known as}} the Aston Expressway) in Birmingham, England. The road connects the city centre with Spaghetti Junction on the M6. It is a 2-mile, 7-lane section of motorway with no central reservation, and a lower than usual speed limit of 50mph. Constructed in 1971, it was the United Kingdom's first contraflow road. Overhead lane control signals allow for 4 lanes in and 2 {{out in the morning}} rush hour, reversed in the evening, and 3 lanes each <b>way</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> other times. One dividing lane is closed to traffic at all times, and motorcycles are permanently prohibited from using the central, red-surfaced lane (with a fixed sign) owing to its use as an off-camber drain. The lane control signals can be set to allow travel in either direction for any lane in exceptional circumstances, which has been used for single-lane, reduced-speed running in each direction (or 2+1 with no divider) during road work, allowing the expressway to remain largely open even during major repairs. However, the 7-lane section splits at both ends to fully divided sets of 4x2 lane slip roads, with the central red lane ending in a barrier, so full use of this flexibility is uncommon and occasional overnight closure is required.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1984, Double Trouble began {{recording}} {{their second}} studio album, Couldn't Stand the Weather, at the Power Station, with John Hammond as executive producer and engineer Richard Mullen. Layton later recalled working with Hammond: [...] "He {{was kind of}} like a nice hand on your shoulder, as opposed to someone that jumped in and said, 'Let's redo this, let's do that more.' He didn't get involved in that <b>way</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> He was a feedback person." [...] As the sessions began, Vaughan's cover of Bob Geddins' [...] "Tin Pan Alley" [...] was recorded while audio levels were being checked. Layton remembers the performance: [...] "...we did probably the quietest version we ever did up 'til that point. We ended it and [...] said, 'That's the best that song will ever sound,' and we went, 'We haven't even got sounds, have we?' He goes, 'That doesn't matter. That's the best you'll ever do that song.' We tried it again five, six, seven times—I can't even remember. But it never quite sounded like it did that first time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Individually, {{the members}} of Organization XIII have {{received}} varied receptions. Jeff Haynes of IGN felt that Roxas was a [...] "likable kid", and Ron Fahey of Eurogamer concurred, calling him a [...] "likeable enough young chap who {{just happens to be}} troubled by memories and visions of people he doesn't even know". His playable involvement in the game was regarded as a transitional arc, being used to introduce the gameplay to players that are new to the franchise. Fahey also considered it a good introduction, as it lets the player become familiar with the basic elements in a manner that [...] "isn't a bad <b>way</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> of setting the scene for the game". However, Reiner emphasizes his role as a [...] "troubled boy", calling his story arc [...] "an amazing chain of events", particularly noting that the revelation of his nature as a Nobody creates a [...] "devilish yet remarkable plot twist" [...] which may impact the player in a way that he [...] "may not want Sora back". The introduction of Xion in trailers for Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, created expectation, particularly based on the facts that her face could not be distinguished and that she wields a keyblade. In the 2009 Nintendo Power Awards, the magazine's readers voted Xion the [...] "Best New Character" [...] of the year.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked by}} The Advocate in a February 12, 2009 {{interview}} about viewer concern among the LGBT community that Reese would leave Bianca for Zach and likely has romantic feelings for him, All My Children executive producer Julie Hanan Carruthers responded, [...] "First of all, it’s not true. I think what’s confused in Reese’s head is she has misinterpreted a friendship. Zach {{is one of}} the [...] people who have not kicked her to the curb, so to speak, in Pine Valley." [...] Carruthers said that Reese is a confused and insecure person. [...] "She has never wavered in her commitment to Bianca," [...] she said. [...] "It’s solid, Reese has just had a lot of emotional stuff hit. Her family is rejecting and judging her... in both her family and Bianca’s." [...] In specific response to viewers being upset at the appearance that Reese was considering leaving Bianca for Zach, Carruthers stated, [...] "She is not considering it. That’s the audience rewriting what’s there. It’s not being written that <b>way</b> <b>at</b> <b>all.</b> Reese has never wavered in what she wants." [...] Carruthers acknowledged that Reese leaving Bianca for a man would upset viewers, but that [...] "it's never been about that". [...] "I don’t know how to stress this more," [...] she said. [...] "Never has she played a moment of, 'I want Zach more than I want Bianca,' or 'I would leave Bianca for Zach.' He has literally just been a friend. Look, we tantalize in this genre. We do it whether we do it with heterosexual or homosexual couples. It’s what the genre is." ...|$|E

2500|$|Later that day, Bethmann Hollweg sent {{a message}} to the German {{ambassador}} to Vienna increasing pressure to accept the halt-in-Belgrade proposal, saying that: [...] "If Vienna... refuses... to give <b>way</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> it will hardly be possible to place the blame on Russia for the outbreak of the European conflagration. H.M. has, on the request of the Tsar, undertaken to intervene in Vienna because he could not refuse without awakening an irrefutable suspicion that we wanted war... If these efforts of Britain's meet with success, while Vienna refuses everything, Vienna will prove that it is set on having a war, into which we are dragged, while Russia remains free of guilt. This puts us in a quite impossible position in the eyes of our own people. We can therefore only urgently recommend Vienna to accept Grey's proposal, which safeguards its position in every way." [...] Bethmann Hollweg could not go to war in support of Austrian intransigence under such circumstances. But shortly afterwards, [...] "as soon as news of Russia's general mobilization began to arrive in Berlin" [...] the Chancellor instructed the ambassador in Vienna [...] "that all mediation attempts be stopped", and the directive be suspended. Fritz Fischer and some other scholars have maintained the alternative view that Prince Henry's assurances that King George had promised him that Britain would remain neutral accounted for the change. Fischer notes the telegram reporting these [...] "vague" [...] assurances arrived 12 minutes before the dispatch of the suspending telegram and that Bethmann Hollweg himself justified the cancellation that way, while acknowledging that before then Bethmann Hollweg had already prepared, but not yet sent, a telegram to Vienna explaining that he had [...] "cancelled execution of instructions in No. 200, because the General Staff has just informed me that military measures of our neighbors, especially in the east, compel speedy decision if we are not to be taken by surprise".|$|E

This report presents the European Framework for Digitally-Competent Educational Organisations (DigCompOrg). This framework can facilitate transparency and comparability between related initiatives throughout Europe and play a role in addressing fragmentation and uneven development across the Member States. The primary purposes of DigCompOrg framework are (i) to encourage self-reflection and self-assessment within educational organisations as they progressively deepen their engagement with digital learning and pedagogies (ii) to enable policy makers to design, implement and evaluate policy interventions for the integration and effective use of digital learning technologies.

40|$|From the outset, it is {{important}} to note that the ideas expressed in this address emerge from a confluence of three important works. That is, the basics notions described below flow from, and build upon, three original works: Thompson (2002) Dollaghan (2007) Man-Son-Hing, et al. (2002) The integration of these works leads naturally to evidence-based practice and, most importantly for our purposes, clinical research for informing clinical practice. We begin then with a brief review of our understandings of evidence-based practice (EBP) and then move to a series of possible future states in which clinical research informs clinical practice in meaningful <b>ways.</b> <b>At</b> <b>all</b> points, the premise is that practitioners and researchers mutually benefit and the realized values accrue to the well-being of individuals with communication disorders.
