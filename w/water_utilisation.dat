KWDT-2 has not deliberated how the ever increasing ground water use is diminishing the inflows {{in the river}} and the river water quality. The water allocation by KWDT-1 itself is 83% of 2578 TMC total water availability. During the decade/years 1998-2007, 510 TMC on an average per year was discharged into sea after utilising 1892 TMC out of 2402 TMC annual average yield (page 303 of KWDT-2) in the river which is only 21% of total yield. Already the multi year average TDS of Krishna water is around 450 mg/l which is close to safe maximum of 500 ppm. The actual average water availability in the decade (years 1998 to 2007) is less by 176 TMC to the 2578 TMC estimated average water availability by KWDT-2. If full <b>water</b> <b>utilisation</b> as permitted by KWDT-1 to the extent of 2130 TMC is achieved in future, the usage would be 88.67% of 2402 TMC water availability which would increase the water salinity to unacceptable level. Thus there is no additional water available in the river for further allocation to the riparian states by KWDT-2 in excess of 2130 TMC on average permitted by KWDT-1. In fact, the KWDT-1 water use allocations are already in excess of the sustainable water use from the river when moderate environmental flow requirements are to be taken care.|$|E

The latter three of these six are specific to the non-equilibrium hydrological conditions found in such river basins. These conditions arise because groundwater resources are absent due to basement parent rock, and because a highly dynamic climate, which exogenously supplies the river basin, opens and closes the river basin in wet and dry years respectively. For both proportional and core water allocation, steps can be identified that promote these in ways which are cost efficient, transparent and less resilient to subversion...|$|R

40|$|Several {{hydrological}} studies forecast {{a global}} problem of water scarcity. This raises {{the question as to}} whether increasing water scarcity may impose constraints on the growth of countries. The influence of <b>water</b> <b>utilisation</b> on economic growth is depicted through a growth model that includes this congestible nonexcludable good as a productive input for private producers. Growth is negatively affected by the government’s appropriation of output to supply water but positively influenced by the contribution of increased water use to capital pro-ductivity, leading to an inverted-U relationship between economic growth and the rate of <b>water</b> <b>utilisation.</b> Cross-country estimations confirm this relationship and suggest that for most economies current rates of fresh <b>water</b> <b>utilisation</b> are not yet constraining growth. However, for a handful of countries, moderate or extreme water scarcity may adversely affect economic growth. Nevertheless, even for water-scarce countries, there appears to be little evidence that there are severe diminishing returns to allocating more output to provide water, thus resulting in falling income per capita. These results suggest caution over the claims of some hydrological-based studies of a widespread global ‘water crisis’. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} property rights in managing water demands from a catchment or basin perspective by focusing on defined property rights dimensions. The research resulted from the realisation that water demands are escalating increasingly in various river basins {{as a result of}} the improved living standards, population growth, industrial expansion and increase in agricultural activities, such as irrigation, while water resources availability continue to dwindle. While research efforts have indeed advanced in water demand management, most of this study places its focus on residential or domestic water demands and economic instruments such as pricing. Efforts to study the response of water users to property rights institutions in <b>water</b> resource <b>utilisation</b> have been insignificant. The foremost argument being presented in this study is that resource users do respond to incentives, and those incentives are influenced by the presence of a property rights structure. In addition, there has been overwhelming research in the field of property rights in natural resource and land use, which has been found to be vital in controlling and managing the utilisation of these resources. Using the property rights theory, the thesis has investigated the existence of relationships between attributes of property rights and intentions of water users to conserve water, invest in the improvement of the water resource infrastructure, and protect the water resource. The study employed a case study approach in the Umgeni River catchment Area in the KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa. A survey questionnaire was administered among 146 water users in the catchment who comprised irrigation farmers, livestock farmers and commercial water users, and some interviews were conducted with officials from the Department of Water Affairs. The collected data were analysed using the IBM SPSS software, where descriptive and inferential statistics were utilised to draw some significant relationships. The evidence obtained in this study indicates that property rights would be highly significant in curtailing water demands in a catchment by acting as incentives in <b>water</b> resource <b>utilisation,</b> specifically by first motivating water users to conserve water. In addition, the results revealed significant relationships between property rights attributes duration, enforcement and transferability with the intentions of water users investing in the improvement of water resource infrastructure on their properties. From this study, it was evident that water users would be very motivated to protect the water resource that they use if they have strong enforcement mechanisms for their property right. These results would be hugely significant in the management of water demands as the design of property rights would be used as incentives in order to curtail water demands, especially in a basin context...|$|R

The complex interactions of water scarcity associated with climate change and variability in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and population pressure require innovative strategies to address food insecurity and undernourishment. Current research efforts have identified NUCS as having potential to reduce food and nutrition insecurity, particularly for resource poor households in SSA. This is because of their adaptability to low input agricultural systems and nutritional composition. However, what is required to promote NUCS is scientific research including agronomy, breeding, post-harvest handling and value addition, and linking farmers to markets.

40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScThe {{increasing}} demand for water {{to provide for}} South Africa's growing population has resulted in increasing pressure being placed on the country's limited water resources. Water developments however cannot be undertaken without considering the water resource base and the key policy frameworks that governs its use and protection. The Department of Water Affairs and Forestry as the custodian of water resources in the country initiated {{the implementation of the}} National Water Act during 1999. It has therefore the mandate to ensure that the protection, use, development, conservation, management and control of water resources be achieved in an equitable, efficient and sustainable manner, to the benefit of society at large. The National Water Act prescribes that the Minister of the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry develop a system for the classification of all significant water resources to ensure its protection and sustainable utilisation. The classification system is to be used to determine the class and resource quality objectives of all significant water resources. In the absence of a formal classification system, a framework was developed through this research study in order to guide both the development of a classification system and the implementation, hence ensuring an overarching structure within which intergrated water resource management can be achieved. The main goal of this framework was to seek an appropriate balance between protecting significant water resources {{and at the same time}} promoting <b>water</b> resource <b>utilisation</b> in support of socio-economic development.

While the primary purpose South Africa’s dams is to supply water for domestic and agricultural use, there has been an increasing realisation that their fish populations could make a contribution to food security through the establishment of capture fisheries. Historically, the fish in most South African dams have primarily been utilised for recreational fishing purposes, as subsistence use was criminalised by the apartheid regime in all waters except in the former homeland areas. This legacy persists as many of South Africa’s rural communities do not have a fishing tradition and {{there is a lack of}} an institutional framework to facilitate managed and sustainable access to the fish resource in inland <b>waters.</b> Current <b>utilisation</b> of many inland dams is often complicated by the existence of multiple authorities and interest groups, often with competing agendas.
