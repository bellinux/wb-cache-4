5|$|Nicks {{writes that}} Manning would travel back to Washington, D.C., for visits. An ex-boyfriend helped her {{find her way}} around the city's gay community, {{introducing}} her to lobbyists, activists, and <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>aides.</b> Back at Fort Drum, she continued to display emotional problems and, by August 2009, had been referred to an Army mental-health counselor. A friend told Nicks that Manning could be emotionally fraught, describing an evening they had watched two movies together—The Last King of Scotland and Dancer in the Dark—after which Manning cried for hours. By September 2009 her relationship with Watkins was in trouble; they reconciled for a short time, but it was effectively over.|$|E
5|$|On June 2, 1956, the Republican National Committee {{announced}} that Chotiner {{would have no}} role in the upcoming campaign. On June 6, a House subcommittee disclosed that the California attorney had written to President Eisenhower asking the President to intercede on behalf of Stanley Weiss's low-cost charter line North American Airlines (NAA) before the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). The attorney admitted inquiring of <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>aides</b> concerning the case, but denied using any influence on behalf of any client. White House officials said that they had done no more than ask the CAB when a decision might be expected in NAA's case, and that NAA had lost before the CAB anyway.|$|E

In 1971, after a dispute with <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>aides,</b> Schorr's friends, neighbors, and co-workers were questioned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about his habits. They were told that Schorr was under consideration for a high-level position in the environmental area. Schorr knew nothing about it. Later, during the Watergate hearings, {{it was revealed that}} Nixon aides had drawn up what became known as Nixon's Enemies List, and Daniel Schorr was on that list. Famously, Schorr read the list aloud on live TV, surprised to be reading his own name in that context. Schorr won Emmys for news reporting in 1972, 1973, and 1974.|$|E

500|$|In later years, {{the tunnel}} {{has been used}} by persons who needed to exit or depart the White House without public or press attention. Tricia Nixon and her husband, Edward F. Cox, {{departed}} the White House via the tunnel after their 1972 Rose Garden wedding. According to Bill Gulley, longtime head of the White House Military Office, the tunnel was used by male <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>aides</b> to sneak their girlfriends and mistresses into the building to have sexual intercourse in the Lincoln Bedroom during the presidencies of Lyndon Johnson and [...] Jimmy Carter. Lyndon Johnson also used the tunnel to avoid Vietnam War protesters when departing the White House.

2500|$|Worried Republicans waited {{throughout}} {{the spring and}} summer for a Teamster endorsement, but it was not forthcoming. [...] In early August, Presser finally told <b>White</b> <b>House</b> <b>aides</b> that Teamster support for Reagan hinged on whether Reagan would remove Donald Dotson as chairman of the National Labor Relations Board. The Dotson-led labor board had issued a string of decisions which the Teamsters considered anti-labor. On the eve of the Republican National Convention, Presser told the press that Dotson's removal was a [...] "do-or-die situation" [...] for the Teamsters—which held more NLRB-supervised organizing elections than any other union. Reagan refused to fire Dotson, although presidential aides said that a compromise would be reached over the NLRB's actions.|$|E

2500|$|That February 4, President Lyndon Johnson {{made his}} first public {{statement}} {{in support of the}} Selma campaign. At midday, Judge Thomas, at the Justice Department's urging, issued an injunction that suspended Alabama’s current literacy test, ordered Selma to take at least 100 applications per registration day, and guaranteed that all applications received by June 1 would be processed before July. In response to Thomas' favorable ruling, and in alarm at Malcolm X's visit, Andrew Young, who was not in charge of the Selma movement, said he would suspend demonstrations. James Bevel, however, continued to ask people to line up at the voter's registration office as they had been doing, and Dr. King called Young from jail, telling him the demonstrations would continue. They did so the next day, and more than 500 protesters were arrested. On February 5, King bailed himself and Abernathy out of jail. On February 6, the White House announced that it would urge Congress to enact a voting rights bill during the current session, and that the Vice-President and Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach would meet with King in the following week.
