We further show that in a world without financial investors, purely financial bilateral instruments, such as forward contracts, achieve optimal risk sharing without distorting product market outcomes.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{potentially}} benign naked exclusion mechanism {{that can be}} applied to sequential innovation; a non-patentable original innovation by the incumbent supplier fosters derivative innovation by rivals. In the absence of an appropriate legal framework, the original innovator 2 ̆ 019 s equilibrium <b>exclusivity</b> <b>contracts</b> block subsequent efficient entry even if there is (leader-follower) competition in the contracting phase. However, the legal framework may maximize social welfare by imposing a ban on upfront lumps-sum payments in <b>exclusivity</b> <b>contracts</b> (by all suppliers) combined with an outright ban on <b>exclusivity</b> <b>contracts</b> by the derivative innovator. The former ban precludes the exclusion of socially beneficial derivative innovation by causing the incumbent supplier to resort to accommodation, rather than to pure exclusion, strategies. The latter ban complements the former by preventing inefficient or excessive derivative innovation...|$|R

40|$|It is well {{established}} that an incumbent firm may use <b>exclusivity</b> <b>contracts</b> so as to monopolize an industry or deter entry.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{theoretical}} model to examine advertising choices by producers in a differentiated product duopoly. The model includes the media (referred to as stations) that sell advertising space to producers and broadcast advertising messages to consumers. Producers and stations enter bilateral negotiations {{to determine the}} price of advertising space. We show that more differentiated media stations and improved effectiveness of primetime advertising yield higher levels of advertising and lower profit margins for producers as well as stations. In contrast, more differentiated product markets enhance the profitability of both {{the media and the}} product markets. We further examine the impact on advertising choices of stations offering <b>exclusivity</b> <b>contracts.</b> In the presence of <b>exclusivity</b> <b>contracts,</b> producers’ incentive to advertise is lower than without such contracts...|$|R

40|$|In {{the case}} of {{vertically}} differentiated products, Bertrand competition at the retail level does not prevent an incumbent upstream firm from using <b>exclusivity</b> <b>contracts</b> to deter the entry of a high-quality rival. Indeed, because of differentiation, the incumbent's inferior product is not eliminated upon entry. Due to the resulting competitive pressure, a retailer who considers rejecting the <b>exclusivity</b> <b>contract</b> expects to earn {{much less than the}} incumbent's monopoly rents. Thus, in equilibrium, the incumbent can always offer high enough an upfront payment to induce all retailers to sign the contract and achieve exclusion. This is true under linear pricing for intermediate levels of entry costs, and with two-part tariffs {{even in the absence of}} entry costs. Copyright 2010 The Author.
