500|$|Reagan's {{health and}} {{well-being}} became a prominent concern in 2008. In February, she suffered a fall at her Bel Air home and was taken to Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California. Doctors reported {{that she did not}} break her hip as feared, and she was released from the hospital two days later. News commentators noted that Reagan's step had slowed significantly, as the following month she walked in very slow strides <b>with</b> <b>John</b> <b>McCain.</b> NBC's Brian Williams, who attended a dinner with Reagan in mid-2008, recalled, [...] "Mrs. Reagan's vision isn't what it always was so she was taking very halting steps as a lot of folks her age do... It is so important for folks in her age bracket and in her bracket of life to remain upright and captain of their own ship. She very much is captain of her own ship." [...] As for her mental ability, Williams remarked, [...] "She's as sharp as ever and enjoys a robust life with her friends in California, but falling is always a danger of course. She's a very stoic, hardy person full of joy and excitement for life... She is not without opinions on politics and political types these days... She is, as most of her friends described her, a pistol." ...|$|E
500|$|Possessed of {{a strong}} intelligence, McCain did well in a few {{subjects}} that interested him, such as English literature, history, and government. [...] There was a fixed Bachelor of Science curriculum taken by all midshipmen; [...] McCain's classmates were impressed by his cramming abilities on mathematics, science, and engineering courses and thought his low grades were by inclination and not ability, while McCain would later acknowledge that those courses were a struggle for him. [...] His class rank was further lowered by poor grades for conduct and leadership, which reflected his sloppy appearance, rebellious attitude, and poor relations with his company officer. [...] Despite his low standing, he was popular and a leader among his fellow midshipmen, in what biographer Robert Timberg called a [...] "manic, intuitive, highly idiosyncratic way". Good at attracting women, he was famed for organizing off-Yard activities with a group who called themselves [...] "the Bad Bunch"; one classmate said that [...] "being on liberty <b>with</b> <b>John</b> <b>McCain</b> was {{like being in a}} train wreck." [...] Other midshipmen were annoyed by his behavior. [...] A June 1957 training cruise aboard the destroyer [...] found McCain showing good skills at the conn, and the destination stop in Rio de Janeiro led to a dream-like romance with Brazilian fashion model and ballerina Maria Gracinda that persisted through a Christmastime reunion.|$|E

500|$|McCain and {{his wife}} Carol had been briefly {{separated}} soon after returning to Washington, but then reunited and remained married. In April 1979, while attending a military reception for senators in Hawaii, McCain met Cindy Lou Hensley, eighteen years his junior, a teacher from Phoenix, Arizona and the daughter of James Willis Hensley, a wealthy Anheuser-Busch beer distributor, and Marguerite [...] "Smitty" [...] Hensley. They began dating, travelling between Arizona and Washington to see each other, and John McCain urged his wife Carol to accept a divorce. The McCains stopped cohabiting in January 1980, and John McCain filed for divorce in February, which Carol McCain accepted at that time. After she {{did not respond to}} court summonses, the uncontested divorce became official in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, on April 2, 1980. McCain gave Carol a settlement that included full custody of their children, alimony, child support including college tuition, houses in Virginia and Florida, and lifelong financial support for her ongoing medical treatments resulting from the 1969 automobile accident; they would remain on good terms. McCain and Hensley were married on May 17, 1980 in Phoenix, with Senators William Cohen and Gary Hart as best man and groomsman. McCain's children were upset with him and did not attend the wedding, but after several years they reconciled with him and Cindy. Carol McCain became a personal assistant to Nancy Reagan and later Director of the White House Visitors Office. The Reagans were stunned by the divorce; Nancy Reagan's relationship <b>with</b> <b>John</b> <b>McCain</b> turned cold for a while following it, but eventually the two renewed their friendship. The same happened with most of McCain's other friends, who were eventually won over by the force of his personality and his frequent expressions of guilt over what had happened.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a heated}} Senate floor speech in July 2015, Cruz accused Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of telling [...] "a {{flat-out}} lie" [...] over his intentions to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United States, which Cruz opposes. [...] "What {{we just saw}} today was an absolute demonstration that not only what he told every Republican senator, but what he told the press {{over and over and}} over again was a simple lie", Cruz said of Senate Republican Leader McConnell. Cruz's [...] "incendiary outburst" [...] was [...] "unusual in the cordial atmosphere of the Senate", according to Reuters. In the same speech, Cruz assailed the [...] "Republican majority in both houses of Congresses" [...] for what Cruz termed an insufficiently conservative record. Cruz's speech, and especially his accusation against McConnell, was condemned by various senior Republican senators, <b>with</b> <b>John</b> <b>McCain</b> saying that the speech was [...] "outside the realm of Senate behavior" [...] and [...] "a very wrong thing to do". Orrin Hatch expressed a similar opinion: [...] "I don't condone the use of that kind of language against another senator unless they can show definitive proof that there was a lie ...

[...] Cruz had alleged that McConnell scheduled a vote on the Ex-Im Bank as part of a deal to persuade Democrats like Maria Cantwell to stop blocking a trade bill, whereas McConnell denied there was any [...] "deal", and that denial is what Cruz termed a [...] "lie"; Hatch says McConnell did pledge to help Cantwell get a vote on the Ex-Im Bank.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} the {{supporters}} of the counter-protests have voiced suspicions regarding the purported involvement (including the alleged offering of remuneration) of influential US-based activists and think tanks in providing impetus for the demonstrations, though this remains a fringe view among scholars. Similar conspiracy theories have been espoused by figures like Biser Milanov (who did not self-identify as a counter-protester, but was believed to fit this description by protest activists), who made a statement at the Council of Ministers in August 2013, in which he affirmed that his [...] "National Liberty" [...] movement would only support the government if it took adequate measures against [...] "paid protesters", entailing granting them permission to create [...] "volunteer patrols" [...] who would operate together with police officers and apprehend [...] "all protest organizers who are driven {{by a desire to}} promote George Soros' interests in Bulgaria". Rapper Mihail Mihaylov, who has been described in the media as [...] "one of the faces of the counter-protests", has in a similar fashion expressed dismay at the alleged meddling of outside agents in Bulgarian affairs and in addition to that criticized the Borisov Government for its supposed authoritarian tendencies, thus subscribing to the argument that GERB was bound to be the beneficiary of any anti-government protests. According to research conducted by the Sofia Open Society Institute covering the months of June and July, only 7.4% of respondents cited the concern that GERB could return to the helm of the country as being among their reasons for refusing to participate in a protest. Journalist Petar Volgin, who has been noted for his anti-protest philosophy in contrast to other media anchors, echoed some of the sentiments of the conspiracy theorists, maintaining that the spontaneity of the protests only persisted until about their fifth day, after which they were taken over by a collection of interested [...] "political engineers" [...] – right-wing activists, GERB affiliates and [...] "tipping point" [...] circles with close connections to selected oligarchs. Columnists associated with the Ataka party compare the protests to the Otpor! movement as well as the various colour revolutions that are also purported to have been sponsored by pro-US activists and NGOs that are claimed to promote undesirable political correctness norms in Eastern European countries. Thus, foreign agents were deemed capable of exerting an influence of the momentum and intensity of the protests, with one of the speculations being that the government's decision to implicitly give the green light regarding the construction of a 7th unit of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant (to be commissioned to American company Westinghouse), placated the pro-American NGOs in Bulgaria and brought about a dwindling in the protest waves. During the protests and following their cessation, Volen Siderov has referred to them as [...] "an attempt to pull off a Bulgarian Maidan". He has also alleged that Oresharski had a pang of conscience and decided to resign after refusing to accede to American demands (with the insistence to abandon South Stream being the only one to be made public) put forth during a meeting <b>with</b> <b>John</b> <b>McCain</b> in June 2014, which included (amongst others) providing the United States with a carte blanche to use Bulgarian military airports for the purpose of military and logistical actions in light of the Ukrainian crisis as well as sending Bulgarian troops to fight against the pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine. It has been alleged that parties such as BSP encouraged their supporters to flood Internet forums with anti-protest messages (attempting to divert discussions in the direction of conspiracy theories).|$|E
