30|$|Introduction: During <b>weaning</b> <b>from</b> {{invasive}} {{mechanical ventilation}} (IMV), pulmonary oedema may develop due to cardiac failure, {{and it is}} a cause of failure in <b>weaning</b> <b>from</b> IMV. Cardiogenic pulmonary oedema produces hemoconcentration and haematocrit (Ht) is a good marker of hemoconcentration. It is not determined if the increase of Ht during weaning protocol may predict failure in <b>weaning</b> <b>from</b> IMV.|$|R

30|$|Taken together, {{levosimendan}} might exert {{a double}} beneficial effect during the critical period of <b>weaning</b> <b>from</b> mechanical ventilation in difficult-to-wean patients with impaired cardiovascular function.

Therefore, its efficacy and safety regarding this indication are still uncertain.|$|R

40|$|Thirty {{patients}} (pts) {{have undergone}} ventricular assist pumping {{for up to}} 25. 4 days (mean 6. 8 days). Twenty-eight pts could not be <b>weaned</b> <b>from</b> cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) after open heart operations and two pts sustained myocardial infarctions (MI), with cardiogenic shock unresponsive to medical therapy previous to surgery. Twenty-two pts required left ventricular assistance (LVA); 55 % (12 / 22) were <b>weaned</b> <b>from</b> the pump and 32 % (7 / 22) survived. Two pts required right ventricular assistance (RVA); both were <b>weaned</b> <b>from</b> the pump and survived. Six pts required right and left ventricular assistance (BVA) and none survived. Postoperative survival for program years 1976 through 1979 (14 pts) was 14 % (2 / 14). Postoperative survival for program years 1980 through 1982 (16 pts) was 44 % (7 / 16), reflecting improved pump insertion techniques (left atrial cannulation) and pt management. Since 1980, 12 pts have required LVA, nine have been <b>weaned</b> <b>from</b> the pump, and six pts have survived (50 %). One pt has required RVA and has survived, and three pts requiring BVA did not survive. Seven pts have been alive and well 5, 9, 14, 19, 24, 30 and 36 months after surgery. Five are NYHA functional Class I status and two pts are NYHA Class II status.
