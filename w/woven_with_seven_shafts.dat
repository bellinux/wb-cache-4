5000|$|The mighty {{king of the}} Kalingas, Srutayush, {{accompanied}} by a large army advanced towards Bhima’s car. The ruler of the Kalingas with many thousands of cars, supported by Ketumat, {{the son of the}} king of the Nishadas, with 10000 elephants and the Nishada army, surrounded Bhimasena, on all sides. Then the Chedis, the Matsyas, and Karushas, with Bhimasena at their head, with many kings impetuously rushed against the Nishadas. Terrific was the collision that took place between the few and many, between the Chedis on the one side and the Kalingas and the Nishadas on the other. The Chedis, abandoning Bhima, turned back. But Bhima, encountering all the Kalingas, did not turn back. Bhima, staying on his car whose steeds had been slain, hurled at Sakradeva, the son of the Kalinga King Srutayush, a mace made of the hardest iron. And slain by that mace, the son of the ruler of the Kalingas, from his car, fell down on the ground, with his standard and charioteer. Later he slew Bhanumat, the prince of Kalingas, by ascending the back of his elephant and cutting his body in half, with sword. Bhima drawing his bow slew the ruler of the Kalingas, Srutayush, <b>with</b> <b>seven</b> <b>shafts</b> made wholly of iron. And with two shafts he slew the two protectors of the car-wheels of the Kalinga King. And he also dispatched Satyadeva and Satya. (6,54) ...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{adenovirus}} (Ad) as {{an efficient}} and versatile vector for in vivo tumor therapy requires the modulation of its cellular tropism. We previously developed {{a method to}} genetically alter the tropism of Ad 5 fibers by replacing the fiber knob domain by an extrinsic trimerization motif and a new cellular ligand. However, fibers carrying complex ligands such as single-chain antibody fragments did not assemble into functional pentons in vitro {{in the presence of}} penton base, and failed to be rescued into infectious virions because of their inability to fold correctly within the cytoplasm of Ad-infected cells. Here we show that the coding sequence for a disulfide bond-independent three-helix bundle scaffold Z, derived from domain B of Staphylococcal protein A and capable of binding to the Fc portion of immunoglobulin (Ig) G 1, could be incorporated into modified knobless Ad fiber gene constructs <b>with</b> <b>seven</b> <b>shaft</b> repeats. These fiber gene constructs could be rescued into viable virions that were demonstrated to enter 293 cells engineered for IgG Fc surface expression but not unmodified 293 cells, via a mechanism that could be specifically blocked with soluble Fc target protein. However, the tropism modified viruses showed a slightly impaired cellular entry and a lower infectivity than wildtype (WT) virus. In addition, we generated recombinant fibers containing an IgA binding Affibody ligand, derived from combinatorial specificity-engineering of the Z domain scaffold. Such fiber constructs also showed the expected target specific binding, indicating that the affibody protein class is ideally suited for genetic engineering of Ad tropism...|$|R
40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) do {{not express}} the coxsackie-adenovirus (Ad) receptor and are poorly permissive to Ad serotype 5 (Ad 5). Genetically modified, coxsackie-Ad receptor-independent Ad 5 vectors were studied for gene delivery in human RA FLS and synovium explants and murine collagen-induced arthritis. Short-fiber Ad 5 vectors <b>with</b> <b>seven</b> fiber <b>shaft</b> repeats Ad 5 GFP-R 7 -knob, Ad 5 GFP-R 7 -arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) (RGD-liganded), and Ad 5 GFPDeltaknob (knob-deleted) {{were compared with}} Ad 5 GFP-FiWT, a conventional wild-type (WT) Ad 5 vector. Gene transfer by Ad 5 GFP-R 7 -knob and Ad 5 GFP-R 7 -RGD was 40 - to 50 -fold and 25 -fold higher, respectively, than Ad 5 GFP-FiWT in FLS. Ad 5 GFPDeltaknob was more efficacious than its knob-bearing version Ad 5 GFP-R 7 -knob in FLS transduction. Virus attachment and entry required RGD- and LDV-binding integrins including alpha(v), alpha(v) beta 3, a(v) beta 5, and beta 1. Ad 5 GFP-R 7 -knob infection of FLS was partially neutralized by synovial fluid (SF), but remained 30 - to 40 -fold higher than Ad 5 GFP-FiWT {{in the presence of}} SF. Ad 5 GFPDeltaknob was partially neutralized by SF at low virus input, but escaped viral neutralization by SF at higher virus input. Gene transfer to human synovium ex vivo explants and murine collagen-induced arthritis in vivo was also more efficient with short fiber-modified vectors (with and without the knob domain) than Ad 5 GFPFiWT. Gene transfer by short fiber-modified vectors was enhanced by inflammatory cytokines in vitro and in the presence of inflammation in murine synovium in vivo. Our data indicated that the highly efficient gene delivery RA was mediated by RGD- and non-RGD-binding integrins and enhanced by inflammation. Short fiber modifications with knob ablation may be a strategy to enhance gene delivery, reducing vector dose and vector-induced inflammation and toxicity...|$|R
