50|$|One <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{operates}} the brake on each wheel. Two pistons operate the shoes, one {{at each end}} of the <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The leading shoe (closest to the front of the vehicle) is known as the primary shoe. The trailing shoe is known as the secondary shoe. Hydraulic pressure from the master cylinder acts on the piston cup, pushing the pistons toward the shoes, forcing them against the drum. When the driver releases the brakes, the brake shoe springs restore the shoes to their original (disengaged) position. The parts of the <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder</b> are shown to the right.|$|E

50|$|Alternatively, in a drum brake, {{the fluid}} enters a <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder</b> and presses {{one or two}} brake shoes against {{the inside of the}} {{spinning}} drum. The brake shoes use a similar heat-tolerant friction material to the pads used in disc brakes.|$|E

50|$|A <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder</b> is a {{component}} in a drum brake system. It {{is located in}} each wheel and is usually positioned {{at the top of}} the wheel, above the shoes. Its function is to exert force onto the shoes so as to bring them into contact with the drum and stop the vehicle with friction. The wheel cylinders are usually connected to the shoes with small bird-beak shaped rods.|$|E
50|$|The <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{consists}} of a cylinder that has two pistons, one on each side. Each piston has a rubber seal and a shaft that connects the piston with a brake shoe. When brake pressure is applied, the pistons are forced out pushing the shoes {{into contact with the}} drum. Some designs use two single piston wheel cylinders, one {{at the top of the}} drum and one at the bottom, each connected to one brake shoe.|$|E
50|$|When {{the brakes}} are applied, brake fluid is forced under {{pressure}} from the master cylinder into the <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder,</b> which in turn pushes the brake shoes into contact with the machined surface {{on the inside of the}} drum. This rubbing action reduces the rotation of the brake drum, which is coupled to the wheel. Hence the speed of the vehicle is reduced. When the pressure is released, return springs pull the shoes back to their rest position.|$|E

50|$|Brake fluids {{must not}} corrode the metals used inside {{components}} such as calipers, <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinders,</b> master cylinders and ABS control valves. They must also protect against corrosion as moisture enters the system. Additives (corrosion inhibitors) {{are added to}} the base fluid to accomplish this. Silicone is less corrosive to paintwork unlike glycol-ether based DOT fluids.|$|R
50|$|Certain {{heavier duty}} drum brake systems {{compensate}} for load when determining <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder</b> pressure; a feature rare when discs are employed (Hydropneumatic suspension systems as employed on Citroën vehicles adjust brake pressure depending on load regardless of if drum or discs are used). One such vehicle is the Jeep Comanche. The Comanche can automatically send more {{pressure to the}} rear drums {{depending on the size}} of the load. Most other brands have used load sensing valves in the hydraulics to the rear axle for decades.|$|E
50|$|The parking (or emergency) {{brake system}} {{controls}} the brakes {{through a series}} of steel cables that are connected to either a hand lever or a foot pedal. The idea is that the system is fully mechanical and completely bypasses the hydraulic system so that the vehicle can be brought to a stop even if there is a total brake failure. Here the cable pulls on a lever mounted in the brake and is directly connected to the brake shoes. This has the effect of bypassing the <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder</b> and controlling the brakes directly.|$|E
50|$|The modern {{automobile}} {{drum brake}} {{was first used}} in a car made by Maybach in 1900, although the principle was only later patented in 1902 by Louis Renault. He used woven asbestos lining for the drum brake lining, as no alternative dissipated heat like the asbestos lining, though Maybach had used a less sophisticated drum brake. In the first drum brakes, levers and rods or cables operated the shoes mechanically. From the mid-1930s, oil pressure in a small <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder</b> and pistons (as in the picture) operated the brakes, though some vehicles continued with purely mechanical systems for decades. Some designs have two wheel cylinders.|$|E
50|$|The {{process is}} {{performed}} by forcing clean, bubble-free brake fluid {{through the entire}} system, usually from the master cylinder(s) to the calipers of disc brakes (or the <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinders</b> of drum brakes), but in certain cases in the opposite direction. A brake bleed screw is normally mounted at the highest point on each cylinder or caliper.|$|R

5000|$|The 1979 {{model year}} saw a new {{downsized}} Newport on the Chrysler R platform, a derivative of the circa 1962 Chrysler B platform. This reduced model availability {{to a single}} [...] "pillared hardtop" [...] 4-door sedan. While GM and Ford had downsized their big cars by engineering smaller bodies around more spacious passenger accommodations, Chrysler took a different approach. The existing Chrysler B platform was modified to improve fuel efficiency {{through a number of}} weight saving measures. Examples include plastic brake <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder</b> pistons, which tended to swell and bind up the brakes after a some years in service. Chrome-plated aluminum bumpers were another innovation, but were replaced in 1980 with a stronger steel rear bumper. The large displacement V8 engines were dropped.|$|E
50|$|Brake {{shoes are}} {{typically}} made of {{two pieces of}} steel welded together. The friction material is either riveted to the lining table or attached with adhesive. The crescent-shaped piece is called the Web and contains holes and slots in different shapes for return springs, hold-down hardware, parking brake linkage and self-adjusting components. All the application force of the <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder</b> is applied through the web to the lining table and brake lining. The edge of the lining table generally has three “V"-shaped notches or tabs on each side called nibs. The nibs rest against the support pads of the backing plate to which the shoes are installed.Each brake assembly has two shoes, a primary and secondary. The primary shoe is located {{toward the front of}} the vehicle and has the lining positioned differently from the secondary shoe. Quite often, the two shoes are interchangeable, so close inspection for any variation is important. Linings must be resistant to heat and wear and have a high friction coefficient unaffected by fluctuations in temperature and humidity.Materials that make up the brake shoe include, friction modifiers (which can include graphite and cashew nut shells), powdered metal such as lead, zinc, brass, aluminium and other metals that resist heat fade, binders, curing agents and fillers such as rubber chips to reduce brake noise.|$|E

5000|$|Brake fluid is {{subjected}} to very high temperatures, especially in the <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinders</b> of drum brakes and disk brake calipers. It must have a high boiling point to avoid vaporizing in the lines. This vaporization is a problem because vapor is highly compressible relative to liquid, and therefore negates the hydraulic transfer of braking force - so the brakes will fail to stop the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|A hog oiler was a {{mechanical}} device employed on farms {{to be used}} by hogs to provide relief from insects and offer skin protection. It consisted of a reservoir to hold oil, and a means to distribute the oil onto the hog, often via grooved <b>wheels</b> or <b>cylinders.</b> Hogs seeking relief would rub up against a <b>wheel</b> (or <b>cylinder)</b> causing it to rotate and dispense oil onto their bodies.|$|R

The brake system model includes the controller, intensifier, brake lines, <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder,</b> and foundational drum brake, which are presented for the interaction with the application system. A generalized AOH brake system, based on systems analysis level for the components, is formulated in detail. The pipeline hysteresis and fluid fluctuation of the brake system have been investigated in detail. Many experiments were performed on a bench setup of the AOH brake system and real vehicles. The experimental data is compared with the model simulation results. Preliminary {{results show that the}} simulation matches the experimental data closely. The models, which are developed from physical laws, are intended for use in the design and analysis of vehicle control systems for CVs...|$|E
40|$|Unified brake {{service is}} a {{universal}} service for generating certain brake force {{to meet the demand}} deceleration and is essential for an automated driving system. However, it is rather difficult to control the pressure in the wheel cylinders to reach the target deceleration of the automated vehicle, which is the key issue of the active deceleration control system (ADC). This paper proposes a hierarchical control method to actively control vehicle deceleration with active-brake actuators. In the upper hierarchical, the target pressure of wheel cylinders is obtained by dynamic equations of a pure electric vehicle. In the lower hierarchical, the solenoid valve instructions and the pump speed of hydraulic control unit (HCU) are determined to satisfy the desired pressure with the feedback of measured <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder</b> pressure by pressure sensors. Results of road experiments of a pure electric and automated vehicle indicate that the proposed method realizes the target deceleration accurately and efficiently...|$|E

It was built by Auto Specialties Manufacturing Company (Ausco) of St. Joseph, Michigan, under patents of inventor H.L. Lambert, and was first tested on a 1939 Plymouth. Unlike the caliper disc, the Ausco-Lambert utilized twin expanding discs that rubbed against the inner surface of a cast iron brake drum, which doubled as the brake housing. The discs spread apart to create friction against the inner drum surface through the action of standard <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinders.</b>|$|R

It retained the same <b>wheels,</b> <b>cylinders,</b> motion, {{and much of the}} frame of the K, but featured a longer boiler with a wider, larger grate, mounted above the frames and supported by a trailing truck. This enabled possible gauge conversion without radical re-engineering of the frames and grate.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} multifunctional MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical System) sensor system for the simultaneous measurement of pressure and temperature inside a hydraulic system, more specifically a hydraulic brake system for automotive applications. The multifunctional pressure and temperature sensor system presented in this Thesis was designed to be installed in a new brake-by-wire system that requires the simultaneous reading of pressure and temperature per <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder.</b> This system needs to control and monitor these parameters at each <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinder</b> to adjust the pressure for optimal braking. Current sensing systems installed in regular brake systems use a single pressure sensor that is positioned in the main cylinder and they do not include a temperature sensor. Moreover, while numerous approaches have been taken to control and monitor the pressure in a brake system real-time, no MEMS sensor system has yet been reported that can carry out real-time measurements of the brake system's pressure and temperature. 	In a representative automobile hydraulic brake system, the pressure and temperature can reach up to about 4 Mpa and 120 °C, respectively. These conditions are developed in an oily environment with a pH ~ 11. The multifunctional sensor system presented here is based on the two sensors, one for pressure and one for temperature, working within the same packaging. These two sensors are glued on the surface of an adequate Transistor Outline (TO) base using a temperature resistance adhesive. The substrate with the two sensors is covered by a parylene layer for dielectric protection, protection from the corrosive medium and protection from the moisture inherent in the brake fluid. The interface of the sensor system to the hydraulic brake system uses a commercial 1 / 4 18 NPT fitting customized to serve as an interface as well as a metal shell between the sensor and the hydraulic cylinder. The TO base and the metal shell were joined by micro-brazing to minimize heat-affected areas and ensure that critical components are unharmed. A finite element model to understand the effect of the parylene layer on the performance of the sensors was developed using COMSOL Multiphysics®. The model was validated by testing many prototypes of the developed sensor system using a custom made hydraulic hand pump which pressure is monitored by a digital hydraulic pressure gauge. The sample fitting is covered by a coil heater that includes a type -T Thermocouple positioned close to the sample to monitor the temperature. The complete apparatus allowed characterization of the test sensor from room pressure (13 psi) to 500 psi over a temperature range of 25 to 120 °C. The test samples were characterized from atmospheric pressure to 450 psi over a temperature range of 25 to 120 °C. The experimental data shows a reduction in pressure sensitivity of 18. 2 % due to the parylene layer which closely agrees with the model predictions of a reduction of 21 %. In summary, a multifunctional sensor system has been developed {{that can be used to}} control and monitor the pressure and temperature of a hydraulic cylinder real-time. The sensor system is novel in that it measures both parameters at a single point real-time with good sensitivity and accuracy making it ideal for applications in brake-by-wire systems...|$|E

50|$|Also, {{drum brakes}} {{do not apply}} {{immediately}} when the <b>wheel</b> <b>cylinders</b> are pressurized, because {{the force of the}} return springs must be overcome before the shoes start to move towards the drum. This means that the very common hybrid disc/drum systems only brake with the discs on light pedal pressure unless extra hardware is added. In practice, a metering valve prevents hydraulic pressure from reaching the front calipers until pressure rises enough to overcome the return springs in the drum brakes. If the metering valve were left out, the vehicle would stop only with the front discs until return spring pressure on the rear shoes were overcome.|$|R
