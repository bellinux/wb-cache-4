5|$|After {{extensive}} reorganization {{during the}} winter of 1863–1864, <b>Walker</b> and the Army of the Potomac fought in the Overland Campaign through May and June 1864. The Battle of Cold Harbor in early June took a substantial toll on the ranks of the II Corps and <b>Walker</b> injured his knee during the battle. In the ensuing Richmond-Petersburg Campaign, <b>Walker</b> was appointed a brevet colonel. However, on August 25, 1864, as he rode to find Maj. Gen. John Gibbon at the front during the Second Battle of Ream's Station, <b>Walker</b> was surrounded and captured by the 11th Georgia Infantry. On August 27, <b>Walker</b> was able to escape from a marching prisoner column with another prisoner but was recaptured by the 51st North Carolina Infantry after trying to swim across the Appomattox River and nearly drowning. After being held as a prisoner in Petersburg, he was transferred to the infamous Libby Prison in Richmond, where his older brother was also held. In October 1864, <b>Walker</b> was released with thirty other prisoners as a part of an exchange.|$|E

50|$|Parent-assisted baby <b>walkers</b> were {{developed}} {{as an alternative}} to traditional baby <b>walkers.</b> These types of baby <b>walkers</b> differ greatly from traditional baby <b>walkers</b> as they have no wheels and require full parent assistance while in use. The design of modern parent-assisted baby <b>walkers</b> is similar to leading strings in that the child is suspended upright from straps while learning to walk. Parent-assisted baby <b>walkers</b> offer a safer method for teaching a child to walk over traditional baby <b>walkers</b> that can be unattended while in use.|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of his play in the Extraliga, <b>Walker</b> began to be noticed by the National Hockey League (NHL). In the NHL Central Scouting Bureau's January 2012 list of draft {{prospects}}, <b>Walker</b> was listed as the 21st best European-based skater for the 2012 NHL Entry Draft, the second highest Czech-based player on the list. <b>Walker</b> was listed as the 25th best European skater in the NHL's final list of prospects for the 2012 Entry Draft. He was not selected in the Entry Draft, but was {{invited to participate in the}} Washington Capitals development camp in July; however NHL rules required that <b>Walker</b> participate in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft before he was able to sign with any team.|$|E
5|$|As {{tensions}} between the North and South increased over the winter of 1860–1861, <b>Walker</b> equipped himself and began drilling with Major Devens' 3rd Battalion of Rifles in Worcester and New York. Despite his older brother Robert serving in the 34th Massachusetts Infantry, his father objected to his youngest son mobilizing with {{the first wave of}} volunteers. <b>Walker</b> returned to Worcester but began to lobby William Schouler and Governor John Andrew to grant him a commission as a second lieutenant under Devens' command of the 15th Massachusetts. Following his 21st birthday and the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861, <b>Walker</b> secured the consent of his father to join the war effort as well as assurances by Devens that he would receive an officer's commission. However, the lieutenancy never materialized and Devens instead offered <b>Walker</b> an appointment as a sergeant major, which he assumed on August 1, 1861, after re-tailoring his previously ordered lieutenant's uniform to reflect his enlisted status. However, by September 14, 1861, <b>Walker</b> had been recommended by Devens and reassigned to Brig. Gen. Darius N. Couch as assistant adjutant general and promoted to captain. <b>Walker</b> remained in Washington, D.C., over the winter of 1861–1862 and did not see combat until May 1862 at the Battle of Williamsburg. <b>Walker</b> also served at Seven Pines {{as well as at the}} Seven Days Battles of the Peninsula Campaign in the summer of 1862 under Maj.

In removing their ability to eat, Michonne effectively tamed these <b>walkers.</b> Michonne has demonstrated economic uses for her pet <b>walkers,</b> such as using them as human pack mules by loading supplies onto their backs as well as a camouflage/repellent, as their presence and scent fools other <b>walkers</b> into thinking those accompanying them are also <b>walkers.</b> Michonne later decapitates the <b>walkers</b> shortly before she and Andrea are discovered by Merle.|$|R
5|$|DNA walkers are a {{class of}} nucleic acid nanomachines that exhibit {{directional}} motion along a linear track. A large number of schemes have been demonstrated. One strategy is to control {{the motion of the}} <b>walker</b> along the track using control strands that need to be manually added in sequence. Another approach is to make use of restriction enzymes or deoxyribozymes to cleave the strands and cause the <b>walker</b> to move forward, which has the advantage of running autonomously. A later system could walk upon a two-dimensional surface rather than a linear track, and demonstrated the ability to selectively pick up and move molecular cargo. Additionally, a linear <b>walker</b> has been demonstrated that performs DNA-templated synthesis as the <b>walker</b> advances along the track, allowing autonomous multistep chemical synthesis directed by the <b>walker.</b> The synthetic DNA walkers' function {{is similar to that of}} the proteins dynein and kinesin.|$|E
5|$|During the 2012–13 season <b>Walker</b> {{appeared}} in twenty games with HC Vítkovice and recorded one assist; he was loaned to Hokej Šumperk 2003 for three games, {{where he also}} had one assist. After {{six years in the}} Czech Republic, <b>Walker</b> signed a contract on 8 January 2013 with the Youngstown Phantoms of the United States Hockey League, a junior ice hockey league in the United States. He made his debut for the team on 11 January against the Chicago Steel, recording a goal. After four games with the Phantoms, in which he recorded six points, <b>Walker</b> was named to the USHL/NHL Top Prospects Game on 23 January 2013; he replaced his teammate, who was ill. <b>Walker</b> played 29 games for the Phantoms during the regular season and recorded 27 points (7 goals, 20 assists). His 20 assists were good enough for fifth on the team, even though <b>Walker</b> only joined the team midway through the season.

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{documents that}} men and women can accurately judge male physical strength from gait, but also that the sexes differ in attractiveness judgments of strong and weak male <b>walkers.</b> Women’s (but not men’s) attractiveness assessments of strong male <b>walkers</b> are higher than for weak male <b>walkers.</b> Here, we extend this research to assessments of strong and weak male <b>walkers</b> in Chile, Germany, and Russia. Men and women judged videos of virtual characters, animated with the walk movements of motion-captured men, on strength and attractiveness. In two countries (Germany and Russia), these videos were additionally presented at 70 % (slower) and 130 % (faster) of their original speed. Stronger <b>walkers</b> were judged to be stronger and more attractive than weak <b>walkers,</b> and this effect was independent of country (but not sex). Women tended to provide higher attractiveness judgments to strong <b>walkers,</b> and men tended to provide higher attractiveness judgments to weak <b>walkers.</b> In addition, German and Russian participants rated strong <b>walkers</b> most attractive at slow and fast speed. Thus, across countries men and women can assess male strength from gait, although they tended to differ in attractiveness assessments of strong and weak male <b>walkers.</b> Attractiveness assessments of male gait may be influenced by society-specific emphasis on male physical strength...|$|R
