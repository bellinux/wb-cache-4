5|$|Around 376BC, Timanoridas of Corinth and Eukrates of Lefkada paid thirty minae to {{purchase}} Neaira from Nikarete, {{at the high}} end of prices for hetaerae. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> married, they agreed to let Neaira buy her freedom for twenty minae, which, with the aid of gifts and loans from her former customers, she did. As part of this deal, Neaira agreed to no longer work as a prostitute in Corinth, and so left the city for Athens with Phrynion, who had helped her buy her freedom.|$|E
5|$|February saw the issuing of {{equipment}} and the commencement of training, however, this was punctuated by medical inspections and dental treatment as well as ceremonial duties surrounding the commemoration of the Treaty of Waitangi. A lack of previous experience in technical trades also hampered the training of the battalion, as the unit was short of men {{who were able to}} serve in roles such as clerks, drivers and signallers because the majority of personnel were drawn from mainly rural backgrounds. Consequently, men for these roles had to be trained from scratch. The organisation of the battalion was finally completed in March, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> were allocated to their respective companies, and on 13 March 1940 the 28th (Māori) Battalion was declared on active service. After 14 days leave, the battalion conducted a five-week concentration period before embarking on 1 May 1940. The battalion's strength at this time was 39 officers and 642 other ranks.|$|E
5|$|Lucidi {{offered to}} let Edgardo's father {{accompany}} {{them to the}} inquisitor {{to discuss the matter}} with him—Momolo refused—then allowed Momolo to send his eldest son Riccardo to summon relatives and neighbours. Marianna's uncle Angelo Padovani, a prominent member of Bologna's Jewish community, concluded that their only hope was to appeal to Feletti. The inquisitor received Padovani and Marianna's brother-in-law Angelo Moscato at San Domenico soon after 23:00. Feletti said that he, like Lucidi, was merely following orders. He declined to reveal why it was thought that Edgardo had been baptised, saying that this was confidential. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> begged him to at least give the family one last day with Edgardo, the inquisitor acquiesced on the condition that no attempt was made to spirit the child away. He gave Padovani a note to this effect to pass on to the marshal. Lucidi left as ordered, leaving two men to stay in the Mortaras' bedroom and watch over Edgardo.|$|E

5|$|Cunningham and Rawnsley {{were soon}} ordered to staff positions. It was a {{compulsory}} order for fighter pilots even <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> considered themselves fit for operational duties. Before they departed Middle Wallop and 604, {{they had a}} chance to test the new 4-inch (10 cm) AI Mk. VIII radar which had a range of two or three miles (3–5 kilometres). The new radar was a radical improvement. All the information was displayed on a single tube. The ground echo was reduced but could still be seen on screen when flying low, but it did not interfere with the overall picture. Cunningham was to take over as director of all training units from Rory Chisholm who left 604 to become a staff officer at group headquarters. Rawnsley was due to take an instructors job at 62 Operational Training Unit (OTU) at Usworth. Cunningham managed to persuade the CAS to deploy him to headquarters at No. 81 Group RAF, the training organisation for RAF Fighter Command. Rawnsley was also promoted to squadron leader and was awarded the DFC and Distinguished Flying Medal (DFM). The pair remained grounded for six months until January 1943.|$|E
5|$|The {{divisions}} rested here <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>men,</b> {{horses and}} several hundred Ottoman prisoners were watered and fed. During {{this time a}} squadron led by armoured cars went ahead to reconnoitre the track across the Mount Carmel Range from Sindiane through the Abu Shusheh Pass. The reconnaissance group reported the track across the Abu Shusheh pass rough and in a bad repair. Macandrews informed Chauvel that his division would not be ready to move from Liktera before 18:15 when the 13th and 14th Cavalry Brigades would advance without wheels to negotiate the pass at night. As a consequence the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade remained to guard the guns. The artillery and the Jodhpur and 1st Hyderabad Lancers, were to follow at daylight on 20 September, while the Mysore Lancers waited at Liktera for the division's transport, which they were to guard. Chauvel arrived at Liktera after midnight on 19/20 September when he ordered the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade to take the 5th Cavalry Division's guns via J'ara and Abu Shushe. They arrived at Abu Shusheh at 03:00 and rejoin their division at Afulah during the night.|$|E

25|$|These wartime {{roles were}} eclipsed, however, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> {{and women of}} Mount Sinai's 3rd General Hospital set sail for Casablanca, {{eventually}} setting up a 1,000-bed hospital in war-torn Tunisia.

25|$|The Arkansas National Guard was {{initially}} informed that its units would {{be assigned to}} the Eighteenth Division, along with the states of Mississippi and Louisiana, and the state was directed to raise one regiment of infantry, one regiment of field artillery, and one outpost of company signal corps. The men of the Arkansas National Guard trained hard after hearing the news. Intensified cross county hiking, drilling, and maneuvering were evident <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> took sack lunches and marched into Little Rock for the Memorial Day parade with all other troops stationed at Ft.

When 7,000 Reserve Officer candidates were sent to Ft. Roots, the 1st Arkansas gave up their barracks for tents. The 1st Arkansas soldiers were given vaccinations against smallpox and typhoid fever, and then ordered to clear out brush and trees, work on post roads, and guard the camp.|$|E

However, the program was strong enough for Weir to win his first World medal – a bronze – and kept the United States from being shut out of the medals at a World Championship {{for the first time since}} 1994.|$|E
25|$|Up to 25% of {{military}} burials were of armed Sarmatian women usually including bows. Russian archaeologist Vera Kovalevskaya {{points out that}} when Scythian men were away fighting or hunting, nomadic women {{would have to be}} able to defend themselves, their animals and pasture-grounds competently. During the time that the Scythians advanced into Asia and achieved near-hegemony in the Near East, there was a period of twenty-eight years <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> would have been away on campaigns for long periods. During this time the women would not only have had to defend themselves, but to reproduce, and this could well be the origin of the idea that Amazons mated once a year with their neighbours, if Herodotus actually based his accounts on fact.|$|E
25|$|During the First World War, {{there was}} {{virtually}} no female {{presence in the}} Canadian armed forces, {{with the exception of}} the 3141 nurses serving overseas and on the home front. Of these women, 328 had been decorated by King George V, and 46 gave their lives in the line of duty. Even though a number of these women received decorations for their efforts, many high-ranking military personnel still felt that they were unfit for the job. Although the Great War, had not officially been opened up to women, they did feel the pressures at home. There had been a gap in employment <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> enlisted; many women strove to fill this void along with keeping up with their responsibilities at home.|$|E

25|$|Idema's {{allegations}} of withheld evidence were originally made during his Afghan trial in 2004. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> {{were arrested in}} early July, the tapes were confiscated by the FBI. Caraballo's lawyer, Michael Skibbie, claims {{that he was only}} allowed to access a portion of the tapes weeks after he requested access. Several of the tapes were used; however, Skibbie said several important tapes were damaged, missing or partly erased after the FBI took custody of them. Some of the footage Skibbie obtained was shown in court. The court tapes showed Idema being greeted at an airport by high level Afghan officials, Idema being thanked by Yunus Qanuni, Qanooni's troops working with Idema, captured suspects confessing during interrogation, and ISAF forces helping Idema.|$|E
25|$|One {{thing the}} two groups did agree on was {{that they wanted to}} {{discourage}} any more miners from coming up the following year. Though obliged to report their earnings, they all intended to report that the diggings were not very good and that more should be known of the country before any discoveries were reported. With the exception of Patrick Kelly and Vital LaForce, who stayed at Fort St. James, the other miners all returned to Quesnel with the news that the venture had only been marginally successful. However, suspicions were raised <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> announced they were returning to Vital Creek for the winter and even more eyebrows were raised when it was discovered that LaForce and Kelly had spent an astounding $2500 at the Fort St. James trading post.|$|E
25|$|It {{was in the}} North Shaft that a fire {{occurred}} in 1952, which caused the greatest single loss {{of life in the}} mine's entire history. An electrical fault one weekend may have started the fire. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> went to work on the Monday morning (7 July 1952), the air compressor was started up, and air from a broken air line fanned the flames, releasing poisonous carbon monoxide gas which began to circulate round the mine. Some of the men began to collapse when they reached the 175Fathom Level. Four men who had descended the 940N Winze were killed, and rescuers were driven out of the mine by the gas. The bodies could not be recovered until 16 July, and the mine did not reopen until 1 September.|$|E
