40|$|Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a neurotoxin that {{specifically}} binds to voltage gated sodium channels (NaV). TTX binding physically blocks {{the flow of}} sodium ions through NaV, thereby preventing action potential generation and propagation. TTX has different binding affinities for different NaV isoforms. These differences are imparted by amino acid substitutions in positions <b>within,</b> <b>or</b> <b>proximal</b> to, the TTX binding site in the channel pore. The garter snake Thamnophis sirtalis has evolved TTX-resistance {{over the course of}} an arms race, allowing some populations of snakes to feed on tetrodotoxic newts, including Taricha granulosa. We tested the properties of NaV with TTX resistance found in garter snake populations. We observed some surprising changes in gating properties and ion selectivity of the TTX resistant NaV. These results suggest TTX resistance comes at a cost to performance caused by changes in the biophysical properties and/or ion selectivity of the TTX resistan...|$|E
40|$|When liver cells undergo {{malignant}} transformation, certain genes cease being expressed. We {{have studied}} the structure of one such gene, whose protein product we have designated hepatic protein 22 (hp 22), which is not expressed in the two Morris hepatomas studied. We have prepared a chimeric clone of pBR 322 containing cDNA sequences complementary to mRNA coding for this protein. By using this cloned cDNA, we have examined changes in expression of this gene {{and changes in the}} restriction pattern of the DNA isolated from normal liver and these hepatomas. In both hepatomas, studies using the isoschizomeric pair of restriction enzymes Msp I and Hpa II have indicated hypermethylation of a cytosine residue <b>within</b> <b>or</b> <b>proximal</b> to the hp 22 gene. Other differences in the restriction pattern between normal liver and hepatoma DNA were also detected with EcoRI and Ava I. Thus, in the nontranscribed form of this gene, the DNA has undergone covalent modification, distinguishing these two hepatomas from each other and from normal liver...|$|E
40|$|Functional studies {{revealed}} that {{two groups of}} B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) can be distinguished based on their capacity to mount a proliferative response following B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) cross-linking. The molecular basis for the functional distinction between these B-CLL groups most probably resides <b>within</b> <b>or</b> <b>proximal</b> to the BCR since non-responsive B-CLL, {{in marked contrast to}} responsive B-CLL, do not respond to BCR ligation with tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates and increases in the free intracellular [Ca++]. Detailed biochemical analysis showed overall structural identity between responsive and non-responsive B-CLL with respect to both transmembrane and intracellular associates of the BCR complex. However expression levels of the protein tyrosine kinase syk, which is a key enzyme for the early signalling through the BCR, were found to be markedly lower in non-proliferating B-CLL. Here we will review current functional and biochemical data on responding and non-responding B-CLL and discuss the relevance of these findings for disease progression and our insight into the immunobiology of B-CL...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{high levels}} of homology, {{transcription}} coactivators p 300 and CREB binding protein (CBP) are both indispensable during embryogenesis. They are largely known to regulate the same genes. To identify genes preferentially regulated by p 300 or CBP, we performed an extensive genome-wide survey using the ChIP-seq on cell-cycle synchronized cells. We found that 57 % of the tags were <b>within</b> genes <b>or</b> <b>proximal</b> promoters, with an overall preference for binding to transcription start and end sites. The heterogeneous binding patterns possibly reflect the divergent roles of CBP and p 300 in transcriptional regulation. Most of the 16 103 genes were bound by both CBP and p 300. However, after stimulation 89 and 1944 genes were preferentially bound by CBP or p 300, respectively. Target genes {{were found to be}} primarily involved in the regulation of metabolic and developmental processes, and transcription, with CBP showing a stronger preference than p 300 for genes active in negative regulation of transcription. Analysis of transcription factor binding sites suggest that CBP and p 300 have many partners in common, but AP- 1 and Serum Response Factor (SRF) appear to be more prominent in CBP-specific sequences, whereas AP- 2 and SP 1 are enriched in p 300 -specific targets. Taken together, our findings further elucidate the distinct roles of coactivators p 300 and CBP in transcriptional regulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} glycoproteins of Crimean-Congo {{hemorrhagic fever}} virus (CCHFV; genus Nairovirus, family Bunyaviridae) are derived through endoproteolytic cleavage of a 1, 684 -amino-acid M RNA segment-encoded polyprotein. This polyprotein is cotranslationally cleaved into the PreGN and PreGC precursors, {{which are then}} cleaved by SKI- 1 and a SKI- 1 -like protease to generate the N termini of GN and GC, respectively. However, the resulting polypeptide defined by the N termini of GN and GC is predicted to be larger (58 kDa) than mature GN (37 kDa). By analogy to the topologically similar M segment-encoded polyproteins of viruses in the Orthobunyavirus genus, the C-terminal region of PreGN that contains four predicted transmembrane domains may also contain a nonstructural protein, NSM. To characterize potential PreGN C-terminal cleavage events, a panel of epitope-tagged PreGN truncation and internal deletion mutants was developed. These constructs allowed for the identification of a C-terminal endoproteolytic cleavage <b>within,</b> <b>or</b> very <b>proximal</b> to, the second predicted transmembrane domain following the GN ectodomain and the subsequent generation of a C-terminal fragment. Pulse-chase experiments showed that PreGN C-terminal cleavage occurred shortly after synthesis of the precursor and prior to generation of the GN glycoprotein. The resulting fragment trafficked to the Golgi compartment, the site of virus assembly. Development of an antiserum specific to the second cytoplasmic loop of PreGN allowed detection of cell-associated NSM proteins derived from transient expression of the complete CCHFV M segment {{and also in the}} context of virus infection...|$|R
40|$|Herpes simplex virus type 1 {{glycoprotein}} B (gB) {{is essential}} for virus entry, an event involving fusion of the virus envelope with the cell surface membrane, and virus-induced cell-cell fusion, resulting in polykaryocyte, or syncytium, formation. The experiments described in this report employed a random mutagenesis strategy to develop a more complete genetic map of mutations resulting in the syn mutant phenotype. The results indicate that syn mutations occur within two essential and highly conserved hydrophilic, alpha-helical regions of the gB cytoplasmic domain. Region I is immediately proximal to the transmembrane domain and includes residues R 796 to E 816 / 817. Region II is localized centrally in the cytoplasmic domain and includes residues A 855 and R 858. Positively charged residues were particularly affected in both regions, suggesting that charge interactions {{may be required to}} suppress the syn mutant phenotype. No syn mutations were identified within the transmembrane domain. A virus containing a rate of entry (roe) mutation at residue A 851, either <b>within</b> <b>or</b> immediately <b>proximal</b> to syn region II, was isolated. Since roe mutations have also been discovered in the external domain of gB, it appears likely that the external and cytoplasmic domains cooperate in virus penetration. Moreover, the observation that both roe and syn mutations occur in the cytoplasmic domain further suggests that gB functions in an analogous manner in both membrane fusion events. It might be predicted from these observations that membrane fusion involves transduction of a fusion signal along the gB molecule through the transmembrane domain. Communication between the external and cytoplasmic domain may thus be required for gB-mediated membrane fusion events...|$|R
40|$|Several genes located <b>within</b> <b>or</b> <b>proximal</b> to {{the human}} PAR in Xp 22 have homologues on the Y {{chromosome}} and escape, or partly escape, inactivation. To study the evolution of Xp 22 genes and their Y homologues, we applied multicolour {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) to comparatively map DNA probes for the genes ANT 3, XG, ARSD, ARSE (CDPX), PRK, STS, KAL and AMEL to prometaphase chromosomes of the human species and hominoid apes. We demonstrate that the genes residing proximal to the PAR have a highly conserved order on the higher primate X chromosomes but show considerable rearrangements on the Y chromosomes of hominoids. These rearrangements cannot be traced back to a simple model involving only a single or a few evolutionary events. The linear instability of the Y chromosomes gives some insight into the evolutionary isolation of large parts of the Y chromosomes and thus might reflect the isolated evolutionary history of the primate species over millions of years...|$|E
40|$|Normal and mutant human alpha- 1 -antitrypsin genes were cloned from a PiMZ {{heterozygous}} individual. Nucleotide sequence comparison {{demonstrated a}} T to C transition in exon III and an G to A transition in exon V of the PiZ gene. A 14. 4 kb DNA fragment containing the entire PiM gene plus 2 kb of 5 ' and 3 ' flanking genomic DNA sequences was {{introduced into the}} germ line of mice and five F 0 transgenic lines were established. Transgenic F 1 progeny from F 0 parents exhibited high levels of human alpha- 1 -antitrypsin protein in their plasma. The human gene was expressed primarily in liver of the transgenic mice {{as it is in}} man. However, expression of the human alpha- 1 -antitrypsin gene was also observed in kidneys of the transgenic mice, which led to the observation that the endogenous mouse gene is also expressed in the kidney. These data indicate that cis-acting elements <b>within</b> <b>or</b> <b>proximal</b> to the human alpha- 1 -antitrypsin gene are able to direct its in vivo transcription {{with a high degree of}} tissue specificity...|$|E
40|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is {{the most}} common {{neurodegenerative}} disorder. Using discrete disease status as the phenotype and computing statistics at the single marker level {{may not be able to}} address the underlying biological interactions that contribute to disease mechanism and may contribute to the issue of “missing heritability. ” We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a genome-wide interaction study (GWIS) of an amyloid imaging phenotype, using the data from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We investigated the genetic main effects and interaction effects on cingulate amyloid-beta (Aβ) load in an effort to better understand the genetic etiology of Aβ deposition that is a widely studied AD biomarker. PLINK was used in the single marker GWAS, and INTERSNP was used to perform the two-marker GWIS, focusing only on SNPs with p≤ 0. 01 for the GWAS analysis. Age, sex, and diagnosis were used as covariates in both analyses. Corrected p values using the Bonferroni method were reported. The GWAS analysis revealed significant hits <b>within</b> <b>or</b> <b>proximal</b> to APOE, APOC 1, and TOMM 40 genes, which were previously implicated in AD. The GWIS analysis yielded 8 novel SNP-SNP interaction findings that warrant replication and further investigation...|$|E

40|$|Identifying DNA polymorphisms {{that affect}} {{molecular}} processes like transcription, splicing, or translation typically requires genotyping and experimentally characterizing tissue from {{large numbers of}} individuals, which remains expensive and time consuming. Here we introduce an alternative strategy: a "synthetic association study" in which we computationally predict molecular phenotypes on artificial genomes containing randomly sampled combinations of polymorphic alleles, and perform a classical association study to identify genotypes underlying variation in these computationally predicted annotations. We applied this method to characterize the effects on gene structure of 32, 792 single-nucleotide polymorphisms between two strains of the antibiotic producing fungus Penicilium chrysogenum. Although these SNPs represent only 0. 1 percent of the nucleotides in the genome, they collectively altered 1. 8 percent of predicted gene models between these strains. To determine which SNPs or combinations of SNPs were responsible for this variation, we predicted protein-coding genes in 500 intermediate genomes, each identical except for randomly chosen alleles at each SNP position. Of 30, 468 gene models in the genome, 557 varied across these 500 genomes. 226 of these polymorphic gene models (40 %) were perfectly correlated with individual SNPs, {{all of which were}} <b>within</b> <b>or</b> immediately <b>proximal</b> to the affected gene. The genetic architectures of the other 321 were more complex, with several examples of SNP epistasis that would have been difficult to predict a priori. We expect that many of the SNPs that affect computational gene structure reflect a biologically unrealistic sensitivity of the gene prediction algorithm to sequence changes, and we propose that genome annotation algorithms could be improved by minimizing their sensitivity to natural polymorphisms. However, many of the SNPs we identified are likely to affect transcript structure in vivo, and the synthetic association study approach can be easily generalized to any computed genome annotation to uncover relationships between genotype and important molecular phenotypes...|$|R

Hence, we examined whether bone resorption, as reflected by serum ß-C-telopeptides of type I collagen (CTX), is {{positively associated with}} periosteal circumference (PC), in contrast to inverse associations with parameters related to bone remodelling such as cortical bone mineral density (BMDC). CTX and mid-tibial pQCT scans were available in 1130 adolescents (mean age 15. 5 years) from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, time of sampling, tanner stage, lean mass, fat mass and height. CTX {{was positively related to}} PC [ß= 0. 19 (0. 13, 0. 24) ] (coefficient?=?SD change per SD increase in CTX, 95 % CI) ], but inversely associated with BMDC [ß= - 0. 46 (- 0. 52,- 0. 40) ] and cortical thickness [ß= - 0. 11 (- 0. 18, - 0. 03) ]. CTX was positively related to bone strength as reflected by the strength-strain index (SSI) [ß= 0. 09 (0. 03, 0. 14) ]. To examine the causal nature of this relationship, we then analysed whether SNPs within key osteoclast regulatory genes, known to reduce areal/cortical BMD, conversely increase PC.

40|$|Human {{influenza}} viruses can {{be isolated}} efficiently from clinical samples using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. However, {{this process is}} known to induce mutations in the virus as it adapts to this non-human cell-line. We performed a systematic study to record the pattern of MDCK-induced mutations observed across the whole influenza A/H 3 N 2 genome. Seventy-seven clinical samples collected from 2009 - 2011 {{were included in the}} study. Two full influenza genomes were obtained for each sample: one from virus obtained directly from the clinical sample and one from the matching isolate cultured in MDCK cells. Comparison of the full-genome sequences obtained from each of these sources showed that 42 % of the 77 isolates had acquired at least one MDCK-induced mutation. The presence or absence of these mutations was independent of viral load or sample origin (in-patients versus out-patients). Notably, all the five hemagglutinin missense mutations were observed at the hemaggutinin 1 domain only, particularly <b>within</b> <b>or</b> <b>proximal</b> to the receptor binding sites and antigenic site of the virus. Furthermore, 23 % of the 77 isolates had undergone a MDCK-induced missense mutation, D 151 G/N, in the neuraminidase segment. This mutation {{has been found to be}} associated with reduced drug sensitivity towards the neuraminidase inhibitors and increased viral receptor binding efficiency to host cells. In contrast, none of the neuraminidase sequences obtained directly from the clinical samples contained the D 151 G/N mutation, suggesting that this mutation may be an indicator of MDC...|$|E
40|$|NanGIR 1 is {{a member}} of a new class of group I ribozymes whose {{putative}} biological function is site-specific hydrolysis at an internal processing site (IPS). We have previously shown that NanGIR 1 requires 1 M KCl for maximal activity, which is nevertheless slow (0. 03 min(- 1)). We used in vitro selection and an RNA pool with approximately nine mutations per molecule to select for faster hydrolysis at the IPS in 100 mM KCl. After eight rounds of selection, GIR 1 variants were isolated that catalyzed hydrolysis at 300 -fold greater rates than NanGIR 1 RNA. Although not required by the selection, many of the resultant RNAs had increased thermal stability relative to the parent RNA, and had a more compact structure as evidenced by their faster migration in native gels. Although a wide spectrum of mutations was found in generation 8 clones, only two mutations, U 149 C and U 153 C, were common to greater than 95 % of the molecules. These and one other mutation, G 32 A, are sufficient to increase activity 50 -fold. All three mutations lie <b>within</b> <b>or</b> <b>proximal</b> to the P 15 pseudoknot, a structural signature of GIR 1 RNAs that was previously shown to be important for catalytic activity. Overall, our findings show that variants of the Naegleria GIR 1 ribozyme with dramatically improved activity lie very close to the natural GIR 1 in sequence space.

Previous studies have identified {{a limited number of}} miRNAs expressed by herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV- 1 and - 2), some of which are conserved between these two viruses. To more comprehensively analyze the miRNAs expressed by HSV- 1 or HSV- 2 during productive and latent infection, we applied a massively parallel sequencing approach. We were able to identify 16 and 17 miRNAs expressed by HSV- 1 and HSV- 2, respectively, including all previously known species, and a number of previously unidentified virus-encoded miRNAs. The genomic positions of most miRNAs encoded by these two viruses are <b>within</b> <b>or</b> <b>proximal</b> to the latency-associated transcript region. Nine miRNAs are conserved in position and/or sequence, particularly in the seed region, between these two viruses. Interestingly, we did not detect an HSV- 2 miRNA homolog of HSV- 1 miR-H 1, which is highly expressed during productive infection, but we did detect abundant expression of miR-H 6, whose seed region is conserved with HSV- 1 miR-H 1 and might represent a functional analog. We also identified a highly conserved miRNA family arising from the viral origins of replication. In addition, we detected several pairs of complementary miRNAs and we found miRNA-offset RNAs (moRs) arising from the precursors of HSV- 1 and HSV- 2 miR-H 6 and HSV- 2 miR-H 4.

Previously, the breakpoints of two albino (c) deletions (c 14 CoS and c 1 FAFyh) that genetically define hsdr- 1 were localized, on a long-range map, {{in the vicinity of the}} distal breakpoint of a viable albino deletion (c 24 R 75 M) that breaks proximally within the c locus. Here we report the use of a probe derived from a deletion breakpoint fusion fragment cloned from c 24 R 75 M/c 24 R 75 M DNA to clone a breakpoint fusion fragment caused by the c 14 CoS deletion. The proximal breakpoint of the c 14 CoS deletion was discovered to disrupt a gene (Fah) encoding fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase, the last enzyme in the tyrosine degradation pathway. All of the extant c deletions eliciting the hsdr- 1 phenotype prevent expression of the Fah gene in the liver, and all but one disrupt the coding segment of the gene. Therefore, the Fah gene maps <b>within</b> <b>or</b> <b>proximal</b> to the hsdr- 1 locus, as defined by deletion breakpoints, and disruption of this gene may be partially or completely responsible for the phenotypes associated with the hsdr- 1 deletion syndrome. These mouse mutants may also provide models for the human genetic disorder hereditary tyrosinemia, which is associated with fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase deficiency and liver and kidney dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|The CD 4 {{binding site}} (CD 4 bs) on the HIV- 1 {{envelope}} {{plays a major}} role in determining the capacity of R 5 viruses to infect primary macrophages. Thus, envelope determinants <b>within</b> <b>or</b> <b>proximal</b> to the CD 4 bs have been shown to control the use of low CD 4 levels on macrophages for infection. These residues affect the affinity for CD 4 either directly or indirectly by altering the exposure of CD 4 contact residues. Here, we describe a single amino acid determinant in the V 1 loop that also modulates macrophage tropism. Thus, we identified an E 153 G substitution that conferred high levels of macrophage infectivity for several heterologous R 5 envelopes, while the reciprocal G 153 E substitution abrogated infection. Shifts in macrophage tropism were associated with dramatic shifts in sensitivity to the V 3 loop monoclonal antibody (MAb), 447 - 52 D and soluble CD 4, as well as more modest changes in sensitivity to the CD 4 bs MAb, b 12. These observations are consistent with an altered conformation or exposure of the V 3 loop that enables the envelope to use low CD 4 levels for infection. The modest shifts in b 12 sensitivity suggest that residue 153 impacts on the exposure of the CD 4 bs. However, the more intense shifts in sCD 4 sensitivity suggest additional mechanisms that likely include an increased ability of the envelope to undergo conformational changes following binding to suboptimal levels of cell surface CD 4. In summary, we show that a conserved determinant in the V 1 loop modulates the V 3 loop to prime low CD 4 use and macrophage infection...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Protein {{arginine}} methylation is a {{post-translational modification}} involved in important biological {{processes such as}} transcription and RNA processing. This modification is catalyzed by both type I and II protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs). One of the most conserved type I PRMTs is PRMT 1, the homolog of which is Hmt 1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Hmt 1 {{has been shown to}} play a role in various gene expression steps, such as promoting the dynamics of messenger ribonucleoprotein particle (mRNP) biogenesis, pre-mRNA splicing, and silencing of chromatin. To determine the full extent of Hmt 1 ’s involvement during gene expression, we carried out a genome-wide location analysis for Hmt 1. Results A comprehensive genome-wide binding profile for Hmt 1 was obtained by ChIP-chip using NimbleGen high-resolution tiling microarrays. Of the approximately 1000 Hmt 1 -binding sites found, the majority fall <b>within</b> <b>or</b> <b>proximal</b> to an ORF. Different occupancy patterns of Hmt 1 across genes with different transcriptional rates were found. Interestingly, Hmt 1 occupancy is found at a number of other genomic features such as tRNA and snoRNA genes, thereby implicating a regulatory role in the biogenesis of these non-coding RNAs. RNA hybridization analysis shows that Hmt 1 loss-of-function mutants display higher steady-state tRNA abundance relative to the wild-type. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that Hmt 1 interacts with the TFIIIB component Bdp 1, suggesting a mechanism for Hmt 1 in modulating RNA Pol III transcription to regulate tRNA production. Conclusions The genome-wide binding profile of Hmt 1 reveals multiple potential new roles for Hmt 1 in the control of eukaryotic gene expression, especially in the realm of non-coding RNAs. The data obtained here will provide an important blueprint for future mechanistic studies on the described occupancy relationship for genomic features bound by Hmt 1. </p...|$|E

In two families of Lebanese and Italian origin presenting with NLSD-M, we identified two new missense mutations in highly conserved regions of ATGL (p. Arg 221 Pro and p. Asn 172 Lys) and a novel nonsense mutation (p. Trp 8 X). The Lebanese patients harbor homozygous p. Arg 221 Pro, whereas the Italian patients are heterozygotes for p. Asn 172 Lys and the p. Trp 8 X mutation. The p. Trp 8 X mutation {{results in a}} complete absence of ATGL protein, while the p. Arg 221 Pro and p. Asn 172 Lys mutations result in proteins with minimal lipolytic activity. Although these mutations did not affect putative catalytic residues or the lipid droplet (LD) -binding domain of ATGL, cytosolic LDs accumulated in cultured skin fibroblasts from the patients. The missense mutations might destabilize a random coil (p. Asn 172 Lys) or a helix (p. Arg 221 Pro) structure <b>within</b> <b>or</b> <b>proximal</b> to the patatin domain of the lipase, thereby interfering with the enzyme activity, while leaving intact the residues required to localize the protein to LDs. Overexpressing wild-type ATGL in one patients fibroblasts corrected the metabolic defect and effectively reduced the number and area of cellular LDs. Despite the poor lipase activity in vitro, the Lebanese siblings have a mild myopathy and not clinically evident myocardial dysfunction. The patients of Italian origin show a late-onset and slowly progressive skeletal myopathy. These findings suggest that {{a small amount of}} correctly localized lipase activity preserves cardiac function in NLSD-M...|$|E

CTX was positively related to bone strength as reflected by the strength-strain index (SSI) (β= 0. 09 [0. 03, 0. 14]). To examine the causal nature of this relationship, we then analyzed whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within key osteoclast regulatory genes, known to reduce areal/cortical BMD, conversely increase PC. Fifteen such genetic variants <b>within</b> <b>or</b> <b>proximal</b> to genes encoding receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK), RANK ligand (RANKL), and osteoprotegerin (OPG) were identified by literature search. Six of the 15 alleles that were inversely related to BMD were positively related to CTX (p<} 0. 05 cut-off) (n= 2379). Subsequently, we performed a meta-analysis of associations between these SNPs and PC in ALSPAC (n= 3382), Gothenburg Osteoporosis and Obesity Determinants (GOOD) (n= 938), and the Young Finns Study (YFS) (n= 1558). Five of the 15 alleles that were inversely related to BMD were positively related to PC (p{< 0. 05 cut-off). We conclude that despite having lower BMD, individuals with a genetic predisposition to higher bone resorption have greater bone size, suggesting that higher bone resorption is permissive for greater periosteal expansion...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cannabis {{dependence}} (CaD) and component {{behaviors of}} personality are highly heritable, but the genetic {{basis of these}} traits is poorly understood. Since several attributes of personality (e. g. neuroticism) are strongly correlated with cannabis use, we hypothesized that specific combined genetic underpinnings contribute to both CaD and to certain aspects of personality. METHODS: Personality was quantified with the Revised NEO Personality Inventory that asked questions from the five personality domains. Personality information was acquired from 1931 African Americans (AAs) and 1517 European Americans (EAs). CaD was measured as a summation of the seven binary DSM-IV diagnosis symptoms within a separate set of 1311 AAs and 2752 EAs in the NIH-funded "Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment" (SAGE). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were performed after filtering out single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with low minor allele frequency (MAF) and poor imputation quality. The personality trait {{was used as the}} outcome in the primary data set while CaD was used in the SAGE data set. Meta-analysis was used to combine the results for both traits within and across ethnic groups. Additionally, while honing in on the personality / CaD comparison, the analysis further investigated component facets of the NEO domain most strongly correlated to CaD. RESULTS: Genome-wide significant (GWS) results were obtained for EAs from the bivariate analysis of CaD paired with the extraversion domain (rs 12534830, p= 1. 73 E- 08) near SEMA 3 D and paired with the vulnerability to stress facet, which is a component of the neuroticism domain (rs 76021834, p= 1. 58 E- 08) within POR. GWS association was also observed with the vulnerability to stress facet considered as a single outcome in a SNP within the solute carrier gene SLC 35 F 3 (rs 12047995, p= 3. 55 E- 08) in the combined sample of AAs and EAs. DISCUSSION: Notable associations with both CaD and several personality traits include SNPs from multiple semaphorin genes whose protein products are axonal growth cone guidance molecules. These SNPs were either <b>within</b> <b>or</b> <b>proximal</b> to SEMA 3 A, SEMA 3 D, SEMA 6 A, or SEMA 6 D, which have links to schizophrenia, as discussed in many other studies. Further investigation in independent data sets is warranted to confirm the validity of these findings...|$|E
40|$|Around {{thirty years}} ago HIV- 1 was identified, and from that point the known {{epidemic}} has grown to over 30 million infected individuals. Early on {{in the course of}} HIV- 1 research, viruses were classified as either syncytia inducing, CXCR 4 -using, T-cell tropic or non-syncytia inducing, CCR 5 -using, macrophage tropic. Since that time, several groups have shown that this is an oversimplification. There {{is a great deal of}} diversity amongst CCR 5 -using HIV- 1 variants. There remains a great deal to be discovered regarding HIV- 1 CCR 5 -tropism and how this affects other aspects of HIV- 1 infection. The CD 4 binding site (CD 4 bs) on the HIV- 1 envelope plays a major role in determining the capacity of R 5 viruses to infect primary macrophages. Thus, envelope determinants <b>within</b> <b>or</b> <b>proximal</b> to the CD 4 bs have been shown to control the use of low CD 4 levels on macrophages for infection. These residues affect the affinity for CD 4 either directly or indirectly by altering the exposure of CD 4 contact residues. In this thesis, a single amino acid determinant is described in the V 1 loop that also modulates macrophage tropism. I identified an E 153 G substitution that conferred high levels of macrophage infectivity for several heterologous R 5 envelopes, while the reciprocal G 153 E substitution abrogated infection. Shifts in macrophage tropism were associated with dramatic shifts in sensitivity to the V 3 loop monoclonal antibody (MAb), 447 - 52 D and soluble CD 4, as well as more modest changes in sensitivity to the CD 4 bs MAb, b 12. These observations are consistent with an altered conformation or exposure of the V 3 loop that enables the envelope to use low CD 4 levels for infection. The modest shifts in b 12 sensitivity suggest that residue 153 impacts on the exposure of the CD 4 bs. However, the more intense shifts in sCD 4 sensitivity suggest additional mechanisms that likely include an increased ability of the envelope to undergo conformational changes following binding to suboptimal levels of cell surface CD 4. In summary, a conserved determinant in the V 1 loop modulates the V 3 loop to prime low CD 4 use and macrophage infection. In addition to determinants, this thesis seeks to evaluate the roles of macrophage tropic and non-macrophage tropic envelopes during the course of infection. Non-macrophage tropic virus predominates in immune tissue throughout infection, even in individuals suffering from HIV-associated dementia (HAD) who are known to carry many macrophage tropic viruses. There must be some advantage for these non-macrophage tropic viruses allowing them to persist in immune tissue throughout the disease. This thesis demonstrates that there is no advantage for these viruses to directly infect CD 4 + T-cells, nor is there an advantage for them to be preferentially transmitted by dendritic cells to CD 4 + T-cells. Given that transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses may preferentially interact with α 4 β 7, and T/F viruses are non-macrophage tropic, I tested whether non-mac viruses could utilize α 4 β 7 to their advantage. These experiments show that macrophage tropism does not play a role in gp 120 interactions with α 4 β 7. I evaluated whether there was a distinct disadvantage to macrophage tropic Envs, given their ability to infect dendritic cells and possibly stimulate the innate immune response. Using infected monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs), it was shown that mac-tropic Envs do not generate a significant immune response. These experiments demonstrate that there does not appear to be any advantage to non-macrophage tropic Envs, and that macrophage tropic Envs are able to infect CD 4 + T-cells more efficiently, as well as DCs...|$|E
