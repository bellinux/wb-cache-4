5|$|In February 1991, Icke {{visited a}} pre-Inca Sillustani burial ground near Puno, Peru, where he felt {{drawn to a}} {{particular}} circle of waist-high stones. As {{he stood in the}} circle, he had two thoughts: that people would be talking about this in 100 years, {{and that it would be}} over <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>rained.</b> His body shook as though plugged into an electrical socket, he wrote, and new ideas poured into him. Then it started raining and the experience ended. He described it as the kundalini (a term from Indian yoga) activating his chakras, or energy centres, triggering a higher level of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|The {{roads were}} just prairie trails which wound around bluffs, {{up and down}} hills. These roads were quite {{adequate}} for horses, but were a different story for cars; {{very few of the}} roads went on the square where the roads allowances were finally surveyed. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>rained</b> there was always a mud puddle at the bottom of every hill and every car that went through made the ruts deeper and deeper until you were stuck. The coming of cars soon made a big difference. The prairie trails proved inadequate and road allowances were graded and built up; culverts had to be installed where the natural water runs were. The new graded roads were a big improvement but many a muddy mile was driven over the country roads. Gradually, some of the main highways would get some gravel and it was quite a pleasure to pull of a muddy country road on to a few miles of gravel—Les Moffatt.|$|E
5|$|Sixty {{members and}} {{associates}} of the Breen, Graves, Reed, Murphy, Keseberg, and Eddy families {{set up for}} the winter at Truckee Lake. Three widely separated cabins of pine logs served as their homes, with dirt floors and poorly constructed flat roofs that leaked <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>rained.</b> The Breens occupied one cabin, the Eddys and Murphys another, and Reeds and Graveses the third. Keseberg built a lean-to for his family {{against the side of the}} Breen cabin. The families used canvas or oxhide to patch the faulty roofs. The cabins had no windows or doors, only large holes to allow entry. Of the 60 at Truckee Lake, 19 were men over 18, 12 were women, and 29 were children, 6 of whom were toddlers or younger. Farther down the trail, close to Alder Creek, the Donner families hastily constructed tents to house 21 people, including Mrs. Wolfinger, her child, and the Donners' drivers: 6 men, 3 women, and 12 children in all. It began to snow again on the evening of November 4—the beginning of a storm that lasted 8 days.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} programme {{moved to the}} University of Exeter in 1982, where the C1 chassis was fitted with fibreglass shells and tested in a wind tunnel. It was recognised {{at an early stage}} that the vehicle would have to be aerodynamic; although it was only ever intended to be small and relatively slow, reducing wind resistance was seen as essential for the vehicle's efficiency. By March 1982 the basic design of the C1 had been established. Sinclair then turned to an established motor design company, Ogle Design of Letchworth, to provide professional styling assistance and production engineering. However, Ogle's approach was not to Sinclair's liking; they tackled the project as one of car design and focused more (and expensively) on the aerodynamics rather than the cycle technology around which the C1 was based. The weight of the vehicle increased to over , far more than Sinclair's desired specification. By March 1983, Sinclair and Wood Rogers had decided to stop the C1 programme. Wood Rogers comments that Ogle were convinced that the C1 would be a flop, telling Sinclair {{that it would not be}} fast enough, that its drivers would get wet <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>rained</b> and that the battery was not good enough.|$|E

25|$|The post-war Industrial {{plans for}} Germany set out rules that governed which {{industries}} Germany {{was allowed to}} retain. These rules set German car production at a maximum of 10% of 1936 car production. By 1946, the factory produced 1,000 cars a month—a remarkable feat considering {{it was still in}} disrepair. Owing to roof and window damage, production had to stop <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>rained,</b> and the company had to barter new vehicles for steel for production.|$|E

25|$|They {{remained}} in regular service until {{the closure of}} the inland routes during 1963. The fleet was reduced to eight and renumbered 600–607, with 229, 231, 232 and 234 being mothballed and scrapped in 1968. In the early 1990s the boats were refurbished and received new liveries, including AEC Routemaster red, blue and yellow and a fictitious wartime livery. Two were experimentally converted from trolley pole to pantograph conductors but they were soon converted back as passengers complained at being showered by grease and dirt from the power line <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>rained.</b>|$|E
25|$|Honours in {{this group}} went to South Africa, who started off against Northern Ireland. The Irish had reached 89/5 from 38.1 overs <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>rained,</b> and the Duckworth–Lewis method was used to {{calculate}} a target of 131 from 38 overs for the South Africans, who won by making 133/6. South Africa then bowled out Bangladesh for a paltry 79 and made 80/5 for a five-wicket victory, before rounding things off against Barbados. The Barbadians set a useful 254/6 (Wallace 74), but 71 from Kallis and 54 from Gibbs saw their opponents through to 257/6 with ten balls remaining.|$|E

25|$|The water lei tai {{was held}} on the {{afternoon}} of the second day of competition (May 23). There were five divisions and it was the most attended event of the tournament. The event was made more difficult <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>rained</b> just prior to the matches, making the fighting surface very slippery. Also fighters were restricted to minimal safety equipment, only gloves and shorts. The defeated, who fell or was forced off the stage, landed in water. To improve safety, the lei tai was a meter shorter than a standard one, which lessened the impact and allowed assistants to quickly jump in the pool to rescue any fighter who might have been unconscious. No serious injuries were recorded during this event.|$|E
25|$|In {{the western}} neighborhoods of the city, near the Champs Élysées, the streets, mostly {{built in the}} 17th and 18th centuries, were {{reasonably}} wide and straight. A very few, including the Chausée d'Antin and the rue de l'Odéon, had sidewalks, which had first been introduced into Paris in 1781. The Paris streets {{in the center and}} east of the city, with few exceptions, were narrow, twisting, and confined by high rows of houses, sometimes six or seven stories high, which blocked the light. They had no sidewalks, and had a narrow channel down the center with served as a sewer and storm drain. Pedestrians were compelled to compete with traffic {{in the center of the}} street. The streets often covered with a thick mud, which clung to shoes and clothing. The mud was mixed with the excrement of the horses who pulled wagons and carriages. A particular Paris profession, the decrotteur, had appeared; men who were expert at scraping mud from shoes. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>rained</b> entrepreneurs put planks over the mud, and charged pedestrians to pass over them.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{attempts}} were made by Joseph Joffre, Sir Douglas Haig, Ferdinand Foch and the army commanders Henry Rawlinson and Émile Fayolle to co-ordinate joint attacks, which failed due to {{the recovery of the}} German 2nd Army from the disorganisation caused by the defeats in early July, disagreements over tactics by Haig and Joffre in July and August and organisational constraints, caused by congestion behind the front, roads and tracks obliterated by Anglo-French artillery-fire becoming swamps <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>rained</b> and increasing German artillery-fire on targets behind the front line. Inexperience, unreliable machinery, guns, ammunition and an unpredictable flow of supplies from Britain, reduced the effectiveness of the British armies. Difficulty in co-ordinating attacks by the Allied armies and the large number of piecemeal attacks resorted to by the British, have been criticised as costly failures and evidence of muddle and incompetence by Haig and Rawlinson. The French Sixth and Tenth armies had similar difficulties and severe strain had been put on the German 2nd and 1st armies, forcing them into a similar piecemeal defence.|$|E

500|$|Depots were {{established}} inland {{rather than in}} the vicinity of the port because the Japanese threatened a landing on the coast. A [...] speed limit was imposed to minimise damage to the main road. This was covered with [...] of dust that turned to mud <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>rained.</b> The surface soon broke up under heavy military traffic. The road was only wide enough to allow for one-way traffic and had a number of hairpin bends that required 3-ton trucks to make three-point turns. The 10th Advanced Ordnance Depot was established at 17 Mile in prefabricated huts, erected by Papuan labour, while the 8th Advanced Ammunition Depot handled the ammunition depots at 12 Mile and 19 Mile. In the crisis days of early 1942 some [...] of ammunition was dumped where it was unloaded off the trucks and covered with tarpaulins, with only one storeman on hand to receive it. Soon, no one knew what lay under the tarpaulins. This was hard to rectify as there was an acute shortage of ordnance personnel due to the low priority accorded to service units. The 19 Mile site was poor and a new depot was developed on a better site at 12 Mile.|$|E
500|$|Following the defeat, the England {{selectors}} {{made several}} {{changes for the}} fourth Test; both Barnes and Jessop were left out. MacLaren favoured Jessop's inclusion but the selectors considered him unreliable. Although Barnes was not fully fit, later commentators suggested the selectors omitted him because of MacLaren's actions at Sheffield. A further player {{was added to the}} squad in case the pitch was affected by rain before the match, but rather than choosing Haigh, the leading wet-pitch bowler in the country, Hawke insisted that Sussex's Fred Tate was included—critics have suggested that Hawke wanted to prevent Haigh's absence from the Yorkshire team, of which Hawke was captain, given the unlikeliness of the extra bowler being needed. According to the cricket writer Neville Cardus, when MacLaren saw the list of players in the team, he responded: [...] "My God, look what they've sent me". MacLaren was angry with Hawke, and <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>rained</b> before the match, included Tate in the final eleven at the expense of George Hirst, a leading all-rounder. Gibson suggests that Tate was only included by the selectors [...] "because they thought MacLaren could not possibly pick him" [...] and so he could not make any further late changes to the team; MacLaren, according to Gibson, in turn included Tate out of spite. Other writers have suggested that MacLaren, as a Lancastrian, preferred a Sussex player to a Yorkshire one.|$|E

Arguments during the recording sessions led to what [...] "most reductively boils down to Wentz writing the lyrics and Stump writing the melodies." ...|$|E
