2500|$|Erecting the {{structure}} demanded precise calculations. The standards for cable structure construction {{required that the}} engineers create a strategy of execution, documenting each step, prior to construction. In order for {{the structure}} to be erected, much shoring and preliminary bracing was done to relieve the dead load from the gravity columns prior to cable installation. Geiger Engineers devised a plan in which the perimeter columns were erected first, after which the concrete planks and roof framing were placed, followed by the erection of the masts, and lastly the installation of each cable. The concrete planks on the roof sit on steel framing, including the large longitudinal girders that create the swooping form of the roof. These girders were fabricated with W36x300s {{in the middle of}} the W27x194s at the sides. All of the <b>wide</b> <b>flange</b> shapes and masts were fabricated form ASTM A572 Grade 50 steel, while the diagonal roof bracing were A 500 Grade B. [...] Due to the precisely choreographed steel design, the Flushing Meadow Natatorium received the 2009 Innovative Design in Engineering and Architecture with Structural Steel award. (IDEAS2). The IDEAS2 awards recognize outstanding achievements in engineering and architecture on structural steel projects around the country. The project was judged on structural steel innovation, with an emphasis on creative solutions to project requirements. The form was directly derived from the structural requirements of the program.|$|E

5000|$|The {{main problem}} with a train on tram rails is the {{relatively}} narrow width of frog and switch gaps and channels of the groove rails designed to accommodate the narrow flanges of tram wheels [...] The <b>wider</b> <b>flanges</b> of train wheels {{increase the risk of}} derailment at these points. On routes where train carriages are driven on tram tracks (as in the past in parts of The Hague), wider grooves are required as a compromise that is practical as wide grooved girder rail is available.

The usually or normally limited structure gauge, and tight curves, on tram tracks will also prevent trains from using tram tracks.|$|R

40|$|A {{study on}} {{buckling}} phenomena in pultruded Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) beams, {{based on two}} mechanical models recently formulated by the authors with regard to composite thin-walled beams, is presented in this paper. Global buckling behavior is analyzed {{by means of a}} one-dimensional model in which cross-section torsional rotation is divided into two parts: the first one, associated with Vlasov’s axial warping, the second one, associated entirely with shear strains. The study of local behavior is based on the individual buckling analysis of the components of FRP profile, assumed as elastically restrained transversely isotropic plates. Both mechanical models take into account, within the field of small strains and moderate rotations, the contribution of shear deformation in the kinematic hypotheses. Design charts suitable to evaluate the buckling load of FRP “I” beams with either narrow or <b>wide</b> <b>flanges</b> are obtained and presented in this paper...|$|R
5000|$|The 105 format was {{introduced}} by Kodak in 1898 for their first folding camera and was the original 6×9 cm format roll film. The 117 format {{was introduced}} by Kodak in 1900 for their first Brownie camera, the No.1 Brownie, 6×6 cm format.

The 105 and 620 spools also have much thinner flanges than the 117 and 120 spools (0.025 inch vs. 0.060 inch); as a result, an unmodified 120 spool will not fit a camera designed for 105 film, such as a No. 1 Folding Pocket Kodak, as the overall length between {{the outside of the}} flanges is too long to fit the width of the film chamber.|$|R

The shear forces from the vehicle wheel loads in the deck of this innovative bridge are designed to be carried by restrained membrane action without using reinforcing in the concrete.

50|$|Early locomotive-powered {{railways}} {{had used}} short cast iron rails carried on stone blocks. A few were trying timber sleepers {{to support the}} rails and to maintain the gauge between them. These rails were brittle and broke easily, and they gave a rough ride due {{to the difficulty of}} maintaining a smooth line between the blocks or sleepers. Wrought iron rails were being manufactured but they were of poor quality due to the difficulty of cooling them evenly during manufacture. Brunel decided to use a continuously supported wrought iron rail, a bridge rail with a smaller rail section that cooled more evenly. This was an inverted-U section with <b>wide</b> <b>flanges</b> that could be bolted to the timber bearer, which was known as a 'longitudinal' baulk. The rail was usually kept off this by small wooden packing pieces that could be replaced when they were worn out by the passage of the trains, and therefore avoid the expense of replacing the heavier longitudinals. The rails were bolted to the longitudinals by long fang bolts or coach screws, and the rail joints were later supported by a base plate formed with a plug in the void of the inverted U shape rails so as to keep the rails in line with each other.|$|R
40|$|Shear lag occurs {{not only}} in bridge decks and framed tubes, but also in shear/core walls. However, there have been {{relatively}} few studies on shear lag in wall structures. Moreover, most existing theories neglect shear lag in the webs and, although they are acceptable for bridge decks that normally have <b>flanges</b> <b>wider</b> than webs, {{they may not be}} applicable to shear/core walls whose webs can be much <b>wider</b> than <b>flanges.</b> To study the shear lag phenomenon in wall structures, a parametric study using finite-element analysis is carried out. Unlike previous studies that neglected shear lag in the webs, many layers of elements are used for both the webs and flanges so that shear lag in the webs can also be taken into account. The results indicate that the shape of the longitudinal stress distribution in an individual web or flange panel is quite independent of the dimensions of the other panels. Based on this observation, design charts and empirical formulas for estimating the shear lag effects are developed for practical applications. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
