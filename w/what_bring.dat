According to Maré, “tragedies are <b>what</b> <b>bring</b> it out in people, but people really understand kindness at a different level, they understand kindness is not a soft issue, that it’s not a fluffy thing, that it’s not a weakness.

50|$|Presentation of mood repair {{strategies}} {{has been}} {{the primary focus of}} much of the research studying the efficacy of mood repair strategies. The initial thing to consider when proposing the use of a mood repair strategy is what kind of state the unhappy individual is in. If the individual is depressed, avoidance framed messages have been shown to have the greatest influence on increasing mood. This means that presenting mood repair strategies {{in such a way that}} they do not seem like they are attempting to achieve happiness, but rather to avoid sadness, are more effective. Individuals who are not clinically depressed respond better to approach framed messages of mood repair. These individuals are usually more interested in achieving happiness. Individual’s perceptions of the desirability of mood change and the likelihood that a strategy may work are <b>what</b> <b>bring</b> about success.|$|E
50|$|There {{are five}} main types of {{structural}} components {{that make up}} a steel frame - tension members, compression members, bending members, combined force members and their connections. Tension members are usually found as web and chord members in trusses and open web steel joists. Ideally tension members carry tensile forces, or pulling forces, only and its end connections are assumed to be pinned. Pin connections prevent any moment(rotation) or shear forces from being applied to the member. Compression members are also considered as columns, struts, or posts. They are vertical members or web and chord members in trusses and joists that are in compression or being squished. Bending members are also known as beams, girders, joists, spandrels, purlins, lintels, and girts. Each of these members have their own structural application, but typically bending members will carry bending moments and shear forces as primary loads and axial forces and torsion as secondary loads. Combined force members are commonly known as beam-columns and are subjected to bending and axial compression.Connections are <b>what</b> <b>bring</b> the entire building together. They join these members together and must ensure that they function together as one unit.|$|E

5000|$|M.D. Uroff agrees, {{seeing the}} end of the poem as a {{tentative}} return to health, but also views the poem as an expression of the mind's ability to “generate hyperboles to torture itself.” In other words, he does not want the general interpretation - that the speaker chooses life - to distract from the harshness of her perspective towards life. Barbara Hardy concurs, writing that the tulips are “inhabitants of the bizarre world of private irrational fantasy, even beyond the bridge of distorted science: they contrast with the whiteness of nullity and death, are like a baby, an African cat, are like her wound (a real red physical wound, stitched so as to heal, not to gape like opened tulips) and, finally, like her heart;” yet they, more than anything else, are <b>what</b> <b>bring</b> her back to life. It is safe to assume that without them, she would have remained ensconced in her bed, enjoying her lifelessness. The irony of the tulips is that they save her by torturing her, by forcing her to confront a truth that she otherwise would ignore in favor of the easier lifelessness. What this interpretation implies, then, is that the choice of life is necessarily a difficult and painful one, whereas death is not itself a choice but rather simply a refusal to continue living.Sylvia Plath BiographyThe speaker is in a hospital bed and describes her experience using an image of red tulips (presumably a gift) that interrupt her calm stay in the white hospital.During her stay at the hospital she has given up everything, including her identity, as expressed by the lines:I am nobody; I {{have nothing to do with}} explosions.I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nursesAnd my history to the anaesthetist and my body to surgeons.She wishes to remain in a state of emptiness, but the flowers intrude upon this state:I didn't want any flowers, I only wantedTo lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.Eileen Aird remarks: [...] "The world of Ariel is a black and white one into which red, which represents blood, the heart and living is always an intrusion." [...] Renée R. Curry takes this further by claiming the tulips signify [...] "by their glorious and bold colors, glaring Otherness." ...|$|E

40|$|It {{would be}} nearly {{impossible}} for me to deliver a reasonably documented lecture on the Nabarro-Hart-Rivlin connection. I concluded this after deciding on my talk’s title; wishful but not realistic. Fortunately, Ali Argon’s lecture which follows will make up, in part, for this inadequacy. I will refer, thus, only to some personal experiences I had from meetings and discussions with them. I first met Hart in 1976 when I was invited for an interview at Cornell, after obtaining my PhD from Minnesota in December 1975. His first question was whether “stress ” or “strain ” is the fundamental variable in solid mechanics. I was educated to treat the strain and/or its rate as independent variables in constitutive equations. Hart’s view was, as in Newtonian mechanics, that forces are <b>what</b> <b>bring</b> geometrical changes about. Nevertheless, a few weeks later, I received phone calls from Ali Argon and Jim Li who invited me for interviews at their schools after Hart had contacted them. My next encounter with Hart, as well as with Nabarro and Rivlin was in 1983 in Houghton/Michigan where all three participated in the Symposium I co-organized with John Hirth on the “Mechanics of Dislocations” celebrating the 50 th anniversary from the first dislocation observation with a dedication to Eshelby. At that meeting I ventured to present some preliminary ideas on the necessity of introducing diffusive-like terms in the evolution equations for dislocation densities when the material is densely populated by these defects, as well a...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The mechanically compressive flow stress sensitivities of various polymers are investigated at high strain rates above 103 s- 1. Temperatures near the glass transition temperature are investigated and the polymer stress-strain responses have been studied from ambient temperature to 100 ºC. Previous work has reported peaks in flow stress {{as a function of}} strain rate [Al-Maliky/Parry 1994, Al-Maliky 1997]. The analyses showed rapid increases of flow stress followed by a sudden drop at elevated strain rates, which is unlike the well known linear relationship documented at the low strain rates. The mechanics and stipulation of <b>what</b> <b>bring</b> about this phenomenon, or the types of polymers influenced are still unclear. Two fluoropolymers, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE), and two vinyl polymers, polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), are chosen for this study. PTFE, PCTFE and PVC are semi-crystalline polymers with different percentage of crystallinity contents, whereas PMMA is an amorphous polymer. The glass transition temperature, Tg, is the characteristic of the amorphous content in polymers, which has been suggested to influence the flow stress peaks [Swallowe/Lee 2003]. Tg of the semi-crystalline polymers are within the test temperature range. High strain rate compression tests have been carried out using the split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB). This is a well-established method for determining the stress, strain, and strain rate of materials. The strain rate range of interest is 103 s- 1 to 105 s- 1 where the strain rate sensitivity has previously been identified [Al-Maliky/Parry 1994, Al-Maliky 1997, Walley/Field 1994]. Two thermal analyses techniques are used to quantify the dependency of the viscoelastic behaviour in relation to time and temperature. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measures the enthalpy of the polymers to show how the materials are affected by heat, and Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) is used to characterise the time-temperature dependence of the elastic storage and loss moduli of the polymers A total of 42 PCTFE, 44 PTFE, 45 PVC and 55 PMMA specimens were tested using the SHPB system, with the strain rate varying between 1600 s- 1 and 6100 s- 1. Initial results for PMMA have been reported [Forrester/Swallowe 2009]. The rate of strain where specimens begin to show crazing is identified. The value of yield stress increases with the increase of strain rate and the decrease in temperature. Large strain hardening can be seen in all three semi-crystalline polymers at higher strain rates. The temperature rise during plastic flow of compression is calculated by the stress-strain rate curves. In this thesis, the emphasis is on the relation of yield/flow stress to strain rate as the polymers deform under high strain compression. The mechanism behind the cause of high strain rate deformation responses for amorphous to semi-crystalline polymers in ductile state is discussed, with a view to understanding the sensitivity of yield/flow stresses as a function of strain rate. Also, the modelling of the polymers has been carried in order to alleviate doubts about the validity of the real experimental results that may arise {{due to the nature of}} the decomposition of the polymers. It has been shown that the strain energy density pulses through the sample in response to the compression wave in various circular intensities...|$|E
