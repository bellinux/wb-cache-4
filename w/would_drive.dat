5|$|Denver {{used to be}} a major trading {{center for}} beef and {{livestock}} when ranchers <b>would</b> <b>drive</b> (or later transport) cattle to the Denver Union Stockyards for sale. As a celebration of that history, {{for more than a century}} Denver has hosted the annual National Western Stock Show, attracting as many as 10,000 animals and 700,000 attendees. The show is held every January at the National Western Complex northeast of downtown.|$|E
5|$|Prinzregent Luitpold was {{equipped}} with two sets of Parsons turbines on the outer shafts. It was intended that a single 12,000bhp Germania 6-cylinder 2-stroke diesel engine <b>would</b> <b>drive</b> the center shaft. However, the diesel power plant was not ready in time to be installed in Prinzregent Luitpold, so the ship sailed with only two shafts. On trials, Prinzregent Luitpold was approximately one half knot slower than her sisters.|$|E
5|$|The Association {{objected to}} the American {{retailer}} Abercrombie & Fitch's plan to open a children's store at 3 Savile Row, concerned that chain stores entering the street <b>would</b> <b>drive</b> up rents, and took part in, what was then, a successful protest in 2012. However, A were allowed to move in {{and set up a}} children's store in 2013. A again attracted criticism in January 2015 for its store's colour scheme: brown.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{forms of}} optical modules had an analog NRZ electrical interface. In the transmit direction, the optical module <b>would</b> directly <b>drive</b> the laser or LED with the analog signal {{coming from the}} front system card. In the receive direction, the module <b>would</b> directly <b>drive</b> the receive electrical interface with {{the output of the}} analog optical-to-electrical receiver circuit.|$|R

5|$|The {{film was}} shot in Bagnoregio, Viterbo, Lazio, and Ovindoli, L'Aquila, Abruzzo. On Sundays, Fellini and Basehart <b>would</b> <b>drive</b> around the countryside, {{scouting}} locations and looking {{for just the right}} place to eat, sometimes trying as many as six restaurants and venturing as far away as Rimini before Fellini could find the desired ambience and menu.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} changes of driver before the race. Red Bull Racing Team {{announced}} regular driver A. J. Allmendinger {{would be replaced}} by Mike Skinner who <b>would</b> <b>drive</b> at Talladega, and by former Scuderia Torro Rosso, Formula One driver Scott Speed who <b>would</b> <b>drive</b> in the seven remaining races of the season. Red Bull Racing {{vice president and general}} manager Jay Frye said this change would allow the Red Bull Racing Team to continue its development for the future. Kenny Wallace took over from Michael McDowell in the No. 00 Michael Waltrip Racing car at Talladega, because the team decided to regroup after he failed to qualify the previous race weekend at Kansas Speedway. Richard Childress Racing fielded a fourth car driven by Nationwide Series driver Mike Wallace.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} on, the North Korean {{government}} became more aggressive, and skirmishes between {{troops of the}} North and South became common. UN military observers were assigned to monitor the situation and prevent it from escalating. United Nations General Assembly Resolution 293, passed October 21, 1949, recognized only South Korea's government as legal. For its part, North Korea issued inflammatory responses to the UN denying the legality of UN activities in Korea and saying it <b>would</b> <b>drive</b> the UN out of the country.|$|E

5|$|In {{reaction}} to the seizure of the American vessels, Congress debated and approved the Naval Act of 1794, which authorized the building of six frigates, four of 44 guns and two of 36 guns. Supporters were mostly from the northern states and the coastal regions, who argued the Navy would result in savings in insurance and ransom payments, while opponents from southern states and inland regions thought a navy was not worth the expense and <b>would</b> <b>drive</b> the United States into more costly wars.|$|E
5|$|Momolo {{came home}} to find the {{apartment}} empty apart from Vitta, Marianna's brother (also called Angelo Padovani), the two policemen and Edgardo himself. At about 20:00 the carabinieri arrived, in two carriages—one for Lucidi and his men, and another in which Agostini <b>would</b> <b>drive</b> Edgardo. Lucidi entered the apartment and took Edgardo from his father's arms, prompting the two policemen who had guarded him to shed tears. Momolo followed the police {{down the stairs to}} the street, then fainted. Edgardo was passed to Agostini and driven away.|$|E
5|$|Pearson ran {{a partial}} season in 1967, {{competing}} in 22 of 48 races. He began the season racing for Cotton Owens before switching after the thirteenth race to Holman Moody. Pearson quit after {{there was a}} misunderstanding about who <b>would</b> <b>drive</b> the teams tow truck. Dodge decided to stop racing in NASCAR, so Pearson switched way from Owen's Dodges in favor of Holman Moody's Fords. He had two wins (Bristol, Greenville-Pickens), both for Owens, in a season that was dominated by Petty's all-time record 27 victories (including all-time record 10 straight). Pearson finished seventh in season points.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} week at Kansas Speedway, Foyt and his teammate Ed Carpenter shared the third row, with Foyt qualifying 5th. It {{was his best}} career start and second top-10 start in a row. In the RoadRunner Turbo Indy 300, Foyt had his chances of a high finish end as his car {{was caught in the}} pits when an accident involving Buddy Rice occurred. Foyt <b>would</b> <b>drive</b> to an eighth-place finish. Foyt's best finish of the season came in the Iowa Corn Indy 250 in June at the Iowa Speedway where he finished fifth. Foyt finished 19th in points.|$|E
5|$|The sensors were {{designed}} for air deployment by either of two means. The first was by parachute, which would hang the devices in trees, where {{they appeared to be}} part of the foliage. The second method was the use of gravity, which <b>would</b> <b>drive</b> the spike-shaped device into the ground like a lawn dart, burying all but their antennae, which {{were designed}} to appear as weeds. Surprisingly, approximately 80 percent of the air-dropped sensors were found to be operational after delivery.|$|E
5|$|There were driver {{changes for}} the race's first free {{practice}} session. Max Verstappen replaced Jean-Éric Vergne {{as part of his}} preparation for a full-time seat at Toro Rosso in 2015. Aged 17 years and three days, Verstappen was the youngest person {{in the history of the}} series to participate in a Formula One race weekend. Caterham confirmed that Roberto Merhi would replace Marcus Ericsson, and Kamui Kobayashi <b>would</b> <b>drive</b> in the race. Formula Renault 3.5 Series driver Will Stevens was announced as participating in the first practice session in Max Chilton's car, but a problem with paperwork sent to the FIA Contract Recognition Board due to an industrial action in Germany prevented him from driving.|$|E

5|$|Wanting {{readers to}} know that the stone mask and its powers would be what <b>would</b> <b>drive</b> the plot, Araki started the manga with a prologue {{involving}} the mask, focusing on communicating the mood, rather than the standard way of opening a manga with an introduction of the protagonist. The concept of the Hamon power was created as he thought about how to create drawings that show the invisible; he {{came up with the idea}} of a character punching a frog, which was left unharmed, while the rock underneath cracked open, thus showing the supernatural power of the character's abilities. It was also influenced by his love for karate manga, with the supernatural moves used within them.|$|E
5|$|A planet {{could also}} be perturbed from a distant {{circular}} orbit into an eccentric orbit by an encounter with another star. The in situ formation of a planet at this distance would require a very massive and extensive disk, or the outward drift of solids in a dissipating disk forming a narrow ring from which the planet accreted over a billion years. If a planet formed at such a great distance while the Sun was in its birth cluster, the probability of it remaining bound to the Sun in a highly eccentric orbit is roughly 10%. A previous paper found that a massive disk extending beyond 80 AU <b>would</b> <b>drive</b> Kozai oscillations of objects scattered outward by Jupiter and Saturn, leaving {{some of them in}} high inclination (inc > 50°), low eccentricity orbits which have not been observed.|$|E
5|$|Augustus' brother, Otto, {{devised the}} scheme to corner United Copper, {{believing that the}} Heinze family already {{controlled}} {{a majority of the}} company. He also believed that a significant number of the Heinze's shares had been borrowed, and sold short, by speculators betting that the stock price would drop, and that they could thus repurchase the borrowed shares cheaply, pocketing the difference. Otto proposed a short squeeze, whereby the Heinzes would aggressively purchase as many remaining shares as possible, and then force the short sellers to pay for their borrowed shares. The aggressive purchasing <b>would</b> <b>drive</b> up the share price, and, being unable to find shares elsewhere, the short sellers would have no option but to turn to the Heinzes, who could then name their price.|$|E

5|$|By August 1942, {{preparations}} were begun {{for a major}} operation, Jubilee, at Dieppe. The Dieppe raid {{took place}} on 19 August 1942. Johnson took off at 07:40 in Spitfire VB. EP254, DW-B. Running into around 50 Bf 109s and Fw 190s in fours, pairs and singly. In a climbing attack Johnson shot down one Fw 190 which crashed into the sea and shared {{in the destruction of}} a Bf 109F. While heading back to base, Johnson attacked an alert Fw 190 which met his attack head on. The dogfight descended from 8,000 to zero feet. Flying over Dieppe, Johnson dived towards a destroyer in the hope its fire <b>would</b> <b>drive</b> off the Fw 190, now on his tail. The move worked and Johnson landed back at RAF West Malling at 09:20. For the remainder of the year, the squadron was moved to RAF Castletown in September 1942 to protect the Royal Navy fleet at Scapa Flow.|$|E
5|$|By the 1920s Abd al-Rahman was a {{respected}} {{religious and political}} leader. In 1921 he held a meeting at his home where the attendees signed two documents that laid out the Mahdist objectives. These were for Sudan to be ruled by Britain rather than Egypt, and for Sudan to eventually achieve self-government. In the early 1920s, between 5,000 and 15,000 pilgrims were coming to Aba Island each year to celebrate Ramadan. Many of them identified Abd al-Rahman with Isa, the prophet Jesus, and assumed that he <b>would</b> <b>drive</b> the Christian colonists out of Sudan. The British found that Abd al-Rahman was in correspondence with agents and leaders in Nigeria and Cameroon, predicting the eventual victory of the Mahdists over the Christians. They blamed him for unrest in these colonies. After pilgrims from West Africa held mass demonstrations on Aba Island in 1924, Abd al-Rahman was told {{to put a stop}} to the pilgrimages.|$|E
5|$|Dean Dull {{initiated}} a {{group known as}} the Ramblin' Wreck Committee of the Student Council to aid in his search for a mascot. When the Wreck was found in 1961, the Ramblin' Wreck Committee was chaired by Dekle Rountree. Rountree <b>would</b> <b>drive</b> the Wreck for school functions and Student Council fundraisers. He {{was also the first}} person to drive the Ramblin' Wreck onto Grant Field. Don Gentry, the president of Reck Club in 1961, was the first student to drive the Wreck as he aided in retrieving the Model A from Ted Johnson's home. The Wreck was always maintained by Reck Club but the complete transition of control occurred between 1964–1967. During this period, Reck Club was relieved of its RAT rules enforcement duties and given more wholesome jobs of maintaining the Wreck, upholding traditions, and generating school spirit.|$|E
