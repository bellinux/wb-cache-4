500|$|... "Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily" [...] was {{the first}} episode to be made after Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein became show runners of The Simpsons. They wanted to start the season with an episode {{centering}} on the Simpson family. The story was pitched by writer George Meyer at a story retreat. Story retreats were held twice a year at a hotel room close to the studio lot, where all the writers gathered to pitch their ideas. Seventeen episodes were pitched at this particular story retreat. Out of them all, Weinstein considered this episode to be the best, and he thought the pitch by Meyer was the best he had ever heard. Oakley and Weinstein selected former full-time staff writer Jon Vitti to write the episode, wanting a [...] "heavy hitter", since it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> the seventh production season. Vitti retained in his script most of what Meyer pitched at the retreat.|$|E

500|$|Koht {{was then}} {{hired as a}} docent at the University in 1908. Because Koht had {{internal}} opponents at the university, the docenture was designated to cover [...] "cultural history" [...] instead of [...] "history". A while later the university changed it to [...] "history". The cabinet changed it back to [...] "cultural history", before the Parliament finally decided on [...] "history". Koht <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> his tenure as a docent, but argued with Waldemar Christofer Br√∏gger that he deserved to travel abroad first. From 1908 to 1909 Koht travelled around in the United States, England and Sweden, visiting the peace conferences in London (1908), Chicago (1909) and Stockholm (1910). During these years, his wife, daughter and her nanny lived in Eidsvoll. Koht then returned to Norway and the university, and remained docent until being promoted to professor in 1910. He remained professor until 1935, and also served as the dean of his Faculty from 1912 to 1917.|$|E
500|$|... "Baby Not on Board" [...] {{was written}} by {{eventual}} series showrunner and executive producer Mark Hentemann, who joined the show as a writer in its third season. It was directed by Julius Wu on his first episode of the season, although he {{would go on to}} direct the episode [...] "420" [...] later in the season. Series regulars Peter Shin and James Purdum served as supervising directors for the episode. The episode marked {{the first time since the}} show's creation that celebrities do not feature wide, circular eyes. The staff wanted to make the celebrities look more realistic in contrast to the regular characters; a good example of this can be seen on Patrick Swayze's character design for the episode. The Standards and Practices had a problem with Peter saying [...] "masturbate", so staff writers edited it to [...] "rub one out". The episode revealed that the character Cleveland Brown <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> in his own show, which turned out to be the Family Guy spin-off, The Cleveland Show, which later premiered in September 2009.|$|E
500|$|The Indians {{played against}} the New York Giants in the 1954 World Series, {{but unlike the}} 1948 Series, Feller did not make an appearance.

If we had won {{the first or second}} game in New York, I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> Feller in Cleveland in the fourth game. But when we didn't (win either game in New York), why in the hell was I going to pitch Feller? He was the fifth starter on the club at that time, and wasn't the Feller he'd been (earlier in his career)." [...] In 1955, Feller spent part of the season as a starter, then was moved to the bullpen later in the season. He won and lost four games each in 25 appearances. During the offseason, he became chairman of the Ohio March of Dimes and served as player representative for the American League. He worked with National League representative Robin Roberts throughout the offseason, discussing the possibility of player arbitration and pensions with baseball owners; he then became president of the Baseball Players' Association.|$|E
