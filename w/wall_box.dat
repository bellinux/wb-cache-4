25|$|It is {{recorded}} in the Post Office archives that the first box in the UK was erected in Botchergate, Carlisle in 1853. This fact is commemorated today with a replica Penfold box, located between the Market Cross and the Old Town Hall, in Carlisle city centre. The first six in London were installed on 11 April 1855. The earliest surviving UK designs are four Butt boxes made in Gloucester for the Western Area. These are at Barnes Cross, near Sherborne, Dorset, inside the former Britannia Royal Naval Hospital in Plymouth, in the Haverfordwest town museum (formerly at Merlin's Bridge) and in the British Postal Museum & Archive store at Debden (formerly at Ventnor railway station, Isle of Wight). All date from 1853â€“59, with Barnes Cross {{being one of the}} later batch. The oldest pillar boxes still in use by the Royal Mail are at Framlingham in Suffolk. This pair were founded by Andrew Handyside and Company of Derby in 1856. They are at Double Street and College Road. A third octagonal pillar of this type was at Gobweston in Lincolnshire and is now in the Museum of Lincolnshire Life in Lincoln. 1856 also saw various designs introduced in Scotland and the Midlands. The postbox believed to be the oldest in Scotland, is a <b>wall</b> <b>box</b> which sits {{on the front of the}} Golspie Inn (formerly the Sutherland Arms Hotel). It carries the Royal Cypher of Queen Victoria and dates back to 1861.|$|E
2500|$|The company {{provides}} {{mail collection}} and delivery services throughout the UK. [...] Letters are deposited in a pillar or <b>wall</b> <b>box,</b> taken to a post office, or collected in bulk from businesses. Deliveries are made at least once every day except Sundays and bank holidays at uniform charges for all UK destinations. Royal Mail generally aims to make first class deliveries the next business day throughout the nation.|$|E
2500|$|In 1849, the Royal Mail first {{encouraged}} {{people to}} install letterboxes {{to facilitate the}} delivery of mail. Before then, letterboxes of a similar design had been installed in the doors and walls of post offices for people to drop off outgoing mail. An {{example of such a}} <b>wall</b> <b>box</b> (originally installed in the wall of the Wakefield Post Office) is dated 1809 and believed to be the oldest example in Britain. [...] It is now on display at the new Wakefield Museum.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wall</b> <b>boxes</b> are {{a type of}} {{post box}} or letter box found in many {{countries}} including France, the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth of Nations, Crown dependencies and Ireland. They differ from pillar boxes in that, {{instead of being a}} free-standing structure, they are generally set into a wall (hence the name) or supported on a free-standing pole, girder or other stable structure. In the UK, UK Dependent Territories, Colonies and former Colonies and in many former British Empire countries, <b>wall</b> <b>boxes</b> usually bear the initials of the reigning monarch at the time the box was made. The first UK <b>wall</b> <b>boxes</b> were erected in 1857 in Shrewsbury and Market Drayton.|$|R

2500|$|The {{majority}} of the goods volume to Zermatt is transported in standard containers, for which bogie and four wheel carrying wagons are available. [...] Freight not transported in containers is loaded at Visp into sliding <b>wall</b> <b>box</b> cars, and later delivered to recipients in Zermatt by electric road vehicles. [...] For non moisture sensitive goods, many open wagons of various types can be used. Oil transport is undertaken in tank cars with either four wheels or bogies. Classic covered wagons play no role in normal traffic any more. [...] During the high season, up to three purely goods trains operate daily in each direction, and goods wagons are also attached to some passenger trains.|$|E

25|$|Mail {{may also}} be {{deposited}} in lamp <b>boxes</b> or <b>wall</b> <b>boxes</b> that serve the same purpose as pillar boxes but are attached to a post or set into a wall. According to the Letter Box Study Group, {{there are more than}} 150 recognised designs and varieties of pillar <b>boxes</b> and <b>wall</b> <b>boxes,</b> not all of which have known surviving examples. The red post box is regarded as a British cultural icon. Royal Mail estimates there are over 100,000 post boxes in the United Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|During {{this long}} reign many {{thousands}} of <b>wall</b> <b>boxes</b> were installed. Of note are the free-standing <b>wall</b> <b>boxes</b> of Size A for use {{on the street and}} the introduction of boxes with rear-opening doors, designated Types D, E and F respectively, for use in sub-post offices. Included in these are the Type E boxes made respectively in:WB106/1 1932 by Andrew Handyside & Co. of DerbyWB106/2 1933 by Derby Castings Ltd.WB106/3 1934-6 by W.T. Allen & Co. Ltd. of London which cause a lot of confusion for those photographing and studying them as they are identical save for the Maker's name on the base which may be obscured by 75 years' worth of paint. All have the larger GR cipher positioned low on the door, whereas earlier GR boxes by W.T. Allen 1910-25 have a smaller cipher set much higher on the door, so that the top of the cipher almost abuts the collection plate holder. Similar difficulties are encountered when trying to identify the corresponding B size <b>wall</b> <b>boxes</b> from this period.|$|R

5000|$|Following the 1922 Partition of Ireland, the Irish Free State {{continued}} to commission foundries to make boxes of similar design to those installed under Colonial rule, {{but without a}} royal cipher and repainted the red boxes in green. Many of these were from the foundry of IVI at Athy, Co. Kildare, who held the contract for several decades. Earlier Irish Free State boxes, such as the large A size box seen below, have the elaborate wreathed harp emblem on the door. However, {{with the formation of}} the Irish Government Department of Posts and Telegraphs, their Gaelic script logo [...] "P&T" [...] (using a Tironian [...] "et" [...] instead of ampersand) began to appear on <b>wall</b> <b>boxes,</b> such as that seen below at Clonmany, Co. Donegal. In recent times the department has become a free-standing commercial organisation known as An Post. No cast iron <b>wall</b> <b>boxes</b> have been made with An Post's wavy line logo, {{but there are plenty of}} sheet steel <b>wall</b> <b>boxes</b> across the Republic bearing adhesive decals or screen printed with An Post's distinctive yellow on green logo.|$|R
50|$|As noted, a few <b>wall</b> <b>boxes</b> are, confusingly, free-standing, such as {{that outside}} Vollams Newsagents (formerly a post-office) in Gloddaeth Street, Llandudno. These large A size boxes were {{designed}} specially to be free-standing and include additionally, a large cast-iron base and an attractive pedimented top surmounted by a ball. A well-known example was situated at Waterloo station in London until removal in the late 1990s and subsequent restoration at the Isle of Wight Postal Museum. In {{other areas of the}} UK, such as East Anglia and the West Country, standard <b>wall</b> <b>boxes</b> have been mounted on steel girders or poles where no suitable wall exists.|$|R

50|$|<b>Wall</b> <b>boxes</b> are {{normally}} made {{of cast iron}} and are fabricated in two large castings with a third casting for the door. The rear part of the box which is set into the wall is cast as one piece, rather like an upright coffin. The whole front of the box including the aperture, royal cipher and the collection plate holder, are cast as one. There is a large opening in the front casting into which a hinged door is inserted. It is {{held in place by}} steel pins at top and bottom which locate into machined holes in the front casting. A secure 5-lever Chubb lock is fitted to all <b>wall</b> <b>boxes</b> made after 1870. Previously, narrower locks from the firm of Nettlefields were used. They are not interchangeable and this causes problems when keys are lost and locks have to be changed.|$|R
