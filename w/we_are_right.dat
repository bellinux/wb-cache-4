A group of volunteer riders called WARBYs (<b>We</b> <b>Are</b> <b>Right</b> Behind You) ride throughout the field, providing emergency assistance for bicycle breakdowns and rider difficulties. A number of sag wagons accompany the ride to pick up riders and bikes {{who are unable to}} continue due to their bicycle being beyond roadside repair, injury, sickness, or general weariness.|$|E
500|$|On November 5, Bryan sent a {{telegram}} of congratulations to McKinley, {{becoming the first}} losing presidential candidate to do so, [...] "Senator Jones has just informed me that the returns indicate your election, and I hasten to extend my congratulations. [...] We have submitted the issues to the American people and their will is law." [...] By the end of 1896, Bryan had published {{his account of the}} campaign, The First Battle. [...] In the book, Bryan {{made it clear that the}} first battle would not be the last, [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>right,</b> we shall yet triumph." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ali Farka Touré {{inverted}} the stereotype: [...] "For some people, {{when you}} say 'Timbuktu' {{it is like the}} end of the world, but that is not true. I am from Timbuktu, and I can tell you that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>right</b> {{at the heart of the}} world." ...|$|E

2500|$|Soon afterward, Terry Glenn was {{released}} to waivers. Owner Jerry Jones explained that, [...] "I {{think at the}} end of the day, it had more to do with where <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>right</b> now, the managing of how he got to the field, the aspect of concentrating on the what ifs and how it might've impacted how we give our young players a chance, and how we evaluate that position." [...] The main story lines in camp have revolved around the new addition of Adam [...] "Pacman" [...] Jones, and the injury to Terence Newman. Jones was proving daily in camp that he is still worthy of being named one of the top cornerbacks in the league, but was not fully reinstated to the NFL until August 28. Newman injured his groin on July 28, and is expected to be out for three weeks.|$|E
2500|$|Leader of the Opposition and NDP leader Thomas Mulcair said [...] that [...] "Chris Alexander {{has a lot}} {{to answer}} for, but that’s not where <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>right</b> now. We’re worried about how we got here, how the {{collective}} international response has been so defective, how Canada has failed so completely." [...] NDP MP Fin Donnelly was accused of using the tragic event as a means to garner votes, because he initially told reporters that he had personally handed a letter to Immigration Minister Chris Alexander urging the minister to look at the refugee application of Alan Kurdi's family, but that Canadian immigration authorities denied the family's application. However, later the aunt of Alan Kurdi revealed that the application was made only for Kurdi's uncle and was rejected because it was not complete. Meanwhile, the Citizenship and Immigration Canada office clarified that they had not received the proper documentation to certify refugee status for the uncle's family. Mulcair later defended Donnelly, saying that no apology was warranted because the letter had mentioned both families, and stated that he [...] "couldn’t be prouder to have someone of the strength, integrity and hard work as Fin Donnelly" [...] in caucus.|$|E
2500|$|The Shakespearean critic A.C. Bradley {{was more}} ambivalent. Though agreeing that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>right</b> to [...] "turn with disgust from Tate's sentimental adaptations, from his {{marriage}} of Edgar and Cordelia, {{and from that}} cheap moral which every one of Shakespeare's tragedies contradicts, 'that Truth and Virtue shall at last succeed'", yet he [...] "venture to doubt" [...] that [...] "Tate and Dr. Johnson [...] altogether in the wrong". Sharing Johnson's view that the tragic ending was too harsh, too shocking, Bradley observed that [...] King Lear, while frequently described as Shakespeare's greatest work, {{the best of his}} plays, was yet less popular than Hamlet, Macbeth, and Othello; that the general reader, though acknowledging its greatness, would also speak of it with a certain distaste; and that it was the least often presented on stage, as well as being the least successful there. Bradley suggested that the feeling which prompted Tate's alteration and which allowed it to replace Shakespeare on stage for over a century was a general wish that Lear and Cordelia might escape their doom. Distinguishing between the philanthropic sense, which also wishes other tragic figures to be saved, and the dramatic sense, which does not, but which still wishes to spare Lear and Cordelia, he suggested that the emotions have already been sufficiently stirred before their deaths, and he believed that Shakespeare would have given Lear [...] "peace and happiness by Cordelia's fireside", had he taken the subject in hand a few years later, {{at the time that he}} was writing Cymbeline and The Winter's Tale. Agreeing with Lamb that the agony that Lear has undergone makes [...] "a fair dismissal from the stage of life the only decorous thing for him", Bradley argues that [...] "it is precisely this fair dismissal which we desire for him", not the renewed anguish which Shakespeare inflicts on him with the death of Cordelia.|$|E
