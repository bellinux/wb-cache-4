5|$|After his divorce, Vainio's life slowly {{began to}} change. Creatively he <b>was</b> <b>more</b> {{prolific}} than ever in the late 1970s and 1980s. He began composing in addition to writing lyrics. He worked a lot with Veikko Samuli and Jaakko Salo, and Salo started arranging songs Vainio had written.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Harlan {{claimed that}} his script was less antisemitic than the Metzger/Möller script. He even {{claimed that the}} Mendes' script <b>was</b> <b>more</b> antisemitic than his. However, in rebuttal, Haggith and Newman point out that Harlan added an {{important}} sequence in which Süß {{is responsible for the}} execution of a blacksmith, a sequence which served to increase the audience's hatred for Süß.|$|E
5|$|All eight {{were cleared}} by Phips' proclamations, leading Stoughton to storm from the court. His {{replacement}} {{on the court}} <b>was</b> <b>more</b> inclined to mercy for the accused. Beginning in February 1693, no more of the accused were condemned to die, and almost all had been released from prison by May.|$|E

5|$|Although Kennan had {{not been}} {{considered}} for a job by Kennedy's advisers, the president himself offered Kennan the choice of ambassadorship in either Poland or Yugoslavia. Kennan <b>was</b> <b>more</b> interested in Yugoslavia, so he accepted Kennedy's offer and began his job in Yugoslavia during May 1961.|$|E
5|$|Although the Nanbu clan by {{the time}} of the 24th {{hereditary}} chieftain Nanbu Harumasa controlled seven districts of northern Mutsu province (Nukanobu, Hei, Kazuno, Kuji, Iwate, Shiwa and Tōno), the clan <b>was</b> <b>more</b> of a loose collection of competing branches without strong central authority.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the arena}} opened in 1994 (and the {{original}} arena was demolished in 1999), renovations on {{the opera house}} did not begin until 2007. This <b>was</b> <b>more</b> than 15 years after the initial development plan. The Peabody Opera House (named for corporate contributor Peabody Energy) reopened on October 1, 2011, with performances by Jay Leno and Aretha Franklin.|$|E
5000|$|Cabinet faces. Solid wood {{remains a}} popular choice for cabinet parts, {{including}} bases, frames, doors, and sides. However, traditional-style solid-wood cabinetry <b>is</b> <b>more</b> expensive and many consumers opt for cabinets that incorporate particle board or plywood to reduce costs. Pricing for solid wood cabinet doors {{depends on the}} wood species used. For example, teak <b>is</b> <b>more</b> expensive than cherry, which <b>is</b> <b>more</b> expensive than maple, which <b>is</b> <b>more</b> expensive than oak. Similarly, solid wood <b>is</b> <b>more</b> expensive than plywood which, in turn, <b>is</b> <b>more</b> expensive than particle board or similar sheet goods.|$|R
50|$|With the new perfected Spell of Life, the Amenti {{are truly}} alive. Upon {{returning}} to life, the Amenti <b>is</b> <b>more</b> alive than ever before. His senses <b>are</b> <b>more</b> refined, and sensation <b>is</b> <b>more</b> intense. Lights <b>are</b> <b>more</b> colorful and brighter. Sex <b>is</b> <b>more</b> fulfilling. Food <b>is</b> <b>more</b> flavorful. Life becomes indescribably more sensuous. They eat, sleep and breathe. Their life force is extremely strong. In the novel Lay Down With Lions, the zombie Carpenter compared the life force of humans as candles, the Imbued as halogen {{lights and the}} Amenti as a light house.|$|R

5|$|Anthony LaPaglia {{was cast}} as Al Capone and filmed a single scene, which was {{omitted from the}} final cut, {{and can be found}} in the DVD's deleted scenes. Mendes {{believed}} that Capone <b>was</b> <b>more</b> menacing as an unseen presence. Actor Alfred Molina was approached to portray Capone, but Molina was forced to turn the role down due to scheduling conflicts with Frida (2002).|$|E
5|$|Art Salsberg {{became the}} editor of Popular Electronics in 1974 with a goal of {{reclaiming}} the lead in projects. He wanted to publish a computer project that <b>was</b> <b>more</b> functional and elegant than the Mark-8. Les Solomon knew MITS was working on an Intel 8080 based computer project and thought Roberts could provide the project for the always popular January issue.|$|E
5|$|As the Confederation, {{from its}} {{foundation}} in 1291, was almost exclusively composed of German-speaking regions, the earliest forms of literature are in German. In the 18th century, French became the fashionable language in Bern and elsewhere, while {{the influence of}} the French-speaking allies and subject lands <b>was</b> <b>more</b> marked than before.|$|E
50|$|Notwithstanding {{the above}} objections, some authors enumerate {{positive}} externalities for the automobile like accessibility and land value. Where land is expensive, it <b>is</b> developed <b>more</b> intensively. Where it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> intensively developed, there <b>are</b> <b>more</b> activities and destinations {{that can be}} reached in a given time. Where there <b>are</b> <b>more</b> activities, accessibility <b>is</b> higher and where accessibility is higher, land <b>is</b> <b>more</b> expensive.|$|R
5000|$|In the Caribbean, the {{geographic}} {{distribution of the}} virus <b>is</b> <b>more</b> uniform, and it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> common among those with many sexual partners, indicating that sexual transmission <b>is</b> <b>more</b> common.|$|R
50|$|While there {{tended to}} <b>be</b> <b>more</b> singlewomen in {{northern}} Europe than in southern Europe, there <b>were</b> also <b>more</b> singlewomen in {{towns and cities}} than in the countryside. This phenomenon is likely {{due to the fact}} that there <b>were</b> <b>more</b> opportunities for female employment in urban areas. Singlewomen may have <b>been</b> much <b>more</b> prevalent in cities because sex ratios <b>were</b> <b>more</b> equal in rural areas. As there tended to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> women than men in urban areas, lifelong singlewomen <b>were</b> often <b>more</b> abundant in urban areas.|$|R
5|$|At its peak, Duncan & Miller's {{glass was}} one of Washington's most {{successful}} manufacturing concerns, and <b>was</b> <b>more</b> widely known throughout the county than any other line of goods made in Washington.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} in Hawaii, gold coins brought a premium over their face value if {{purchased}} with silver; only gold {{could be used for}} certain transactions, such as paying customs duties. Silver had been heavily imported into the kingdom in the 1870s despite government efforts to slow the flow with taxes, and thus gold <b>was</b> <b>more</b> expensive there in terms of silver than in the United States, which <b>was</b> <b>more</b> stable monetarily. Any large influx of silver into circulation, such as by the Kalākaua coins, meant that silver {{in the hands of the}} public might become worth less in terms of gold. In 1883, Hawaii was in a recession, due in part to a fall in sugar prices because of overproduction.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the {{publication}} of the journal, Covent Garden, although formally associated with the theatre industry, <b>was</b> <b>more</b> widely known as London's red light district. Fielding had earlier written The Covent Garden Tragedy, a mock-tragic play concerning the tale of two prostitutes.|$|E
50|$|Mules are {{preferred}} {{because they}} <b>are</b> <b>more</b> tolerant to heat than horses. Horses <b>are</b> <b>more</b> efficient {{in cold weather}} and mules <b>are</b> <b>more</b> effective in deserts. Horses <b>are</b> <b>more</b> {{likely to suffer from}} exhaustion when compared to mules. Since mules are relatively slower than horses they are much safer to ride than horses. It is cheaper to rear a mule than a horse because they consume less. Lastly, mules <b>are</b> <b>more</b> enduring than a horse and can live longer.|$|R

50|$|Children who <b>are</b> <b>more</b> {{likely to}} <b>be</b> abused often display {{characteristics}} of being difficult for workers {{to deal with}} and needing more one-on-one supervision, isolation from their family, and previous victims of abuse. Male children <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to <b>be</b> abused, and <b>are</b> <b>more</b> often abused physically and neglectfully, while females <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to <b>be</b> sexually abused.|$|R
5|$|Authentic {{gardens of}} the yeoman cottager would have {{included}} a beehive and livestock, and frequently a pig and sty, {{along with a}} well. The peasant cottager of medieval times <b>was</b> <b>more</b> interested in meat than flowers, with herbs grown for medicinal use and cooking, rather than for their beauty. By Elizabethan times there <b>was</b> <b>more</b> prosperity, and thus more room to grow flowers. Even the early cottage garden flowers typically had their practical use—violets were spread on the floor (for their pleasant scent and keeping out vermin); calendulas and primroses were both attractive and used in cooking. Others, such as sweet william and hollyhocks were grown entirely for their beauty.|$|E
5|$|Bush portrayed {{himself as}} a {{compassionate}} conservative, implying he <b>was</b> <b>more</b> centrist than other Republicans. He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House, increasing {{the size of the}} United States Armed Forces, cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities. By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and McCain.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s {{the term}} {{crinoline}} <b>was</b> <b>more</b> usually {{applied to the}} fashionable silhouette provided by horsehair petticoats, and to the hoop skirts that replaced them in the mid-1850s. In form and function these hoop skirts were similar to the 16th- and 17th-century farthingale and to 18th-century panniers, in that they too enabled skirts to spread even wider and more fully.|$|E

5|$|By the 1930s, {{accommodation}} on Park Lane and Piccadilly <b>was</b> <b>more</b> popular, {{leading to}} closures on Northumberland Avenue.

5|$|Despite its popularization {{in later}} times, the phrase is not {{recorded}} elsewhere in Roman history. Historians question {{whether it was}} ever used as a customary salute. It <b>was</b> <b>more</b> likely an isolated appeal by desperate captives and criminals condemned to die, and noted by Roman historians in part for the unusual mass reprieve granted by Claudius to the survivors.|$|E
