50|$|The two-door model {{differed}} {{very little}} {{from the more}} popular four-door model in overall appearance, the two-door featured non-wraparound front and rear bumpers (although this would change in 1973 to full <b>wraparound</b> <b>bumpers),</b> whilst the four-door featured <b>wraparound</b> <b>bumpers</b> from the start. Two front bumper under-riders were fitted to the two-door model; however these were deleted on later cars from around late 1972 / early 1973.|$|R
5000|$|In 1971, the 02 Series {{received}} a facelift. The 3-door hatchback [...] "Touring" [...] body {{style and the}} 1802 model were introduced {{as part of the}} facelift, and the 2002ti was replaced by the 2002tii. Other changes included <b>wraparound</b> <b>bumpers</b> for all models, a 2-piece instrument cluster and new seats.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1987-89 a {{facelift}} was phased in, {{which helped}} {{to soften the}} sharp bodylines. The redesign included a taller and more rounded grille with mesh grille and bonnet, aerodynamic wing mirrors and 15" [...] disc-shaped alloy wheels, now mounted on 5-lug hubs. Some models received the <b>wraparound</b> <b>bumpers</b> with integral foglights and the deep sills introduced with the 2.24v.|$|R
50|$|In early 1980 {{an updated}} variant was introduced. The De Luxe was dropped. The 1980 {{model can be}} {{recognized}} by a new grille with somewhat larger openings, new wheels, and new <b>wraparound</b> <b>bumpers</b> in black plastic. Chevrolet badges {{were removed from the}} car, as GM South Africa were phasing out the Chevrolet name in the country. The Chevair was replaced by the front-wheel drive Opel Ascona in South Africa in 1983.|$|R
5000|$|Pat Harrington, Jr. {{provided}} voices {{for both}} the Inspector {{as well as his}} assistant, the Barcelona-born Spanish gendarme Deux-Deux (pronounced [...] "Du-Du"), a common French nickname for Eduard/Eduardo. The frustrated Commissioner was voiced primarily by Paul Frees. Larry Storch, Marvin Miller and Mark Skor also alternated providing the Commissioner's voice. Miller also assumed the role of both the Inspector and Sgt. Deux-Deux in the <b>wraparound</b> <b>bumpers</b> produced for the inaugural season of The Pink Panther Show.|$|R
5000|$|The Buick Y-Job was {{the auto}} industry's first concept car, {{produced}} by Buick in 1938. [...] Designed by Harley J. Earl, {{the car had}} power-operated hidden headlamps, a [...] "gunsight" [...] hood ornament, electric windows, <b>wraparound</b> <b>bumpers,</b> flush door handles, and prefigured styling cues used by Buick until the 1950s and the vertical waterfall grille design still used by Buick today. It used a Buick Super chassis, indicated by the word [...] "Super" [...] located above the rear license plate.|$|R
50|$|While Davis {{himself was}} {{ultimately}} convicted of fraud, he maintained his innocence throughout his life. He dabbled with numerous other projects and ventures, {{perhaps the most}} notable of which was creating Dodge 'Em bumper cars, which ultimately became popular amusement park attractions. He later tried to adopt the Dodge 'Em's <b>wraparound</b> <b>bumpers</b> into a design for a safer three-wheeled road car before he retired to Palm Springs and ultimately died from emphysema in 1973. His vehicles would occasionally make appearances in popular media, including in the Zippy the Pinhead comic strip and the Discovery Channel television program Chasing Classic Cars.|$|R
2500|$|Again in 1946 the Custom Cruiser 98 {{was the top}} of the Oldsmobile line. Three {{body styles}} were offered (a 4-door sedan, a 2-door Club coupe and a 2-door convertible) and all were eight {{cylinder}} powered. Technical features included electro hardened pistons, full pressure lubrication and automatic choke with fast idle mode. Standard equipment included front and rear bumper guards, vacuum booster pump, dual sun visors, cigarette lighter and plastic radiator ornament, <b>wraparound</b> <b>bumpers,</b> Deluxe instrument cluster clock, rear armrest, and foam rubber sheet cushions. Tire size was [...] by [...] Available upholstery was either leather, broadcloth, or Bedford cord. 14,364 98s were sold in its first postwar year of production.|$|R
50|$|Records {{show that}} {{approximately}} {{one hundred and}} sixty-seven Streco Turnpike Cruisers were built, and fourteen amusement parks {{are known to have}} ordered the cars, which were powered by single-cylinder Kohler Company K-Series engines through matched centrifugal clutches at governed speeds of approximately six to eight miles per hour in single file along pre-fixed guideways and/or on winding pathways and, in some parks, with a fixed center guiderail to limit lateral motion. Streco Turnpike Cruiser bodies were constructed of solid fiberglass, and featured prominent tailfins (in conjunction with the fashion of the period), and also full <b>wraparound</b> <b>bumpers</b> for driver/passenger protection. The first series Streco cars were distinguished by standard twin-headlamp configurations, with the more rugged second series cars distinguishable by their quad headlamps.|$|R
5000|$|The DB2/4 {{was based}} on the DB2, which it replaced. Changes {{included}} a <b>wraparound</b> windscreen, larger <b>bumpers,</b> and repositioned headlights.|$|R
50|$|For 1957, Chrysler cars, {{including}} the Windsor, were restyled again. This time with taller tailfins with vertical taillights, thinner C-pillars, and a <b>wraparound</b> front <b>bumper.</b> Mid-year, dual headlights became standard. Front head room grew to 35.7 inches. Safety equipment was optional on the Windsor. Unfortunately for Chrysler, 1957 cars were plagued with quality problems, such as breaking torsion bar suspensions and rust.|$|R
50|$|For 1974, in a {{move that}} would begin to break away from the styling of the 1960s slab-sided Continentals, both front and rear bumpers were {{replaced}} by <b>wraparound</b> 5-mph <b>bumpers.</b> The vertical waterfall grille and blank headlight doors were styling themes carried over from the Continental Mark IV; in the rear, the wraparound taillight design of the Mark IV would influence the Continental.|$|R
2500|$|The first postwar Pontiac {{available}} (September 13, 1945) was the Streamliner coupe, which {{remained the}} sole product for a time. The Chieftain trim level of 1942 was renamed the Deluxe trim level in 1946. Styling highlights of Pontiacs were <b>wraparound</b> <b>bumpers,</b> a massive 14 blade grille, new nameplates and concealed safe-light parking lamps. Streamliners {{could be identified}} by straight back Indian moldings on the rear hood ornament chrome beltline moldings and bright moldings on the [...] "speedline" [...] fender ribs. They also had longer front fender crown moldings and were generally larger in size. Lettering on hood emblems and badges placed forward of the [...] "speedlines" [...] identified Eights. Interior trim on passenger cars were in gray striped cloth. Station wagons had three seats in standard trim, two seats in Deluxe trim and used imitation leather upholstery and passenger car style interior hardware. Ranging in price from $1942 for a standard Six to $2047 for a Deluxe Eight, Streamliner station wagons continued {{to be the most}} expensive Pontiac model. A total of 92,731 Streamliners were sold in 1946, accounting for over two thirds of all Pontiacs.|$|R
5000|$|The S-10 Cameo, and Cameo EL, {{appearance}} {{package for}} the S-10 pickup 2WD, from 1989-1991, In 1989 these trucks came in 3 color choices Apple Red, Frost White or Midnight black solid exterior colors, In 1991 other Tone-on-Tone paint schemes were available, and has the additional exterior features: a <b>wraparound</b> front <b>bumper</b> fascia with fog lamps. lower body ground-effects moldings and wheel flares, a flush-fitting tailgate valance, rear roll pan (If state laws allowed), and [...] "Cameo" [...] lettering on the doors and tailgate.|$|R
2500|$|The Charger {{was changed}} {{slightly}} for the 1970 model year. This {{would be the}} last year of the 2nd generation Charger and featured a large <b>wraparound</b> chrome <b>bumper</b> and the grille was no longer divided in the middle. New electric headlight doors replaced the old vacuum style. [...] The taillights were similar to those used in 69, but 500 and R/T models came with a new more attractive taillight panel. On the R/T, new rear-facing scoops with the R/T logo were mounted on the front doors, over the door scallops. A new 440 or HEMI hood cutout made the option list for this year only.|$|R
5000|$|In 1984, the York {{diesel engine}} was {{redesigned}} into the 2.5 L [...] "DI" [...] (direct injection) unit. At this time this generation received a minor facelift including a grey plastic front grille with integrated headlamp surrounds, <b>wraparound</b> indicators, longer <b>bumper</b> end caps and multifunction rear lights incorporating fog, indicator, reversing and side lights {{for the panel}} van. This facelift did not commonly result in a new [...] "Mark" [...] number.|$|R
5000|$|Rover made {{an attempt}} {{to break into the}} North American market with the P6, {{beginning}} with the Rover 2000 TC. One version of the P6 that was exported was the NADA (North American Dollar Area) model, equipped to a higher standard than UK cars. These are also often referred to today as being [...] "Federal Specification". Notable differences outside the car were <b>wraparound</b> <b>bumpers,</b> three air scoops {{on the top of the}} bonnet, front and rear wing reflectors and the [...] "Icelert" [...] on the front grill. The [...] "Icelert" [...] was a sensor which warned the driver of falling outside temperatures and the possibility of ice forming on the road. Inside, depending on the location, the US 3500S was also equipped with electric windows, power steering and air conditioning, all of which are extremely unusual in UK market P6 cars. The NADA P6 introduced features which would later appear on the UK Mark II car including a new instrument cluster and seat piping. Despite being badged as [...] "3500S" [...] cars, the export models were all fitted with the Borg Warner 35 automatic transmission. The cars were not popular with American buyers, but were sold in Europe instead as they were already converted to left-hand drive. In true British Leyland fashion, several UK cars also ended up with single scoops on their bonnets in {{an attempt to}} use up the surplus parts from the now defunct export models. Rover discontinued selling the P6 in North America in 1971: in that year the US had taken fewer than 1,500 Rovers. The company told their US dealers that modifying their cars to meet new US federal safety and pollution requirements would be prohibitively expensive, while experience elsewhere suggests that the Rover four-cylinder engine was particularly hard to adapt for reduced octane lead-free fuels without an unacceptable reduction in the car's performance.|$|R
50|$|Even more {{important}} to the company's fortunes was 1968's Saab 99. The 99 was the first all-new Saab in 19 years, and unlike its predecessors, severed all ties with the 92. The 99 had many innovations and features that would come to define Saabs for decades: <b>wraparound</b> windscreen, self-repairing <b>bumpers,</b> headlamp washers and side-impact door beams. The design by Sixten Sason was no less revolutionary than the underlying technology, and elements like the Saab hockey stick profile graphic continue to influence Saab design.|$|R
5000|$|The network {{also carries}} some {{traditional}} full-length films and documentaries - which air {{as part of}} the [...] "TBD Movie of the Day," [...] airing seven days a week at midday and on Thursday evenings - that were acquired through an agreement with independent film distributor Gravitas Ventures. The network also carries educational programs distributed by Telco Productions on Saturday and Sunday mornings to fulfill Children's Television Act requirements outlined by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). <b>Wraparounds</b> and other <b>bumper</b> segments may be employed at some point (to serve as a transition between shows or videos), as well the possible utilization of direct contributions from viewers.|$|R
50|$|Lead sleds {{were and}} are {{designed}} for artistic style and expression and not for speed. Among the first customized cars referred to as Lead Sleds were built by Harry Westergard in Sacramento, California. Westergard modified over a dozen cars ranging from a 1931 Model A Ford roadster to two 1947 Chevrolets. He used lead extensively to fill openings in doors, hoods and trunk lids and adapt front ends to accommodate grills from more expensive cars such as Buicks, LaSalles and Packards and in the extension of front fenders. Upgraded <b>bumpers</b> and <b>bumper</b> <b>wraparounds</b> were also common with the ribbed DeSoto bumper and '49 Chevy license guard favored on Westergard Lead Sleds from the 1930s or 1940s.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{his ties}} to the {{blackcurrant}} flavour, Gardner himself later appeared in two advertisements for the orange flavour. The first of these advertisements, Clowns, aired between late 1997 and early 1998 and showed him encouraging a colleague at an event where clowns were being run over by giant trucks. The advertisement was released to promote the send-away Tango Horn toy, but Tango themselves appeared to deem the advert a failure when a further advertisement in early 1998 humorously dismissed the advert as such. Gardner's second Tango Orange advertisement aired in mid-1998 during the 1998 FIFA World Cup and showed Gardner advertising a competition to win television sets {{as part of the}} brand's World Cup promotions. He sported the same uniform as in the start of St George. Additionally, Gardner appeared in several <b>wraparound</b> stings (break <b>bumpers)</b> during ITV's coverage of the World Cup where he is shown exploring Paris between games, although these stings do not feature Tango branding.|$|R
5000|$|From 1970 to 1978, the Capri {{was sold}} in North America through Ford's Lincoln-Mercury Division. All were German-produced. Headlamps were four round sealed-beams (shared with the Capri RS3000), and turn signal lamps were grille-mounted on all US-spec 1971-74 Capris and 1976-78 Capri IIs. Full {{instrumentation}} wasn't available on 1971-72 four-cylinder models but was made standard equipment from 1973 on. An optional interior decor package, changed by name to the [...] "Ghia" [...] package for the Capri II, featured deluxe interior trim and features. 1973 Ford Capris were the Mk I face-lift models featuring the new grille, larger taillights and new interior and dash. The 1973 model had the federally mandated 2.5 mph front bumper for '73. The bumper was extended, the gap closed with a silver filler panel. 1974 models had larger bumpers front and rear with <b>wraparound</b> urethane, body-color <b>bumper</b> covers to meet the revised Federal front and rear 5 mph standard. 1976-78 models were the re-designed hatchback models offered worldwide since 1974, fitted with the grille-mounted turn signal lamps and the required round sealed-beam headlamps, 5 mph body-color bumpers and catalytic converter, requiring no-lead fuel. In 1976, an 'S' (JPS) special edition featured black or white paint with gold-coloured wheels, gold pin-striping, and upgraded two-tone interior in beige and black. Due to late production of Capri IIs, there were no 1975 models sold in the USA.|$|R
