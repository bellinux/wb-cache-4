5|$|Upon {{arrival at}} Los Angeles Airport, Cobb passes the U.S. {{immigration}} checkpoint and Professor Miles accompanies {{him to his}} home. Using his totem—a spinning top that spins indefinitely in a dream <b>world</b> <b>but</b> falls over in reality—Cobb conducts a test {{to prove that he}} is indeed in the real <b>world,</b> <b>but</b> he ignores its result and instead joins his children in the garden.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is a {{relatively}} rare neoplasm that is classified as an adenocarcinoma (a cancer that forms glands or secretes significant amounts of mucins). It has an annual incidence rate of 1–2 cases per 100,000 in the Western <b>world,</b> <b>but</b> rates of cholangiocarcinoma have been rising worldwide {{over the past few}} decades.|$|E
5|$|Duke Slater (played by Ronnie Schell) is Gomer's {{friend and}} platoon-mate. Schell left {{the show in}} the fourth season to star in the {{short-lived}} show Good Morning, <b>World</b> <b>but</b> returned in the final season as the corporal of Gomer's platoon.|$|E

5|$|I do {{not know}} what I may appear to the <b>world,</b> <b>but</b> to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and {{diverting}} myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.|$|E
5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, Germany was the toy making capitol of the <b>world,</b> <b>but</b> high {{importation}} costs made German toys relatively expensive in America. Toy costs were lowered when German toymakers began mass-producing toys {{under the direction}} of Frank Woolworth and shipping their products to Woolworth's warehouses for packaging and distribution.|$|E
5|$|Libby's {{original}} exchange reservoir hypothesis {{assumed that}} the / ratio in the exchange reservoir is constant all over the <b>world,</b> <b>but</b> it has since been discovered that there are several causes of variation in the ratio across the reservoir.|$|E
50|$|Yet {{another example}} of the use of the 'accessibility relation' is in deontic logic. If we think of obligatoriness as truth in all morally perfect worlds, and {{permissibility}} as truth in some morally perfect world, then we will have to restrict out universe to include only morally perfect <b>worlds.</b> <b>But,</b> in that case, we will have left out the actual world. A better alternative would be to include all the metaphysically possible <b>worlds</b> <b>but</b> restrict the 'accessibility relation' to morally perfect worlds. Transitivity and the euclidean property will hold, but reflexivity and symmetry will not.|$|R

5|$|On November 22, 2013, Nintendo {{released}} The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, {{which takes}} place in the same <b>world,</b> <b>but</b> features a new storyline, new puzzles and original dungeons. Height and depth play a large role in the game by taking advantage of the 3DS’ 3D feature, while maintaining the traditional top-down perspective.|$|E
5|$|Quantum {{mechanics}} introduces {{an important}} {{change in the}} way probabilities are computed. Probabilities are still represented by the usual real numbers we use for probabilities in our everyday <b>world,</b> <b>but</b> probabilities are computed as the square of probability amplitudes. Probability amplitudes are complex numbers.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{protozoa}} can cause gastroenteritis – most commonly Giardia lamblia – but Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium spp., {{and other species}} have also been implicated. As a group, these agents comprise about 10% of cases in children. Giardia occurs more commonly in the developing <b>world,</b> <b>but</b> this etiologic agent causes this type of illness to some degree nearly everywhere. It occurs more commonly in persons who have traveled to areas with high prevalence, children who attend day care, {{men who have sex}} with men, and following disasters.|$|E
5|$|Ambulance Care Assistant – Have {{varying levels}} of {{training}} across the <b>world,</b> <b>but</b> these staff are usually only required to perform patient transport duties (which can include stretcher or wheelchair cases), rather than acute care. Dependent on provider, they may be trained in first aid or extended skills such as use of an AED, oxygen therapy and other lifesaving or palliative skills. They may provide emergency cover when other units are not available, or when accompanied by a fully qualified technician or paramedic.|$|E
40|$|In logic, the spatio-temporal {{location}} of a proposition is characterized precisely within a Cartesian system {{of space and time}} coordinates. This is suitable for characterizing the truth value of propositions relative to possible <b>worlds,</b> <b>but</b> not for modeling the spatio-temporal orientation of natural cognitive agents...|$|R

5|$|American {{football}} leagues exist {{throughout the}} <b>world,</b> <b>but</b> {{the game has}} yet to achieve the international success and popularity of baseball and basketball.

5|$|Bumblebee {{conservation}} {{is in its}} infancy {{in many parts of}} the <b>world,</b> <b>but</b> with the realization of the important part they play in pollination of crops, efforts are being made to manage farmland better. Enhancing the wild bee population can be done by the planting of wildflower strips, and in New Zealand, bee nesting boxes have achieved some success, perhaps because there are few burrowing mammals to provide potential nesting sites in that country.|$|E
5|$|Daenerys Targaryen {{arrives with}} Khal Moro's khalasar at Vaes Dothrak, and is escorted {{to meet with}} the Dosh Khaleen by Moro's bloodriders. The elder of the Dosh Khaleen tries to sympathize with Daenerys, saying she was once married to a great khal with whom she thought she would rule the <b>world</b> <b>but</b> met the same fate. After giving Daenerys a change of clothes, she {{explains}} that the various khalasar have gathered at Vaes Dothrak to discuss which cities and towns to conquer. They have also met to discuss what to do with Daenerys, noting that she hopes for her safety should they decide to let her remain with the Dosh Khaleen.|$|E
