40|$|The General AI Challenge is an {{initiative}} {{to encourage the}} wider artificial intelligence community to focus on important problems in building intelligent machines <b>with</b> <b>more</b> <b>general</b> <b>scope</b> than is currently possible. The challenge comprises of multiple rounds, with the first round focusing on gradual learning, i. e. the ability to re-use already learned knowledge for efficiently learning to solve subsequent problems. In this article, we will present details {{of the first round}} of the challenge, its inspiration and aims. We also outline a more formal description of the challenge and present a preliminary analysis of its curriculum, based on ideas from computational mechanics. We believe, that such formalism will allow for a more principled approach towards investigating tasks in the challenge, building new curricula and for potentially improving consequent challenge rounds.

40|$|Abstract: The {{technique}} of polyphase filterbanks {{is commonly used}} for signal processing in radio astronomy. The rapid and ongoing evolution of parallel hardware architectures requires optimised imple-mentations of such techniques to be redeveloped. However, much of the published research regarding polyphase filterbanks refers the reader to signal processing books <b>with</b> a <b>more</b> <b>general</b> <b>scope.</b> Furthermore, these references {{tend to focus on}} the design of filters, rather than their implementation. For this reason, this work presents a mathematical background for the implementation of a polyphase filterbank specific to radio astronomy. It also addresses {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} polyphase filterbanks in comparison <b>with</b> <b>more</b> commonly used techniques...|$|R
40|$|Background: Removal {{of wisdom}} teeth {{is one of}} the most common {{surgical}} procedures performed in the UK. Little controversy surrounds the removal of impacted third molars when they are associated with pathological changes such as infection, non-restorable carious lesions, cysts, tumours, and destruction of adjacent teeth and bone. However, the justification for prophylactic removal of impacted third molars is less certain and has been debated for many years. Objectives: To provide a summary of existing evidence on prophylactic removal of impacted wisdom teeth, in terms of the incidence of surgical complications associated with prophylactic removal, and the morbidity associated with retention. Methods: A systematic review of the research literature was undertaken. METHODS - DATA SOURCES: An existing review formed the basis of this report, and additional literature searches were undertaken, including searches of electronic databases (MEDLINE, 1984 - 99; EMBASE, 1984 - 99; Science Citation Index, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, National Research Register; Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness), paper sources (including Clinical Evidence), and web-based resources. Relevant organisations and professional bodies were contacted for further information. Methods - study selection: Studies were selected for inclusion if they met the following criteria: (1) design - randomised controlled trials (RCTs), literature reviews, or decision analyses; (2) participants - people with unerupted or impacted third molars, or those undergoing surgical removal of third molars either as prophylaxis or due to associated pathological changes; (3) reported outcomes - either the pathological changes associated with retention of third molars, or post-operative complications following extraction. There were no language restrictions on study selection. METHODS - DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data from included studies were extracted into structured tables and individual study validity was assessed against methodological checklists. Data were summarised descriptively. Decisions relating to study selection, data extraction and validity assessment were made by two independent reviewers, and disagreements were resolved by discussion. For non-English papers, translators were recruited to assist with study selection and data extraction. Results: Forty studies were included in the review: two RCTs, 34 literature reviews, and four decision analysis studies. One RCT in the UK focused on the effects of retained third molars on incisor crowding (predominantly a cosmetic problem) in patients who had previously undergone orthodontic treatment. The results of this trial suggested that the removal of third molars to prevent late incisor crowding cannot be justified. Another on-going RCT in Denmark compares the effects and costs of prophylactic removal of third molars with removal according to morbidity. So far, this trial has recruited 200 participants, and preliminary results indicate that watchful waiting may be a promising strategy. However, more data and longer follow-up of patients are needed to conclude which treatment strategy is the most cost-effective. It is also known that a trial is on-going in the USA but no results are available so far. The methodological quality of the literature reviews was generally poor, and none of the reviews was systematic. Conclusions from nine reviews on anterior crowding suggested that there was only a weak association between retention of third molars and crowding. Six out of 21 reviews <b>with</b> a <b>more</b> <b>general</b> <b>scope</b> also concluded that the prophylactic removal of third molars was unjustified. Twelve general reviews did not conclude with a clear message about the management of third molars. Three reviews suggested that prophylactic removal of third molars is appropriate, but these reviews were of poorer methodological quality than the majority of other reviews. Three out of four papers focusing on surgical management expresse...|$|R

We report here the synthesis of all five resveratrol sulfates achieved using a known approach of selective protection via silyl ether and sulfation but new reaction conditions and isolation procedures, which result in simplified protocols and greatly improved yields. A rationale for the problems so far encountered in handling and isolating resveratrol sulfates is provided as well as a solution based on avoidance of low pressure conditions during purification/isolation. These conclusions are probably of <b>more</b> <b>general</b> <b>scope</b> and might be usefully taken into consideration for obtaining other phenolic sulfates in high yield...|$|R

This study is carried out within a <b>more</b> <b>general</b> <b>scope</b> of understanding concrete behaviour under impact. The studied concrete has properties as close as possible to those used in current construction projects. A triaxial press of high capacity is used to characterize the triaxial behaviour of concrete according to various loading paths.

The triaxial and proportional tests show the existence of strain limit states, defining a limit states threshold independent from the loading path...|$|R

40|$|In the European Union, growing {{attention}} to biofuels is {{directly linked to}} the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and lies therefore in the <b>more</b> <b>general</b> <b>scope</b> of actions to combat climate change. More specifically, in order to cut emissions from transport, the EU has chosen to opt decidedly for first generation biofuels, expecting them to make up 10 % of fuels on the market by 2020. Amongst other things, this will add to the tendency of agricultural prices to increase and become more volatile, favouring the already strong financial speculations and weighing heavily on the possibilities of poorer countries to access food. Given these conditions, the choice to privilege first generation biofuels seems much more functional to the interests and profit strategies of a restricted number of big industrial groups, rather than to the so-claimed general environmental objectives.

The objective of the method is to provide realistic tearing simulations, occuring on 2 D deformable objects, and working in real-time. This method can find applications in surgery simulators, where tearing human tissue is an important feature to provide.

The central idea in this scheme is to "separate" the physical simulation elements, instead of destroying or dividing them.

We assume the worst possible scenario from the photobiological point of view: an already clear atmosphere with no ozone, as the timescale for soot and dust settling (years) is smaller than that of the full ozone regeneration (decades). Even in these conditions we show that most phytoplankton species would have had reasonable potential for photosynthesis in all the three main optical ocean water types. This modelling could help explain why the recovery of phytoplankton was relatively rapid after the huge environmental stress of that asteroid impact.
