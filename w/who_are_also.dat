5|$|Azelaic acid {{has been}} shown to be {{effective}} for mild to moderate acne when applied topically at a 20% concentration. Treatment twice daily for six months is necessary, and is as effective as topical benzoyl peroxide5%, isotretinoin0.05%, and erythromycin2%. Azelaic acid is thought to be an effective acne treatment due to its ability to reduce skin cell accumulation in the follicle, and its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. It has a slight skin-lightening effect due to its ability to inhibit melanin synthesis, and is therefore useful in treating of individuals with acne <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>also</b> affected by postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Azelaic acid may cause skin irritation but is otherwise very safe. It is less effective and more expensive than retinoids.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{complaints}} from bar owners about {{their inability to}} obtain liability insurance, the state passed legislation in 1987 to limit liability to cases where the server could have realistically known that the patron was underage or intoxicated, and to limit lawsuits to types of injuries that are foreseeable. The act also instituted the legal standard of comparative negligence in these cases, wherein the monetary damages against a licensed establishment can be reduced if there are others <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>also</b> negligent (e.g. the patron, other bars). Additional legislation passed in 1987 substantially limited the liability of social hosts for adult guests.|$|E
5|$|Double {{burden is}} a term used to {{describe}} the workload of people who work to earn money, but <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>also</b> responsible for significant amounts of unpaid domestic labor. This phenomenon is also known as The Second Shift as in Arlie Hochschild's book of the same name. In heterosexual couples where both partners have paid jobs, women often spend significantly more time than men on household chores and caring work, such as childrearing or caring for sick family members. This outcome is determined in large part by traditional gender roles that have been accepted by society over time. Labor market constraints also play a role in determining who does the bulk of unpaid work.|$|E

5|$|One form {{of apple}} allergy, {{often found in}} {{northern}} Europe, is called birch-apple syndrome, and is found in people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>also</b> allergic to birch pollen. Allergic reactions are triggered by a protein in apples {{that is similar to}} birch pollen, and people affected by this protein can also develop allergies to other fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Reactions, which entail oral allergy syndrome (OAS), generally involve itching and inflammation of the mouth and throat, but in rare cases can also include life-threatening anaphylaxis. This reaction only occurs when raw fruit is consumed—the allergen is neutralized in the cooking process. The variety of apple, maturity and storage conditions can change the amount of allergen present in individual fruits. Long storage times can increase the amount of proteins that cause birch-apple syndrome.|$|E
