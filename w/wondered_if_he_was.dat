500|$|Richard Eder praised Any Human Heart in the New York Times: [...] "William Boyd, is {{multifaceted}} and inventive, and {{he plays}} a deep game under his agile card tricks." [...] Christopher Tayler, in the London Review of Books, called the characterisation of Mountstuart weak and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> merely a device through which Boyd could write pastiche about 20th-century writers, [...] "Boyd hustles you {{through to the end}} despite all this, but it’s hard not to wonder if it was really worth making the journey." [...] In The Atlantic Monthly, Brooke Allen liked the Mountstuart character: [...] "he is far more generous, forgiving, and free than most of us. He is also more amusing, and more amused by life", thus making an [...] "attractive central character" [...] and Boyd's writing showed [...] "a great natural vitality and an increasingly sophisticated humanism." [...] The Atlantic Monthly selected it as one of the [...] "books of the year".|$|E
500|$|Ash Crimson's {{character}} had a mixed {{reception in}} video-game publications. When he was introduced, GameSpy's Christian Nutt {{called him a}} [...] "clone" [...] of Guile from the Street Fighter series because of their similar movesets but Ash's team was praised as new characters with new elements in the series. Lucas M. Thomas of IGN wrote that a major fan complaint was the character's strength in the games, which {{made him one of}} the strongest opponents despite an apparent lack of effort. According to Thomas, Ash is [...] "nothing if not strange" [...] and the writer lamented his many appearances in the KOF 2003 manhua compared with more-popular characters. When playable characters for the arcade version of The King of Fighters XIII were introduced, Anime News Network's Todd Ciolek speculated about Ash's lack of teammates and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> alone because [...] "no one likes Ash now." [...] Marissa Meli of UGO Networks ranked Ash sixteenth on a list of [...] "The Most Androgynous Video Game Characters", with Meli jokingly attributing his androgynous appearance to a desire by Japanese designers to confuse Western gamers about their sexuality. Although he called Ash's voice one of [...] "Gaming's Top 10 Deepest Voices", Dan Howdle of Now Gamer referred to him as a female character and writers for Game Informer joked about their surprise at the discovery that Ash is a male character. After UTV Ignition Entertainment polled fans to choose an artbox for console versions of The King of Fighters XII, the company announced that Ash's unpopularity reduced the number of potential covers to two (featuring Kyo and Iori). Den of Geek listed Ash as the 23rd best The King of Fighters with the writer comparing him with Loki based on their antagonistic and tricky behaviour as well as how his heroic traits in KOF XIII gave fans different thoughts. Complex listed him as one of gaming's [...] "douchiest" [...] characters androgynous look as well as how he steals the powers of Chizuru Kagura and Iori Yagami.|$|E

60|$|He saw Lizzie occasionally, {{and it was}} patent {{that she}} regretted the greatness {{that had come to}} him. It widened the space between them. Perhaps it was with the hope of {{narrowing}} it that she yielded to his persuasions to go to night school and business college and to have herself gowned by a wonderful dressmaker who charged outrageous prices. She improved visibly from day to day, until Martin <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing right, for he knew that all her compliance and endeavor was for his sake. She was trying to make herself of worth in his eyes--of the sort of worth he seemed to value. Yet he gave her no hope, treating her in brotherly fashion and rarely seeing her.|$|E
60|$|Amused as Lance evidently was at this, his {{absolute}} {{admiration for}} Flip absorbed everything else. With {{his eyes fixed}} upon the girl, he briefly assured the old man that he would pay for everything he wanted. He did this with a manner {{quite different from the}} careless, easy attitude he had assumed toward Flip; at least the quick-witted girl noticed it, and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> angry. It was quite true that ever since his eye had fallen upon another of his own sex, its glance had been less frank and careless. Certain traits of possible impatience, which might develop into man-slaying, were coming to the fore. Yet a word or a gesture of Flip's was sufficient to change that manner, and when, with the fretful assistance of her father, she had prepared a somewhat sketchy and primitive repast, he questioned the old man about diamond-making. The eye of Dad kindled.|$|E
6000|$|He was {{presently}} almost cool, and {{his eyes}} got more used to the rush of air, but he was getting very high, very high. He tilted his head forwards and surveyed the country, blinking. He could see all over Buffalo, a place with three great blackened scars of ruin, and hills and stretches beyond. He <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> half a mile high, or more. There were some people among some houses near a railway station between Niagara and Buffalo, and then more people. They went like ants busily {{in and out of}} the houses. He saw two motor cars gliding along the road towards Niagara city. Then far away in the south he saw a great Asiatic airship going eastward. [...] "Oh, Gord!" [...] he said, and became earnest in his ineffectual attempts to alter his direction. But that airship took no notice of him, and he continued to ascend convulsively. The world got more and more extensive and maplike. Click, clock, clitter-clock. Above him and very near to him now was a hazy stratum of cloud.|$|E

60|$|The {{sensation}} was, however, by {{no means}} new to him. He had felt it now and then before on a long night march when the mind, as it were, released itself from the domination of the worn‐out, but it was plainer now than it had ever been. He had {{during the last few}} days been living under a heavy strain, and now there crowded upon him vague perplexing fancies and elusive memories which he could almost believe had been transmitted him by the soldiers whose blood was in his veins. It was only by an effort that, plodding along with half‐closed eyes, he shook them off and roused himself to attention. Shadowy men moved on into the blackness in front of him, and more were winding out of the gloom behind. Now and then a clump of palms went by, showing a mere patch of obscurity against the clouded sky, and where the road was harder the beat of weary feet rang through the silence hollowly. He did not feel drowsy, but <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> wholly awake when he heard Harper’s voice beside him.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was frightened}} {{to find himself}} out of the house; the door closed between them; no going back without ringing the bell. He couldn't go back. He walked a block, slow, incredulous. He stood {{hesitant}} before the nearest corner drug-store, shivering in the March wind, wondering if he dared go into the store and telephone her. He was willing to concede anything. He planned apt phrases to use. Surely everything would be made right if he could only speak to her. He pictured himself crossing the drug-store floor, entering the telephone-booth, putting five cents in the slot. He stared at the red-and-green globes in the druggist's window; inspected a display of soaps, and recollected the fact that for a week now he had failed to take home any shaving-soap and had had to use ordinary hand-soap. [...] "Golly! I must go in and get a shaving-stick. No, darn it! I haven't got enough money with me. I must try to remember to get some to-morrow." [...] He rebuked himself for thinking of soap when love lay dying. [...] "But I must remember to get that soap, just the same!" [...] So grotesque is man, the slave and angel, for while he was sick with the desire {{to go back to the}} one comrade, he sharply <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not merely acting all this agony. He went into the store. But he did not telephone to Ruth. There was no sufficiently convincing reason for calling her up. He bought a silly ice-cream soda, and talked to the man behind the counter as he drank it. All the while a tragic Ruth stood before him, blaming him for he knew not what.|$|E
60|$|The {{minister}} grew comparatively calm. His eyes, however, {{were soon}} {{greeted by a}} little glimmering light, which, at first {{a long way off}} was approaching up the street. It threw a gleam of recognition, on here a post, and there a garden fence, and here a latticed window-pane, and there a pump, with its full trough of water, and here again an arched door of oak, with an iron knocker, and a rough log for the door-step. The Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale noted all these minute particulars, even while firmly convinced that the doom of his existence was stealing onward, in the footsteps which he now heard; and that the gleam of the lantern would fall upon him in a few moments more, and reveal his long-hidden secret. As the light drew nearer, he beheld, within its illuminated circle, his brother clergyman--or, to speak more accurately, his professional father, as well as highly valued friend--the Reverend Mr. Wilson, who, as Mr. Dimmesdale now conjectured, had been praying at the bedside of some dying man. And so he had. The good old minister came freshly from the death-chamber of Governor Winthrop, who had passed from earth to heaven within that very hour. And now surrounded, like the saint-like personage of olden times, with a radiant halo, that glorified him amid this gloomy night of sin--as if the departed Governor had left him an inheritance of his glory, or as if he had caught upon himself the distant shine of the celestial city, while looking thitherward to see the triumphant pilgrim pass within its gates--now, in short, good Father Wilson was moving homeward, aiding his footsteps with a lighted lantern! The glimmer of this luminary suggested the above conceits to Mr. Dimmesdale, who smiled--nay, almost laughed at them--and then <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going mad.|$|E
6000|$|... "He is deceived, at any rate," [...] thought Hal. [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{waiting for}} somebody, or merely hanging around? I think I will remain {{for a while}} and find out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can't {{get him to}} do anything," [...] Euphrasia replied, with decision; [...] "he'll die {{some day}} {{for want of a}} little common sense. I shouldn't <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> took on soon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is {{certainly}} {{up to something}} out of the ordinary," [...] thought Sam. [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> fishing? <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>is,</b> {{it seems to me it}} is a queer way to go at it." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was much}} warmer {{in the open}} {{than it had been}} in the chapel and thicket, and Cissy, by way of {{relieving}} a certain awkward tension of silence, took off the waterproof cloak and slung it on her arm. This disclosed her five long brown cable-like curls that hung down her shoulders, reaching below her waist in some forgotten fashion of girlhood. They were Cissy's peculiar adornment, remarkable for their length, thickness, and the extraordinary youthfulness imparted to a figure otherwise precociously matured. In some wavering doubt of her actual years and privileges, Brother Seabright offered to carry her cloak for her, but she declined it with a rustic and youthful pertinacity that seemed to settle the question. In fact, Cissy was as much embarrassed as she was flattered by the company of this distinguished stranger. However, it would be known to all West Woodland that he had walked home with her, while nobody but herself would know that they had scarcely exchanged a word. She noticed how he lounged on with a heavy, rolling gait, sometimes a little before or behind her as the path narrowed. At such times when they accidentally came in contact in passing, she felt a half uneasy, physical consciousness of him, which she referred to his size, the scars on his face, or some latent hardness of expression, but was relieved to see that he had not observed it. Yet this was the man that made grown women cry; she thought of old Mrs. Jackson fervently grasping the plodding ankles before her, and a hysteric desire to laugh, with the fear that he might see it on her face, overcame her. Then she <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to walk all the way home without speaking, yet she knew she would be more embarrassed if he began to talk to her.|$|E

Nothing seemed impossible for Edward H. Harriman.|$|E
