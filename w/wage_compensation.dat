A total of 2291 subjects absenting due to back pain during this period were followed for up to 3 yr to identify return to work rates and subsequent absences. Incidence and prevalence rates were 5. 6 and 6. 3 %, respectively. The cost of <b>wages</b> <b>compensation</b> was £ 1. 29 million or 10. 5 % of such benefits paid. Work loss was greater for the second absence. The rate of return to work was broadly in line with that suggested by the Clinical Standards Advisory Group (CSAG), but the number still absent at 1 yr was less, suggest-ing that the CSAG figures for long-term absence may have been overestimated.

40|$|Interregional {{differentials}} in {{nominal wages}} in the Russian Federation are huge {{compared to other}} countries. Using the NOBUS micro-data and a methodology based on the estimation of the wage equation augmented by aggregate regional characteristics, we show that these differentials have a compensative nature. Russian workers receive <b>wage</b> <b>compensations</b> for living in regions with a higher price level and worse non-pecuniary characteristics, such as a relatively low life expectancy, {{a high level of}} air pollution, poor medical services and a colder climate. After adjusting for these regional characteristics, the relative ranking of regions in terms of average wages changes considerably. Moreover, regional nominal wages become positively correlated with interregional migration flows. According to our estimates, half of the interregional wage variation between workers with similar productive characteristics should be considered to be compensative. These results support the view that the best policy reaction to the current high interregional wage differentials should be the removal of migration barriers and a reduction in migration costs. In general, our results show that <b>wage</b> <b>compensations</b> for regional disamenities along with differences in employment composition are able to account for about three fourths of the observed interregional variation in wages. compensating differentials, regional wages, wage equation, interregional migration, transition, Russia...|$|R

A partnership model is suggested for privatization where the Government’s property trust (Treuhandanstait (THA)) is made a silent partner of the private investors.

Furthermore, the paper argues against restructuring policies of the Government’s property trust and proposes to set decreasing limits on the trust’s finances for the years following 1993.

50|$|In {{traditional}} economic theory, {{a worker}} takes his wage as given and decides {{how many hours}} he works. The firm also takes the wage as given and decides how much labor to buy. Then wage is determined in the market to ensure total labor supply equals total labor demand.

Hence, when firms reduce labor demand during a recession, we should {{expect to see a}} fall in wages as well.

Pressure on these cross-border commuters came by means of disadvantages in the allocation of housing, children's training opportunities and the issuance of travel permits. An arbitrary interpretation of the foreign exchange regulations by the SED, up to the imposition of imprisonment, did not lead to the abandonment of their jobs in West Berlin, but instead, in more than 50,000 cases, it lead to these commuters fleeing to the west permanently. Nevertheless, the number of West cross-border commuters did not decrease significantly. fled to the West permanently.

Particularly the firm size effects suggest that collecting more details on social interaction at the workplace should be fruitful for additional research.|$|R
