In 1921 a train ride from Kristiania to Trondheim lasted approximately 15 hours, and the average <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> at each station was between 10 and 15 minutes. On 1 July 1925 dining service was introduced on the Valdres Line, from 1 July 1926 on the Brevik Line, from May 1934 on the Nordland Line and from 15 May 1936 on the Røros Line. In 1948 210,000 meals were served on board, in addition to sandwiches and drinks. The company also offered a light breakfast on night trains on the Kongsvinger, Østfold and Dovre lines. During the Second World War, dining-car service was discontinued.|$|E

Any character can be loaned to three different people, and the loaned character keeps the experience points and gold that they have earned.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Providing {{emergency}} department (ED) <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> {{information to the}} public has been suggested as a mechanism to reduce lengthy ED <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> (by enabling patients to select the ED site with shorter <b>wait</b> <b>time),</b> but the effects of such a program have not been evaluated. We evaluated the effects of such a program in a community with two ED sites. METHODS: Descriptive statistics for <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> of the two sites before and after the publication of <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> information were used to evaluate the effects of the publication of <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> information on <b>wait</b> <b>times.</b> Multivariate logistical regression was used to test whether or not individual patients used published <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> to decide which site to visit. RESULTS: We found that the rates of <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> exceeding 4 h, and the 95 th percentile of <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> in the two sites decreased after the publication of <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> information, even though the average <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> experienced a slight increase. We also found that after controlling for other factors, the site with shorter <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> had a higher likelihood of being selected after the publication of <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> information, but there was no such relationship before the publication. CONCLUSIONS: These findings were consistent with the hypothesis that the publication of <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> information leads to patients selecting the site with shorter <b>wait</b> <b>time.</b> While publishing ED <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> information did not improve average <b>wait</b> <b>time,</b> it reduced the rates of lengthy <b>wait</b> <b>times...</b>|$|R

5|$|Healthcare in Tripura {{features}} a {{universal health care}} system run by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare of the Government of Tripura. The health care infrastructure {{is divided into three}} tiers– the primary health care network, a secondary care system comprising district and sub-divisional hospitals and tertiary hospitals providing speciality and super speciality care. As of 2010–11, there are 17 hospitals, 11 rural hospitals and community health centres, 79 primary health centres, 635 sub-centres/dispensaries, 7 blood banks and 7 blood storage centres in the state. Homeopathic and Ayurvedic styles of medicine are also popular in the state. The National Family Health Survey– 3 conducted in 2005–06 revealed that 20 per cent of the residents of Tripura do not generally use government health facilities, and prefers private medical sector. This is overwhelmingly less compared to the national level, where 65.6 per cent do not rely on government facilities. As in the rest of India, Tripura residents also cite poor quality of care as the most frequent reason for non-reliance over public health sector. Other reasons include distance of the public sector facility, long <b>waiting</b> <b>time,</b> and inconvenient hours of operation. As of 2010, the state's performance in major public health care indices, such as birth rate, infant mortality rate and total fertility rate is better than the national average. The state is vulnerable to epidemics of Malaria, Diarrhea, Japanese Encephalitis and Meningitis. In summer 2014 the state witnessed a major Malaria outbreak.|$|E
5|$|When {{animals are}} faced with a choice to either wait for a reward, or receive a reward right away, the {{discounting}} of the reward is hyperbolic. As the length of time of waiting for a reward increases, the reward is discounted at a gradual rate. Empirical data have suggested that exponential discounting, rewards discounting at a constant rate per unit of <b>waiting</b> <b>time,</b> only occurs when there are random interruptions in foraging. Discounting can also be related to the risk sensitivity of animals. Rather than relating risk to delay, risk sensitivity acts as a function of delay discounting. In a study conducted by Haden and Platt, macaque monkeys were given the choice of a medium reward that they knew they would receive, versus a more risky choice. The riskier choice would reward the monkey with a large reward fifty percent of the time, and a small reward the other fifty percent. The ultimate payoff was the same, but the monkeys preferred the riskier choice. They speculated that the monkeys did not see their action as risky, but rather as a large, delayed reward. They reasoned that the monkeys viewed the large reward as certain: if they did not get the large reward the first time around, they would eventually get it, but at a longer delay.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Prior {{research}} shows that clinical demand and supplier capacity significantly affect the throughput and the <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> within an isolated unit. However, it is doubtful whether characteristics (i. e., demand, capacity, throughput, and <b>wait</b> <b>time)</b> of one unit would affect the <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of subsequent units on the patient flow process. Focusing on cardiac care, this paper aims to {{examine the impact of}} characteristics of the catheterization unit (CU) on the <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of cardiac surgery unit (SU). METHODS: This study integrates published data from several sources on characteristics of the CU and SU units in 11 hospitals in Ontario, Canada between 2005 and 2008. It proposes a two-layer <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> model (with each layer representing one unit) to examine the impact of CU's characteristics on the <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of SU and test the hypotheses using the Partial Least Squares-based Structural Equation Modeling analysis tool. RESULTS: Results show that: (i) <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of CU has a direct positive impact on <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of SU (β = 0. 330, p < 0. 01); (ii) capacity of CU has a direct positive impact on demand of SU (β = 0. 644, p < 0. 01); (iii) within each unit, there exist significant relationships among different characteristics (except for the effect of throughput on <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> in SU). CONCLUSION: Characteristics of CU have direct and indirect impacts on <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of SU. Specifically, demand and <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of preceding unit are good predictors for <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> of subsequent units. This suggests that considering such cross-unit effects is necessary when alleviating <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> in a health care system. Further, different patient risk profiles may affect <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> in different ways (e. g., positive or negative effects) within SU. This implies that the <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> management should carefully consider the relationship between priority triage and risk stratification, especially for cardiac surgery...|$|R

25|$|Nonlinear {{two-dimensional}} {{infrared spectroscopy}} is the infrared version of correlation spectroscopy. Nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy {{is a technique}} that has become available {{with the development of}} femtosecond infrared laser pulses. In this experiment, first a set of pump pulses is applied to the sample. This is followed by a <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> during which the system is allowed to relax. The typical <b>waiting</b> <b>time</b> lasts from zero to several picoseconds, and the duration can be controlled with a resolution of tens of femtoseconds.

The nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectrum is a two-dimensional correlation plot of the frequency ω1 that was excited by the initial pump pulses and the frequency ω3 excited by the probe pulse after the <b>waiting</b> <b>time.</b> This allows the observation of coupling between different vibrational modes; because of its extremely fine time resolution, {{it can be used to}} monitor molecular dynamics on a picosecond timescale.

25|$|As with {{two-dimensional}} nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} (2DNMR) spectroscopy, this technique spreads the spectrum in two dimensions and allows for the observation of cross peaks that contain information on the coupling between different modes.

These excitations result in excited state absorption peaks located below the diagonal and cross peaks. In 2DNMR, two distinct techniques, COSY and NOESY, are frequently used.

The main contribution of this thesis is to design and develop a discrete event simulation tool in JAVA to study the <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> (<b>wait</b> <b>time</b> 1 and <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> 2) for patients in cataract surgical procedure. Two cataract surgical procedures are simulated in the simulation tool Northern Health Cataract Surgical Model (NHCS Model) and Cataract Surgery Generic Model (CSG Model). Two alternative patient referral methods (refer patients to the surgeon with the least number of patients and uniform distribution of patients) are proposed and compared to the existing method to examine which method results in reduced <b>wait</b> <b>times.</b> The impacts of changing the resources (surgeon and OR) on <b>wait</b> <b>times</b> were analysed. The Manitoba Cataract Waiting List Program (MCWLP) priority system is simulated and compared to the existing FCFS policy to see whether the scheduling of patients for surgery based on priority improves <b>wait</b> <b>times.</b> Experimental results show that the two proposed methods significantly reduce <b>wait</b> <b>times.</b> It is found that Northern Health would meet the target <b>wait</b> <b>time</b> 2 (16 weeks) if one more OR (total of two ORs) is allocated for cataract surgery.
