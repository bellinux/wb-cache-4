5|$|Around 25–33% of <b>white</b> dwarfs have <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> {{in their}} spectra, which is notable because any heavy {{elements}} in a white dwarf should sink into the star's interior in just {{a small fraction of}} the star's lifetime. The prevailing explanation for metal-rich white dwarfs is that they have recently accreted rocky planetesimals. The bulk composition of the accreted object can be measured from the strengths of the <b>metal</b> <b>lines.</b> For example, a 2015 study of the white dwarf Ton 345 concluded that its metal abundances were consistent with those of a differentiated, rocky planet whose mantle had been eroded by the host star's wind during its asymptotic giant branch phase.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} {{collision}} broadening by He {{are central to}} understanding the opacity of cool stellar atmospheres. Aims. DZ <b>white</b> dwarfs show <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> which are, in many cases, believed to come from some rocky material, a remnant of a former exoplanetary system. The analysis of the Mg + resonance lines is a valuable method to determine the chemical abundances in these systems. Methods. Unified profiles of the strongest of the UV lines of Mg + have been calculated in the semi-classical approach using very recent ab initio potential energies. Results. We present the first theoretical line profile calculations of the resonance lines of Mg + that have been perturbed by helium in physical conditions of atmospheres in helium-rich <b>white</b> dwarfs with <b>metal</b> traces...|$|R
40|$|Single <b>metal</b> {{polluted}} <b>white</b> dwarfs with no dusty disks {{are believed}} to be actively accreting metals from a circumstellar disk of gas caused by the destruction of asteroids perturbed by planetary systems. We report, for the first time, the detection of circumstellar Ca II gas in absorption around the DAZ WD 1124 - 293, which lacks an infrared excess. We constrain the gas to > 7 R_ WD and R_⊕ using the WASP survey. The presence of gas in orbit around WD 1124 - 293 implies that most DAZs could harbor planetary systems. Since 25 - 30 % of <b>white</b> dwarfs show <b>metal</b> <b>line</b> absorption, the dynamical process for perturbing small bodies must be robust.

We present Spitzer IRAC photometry accurate to ∼ 3 % for four DAZs and one DA with circumstellar absorption lines in the UV. We search for excesses due to unseen companions or circumstellar dust disks. We use Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS imaging of these white dwarfs to gauge the level of background contamination to our targets as well as rule out common proper motion companions to WD 1620 - 391. All of our targets show no excesses due to companions> 20 MJ, ruling out all but very low mass companions to these white dwarfs at all separations. No excesses due to circumstellar disks are observed, and we place limits on what types of disks may still be present. Subject headings: circumstellar matter–planetary systems–white dwarf...|$|R

40|$|Hydrogen {{atmosphere}} <b>white</b> dwarfs with <b>metal</b> <b>lines,</b> so-called DAZs, show {{evidence for}} ongoing accretion of material onto their surfaces. Some DAZs {{are known to}} have unresolved M dwarf companions, which could account for the observed accretion through a stellar wind. I combine observed Ca abundances of the DAZs with information on the orbital separation of their M dwarf companions to infer the mass loss rate of the M dwarfs. I find that for three of the six known DAZs with M dwarf companions, a stellar wind can plausibly explain the observed accretion on the white dwarfs assuming Bondi-Hoyle accretion of solar abundance stellar winds on the order of 10 ^- 14 - 10 ^- 16 yr^- 1. The rest of the sample have companions with orbits 1 AU, and require companion mass loss rates of > 10 ^- 11 yr^- 1. I conclude that there must be an alternative explanation for accretion of material onto DAZs with widely separated companions. The inferred winds for two of the close binaries are orders of magnitude smaller than typically assumed for the angular momentum loss of red dwarf-white dwarf pairs due to magnetic braking from a stellar wind and may seriously affect predictions for the formation rate of CVs with low mass companions.

Precise cutting of these <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> {{is one of the}} fundamental requirements in VLSI Circuit Edit technology. Cutting of these sub micron <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> should ensure good electrical isolation while maintaining nil / minimal damage to closely spaced adjacent metal structures. In this experimental work, both focused ion beam (FIB) technology and focused Laser beam technology have been explored. Relative merits and demerits of these technologies have been discussed.

40|$|Previously {{the authors}} have {{presented}} both theoretical and experimental work discussing the operating mechanism of a wire rope held in a tapered socket {{by means of a}} cast resin cone. The work reported here extends the investigation to address {{the question of whether the}} same socket fabricated with <b>white</b> <b>metal</b> operates in the same manner. To date, previous investigations have compared the operational efficiency of resin and <b>white</b> <b>metal</b> in terms of both strength and/or fatigue endurance. Some other work has analysed the operation of resin sockets or specific cast metal terminations. This paper seeks to draw the results from this work together, and, in addition to a theoretical analysis, presents experimental data obtained from a direct comparison of the operation mechanism for the same sockets filled with resin or <b>white</b> <b>metal.</b> Results show that <b>white</b> <b>metal</b> terminations have a very different distribution of stresses along the length of the socket basket from resin terminations, and a smaller but still significant amount of socket draw. For both types of termination the socket draw develops high frictional gripping forces which can transfer the load from the rope to the socket. The different stress distributions mean that the consequences of termination fabrication defects may not be the same for resin and <b>white</b> <b>metal</b> terminations...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{technique}} for formation of <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> for electronic devices, and for reduction of resistivity in such <b>metal</b> <b>lines,</b> is proposed. In the technique, the <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> are formed in trenches by using functional liquids containing metal nanoparticles. The trenches are constructed on a plastic substrate by imprint of a patterned mold. When the whole {{surface of the}} plastic substrate {{is covered with a}} hydrophobic film, the hydrophobic property disappears only in the trenches due to the pressing process of the imprint, and thus the functional liquid automatically accumulates into the trenches. When the metallic functional liquid is modified with tween- 20 (polyoxyethylene- 20), <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> with a width of 10  μm are formed by capillary effect. The resistivity of such <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> can be lowered to the order of 10 ^  Ω[*]cm by exposing them to hydrogen atoms generated in vacuum by catalytic cracking of hydrogen molecules with heated tungsten wires...|$|R

40|$|In {{applications}} such as {{organic light emitting diodes}} (OLEDs) or photovoltaic cells a homogenous voltage distribution in the large anode layer needs to be ensured by including a metal grid with a transparent conductor layer. To ensure sufficient conductivity, relatively thick <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> are used, which increases the risk of electrical shorts between the anode and the cathode. For this reason an insulating layer is needed on top of the <b>metal</b> <b>lines.</b> The thick <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> limit the choice of deposition method, since some methods such as spin coating require smooth surfaces and cannot be used for applying the insulator. Here, a spray coating process has been studied as a potential alternative deposition method to create thin resistive layers on rough surfaces. Spray coating and Joule heating has been used for the alignment of insulator films on printed <b>metal</b> <b>lines.</b> It was demonstrated that spray coating can be used to cover the printed <b>metal</b> <b>lines</b> which have high peaks on them.
