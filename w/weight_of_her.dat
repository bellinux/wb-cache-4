25|$|In sailing qualities Boreas was broadly {{comparable}} with French frigates of equivalent size, {{but with a}} shorter and sturdier hull and greater weight in her broadside guns. She was also comparatively broad-beamed with ample space for provisions and the ship's mess, and incorporating a large magazine for powder and round shot. Taken together, these characteristics would enable Boreas to remain at sea for long periods without resupply. She was also built with broad and heavy masts, which balanced the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hull, improved stability in rough weather and made her capable of carrying a greater quantity of sail. The disadvantages of this comparatively heavy design were a decline in manoeuvrability and slower speed when sailing in light winds.|$|E

500|$|On 31 July 1862, {{under the}} command of Lieutenant Charles H. McBlair, Atlanta {{conducted}} her sea trials down the Savannah River toward Fort Pulaski. The ship proved to be difficult to steer, and the additional <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> armor and guns significantly reduced her speed and increased her draft. This latter was a real problem in the shallow waters near Savannah. She also leaked significantly, and her design virtually eliminated air circulation.

500|$|USS Roanoke was a wooden-hulled [...] screw frigate {{built for}} the United States Navy in the mid-1850s. She served as {{flagship}} of the Home Squadron in the late 1850s and captured several Confederate ships {{after the start of}} the American Civil War in 1861. The ship was converted into an ironclad monitor during 1862–63; the first ship with more than two gun turrets in history. Her conversion was not very successful as she rolled excessively and the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> armor and turrets strained her hull. Her deep draft meant that she could not operate off shallow Confederate ports and she was relegated to harbor defense at Hampton Roads, Virginia {{for the duration of the}} war. Roanoke was placed reserve after the war and sold for scrap in 1883.|$|E

500|$|Unlike her half-sisters, {{the entire}} side of Northumberlands hull was not covered with wrought iron armour.

60|$|Other {{four of the}} British vessels sailed {{ahead of}} the Vanguard and got into action. One of these--the Bellerophon (Captain Darby)--engaged the {{gigantic}} L'Orient, which was so disproportionately large that the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> ball from <b>her</b> lower deck alone exceeded that from the whole broadside <b>of</b> <b>her</b> assailant. The result was that the Bellerophon was overpowered, 200 <b>of</b> <b>her</b> men were killed or wounded, all her masts and cables were shot away, and she drifted out <b>of</b> the line. <b>Her</b> place, however, {{was taken by the}} Swiftsure, which not only assailed the L'Orient on the bow, {{but at the same time}} opened a steady fire on the quarter of the Franklin.|$|R

500|$|All of {{the ships}} had the same main armament, four quick-firing (QF) [...] Mark IX guns in single mounts, {{designated}} 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear.

The E- and F-class ships were fitted with two quadruple mounts for 21-inch (533mm) torpedo tubes. The ships, except for the minelayers, were also equipped with two throwers and one rack for 20 depth charges. The stern of the minelayers was fitted with a pair of sponsons that housed part of the mechanical chain-conveyor system and to ensure smooth delivery of her mines. To compensate for the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> Mark XIV mines, their rails, two 4.7-inch guns, their ammunition, both sets of torpedo tubes, their whalers and their davits had to be removed.|$|E
500|$|The {{vessel was}} named after the Levant, {{an area of the}} eastern Mediterranean. In {{selecting}} her name the Board of Admiralty continued a tradition, dating to 1644, of using geographic features. Overall, ten of the nineteen Coventry-class vessels, including Levant, [...] were named after well-known regions, rivers or towns. With few exceptions the remainder of the class were named after figures from classical antiquity, following a more modern trend initiated in 1748 by John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich in his capacity as First Lord of the Admiralty. In sailing qualities Levant was broadly comparable with French frigates of equivalent size, but with a shorter and sturdier hull and greater weight in her broadside guns. She was also comparatively broad-beamed which, when coupled with Adams' modifications, provided ample space for provisions, the ship's mess and a large magazine for powder and round shot. Taken together, these characteristics would enable Levant to remain at sea for long periods without resupply. She was also built with broad and heavy masts, which balanced the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hull, improved stability in rough weather and made her capable of carrying a greater quantity of sail.
