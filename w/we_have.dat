5|$|There is extant also an epistle of his to the Emperor Philip, {{and another}} to Severa his wife, with several others to {{different}} persons. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> arranged in distinct books {{to the number of}} one hundred, so that they might be no longer scattered, as many of these as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been able to collect, which have been preserved here and there by different persons.|$|E

6000|$|On {{gaining the}} camp, however, I found, to my sorrow, that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> done the thing only too vigorously; for <b>we</b> <b>had</b> not only put the enemy to flight, but <b>we</b> <b>had</b> also frightened away those whom <b>we</b> <b>had</b> come to deliver! ...|$|R

"Before <b>we</b> <b>had</b> any village teachers, {{we created}} village schools, and before <b>we</b> <b>had</b> any professors, <b>we</b> opened universities, and thus we falsified public instruction. Before <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a culture {{outside of the}} schools, we created the Romanian Atheneum and {{cultural}} associations, and we despised {{the spirit of the}} literary societies. Before <b>we</b> <b>had</b> even a shade of original scientific activity, we created the Romanian Academic Society, with philological, historical-archaeological, natural sciences departments, and we falsified the idea of an Academy. Before <b>we</b> <b>had</b> any notable artists, we created the Music Conservatory; before <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a single worthy painter, we created the fine art schools; before <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a single valuable play, we founded the National Theatre, and we devalued and falsified all these forms of culture." ...|$|R

25|$|I {{think that}} in some quarters, {{many parts of the}} country, a white male is really disadvantaged… Because <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{developed}} this notion of women and minorities being so disadvantaged and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to help them, that <b>we</b> <b>have,</b> in many cases, twisted the thing so that it's no longer a case of equal opportunity.

6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> {{undergone}} this ordeal two {{or three}} times. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> tramped over fields. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> waded through brooks and scrambled over hedges and walls. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> had a row as to whose fault it was that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> first lost our way. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> got thoroughly disagreeable, footsore, and weary. But throughout it all the hope of that duck kept us up. A fairy-like vision, it floated before our tired eyes and drew us onward. The thought of it was as a trumpet-call to the fainting. We talked of it and cheered each other with our recollections of it. [...] "Come along," [...] we said; [...] "the duck will be spoiled." ...|$|R

The situation had reversed itself: before, we'd had the keys but <b>we</b> hadn't <b>had</b> the machine — we solved the machine; now <b>we</b> <b>had</b> the machine but <b>we</b> didn't <b>have</b> the keys. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> to work out methods to find the daily keys.|$|R
60|$|I {{have often}} {{wondered}} since, if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> had at our hand as many stones as {{could have been}} used, {{what would have been}} the result? But even that poor method of warfare was denied us, for the supply <b>we</b> <b>had</b> gathered was speedily expended, and, what was worse, the fact that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> ceased to shoot bullets showed the Britishers plainly the plight into which <b>we</b> <b>had</b> fallen.|$|R

5000|$|<b>We</b> <b>had</b> no money, but <b>we</b> <b>had</b> each other!

We seldom got new clothes, but we wore hand-me-downs, unless my mother would buy {{materials}} and make our clothes. We lived in poverty, but we learned the value of hard work. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> no running water or electricity. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> no TV, Internet or cell phone. Yet, we were very happy because <b>we</b> <b>had</b> life! <b>We</b> <b>had</b> each other! Today, all 15 children in my family of origin are most grateful for the sacrifices Mom and Dad made so that <b>we</b> could <b>have</b> life. Making sacrifices for each other brought us incredible joy and enhanced our dignity, because it gave {{us a chance to}} participate in serving each other! ...|$|R
