25|$|Sarafian {{wanted to}} score the {{majority}} of the film from an album called Motel Shot by Delaney, Bonnie & Friends. Lionel Newman, head of Fox's music department at the time, denied Sarafian's request because the studio did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> substantial amount of money obtaining rights to the tracks. The director then suggested that musician Randy Newman score the film, but Fox refused this request as well. After watching the film, musical supervisor Jimmy Bowen wrote three original songs. Delaney, Bonnie & Friends ended up performing a musical number in the film.|$|E
500|$|The writers did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> {{lot of time}} {{covering}} Jason's childhood experiences, {{which they}} felt would remove the sense of mystery from the character. They tried to write scenes that would add verisimilitude, like the audience finding a deer carcass {{lying on the ground}} as they follow Jason through his underground tunnels. Fuller told the writers they would have to do without it because it would cost [...] $100,000. [...] Because of budget constraints, certain character deaths and the ending of the film were also scaled back from what Shannon and Swift originally envisioned.|$|E
500|$|Jim and Abby {{discuss the}} book From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler and talk {{whether they would}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> night in the Metropolitan Museum of Art or an aquarium. Sasha asks Phyllis if she is Mother Goose. Dwight later reads the short story [...] "Die Geschichte vom Daumenlutscher" [...] from Heinrich Hoffmann's 1845 book Struwwelpeter. Michael later refers {{to it as a}} book that Dwight's [...] "Nazi war-criminal" [...] {{grandmother}} read to him. This starts a short discussion about Nazis. Michael argues that Dunder Mifflin is better than Office Depot with the children. He later shows them his performance on Fundle Bundle, a parody of [...] "those crappy little local kids' shows that used to fill time on Saturday mornings before there were such things as infomercials". Michael and Dwight end the party by performing Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young's [...] "Teach Your Children".|$|E

2500|$|Buffett {{described}} {{the health care}} reform under President Barack Obama as insufficient to deal with the costs of health care in the US, though he supports its aim of expanding health insurance coverage. Buffett compared health care costs to a tapeworm, saying that they compromise US economic competitiveness by increasing manufacturing costs. Buffett thinks health care costs should head towards 13 to 14% of GDP. (Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the CMS actuary has projected health care costs will reach almost 20% of GDP by 2020.) Buffett said [...] "If you want the very best, I mean if you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> million dollars to prolong your life 3 months in a coma or something then the US is probably the best", but he also said that other countries spend much less and receive much more in health care value (visits, hospital beds, doctors and nurses per capita).|$|E

25|$|After {{the show}} closed Modotti {{returned}} to California, and Weston {{and she made}} {{plans to return to}} Mexico together.

60|$|After the {{depression}} following the first shock, Mr Brandon endeavored to stiffen himself. There {{was a great}} deal of pride in him, and if he was obliged to go to the altar, he did not wish his old friends to suppose that he was going there to be sacrificed. He had brought this dreadful thing upon himself, but he would try to stand up like a man, and bear it; and, after all, it might not be for long; the Widow Keswick was a good deal older than he was. Other thoughts occasionally came to comfort him; she could not make him continually live with her, and he had plans for visits to Richmond, and even to New York; and, better than that, she might <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> good deal of time at her own farm.|$|E

5000|$|It {{is unclear}} how much of Boleskine House remains since the fire, {{although}} the former owner, Mrs. MacGillivray said that since {{the extent of the}} damage is so bad it [...] "is unlikely it will ever be rebuilt unless there is someone out there with an interest in the occult <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> lot of money."

50|$|Although {{many people}} see in camping {{a chance to}} get out of the daily routine and improve their {{survival}} skills, others would rather benefit from the many amenities that campsites are nowadays equipped with.

5000|$|On a broad level, one can {{visualize}} {{that more}} the material, lesser {{will be the}} deflection as there is more material to resist the loads. So, the optimization requires an opposing constraint, the volume constraint [...] This is in reality a cost factor, as we would not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> {{lot of money on}} the material. To obtain the total material utilized, an integration of the selection field over the volume can be done.|$|E

50|$|The Stichting Studiefonds voor Zuid-Afrikaanse Studenten was {{established}} in 1885 and provided bursaries for South African students that wanted to spend 3 to 6 months in the Netherlands, typically {{as part of an}} exchange programme between Dutch and South African students in the humanities.

5000|$|Despite Bernhard's claim, William Holden {{was also}} {{considered}} for the role. Holden turned it down, claiming he didnâ€™t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> star in a film about the Devil. Holden later would portray Thorn's brother, Richard, in the sequel, Damien: Omen II (1978). [...] A firm offer was made to Charlton Heston on July 19, 1975.

40|$|The {{title of}} this paper {{came out of a}} {{conversation}} I had on a recent trip to Canada. I had gone there because I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> bit of time seeing how non-government organisations in Canada were faring in this age of re inventing government. Osborne and Gaebler (1992) I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> try and understand whether there were any lessons in the Canadian experience, that might be relevant for Australia. As I hope to demonstrate while there are both similarities and differences, the questions facing both nations have a remarkable correspondence...|$|R
50|$|A further {{challenge}} to Little Chef was {{the rise of}} pub restaurants which catered both for the business and family markets. Recently refurbished service stations began to offer additional choices such as Marks & Spencer Simply Food and coffee chains such as Costa in place of Little Chef outlets, which appealed <b>to</b> people not <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> long time over a meal. Furthermore, {{the construction of the}} motorway network meant that A-roads (along which Little Chef outlets were usually situated) were no longer used for long-distance travel.|$|R
