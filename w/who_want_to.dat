5|$|Yajnavalkya {{states that}} there are two paths to attain {{knowledge}}.

The Pravritti-karma path is the cause for suffering and rebirth, while the Nivritti-karma is liberating and practiced by those <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> end suffering and rebirth.|$|E
5|$|About 222million women <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> avoid {{pregnancy}} {{in developing}} countries are not using a modern birth control method. Birth control use {{in developing countries}} has decreased {{the number of deaths}} during or around the time of pregnancy by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% if the full demand for birth control were met. By lengthening the time between pregnancies, birth control can improve adult women's delivery outcomes and the survival of their children. In the developing world women's earnings, assets, weight, and their children's schooling and health all improve with greater access to birth control. Birth control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children, more women participating in the workforce, and less use of scarce resources.|$|E

But we decided to change it a little bit. Instead of the olive branch, we had an apple tree branch, since the Ramones were American as apple pie. And since Johnny was such a baseball fanatic, we had the eagle hold a baseball bat instead of the 's arrows.|$|E
