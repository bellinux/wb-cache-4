And if this be confused with the argument that she came in an age of clarity and scepticism, uncontaminated by old superstitions, it could still be retorted that the works of superstition have survived the works of scepticism. But the truth is, of course, that the real quality of America is much more subtle and complex than this; and is mixed not only of good and bad, and rational and mystical, but also of old and new. That is what makes the task of tracing the true proportions of American life so interesting and so impossible.|$|E

The different tales, taken as a whole, present us contradictory pictures of the female’s status in the Celticsocieties.

The Celtic women, married or single, could play different functions including religious ones. Besides that, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> their important role as masters of weapons, of arts, of magic and as sexual initiators.

The other is that the reactions actually take place {{on the surface of the}} catalyst, while the temperature we used in the reaction rate is the gas temperature (and not the temperature of the surface of the catalyst). These can be considered as some kind of approximations but, nevertheless, our results match well with the experimental data provided by Magneti Marelli [13].|$|R

3000|$|Remark 2 In [35], by {{constructing}} a differential-difference type learning law and an adaptive learning control law, {{based on the}} Lyapunov-Krasovskii-like CEF method, a novel sufficient condition was derived to ensure adaptive asymptotical synchronization in the mean square sense for stochastic delayed RDNNs with unknown time-varying coupling strengths. Why do we study the pinning synchronization of linearly coupled RDNNs with unknown time-varying coupling strengths and unknown time-varying delay in this paper? As we know now, real-world complex networks normally have {{a large number of}} nodes. So it is usually difficult to control a complex network by adding the controllers to all nodes.

Although at first sight the new procedures {{have a positive impact on}} the development of intra-Community commercial businesses, due to the elimination of customs formalities and hence of the fees paid to customs officials, however there are costs generated by the application of EU law, which should not be neglected. Considering the many situations that arise in carrying out intra-Community commercial transactions, that are aimed at the differentiated tax procedures from the value added tax perspective, we considered appropriate, to address below the tax features related to intra-Community acquisitions and supplies of new means of transport and excisable products, because these are two important categories of goods that generate differential tax treatments, so that after the tax analysis <b>we</b> <b>should</b> be able to draw some relevant conclusions...|$|R

So, crew offices make real-time rescheduling of crew operation {{according to the}} rescheduling of trains by dispatchers. Any error in location identification of the crew members concerned, in rescheduling or in delivery of information and instructions adversely may disrupt the train schedule more. There have been actual cases in the past of such troubles, in which location identifica-tion of some crew members and delivery of information and instruc-tions took so much time that crew assignment could not be complet-ed in time for rescheduled departure time of some trains. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> some reasons behind that are train radios and telephones being {{the only way of}} communication between crew offices and individual crew members and that rescheduling of crew operation is done manually relying only upon the attention and experience-based decision of the managers in charge.

40|$|In September 1994 an {{outbreak}} of gastroenteritis occurred in 437 people who had consumed lunch in the canteen of a factory in Central Italy. Salmonella sp. was isolated from stools of 99 patients and in 73 of them Salmonella hadar was identified. This is the first outbreak caused by this serotype described in Italy. In order to examine the genotypic basis of the epidemic strains, molecular typing was applied to sporadic strains isolated {{before and after the}} outbreak episode. For this purpose phage type, resistance to antibiotics, DNA plasmid profile and sites of insertion of the mobile element of IS 200 were determined. The epidemic strains were genetically distinct from the non-epidemic isolates; they were shown to be phage type 26, harbouring four small plasmids, were resistant to nalidixic acid and showed a unique characteristic IS 200 fingerprint. The typing methods used in this study allowed the identification and discrimination of the outbreak strains from related isolates. They can thus be considered as a tool for epidemiological purposes. In addition <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> the emerging resistance to nalidixic acid, largely used in veterinary medicine, in Salm. hadar...|$|R
