5|$|Baleen whales {{have two}} {{flippers}} on the front, near the head. Like all mammals, baleen whales breathe air and must surface periodically to do so. Their nostrils, or blowholes, are {{situated at the}} top of the cranium. Baleen whales have two blowholes, as opposed to toothed whales which have one. These paired blowholes are longitudinal slits that converge anteriorly and widen posteriorly, which causes a V-shaped blow. They are surrounded by a fleshy ridge that keeps water away while the whale breathes. The septum that separates the blowholes has two plugs attached to it, making the blowholes <b>water-tight</b> while the whale dives.|$|E
5|$|On {{a meeting}} on 10 October, O. T. Blindheim, a {{geological}} consulting company, and Selmer presented three alternatives: continued injection of cement, recommended by Blindheim; freezing, recommended by Selmer {{because it was the}} cheapest, but would take more time; and use of a <b>water-tight</b> shield. A technical committee was established, and on 16 December they recommended the use of cement injection combined with a ring of drainage holes around the tunnel before blasting. The method was to be continually tested, and if it was insufficient, freezing could be used. As the tunnel advanced, the hole was to be continuously secured using carbon fibre-reinforced carbon gunite, self-boring bolts, steel ribs and full pouring. Work was taken up after {{a meeting on}} 27 March 1995, and on 16 August the final blast was made. Representatives from Selmer stated that the method they had chosen had resulted in international interest for the tunnel, and they had demonstrated it to several international delegations.|$|E
5|$|Taller, heavier {{buildings}} such as skyscrapers {{also required}} stronger foundations than smaller buildings. Earlier buildings had typically rested their foundations on rubble, {{which was in}} turn laid down on the soft top layer of the ground called the overburden. As buildings became taller and heavier, the overburden could not support their weight, and foundations increasingly needed to rest directly on the bedrock below. In both New York and Chicago this required digging down a considerable distance through soft soil and often below the water table, risking the hole filling up with water before the foundations were complete. The deeper the foundations needed to be, the greater the challenge. Special <b>water-tight</b> boxes called caissons were invented {{to deal with this}} problem in England in 1830 and adopted in the U.S. during the 1850s and 1860s.|$|E
25|$|The first-generation Molteno {{and other}} nonvalved {{implants}} sometimes require the ligation {{of the tube}} until the bleb formed is mildly fibrosed and <b>water-tight.</b> This is done to reduce postoperative hypotony—sudden drops in postoperative intraocular pressure.|$|E
25|$|The Senator did not {{immediately}} sink {{as a result of}} the explosion, probably because of several <b>water-tight</b> compartments, but instead drifted downstream and beached opposite the Oregon Steamship Company dock, after which the stern sank until the stern-wheel was under water, but the bow remained above the surface.|$|E
25|$|The valve closet has a valve or flap at {{the exit}} of the bowl with a <b>water-tight</b> seal to retain {{a pool of water}} in the pan. When the toilet is flushed, the valve is opened and the water in the pan flows rapidly out of the bowl into the drains, {{carrying}} the waste with it.|$|E
25|$|The Montgomery-class cruisers {{were three}} {{unprotected}} cruisers {{built for the}} United States Navy in the early 1890s. They had a thin <b>water-tight</b> protective deck, and also relied for protection upon their coal bunkers, cellulose packing, and numerous compartments. Roomy accommodations were provided for officers and crew, these cruisers being mainly intended for long cruises on distant stations.|$|E
25|$|The {{lifeboat}} {{is completely}} <b>water-tight</b> {{allowing it to}} self-right with up to 60 people on board. The boat {{has the potential to}} carry a maximum of 120 passengers on board, but without self-righting capability. The Survivors Space has room for 10 sitting and 8 standing. The Survivors Space is accessed either through the Wheelhouse or the fore deck Emergency Escape Hatch.|$|E
25|$|At 12, Courtney {{built his}} first boat out of hemlock boards and two inch planks {{that he had}} found. Due to his poor {{workmanship}} he plastered yellow clay on his boat to keep it <b>water-tight.</b> Once on the water the clay would eventually be washed away. This did not stop him and his friends from racing the boat. They would take turns to see who row it the farthest before it sank.|$|E
25|$|PEX is a medium- to {{high-density}} polyethylene containing cross-link bonds {{introduced into the}} polymer structure, changing the thermoplastic into a thermoset. The high-temperature properties of the polymer are improved, its flow is reduced, and its chemical resistance is enhanced. PEX is used in some potable-water plumbing systems because tubes made of the material can be expanded to fit over a metal nipple and it will slowly return to its original shape, forming a permanent, <b>water-tight</b> connection.|$|E
25|$|Glass aquaria {{have been}} a popular choice for many home and {{hobbyist}} aquarists for many years. Once silicone sealant became strong enough to ensure a long-term <b>water-tight</b> seal, it eliminated {{the need for a}} structural frame. In addition to lower cost, glass aquaria are more scratch resistant than acrylic. Although the price {{is one of the main}} considerations for aquarists when deciding which of these two types of aquaria to purchase, for very large tanks, the price difference tends to disappear.|$|E
25|$|For {{generation}} II reactors {{located in}} flood or tsunami prone areas, a 3+ day supply of back-up batteries {{has become an}} informal industry standard. Another change is to harden the location of back-up diesel generator rooms with <b>water-tight,</b> blast-resistant doors and heat sinks, {{similar to those used}} by nuclear submarines. The oldest operating nuclear power station in the world, Beznau, which has been operating since 1969, has a 'Notstand' hardened building designed to support all of its systems independently for 72hours {{in the event of an}} earthquake or severe flooding. This system was built prior to Fukushima Daiichi.|$|E
25|$|There {{had been}} a flash fire that caused {{considerable}} smoldering and heavy smoke from the explosion. Some sailors were overcome and perished due to this dense smoke. Fire control parties were initially confused because they found no active fires. Crew members responding to the General Quarters alarm closed <b>water-tight</b> doors, hatches and vents. This, with outstanding damage control work, kept Helena afloat. Crew members in the engineering sections {{had to resort to}} gas masks due to the smoke. The dead were taken dockside after the first attack was concluded. The wounded initially were taken to sickbay and by 1000 hours many were en route to the Naval Hospital.|$|E
25|$|Loading a {{submarine}} was a lengthy process that took weeks. The {{first step was}} to pump the forward ballast tanks empty which elevated the bow out of the water. Once it was dismantled, the ballast tanks were then filled to lower the bow and flood the well deck to allow the submarine to be winched aboard. The well deck's <b>water-tight</b> doors were then closed and the water in the dock was pumped overboard while the submarine settled onto its wooden bilge blocks. The bow was then reassembled and hatch covers were installed over the well deck. These prevented the ship from taking on water during a storm and allowed the crew to perform any necessary maintenance on the submarine while under way.|$|E
25|$|Difficulties in {{acquiring}} valley oak wood {{as well as}} issues stemming from its drying such as cracking and warping have shifted its consumption from a general purpose lumber to a primarily niche product. Valley oak wood has a small, but significant market for use in cabinetry though, and is also suitable for hardwood flooring. Tyloses present in the pores of valley oak wood increases its impermeability to fluids allowing it {{to be used in}} the production of <b>water-tight</b> vessels. Such vessels include wine barrels where valley oak wood sees limited role in the composition of and where it has similar properties to other white oaks such as a reduced tannin load compared to the red oaks and an open grain that allows for an increased transfer of oxygen.|$|E
25|$|The early reptile-like {{amphibians}} {{were mostly}} aquatic, the first highly terrestrially adapted groups being the Seymouriamorpha and the Diadectomorpha. The seymouriamorphs were small to medium-sized animals with stout limbs, their remains are sometimes found {{in what has}} been interpreted as dry environments, indicating their skin had a <b>water-tight</b> epidermal horny overlay or even scales as evident in Discosauriscus. Their skeletons are very similar to those of early reptiles, though finds of seymouriamorph tadpoles have shown they retained an amphibian reproduction. The Diadectomorphan families are generally considered to be the closest known relatives of modern amniotes. They too are thought to have been on the amphibian side of the divide, despite no known diadectomorph fossil tadpoles. Analysis of new finds and composition of larger trees do however indicate the phylogeny may not be as well understood as traditionally thought.|$|E
25|$|An {{anastomosis}} is {{a surgical}} {{connection between the}} stomach and bowel, or between {{two parts of the}} bowel. The surgeon attempts to create a <b>water-tight</b> connection by connecting the two organs with either staples or sutures, either of which actually makes a hole in the bowel wall. The surgeon will rely on the body's natural healing abilities and its ability to create a seal, like a self-sealing tire, to succeed with the surgery. If that seal fails to form for any reason, fluid from within the gastrointestinal tract can leak into the sterile abdominal cavity and give rise to infection and abscess formation. Leakage of an anastomosis can occur in about 2% of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and less than 1% in mini gastric bypass. Leaks usually occur at the stomach-intestine connection (gastro-jejunostomy). There is a change in the drain fluid contents from serous (before the leak) to fecal/bilious (after the leak). Usually significant leaks need urgent re-operation. Sometimes a minor leakage can be treated with antibiotics only. It is usually safer to re-operate if an infection cannot be definitely controlled immediately.|$|E
500|$|To {{protect against}} {{underwater}} explosions, {{the ship was}} fitted with longitudinal torpedo bulkheads 1 to [...] inches thick that ran from the forward to the rear magazines. During her 1921 refit, Royal Sovereign was fitted with an anti-torpedo bulge that {{ran the length of}} the ship between the fore and aft barbettes. It was divided into a <b>water-tight</b> empty lower compartment and an upper compartment filled with <b>water-tight</b> [...] "crushing tubes" [...] intended to absorb and distribute the force of an explosion. The space between the tubes was filled with wood and cement.|$|E
500|$|The X1s [...] thick {{pressure}} hull was [...] in diameter amidships, and {{was divided into}} 10 <b>water-tight</b> compartments. This was almost completely surrounded by her external hull, which also contained the main ballast tanks and most of her fuel. Her intended maximum diving depth was , but was reduced to [...] once in service.|$|E
500|$|For {{protection}} against torpedoes, {{she was given}} a [...] deep anti-torpedo bulge that {{ran the length of}} the ship between the fore and aft barbettes. It was divided into an empty outer compartment and an inner compartment filled with five rows of <b>water-tight</b> [...] "crushing tubes" [...] intended to absorb and distribute the force of an explosion. The bulge was backed by a 1.5-inch-thick torpedo bulkhead.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of the pre-cast girders and deck panels were constructed in Tacoma, Washington and shipped by [...] barge. [...] The three concrete pontoons for the floating moveable span were also constructed in Tacoma by Concrete Technology Corporation in a graving dock and floated to Ford Island by barge in three shipments. [...] They are [...] long, [...] wide, and [...] tall, and contain 21 <b>water-tight</b> air-filled cells with leak detectors to provide buoyancy. [...] The three sections were assembled at the site using large steel bolts.|$|E
500|$|Restoration work {{involved}} {{a collaboration between}} staff from British Waterways and volunteer labour. In 1966 Sulhamstead Lock was rebuilt and the re-puddling of the dry section at Limpley Stoke was begun. In 1968, restoration work was undertaken on the Bath Locks and Burghfield Lock. In Reading at Bridge Street the navigable headroom had been reduced from [...] to [...] by girders added to {{the underside of the}} bridge. This was replaced with a new bridge, enabling craft to pass more easily. The canal was reopened from the Thames to Hungerford Wharf in July 1974. Re-puddling was a long process, so experiments with the use of heavy gauge polythene to line the canal were undertaken. The Avoncliff Aqueduct was lined with a concrete [...] "cradle" [...] and made <b>water-tight</b> in 1980.|$|E
500|$|A Royal Navy {{review board}} judged that a {{contributory}} {{factor in the}} loss was that Audacious was not at action stations, with <b>water-tight</b> doors locked and damage control teams ready. Attempts were made to use the engine circulating pumps as additional bilge pumps, but the rapid rise of water prevented this. Although hatches were open {{at the time of}} the explosion, it was claimed that all were closed before rising water reached them. [...] Apart from the damage to the bottom of the ship, water was found to have spread through bulkheads because of faulty seals around pipes and valves, broken pipes and hatches which did not close properly. [...] , of the subsequent (but fairly similar) , was torpedoed at Jutland and for a time continued to steam at [...] despite damage.|$|E
500|$|Allocated {{project number}} A-102, the Nagato class was {{designed}} before Commander Yuzuru Hiraga was reassigned to the Navy Technical Department (NTD) responsible for ship design, although Hiraga is often {{credited with the}} design of these ships. In contrast to earlier designs, the Nagato class used the American [...] "all or nothing" [...] armor scheme that maximized the armor thickness protecting {{the core of the}} ship by eliminating armor elsewhere. The design had two armored decks of medium thickness rather than the single thicker deck used formerly. The ships also used a new type of underwater protection system that successfully resisted penetration by [...] torpedo warheads in full-scale trials. It consisted of a deep <b>water-tight</b> compartment adjacent to the hull, backed by a thick torpedo bulkhead that connected to the side and deck armor plates, with a deep fuel oil tank behind it.|$|E
500|$|The six deep-level {{stations}} are built as rectangular, open boxes [...] long, [...] wide and [...] deep. The platforms are located [...] below the surface. Access {{to the surface}} is reached via escalators and elevators. The design allows the stations to be located below streets and squares, allowing the stations to be built without expropriation. Access to the track is blocked by platform screen doors. The underground stations were built as cut-and-cover {{from the top down}} (except Christianshavn, which was excavated as a large hole and the station built bottom-up), and the first part of construction was building a <b>water-tight</b> wall on all sides. There are glass pyramids {{on the roof of the}} stations permitting daylight to enter. Inside the pyramids, there are prisms reflecting and splitting the light, sometimes resulting in rainbows on the walls. The light in the stations is automatically regulated to make best use of the daylight and maintain a constant level of illumination of the stations at all times.|$|E
500|$|Post-war {{analysis}} by the U.S. Naval Technical Mission to Japan noted that Shinano had serious design flaws. Specifically, the joint between the waterline armor belt on the upper hull and the anti-torpedo bulge on the underwater portion was poorly designed, a trait shared by the Yamato-class battleships; Archerfishs torpedoes all exploded along this joint. The force of the torpedo explosions also dislodged an I-beam {{in one of the}} boiler rooms which punched a hole into another boiler room. In addition, the failure to test for water-tightness in each compartment played a role as potential leaks could not be found and patched before Shinano put to sea. The executive officer blamed the large amount of water that entered the ship on the failure to air-test the compartments for leaks. [...] He reported hearing air rushing through gaps in the <b>water-tight</b> doors just minutes after the last torpedo hit—a sign that seawater was rapidly entering the ship, proving the doors were unseaworthy.|$|E
500|$|The {{main deck}} armor {{consisted}} of three layers of high-tensile steel (HTS) [...] thick that connected {{to the top of}} the upper strake of side armor. The flat portion of the lower deck had one layer of Ducol steel 25mm thick with two layers of HTS of equal thickness above it. About [...] from the side of the hull, this deck, now composed of three layers of HTS, totaling [...] in thickness, sloped downwards where it met a short horizontal armored (three layers of HTS with a total thickness of [...] ) deck that connected to the main armored belt and the torpedo bulkhead. This was also made up of three 25mm layers of HTS and curved up and outwards to meet the short horizontal armored deck. It enclosed a <b>water-tight</b> compartment that was [...] from the side of the ship. It was backed by fuel oil tanks [...] deep. The outermost void was designed to allow the explosive force of a torpedo's warhead to dissipate as much as possible while the oil tank was supposed to stop any fragments from penetrating the innermost bulkhead protecting the ship's vital areas.|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} time since the A class of the 1927 programme, the {{flotilla}} leaders were built to an enlarged design, being lengthened to incorporate an additional QF 4.7-inch gun between the funnels. The lengthened design resulted in a three boiler room layout to enhance <b>water-tight</b> integrity. The leaders were not fitted for minesweeping or minelaying. They displaced [...] at standard load and [...] at deep load. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of [...] and a draught of [...] The ships carried a total of 175 personnel which included the staff of the Captain (D), commanding officer of the flotilla. Their turbines were [...] more powerful than the private ships, which made them [...] faster; their propulsion machinery was otherwise identical. [...] was an early wartime loss and consequently received no modifications, but [...] survived the war. Her modifications differed somewhat from those of the private ships. She received a [...] AA gun in lieu of her aft torpedo tubes, although they were later reinstalled and the 4-inch gun replaced 'X' 4.7-inch gun. Two Oerlikons were later added on the forward part of her aft superstructure and a quadruple QF two-pounder [...] "pom-pom" [...] mount replaced 'Q' gun between the funnels. Finally her rangefinder was replaced by a high-angle director fitted with a Type 285 gunnery radar.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{revolves}} around the fictionalized figure of Bolívar and includes many minor characters {{who are part of}} the General's travelling party, whom he meets on his journey or who come to him in his memories and dreams of his past. Sometimes they are identified by particular quirks or tied to small but significant events. They include, for instance, General José María Carreño, a member of the entourage, whose right arm was amputated after a combat wound, and who once revealed a military secret by talking in his sleep. At other times, they are prostheses for the General's now failing powers: Fernando, for example, the General's nephew, is [...] "the most willing and patient of the General's many clerks", and the General wakes him [...] "at any hour to have him read aloud from a dull book or take notes on urgent extemporizations". One of the least developed of the minor characters is the General's wife, María Teresa Rodríguez del Toro y Alayza, who had died, readers are told, in mysterious circumstances shortly after their marriage. The General has [...] "buried her {{at the bottom of a}} <b>water-tight</b> oblivion as a brutal means of living without her"; she only fleetingly enters his memories in the book's last chapter. According to Menton, she is [...] "upstaged" [...] by Manuela Sáenz, whose later history García Márquez recounts as if she instead were the General's widow. María Teresa's death, however, marked the General's [...] "birth into history", and he has never tried to replace her.|$|E
2500|$|Servia was {{the first}} major ocean liner to be built of steel, which gave her large hull the {{advantage}} of additional strength {{while at the same time}} making her lighter. She was also the first liner to re-introduce the cellular double-bottom design which Brunel had invented 20 years earlier for the Great Eastern. The double-bottom was 4' 8" [...] deep, and could be flooded with 800 tons of water ballast. Because Servia was built to admirality specifications, she incorporated several safety features, the most notable being the sub-division of her hull into 12 transverse <b>water-tight</b> compartments, fitted with <b>water-tight</b> doors. She could remain afloat with any two of these compartments flooded. The <b>water-tight</b> doors between the boiler and engine room were fail-safe and could be closed from any deck.|$|E
2500|$|Ahmed Hamdi Tunnel (...) {{south of}} the Great Bitter Lake (...) was built in 1983. Because of leakage problems, a new <b>water-tight</b> tunnel was built inside the old one from 1992 to 1995.|$|E
2500|$|Annualized geo solar {{buildings}} {{often have}} buried, sloped <b>water-tight</b> skirts of insulation that extend [...] from the foundations, to prevent heat leakage between the earth used as thermal mass, and the surface.|$|E
2500|$|The hull {{design of}} Akitsushima was based closely on {{that of the}} last vessel to be {{constructed}} in the Matsushima class, namely [...] , retaining the same double-bottom hull construction, <b>water-tight</b> compartments and the same machinery. She was the last ship in Japan to be built of imported steel.|$|E
2500|$|Kursk was reputedly unsinkable. The {{submarine}} had {{a double}} hull with a [...] gap separating them, nine <b>water-tight</b> compartments, and was {{as long as}} two jumbo jets.
