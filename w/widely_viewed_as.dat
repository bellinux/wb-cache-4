5|$|Mahaleo is a folk-pop {{band from}} Madagascar that is <b>widely</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> {{the most popular}} Malagasy group of all time. The band was founded by Dama (Rasolofondraosolo Zafimahaleo) with six of his classmates after first {{performing}} together during the rotaka student protests at their high school on 13 May 1972. Mahaleo's lyrics draw upon the indirect language of traditional hainteny and ohabolana (Malagasy poetry and proverbs) to expose contemporary political and social issues and invite listeners to identify their own solutions.|$|E
5|$|The Sugar Act {{provoked}} outrage in Boston, {{where it}} was <b>widely</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a violation of colonial rights. Men such as James Otis and Samuel Adams argued that because the colonists were not represented in Parliament, {{they could not be}} taxed by that body; only the colonial assemblies, where the colonists were represented, could levy taxes upon the colonies. Hancock was not yet a political activist; however, he criticized the tax for economic, rather than constitutional, reasons.|$|E
5|$|Jason Chaffetz {{initially}} {{declared his}} candidacy to challenge McCarthy, and Bill Flores declared his candidacy after McCarthy withdrew, but both dropped out later {{to express their}} support for Paul Ryan, who entered the race after being <b>widely</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a potential frontrunner. Daniel Webster of the Republican Party and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi of the Democratic Party were also declared candidates. Ryan won the rescheduled caucus vote on October 28, and was elected Speaker of the House the next day, with 236 votes to Pelosi's 184 and Webster's 9. Three votes went to undeclared candidates.|$|E

5000|$|Released to {{critical}} acclaim, Star Control II is <b>widely</b> <b>viewed</b> today <b>as</b> {{one of the}} greatest PC games ever made, and has appeared on numerous publications lists of the greatest video games of all time ...|$|R
50|$|The Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade gives {{rules for}} the use of such barriers. However, trade experts <b>widely</b> <b>view</b> TBTs <b>as</b> having great {{potential}} for being misused by importing countries as nontransparent (disguised or unclear) obstacles to trade. (See Transparency.).|$|R
5|$|Secretariat was <b>widely</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> the {{favorite}} to win by most sportswriters and people; however, the added distance {{and the possibility of}} running too slow for a distance or running too fast too soon could potentially cause him to lose. Out of the starting gate, Secretariat and Sham traded the lead. Around the three-quarters mile marker Sham began to fade and Secretariat began to extend an advantage. Twice a Prince and Our Native overtook Sham to take second and third, respectively. Sham finished last, behind Pvt. Smiles, who was in last before Sham slowed severely.|$|E
5|$|Jefferson Davis {{served in}} many roles. As a soldier, he was brave and resourceful. As a politician, {{he served as}} a United States senator and a Mississippi congressman and was active and accomplished, {{although}} he never completed a full term in any elected position. As a plantation owner, he employed slave labor as did most of his peers in the South, and supported slavery. As president of the Confederate States of America, he is <b>widely</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> an ineffective wartime leader; although the task of defending the Confederacy against the much stronger Union would have been a great challenge for any leader, Davis's performance in this role is considered poor. After the war, he contributed to reconciliation of the South with the North, but remained a symbol for Southern pride.|$|E
5|$|General Hubert Gough {{commanded}} a mounted infantry regiment with distinction during {{the relief of}} Ladysmith, but his command was destroyed while attacking a larger Boer force in 1901. When he joined the BEF, he was {{in command of the}} 3rd Cavalry Brigade, and was promoted from a brigade to a corps command in less than a year. He was given command of the 2nd Cavalry Division in September 1914, the 7th Division in April 1915, and the British I Corps in July 1915. He commanded I Corps during the battle of Loos. In May 1916, he was appointed commander of the Fifth Army, which suffered heavy losses at the battle of Passchendaele. The collapse of the Fifth Army was <b>widely</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> the reason for the German breakthrough in the Spring Offensive, and Gough was dismissed as its commander in March 1918, being succeeded by General William Birdwood for the last months of the war. Birdwood had previously commanded the Australian Corps, an appointment requiring a combination of tact and tactical flair.|$|E

25|$|Multiple {{conflicting}} {{theories have}} been proposed regarding {{the economic impact of}} income taxes. Income taxes are <b>widely</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a progressive tax (the incidence of tax increases as income increases).|$|E
25|$|The Alliance for Progress {{achieved}} a short-lived public relations success. It also had real but limited economic advances. But {{by the early}} 1970s the program was <b>widely</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a failure.|$|E
25|$|At a {{strategic}} level, the outcome {{has been the}} subject of a huge amount of literature with no clear consensus. The battle was <b>widely</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> indecisive in the immediate aftermath and this view remains influential.|$|E
50|$|In 2008, {{the song}} Is {{it too much}} asking also from RAmez's second CD was played on Lebanon's Radio One and the {{controversial}} video in relation to that song is <b>widely</b> <b>viewed</b> on YouTube <b>as</b> a result.|$|R
5|$|The {{first of}} three 2012 presidential {{election}} debates took place on October 3, in Denver. Media figures and political analysts <b>widely</b> <b>viewed</b> Romney <b>as</b> having delivered a stronger and more focused presentation than did President Obama. That initial debate overshadowed Obama's improved presentation {{in the last two}} debates later in October, and Romney maintained a small advantage in the debates when seen as a whole.|$|R
50|$|By 1945 Blachut's {{performance}} credits {{had grown}} to include {{almost all of the}} major tenor parts from the Czech repertory. At this point he was <b>widely</b> <b>view</b> <b>as</b> Czechoslovakia's leading tenor and he appeared on tour with the Czech National Opera in opera performances in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Russia. He also appeared with the company in England at the 1964 Edinburgh Festival in an acclaimed portrayal of Luka Kuzmič in Janáček's From the House of the Dead. He returned to Edinburgh for another lauded performance in 1970 as Matěj Brouček in The Excursions of Mr. Brouček. That same year he sang in the world premiere of Jiří Pauer's Zdravý nemocný in Prague after Le malade imaginaire by Molière. Blachut was also highly regaurded internationally for his portrayal of the title role in Smetana's Dalibor.|$|R
25|$|After the disappointments of Dark Horse and Extra Texture over 1974–75, Thirty Three & ⅓ was <b>widely</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> {{a return}} to form for Harrison. The new album earned the artist his strongest reviews since All Things Must Pass (1970).|$|E
25|$|But {{all this}} was for naught. With far more demand for tickets than there were available, the team was financially healthy no matter how poorly it {{performed}} on the field, and the Maras were <b>widely</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> complacent by observers who didn't know {{the depth of the}} ownership schism.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, the United States Department of Defense {{adopted the}} use of Code 39 for marking all {{products}} sold to the United States military. This system, Logistics Applications of Automated Marking and Reading Symbols (LOGMARS), is still used by DoD and is <b>widely</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> the catalyst for widespread adoption of barcoding in industrial uses.|$|E
50|$|The Power Broker is <b>widely</b> <b>viewed</b> http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/news/666 <b>as</b> {{a seminal}} work because it {{combined}} painstaking historical research with a smoothly flowing narrative writing style. The {{success of this}} approach was evident in his chapter {{on the construction of}} the Cross-Bronx Expressway, where Caro reported the controversy from all perspectives, including that of neighborhood residents. The result was a work of powerful literary as well as academic interest. Upon its publication, Moses denounced the biography in a 23-page statement.|$|R
25|$|Civil courts {{exist for}} {{lawsuits}} and other disputes, {{but the public}} <b>widely</b> <b>viewed</b> them <b>as</b> corrupt. Magistrates were poorly paid, and the party willing to pay them the most money was generally believed to receive decisions in its favor. Most individuals could not afford the often prohibitive fees associated with filing a civil case. No civil court exists to address human rights violations. Military courts had effective jurisdiction over most human rights violations, since government security forces were the primary violators.|$|R
25|$|This {{extreme example}} does not, however, {{mean that the}} total death toll should be lowered by three million. Rather, the four million figure should be {{regarded}} as Soviet propaganda; following a correct distribution, the total death toll still amounts to conventionally held figures. The role played by The Destruction in shaping <b>widely</b> held <b>views</b> <b>as</b> to distribution of and evidence for these, has for decades been, and arguably remains, almost canonical in Holocaust historiography.|$|R
25|$|<b>Widely</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> {{the best}} cricket grounds in {{mainland}} Europe (excluding grounds in the Netherlands), the ground {{lies in the}} pictoresque setting just ten minutes from Luxembourg City center. It boasts a large outfield (with two tracks laid on different bases), four practise bays, a clubhouse with catering facilities, a cricket/tennis pavilion, and various other amenities.|$|E
25|$|Postwar {{social and}} {{political}} instability, fueled by economic uncertainty {{and the collapse of}} the Lebanese currency, led to the resignation of Prime Minister Omar Karami, also in May 1992, after less than 2 years in office. He was replaced by former Prime Minister Rachid Solh, who was <b>widely</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a caretaker to oversee Lebanon's first parliamentary elections in 20 years.|$|E
25|$|The EEC {{was unable}} to achieve a common policy during {{the first month of}} the War. It issued a {{statement}} on November 6, after the embargo and price rises had begun. It was <b>widely</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> pro-Arab supporting the Franco-British line on the war. OPEC duly lifted its embargo from all EEC members. The price rises had a much greater impact in Europe than the embargo.|$|E
50|$|Many {{parties have}} criticized the ICRP's {{adoption}} of the linear no-threshold model for exaggerating the effects of low radiation doses. The most frequently cited alternatives are the “linear quadratic” model and the “hormesis” model. The linear quadratic model is <b>widely</b> <b>viewed</b> in radiotherapy <b>as</b> the best model of cellular survival, {{and it is the}} best fit to leukemia data from the LSS cohort.|$|R
40|$|Research {{has found}} that women {{tend to have more}} {{negative}} predispositions towards studying economics than men, which contributes to their underrepresentation in the field. This paper uses survey data on principles students at a large state university to investigate causes of this difference. We find that students <b>widely</b> <b>view</b> economics <b>as</b> a business-oriented field that prioritizes math skills and making money — a combination that is a turnoff for women, but not so much men. Thus, emphasizing uses of economics for social welfare analysis, while de-emphasizing its business applications, may help to rebalance predispositions {{at the outset of the}} principles class. ...|$|R
30|$|This section {{establishes}} the equivalence on equity between price-guided and quantity-guided planning procedures, {{which is an}} extension of Laffont and Rochet (1985). Their nonlinear pricing scheme and the duality results on the conditions overtuned the <b>widely</b> held <b>view</b> <b>as</b> to the superiority of the quantity-guided procedures, particularly with public goods. Contrary to the conjecture in Malinvaud (1971) about the falsification of preferences, Laffont and Rochet (1985) proved the equivalence between price and quantity planning procedures. To tackle the equity issue, this paper adopts Kolm’s super-equity and transforms it into our dynamic context.|$|R
25|$|Oto-Manguean {{languages}} (also Otomanguean) are a {{large family}} comprising several subfamilies of indigenous languages of the Americas. All of the Oto-Manguean languages that are now spoken are indigenous to Mexico, but the Manguean branch of the family, which is now extinct, was spoken {{as far south as}} Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Oto-Manguean is <b>widely</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a proven language family. However, this status has been recently challenged (Brown 2015).|$|E
25|$|Hart {{sought the}} Democratic presidential {{nomination}} in 1984, narrowly losing {{the race to}} Vice President Walter Mondale. Hart declined to seek re-election to the Senate in 1986 and sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1988. He was <b>widely</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> the front-runner until reports surfaced of an extramarital affair, and Hart withdrew from the race in May 1987. He re-entered the race in December 1987 but withdrew from the race again after faring poorly in the early primaries.|$|E
25|$|Whilst David Cameron was prime minister, Osborne was <b>widely</b> <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> a {{potential}} future {{leader of the}} Conservatives were Cameron to stand down and trigger a leadership contest, despite being seen as a relatively unpopular figure with the general public. Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi suggested that the closeness {{of his relationship with}} Cameron meant the two effectively shared power in the 2010–16 government, whilst commentators pointed to Osborne's hand in Cabinet reshuffles. He worked hard on rebuilding his image after the much-criticised 2012 budget.|$|E
40|$|The {{sense of}} smell has <b>widely</b> been <b>viewed</b> <b>as</b> {{inferior}} to the other senses. This {{is reflected in the}} lack of treatment of olfaction in ethnographies and linguistic descriptions. We present novel data from the olfactory lexicon of Seri, a language isolate of Mexico, which sheds new light onto the possibilities for olfactory terminologies. We also present the Seri smellscape, highlighting the cultural significance of odors in Seri culture which, along with the olfactory language, is now under threat as globalization takes hold and traditional ways of life are transformed...|$|R
2500|$|The Brock Press, {{a student}} {{newspaper}} of Brock University in Ontario, Canada, {{writes that the}} novella “is short, but vast in its significance”, claiming that “the book continues to make strides in its telling of Wenjack’s story, pushing {{for the history of}} residential schools, the attempts to destroy First Nations cultures and forced assimiliation through violence and hate to be more <b>widely</b> <b>viewed</b> and discussed <b>as</b> a part of Canada’s history.” ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the list}} those idioms deemed by member states as mere dialects of an {{official}} language are not included. It {{should be noted that}} many of these alleged dialects are <b>widely</b> <b>viewed</b> by linguists <b>as</b> separate languages. These include Scots—the Germanic language descended from Old English, not the Celtic language known as Scots Gaelic—and several Romance languages spoken in Portugal and in Italy, such as Mirandese, Lombard, Ligurian, Piedmontese, Sardinian, Venetian, Corsican, Neapolitan, and Sicilian.|$|R
