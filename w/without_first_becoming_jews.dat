40|$|From {{the history}} of the Church, we gather {{that one of the most}} major tests that confronted the early Christian {{community}} was whether everyone who wanted to become a Christian also of necessity had to become a Jew as a pre-requisite for entrance into the new community of believers. The issue at stake is whether one qualifies to be a Christian through adherence to the Jewish identity, which centres on circumcision and the observance of the Mosaic legal code. The crisis resulted to the convocation of the Jerusalem Council (cf. Acts 15), which tasked itself with the definition of the Christian identity. The Council bases its definition of Christian identity, separable from adherence to the Jewish cultural practice (a form of cultural imperialism), solely on election by God in Jesus Christ. Moreover, the event of the Pentecost in Jerusalem demonstrated what the nature of the spreading of the message of this new community of believers in Jesus Christ should be: that people from other cultures, “Parthians, Medes and Elamites; people from Mesopotamia, Judaea and Capadocia, Ponthus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylis, Egypt and the parts of Libya around Cyrene; as well as visitors from Rome, Jews and Proselytes alike, Cretans and Arabs” (Acts 2 : 9 - 11), could understand the message that Peter communicated to them through the force of the breath of the risen Jesus in their own mother tongue, <b>without</b> <b>first</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>Jews.</b> Against the background of this crucial point in {{the history of}} the early Church and in consideration of the Second Vatican Council, this dissertation seeks to address the problem of identity, unity and diversity in the Christian religion with special reference to Africa. It proposes that the traditional African Rites of Initiation that mark the transition from one stage of life to the other and therefore the existential and essential transformation of the individual and group offer with their rich symbolisms a very fertile ground for dialogue with the Christian religion. It views the various Rites of Initiation (from birth and ritual circumcision over puberty and adult to marriage and funeral rites) as vital and immutable seminal points in the life of the individual African and his/her society at large. These Rites that express in various ways the African holistic view and conception of life and reality are, in terms of their religious symbolism, meaning and function, analogous to their Christian counterparts (such as baptism, confirmation, Eucharist, ordination, marriage) and can as a result be conveniently accepted or at least incorporated even if in modified forms as authentic African initiation rites for African Christians. Without being syncretistic, such an incorporation and modification at one and the same time recognizes and respects the cultural identity of the African and marks his/her transformation and acceptance of his/her new identity, modelled on Christ. In this way, the African Christian will be enabled to live, articulate and express his/her faith within his/her own historical-cultural milieu. On the whole, the presentation is predictive and prescriptive with regard to what the relationship and dialogue between Christianity and the African Traditional Religion should be or should not be. It is an honest effort to make the Christian message relevant to the African in his/her own perceptual and conceptual world-view. This task remains a steady challenge to African Christians who want to maintain at one and the same time and at the same level their African identity and their Christian calling. The balancing and reconciling of these two identities in a correlating rather than confrontational manner remains a task for the Church of today and tomorrow. The dissertation is a foundational contribution to building up and sharpening consciousness for this problem...|$|E

40|$|Aim: Occupational {{therapists}} facilitate {{participation in}} everyday life increasingly dominated by technology. Simple environmental control systems (ECS) facilitate engagement in occupations for people with severe physical impairment but many occupational therapists overlook this technology. This paper will encourage occupational therapists to pursue the use of ECS in clinical practice. Method: An interactive approach will enable attendees to relate their clinical experience to research that explored the lived experience of using ECS in four focus groups and six in-depth interviews. The research will be presented using verbatim transcriptions, video clips and examples of interpretative phenomenological analysis. Results: ECS users feel enabled and reclaim the capacity “to do”. Attendees will understand that these benefits are not possible <b>without</b> <b>first</b> <b>becoming</b> used to using ECS {{which can be a}} hassle but ultimately enjoyable. Conclusion: Occupational therapists will appreciate the viability and importance of ECS in clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Loss of terminally {{differentiated}} cardiomyocytes due {{to heart}} disease is irreversible and current therapeutic regimes are limited. Cell therapy using stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes is an attractive option to repair injured hearts. The discovery of direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs) and successful differentiation of iPSCs into cardiomyocytes provided a revolutionary paradigm in heart regenerative research. During the past decades, significant advances in stem cell culture, differentiation and purification protocols, as well as in cell transplantation methodologies, have been achieved. On the other hand, recent studies demonstrated that a somatic cell could be converted into an alternative differentiated cell type <b>without</b> <b>first</b> <b>becoming</b> a stem cell by overexpression of lineage-specific factors. We found that functional cardiomyocytes can be directly induced from fibroblasts by a combination of three cardiac transcription factors, Gata 4, Mef 2 c and Tbx 5, in vitro and in vivo. I will review the perspectives of heart regeneration using reprogramming technology...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{reprogramming}} of fibroblasts to induced pluripotent {{stem cells}} (iPSCs) raises the possibility that a somatic cell could be reprogrammed to an alternative differentiated fate <b>without</b> <b>first</b> <b>becoming</b> a stem/progenitor cell. A large pool of fibroblasts exists in the postnatal heart, yet no single “master regulator” of direct cardiac reprogramming has been identified. Here, we report that a combination of three developmental transcription factors (i. e., Gata 4, Mef 2 c, and Tbx 5) rapidly and efficiently reprogrammed postnatal cardiac or dermal fibroblasts directly into differentiated cardiomyocyte-like cells. Induced cardiomyocytes expressed cardiac-specific markers, had a global gene expression profile similar to cardiomyocytes, and contracted spontaneously. Fibroblasts transplanted into mouse hearts one day after transduction of the three factors also differentiated into cardiomyocyte-like cells. We believe these findings demonstrate that functional cardiomyocytes can be directly reprogrammed from differentiated somatic cells by defined factors. Reprogramming of endogenous or explanted fibroblasts might provide a source of cardiomyocytes for regenerative approaches. PaperCli...|$|R
50|$|One {{example of}} {{deposition}} {{is the process}} by which, in sub-freezing air, water vapor changes directly to ice <b>without</b> <b>first</b> <b>becoming</b> a liquid. This is how snow forms in clouds, {{as well as how}} frost and hoar frost form on the ground or other surfaces. Another example is when frost forms on a leaf. For deposition to occur, thermal energy must be removed from a gas. When the leaf becomes cold enough, water vapor in the air surrounding the leaf loses enough thermal energy to change into a solid. Even though the air temperature may be below the dew point, the water vapor {{may not be able to}} condense spontaneously if there is no way to remove the latent heat. When the leaf is introduced, the supercooled water vapor immediately begins to condense, but by this point is already past the freezing point. This causes the water vapor to change directly into a solid.|$|R
40|$|TAME is a {{special-purpose}} interface to PVS {{designed to}} support developers of software systems in proving properties of automata models.

40|$|In vitro, {{dendritic}} cells (DCs) bind {{and transfer}} intact, infectious HIV to CD 4 T cells <b>without</b> <b>first</b> <b>becoming</b> infected, {{a process known}} as trans-infection. trans-infection is accomplished by recruitment of HIV and its receptors to the site of DC–T cell contact and transfer of virions at a structure known as the infectious synapse. In this study, we used fluorescent microscopy to track individual HIV particles trafficking in DCs during virus uptake and trans-infection. Mature DCs rapidly concentrated HIV into an apparently intracellular compartment that lacked markers characteristic of early endosomes, lysosomes, or antigen-processing vesicles. Live cell microscopy demonstrated that the HIV-containing compartment was rapidly polarized toward the infectious synapse after contact with a T cell; however, the bulk of the concentrated virus remained in the DCs after T cell engagement. Individual virions were observed emerging from the compartment and fusing with the T cell membrane at the infectious synapse. The compartmentalized HIV, although engulfed by the cytoplasm, was fully accessible to HIV envelope-specific inhibitors and other membrane-impermeable probes that were delivered to the cell surface. These results demonstrate that HIV resides in an invaginated domain within DCs that is both contiguous with the plasma membrane and distinct from endocytic vesicles. We conclude that HIV virions are routed through this specialize...|$|R

40|$|Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} is {{a leading}} killer of HIV-infected individuals worldwide, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where it is responsible for up to 50 % of HIV-related deaths. Infection by HIV predisposes individuals to M. tuberculosis infection, and coinfection accelerates the progression of both diseases. In contrast to most other opportunistic infections associated with HIV, {{an increased risk of}} M. tuberculosis infection occurs during early-stage HIV disease, long before CD 4 T cell counts fall below critical levels. We hypothesized that M. tuberculosis infection contributes to HIV pathogenesis by interfering with dendritic cell (DC) -mediated immune control. DCs carry pathogens like M. tuberculosis and HIV from sites of infection into lymphoid tissues, where they process and present antigenic peptides to CD 4 T cells. Paradoxically, DCs can also deliver infectious HIV to T cells <b>without</b> <b>first</b> <b>becoming</b> infected, a process known as trans-infection. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -activated DCs sequester HIV in pocketlike membrane invaginations that remain open to the cell surface, and individual virions are delivered from the pocket into T cells at the site of contact during trans-infection. Here we report that M. tuberculosis exposure increases HIV trans-infection and induces viral sequestration within surface-accessible compartments identical to those seen in LPS-stimulated DCs. At the same time, M. tuberculosis dramatically decreases the degradative processing and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) presentation of HIV antigens to CD 4 T cells. Our data suggest that M. tuberculosis infection promotes a shift in the dynamic balance between antigen processing and intact virion presentation, favoring DC-mediated amplification of HIV infections...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} a specialized interface to PVS called TAME (Timed Automata Modeling Environment) which provides automated support for proving properties of I/O automata. A major goal of TAME {{is to allow}} a software developer to use PVS to specify and prove properties of an I/O automaton efficiently and <b>without</b> <b>first</b> <b>becoming</b> a PVS expert. To accomplish this goal, TAME provides a template that the user completes to specify an I/O automaton {{and a set of}} proof steps natural for humans to use for proving properties of automata. Each proof step is implemented by a PVS strategy and possibly some auxiliary theories that support that strategy. We have used the results of two recent formal methods studies as a basis for two case studies to evaluate TAME. In the first formal methods study, Romijn used I/O automata to specify and verify memory and remote procedure call components of a concurrent system. In the second formal methods study, Devillers et al. specified a tree identify protocol (TIP), part of the IEEE 1394 bus protocol, and provided hand proofs of TIP properties. Devillers also used PVS to specify TIP and to check proofs of TIP properties. In our first case study, the third author, a new TAME user with no previous PVS experience, used TAME to create PVS specifications of the I/O automata formulated by Romijn and Devillers et al. and to check their hand proofs. In our second case study, the TAME approach to verification was compared with an alternate approach by Devillers which uses PVS directly...|$|R
40|$|The {{reproduction}} of spindle poles {{is a key}} event in the cell's preparation for mitosis. To gain further insight into how this process is controlled, we systematically characterized the ultrastructure of spindle poles whose reproductive capacity had been experimentally altered. In particular, we wanted {{to determine if the}} ability of a pole to reproduce before the next division is related to the number of centrioles it contains. We used mercaptoethanol to indirectly induce the formation of monopolar spindles in sea urchin eggs. We followed individually treated eggs in vivo with a polarizing microscope during the induction and development of monopolar spindles. We then fixed each egg at one of three predetermined key stages and serially semithick sectioned it for observation in a high-voltage electron microscope. We thus know the history of each egg before fixation and, from earlier studies, what that cell would have done had it not been fixed. We found that spindle poles that would have given rise to monopolar spindles at the next mitosis have only one centriole whereas spindle poles that would have formed bipolar spindles at the next division have two centrioles. By serially sectioning each egg, we were able to count all centrioles present. In the twelve cells examined, we found no cases of acentriolar spindle poles or centriole reduplication. Thus, the reproductive capacity of a spindle pole is linked to the number of centrioles it contains. Our experimental results also show, contrary to existing reports, that the daughter centriole of a centrosome can acquire pericentriolar material <b>without</b> <b>first</b> <b>becoming</b> a parent. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the splitting apart of mother and daughter centrioles is an event that is distinct from, and not dependent on, centriole duplication...|$|R
