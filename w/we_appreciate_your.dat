Astral would try again and announced a new planned purchase of CHHR on December 19, 2011, with a purchase price of $13.4 million. [...] Astral's purchase was completed in February 2012.

5000|$|Prior to filming, several {{businesses}} in the area, including the bars Skinner's Loft, Barcade and LITM, denied filming permits to MTV, which The Jersey Journal reported was due to their {{the need to make}} their regular customers a priority.

The Beechwood Cafe and Market, across the street from the firehouse, also indicated they would not let the two in their restaurant. Tia's Place, a trendy clothing store on Grove Street, also declined filming because that store's contract prohibits it. The week Polizzi and Farley moved into their home, Newark, New Jersey Mayor Cory Booker denied filming permits to the production company, stating in a letter printed by the Newark Star-Ledger, [...] "While <b>we</b> <b>appreciate</b> <b>your</b> desire to film and capture the essence of our great city, we are confident that the filming of this show will most certainly attract a high level of local and national attention and notoriety." [...] Booker explained his decision by saying that he did not wish the city's emergency personnel to devote its time to handling incidents involving the reality stars. Other businesses, however, were more welcoming to the production, including O'Connell's Bar & Grill on Montgomery Street, Walker's Apothecary, a spa and nail salon near the apartment, and Bar Majestic on Grove Street.|$|E

While this is a sign of the current climate that we find ourselves in with Star Trek fan films, I want to personally thank CBS for reaching out to me, rather than including us in their ongoing lawsuit against Axanar.It was conveyed that the reason CBS was reaching out to me was due to the legal troubles stemming from the Axanar case. Again, CBS did not have to reach out personally.
