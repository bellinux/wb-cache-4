40|$|This Article, a {{contribution}} to a symposium on constitutional foundations, maintains that an unappreciated function of stare decisis is that of referee between competing visions of the Constitution. Stare decisis is styled as a doctrine of error-correction, but in controversial cases, 2 ̆ 2 error 2 ̆ 2 is often a stand-in for disagreement about first principles. In these cases, stare decisis functions less to guide the business of correcting mistakes — a conception that oversimplifies the reality of pluralism on the Court — than to mediate intense disputes about the Court’s role in interpreting the Constitution. Identifying this function of stare decisis offers a different perspective on the values served by the Court’s traditionally <b>weak</b> <b>presumption</b> against overruling constitutional precedent. Insofar as it avoids entrenching particular resolutions to methodological controversies, weak stare decisis reflects respect for pluralism {{on and off the}} Court, as well as realism about the likelihood that justices will lightly let go of their deeply held interpretive commitments. At the same time, the <b>weak</b> <b>presumption</b> does not abandon all constraint: placing the burden of justification on justices who would overrule disciplines jurisprudential disagreement lest it become too disruptive. While the ability to overrule comes at some cost to continuity, stare decisis is ill-suited to accomplish much more than this tempering function in the face of continuing disagreement about what the Constitution requires...|$|E
40|$|We propose and {{experimentally}} validate a first-principles based {{model for}} the nonlinear piezoelectric response of an electroelastic energy harvester. The analysis herein {{highlights the importance of}} modeling inherent piezoelectric nonlinearities that are not limited to higher order elastic effects but also include nonlinear coupling to a power harvesting circuit. Furthermore, a nonlinear damping mechanism is shown to accurately restrict the amplitude and bandwidth of the frequency response. The linear piezoelectric modeling framework widely accepted for theoretical investigations is demonstrated to be a <b>weak</b> <b>presumption</b> for near-resonant excitation amplitudes as low as 0. 5 g in a prefabricated bimorph whose oscillation amplitudes remain geometrically linear for the full range of experimental tests performed (never exceeding 0. 25 % of the cantilever overhang length). Nonlinear coefficients are identified via a nonlinear least-squares optimization algorithm that utilizes an approximate analytic solution obtained by the method of harmonic balance. For lead zirconate titanate (PZT- 5 H), we obtained a fourth order elastic tensor component of c 1111 p =- 3. 6673 × 1017 N/m 2 and a fourth order electroelastic tensor value of e 3111 = 1. 7212 × 108 m/V. © 2010 American Institute of Physics...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Reverse {{engineering}} {{is a process}} highly influenced by assumptions and hypothesises of a reverse engineer, who has to analyse a system manually, be-cause tools are often not applicable to large systems with many different imple-mentation styles. Successful tools must support an interactive process, where the engineer is able to steer the analysis process by proving certain assumptions and hypothesises. Consequently, the input format of the analysis tool must support a kind of impreciseness to formulate <b>weak</b> <b>presumptions.</b> In this paper we present a reverse engineering process based on fuzzified graph transformation rules. We use layered graph grammars in addition with fuzzy logic to detect design patterns in Java source code. Impreciseness is expressed by assigning fuzzy values to graph transformation rules and thresholds are used to lookup only firmed occur-rences of patterns. Underlying the transformation rules is an object-oriented graph model providing composition and inheritance, which reduces the complex-ity of the rules. We propose a reverse engineering process starting with imprecise rules and refining and specifying the rules during the analysis. Preliminary results applying our process are promising, i. e., we present the results of detecting design patterns in Java’s abstract window toolkit library. ...|$|R
