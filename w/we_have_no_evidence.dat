At what epoch of the world's history this took place, again, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> whatever. It may have been in the older tertiary, or earlier, but what is most important to remember is, that the discoveries of late years have proved that man inhabited Western Europe, at any rate, before the occurrence of those great physical changes which have given Europe its present aspect.

6000|$|In {{an earlier}} work by Dr. Munro, Prehistoric Scotland (p. 439), {{published}} in 1899, he observes that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> {{as to the}} when, or how of {{the removal of the}} stones of the hypothetical [...] "Corporation cairn," [...] or [...] "round tower with very thick walls," [...] {46b} or [...] "watch tower," [...] which is supposed to have been erected above the wooden sub-structure at Dumbuck. He tentatively suggests that the stones may have been used, perhaps, for the stone causeway now laid along the bank of the recently made canal, from a point close to the crannog to the railway. No record is cited. He now offers guesses as to the stones [...] "in the so-called pavements and causeways." [...] First, the causeways may have probably been made [...] "during the construction of the tower with its central pole," [...] (here the cairn is a habitable beacon, habitable on all hypotheses,) or, again, [...] "perhaps {{at the time of its}} demolition" [...] about which demolition we know nothing, {47a} except that the most of the stones are not now in situ.|$|E
60|$|The lowest form of {{language}} is the exclamation, by which an entire idea is vaguely conveyed through a single sound; {{as among the}} lower animals. That human language ever consisted solely of exclamations, and so was strictly homogeneous in respect of its parts of speech, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence.</b> But that language can be traced down to a form in which nouns and verbs are its only elements, is an established fact. In the gradual multiplication of parts of speech out of these primary ones--in the differentiation of verbs into active and passive, of nouns into abstract and concrete--in the rise of distinctions of mood, tense, person, of number and case--in the formation of auxiliary verbs, of adjectives, adverbs, pronouns, prepositions, articles--in the divergence of those orders, genera, species, and varieties of parts of speech by which civilised races express minute modifications of meaning--we see a change from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous. And it may be remarked, in passing, {{that it is more}} especially in virtue of having carried this subdivision of function to a greater extent and completeness, that the English language is superior to all others.|$|E
60|$|I am, however, unwilling without {{distinct}} {{evidence to}} admit that two complex processes of selection, each requiring the transference of new characters to one sex alone, have been carried on with a multitude of species,--that the males have been rendered more brilliant by beating their rivals, and the females more dull-coloured by having escaped from their enemies. The male, for instance, of the common brimstone butterfly (Gonepteryx), is of a far more intense yellow than the female, though she is equally conspicuous; {{and it does not}} seem probable that she specially acquired her pale tints as a protection, though it is probable that the male acquired his bright colours as a sexual attraction. The female of Anthocharis cardamines does not possess the beautiful orange wing-tips of the male; consequently she closely resembles the white butterflies (Pieris) so common in our gardens; but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> that this resemblance is beneficial to her. As, on the other hand, she resembles both sexes of several other species of the genus inhabiting various quarters of the world, it is probable that she has simply retained to a large extent her primordial colours.|$|E
50|$|While <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> direct <b>evidence</b> for that, it {{is highly}} likely that legal {{proceedings}} only started {{if there was a}} plaintiff, either the injured party or a representative, the latter almost certainly a kinsmen of the injured party. Proceedings probably will have been started by a complaint to whoever was seen responsible to uphold justice, which might have been a druid, in some late Gaulish policies an official, or perhaps a noble patron of either the injured party or the offender, or possibly the offender himself had to be approached. It is most likely that if the offender did not submit willingly to settle the dispute in court, he could be distrained by the plaintiff. While <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> direct <b>evidence</b> for the latter, it seems quite likely, given that the practice is well attested in early medieval Irish and Welsh law with cognate terminology, but also in the early Germanic laws, and even in early Roman law.|$|R

60|$|Order, Coleoptera (Beetles).—Many beetles are {{coloured}} so as {{to resemble}} the surfaces which they habitually frequent. Other species are ornamented with gorgeous metallic tints,—for instance, many Carabidæ, which live {{on the ground and}} have the power of defending themselves by an intensely acrid secretion,—the splendid diamond-beetles which are protected by an extremely hard covering,—many species of Chrysomela, such as C. cerealis, a large species beautifully striped with various colours, and in Britain confined to the bare summit of Snowdon,—and a host of other species. These splendid colours, which are often arranged in stripes, spots, crosses and other elegant patterns, can hardly be beneficial, as a protection, except in the case of some flower-feeding species; and we cannot believe that they are purposeless. Hence the suspicion arises, that they serve as a sexual attraction; but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> on this head, for the sexes rarely differ in colour. Blind beetles, which cannot of course behold each other’s beauty, never exhibit, as I hear from Mr. Waterhouse, jun., bright colours, though they often have polished coats: but the explanation of their obscurity may be that blind insects inhabit caves and other obscure stations.|$|E
60|$|It is {{impossible}} to prove, historically, {{which of the two}} main elements in belief--the idea of an Eternal Being or Beings, or the idea of surviving ghosts--came first into the minds of men. The idea of primeval Eternal Beings, as understood by savages, does not depend on, or require, the ghost theory. But, as we almost always find ghosts and a Supreme Being together, where we find either, among the lowest savages, we have no historical ground for asserting that either is prior to the other. Where <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> to the belief in the Maker, we must not conclude that no such belief exists. Our knowledge is confused and scanty; often it is derived from men who do not know the native language, or the native sacred language, or have not been trusted with what the savage treasures as his secret. Moreover, if anywhere ghosts are found without gods, it is an inference from the argument that an idea familiar to very low savage tribes, like the Australians, and falling more and more into the background elsewhere, though still extant and traceable, might, in certain cases, be lost and forgotten altogether.|$|E
60|$|Many beetles are {{coloured}} so as {{to resemble}} the surfaces which they habitually frequent, and they thus escape detection by their enemies. Other species, for instance diamond-beetles, are ornamented with splendid colours, which are often arranged in stripes, spots, crosses, and other elegant patterns. Such colours can hardly serve directly as a protection, except {{in the case of}} certain flower-feeding species; but they may serve as a warning or means of recognition, on the same principle as the phosphorescence of the glow-worm. As with beetles the colours of the two sexes are generally alike, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> that they have been gained through sexual selection; but this is at least possible, for they have been developed in one sex and then transferred to the other; and this view is even in some degree probable in those groups which possess other well- marked secondary sexual characters. Blind beetles, which cannot of course behold each other's beauty, never, as I hear from Mr. Waterhouse, jun., exhibit bright colours, though they often have polished coats; but the explanation of their obscurity may be that they generally inhabit caves and other obscure stations.|$|E
