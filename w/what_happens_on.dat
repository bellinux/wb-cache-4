25|$|Festa Junina was {{introduced}} to Northeastern Brazil by the Portuguese for whom St John's day (also celebrated as Midsummer Day in several European countries), on June 24, {{is one of the}} oldest and most popular celebrations of the year. Differently from <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>on</b> the European Midsummer Day, the festivities in Brazil do not take place during the summer solstice but during the tropical winter solstice. The festivities traditionally begin after June 12, on the eve of St Anthony's day, and last until the 29th, which is Saint Peter's day. During these fifteen days, there are bonfires, fireworks, and folk dancing in the streets (step names are in French, which shows the mutual influences between court life and peasant culture in the 17th, 18th, and 19th-century Europe). Typical refreshments and dishes are served. It should be noted that, like during Carnival, these festivities involve costumes-wearing (in this case, peasant costumes), dancing, heavy drinking, and visual spectacles (fireworks display and folk dancing). Like <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>on</b> Midsummer and St John's Day in Europe, bonfires are a central part of these festivities in Brazil.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira {{revealed}} {{his intention to}} stay at the club, despite interest from Chelsea, who had been acquired by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich in the summer. Manager Arsène Wenger used his press conference to look ahead to the new season and felt his team's chances were as good, if not better than Chelsea's: [...] "I can understand that we look a little bit poor and out of shape but what is important is <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>on</b> the pitch and you will see that we look good. To write us off just because we haven't spent £100million is a bit easy." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Bennett, in 1994, {{discussed}} the poem's effectiveness: [...] "What {{is important and}} compelling in this poem {{is not so much}} <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>on</b> the urn or in the poem, but the way that a response to an artwork both figures and prefigures its own critical response". In 1999, Andrew Motion claimed that the poem [...] "tells a story that cannot be developed. Celebrating the transcendent powers of art, it creates a sense of imminence, but also registers a feeling of frustration." [...] Ayumi Mizukoshi, in 2001, argued that early audiences did not support [...] "Ode to Psyche" [...] because it [...] "turned out to be too reflexive and internalised to be enjoyed as a mythological picture. For the same reason, the 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' drew neither attention nor admiration. Although the poet is gazing round the surface of the urn in each stanza, the poem cannot readily be consumed as a series of 'idylls'." ...|$|E
500|$|Early breaker Denifl {{was alone}} in front and had about two minutes of an {{advantage}} with [...] to go. Behind, Domenico Pozzovivo placed an acceleration that put the lead group in difficulty, but he was brought back. The time gap rapidly decreased, due to dubious time monitoring again. Pinot launched an attack from the group, but Špilak had the resources {{to keep up with}} him for a while but was ultimately dropped. Pinot passed the passive Denifl before the arch signaling the last kilometer (flamme rouge) and took a solo victory. Pozzovivo finished second while Špilak settled for third. However, it became soon apparent that Dumoulin would not lose much more than the minute and a half that was his objective. He passed the line 1' 37" [...] down on Pinot. [...] "I'm very happy, it was important for me and the team. We came here to win a stage, and I had good legs today. I've got a lot of confidence now, that’s important for the Tour de France.

[...] "The objective is to win overall here, but the rouleurs like [...] Thomas and [...] Dumoulin aren't far back," [...] he added. [...] "It'll be a long and difficult time trial [...] We'll see <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>on</b> the day." ...|$|E

500|$|Alex Rees from Cosmopolitan {{felt that}} the video {{contained}} [...] "uncomfortable footage", but added that the [...] "emotionally unsettling" [...] images were able {{to reflect on the}} actual reality of <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>on</b> college campuses. Claire Hodgson from the same publication described the clip as a [...] "beautifully shot, brilliantly acted short film", which [...] "really does not hold back when it comes to portraying the real horror of sexual assault in the most graphic way possible". Emily Shire from The Daily Beast was positive about the clip, calling it: [...] "both chilling and beautiful. The overall effect is as much, if not more, a credit to acclaimed director Catherine Hardwicke. The brutality of these snapshot scenes are remarkably moving in the scariest and most sickening way possible". However, Shire was disappointed with one aspect of the PSA – that the victims are supported by their friends and close-ones and that was enough to cope through the trauma. Instead Shire wanted to see the legal ramifications of such traumatic incidents, with the victims going to the police. Shire concluded the review saying: [...] "Gaga and Hardwicke deserve props for creating such a powerful, visceral, and aesthetically striking PSA. They've brought a tremendous amount of attention to rape and sexual assault. Yet, attention alone is inadequate balm for the victims of rape." [...] Conversely, Dan Solomon of Fast Company believed the video to be an [...] "important statement" [...] from Gaga and believed that it would direct further attention to The Hunting Ground.|$|E
500|$|... "Lose Yourself" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by most television critics. James Poniewozik of Time has mixed {{reactions to the}} episode. He was critical of the plot arc between Grey and Chase, [...] harshly criticizing Grey's acting and expressing that [...] " [...] didn't think that Adrian Grenier had completely sold Vince’s downward spiral." [...] He continued: [...] "There’s something half-jokey about his manner that makes me think he’s about to break up laughing, as in a blooper reel." [...] In contrast, Poniewozik felt that [...] "for {{the first time in}} a while, I’m really interested to see <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>on</b> Entourage next." [...] Dan Philips of IGN gave the episode a nine out of ten, signifying an [...] "amazing" [...] rating. Philips praised [...] "Lose Yourself", opining that it was an [...] "excellent, extremely entertaining climax to this season's two main plot lines." [...] He added, [...] "Even though the episode never got around to providing any resolution, the overall journey was engaging enough to make its cliffhanger feel less like a cheap trick to get us to tune in for season eight." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by Josh Wagler of MTV, who praised Grenier's performance, opining that it was his best performance to date. The A.V. Club writer Kyle Ryan gave the episode a 'B-' grade. Ryan wrote, [...] "The last episode teed up tonight’s many confrontations [...] For a show that has specialized in spinning its wheels, these were surprisingly high stakes." [...] He was critical with the development of Vincent Chase, as well as his storyline with Sasha Grey, commenting that [...] "Vincent and his coterie just aren’t that interesting." ...|$|E

Victor Ponta quickly reacted to these statements by drawing up a penal complaint against President Traian Băsescu. In this complaint, the President is accused of blackmail and threat. European Socialist leader Sergey Stanishev condemned the statements made by Traian Băsescu, claiming that declarations to Gabriela Firea are provocative and inflammatory, and the suggestion that her husband could [...] "disappear" [...] is beyond the limits of decency.|$|E

2500|$|Conversion (or convert) : After a touchdown, {{the team}} that scored gets one {{scrimmage}} play to attempt to add {{one or two more}} points. If they make what would normally be a field goal, they score one point (a [...] "point-after"); what would normally be a touchdown scores two points (a [...] "two-point conversion"). In amateur games, this scrimmage is taken at the opponents' 5-yard line. The CFL formerly ran all conversion attempts from the 5-yard line as well, but starting in 2015 the line of scrimmage for one-point kick attempts became the 25-yard line, while two-point attempts are scrimmaged at the 3-yard line. No matter <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>on</b> the convert attempt, play then continues with a kickoff (see below).|$|E
2500|$|Brodsky’s third book, The Inside Story, {{began as}} an off-hand comment from a friend. Brodsky asked if her friend would like Brodsky to mail some letters for her, and the friend responded, [...] "they'll be very happy." [...] This led Brodsky to imagine happy letters, excited to go where they are going. Rebecca Rule writes in her review {{that it is a}} story [...] "about <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>on</b> those {{occasions}} (rare these days, it seems) when one writes and mails a personal letter, told {{from the point of view}} of an envelope." [...] This gave Brodsky an opportunity to broach the idea of change and how children can best understand and cope with it. Brodsky explains: [...] "Even though the story is an adventure about recycling and the mail system, I think the main theme is about change. Change is difficult for all of us. Kids often deal with change -- in school, in their families, in their neighborhoods." [...] For its discussion of recycling, the book received a national citation from the Green Book Festival in San Francisco.|$|E

2500|$|Mexican Federal Highway 101, {{which extends}} from the border city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas, to {{the capital of the}} state, Ciudad Victoria, is known by local {{residents}} as the [...] "Highway of Death." [...] Those who traveled through this highway in 2010 and 2011 used to see [...] "burned vehicles, bullet-shot trucks {{on the side of the}} road, and dead bodies, often decapitated, that the cartels would leave behind." [...] Others who have traveled through this highway and have survived car hijackings and checkpoints the organized crime groups have installed from Padilla to San Fernando have reported <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>on</b> the highway. A man who managed to survive a hijacking relates what he saw: [...] The violence and constant car hijackings have been so bad that bus lines avoid Mexican Federal Highway 101 by driving miles out of their way to avoid the road. Another report from a woman who survived a hijacking said through El Universal newspaper that heavily armed men would stop buses at roadblocks, and then force women and young girls at gunpoint, [...] "strip them naked, rape them," [...] and then drive away in trucks, leaving the passengers traumatized. One bus driver, [...] "who said he had avoided being stopped thus far," [...] claimed that another bus driver at the station had said that 12 people were pulled off the bus just 30 minutes before him. Other witnesses claim that once the buses were stopped, gunmen would storm the bus and point at certain passengers and say [...] "you, you're coming down," [...] and take them at gunpoint. The buses were then ordered to leave. Diamond, a study-abroad student, recalled the incident after having recovered from the brutal attack.|$|E

60|$|Still {{another form}} of high {{usefulness}} comes to our Corps, I should finally mention, in its opportunities for tracing the whereabouts and recovering {{the identity of the}} dead, the English dead, named in those grim lists, supplied to them by the military authorities, which their intercourse with the people in a given area where fighting has occurred enables them often blessedly to clear up. Their pervasiveness, their ubiquity, keeps them in touch with the people, witnesses of <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>on</b> the battle-swept area when, after the storm has moved on, certain of the lifeless sweepings are gathered up. Old villagers, searched out and questioned, testify and give a clue through which the whereabouts of the committal to thin earth of the last mortality of this, that, or the other of the obscurely fallen comes as a kind of irony of relief to those waiting in suspense. This uncertainty had attached itself for weeks to the fate in particular of many of the men concerned in the already so historic retreat of the Allies from Mons--ground still considerably {{in the hands of the}} Germans, but also gradually accessible and where, as quickly as it becomes so, Colonel Barry pushes out into it in search of information. Sternly touching are such notes of general indication, information from the Curé, the village carpenter, the grave-digger of the place, a man called so-and-so and a gentleman called something else, as to the burial of forty-five dead English in the public cemetery of such and such a small locality, as to the interment somewhere else of 'an Englishman believed to be an officer,' as to a hundred English surprised in a certain church and killed all but forty, and buried, as is not always their fortune for their kindred, without removal of their discs of identification. Among such like data we move when not among those of a more immediate violence, and all to be in their way scarce less considerately handled. Mixed with such gleanings one comes upon other matters of testimony of which one hopes equal note is made--testimony as to ferocities perpetrated upon the civil population which I may not here specify. Every form of assistance and inquiry takes place of course in conditions of some danger, thanks to the risk of stray bullets and shells, not infrequently met when cars operate, as they neither avoid doing nor wastefully seek to do, in proximity to the lines. The Germans, moreover, are noted as taking the view that the insignia of the Red Cross, with the implication of the precarious freight it covers, are in all circumstances a good mark for their shots; a view characteristic of their belligerent system at large, but not more deterrent for the ministers of the adversary in this connection than in any other, when the admirable end is in question.|$|E
