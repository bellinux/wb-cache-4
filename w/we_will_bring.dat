When asked during a March 1978 press conference {{about what it would}} be like to reprise the role, Shatner said, [...] "An actor brings to a role not only the concept of a character but his own basic personality, things that he is, and both Leonard Nimoy and myself have changed over the years, to a degree at any rate, and <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> that degree of change inadvertently to the role we recreate." ...|$|E

The church contained an altar board and preaching chair from the 16th century. All this {{was said to be}} of historical, Christian value. So it was to be reduced to a pile of ashes. The material damages are set to be of 13 million Norwegian Kroners. The church was still being used by a large flock of blind followers. It became a victim for true Norwegian spirit on the 13th of September Anno 1992 during a stormy night.

2500|$|Soon {{after these}} charges were filed, there were calls from gay rights advocates and bloggers to include hate crimes charges against Ravi and Wei.

[...] On October 4, 2010, Kaplan stated that he did not think there would be enough evidence to charge Ravi and Wei with a hate crime. After further investigation, the prosecution concluded that there was evidence supporting a hate crime charge against Ravi, dating to when Ravi first learned Clementi's name. On April 20, 2011, a Middlesex County grand jury indicted Ravi on 15 counts, including bias intimidation, invasion of privacy, witness tampering, and evidence tampering.|$|E

2500|$|Primary {{reasons for}} Turkey's {{persistent}} requests {{to join the}} EU are, among others, the many Turks in Europe {{and the importance of}} trade between the two. Turkey is, however, also increasingly disappointed with the widespread opposition to its accession among EU member states. In September 2012, Turkish Prime Minister Erdoğan was asked by CNN if Turkey still wants to join the EU. His response: [...] "There are 5 million Turks in Europe and 3 million Turks in Germany alone. We are a natural member of the European Union. Germany invited Turkish workers 50 years ago, however 50 years have passed and we have waited at the European Union's doorstep. No other country has experienced such a thing. We will be patient until a point. However, when we cross that point, <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> light to the situation and decide accordingly." [...] During a trip to Yalta, Erdoğan expressed his stern disappointment regarding the EU accession process: [...] "We are still an EU negotiating candidate. At such a position, I wish EU accession.

An early demo of the game was available for consumers {{to play at the}} event, and the game's title was changed from [...] "Grim Eclipse" [...] to [...] "Grimm Eclipse" [...] to match the spelling of the creatures in the show. Rooster Teeth CEO Matt Hullum stated, [...] "RWBY is a natural choice for us to focus on for our first in-house produced video game.

[...] On December 1, 2015 the game was released as an Early Access title on Steam, with the full PC release on July 5, 2016. The game was released for Mac OS X on October 13, 2016, and was later released for Xbox One and PlayStation 4 on January 17, 2017. The game allows one to four of the main characters in any combination(s) to battle through waves of Grimm. They are also on the trail of a mysterious company and its founder. The action takes place in the Emerald Forest, Mountain Glenn, Forever Fall and ultimately to an island named after the antagonist, Doctor Merlot.|$|E
2500|$|On July 11, 2007 at the E3 conference, it was {{revealed}} that Gears of War would indeed be released for Windows. New features include three new multi-player maps, an extension of five new single-player chapters to act five which describes events of Delta Squad escaping a giant Brumak between acts four and five (which Mark Rein claims is [...] "about 20 percent extra" [...] over the existing Xbox 360 content), new game modes, a game editor, and Games for Windows – Live support integrated into Unreal Engine 3. When asked about bringing the additional content to the Xbox 360 version, Mark Rein of Epic Games stated that [...] "it is unlikely <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>bring</b> that content to 360". He then states, [...] "Unfortunately the version it's built on is not really compatible with the 360 and so it would involve a massive patch, a patch larger than all five we've done so far, to Gears of War to do that." [...] Additionally, the PC and Xbox 360 versions will not allow for cross-platform play; Cliff Bleszinski stated that [...] "while this feature does add value, it just wasn't that desired nor worth the extra months of design and development time. We want Gears of War to be out this holiday on PC." [...] This news angered many owners of Gears of War on the Xbox 360 due to the game no longer living up to its [...] "Exclusively for the Xbox 360" [...] title and not receiving the additional content. Mark Rein noted that despite their original label of the game as an Xbox 360 exclusive, Microsoft allowed them to develop the game as part of the Games for Windows moniker, as has been done previously with Halo 2.|$|E
