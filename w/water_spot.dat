The method of photography creating Still Life covers three stages: exploration, planning, and realization. The result shows that firstly, the beauty of the photograph Still Life with the object of <b>water</b> <b>spot</b> can be caught and seen by eyes with high speed technique. Secondly, the image of water movement that is freezed can produces visual element and aesthetic effect by adding the light of lamp in the background at the time the photograph is taken.

From a randomly assembled group of 42 children aged between 5 and 8 years, residing in a community with non-fluoridated <b>water,</b> <b>spot</b> urinary samples were taken before the topical application of dental fluoride varnish and 2 hours afterwards. In an age-matched control group of 16 children from the same community, who received no treatment, samples were taken the same way. The urinary excretion of fluoride was analysed by determining fluoride ion (F-) level and fluoride/creatinine (F/Cr) ratio in the urine. In the study group, the average pre- and post-treatment F/Cr ratios were 0. 42 and 1. 38 mg/g, respectively (p <. 001). No significant changes were observed in the control group, which received no treatment. The average 2 hours afterward F/Cr ratios were 0. 29 and 0. 27 respectively (p = 0. 426).
