40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Ocean <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> shows great {{potential}} as a developing form of renewable energy. However, challenges arise in maturing this technology to achieve cost-effective energy conversion. Development and testing of <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters</b> can be problematic due to the harsh {{environment in which they}} are operated. To promote development of this technology, a platform is needed for comprehensive testing of these devices in this harsh environment. This will allow the determination of optimal topologies and control of <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters</b> for maximum power extraction. This work evaluates maximum power point tracking control in <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters</b> and presents two-variable maximum power point tracking control algorithms. A robust testing platform is developed for evaluating <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters</b> in the ocean environment.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 With the {{ever-increasing}} {{demand and}} competition for global energy resources among nations, {{it is essential}} to explore and tap into various energy sources to reduce dependency on global markets. Renewable energy sources offer a significant opportunity to create localized and stable <b>energy</b> supplies. Ocean <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> can be a promising contributor to the renewable generation portfolio for coastal communities. Developing economically feasible <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters</b> requires thorough analysis and testing of a scaled version of these devices in test tanks prior to full scale implementation. This work presents the design, construction, and performance of a small-scale active mooring system that can be programmed to emulate common mooring configurations for <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters.</b> This allows for a flexible, accurate, and cost-effective system to test mooring designs and their effects on overall performance and behavior of the <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters.</b> The second half of this research models and analyzes the effect of adding energy storage capacity to the <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters</b> and its impact on bus voltage and output power stability. Results show that incorporating ultra-capacitors as an energy storage solution can greatly improve performance and efficiency of the overall system...|$|R

Full details of this licence are available at: [URL] development of new <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters</b> has shed light {{on a number of}} unanswered questions in fluid mechanics, but has also identified a number of new issues of importance for their future deployment. The main concerns relevant to the practical use of <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters</b> are sustainabiliy, survivability, and maintainability. And of course, it is also necessary to maximize the capture per unit area of the structure as well as to minimize the cost. In this review, we consider some of the questions related to the topics of sustainability, survivability, and maintenance access, with respect to sea conditions, for generic <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters</b> with an emphasis on the oscillating wave surge converter (OWSC). New analytical models that have been developed are a topic of particular discussion. It is also shown how existing numerical models have been pushed to their limits to provide answers to open questions relating to the operation and characteristics of <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters...</b>|$|R
40|$|Oscillating {{water column}} (OWC) <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters</b> (WECs) are {{probably}} the simplest and most promising <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters</b> due to their good feasibility, reliability and survivability in practical <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> conversions and also regarded as the most studied and developed {{when compared to other}} types of the <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters.</b> This research aims to develop a reliable numerical tool to assess the performance of the OWC <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters,</b> particularly in the primary <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> conversion. In the numerical assessment tool, the hydrodynamics of the device and thermodynamics of the air chamber can be studied separately. However, for the complete dynamic system when a power take-off (PTO) system is applied, these two dynamic systems are fully coupled in time-domain, in which the PTO can have a simple mathematical expression as the relation between the pressure difference across the PTO (the chamber pressure) and its flowrate through the PTO. And the application of a simple PTO pressure-flowrate relation very much simplifies the complicated aerodynamics and thermodynamics in the air turbine system so the whole dynamic system can be simplified. The methodology has been applied to a generic OWC device and the simulation results have been compared to the experimental data. It is shown that the developed numerical method is reliable in and capable of assessing the primary <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> conversion of oscillating water columns...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} work a Geographical Information System (GIS) based {{methodology}} to identify locations {{suitable for the}} installation of <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters</b> has been developed. Parameters of importance have been identified and a GIS-database has been set up, containing data about the marine environment. In {{a case study of}} the Swedish west coast the methodology has been applied, resulting in a number of maps showing possible areas. The results show that large areas are suitable for installation of <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters,</b> from a technical and economical point of view. When consideration is taken to other interests in the area, such as navigation, fishing and environmental protection, the size of the suitable area diminishes considerably. However, the results should be interpreted with caution. Thorough investigations of the environmental impact of <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters</b> or detailed calculations of the costs and revenues have not yet been undertaken, because <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> conversion is a quite new energy technology. The results of the study are therefore mainly based on assumptions. Before the results {{can be used as a}} support for decision-making, the methodology, the GIS-data and the knowledge about <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> need further improvement. ...|$|R
30|$|Operation and {{maintenance}} {{are needed to}} maintain the optimum mechanical performance of the wave farm through an increase in productivity and reduction in running costs of <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters</b> [29]. The design for reliability {{and maintenance}} schedules need to be cautious {{due to the fact}} that system failures can be aggravated and there may be no appropriate weather window immediately available to retrieve the devices in case of failure [30]. Consequently, the plan to install a <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> device in the offshore areas of Mauritius should come with an appropriate maintenance strategy. There exists several maintenance strategies for <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters</b> which includes corrective strategy performed after failure or preventive strategy done before a breakdown.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} fix-referenced and self-referenced <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters</b> and a comparison of their corresponding <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> conversion capacities from real seas. For conducting the comparisons, two popular <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters,</b> point absorber and oscillating water column, and their power conversion capacities in the fixed-referenced and self-referenced forms have been numerically studied and compared. In the numerical models, the device’s power extractions from seas are maximized using the correspondingly optimized power take-offs in different sea states, thus their power conversion capacities can be calculated and compared. From the comparisons and analyses, it is shown that the energy conversion capacities of the self-referenced devices can be significantly increased if the motions of the device itself can be utilized for <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> conversion; and the self-referenced devices can be possibly designed to be compliant in long waves, which {{could be a very}} beneficial factor for device survivability in the extreme wave conditions (normally long waves). In this regards, the self-referenced WECs (<b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters)</b> may be better options in terms of <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> conversion from the targeted waves in seas (frequently the most occurred), {{and in terms of the}} device survivability, especially in the extreme waves when compared to the fix-referenced counterparts...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{desire for}} using {{renewable energy sources}} throughout the world {{has resulted in a}} considerable amount of research into and development of concepts for <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters.</b> By now, many different concepts exist, but still, the <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> sector is not at a stage that is considered commercial yet, primarily due to the relatively high cost of energy. A considerable amount of the <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters</b> are floating structures, which consequently need mooring systems in order to ensure station keeping. Despite being a well-known concept, mooring in <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> application has proven to be expensive and has a high rate of failure. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} further improvement, investigation into new concepts and sophistication of design procedures. This study uses four Danish <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters,</b> all considered as large floating structures, to investigate a methodology in order to find an inexpensive and reliable mooring solution for each device. The study uses a surrogate-based optimization routine in order to find a feasible solution in only a limited number of evaluations and a constructed cost database for determination of the mooring cost.

The concentration of several devices on one platform could offer a potential for both economic and operational advantages. Wind and <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters</b> can share the electrical cable and power transfer equipment to transport the electricity to shore. Access to multiple generation devices could be simplified, resulting in cost saving at the operational level. Overall capital costs may also be reduced, provided that {{the design of the}} foundation can be adapted to multiple devices with minimum modifications. Finally, the WindWaveFloat confers the ability to increase energy production from individual floating support structures, potentially leading to a reduction in levelized energy costs, an increase in the overall capacity factor, and greater stability of the electrical power delivered to the grid. The research conducted under this grant investigated the integration of several <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> device types into the WindFloat platform. Several of the resulting system designs demonstrated technical feasibility, but the size and design constraints of the <b>wave</b> <b>energy</b> <b>converters</b> (technical and economic) make the WindWaveFloat concept economically unfeasible at this time.
