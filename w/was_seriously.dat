When the hotel <b>was</b> <b>seriously</b> damaged by fire in 1946, Brundage spent about $2.5 million remodeling and modernizing it.

5|$|After the {{assassination}} of the King at the Stockholm opera in 1792, support for the liberal arts was withdrawn.

5|$|After the war, {{construction}} and reconstruction work resumed on the A3 motorway.

Similarly, unexploded ordnance and minefields left around the motorway had to be removed by minesweepers. The motorway pavement <b>was</b> <b>seriously</b> deteriorated, as evidenced by extensive ruts and cracks incurred during the four-year wartime period. Unlike repairs made to the viaducts and flyovers, mine clearance and pavement reconstruction took considerably more time to perform.|$|E

He told his brother and eldest daughter that he sensed his time had come.|$|E
