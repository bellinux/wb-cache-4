Falle was brainwashed to believe that her only worth lay in prostitution, which she later said was <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> her so long to exit prostitution. While engaging in prostitution, Falle was frequently threatened by other women in the sex industry, she was verbally abused by her clients, she was stalked, and she was threatened with guns on multiple occasions, including by her pimp. She was also drugged several times, and was once sexually assaulted by an escort driver after having been drugged by him. At one point, she was kidnapped. She had to resort to pulling a knife on people at times when she was threatened with violence. Because of various instances of violence during her time in prostitution, Falle was injured in a variety of ways. Her pimp broke several of her bones and burned her body.|$|E

500|$|The exact {{cause of}} the sinking was also the subject of dispute. Barère's account {{describes}} Vengeur as sinking from the shots that would have holed her hull; actually, Cyprien Renaudin mentions only two such holes in the lower hull of Vengeur and a noise [...] "like a strong waterfall" [...] at the poop, which he could not identify; {{this is consistent with}} James' account of [...] "the Brunswick, by a few well-directed shot, split the Vengeur's rudder, and shattered her stern-post besides making a large hole in her counter, through which the water rushed in great quantity." [...] In any case, the superstructures were very much battered, prompting Lieutenant Rotheram, of Culloden, to report that he [...] "could not place a two-feet rule in any direction, he thought, that would not touch two shot-holes". Claude Farrère attributes the sinking to ineptitude of the crew who had failed to close damaged lower gunports. The later study conducted by Captain Diaz de Soria in the 1950s suggests that water did enter from the gun ports of the lower battery, ripped off in the collision with Culloden and shattered by artillery fire, and that the crew failed to obstruct them with temporary contrivances. The panicking crew would have aggravated the situation by failing to man the pumps, explaining <b>why</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> four hours for Vengeur to sink between her surrender around 14:00 until her sinking between 18:00 and 18:30.|$|E
