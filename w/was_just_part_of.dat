25|$|Religion was not {{stressed}} at the school, but <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the curriculum. Many alumni were, {{in their}} adult lives, agnostic or irreligious. Nonetheless, those {{who wished to}} observe traditional Friday evening observances and holidays {{were able to do}} so with similarly interested staff. Most Bunce Court pupils were from families that had assimilated into the local culture and the children knew little about Jewish culture. Nazi persecution and discrimination made them aware of their Jewishness, so that in England, the school added courses on Jewish history, the teachings of Jewish prophets and the ideas of Jewish philosophers like Maimonides and Spinoza. These courses were taught by Hanna Bergas.|$|E
25|$|Stanley Gilkey, {{a sophomore}} from New Hampshire {{and the son}} of a Congregational minister, was {{probably}} an active homosexual, but he successfully lied to the Court about his associates and judgments. The Court expelled him for associating too closely with Roberts, for demonstrating an interest in the subject of homosexuality, and for claiming the ability to recognize homosexuals. He admitted reading works by Havelock Ellis, but explained that his interest in homosexuality <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> his more general interest in criminology. Though expelled, the Court had no evidence he had participated in homosexual activity. His request to be readmitted was granted in 1921 and he graduated in 1923. He lived in Paris for two years, then returned to the U.S., where he produced ten Broadway shows over 20 years. He died in Pacifica, California in 1979.|$|E

She had struggles with finding the character's villainies. Initially the character was [...] "too sexual," [...] then she lacked fun.

Carmen Electra tries to explain, but Homer is too busy looking at her breasts. Chief Wiggum, on the other hand, is irritated that the police department used was wasted on what turned out to not even be a real case, but he learns he will be in the show and Eddie and Lou will be given producer credits.|$|E

Although everyone else goes back to work even more stressed out, Michael refuses to give up, and continues playing the game with Dwight. After the game, Andy and Erin meet at the receptionist desk, where Erin asks him about their upcoming date.

2500|$|Hughes {{took to the}} {{leadership}} role with enthusiasm, boasting of a [...] "new era".

While he sat in the dressing room, the Australian team, desperate to end the Pakistan tenth-wicket partnership [...] "Mankaded" [...] (run out the batsman at the non-striker's end before bowling the ball) Sikander Bakht. During Australia's second innings, Andrew Hilditch picked up the ball after a return from a fieldsman and, in an attempt to be helpful, handed it to Sarfraz. Sarfraz appealed for a handling the ball dismissal, and Hilditch was given out by umpire Tony Crafter. While within the laws of the game, both dismissals were generally seen as unsportsmanlike. Hughes said of his own team's actions, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> cricket" [...] while condemning the actions of Sarfraz: [...] "It just wasn't cricket". In the end, Australia won the second Test and tied the series one Test apiece. Hughes had started his Australian captaincy with a win.|$|E
2500|$|The linear {{formation}} of the musketeer {{part of the company}} (the pike square remained in force) <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the total tactical reform. Older armies had divided the total force in three parts (hence the Spanish word [...] "tercio" [...] for each of these parts): a van, main, and rear, which in the Spanish conception were little differentiated, though the companies were deployed in a chequerboard formation for mutual support. The two stadtholders tried to improve on this by dividing their army into tactical units of around 900 men (6 companies), called [...] "battalions," [...] that could operate independently. They hoped in this way to gain flexibility and spread the risk of a rout when single units broke under attack. These battalion units were deployed chequerboard-like in three lines, again for mutual support. This method of deployment enabled the commander to rotate companies in a disciplined way, again to avoid confusion. Battalions were combined to brigades as fighting formations. To achieve this tactical flexibility companies had to drill in battalion formation. All units had to drill in the same way. Furthermore, before the campaign the commander-in-chief would communicate his preferences as to the battle formation to his officers by drawing up a battle sketched plan which gave the order of battle in a standardized notation. These methods were promoted by William Louis' brother John VII, Count of Nassau, who wrote several works about the techniques that received wide distribution in military circles in Europe. Later, drill manuals were published to illustrate the new tactics step by step, like the 1607 Wapenhandelinghe van Roers Musquetten ende Spiessen by Jacob de Gheyn II. This helped to engender a tactical military revolution in other countries also. The new tactics eventually even reached the English army, {{just in time for the}} Civil War.|$|E
2500|$|Vidal's claim about a homoerotic subtext is hotly debated. Vidal {{first made}} the claim in an {{interview}} in the 1995 documentary film The Celluloid Closet, and asserted that he persuaded Wyler to direct Stephen Boyd to play the role {{as if he were a}} spurned homosexual lover. Vidal said that he believed that Messala's vindictiveness could only be motivated by the feeling of rejection that a lover would feel, and suggested to Wyler that Stephen Boyd should play the role that way, and that Heston be kept in the dark about the Messala character's motivations. Vidal further claimed that Wyler took his advice. Whether Vidal wrote the scene in question or had the acting conversation with Wyler, and whether Wyler shot what Vidal wrote, remain issues of debate. In 1980, Wallace biographers Robert and Katharine Morsberger said that Vidal's contribution to the script remained unclear. Heston has asserted that Wyler felt Vidal did not solve the problem of motivation, and that Wyler shot little of what he wrote or made little contribution to the script. Wyler himself says that he does not remember any conversation about this part of the script or Boyd's acting with Gore Vidal, and that he discarded Vidal's draft in favor of Fry's. Film critic Gary Giddins also dismisses Vidal's claims, concluding that 80 percent of the script had been written [...] "years before" [...] Vidal came aboard the production. However, Jan Herman, one of Wyler's biographers, asserts [...] "there is no reason to doubt" [...] Vidal's claim, and that Wyler's inability to remember the conversation <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the director's notorious caginess. There appears to be some contemporary support for Vidal's assertions. [...] Morgan Hudgens, publicity director for the film, wrote to Vidal in late May 1958 about the crucial scene, and implied there was a homosexual context: [...] "...the big cornpone [...] really threw himself into your 'first meeting' scene yesterday. [...] You should have seen those boys embrace!" [...] Film critic F. X. Feeney, in a comparison of script drafts, concludes that Vidal made significant and extensive contributions to the script.|$|E

She could shed it all, and her cleverness too, as easily as a swan water-drops. What could she not shed, and yet remain Fanny? And with all her confidences, she was extremely reticent. A lift of the light shoulders, or of the flat arched eyebrows, a sarcasm, a far-away smile, at the same time illuminated and obscured her talk. These are feminine gifts, and yet past my mastery. Perhaps for this reason I admired them the more in Fanny--just as, in reading my childhood's beloved volume, The Observing Eye, I had admired the crab's cuirass and the scorpion's horny rings--because, being, after all, myself a woman, I faintly understood their purpose.|$|E
