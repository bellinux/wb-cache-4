I can't even get my dad to talk about Pet Sounds anymore.... The hymnal aspect {{of many of these}} songs seems no less pronounced, and the general air of deeply heartfelt love, graciousness and the uncertainty that any of it will be returned are still affecting to the point of distraction." [...] Music journalist Robert Christgau felt that Pet Sounds was a good record, but believed it had become looked upon as a [...] Composer Atticus Ross explains that the album has [...] "an element of cliché that's grown around it". He references a sketch from the television show Portlandia in which [...] "your classic hipster musicians... are building a studio and everything is like 'this is the mike they used in Pet Sounds.'

Maloney mused: [...] "The songs on Pet Sounds are great, but you have to wonder, given all the hype and mythology and our love of shallow nostalgia, what we mean when <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> classic or Wilson a genius.

As a matter of fact, even the Druids themselves are quite modern and commonplace personages compared with the short, squat chieftains of the long barrows.
