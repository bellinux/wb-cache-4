40|$|Many European {{countries}} face high nutrient loadings and {{the scientific}} community is asked to provide tools and methodologies to quantify {{the pressure on the}} environment originating from agriculture. This paper presents a tiered approach for addressing nutrient fate at various scales that makes best use of readily available data at EU level. A statistical nitrogen source apportionment model is applied in the Loire and Vilaine river basins to identify areas with highest losses. The physically-based model SWAT is then used to identify within those areas, the major processes and pathways controlling nutrient losses. It is shown that groundwater is the major contributor to total nitrate load in the streams. Finally, the farm-scale model EPIC is used to elaborate appropriate farming practices. It is predicted that using a <b>winter</b> <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> will reduce significantly nitrate leaching without endangering the farm economic sustainability. JRC. DDG.

The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the developmental dynamics of proteolytic and ammonification bacteria at different variants of manure application under maize (Zea mays L.). The trials were conducted at the Swadzim Experimental-Didactic Station (52 o 26 ’ N; 16 o 44 ’ E) which belongs to the University of Life Sciences in Pozna. The experiment was established in accordance with the random block design method and comprised 14 soil objects, each in four replications. The investigations were single-factorial and the factor levels comprised 8 methods of manure application in the case of maize grown for silage and 6 methods, when maize was grown for seeds.

This {{can be achieved by}} replacing the goal of maximum crop yields with the goal of minimal environmental impact. This paper presents results of integrated crop simulation system development for analysis of alternative planning strategies in agricultural land use, with focus on the crop rotation influence on environmental sustainability. The effective tools used in analysis include (1) long-term analysis of changes in agricultural land using a dynamic crop model with daily time step; (2) justification of arbitrary crop rotation scheme of different agro-technologies and sparing measures; and (3) analysis of modern farming management methods using model-oriented approach. The results of study also include estimation of two alternative practices of crop harvesting including remaining or removing whole crop residues from the agricultural field and their influence on basic parameters of soil fertility. In addition, we analyzed comparative efficiency of different agricultural measures neglecting the negative influence of possible climate changes in long-term consequences.

In 2006 – 2009, the plot experiment with winter pea in mixtures with rye and triticale was conducted under completely randomized design with four replicates. The productivity of mixture was above 10 t. ha− 1 whilst the significantly lowest value was observed for pea monoculture. The rye represented the most productive component in mixture but it achieved lower forage quality in comparison with triticale. The ratio of pea varied from 7 to 38 [*]% in dependence on year and companion cereal. The triticale mixture provided higher ratio in comparison with rye and significant differences between rye varieties were also detected. The quality of mixture was depended mainly on ratio of crops in the mixture. The ratio of pea significantly increased crude protein content in mixture according to linear regression where crude protein = 9. 56 + 0. 11 * weight percentage pea ratio (P < 0. 000, R 2 = 0. 89).

It is not always possible to use farmyard manure due to economic, production or technical reasons. <b>Catch</b> <b>crops</b> used as green manures can be an alternative source of organic matter. The experiment {{was carried out in}} central-east Poland (52 ° 06 ’N, 22 ° 55 ’E), in years 2008 – 2011. The successive effect of <b>winter</b> <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (hairy vetch, white clover, winter rye, Italian ryegrass, winter turnip rape) and the type of weed control on the growth and yielding of sweet corn was examined. The <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> were sown in early September, incorporated in early May. The effect of the <b>winter</b> <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> on yield was compared to the effect of FYM at a rate of 30 t·ha - 1 and the control without organic manuring. The sweet corn was grown directly after organic fertilization. Three methods of weed control was used: Hw – hand weeding, twice during the growing period, GCM – herbicide Guardian CompleteMix 664 SE, immediately after sowing the seed corn, Z+T – a mixture of herbicides Zeagran 340 SE + Titus 25 WG, in the 3 – 4 leaf stage sweet corn. The highest yields of biomass were found for winter rye (35. 5 t·ha - 1 FM and 7. 3 t·ha - 1 DM), the most of macroelements accumulated winter turnip rape (480. 2 kg N+P+K+Ca+Mg·ha- 1). Generally, leguminous <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> had similar to the FYM and better than non-leguminous <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> yield-forming effect. The highest yield of marketable ears of sweet corn was obtained after FYM (14. 4 t·ha - 1) and after hairy vetch <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> (14. 0 t·ha - 1).

40|$|All-arable {{organic farming}} systems, {{especially}} when they are working without organic fertilizer, are often in challenge with their nutrient management {{to fulfill the requirements}} of crops. In this context one of the main issues is to mitigate nutrient losses. Here the use of <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> may one strategy to counteract against this. We hypothesized that under the climate conditions of north-west Germany <b>winter</b> hard <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> are more suitable to reduce nitrogen (N) losses than <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> killed by frost, here especially with cereals or legumes as previous crop. In a field experiment in 2015 / 16 we tested 3 different <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (grown in pure stand and in mixture with legumes) after peas and triticale for their nitrogen loss paths over the winter period.

40|$|In {{maritime}} climates {{the production}} of winter wheat often leads to high nitrate leaching losses. In this study mixtures of <b>winter</b> wheat and <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> were analyzed as alternative growing system to avoid high leaching losses. In a field experiment pure winter wheat grown as control showed highest N-losses. Leaching losses of 140 kg N ha- 1 after the pre-crop grass-clover and of 50 kg N ha- 1 after oats as pre-crop were measured. Compared to this, growing winter wheat in mixture with forage rape or oats reduced nitrate leaching by 50 %. Common vetch as mixture partner to winter wheat had a lower potential to reduce leaching losses. Comparable results were obtained growing the <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> alone followed by spring wheat.

Profiles over bare soil or very short canopies could be described well by fitting Monin-Obukhov-like profiles, and the derived fluxes of momentum and all three scalars matched well those of a nearby eddy-covariance station. In green canopies during the day, CO 2 profiles clearly indicated the plant sink and soil source by a local minimum in the canopy and a maximum at the soil surface. H 2 O profiles, indicating sources both in the canopy and at the soil surface, {{did or did not}} show a local minimum between both, depending on canopy structure and turbulence. Temperature profiles showed various shapes including solar incident angle effects, and often the expected opposing signs of thermal stability between the subcanopy and the roughness sublayer.

The litterbags were sampled after 6 weeks in the field. In vetch, bacterial and fungal biomasses were similar whereas fungi dominated microbial biomass in rye. The biomass of the bacterial consuming fauna dominated by nematodes and microarthropods was similar to the biomass of bacteria in vetch as opposed to in rye where bacterivore biomass was lower than bacterial biomass. This suggests a much higher bacterial production in vetch compared to rye. Furthermore, in vetch dauer larvae of bacteria feeding nematodes prevailed, which is also a sign of high bacterial production followed by food shortage for the bacterivores. Bacterivorous and predatory nematodes with capability of consuming protozoa showed an inverse relationship to flagellated protozoa. This suggests that these nematodes controlled the protozoan biomass constituting a lower fraction of the bacterivore biomass in vetch compared to in rye. Such intraguild predator–prey relationship is therefore indicated for microbivorous organisms among bacterivorous and predatory nematodes (the intraguild predator) protozoa (the intraguild prey) and bacteria (the common prey). The much higher fungal biomass in rye than in vetch litterbags was not reflected in the biomass of the fungal feeders. Due to the generally lower intrinsic rate of increase of the fungivores, {{as well as of the}} omnivores and predators, in comparison with the bacterial feeders, they were not able to generate dense populations at this early stage of decomposition...|$|R

Especially with winter wheat intercropping with <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> increased N-uptake in autumn. In all stands forage rape and oats led to a higher N uptake than common vetch. In comparison to pure sown winter wheat, intercropping reduced Nmin by more than 30 %. Nitrate leaching was highest after grass clover.

A long-term field trial was thus established in Frick, Switzerland in 2002 on a clayey soil and with a mean precipitation of 1000 mm/year. The tillage experiment distinguished between conventional tillage with mouldboard ploughing (CT, 15 cm depth) and reduced tillage (RT), including a chisel plough (15 cm) and a stubble cleaner (5 cm). Results of a 2 -year grass-clover ley (2006 / 2007) and silage maize (2008) are presented. Due to dry conditions, mean grass-clover yields were 25 % higher in RT than in CT, indicating better water retention of RT soils.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to explore the possibility to use clover <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> instead of ryegrass in organic crop production on coarse sand. Two field experiments were performed, which included different animal manure regimes and different soil K- and N-levels. The residual effect of the clover <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> on the yields of a succeeding spring barley test crop was significantly higher than for the ryegrass. When animal manure (70 kg total-N ha- 1) was added to the succeeding spring barley in the ryegrass system the difference between the clover and ryegrass <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> disappeared. Thus clover appeared to have the potential for substituting animal manure. Leaching of nitrate-N and K were estimated by means of porous ceramic suction cups installed at 0. 8 m depth. The annual N leaching from a spring barley reference treatment without <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> were approximately 100 kg ha- 1. Clover and ryegrass <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> reduced the losses significantly by 40 to about 80 % depending on the year, and {{there were no significant differences}} between the two <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> types. However, there was a tendency to higher N-leaching losses after clover. Both the clover and ryegrass <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> reduced the annual flow-weighted nitrate concentrations from 13 - 16 mg L- 1 to 5 - 8 mg L- 1, which is below the WHO maximum for drinking water. The <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> did not affect the K leaching significantly, because a relatively larger amount of K than N was leached during the winter period, where the activity of the <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> is low.

40|$|Abstract - In {{organic farming}} winter wheat is {{typically}} grown after good pre-crops, as it pays well for {{this in terms}} of yield and quality. However, winter wheat develops slowly during the autumn, and much nitrate may be lost by leaching before spring. System with <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> followed by spring wheat, or maybe <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> intercropped with <b>winter</b> wheat could improve the utilization of the pre-crop effects in wheat crop-ping. In this experiment we studied wheat and <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> root growth, crop and soil N dynamics, and ef-fects on yield and baking quality in wheat <b>cropping</b> systems with <b>catch</b> <b>crops.</b> The results showed that the combination of <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> and spring wheat increased the yield and decreased the gluten content, but the bread volume was unaffected by the decrease in gluten Intercropping systems with <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> and <b>winter</b> wheat showed some promising results, but they are also very difficult to manage.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{perennial}} ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> and their short- and long-term effects on nitrogen leaching and nitrogen turnover in soils. Results are presented from three field experiments on a sandy soil in south-west Sweden, where undersown <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> {{were used in}} cropping systems with and without applications of liquid manure. The effects of different tillage practices on soil mineral nitrogen and leaching were also studied. Two coupled simulation models, which describe water flow and nitrogen transformations and transport in soil, were used for calculations of nitrogen mineralization and soil nitrogen balances. A more detailed study of the residual effects of ryegrass on the nitrogen supyly to the subsequent crops and nitrogen leaching was performed in lysimeters, using 'N-labelled ryegrass. Undersown <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> efficiently reduced nitrogen losses when mineral fertilizer or manure was applied at normal rates (90 - 1 10 kg Nha). Over five years, undersown <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> reduced nitrogen leaching by 60 %, on average, compared with soil which was conventionally tilled in August-September. Incorporation of <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> affected nitrogen mineralization mainly during the first growing season following incorporation, when approximately 20 - 30 % of <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> nitrogen was released. The results {{emphasize the importance of}} an early onset of nitrogen mineralization in spring after incorporation of <b>catch</b> <b>crops.</b> This is necessary in order to overcome the soil-depletion effect of nitrogen uptake induced by the <b>catch</b> <b>crop.</b> Simulations showed that incorporation of <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> material in late autumn instead of spring can result in a time distribution of nitrogen mineralization more suitable for a subsequent cereal crop, but this was not verified by the results of the lysimeter experiment. It seems important to obtain further knowledge of how to improve the degree of synchronization between nitrogen mineralization after incorporation of <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> and nitrogen demand of the subsequent crops. According to simulations, {{the main part of the}} <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> nitrogen contributed to a long-term accumulation of soil organic nitrogen (+I 0 kg N per hectare and year), while it slowly declined in autumn-tilled soil given mineral fertilizer (- 30 kg N per hectare and year). However, the accumulation of soil organic nitrogen due to the <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> was very modest compared with the total amount of organic nitrogen in the soil...|$|R
40|$|<b>Catch</b> <b>crops</b> are {{generally}} grown {{during the period}} between two main crops to prevent nutrient leaching and thus reduce nutrient losses from the system. <b>Catch</b> <b>crops</b> in Finnish organic vegetable farms are sown after the incorporation of green manure crop to the soil or after the harvesting of vegetable crops with early harvesting times. Knowledge {{on the ability of}} various <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> in preventing nutrient leaching in vegetable farms located in northern latitudes is still scarce. We also have very limited knowledge of the effect of <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> on the yield of the succeeding vegetable crop. The aim of our on-farm study was to investigate the ability of contrasting <b>catch</b> <b>crops,</b> i. e. Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum), phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia), white mustard (Sinapis alba) and radish (Raphanus sativus) in producing above-ground biomass, collecting nutrients and preventing leaching after broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica L.) harvesting in a commercial organic vegetable farm. Our second aim was to study the effects of various <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> on the yield and nutrient status of a succeeding organic carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus L.) crop. Our results show differing capabilities of various <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> species in producing above-ground biomass and preventing nitrogen leaching. White mustard reached the highest aboveground dry matter yield, 1416 kg/ha, which was higher than that of Italian ryegrass, phacelia and radish. The dry mass of phacelia (933 kg/ha) was also clearly higher than that of Italian ryegrass and radish, which yielded only 291 kg/ha and 277 kg/ha, respectively. Mustard, phacelia and Italian ryegrass could prevent autumnal nitrogen leaching by 40 – 49 kg/ha. The weak performance of the radish <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> after broccoli cultivation was an unexpected phenomenon. This experiment should be repeated to confirm the suppressive effect of broccoli on radish growth. The <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> effect on the succeeding organic carrot crop was most negative for Italian ryegrass, and varied from negative (phacelia) to neutral (mustard) for the other tested <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> species. Our study suggests that the utilization of efficient <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> during crop rotation prevents soluble nutrient leaching from the organic field, but may have negative impacts on the productivity of succeeding vegetable crops...|$|R
40|$|<b>Catch</b> <b>crop</b> root {{growth and}} {{nitrogen}} (N) uptake from both shallower and deeper soil layers {{is important for}} N management in arable farming system particularly in climates where excess winter precipitation induces N leaching. We simulated the root growth and biomass yield of three common <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> [chicory (Cichorium intybus L.), fodder radish (Raphanus sativus L.) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) ] and their effect on soil mineral N in different soil layers by using the FASSET model. The simulated results of <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> root growth and mineral N in the soil profile were validated against two years (i. e. 2006 and 2007) of observations taken in Foulum and Flakkebjerg, Denmark. Fodder radish had the deepest root system and depleted N from deeper soil layers than chicory and ryegrass. The effect of these three <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> on N leaching and grain yield of spring barley was simulated for 30 years using the FASSET model. The simulations showed that the system with ryegrass <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> had a smaller amount of N leaching from 1 m depth than the system with other <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> and without <b>catch</b> <b>crops.</b> However, estimated total N leached from 2 m soil depth was the smallest in the system with fodder radish followed by the system with chicory, indicating that these <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> are capable for taking soil N also from below 1 m depth.

40|$|<b>Catch</b> <b>crops</b> might reduce {{sulphate}} leaching {{and thereby}} increase the overall S use efficiency in crop rotations. At 2 experimental sites in Denmark (a sandy loam and a coarse sand) S uptake of <b>catch</b> <b>crop</b> species was measured. Furthermore net release of S following incorporation {{of this material}} (S contents 0. 13 - 1. 03 %, C:S ratios of 40 - 329 and lignin content of 1 - 10. 8 %) was investigated in a pot experiment with spring barley in sandy soil. The <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> showed huge differences {{in their ability to}} sequester S. The best <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (legumes on sandy loam), sequestered 10 - 12 kg S ha- 1 and the poorest <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> (ryegrass and sorrel on coarse sand), sequestered less than 3 kg S ha- 1. The S mineralisation rates were highest for crucifers (57 - 85 % of total S added) and lowest for legumes (up to 46 % of total S added). Differences can partly be explained by the C:S ratio, whereas no significant relationship was found with the lignin content of the incorporated <b>catch</b> <b>crops.</b> The <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> may constitute a solution that can help avoiding S deficiency and increase synchrony between plant demand and available soil S in a crop rotation. However, the release of S will not fulfil the need of S demanding crops and even for cereals the mineralisation will most often only make a contribution. In the case of legume <b>catch</b> <b>crops</b> it is advisable to use a supplemental S source...|$|R
