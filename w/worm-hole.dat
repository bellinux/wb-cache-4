In this work, HCl injection experiments are performed on both short (6 inch) and long (20 inch) calcite cores to investigate the pore volume to breakthrough (PVBT) behavior. PVBT is defined as the volume of acid necessary to propagate the wormhole network from the inlet to the outlet of the core sample, divided by the pore volume of the core.

Results from core flood experiments show an increased PVBT for 20 inch cores compared to the 6 inch samples. Results from CAT scan experiments show enlarged <b>worm-holing</b> and face dissolution on the 20 inch cores compared to the 6 inch cores, due to increased acid spending at the same acid concentration, flow rate, and injection temperature.

We have analysed the effects of these structural variations on membrane interactions for human LL- 37, rhesus RL- 37, and orang-utan LL- 37, using several complementary biophysical and biochemical methods. CD and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy on model membranes indicate that RL- 37, which is monomeric and unstructured in bulk solution (F-form), and human LL- 37, which is partly structured and likely aggregated (A-form), bind biological membranes in different manners.

The prevailing definitions of the term âfacsimileâ focus on the technical means of reproduction and the âexactnessâ of the copy. However, these definitions do not manage to distinguish the concept of facsimile, from that of a âcopyâ or âreproductionâ. In spite of this and notwithstanding the rich diversity of products within the genre of facsimile, there seems to be a considerable consensus as to what can, and what can not, be called a facsimile. The common denominator â be it a digitized letter, a printed page reproduced in low resolution and presented in PDF-format, or a costly recreation of an entire manuscript complete with gold decoration and <b>worm-holes</b> â is the idea that the form of the original document produces meaning. But what is the nature of the meaning produced? Special attention is given to the so called, "art facsimiles", and the use of facsimiles within edition philology. As to the former, the facsimile is often presented as a re-creation of the original document. Its precious materials and meticulous workmanship appeal to the sensual experience of the facsimile as a physical object. As for the latter, facsimiles are used as tools for analysis, and are perceived as reproductions of texts as images bringing into focus, understanding as opposed to sensing.

[...] The first scribe made a point of carefully regularizing the spelling of the original document by using the common West Saxon language and by avoiding any archaic or dialectical features. The second scribe, who wrote the remainder, with a difference in handwriting noticeable after line 1939, seems to have written more vigorously and with less interest. As a result, the second scribe's script retains more archaic dialectic features which allow modern scholars to ascribe the poem a cultural context. While both scribes appear to proofread their work, there are nevertheless many errors. The second scribe was ultimately the more conservative copyist of the two as he did not modify the spelling of the text as he wrote but rather copied what he saw in front of him.

Judith was written by same the scribe that completed Beowulf as evidenced through similar writing style. <b>Worm-holes</b> found in the last leaves of the Beowulf manuscript that aren't present in the Judith manuscript suggest that at one point Beowulf ended the volume.

40|$|The cosmological {{constant}} is historically reviewed from its introduction in classical and relativistic cosmology through its modern quantum guise where {{it appears as}} a vacuum energy density. Limits on the empirical value are in glaring contradiction to the expectations of field theoretical calculations. Motivated by the natural connection between dilatation invariance and the extinction of the vacuum energy density, a phenomenological realization of a global scale symmetry is constructed. A complete treatment of such a realization {{in the context of}} a supergravitational toy model is calculated to one loop using an effective potential formalism. Particular attention is paid to the quantization of both supersymmetric and general coordinate gauges and to the concomitant ghost structure since traditional treatments have introduced non-local operators in the ghost Lagrangian and generating functional. Contributions to the effective potentid from the gravity sector are thus determined that contradict the literature. A particular class of tree-level scalar potentials that includes the 'no-scale' case is studied in the that space limit. While it is found that scale invariance can be maintained at the one-loop level and the {{cosmological constant}} made to vanish for all potentials in the class this is directly attributable to supersymmetry. A richer form of the Kahler potential or an enlarged particle content may facilitate the breaking of supersymmetry. Phenomenological consequences of supergravity are investigated through a one-loop calculation of the electromagnetic form factor of the gravitino. Should such a form factor exist a signature of the gravitino might be found in processes with unlabeled products such as $e sp+e sp- to nothing. $ It is found that the form factor vanishes to this order, the Lorentz structures generated being too impoverished to withstand a constraining set of polarization conditions. Finally the wormhole solution to the cosmological constant problem is examined in a semiclassical approximation. The notion that scalar field <b>worm-holes</b> must have associated conserved charges is questioned and a model of massive scalar field wormholes is delineated and proven to provide a counterexample. As the model allows baby universes nucleated with a certain eigenvalue of the scalar field momentum to classically evolve to a different value, competing semiclassical paths contribute to the same transition amplitude. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the novel semiclassical paths available to massive solutions cannot be overlooked in approximating the tunneling amplitude...|$|R
