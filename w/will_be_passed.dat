5|$|Treatment {{of chronic}} {{infection}} in women prior to or during pregnancy {{does not appear}} to reduce the probability the disease <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> on to the infant. Likewise, it is unclear whether prophylactic treatment of chronic infection is beneficial in persons who will undergo immunosuppression (for example, organ transplant recipients) or in persons who are already immunosuppressed (for example, those with HIV infection).|$|E
5|$|Such {{cooperation}} within {{species may}} have evolved {{through the process}} of kin selection, which is where one organism acts to help raise a relative's offspring. This activity is selected for because if the helping individual contains alleles which promote the helping activity, it is likely that its kin will also contain these alleles and thus those alleles <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> on. Other processes that may promote cooperation include group selection, where cooperation provides benefits to a group of organisms.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of Masonic ritual {{consists}} of degree ceremonies. Candidates for Freemasonry are progressively initiated into Freemasonry, {{first in the}} degree of Entered Apprentice. Some time later, in a separate ceremony, they <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> to the degree of Fellowcraft, and finally they will be raised to the degree of Master Mason. In all of these ceremonies, the candidate is entrusted with passwords, signs and grips (secret handshakes) peculiar to his new rank. Another ceremony is the annual installation of the Master and officers of the Lodge. In some jurisdictions Installed Master is valued as a separate rank, with its own secrets to distinguish its members. In other jurisdictions, the grade is not recognised, and no inner ceremony conveys new secrets during the installation of a new Master of the Lodge.|$|E

25|$|Cooperation {{in animals}} appears to occur mostly between relatives. Spending time and {{resources}} assisting a related individual may at first seem destructive to an organism's chances of survival but is actually beneficial over the long-term. Since relatives share part of the helper's genetic make-up, enhancing each individual's chance of survival may actually {{increase the likelihood that}} the helper's genetic traits <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> on to future generations.|$|E

25|$|Artificial {{selection}} is the controlled breeding of domestic plants and animals. Humans determine which animal or plant will reproduce and {{which of the}} offspring will survive; thus, they determine which genes <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> on to future generations. The process of artificial selection has {{had a significant impact}} on the evolution of domestic animals. For example, people have produced different types of dogs by controlled breeding. The differences in size between the Chihuahua and the Great Dane are the result of artificial selection. Despite their dramatically different physical appearance, they and all other dogs evolved from a few wolves domesticated by humans in what is now China less than 15,000years ago.|$|E
25|$|If the {{government}} {{agrees that the}} changes are worthwhile, a Bill is drafted, usually by Parliamentary Counsel. The Bill is read and debated {{in both houses of}} parliament before it is either rejected, changed, or approved. An approved Bill must then receive the assent then handed down to either the Governor (State) or the Governor-General (Commonwealth). And then it must be put to the people through a Referendum and only a majority vote of all the States will ensure that law <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>passed.</b> Parliament often delegates legislation to local councils, statutory authorities and government departments, for sub or minor statute laws or rules such as Road Rules, but all law is answerable to the Commonwealth Constitution.|$|E

They believed that death occurs if his/her spirit leave the body permanently by the evil spirit, Busao. So their burial custom starts with laying the corpse on the boat-shaped coffin, which will be celebrated from a week to five months (and even a year for respected people like datu). The tribe often throws feast for commemoration in a positive vibe. This body, together with the wooden boat will be burnt {{at the end of}} the long wake, where the liquid extract from burnt woods will be collected for eatery.

25|$|Through his experiments, Dobzhansky {{discovers that}} {{mutation}} of genes leads to evolution {{within a specific}} species. Adaptations play {{a large role in}} genetic drift, and it is known that genes and mutations influence this genetic drift in a particular environment. Mutations can result from external influences within the surrounding environment, especially if an organism inhabits an area with harsh living conditions. An organism can adapt to its environment in order to better suit its own needs. When an organism successfully adapts, it has higher survival and reproduction rates. Therefore, there is a higher chance that its genes <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> on to its offspring. Specific genes and alleles are then passed on to future generations to continue the trend of modern evolution that Dobzhansky presents in the book.|$|E
25|$|Even if agency {{workers had}} {{any of the}} {{entitlements}} under the Employment Rights Act 1996, there would still exist no requirement of equal pay for agency workers who do {{work of equal value}} compared to a permanent employer. An agency worker can be treated less favourably in his or her pay and conditions than someone doing exactly the same job, simply because they come through an agency. A proposed Temporary and Agency Workers (Equal Treatment) Bill sought to adjust this position, joining another ten pieces of employment discrimination law in the UK (on gender, race, disability, religion, sexuality, age, part-time work, fixed time work and trade union membership). After the Bill's second reading, the proposal was dropped and an older draft of a European Union Directive, the Temporary and Agency Workers Directive was revived, and passed by the European Parliament. This was possible {{for the first time in}} 2008 because the United Kingdom government dropped its opposition. In fact, the directive and the Bill are almost identical. It is understood that the law <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>passed,</b> but with a 12-week wait before agency workers will be eligible for equal pay and hours.|$|E

500|$|The novel {{opens in}} 1954 {{in the small}} logging {{settlement}} of Twisted River on the Androscoggin River in northern New Hampshire. A log driving accident on the river has just claimed {{the life of a}} young logger, Angel, who slipped and fell under the logs. Dominic Baciagalupo is the camp's Italian-American cook who lives above the kitchen with his 12-year-old son, Daniel. Dominic lost his wife, Rosie, 10 years previously when a drunk Dominic, Rosie and a logger and mutual friend, Ketchum, were dancing on the frozen river, and the ice broke and Rosie went under. Later another accident happens that changes the lives of Dominic, Daniel and Ketchum. [...] "Injun Jane", the kitchen's dishwasher and girlfriend of the local law officer, Constable Carl, is having an affair with Dominic. One night, mistaking her for a bear attacking his father, Daniel kills her with an eight-inch cast-iron skillet. Dominic takes Jane's body and deposits it on the kitchen floor of Carl's house, knowing that Carl <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> out drunk and will probably believe he killed her, as he often beat her up. Early the next morning Dominic and Daniel tell Ketchum what happened and flee Twisted River in case the bad-tempered Carl finds out what really happened.|$|E

Introduced by his niece, Caroline Kennedy, the senator said, [...] "It is so wonderful to be here. Nothing– nothing– is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight." [...] He then delivered a speech to the delegates (which he had to memorize, as his impaired vision left him unable to read a teleprompter) in which, reminiscent of his speech at the 1980 Democratic National Convention, he said, [...] "this November, the torch <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>passed</b> again to a new generation of Americans. So, with Barack Obama and for you and for me, our country will be committed to his cause. The work begins anew. The hope rises again. And the dream lives on."
