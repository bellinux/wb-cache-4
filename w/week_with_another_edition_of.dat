5000|$|Frithegod served Oda {{as one of}} the {{teachers}} of Oda's nephew Oswald of Worcester, but he is generally known for his Latin poem Breviloquium Vitae Wilfridi, a hexameter work based on Stephen of Ripon's prose Life of St Wilfrid. The subject of both Frithegod and Stephen's works was Wilfrid, a late 7th and early 8th-century bishop and saint. Oda ordered the Breviloquium to commemorate Oda's securing of Wilfrid's relics around 950. Preceding the poem is a prose description of the actual acquisition, supposedly written by Oda, but more probably, {{on the basis of the}} writing style, written by Frithegod. The historian Michael Lapidge describes the Breviloquium as [...] "one of the most difficult Latin poems written in pre-conquest England". It is 1400 lines and its meaning is not always clear, even when compared to the Life of St Wilfrid which was its basis. The poetic word adds nothing new to historian's knowledge of Wilfrid, being mainly a poetic exercise to show off Frithegod's writing. It contains a number of neologisms and Greek words, the rarity of some of which imply that Frithegod had some knowledge of the Greek language. The Breviloquium was influenced by Biblical hermeneutics, a type of study of biblical texts. A modern edition of the Breviloquium was published in 1950 <b>with</b> <b>another</b> <b>edition</b> appearing in the Biblioheca hagiographica latina series as number 8891.|$|R
