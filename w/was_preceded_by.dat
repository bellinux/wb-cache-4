40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} : (i) to describe {{the construction of the}} noun phrase (NP) functioning as the adverbial in the English clause; (ii)) to describe the semantic role of the noun phrase functioning as the adverbial (iii) to describe the verbs preceding the noun phrase functioning as the adverbial; (iv) to describe the prepositions preceding the noun phrase functioning as the adverbial when the noun phrase functions as the post-modifier of prepositional phrase.
