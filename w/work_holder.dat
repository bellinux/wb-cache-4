5000|$|The {{band and}} their record company, Polydor, decided {{to produce a}} Christmas hit. For {{inspiration}} Slade members Noddy Holder and Jim Lea looked at previous material they had written. Lea recalled a melody and verse {{he came up with}} while showering, and Holder recalled a song he had discarded in 1967, which he had written when the band were named the N'Betweens. It was entitled [...] "Buy Me a Rocking Chair", and was Holder's first solo <b>work.</b> <b>Holder</b> used the melody of this song for the chorus, and Lea's melody became the verse. After an evening out drinking, Holder worked through the night at his mother's house in Walsall to write the lyrics, which he completed in one draft. In a 2007 interview with the Daily Mail, he spoke about the song's creation:We'd decided to write a Christmas song and I wanted to make it reflect a British family Christmas. Economically, the country was up the creek. The miners had been on strike, along with the grave-diggers, the bakers and almost everybody else. I think people wanted something to cheer them up - and so did I. That's why I came up with the line 'Look to the future now, it's only just begun'. Once I got the line, 'Does your Granny always tell you that the old ones are the best', I knew I'd got a right cracker on my hands.|$|E

While most regular <b>Work</b> Permit <b>holders</b> are relatively happy and healthy, our study finds that 62 per cent of injury and salary claim workers meet the screening conditions for a Serious Mental Illness. We find that the three main drivers of psychological distress are (1) the housing problems of injury and salary claim workers, (2) threats of repatriation against both injured and regular workers, and (3) agent fee debt. We recommend a range of policy options to address these problems, including alternative housing for injury and salary claim workers; delinking Work Permit holders’ visas and employment contracts; and regulation of offshore migration agents...|$|R
50|$|States {{regulate}} {{school social}} work practice in different ways. Approximately 33 jurisdictions license or certify {{school social work}}ers.

The Illinois State Board of Education requires that all students applying to an educator licensure program take and pass the Test of Academic Proficiency (TAP) and submit an ACT plus writing certificate with composite score higher than 19-22 and the same should be dated less than 10 years before submission.
