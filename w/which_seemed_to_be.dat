25|$|What {{was perhaps}} most {{significant}} for the LXX, as distinct from other Greek versions, was that the LXX began to lose Jewish sanction after differences between it and contemporary Hebrew scriptures were discovered (see Disputes over canonicity).

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the crisis caused by the prospect of a new Catholic heir made William decide to invade the next summer as early as November 1687, but this is disputed. It is certain however that in April 1688, when France and England concluded a naval agreement stipulating that the French would finance an English squadron in The Channel, <b>which</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the beginning of a formal alliance, he seriously began to prepare for a military intervention and seek political and financial support for such an undertaking.|$|E

An early highlight came in a home draw against Mobberley in which Ian Cooper and Australian batsman Adam Watson both scored centuries in the same innings, a record previously made almost 100 years earlier. However it ended up being another tough year as Park managed just four wins <b>which</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> enough to keep them up with a month to go.

25|$|Many railfans have a {{fixation}} with steam locomotives, which sometimes also fascinate the general public, {{as seen by}} the attendance at stations to view steam-hauled railtours. Sometimes the appeal of trains is nostalgic, recalling an earlier era when the railroads {{played a central role}} in commerce and transportation, and the depot was the center of every town. Nostalgia may also result from the long, lonesome wail of the train's horn, which mimics vocalizations that want for a more simple time reminiscent of home, as heard in country or folk music worldwide. Sometimes the appeal is due to a fondness for large machinery that can be inspected and photographed up close. Sometimes there is an appeal of the scenery of the railroad running through open, uninviting terrain, or the gritty ambiance of the urban train yard. In this case, urban exploration poses a similar appeal. Some people were raised near streetcar tracks or railways. Everyday activities were associated with railroad, <b>which</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a part of life. This may lead to an interest in railcars, how they move, numbering, and other rail systems in the world and how they compare with their native ones. If these people move to another locale, their interest in railroads might be nostalgic.|$|E
25|$|After {{a pair of}} third-place {{finishes}} in 1985 and 1986, the 1987 Tigers faced lowered expectations – <b>which</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> confirmed by an 11–19 start to the season. However, the team hit its stride thereafter and gradually gained ground on its AL East rivals, eventually finishing with {{the best record in}} the Majors. This charge was fueled in part by the acquisition of pitcher Doyle Alexander from the Atlanta Braves in exchange for minor league pitcher John Smoltz. Alexander started 11 games for the Tigers, posting 9–0 record and a 1.53 ERA. Smoltz, a Lansing, Michigan, native, went on to have a long and productive career, mostly with the Braves, winning the Cy Young Award in 1996. The Tigers won the division this year but possibly gave up some of their future. The Tigers had a great season but despite their improvement, they entered September neck-and-neck with the Toronto Blue Jays. The two teams would square off in seven hard-fought games during the final two weeks of the season. All seven games were decided by one run, and in the first six of the seven games, the winning run was scored in the final inning of play. At Exhibition Stadium, the Tigers dropped three in a row to the Blue Jays before winning a dramatic extra-inning showdown.|$|E

25|$|A {{study of}} the elderly who were {{benzodiazepine}} dependent found withdrawal could be carried out with few complications and could lead to improvements in sleep and cognitive abilities. At 52 weeks after successful withdrawal, a 22% improvement in cognitive status was found, as well as improved social functioning. Those who remained on benzodiazepines experienced a 5% decline in cognitive abilities, <b>which</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> faster than that seen in normal aging, suggesting the longer the intake of benzodiazepines, the worse the cognitive effects become. Some worsening of symptoms were seen {{in the first few}} months of benzodiazepine abstinence, but at a 24-week followup, elderly subjects were clearly improved compared to those who remained on benzodiazepines. Improvements in sleep were seen at the 24- and 52-week followups. The authors concluded benzodiazepines were not effective in the long term for sleep problems except in suppressing withdrawal-related rebound insomnia. Improvements were seen between 24 and 52 weeks after withdrawal in many factors, including improved sleep and several cognitive and performance abilities. Some cognitive abilities, which are sensitive to benzodiazepines, as well as age, such as episodic memory did not improve. The authors, however, cited a study in younger patients who at a 3.5-year followup showed no memory impairments and speculated that certain memory functions take longer to recover from chronic benzodiazepine use and further improvements in elderly people's cognitive function may occur beyond 52 weeks after withdrawal. The reason it took 24 weeks for improvements to be seen after cessation of benzodiazepine use was due to the time it takes the brain to adapt to the benzodiazepine-free environment.|$|E

500|$|The soundtrack {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics; while several {{felt that it}} was an excellent album, others disagreed, finding it to be a good soundtrack but lacking in substance.

However, several reviewers commented on [...] "Kiss Me Good-bye", finding it {{to be one of the}} soundtrack's strongest areas. The singles for the soundtrack were very well received by critics, who found them to be very enjoyable but short in duration, and the piano album was considered by reviewers to be one of the best in the series. The game's soundtrack was nominated for a British Academy of Film and Television Arts award for Best Original Score.|$|E

500|$|Famitsu {{was less}} {{positive}} about the story, saying that the mix of different elements made it [...] "a bit hard to follow." [...] Parish positively noted connections to the second game, but finding the later story developments either confusing or weak, and disliked the way returning supporting characters had been changed. Petit said that those who wanted a straightforward story would be disappointed, and positively noted its exploration of existence, identity, and memory. Her main criticism was with the dialogue, which she referred to as [...] "stilted". Kolan also faulted the voice acting and localization, especially when compared to games such as [...] Gonzalez cited the story as intriguing, with [...] "plenty of plot twists". Parish and Petit were both highly critical of Aya's portrayal: Parish disliked both her outfit, which seemed to conform too much female stereotypes in video games, and the clothes-tearing mechanic, <b>which</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> included merely to flaunt her sexuality. Petit shared many points of criticism with Parish, also noting that Aya's portrayal of [...] "one-part action hero, one-part submissive sex object" [...] was wrong for a lead character, and that Aya's in-combat vocals were not suited to the game's situations. Reed referred to Aya as [...] " [...] sighing, whimpering lead character".|$|E
500|$|According to numismatists William D. Hyder and R.W. Colbert, [...] "Borglum, {{to put it}} mildly, was a temperamental {{artist who}} managed to offend most {{everyone}} with whom he worked". They note that [...] "Borglum's past insolence had not left him in the good graces of the art community" [...] and his designs met a hostile reception at the commission. Sculptor member James Earle Fraser, designer of the Buffalo nickel, rejected Borglum's initial design on July 22, eight days after they were received. [...] The inscription on the reverse included a tribute to Harding; Fraser deemed it inartistic. [...] Borglum submitted a second set on August 14, this was again rejected; the commission criticized the design, <b>which</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> only a segment of a larger one, rather than specifically designed to fit a half dollar. [...] Borglum wanted to ignore what he deemed [...] "damn fool suggestions", but the Association threatened to fire him {{if he did not}} complete the coin. Borglum was concerned the reverse was still too crowded, and proposed leaving off the eagle, but space was saved when Coolidge did not like the reference to Harding, and it was omitted. [...] With the eagle still in place on the reverse, Fraser finally approved the designs on October 10, 1924. [...] In all, Borglum made nine plaster models for the design.|$|E
