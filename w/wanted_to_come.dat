5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Mau {{attempted}} to verify his navigational {{knowledge of the}} wider Pacific by working as a seaman on an inter-island ship run by the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. From 1969 to 1973, Mau became friends with Mike McCoy, a Peace Corps volunteer stationed on Satawal. As well as marrying Mau's niece, McCoy sailed with Mau and they worked together on a project tagging turtles. McCoy became interested in Satawalese navigation, published several articles on the topic and {{kept in touch with}} the anthropologist Ben Finney, who was researching Polynesian navigation. When McCoy's assignment on Satawal ended, he asked Pialug if he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to Hawaii with him.|$|E
5|$|After being delisted by the Bombers, Hall was {{pursued by}} {{multiple}} clubs; he had offers from VFL sides Coburg, the Tasmanian Devils, Williamstown and Bendigo, {{as well as}} South Australian National Football League (SANFL) club West Adelaide, before deciding to sign with Devils because he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> home to family and friends. Hall started the 2004 season playing as a forward and, despite moving into the midfield by mid-season, {{he was still a}} regular goalkicker. In June he was named in the VFL representative squad to play against the West Australian Football League, but he missed out on the match due to a hip flexor injury that sidelined him for a month. Hall finished the home and away season in fifth place in The Mercurys Tasmanian Devils Player of the Year award and in equal third place in the Devils' best and fairest.|$|E
25|$|Denmark, Switzerland, Armenia and Poland are {{countries}} that have expressed interest in participating in future tournaments, but has so far (2017) not made any appearance. Denmark and Poland have in fact exited FIB. Armenia <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> already to 2011, but wasn't allowed to, as the tournament format at the time only allowed twelve teams and several more <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> Of the countries which still haven't taken part, at least India was also denied in 2011. Most probably also Lithuania. The reason for the 2011 tournament having only eleven teams, was a late cancellation from Australia, another country no longer an FIB member.|$|E

25|$|Ormonde {{was faced}} with a {{difficult}} task in reconciling all the different factions in Ireland. The Old (native) Irish and Catholic Irish of English descent ("Old English") were represented in Confederate Irelandessentially an independent Catholic government based in Kilkennywho <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to terms with King Charles I of England in return for religious toleration and self-government. On the other side, any concession that Ormonde made to the Confederates weakened his support among English and Scottish Protestants in Ireland. Ormonde's negotiations with the Confederates were therefore tortuous, even though many of the Confederate leaders were his relatives or friends.|$|E

They don't even have to have been there, but if they do, they understand even better. Here in prison they were with me a lot. They came every night, whether I wanted them to or not.

25|$|Lanying <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back to China after graduation. However, the {{political}} situation was not good. At that time, America needed a lot of scientists and wanted to keep international students. Many Chinese students {{were not allowed to}} go back home. Because of this situation, she decided to work in America for some time and learn more things and use them to develop her homeland in the future. By the recommendation of her professor in University of Pennsylvania, she decided to work as a senior engineer at the Sylvania Company which mainly worked for semiconductors. At that time, the company had failed many times in making mono-crystalline silicon. Lanying found out the problems and helped the company successfully making the silicon.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Empire Windrush, {{which was}} en route from Australia to England via the Atlantic, docked in Kingston, Jamaica, to pick {{servicemen}} who were on leave. The British Nationality Act 1948 had just been passed, giving the status of citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC status) to all British subjects connected with the United Kingdom or a British colony. Prior to 1962, the UK had no immigration control for CUKCs, who could settle indefinitely in the UK without restrictions. The ship was far from full, and so an opportunistic advertisement {{was placed in a}} Jamaican newspaper offering cheap transport on the ship for anybody who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and work in the UK. Many former servicemen took this opportunity to return to Britain with the hopes of rejoining the RAF, while others decided to make the journey just to see what England was like. The resulting group of 492 immigrants famously began a wave of migration from the Caribbean to the UK when the ship docked at the Port of Tilbury, near London, on 22 June 1948, and the name Windrush has as a result come to be used as shorthand for that migration, and by extension for the beginning of modern British multicultural society.|$|E

Initially to be called God Save Sex Pistols, it became known during the summer as Never Mind the Bollocks. According to Jones, [...] "Sid <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> down and play on the album, and we tried as hard as possible not to let him anywhere near the studio.

The directors began working on the short in June and by August were back in the recording studio with the cast to lay down vocal tracks. The production of Frozen Fever took six months. All of the animators from Frozen <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back to animate at least one shot on Frozen Fever, resulting in a large number of animator credits for a short film. They struggled to squeeze the animation phase of the short's production into a tight time slot in fall 2014 after animation wrapped on Big Hero 6 and before the studio's animators had to start working on subsequent features.|$|E
