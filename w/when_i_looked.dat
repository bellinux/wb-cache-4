Neither F-15 pilot had been informed that U.S. Army Black Hawks participating in OPC often carried auxiliary fuel tanks mounted on wings nor had either been instructed in the paint scheme that Iraqi Hind helicopters used, light brown and desert tan, which was different from the dark green color used by the Black Hawks.

500|$|According to the singer, she {{had written}} several songs prior {{to the release of}} Truth Serum. She confessed that both the writing and {{recording}} process of the EP was very emotional, and that the vocals of the songs were taken from her demos. Truth Serum is a concept record that details Lo's [...] "most intense" [...] relationship from beginning to end. That approach was unintentional, as Lo realized that the tracks talked about the relationship after she had picked them for the EP. She explained; [...] "I didn't plan to write it that way, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at the songs that I had when I was picking ones for the EP, I was like, 'Oh my god, here it is'. I didn't really figure out {{that it was going to}} be the full story right there until I looked and listened". Concerning the title of the EP, the singer decided to call it Truth Serum after she had picked the songs for it; she said in an interview that [...] "when you look at the songs, it's all about honesty and I'm really giving up a lot of myself in these songs; I'm not filtering anything. I felt that kind of speaks a lot for how truthful the EP is".|$|E

[...] "They were all drunk and shooting all over the place," [...] said neighbor Agha Lala. [...] According to The New York Times, one of the attack's survivors and [...] "at least five other villagers" [...] described seeing a number of soldiers, while some other Afghan residents described seeing only one gunman. [...] One mother-of-six, whose husband was killed during the incident, reported involvement {{of a large number}} of people: [...] "When they shot dead my husband, I tried to drag him into the house... I saw more than 20 people <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> out the house. The Americans pointed their guns at me and threatened me, telling me not to leave the house or they'd kill me." [...] An eight-year-old girl named Noorbinak, whose father was killed, reported that [...] "one man entered the room and the others were standing in the yard, holding lights." [...] The brother of another victim claimed his nephews and nieces had seen [...] "numerous soldiers" [...] with headlamps and lighted guns. [...] Some elected officials said that they believed the attack was planned, claiming that one soldier could not have carried out such an act without help. In response, Afghan President Hamid Karzai appointed General Sher Mohammad Karimi to investigate the claims.|$|E

At the age of 19, while attending Wayne State University in Detroit, Ellison converted from Catholicism to Islam, later giving the following explanation: [...] "I can't claim that I was the most observant Catholic at the time [...] I had begun to really look around and ask myself about the social circumstances of the country, issues of justice, issues of change. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at my spiritual life, and I looked at what might inform social change, justice in society...

Erdős won the bet, but complained that during his abstinence, mathematics had been set back by a month: [...] "Before, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> at a piece of blank paper my mind was filled with ideas.

2500|$|Stewart {{grew up in}} a poor {{household}} {{with domestic}} violence from his father, an experience which later influenced his political and ideological beliefs. He spent much of his childhood in Jarrow. [...] Stewart's father served with the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry and was regimental sergeant major of the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment during the Second World War, having previously worked as a general labourer and as a postman. As a result of his wartime experience during the Dunkirk evacuation, his father suffered from what was then known as combat fatigue (related to what is now known as post-traumatic stress disorder). In a 2008 interview, Stewart said, [...] "My father was a very potent individual, a very powerful man, who got what he wanted. It was said that when he strode onto the parade ground, birds stopped singing. It was many, many years before I realised how my father inserted himself into my work. I've grown a moustache for Macbeth.

[...] The words of the preacher I did not know, but they sounded like the softy winds through a leafy forest and my eyelids were heavy. [...] Then I heard soft music and sweet voices, and a great cloud came down towards me, and when it nearly touched me, it opened and I saw {{in a blaze of}} light the girls with wings and they beckoned me. [...] And I was so certain that what I saw was that, I called out to my young men who were with me ‘Come and see what this is,’ and the young men replied, “You have been dreaming.’ But what I saw was true, for <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> around the great lodge afterwards, I saw on the walls the same girls with wings as I saw in my dreams.

2500|$|Ponting {{also had}} his first {{confrontation}} with Harbhajan Singh, an Indian off spinner {{who went on to}} have much success against him. In the Coca-Cola Cup series ODI against India in April, he and Mark Waugh put on more than 80 runs in 12 overs before Harbhajan was introduced into the attack. In the spinners second over, Ponting took him for four then lofted him over mid-wicket for six next ball. The following delivery saw Ponting use his feet in an attempt to get to the pitch of the ball but missed the shot and was consequently stumped. After the dismissal the pair clashed verbally. Ponting wrote, [...] "The Sharjah incident was the result of me being over-competitive but it had the potential to get quite nasty. I was really disappointed with the shot I played [...] and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> up Harbahjan was right in my face giving me the finger [...] and really mouthing off. Had he been a few more metres away from me I would have not reacted like I did or at the most I would have given him a bit of lip as I walked past. I just over-reacted to the provocation." [...] Both players were consequently fined ($500) and reprimanded by the match referee, with Harbhajan also suspended for a single ODI as he was adjudged to have breached the ICC Cricket Code of Conduct.|$|E
