It is possible to adopt the rate-distortion (RD) optimized mode in H. 264 to maximize the coding gain {{at the cost of}} a very high computational complexity.

However, because of the strong tie between decision and action, it {{has been difficult to}} dissociate these two processes in an animal's free behavior.

Using simple eye movement tasks in which the direction of a saccade was either instructed by a computer or freely chosen by the subject, we found that the preceding decision and action had different effects on the animal's subsequent behavior. While choosing a direction (previous decision) produced a positive history effect that prompted the choice of the same saccade direction, making a saccadic response to a direction (previous action) produced a negative history effect that discouraged the monkey from choosing the same direction. This result suggests that the history effect in sequential behavior reported in previous studies was a mixture of these two different components. Future studies on decision-making need to consider the importance of the distinction between decision and action in animal behavior...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. Hypothetical thinking involves {{the imagination of}} situations {{that we have not}} actually experienced. We may, for example, imagine the consequences of alternative actions available to us when <b>we</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision.</b> In such a case we would try to conduct a mental simulation of a possible world in order to work out the consequences of the action. The investigators have recently developed a new psychological theory of conditional statements of the form if p then q on the basis that these trigger a process of hypothetical thinking in which q is assessed in a mental simulation of p. This differs from standard logical and psychological accounts. Our theory has a number of psychological consequences for (a) how people decide whether they believe a conditional statement, (b) when they will assert conditional statements in everyday discourse and (c) the nature of the inferences they will draw from such statements. In a series of experimental studies we examine predictions of the theory with regard to all of these functions. In addition, we study individual differences in hypothetical thinking about conditional statements and their relation to measures of general intelligence. This involves the general claim that abstract hypothetical thinking is better developed in those of high IQ...|$|E

We will exemplify this by considering a multicriterion problem for a medical domain problem. Trigeminal Neuralgia (TN) is a pain that is described as among the most acute known to mankind. TN produces excruciating, lightning strikes of facial pain, typically near the nose, lips, eyes or ears. Essential trigeminal neuralgia has questioned treatment methods. We consider five different treatment methods of the essential trigeminal neuralgia for evaluation under several criteria. We give a multiple criteria procedure using evolutionary algorithms for ranking the treatment methods of the essential trigeminal neuralgia for the set of all evaluation criteria. Results obtained by our approach using a very simple method are the same as the results obtained by applying weighted sum method (which requires lots of domain expert input). The advantage of the new proposed technique {{is that it does not}} require any additional information about the problem (like weights for each criteria in the case of weighted sum approach). ...|$|E
