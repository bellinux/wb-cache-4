40|$|Biological invasions in {{wetlands}} by <b>Water</b> <b>Primroses</b> (Ludwigia grandiflora ssp. hexapetala and L. peploides ssp. montevidensis) are {{an increasing}} problem especially in wet meadows. The {{aim of this}} paper is to quantify differences between species and the adaptation of these amphibious plants in order to establish the consequences for site managers. The hypotheses were: (i) that these species differ in biomass and morphology, and (ii) that terrestrial habitats determine particular adaptations such as reduced biomass, more roots and a bushy form. Biomasses from five sites were collected, following seasonal changes and biological traits were measured on selected plants. Comparing species in aquatic habitats, L. peploides produced less biomass than L. grandiflora. Comparing habitats for L. grandiflora, the biomass in meadows was almost twice that in dykes, particularly due to old stems, the converse of the hypothesis. Terrestrial forms were characterized by a bushy morphology, with shorter internodes and stems, as well as more secondary ramifications, while in aquatic habitats the plant architecture was simpler. Models were built linking morphology to species, sites and water conditions. Adaptations to terrestrial habitats of a particularly resistant form with a significant potential biomass are practical constraints for farmers and managers...|$|R
5000|$|The preserve, {{a remnant}} wetland of a once-great watershed, is now {{surrounded}} by urbanity: 2 major freeways, 2 major boulevards {{and a large}} strip mall define its southern and eastern boundaries. A large residential area, 2 Senior housing complexes and a city park hug its northern and western boundaries. Today the Dominguez Watershed is a complex system of storm drains and flood control channels. The preserve’s wetlands are now fed by these storm drains, {{as well as by}} urban runoff and rain. It is possible that urban runoff, from activities such as excessive landscape irrigation and car washing, now brings water into the preserve in greater quantities and with greater regularity than occurred naturally. These factors may be favoring the growth of the [...] "willow dominated riparian forest" [...] (p I-8) and moving the preserve away from being a vernal marsh. Conversely, with this high density of urban markers, storm drains and urban runoff entering the preserve bring in nutrient-rich water, perfect for aquatic invasive species, such as <b>water</b> <b>primrose</b> (Ludwigia), a management challenge. If allowed to continue to invade the preserve, <b>water</b> <b>primrose</b> will soak up the water in the wetland and ultimately destroy the willows. Storm drains, boulevards and parking lots also bring in trash, which volunteers regularly clear out. In return, the native plants and soil of the preserve clean the storm drained water before sending it on to the Dominguez Channel which feeds to the Los Angeles Harbor and the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

40|$|Water in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta {{has three}} main uses: {{it serves as}} a habitat for the fish, irrigation, and a small amount of the water is {{distributed}} to the city. The presence of <b>water</b> hyacinth and <b>primrose,</b> two invasive plants, kills fish by depleting the oxygen in the water, they also interfere with shipping and clog the water channels. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies that include chemical, mechanical and bio-control have been used to eliminate <b>water</b> hyacinth and <b>primrose</b> at the delta. During this research, we obtained and analyzed pictures at the Delta and used their geospatial (longitude and latitude) information to calculate the presence of <b>water</b> hyacinth and <b>primrose</b> at different zones that were not chemically treated and other areas that were treated. Our analysis was object-based and we used ENVI software’s feature extraction tool to draw boundaries around the leaves of <b>water</b> hyacinth and <b>primrose</b> to segment the picture and create polygons. We used the polygons’s RGB (Red-Green-Blue) bands and their roundness to classify the polygons into six classes using ArcMap. Water hyacinth was seen in a lower percentage in our pictures because this year it rained more in the delta compared to 2015 and this allowed the plant to flow and be flushed out. An equation to calculate the velocity of the plant rafts can help to make predictions of the presence of water hyacinth at different sites in the Delta. This information will serve the economists to plan the mechanical and chemical efforts made to eradicate the plant.

40|$|Because of {{its great}} beauty, Eichhornia crassipes (Water Hyacinth), {{originally}} from South America, {{has been introduced}} to 4 continents. Furthermore, because of its genetic make-up, high versatility and resiliency, this plant has become a frightening invasive, affecting boating and shipping, farming, water quality and fishermen livelihood wherever it thrives. However, Water Hyacinth (WH) is only 1 of over 84 invasives in the California Delta, which is where we focused our study. We took photographs along the Delta in treated and non-treated areas, and used an ENVI segmentation tool {{to find the best}} parameters for discriminating <b>Water</b> Hyacinth and <b>Primrose.</b> Once those parameters were found, we created a set of rules that would convey the percent cover of each invasive and dead plant material inside every photograph. This would help to determine the effectiveness of 2, 4 -D herbicide treatment on the invasives. The rules we created where based on the average RGB band ratios, and minimum and maximum RGB values of <b>Water</b> Hyacinth, <b>Primrose,</b> detritus, and <b>water.</b> We found that the herbicidal treatment was indeed effective to reduce invasive coverage, and that overall there were more <b>Primrose</b> than <b>Water</b> Hyacinth. The best segmentation parameters we found still did not accurately separate the two plant species within a given photo graph, but performed well on photographs with only one species. This ultimately affected the percent coverage found, but we conclude that the percentages are still accurate. A literature review was also conducted by compiling information from previous research articles that were written in regards to Water Hyacinth, and implications were stated to influence future research. Furthermore, a map we created of Water Hyacinth in the U. S allowed us to conclude that this invasive will most likely spread to the Central U. S region if its growth is not impeded...|$|R

Maps of a large area and for inaccessible sites can be produced from remote sensing images. Remote sensing data are SPOT 5 data have been acquired during summer, when <b>water</b> <b>primrose</b> forms large and dense mats and is flowering, for the years 2003 and 2005. For these years, maps of L. grandiflora distribution are available. In order to use a supervised classification, nine classes have been identified with visual interpretation. Pixels are selected on a site where stands of L. grandiflora are large and dense. The defined classes are: <b>water</b> <b>primrose,</b> aquatic vegetation (few dense and with a lower spectral response in the near infrared than <b>water</b> <b>primrose),</b> 4 classes for crops, 2 classes for forest, and water. Firstly, no class for amphibious vegetation is defined, because it forms heterogeneous stands, with spatial variability in species and density. The classification based on these pixels is applied on two other sites, distant from 15 km: a marsh where mats of L. grandiflora are in mixture with water and other amphibious vegetation and a site with lakes and a network of channels.

Roderick, Chair To investigate the impact of invasive aquatic weeds on mosquito populations in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, field and laboratory experiments were conducted to test the impact of invasive aquatic plants (water hyacinth, <b>water</b> <b>primrose,</b> and Brazilian waterweed) on the behavioral ecology of Culex pipiens, a primary mosquito vector for West Nile Virus (WNV). In an outdoor caged experiment containing larval mosquitoes and predatory Mosquitofish, mosquito survival was significantly higher among high densities of the three plant species than vegetation-free water. In intermediate plant densities, mosquito survival was higher among water hyacinth than both Brazilian waterweed and <b>water</b> <b>primrose.</b> In low plant densities, mosquito survival was higher among water hyacinth than Brazilian waterweed and vegetation-free water. In another caged experiment containing mesocosms, mosquito larval development time was completed more rapidly in the presence of intermediate densities of water hyacinth than all other treatments. In an outdoor caged choice experiment, mosquitoes laid more eggs in mesocosms containing intermediate densities of water hyacinth than all other treatments. Laboratory choice tests and an olfactometer experiment revealed that mosquitoes were more attracted to water that contained plants or plant infusions than water alone. These results suggest that water hyacinth provides both physical and chemical cues to some species of mosquitoes. Effective management of invasive water hyacinth in waterways may thus reduce mosquito populations and reduce human health risk...|$|E

40|$|Waterways of the Sacramento San Joaquin Delta have {{recently}} become infested with invasive aquatic weeds such as floating water hyacinth (Eichhoria crassipes) and <b>water</b> <b>primrose</b> (Ludwigia peploides). These invasive plants cause many negative impacts, including, {{but not limited}} to: the blocking of waterways for commercial shipping and boating; clogging of irrigation screens, pumps and canals; and degradation of biological habitat through shading. Zhang et al. (1997, Ecological Applications, 7 (3), 1039 - 1053) used NASA Landsat satellite imagery together with field calibration measurements to map physical and biological processes within marshlands of the San Francisco Bay. Live green biomass (LGB) and related variables were correlated with a simple vegetation index ratio of red and near infra-red bands from Landsat images. More recently, the percent (water area) cover of water hyacinth plotted against estimated LGB of emergent aquatic vegetation in the Delta from September 2014 Landsat imagery showed a 80 % overall accuracy.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Contaminants such as nutrients, metals, and {{pesticides}} can interact with constructed wet-lands and existing drainage ditches used as agricultural best-management practices. Our {{research has shown}} that the presence of macrophytes and a hydrologic regime aid in the transfer and transformation of pesticides associated with agricultural runoff. This study consisted of application of both atrazine (triazine herbicide) and lambda-cyhalothrin (pyrethroid insecticide) to vegetated and unvegetated microcosms in order to measure the fate and effects of pesticides applied at suggested field application rates. Exposures focused on monocultures of Ludwigia peploides (<b>water</b> <b>primrose)</b> and Juncus effusus (soft rush). Pesticide sorption was evident through concentrations of atrazine and lambda-cyhalothrin in plant tissue as high as 2461. 4 and 86. 50 g/kg, respectively. Toxicity was measured in water from unvegetated microcosms for 28 days and in Chironomus tentans (midge larvae) exposed to sediment collected from 3 h to 56 days in microcosms receiving the pesticide combination.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In flooded meadows, Large <b>Water</b> <b>Primrose</b> (Ludwigia grandiflora ssp. hexapetala) {{has become}} an {{invasive}} weed since years in many Western marshes. Settlement occurs both by cuttings and seedlings. Our purpose was (i) to assess progressive colonization in three sites and (ii) to show adaptive traits of Ludwigia “terrestrial forms ” using another site with a strong moisture gradient, and (iii) to get recommendations for managers. (i) In the Natural Regional Park of Brière, colonization occurred through dykes. The first appearance was probably due to a dirty dredging engine. In Mazerolles polder, {{it was due to}} flooding and was increased by pumping in colonized dykes with much fragmentation. In Apigné meadow bad drainage led to colonization by Ludwigia. Field maps assess progressive colonization on many areas. (ii) Adaptation to land conditions led to reduced biomass of the whole plant and increased ratio between roots and stems. Cumulative stem length was only 21 cm in dry conditions, while it reached 2064 cm in aquatic forms. After settlement, plants are able to survive for years provided there is some remaining moisture in the soil. (iii) As a consequence for managers, barriers limiting dispersion of cuttings should be established in dykes but also along the hydraulic network leaving reed strips. Flooding events should lead to careful field survey to pick up the cuttings. The main problem is when fertile seeds are dispersed all over the area as in Mazerolles. No prevention exists, thus attempts of destroying Ludwigia mats are experimented...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEnvironmental {{temperature}} {{is the primary}} regulator of germination. Global climatic warming may substantially change seed dormancy and germination responses of wetland and riparian plant species. The potential for increased germination capacity, seed dispersal and geographic range expansion of invasive plant species is a particular concern relevant to the conservation of native biodiversity. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the germination capacity of Ludwigia hexapetala and Ludwigia peploides subsp. montevidensis from two invaded ranges under 3 degrees C warming predicted in climate change models. Germination of seeds collected from two invaded ranges was tested in controlled conditions at two air temperature regimes, 24 degrees C/ 14 degrees C and 27 degrees C/ 17 degrees C. Regardless of temperatures, the germination rates of studied species were greater than 80 % for L. hexapetala from California, and for two populations of L. peploides from France. Seeds of L. hexapetala from California germinated two-fold more than seeds from France, while L peploides from California germinated less quickly and at lower rates than two of three populations from France. The variation observed between invaded ranges could be interpreted as an adjustment of the germination responses of water primroses populations due to provenance environmental characteristics. The 3 degrees C warming treatment accelerated the time to germination of <b>water</b> <b>primrose</b> seeds from California and France, and was a driving factor in final germination percentage for L. hexapetala populations from France.

40|$|In Cambodia, the {{planting}} of rice lines with a competitive and/or allelopathic ability {{would be a}} very useful way to supplement weed management in the rain-fed, low-input production systems. The present study examines a wide range of rice germplasm, mainly from Cambodia, and uses a series of bioassay techniques to identify those that might have a weed growth-suppressing, allelopathic trait. A laboratory bioassay study that involved 359 rice lines showed that there were 15 that could significantly reduce the growth of awnless barnyard grass seedlings. In a second laboratory bioassay, involving the best 96 rice lines that were identified in the first study, 14 were shown to suppress the shoot growth of awnless barnyard grass, 11 could suppress the shoot growth of barnyard grass, six could suppress the shoot growth of small umbrella sedge, four could suppress the shoot growth of two-leaf fimbristylis, four could suppress the shoot growth of <b>water</b> <b>primrose,</b> and three could suppress the shoot growth of gooseweed. Of the 13 rice lines that were able to suppress the growth of at least two weed species, there were three lines that could suppress the growth of three weed species, one line that could suppress the growth of four weed species, and one line that could suppress the growth of five weed species. In a third soil-based, pot bioassay that studied the 18 best lines coming from the second laboratory bioassay, all showed a significant weed growth-suppressive ability. A linear regression analysis showed that there was no correlation between their weed growth-suppressive ability and their physical seedling size, supporting the idea that the growth suppression was allelopathic in nature and not a physical competition effect. In summary, the results indicate that an allelopathic trait does exist in some Cambodian rice lines and that this trait is effective in the growth suppression of a number of major rice weeds...|$|E
40|$|Alien {{plant species}} are rapidly {{spreading}} in aquatic ecosystems around the world, causing major ecological effects. They are typically introduced by humans, after which natural vectors facilitate their further spread. Migratory waterbirds {{have long been}} recognised as important dispersal vectors for native and aquatic plants, yet {{little is known about}} their role in the spread of alien species. We determined experimentally the potential for long-distance dispersal of native and alien wetland plants in Europe by two abundant waterfowl: mallards Anas platyrhynchos and greylag geese Anser anser. We fed seeds from two plants alien to Europe and two native plants to 10 individuals of each bird species, testing for the effects of bird and plant species on the potential for dispersal. Intact seeds were retrieved from faeces for up to 4 days after ingestion. The proportion of seeds retrieved intact varied significantly between plant, but not bird, species. Retrieval was highest for the invasive <b>water</b> <b>primrose</b> Ludwigia grandiflora (> 35 % of ingested seeds), lowest for the invasive cordgrass Spartina densiflora (< 3 %) and intermediate for the native glasswort Arthrocnemum macrostachyum and seablite Suaeda vera (5 - 10 %). Seed retrieval patterns over time varied between both plant and bird species. Contrary to expectations, seeds were retained in the gut for longer in the smaller mallards. No Spartina seeds germinated after retention for over 8 h, whereas some seeds of the other species germinated even after retention for 72 h. Germinability was reduced by gut passage for Ludwigia and Arthrocnemum seeds. Ludwigia seeds recovered from geese were more likely to germinate than those recovered from mallards. Time to germination was reduced by gut passage for Spartina and Ludwigia, but increased with retention time. Ducks and geese evidently have the potential for long-distance transport of alien and native plant seeds, with maximal dispersal distances of well over 1000 km. The much greater potential of Ludwigia than Spartina for dispersal by waterfowl is consistent with its faster expansion across Europe. Maximum retention times of wetland seeds have been underestimated in previous experimental studies that lasted only 1 - 2 days. Contrary to previous studies, wetland plants with large seeds, such as Ludwigia, can still show high potential for long-distance dispersal. More attention should be paid to the role of waterbirds as vectors of alien plants and to the role of migratory geese as vectors of plants in general...|$|E

The creeping or soft emergent macrophytes such as <b>water</b> <b>primrose,</b> water cress and pennywort (Ludwigia peploides, Nasturtium aquaticum, Hydrocotyle verticillata, Sagittaria latifolia) usually reached significantly lower biomass (average of about 450 gm- 2) but the biomass was richer in nitrogen (3 %). Representatives of the second group were also characterized by significantly faster decomposition rates. Methods of propagation of plants from rhizome and stem cuttings were elaborated. A greenhouse experiment carried out to determine the dependence of growth characteristics on water level showed that Hydrocotyle verticillata seemed to be most sensitive to low water levels followed by Nasturtium aquaticum. Ludwigia peploides grew well at all five tested water levels. Both Hydrocotyle verticillata and Nasturtium aquaticum were more sensitive to high nitrogen concentrations than Ludwigia peploides. The mesocosm experiment studying the effect of four different water levels on the growth and biomass allocation in tall erect emergents (Scirpus californicus, S. acutus, Typha domingensis, Phragmites australis) and short emergents (Polygonum sp., Scirpus robustus, Sagitta ria latifolia and Ludwigia peplaides) showed that with the exception of Typha domingensis, Sagitta ria latifolia and Scirpus robustus, all other species allocated more biomass into belowground organs in the low water level treatment than in the high water treatment. Results of this experiment in combination with the observations from the field are crucial for proper species selection for various treatment purposes. Five species, Scirpus californicus, S. acutus, Typha domingensis, Sagitta ria latifoia and Ludwigia peploides, were grown in outdoor hydroponic cultures in a heavy metal experiment. Zinc, lead, cadmium and copper in the concentrations of 0. 1, 1 and 10 ppm of were added to the nutrient solution in the cultures. After two weeks of exposure to the heavy metals, plants were measured, harvested, biomass was sorted into roots, rhizomes, stems and leaves, dried and analyzed for concentrations of individual metals. There were no statistically significant differences in the growth expressed as the percentage increment of total length between the control and all concentrations of all metals. However, there were species and organ specific differences in the accumulation of individual metals. Most metals were accumulated in roots, specifically adventitious roots. Ludwigia peploides seemed to be the most efficient in the accumulation of all metals tested...|$|E
