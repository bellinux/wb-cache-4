At that time, Kilduff estimated that the community would take approximately five years to be entirely built out, contingent on demand. Kilduff also believed that Aliante could rival the nearby Summerlin master-planned community. Aliante's first phase consisted of approximately 1,750 single-family detached homes, ranging from the mid-$100,000s to the upper-$200,000s. By the time of opening, the BLM was planning to auction the remaining 5595 acre {{over the next several}} years. Montandon said that Aliante's large number of expensive homes would help retain residents once they become financially successful, saying, [...] "One of the problems <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> people move out of North Las Vegas when they have a little success." [...] Montandon also said that for the first few years, Aliante would likely cost more money than it could generate in taxes: [...] "Rooftops are a drain on resources, police, fire and parks. But then come the restaurants and grocery stores." [...] At that time, it was expected that Aliante's casino would not be built for years. Construction began on Aliante's first commercial office building in September 2004, with a scheduled completion date {{in the second quarter of}} 2005. At that time, Aliante's first shopping center, anchored by a Smith's grocery store, was set to finish construction by fall 2005.|$|E
