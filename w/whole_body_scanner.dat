Further innovations included the development of active shielding, whereby fringe fields hazardous to pacemaker wearers, causing difficulty and expense in siting, were virtually eliminated.

M., Van de Water, G. J. <b>Whole</b> <b>body</b> <b>scanners.</b> Displays 19 : 111 - 120). Now, eight years later, we will present an update of available systems including software and new trends. Laser scanning systems are still the most accurate on the market, but expensive. For the apparel industry some laser systems are developed with less accuracy and lower costs. TC 2 is the leading company in patterned light projection scanners due to acceptable price setting. However, scanning accuracy {{is not as good}} as in laser scanning. A relatively new method is based on millimeter waves. These scanners can scan through clothing layers, but resolution is poor. Raw scans consist of point clouds. The clouds of each camera have to be aligned first and then merged into one single file. Some post processing is necessary to fill holes due to occlusion effects. Finally, if the processing is done accurately, and the scan is an exact copy of the body, software may be applied to derive additional body dimensions from the scan. The apparel industry is unfortunately still focused on 1 D dimension like chest circumference because 3 D techniques are still under development. The 1 D dimensions generated by the available software (Human Solutions, TC 2) are reproducible, but generally do not correspond very well to 1 D measures determined by skilled anthropometrists. The question is if the link should be established or if the results should be treated separately. Progress is made in the link between 3 D body scans and garment design with software packages like Vidya, Optitex and Narcis...|$|R

30|$|The Jagiellonian-Positron Emission Tomograph (J-PET) is {{the first}} PET {{composed}} of plastic scintillators. J-PET consists of 192 individual modules of dimension 500 X 19 X 7 mm 3.

The long strips of plastic scintillators used in J-PET provide superior timing properties, small light attenuation, larger axial field-of-view (AFOV) and thus qualify for the use in whole-body PET Imaging [1, 2, 3]. Moreover, using plastics as detecting material allow for constructing a cost-effective <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> <b>scanner.</b> A major advantage of the plastic scintillator is that the signals are very fast [4].
