She practised medicine and also trained others in medical work.|$|E

Those communities included the French Reformed Church, Anglican - Episcopalian, Christian and Missionary Alliance, Baptists, Churches of Christ, <b>Worldwide</b> <b>Evangelization</b> <b>Crusade,</b> and Seventh-day Adventists. Other Protestant associations were also represented in some {{social services and}} welfare agencies. In 1967 there were 150,000 Protestant adherents in South Vietnam, representing about 1% of the total population.|$|E

After India and another return to England Charles' missionary work took him alone to Africa and the last sixteen years of their married life was spent apart, with Charles remaining in Africa and Priscilla in England - here she laboured with the newly formed <b>Worldwide</b> <b>Evangelization</b> <b>Crusade.</b> She died in 1929.|$|E
50|$|Brazil for Christ (BPC) {{was founded}} in 1955 {{and was the first}} major Pentecostal church to be founded by a Brazilian. Manoel de Mello began as a preacher in the National <b>Evangelization</b> <b>Crusade,</b> but quickly left it to form his own church after accusations of charlatanism. The BPC quickly became a staple in Sao Paulo {{religious}} life, even getting involved in politics (which most Pentecostal churches at that time left alone). By the 1980s, however, the church's influence had diminished greatly.|$|R
50|$|In June 2000, Verrecchio made {{a formal}} act of consecration to the Blessed Virgin Mary {{as a member}} of the Militia of the Immaculata; the <b>worldwide</b> <b>evangelization</b> {{movement}} founded by St. Maximilian Kolbe - thus the initials M.I. following his name. According to Verrecchio, he uses the initials signifying his consecration to the Virgin Mary in order to give honor to Mary, and to encourage others to investigate Marian consecration as well.|$|R
5000|$|The Militia Immaculatae (meaning the [...] "Army of the Immaculate One"), {{called in}} English the Knights of the Immaculata, is a <b>worldwide</b> Catholic <b>evangelization</b> {{movement}} founded by St. Maximilian Kolbe in 1917.|$|R
5000|$|The Heart of Africa Mission {{was changed}} to <b>Worldwide</b> <b>Evangelization</b> <b>Crusade</b> (WEC) in 1919 when Mr. Gilbert Barclay, who married Studd's {{daughter}} Dorothy, became Home Overseer. He took the position {{on the condition that}} the organization have a worldwide title, scope and work. [...] (As C.T. Studd believed God told him, on his way to Congo, [...] "This journey is not just for Africa but for the whole unevangelised world.") Recruitment of missionaries began immediately and in 1922 WEC entered Amazonia. WEC was the parent organization and individual fields were permitted to retain their own subtitles, so the new field became Heart of Amazonia. By the time of Studd's death, the Amazonia field had 16 missionaries with headquarters and mission stations in three people groups. [...] Central Asia was entered next, then Arabia, followed by West Africa (Spanish Guinea), and then Colombia, South America ...|$|E
5000|$|After Studdâ€™s {{death in}} 1931, it was {{learned that he}} had left a letter {{appointing}} Grubb {{as president of the}} ministry he had founded, World Evangelisation Crusade (W.E.C., WEC International), in place of himself. Grubb however thought {{it would be better to}} be called secretary instead. [...] W.E.C. grew from one mission field with 35 workers to a worldwide mission operating in over 40 fields with thousands of workers from around the world, all living according to the principle that all needs will be supplied by God with no appeals to man. The mission continues to this day under the name of <b>Worldwide</b> <b>Evangelization</b> for Christ.|$|R
50|$|The college {{began as}} a merger of two visions in January 1974. A group of Ghanaian Christians {{had a vision of}} an interdenominational, evangelical {{institution}} of a high academic standard, which would train men and women for all types of Christian Ministry. The second group comprised expatriate missionaries who had a vision of an institution to train workers from the well-established church in southern Ghana for a thrust into northern Ghana and neighboring countries where the church was small. Evangelical Christianity in Ghana in the late 1960s and 1970s was characterized, among other things, by intimate interaction and collaboration and blurring of denominational, mission and group distinctions. The <b>Worldwide</b> <b>Evangelization</b> for Christ (WEC), {{which was one of the}} missionary groups in the second group of missionaries, had acquired property in Kumasi on which they had built four dwelling houses and a radio studio with plans to construct a large building to serve as the beginning of a training college. Soon the two visions merged.|$|R
