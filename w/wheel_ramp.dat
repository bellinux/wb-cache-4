50|$|A {{goods station}} is usually {{equipped}} {{with a large number}} of storage and loading sidings in order to fulfil its task. On the loading sidings there may be fixed facilities, such as cranes or conveyor belts, or temporary equipment, such as <b>wheeled</b> <b>ramps</b> for the loading of sugar beet.|$|R
50|$|When winching, the Hathi {{was fitted}} with chassis-mounted scotches that hinged down {{to hold the}} vehicle in place against the ground. These were {{stronger}} than chocking the wheels, quicker to deploy and also carried the winching forces directly into the chassis, rather than through the suspension. These were an innovation of the production Hathi, the prototype vehicle instead having used a precarious arrangement of <b>wheel</b> <b>ramps</b> that lifted {{the rear of the}} vehicle off the ground.|$|R
50|$|To deploy TOTO, which weighed from 250 to 350 lbs (110-160 kg), two {{men could}} unstrap its mooring cables and roll {{it out of}} the back of a {{customized}} pickup truck in about thirty seconds, using metal <b>wheel</b> <b>ramps.</b> TOTO would then be tipped into a vertical position and swiveled so that a certain side faced north (for accurate wind direction readings). The TOTO crew had to quickly find a relatively level and firm surface, off the road, away from wind obstructions and potential debris generators (such as buildings and trees). With each deployment, there was also a heightened lightning strike risk from handling a large metal object in an open area.|$|R

50|$|The 15 cm schwere Feldhaubitze M 94 {{was a heavy}} {{howitzer}} used by Austria-Hungary in World War I. It had {{a bronze}} barrel and relied on <b>wheel</b> <b>ramps</b> to absorb its recoil. The barrel was modified in 1899 as the M 99 and can be identified by its octagonal shape. Both howitzers could be mounted {{on a wide variety}} of carriages to suit their mission, including a carriage only 1.13 m wide for mountain use. Around the start of the 20th century both the M 94 and M 99 were modified to increase their elevation up to 65Â°. The elevation arc had to be extended and the trunnion mounts and wheels had to be strengthened to withstand the greater recoil forces when firing at high elevation. They were known as the M 94/4 and the M 99/4 after modification.|$|R
5000|$|The channel {{itself is}} also often called a <b>wheeling</b> <b>ramp,</b> push ramp or runnel. There is no {{standard}} in the dimensions, materials, or shape used in the channel, however the channel {{is intended to be}} sufficient to guide a variety of bicycle tires without binding or causing damage. Cross-section shapes vary, but are usually either nearly rectangular or V- or U-shaped. Depth is generally 2 to 6 cm (1 to 2.5 inches) and width 6 to 13 cm (2.5 to 5 inches). If the stairs do not turn and are relatively short, a flat cross section without sidewalls may suffice. The channel is an inclined plane within easy reach of someone using the stairs. There may be level portions for resting or passing. While most examples of existing bicycle stairs feature permanent or built-in channels, Oregon Health & Science University has invested {{in the development of a}} modular, after-market, retrofitting [...] "bicycle gutter" [...] device that was awarded patents in 2011 and 2012.|$|R
40|$|The article {{describes}} in detail {{an arrangement of}} trough-shaped <b>wheel</b> <b>ramps</b> and telescoping articulating control rods intended to allow a wheelchair-bound paraplegic to quickly ascend and descend single steps or curbs as high as 8 in. Data on testing of the system with trained and untrained able-bodied male and female subjects is reported; very limited testing with paraplegics suggests that their performance may almost equal that of the able-bodied. Advantages claimed include simplicity, light weight (8 !b) 'and low cost. Required modification of a standard wheelchair is limited to welding a simple bracket to the outer end of each extended main <b>wheel</b> axle. With <b>ramps</b> and control rods mounted ready for prompt use, chair width is increased {{by a total of}} 6 in. When the chair is used indoors or no curbs are expected, a paraplegic occupant, unaided, can dismount the ramps and rods and store them all in a canvas bag hanging from the seat back. In this configuration the chair is only 1 in wider than its originul unmodified width. Further testing with handicapped occu-pants is intended. Good arm, hand, and lower-back strength and movement, plus good coordination, are user requirements. FIGURE 1. Prototype curb-climbing aid for manual wheel-chairs, ascending a curb on its own ramps.

50|$|The Mohist beliefs {{were outside}} the {{mainstream}} of Chinese thought and culture, but they were tolerated and employed for their utility as siege engineers. They were renowned in the smaller states (and the enemies of the larger states) for the inventions of siege machinery to scale or destroy walls. These included traction trebuchet catapults, eight-foot-high ballistas, a <b>wheeled</b> siege <b>ramp</b> with grappling hooks known as the Cloud Bridge (the protractable, folded ramp slinging forward {{by means of a}} counterweight with rope and pulley), and wheeled 'hook-carts' used to latch large iron hooks onto the tops of walls to pull them down.|$|R

The service is also free if patients have a pensioner Concession care, health care card or a Veteran Affairs Gold card. Victoria DHS.|$|R
5000|$|A major {{thunderstorm}} hits Springfield, and Marge {{demands that}} Homer fix their leaking roof. Homer attempts {{to solve the}} problem by using Hot <b>Wheels</b> <b>ramps</b> to transport all the draining water from the roof to the front yard through the hallway, the stairway and the mail slot on the front door. Though this plan seems to work well, Lisa's hamster slides down the ramps to the front yard by accident. Shocked, Lisa opens the front door to save her hamster, breaking all the ramps, and leaving the house all wet. Marge berates Homer for not providing a more sensible solution to fix the roof. Angered, Homer decides to go to Moe's Tavern, but is kicked out when he sits on Lenny's birthday cake by accident, shaped in the form of Lenny's favourite bar stool. Feeling depressed, Homer finds another bar, [...] "Knockers" [...] (A parody of the restaurant Hooters), where he meets a friendly man named Ray Magini. The two talk, and Homer finds out that Ray is a roofer, so Homer asks him to fix the leak in his roof. Ray agrees. The next day, Homer assures Marge that his new friend will be taking care of the roof. Ray, however, does not arrive until everyone else has left. The two of them get up on the roof and use nail guns to nail the boards onto the roof, but they start shooting nails at each other, some hitting Ned Flanders' lawn mower next door. Ray leaves later and, as Homer runs on the roof, he crashes through the small part of the roof that they fixed, making the hole bigger. Meanwhile, Marge and the kids leave Santa's Little Helper with Grandpa and the Springfield Retirement Home residents, because they seem to like him. When Marge sees the hole, she tells Homer to fix it himself, because she sees {{no reason to believe that}} his friend will.|$|R
50|$|The {{current market}} of buses have {{suspension}} system consisting of either mechanical or air suspension system. Compared to its counterpart, air suspension system has significant benefits. Vehicle height {{can be maintained}} at a particular value irrespective of it load by varying the pressure and also standard coaches have a system called ferry lift. This allows the air suspension to be raised above the normal ride height level to originally aid loading and unloading the vehicle on and off ferries due to their steep ramps and risk of grounding out, but {{can be used on}} rough ground or on steep crests. Although the ferry lift may be installed on some buses, the Kneel Down facility is more common on public transport buses. This helps reduce the step height for easy ingress of passengers.The Kneel Down facility is also used when using the built in <b>wheel</b> chair <b>ramps.</b> Due to several advantages air suspension has been extensively used in commercial vehicles since 1980.|$|R
50|$|Transition pumping {{can only}} be done {{when there is a}} slope {{differential}} between the front and rear <b>wheels.</b> On a <b>ramp</b> it therefore is possible only at {{the top and bottom of}} the slope, but in a pipe it is possible at any height above the flat. The rider should actually push downward on the truck with the greatest slope under the wheels. On the top of a <b>ramp</b> the front <b>wheels</b> should be pushed, and at the bottom the rear trucks should be pushed. On a pipe the weight should be applied to the rear truck throughout the entire transition.|$|R
50|$|Being {{unnecessarily}} elevated above {{road level}} means that each intersection requires a ramp. These are rarely continuous; rolling down from and {{up onto the}} lowered curb lead to discomfort and possible <b>wheel</b> damage. The <b>ramps</b> between buildings and the road are constructed for motorised vehicles not for the pedestrians and cyclists for whom the path is for. This effect is very noticeable even when walking, and more so when guiding a pram or wheelchair or bicycle. At easily attainable speeds, vehicle instability results from being lifted from the saddle through {{the up and down}} motion, requiring the cyclist to travel much more slowly than he/she would on the street running parallel.|$|R
2500|$|In the mid-1930s, the Chicago Great Western Railway {{and then}} the New Haven Railroad began [...] "piggyback" [...] service (transporting highway freight {{trailers}} on flatcars) limited to their own railroads. [...] The Chicago Great Western Railway filed a US federal patent in 1938 on their method of securing each trailer to a flatcar using chains and turnbuckles. [...] Other components included <b>wheel</b> chocks and <b>ramps</b> for loading and unloading the trailers from the flatcars. [...] By 1953, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, the Chicago and Eastern Illinois, and the Southern Pacific railroads had joined the innovation. Most of the railcars used were surplus flatcars equipped with new decks. By 1955, an additional 25 railroads had begun some form of piggyback trailer service.|$|R
5000|$|Ed Leedskalnin and his megalithic creation, Rock Gate, {{better known}} as Coral Castle, {{became a part of}} the American popular culture due to the {{magnitude}} of a single man's effort, perseverance, and determination. With the advent of the Internet, Leedskalnin's fame spread far beyond Florida. Along with the recognition came speculations about his seemingly superhuman powers: either it was his purported access to alien technology or esoteric ancient knowledge, or his assumed ability to levitate blocks of stone and move them with the aid of the Earth's magnetic energy. Other currently available explanations center on Leedskalnin's stonemason and logging experiences that presumably allowed him to apply his work skills creatively to a tedious process of moving large blocks of stone using levers, <b>wheels,</b> axles, pulleys, <b>ramps,</b> and wedges without any power equipment.|$|R
