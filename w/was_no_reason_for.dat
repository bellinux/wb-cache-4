5|$|During the {{formative}} years of women's rights movements, {{the difference between}} the sexes was more or less taken for granted in that their roles, functions, aims and desires were different. As a result, they were not only to be reared differently but treated differently also. Over the course of time, this difference itself became a major reason for initiating women's movements. Early 19th century reformers argued that the difference between men and women <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the subjection of women in society. However, later reformers were of the opinion that indeed it was this particular difference that subjugated women to their roles in society, for example, as mothers. Therefore, there was a need for the proper care of women's rights. With the formation of women's organisations and their own participation in campaigns, their roles as mothers was again stressed but in a different light: this time the argument was for women's rights to speech, education and emancipation. However, the image of women with the mother as a symbol underwent changes over time – from an emphasis on family to the creation of an archetypal mother figure, evoking deep, often atavistic images.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} days before the 2015 Michigan Wolverines {{football}} team began its season for new head coach Jim Harbaugh against Utah, Morris was in a quarterback battle with incoming graduate student transfer Jake Rudock, who had started the prior two seasons for Iowa. On Monday before the Thursday September 3 game, Harbaugh would not name his starter. Rudock started the game. After the second game, against Oregon State, there was controversy when Wilton Speight took the mopup snaps during the 357 victory instead of Morris. Harbaugh explained that since Speight had already used his redshirt season and Morris had not, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> Morris to lose a season unless it was for meaningful snaps, but that Morris is the #2 quarterback. When Rudock was sidelined {{in the third quarter}} with the team trailing in the October 31, 2015, Little Brown Jug rivalry game against Minnesota, Speight engineered the game-winning drive via his first touchdown pass with less than five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. Harbaugh explained that Speight had earned the backup role in practice in the preceding weeks.|$|E

25|$|The {{news was}} greeted with caution, because there was doubt {{as to whether the}} ships were the Channel Fleet or the British convoy. The deputy Spanish commander, José de Mazarredo, called for an {{immediate}} attack. He reasoned that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the British fleet to be sailing so far from the Channel, and argued that all the suspected ships had to be a convoy under escort.|$|E
25|$|On September 7 Stalin {{once again}} {{outlined}} {{a new line}} for the Comintern that was now {{based on the idea}} that the war was an inter-imperialist conflict and hence there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the working class to side with Britain, France, or Poland against Germany, thus departing from the Comintern's anti-fascist popular front policy of 1934–1939. He labeled Poland as a fascist state oppressing Belarusians and Ukrainians.|$|E
25|$|Two {{years before}} the {{beginning}} of World War I, on 4 May 1912, the British magazine Country Life carried a seemingly unremarkable advertisement: the roofing balustrade and urns from the roof of Trentham Hall could be purchased for £200. One of Britain's great ducal country houses, Trentham Hall was demolished with little public comment or interest. It was its owner's property, to do with as he wished. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> public interest or concern; the same magazine had frequently published in-depth articles on new country houses being built, designed by fashionable architects such as Lutyens. As far as general opinion was concerned, England's great houses came and they went; so long as their numbers remained, continuing to provide local employment, the public were not largely concerned. The Country Life advertisement, however, was to prove a hint of things to come.|$|E

25|$|In 1860, Boston {{businessman}} and historian Charles Deane {{was the first}} scholar to question specific details of Smith's writings. Smith's version of events is the only source and skepticism has increasingly been expressed about its veracity. One reason for such doubt is that, despite having published two earlier books about Virginia, Smith's earliest-surviving account of his rescue by Pocahontas dates from 1616, nearly 10 years later, in a letter entreating Queen Anne to treat Pocahontas with dignity. The time gap in publishing his story {{raises the possibility that}} Smith may have exaggerated or invented the event to enhance Pocahontas' image. However, in a recent book, professor Leo Lemay of the University of Delaware points out that Smith's earlier writing was primarily geographical and ethnographic in nature and did not dwell on his personal experiences; hence, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> him to write down the story until this point.|$|E

500|$|The {{ice skating}} scenes were shot {{in an actual}} rink; Carell's talent at hockey was the reason the writers decided to set the episode there. Fischer had also learned to skate in {{preparation}} for the movie Blades of Glory, but the writers decided that there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> Pam to be a good skater, so they had Pam lean on Jim.

The episode opens with a quote from French existentialist philosopher and writer Jean-Paul Sartre—"I am responsible for everything... except my very responsibility", which {{was taken from the}} 1943 treatise Being and Nothingness. Sarte's writing echoes the motivations of the character of Raymond Dees, with author N. E.

The scientists, in particular, chafed under the wartime controls, which were not lifted with the {{surrender}} of Japan. On September 1, 1945, Samuel K. Allison used {{the occasion of the}} announcement of the founding of the Institute for Nuclear Studies to call for freedom to research and develop atomic energy. He told the press that if controls were not removed, nuclear scientists might turn {{to the study of the}} color of butterfly wings. Enrico Fermi warned that [...] "unless research is free and outside of control, the United States will lose its superiority in scientific pursuit".|$|E

500|$|In {{his first}} year of {{operational}} service, Hartmann felt a distinct lack of respect towards Soviet pilots. Most Soviet fighters did not even have proper gunsights, and their pilots were forced to draw one on the windscreen by hand: [...] "In the early days, incredible as it may seem, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> you to feel fear if the Russian fighter was behind you. With their hand-painted gunsights they couldn't pull the lead properly (deflection shooting) or hit you." [...] Hartmann also considered the Bell P-39 Airacobra, the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, and the Hawker Hurricane to be inferior to the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 and Bf109, although they did provide the Soviets with valuable gunsight technology.|$|E
500|$|After {{winning the}} {{previous}} two races of the season which put him into {{the lead of the}} Drivers' Championship, Hamilton said he did not fear a Red Bull resurgence in the following events having declared that the McLaren team was in a good state for {{the second half of the}} season. However, [...] he did not consider himself a favourite to win the championship. Button became concerned that his team would lose its recent momentum but said he would get the maximum amount needed from his car to help him remain in contention. Despite being afflicted with reliability issues with his Red Bull car, Vettel said there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> him or his team to panic and was looking forward to the European Grand Prix in Valencia. Alonso was optimistic that car updates to his Ferrari would allow him to become more competitive but was calm about his expectations.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} {{generally}} well reviewed in biological journals. It received {{a much more}} mixed reaction among sociologists, mainly triggered by the brief coverage {{of the implications of}} sociobiology for human society in the first and last chapters of the book; the body of the text was largely welcomed. A review reached {{the front page of the}} New York Times, such was the level of interest in the debate. The sociologist Gerhard Lenski, admitting that sociologists needed to look further into non-human societies, agreed that human society was founded on biology but denied both biological reductionism and determinism. Lenski observed that since the nature-nurture dichotomy was false, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> sociologists and biologists to disagree. Other sociologists objected in particular to the final chapter, on [...] "Man": Devra G. Kleiman called Wilson's attempt to extend his thesis to humans weak and premature, and noted that he had largely overlooked the importance of co-operative behaviour and females in mammalian societies.|$|E

500|$|Duke Victor Amadeus II of Savoy {{procured}} {{the style}} Royal Highness from Spain and the Holy Roman Empire in June 1689, infuriating Grand Duke Cosimo, who complained to Vienna that a duke was inferior status {{to a grand}} duke, and proclaimed it [...] "unjustly exalted...since the House of Savoy had not increased {{to the point of}} vying with kings, nor had the House of Medici diminished in splendour and possessions, so there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> promoting one and degrading the other." [...] Cosimo also played upon all the times Tuscany provided financial and military assistance to the Empire. The Emperor, anxious to avoid friction, suggested that Anna Maria Luisa should marry the Elector Palatine to compensate for the affront. The Elector Palatine, two years later, several months before his marriage to Anna Maria Luisa, went about acquiring the aforesaid style for Cosimo and his family, {{despite the fact that they}} had no claim to any kingdom. Henceforth, Cosimo was His Royal Highness The Most Serene Grand Duke of Tuscany.|$|E
500|$|As it {{had done}} in 2005, ERT asked 2004 entrant Sakis Rouvas to {{represent}} Greece in the 2006 contest, but he once again denied. In an interview with Down Town magazine Rouvas recalled getting the proposal from the network in [...] "either August or September" [...] and considering it briefly; however, he ultimately found there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> him to go, especially when Greece was the reigning champion, making chances of winning little to none. Nevertheless, ERT still wanted Rouvas involved in some way and they asked him to host the competition, which he accepted. With the news leaked by the newspaper Ethnos, a public announcement was made on 1 November 2005. Rouvas said of his decision, [...] "but when I received the proposal for the hosting of Eurovision I found it intriguing", {{and that it would}} challenge him. American television personality and actress Maria Menounos was eventually announced as his female co-host. The two presented all of the major Eurovision events, including the allocation draw, in addition to the semi-final and final.|$|E
500|$|The {{ice skating}} scenes were shot {{in an actual}} rink.

Saturday Night Live alumna Nancy Walls, who played Carol Stills, is actually Steve Carell's wife. At the rink, Michael tells Pam to be wary of breast cancer. This is the third joke that Stupnitsky and Eisenberg had aimed at Pam's breasts, after one each in [...] "The Fight" [...] and [...] "The Secret". Fischer later jokingly said that [...] "my breasts {{play a central role in}} one of tonight's scenes." [...] Fischer also noted that, due to the slight emphasis her breasts were receiving, many fans on the internet were arguing that Fischer had had breast implants. Fischer denied the rumors, but stated that she was [...] "flattered".|$|E
