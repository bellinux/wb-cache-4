5|$|The SDU on 9M-MRO (the {{aircraft}} {{used for}} Flight370) logged onto the Inmarsat network at midnightMYT. In the 30 minutes prior to take-off, seventeen messages <b>were</b> <b>exchanged</b> between the SDU and the Inmarsat network. An additional three messages <b>were</b> <b>exchanged</b> between take-off {{and the time}} Flight370 disappeared from secondary radar. The final message to use the ACARS protocol was sent at 01:07; ACARS reports expected at 01:37 and 02:07 were not received. At 02:03 and 2:05, messages from the ground station went unanswered, indicating that the link was lost at some point between 1:07 and 2:03.|$|E
5|$|Next, Tomohiro Ishii {{defended the}} NEVER Openweight Championship against Togi Makabe. Clotheslines, forearms, {{shoulder}} blocks, slaps, headbutts, sledgehammers, powerslams, powerbombs, and German suplexes <b>were</b> <b>exchanged.</b> Makabe won the match (and the title) with a running lariat and the King Kong Knee Drop {{from the top}} rope, followed by a pinfall at 12 minutes and 23 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The Great North {{had opened}} using {{a system of}} telegraphic train orders, and as the {{signalling}} was being upgraded this was being replaced with electric tablet working over the single line sections. Now express trains had to slow to exchange tokens {{in a process that}} frequently left railwaymen injured, so James Manson, the locomotive superintendent, designed an automatic token exchange system based on apparatus used to move cotton in a factory. At first tokens <b>were</b> <b>exchanged</b> at , but soon they <b>were</b> <b>exchanged</b> at line speed. After trialling on the Fraserburgh line, the system was installed on the coast route in May 1889, and by 1 January 1893 it was in operation on all single-line sections.|$|E

5|$|In 1894, the {{lighthouse}} was further altered {{to increase the}} amount of light emitted. The four-wick burner and mirrors <b>were</b> <b>exchanged</b> for a Douglass burner with eight wicks and an improved lantern; the power of the light was increased to 35,000 candela. The characteristic of the light changed from fixed to occulting. A foghorn was also installed, with two quick blasts every five minutes. The eight-wick burner was exchanged for a three incandescent mantle burner in 1905. In 1923, the burner was replaced by a Hood petroleum vapour burner with one mantle.|$|E
5|$|In early 1945, the German {{war effort}} {{was on the}} verge of {{collapse}} and Himmler's relationship with Hitler had deteriorated. Himmler considered independently negotiating a peace settlement. His masseur, Felix Kersten, who had moved to Sweden, acted as an intermediary in negotiations with Count Folke Bernadotte, head of the Swedish Red Cross. Letters <b>were</b> <b>exchanged</b> between the two men, and direct meetings were arranged by Walter Schellenberg of the RSHA.|$|E
5|$|On 7 October 2000, three Israeli {{soldiers}} – Adi Avitan, Staff Sgt. Benyamin Avraham, and Staff Sgt. Omar Sawaidwere – were {{abducted by}} Hezbollah while patrolling the Israeli {{side of the}} Israeli-Lebanese border. The soldiers were killed either during the attack or in its immediate aftermath. Israel Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz has, however, said that Hezbollah abducted the soldiers and then killed them. The bodies of the slain soldiers <b>were</b> <b>exchanged</b> for Lebanese prisoners in 2004.|$|E

Williams' popularity was riding at 75%, and polls during the campaign showed the Conservatives reaching up to 86 percent of voter support.|$|E
5|$|The {{originally}} intended 12-pounder guns <b>were</b> <b>exchanged</b> for sixteen 4-in (102mm) QF Mk III guns {{early in the}} construction process. They were positioned in the superstructure and on turret roofs in open mounts as they were {{not expected to be}} manned in a ship-to-ship engagement during daylight. During 1914–15 the turret roof guns were transferred to the superstructure and the total number of guns was reduced to twelve. All of the remaining guns were enclosed in casemates and given blast shields at that time to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action.|$|E
5|$|While {{the highway}} itself is largely {{unchanged}} since 1919, the connections with other trunklines have changed. The intersection {{south of the}} community of Chatham where M-67 has ended since designation has remained unchanged. The other highways running through the intersection have changed twice. The first highway to connect with M-67 was M-25. M-25 was replaced by M-28 in 1926. The second change came in 1941 when the routings of M-28 and M-94 <b>were</b> <b>exchanged</b> between Harvey and Munising.|$|E

One prize exchange may serve a number of nearby parlors, getting a percentage of the prize's value when it is collected by the parlor.|$|R
5|$|Before {{setting off}} for Paris, Carrouges first visited Argentan {{to meet with}} Count Pierre and there announcing his {{intention}} of continuing to the capital. What followed was a sequence of events which will forever remain unclear but which would have a dramatic effect {{on the lives of}} all concerned. What is certain is that Carrouges encountered his rival Jacques Le Gris at the court of Count Pierre and words <b>were</b> <b>exchanged,</b> although what was said is unknown. In contrast to his bankrupt rival, Le Gris had not been on the Scottish expedition and had grown wealthier in Carrouges' absence. Le Gris also had a reputation as a fierce and strong soldier in addition to that of a notorious womaniser, a reputation that may have played a part in the allegations which followed.|$|E
5|$|Following Jones' rejection, Garrard vetoed a {{bill that}} would have allowed the {{legislature}} to select the state's presidential and vice-presidential electors; despite the fact that the law ran contrary to the state constitution, Garrard's veto further strained his relations with the Senate. After the Senate rejected nominee William Trigg, the state's newspapers openly talked of an executive-legislative feud and claimed the Senate had its own favorite candidate for the position and would not accept anyone else. When the Senate rejected Willis Green in January 1804, Garrard declared that he would make no more nominations for the position. Accusations of bad faith <b>were</b> <b>exchanged</b> between the governor and the Senate, after which Garrard nominated John Adair, the popular Speaker of the House. The Senate finally confirmed this choice.|$|E
5|$|In May 1861, Melvin {{served as}} a {{delegate}} to the First Wheeling Convention. At {{the start of the}} American Civil War, Melvin enlisted as a private in CompanyF of the 1st West Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment of the Union Army. In August of that year, he organized a company of men in Hancock County. Melvin was later commissioned as Adjutant general of Volunteers on the staff of Brigadier General Benjamin Franklin Kelley in the Department of West Virginia. On February 21, 1865, Melvin was captured in Cumberland, Maryland, along with General Kelley and Major General George Crook, by the Confederate partisans, McNeill's Rangers. Melvin, Kelley, and Crook were taken to Richmond where they <b>were</b> <b>exchanged</b> for Confederate general Isaac R. Trimble.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, {{at about}} 11:00 am, 16 tanks, 2 armored {{personnel}} carriers and 30 cars had been sent from the Officer School of Armored and Mechanized Formations, a Poznań garrison, to protect the designated buildings, but no shots <b>were</b> <b>exchanged</b> {{between them and the}} insurgents. These soldiers engaged in friendly conversation with the protesters; some reports state that two tanks were seized and some troops disarmed. Then the Soviet General Konstantin Rokossovsky, the Minister of National Defense, who was then in command of all armed forces in Poland, decided to take personal control, and the situation changed dramatically.|$|E
5|$|Lejoille's {{published}} {{account of}} the action greatly exaggerated the scale of his success, and, although he was highly praised in the French press, he was castigated in Britain for his conduct. Thompson, Berry {{and most of the}} British officers <b>were</b> <b>exchanged</b> and acquitted at court martial, and the captains were knighted for their services, while Leander and many of the crew were recaptured in March 1799 by a Russian squadron that seized Corfu, and returned to British control by order of Tsar Paul. Généreux survived another year in the Mediterranean, but was eventually captured off Malta in 1800 by a British squadron under Lord Nelson.|$|E
5|$|On 11 June she was {{commissioned}} by the RCN and renamed Restigouche, although her refit was not completed until 20 August. Restigouche {{was assigned to the}} Canadian Pacific Coast and arrived at Esquimalt on 7 November 1938. She remained there until she was ordered to Halifax, Nova Scotia on 15 November 1939 where she escorted local convoys, including the convoy carrying half of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division to the UK on 10 December. Restigouche was ordered to Plymouth on 24 May 1940 and arrived there on 31 May. Upon arrival, the ship's rear torpedo tube mount was removed and replaced by a 12-pounder AA gun and the 2-pounders <b>were</b> <b>exchanged</b> for quadruple Mark I mounts for the QF 0.5-inch Vickers Mark III machine gun.|$|E

5|$|On September 27, 1989, the Phillies {{faced the}} Mets {{in their home}} finale at Shea Stadium in New York after a disappointing Mets season. The Mets had won the East in 1988 but were in third place on September 26 behind the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals. McDowell was closing out a 5–3 win for the Phillies when, with two outs in the ninth, he induced former {{teammate}} Gregg Jeffries to ground out to second to end the game. As Jeffries was running out the play, McDowell said something to him prompting Jeffries to charge the mound and wrestle McDowell to the ground. The benches cleared and punches <b>were</b> <b>exchanged</b> before the umpires could separate the teams. Jeffries later claimed that McDowell had thrown at him during a 2–1 Phillies victory on September 25.|$|E
5|$|One of the Prussian playing-for-time {{requests}} to the Patriotic Party was {{that before the}} treaty is signed, {{they need to see}} more reforms within the Commonwealth government. In October 1789, the changing international situation (primarily the military defeats of the Ottoman Empire) suddenly and temporarily increased the value of an alliance with Poland for Prussia. In the meantime, the previously anti-royalist Patriotic Party has begun drifting closer to the king. In February and March 1790, concrete proposals <b>were</b> <b>exchanged</b> between Warsaw and Berlin. Some difficulties were centered around Prussian demands for the cession of Gdańsk and Toruń, and tariffs, but a threat of a Polish-Austrian alliance, recently brought forward by Austria, caused Prussia to withdraw most of the demands the Polish side was finding difficult to accept.|$|E
5|$|Ossetian separatists began intensively {{shelling}} Georgian villages on 1 August, with a sporadic {{response from}} Georgian peacekeepers and other {{troops in the}} region.

According to the OSCE mission, the incident was the worst outbreak of violence since 2004. On 2–3 and again on 3–4 August, firing recommenced during the night. A 1992 ceasefire agreement was breached by Ossetian artillery attacks.|$|E
