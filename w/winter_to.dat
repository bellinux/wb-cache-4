5|$|Banksia ilicifolia {{has been}} {{recorded}} {{as a source of}} nectar for the honey possum (Tarsipes rostratus) in <b>winter</b> <b>to</b> early summer (May to December), from field studies in the Scott National Park, replaced by Adenanthos meisneri in the summer. Several honeyeater species visit and pollinate Banksia ilicifolia. The western spinebill (Acanthorhynchus superciliosus) in particular prefers this species over other banksias.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} sundews are self-fertile; their flowers will often self-pollinate upon closing. Often, {{numerous}} seeds are produced. The tiny black seeds germinate {{in response to}} moisture and light, while seeds of temperate species also require cold, damp, stratification to germinate. Seeds of the tuberous species require a hot, dry summer period followed by a cool, moist <b>winter</b> <b>to</b> germinate.|$|E

5|$|This {{species is}} saprobic, and is found growing in {{groups on the}} ground or on moss-covered {{decaying}} wood, especially amongst fallen pine needles. In North America, fruit bodies appear in the spring and summer, and are fairly common; in Britain, the fungus fruits from <b>winter</b> <b>to</b> spring, and is rare.

5|$|A small prickly leaved shrub between 0.2 and 3m (8 in to 10ft) high, G. juniperina grows {{generally}} on clay-based or alluvial soils in eucalypt woodland. The flower heads, {{known as}} inflorescences, appear from <b>winter</b> <b>to</b> early summer and are red, orange or yellow. Birds visit and pollinate the flowers. Grevillea juniperina plants {{are killed by}} bushfire, regenerating afterwards from seed. Grevillea juniperina adapts readily to cultivation and has been important in horticulture {{as it is the}} parent of many popular garden hybrids.|$|E
5|$|Blackcurrants {{can grow}} well on sandy or heavy loams, or forest soils, {{as long as}} their {{nutrient}} requirements are met. They prefer damp, fertile but not waterlogged ground and are intolerant of drought. Although the bushes are winter hardy, frosts during the flowering period may adversely affect the yield and cold winds may restrict the number of flying insects visiting and pollinating the flowers. A pH of about 6 is ideal for blackcurrants and the ground can be limed if the soil is too acidic. Planting is usually done in the autumn or <b>winter</b> <b>to</b> allow the plants to become established before growth starts in the spring, but container-grown stock can be planted at any time of year.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} {{surrender}} of Nazi Germany on May 8, 1945, plans were underway for the largest operation of the Pacific War, Operation Downfall, the invasion of Japan. The operation had two parts: Operation Olympic and Operation Coronet. Set to begin in October 1945, Olympic involved a series of landings by the U.S. Sixth Army intended to capture the southern third of the southernmost main Japanese island, Kyūshū. Operation Olympic was to be followed in March 1946 by Operation Coronet, the capture of the Kantō Plain, near Tokyo on the main Japanese island of Honshū by the U.S. First, Eighth and Tenth Armies, {{as well as a}} Commonwealth Corps made up of Australian, British and Canadian divisions. The target date was chosen to allow for Olympic to complete its objectives, for troops to be redeployed from Europe, and the Japanese <b>winter</b> <b>to</b> pass.|$|E

5|$|Floral buds are {{produced}} year-round on {{the tips of}} new growth, but only those initiated between November and May go on to flower several months later. Flowering usually takes place from July to November (late <b>winter</b> <b>to</b> early summer) in the golden wattle's native range; because the later buds develop faster, flowering peaks over July and August. The bright yellow inflorescences occur in groups of 40 to 80 on -long racemes that arise from axillary buds. Each inflorescence is a ball-like structure that is covered by 40 to 100 small flowers that have five tiny petals (pentamerous) and long erect stamens, which give the flower head a fluffy appearance.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the 1928–29 tour, Chapman did {{not return}} to England until July, midway through the cricket season; Jack White and Arthur Carr captained England in his absence. Chapman resumed playing for Kent shortly after his return home but {{appeared}} in only seven matches, with a top-score of 28. His season was curtailed when he fell awkwardly while fielding in a match against Sussex at the beginning of August. He also missed the two MCC tours that <b>winter</b> <b>to</b> New Zealand and West Indies, neither of which involved a full-strength team.|$|E
5|$|Geastrum triplex is a {{saprobic}} fungus: it derives {{nutrients from}} decomposing organic matter. The fruit bodies are usually found growing singly or more commonly in groups in hardwood forests where much humus has accumulated; in Mexico, {{they have been}} collected in tropical deciduous forest. Fruit bodies are often found around well-rotted tree stumps; they are initially almost buried in the loose duff, but emerge during maturity as the downward curling of the rays exposes the spore sac. Old fruit bodies are persistent, and may survive the <b>winter</b> <b>to</b> be found the following spring or summer. A Dutch study reported a propensity for G.triplex to grow on soil made calcium-rich from washed-out chalk of crushed shells on bicycling paths. It is described as common in North America and Europe. One author states it is commonly found under beech trees.|$|E

5|$|Grant {{continued}} his coaching {{success in the}} NFL as he took over from original coach, Norm Van Brocklin. Over his tenure as Vikings head coach, Grant was known for instilling discipline in his teams and displaying a lack of emotion during games. He believed that football is a game of controlled emotion and teams would not follow the coach's lead {{if he were to}} panic or lose his poise {{during the course of a}} game. He required his team to stand at attention in a straight line during the entire national anthem played before the game and even had national anthem practice. Grant required outdoor practice during the <b>winter</b> <b>to</b> get players used to the cold weather and would not allow heaters on the sidelines during games.|$|E
5|$|Having first {{inhabited}} Pennsylvania between 16,000 and 10,000 BCE, nomadic Native Americans {{reached the}} {{area near the}} mouth of Fishing Creek by 8000 BCE. By 3000 to 2000 BCE, some of them were going into the Fishing Creek valley during the <b>winter</b> <b>to</b> hunt deer and bears and returning to the Susquehanna River in the summer, creating trade routes. There was no permanent habitation until 1000 BCE when some Native American villages were built at the mouth of Fishing Creek. The Native Americans who settled in this area included the Shawnee and Susquehannock Indians. A Native American path ran along the creek from Bloomsburg to Orangeville before turning away in the direction of Tunkhannock Creek. Since at least 1769, there has also been a path between the mouths of Huntington and Green Creeks.|$|E
5|$|In 1762, missionaries {{established}} two unauthorized missions {{south of}} San Sabá, in the Nueces River valley. For several years the Apache {{lived in the}} missions most of the year, but left in <b>winter</b> <b>to</b> hunt buffalo. One of the missions closed in 1763, when the Apache never returned from their hunt. The surviving mission closed in January 1766, after a force of 400natives from the northern tribes attacked, killing 6Apaches and taking 25captives {{as well as all}} the livestock in the valley. Forty-one Spanish troops and their small cannon ambushed the northern tribes as they returned to East Texas. Before the Spanish were forced to retreat, over 200Indians and 12Spanish soldiers died. After the battle, the Apache refused to return to the mission and returned to raiding near San Antonio. Raids by the northern tribes decreased, however.|$|E

5|$|Seabird colonies {{are highly}} variable. Individual nesting sites can be widely spaced, as in an {{albatross}} colony, or densely packed {{as with a}} murre colony. In most seabird colonies, several different species will nest on the same colony, often exhibiting some niche separation. Seabirds can nest in trees (if any are available), on the ground (with or without nests), on cliffs, in burrows under the ground and in rocky crevices. Competition can be strong both within species and between species, with aggressive species such as sooty terns pushing less dominant species out of the most desirable nesting spaces.

5|$|Several governments {{maintain}} permanent manned research stations on the continent. The {{number of}} people conducting and supporting scientific research and other work on the continent and its nearby islands varies from about 1,000 in <b>winter</b> <b>to</b> about 5,000 in the summer, giving it a population density between 70 and 350 inhabitants per million square kilometres (180 and 900 per million square miles) at these times. Many of the stations are staffed year-round, the winter-over personnel typically arriving from their home countries for a one-year assignment. An Orthodox church—Trinity Church, opened in 2004 at the Russian Bellingshausen Station—is manned year-round by one or two priests, who are similarly rotated every year.|$|E
