25|$|In 1893, {{before the}} {{establishment}} of a modern automotive industry in Britain, English engineer Bramah Joseph Diplock patented a four-wheel-drive system for a steam-powered traction engine, including four-wheel steering and three differentials, which was subsequently built. The development also incorporated Bramah's Pedrail <b>wheel</b> <b>system</b> in what {{was one of the first}} four-wheel-drive automobiles to display an intentional ability to travel on challenging road surfaces. It stemmed from Bramagh's previous idea of developing an engine that would reduce the amount of damage to public roads.|$|E
25|$|Following Dadford's demise, Benjamin Outram was {{consulted}} on {{a number}} of matters, and recommended that the railways should be converted from edge rails to tram plates. Many of them were converted in this way, but this alteration was not always successful, with users of the Crumlin Bridge to Beaufort Ironworks tramway complaining in 1802 that they had incurred considerable cost to make the transition, only to find that the new tramway was unusable due to poor construction. In 1806, the loaded weights of wagons were reduced, in an attempt {{to reduce the number of}} broken tramplates. Ultimately, many of the tramways were converted to standard gauge railways, and so reverted to the flanged <b>wheel</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

Training of {{appropriate}} wheelchair propulsion methods {{may be beneficial}} to the individual who uses a wheelchair by reducing the incidence of pain and improving one's quality of life. This paper discusses th e development and initial testing of a training device that was developed to aid in wheelchair propulsion techniques: GAME <b>Wheels</b> <b>System.</b> Methods. Two separate models of GAME Wheels have been developed: a GAME Wheels Clinical and a GAME Wheels Trainer. Details of the development process and the refinement {{have been included in}} this manuscript. To verify and compare the practicality and functionality of the two GAME <b>Wheels</b> <b>systems,</b> several focus groups were conducted: first to determine whether the systems could be set-up with informational materials and second to determine if the systems could be taught to novice users. Results. Results from the focus group indicate that the overall impressions of the systems were that they were fun to play. Suggestions were raised to improve the design, which have been incorporated into further refinement of the GAME <b>Wheels</b> <b>systems.</b> Conclusions. This paper provides an overview of the development of a wheelchair-training device.

40|$|For {{individuals}} with a spinal cord injury or dysfunction (SCI/D), opportunities to exercise are limited and are usually not highly motivating experiences. Exercise programs or extracurricular activities may help increase or maintain the cardiovascular fitness level of {{individuals with}} SCI/D. The GAME <b>Wheels</b> <b>system,</b> an interface between a portable roller system and a computer, enables an individual to control a video game by propelling his or her wheelchair. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate whether the propulsive forces used during video play, both with and without the GAME <b>Wheels</b> <b>system,</b> were different. A secondary purpose was to examine differences in metabolic parameters during exercise under these two conditions. Ten manual wheelchair users exercised on the GAME <b>Wheels</b> <b>system</b> with and without controlling a video game. Physiological and kinetic data were collected six times during two exercise trials. Kinetic data were recorded with the SMART Wheel and used to investigate propulsion forces. No significant differences were found in the resultant force, rate of rise, or number of hand contacts with the pushrims. This study showed that propulsion pattern did not change significantly when wheelchair users exercised while playing a computer video game. Oxygen consumption, ventilation, and heart rate were significantly different (p < 0. 05) between the two groups during the last three exercise intervals and cooldown. Playing a video game while exercising may help to motivate manual wheelchair users to exercise longer and regularly, something that was reported by this study's subjects; likewise, exercising while playing a video game may not be associated with higher pushrim forces and stroke frequencies...|$|R
