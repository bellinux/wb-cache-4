Cuneiform tablets were constantly moving around the ancient Near East, offering alliances (sometimes including daughters for marriage), threatening war, acting as shipping documents for mundane supplies or settling accounts receivable. Most were tossed away after use the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> would discard unwanted receipts. Fortunately for us, tablets are durable and many are well-preserved even when used as material for wall filler in new construction.|$|E

I am not a cheat and never have been. It was an instinctive reaction to a ball that was coming extremely fast in a crowded penalty area....As a footballer you do not have the luxury of the television to slow the pace of the ball down 100 times {{to be able to make}} a conscious decision...People are viewing a slow motion version of what happened and not what I or any other footballer faces in the game. If people look at it in full speed you will see that it was an instinctive reaction.|$|E

500|$|The soundtrack started being {{composed}} before production {{had even}} begun, {{and is a}} notable departure from the band's previous works, as Daft Punk put more emphasis on orchestral elements rather than relying solely on synthesizers. [...] "Synths are a very low level of artificial intelligence," [...] explained member Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, [...] "whereas you have a Stradivarius that will live for a thousand years.

Reznor later described Year Zero as [...] "the soundtrack to a movie that doesn't exist". The album criticizes the American government's policies, and [...] "could be {{about the end of}} the world". [...] Reznor specifically cited what he labeled as the [...] "erosion of freedoms" [...] and [...] "the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> treat the rest of the world and our own citizens".

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{it is argued}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should amend the {{traditional}} understanding of the view known as the guise of the good. The guise of the good is traditionally understood as the view <b>that</b> <b>we</b> only want to act in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> believe to be good in some way. But {{it is argued that}} a more plausible view is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> only want to act in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> believe we have normative reason to act in. This change – from formulating the view in terms of goodness to formulating it in terms of reasons – is significant because the revised view avoids various old and new counterexamples to the traditional view, because the revised view is better motivated than the traditional view, and because the revised view is better placed to explain certain features of desire than the traditional view. The paper finishes by showing that the conclusions reached are compatible with theories such as the buck passing account of value...|$|R
500|$|The {{producers}} considered screening {{the first}} part of the season premiere at Comic-Con in San Diego, but ultimately decided against it because they thought the scene [...] "ends in such an exciting <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were afraid to let it out". As a promotion, Fox did send out a DVD [...] "screener" [...] package of the premiere to certain journalists, which included a copy of the New York Times article shown in the first season finale as well as a piece of paper with a list of typed phrases. The paper was a copy of the instructions one of the shapeshifters received on the typewriter, which included phrases like [...] "Mission Accomplished" [...] and [...] "Target Terminated".|$|E

Samutsevich said in December 2012 that [...] "more than anything, what many people didn't see during the trial were those moments when our 'right to defence' was violated. It's not that we were helpless, it was a situation of despair." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, she continued: [...] "The trial was built in such a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> couldn't defend ourselves. They didn't listen to us.

500|$|Folk metal {{has been}} {{associated}} with paganism ever since its inception, when Martin Walkyier left his former band Sabbat to form Skyclad, in part because the band [...] "wasn't going to go far enough down the pagan, British <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> wanted to do it." [...] Consequently, the lyrics of Skyclad have been known to deal with pagan matters. The band Cruachan was also founded by a self-described pagan, Keith Fay. For Ville Sorvali of Moonsorrow, the label [...] "pagan metal" [...] is preferred [...] "because that describes the ideological points in the music, but doesn’t say anything about the music itself." [...] Other bands that also prefer to use the term [...] "pagan metal" [...] as a self-description include Cruachan, Eluveitie, Obtest and Skyforger. In contrast to bands with pagan themes, some folk metal bands such as Orphaned Land have themes of Abrahamic religion.|$|E

[...] Nolan said Valentine took control of [...] "the amp stuff," [...] which made sense to him [...] "because he knows so much more about that stuff". The group spent some time [...] "messing around" [...] with guitar pedals, according to Nolan. On December 8, the band posted a behind-the-scenes video of themselves in the studio. On January 10, 2011, the band announced that recording was officially completed. A week later, the band said the album's artwork was being produced and Valentine was mixing the tracks. While 11 tracks ended up on the final version of the album, a further seven or eight songs were recorded. Howie Weinberg mastered the recordings at Howie Weinberg Mastering in March.|$|E

Futterman praised their departure from the bar as a [...] "very faithful and honest scene". Crystal Bell of HuffPost TV was impressed by the way the characters' relationship [...] "inspires gay youth in a <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> haven't seen on network television yet" [...] and called them [...] "amazing role models for all teens", and The Atlantic writer Kevin Fallon said it was [...] "remarkable" [...] and a [...] "milestone" [...] that [...] "the decision by gay teen characters to lose their virginities is given equal weight to that of a straight couple".|$|E

On May 11, 2012, NBC renewed The Office for a ninth season. Series developer Greg Daniels returned as showrunner this season. Daniels stated that the season would feature more big season arcs, saying [...] "I'll tell you that the last couple of years, I don't think we did any big arc-type things in the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> used to in the beginning, I think the thing we're going to do is bring back a lot of arcs."

To Bewick, nature was the source of joy, challenge and perpetual consolation. In his woodcuts of birds and animals as well as his brilliant tail-pieces, we can still feel this today." [...] However, in her biography of Bewick, she adds that [...] "The country might be beautiful but it also stank: in his vignettes men relieve themselves in hedges and ruins, a woman holds her nose as she walks between the cowpats, and a farmyard privy shows that men are as filthy as the pigs they despise." ...|$|E

500|$|On February 5, 2009, Krysten Ritter {{became the}} first guest star to be officially cast for the Valley Girls pilot. Brittany Snow was the {{producers}}' top choice for young Lily Rhodes and was offered the role in early February 2009 without auditioning. Initially, the series' producers wanted to cast an undiscovered star in the role while Snow was interested in continuing her film career. However, after viewing a reel featuring Snow's work ranging from Hairspray to Nip/Tuck, Savage and Schwartz found her [...] "perfect" [...] and [...] "pulled out all the stops" [...] to convince {{her to come back}} to TV. Ryan Hansen had previously starred as [...] "Douche" [...] on Schwartz's web series Rockville CA. Schwartz deemed Hansen's performance there [...] "so unlikable in such a likable <b>way,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> cast him on the Gossip Girl spin-off."

500|$|The {{album was}} titled after the {{recurring}} theme {{of water in}} songs such as [...] "Diving for Hearts" [...] and [...] "I Would Like to Call It Beauty", while the music was said by Rae to possess [...] "a kind of tidal movement to it too, in the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> recorded the songs. You know, sometimes {{it would just be}} me and my guitar. Then we'd really sort of swell up into these big arrangements, only to then retreat back to it just being me and my guitar again." [...] According to Chris Mugan from The Independent, The Sea was a departure from the polished sound of Rae's debut album, while Paste magazine's Steve Labate said Rae expanded on her debut's mix of contemporary R and older soul music by incorporating pop rock, singer-songwriter influences, and occasional elements of bossa nova and trip hop. In the opinion of Craig McLean from The Daily Telegraph, the record's music evoked Simone's singing and the 1968 Van Morrison album Astral Weeks.|$|E
