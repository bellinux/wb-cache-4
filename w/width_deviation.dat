40|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient approach to measure sharpness mismatches between stereoscopic views. Sharpness mismatch can occur through focus mismatches between stereoscopic cameras, errors in post-processing {{or even for}} low-bandwidth transmission, where one view is subsampled or transmitted {{at a much lower}} rate. This artifact can lead to a degraded 3 D experience for observers. In this paper, the sharpness mismatch score is estimated by measuring the <b>width</b> <b>deviations</b> of edge pairs in each valid depth plane. The mismatch probability is then calculated considering the perceptibility of edge <b>width</b> <b>deviations.</b> In the experiments, Gaussian low-pass filters were used to generate global sharpness mismatches between stereoscopic views since defocus-based effects of lens aberrations can be modeled as Gaussian blur. Thus, the global sharpness distortions simulate the focus mismatch of stereo cameras. The disparity maps of test videos were automatically generated and corrected. In addition, original high-quality disparity maps of the test datasets were used as benchmarks. According to the experimental results, we show that the proposed approach performs well on measuring sharpness mismatch between stereoscopic views by comparison with some state-of-the-art metrics...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} sharpness {{mismatch between}} stereoscopic views. Sharpness mismatch {{is a special}} binocular mismatch and can occur through e. g. focus mismatch between stereoscopic cameras, errors in post-processing or asymmetric coding for low-bandwidth transmission, where one view is subsampled or transmitted {{at a much lower}} rate. Although blurred edges in one view can be suppressed by the corresponding sharper edges in the other view according to the binocular suppression phenomenon, sharpness mismatch can still be perceived and cause eye strain for viewers. Subjective studies were carried out with a test video dataset, in which the stereoscopic views are asymmetrically blurred by Gaussian low-pass filters since defocus-based effects of lens aberrations can be modeled as Gaussian blur. Also, an efficient novel automatic no-reference approach to measure the probability of sharpness mismatch is presented in this paper. The sharpness mismatch score is estimated by measuring <b>width</b> <b>deviations</b> of edge pairs in each “edge-significant” depth plane based on depth edges in both views. The probability of sharpness mismatch (PSM) is then calculated considering the perceptibility of edge <b>width</b> <b>deviations</b> considering absolute depth at which the edges occur. This PSM metric is evaluated using the test video dataset and blurriness dataset of LIVE 3 D Phase II database. The experimental results show that the proposed metric outperforms the state-of-the-art stereo 3 D quality metrics on analyzing sharpness mismatch between stereoscopic views...|$|R

Laser microgrooving is based on the interaction of a laser beam with the workpiece surface, non-uniform melting and ejection of material from the groove walls, and laser power reduction, as the beam propagates into the groove, can be identified as a cause for the variation in lower width and depth formation which is of prime importance to enhance the product quality. With the intention of achieving good-quality microgroove machined surface and better dimensional accuracy on alumina ceramic workpiece, intensive research is needed. Also, an extensive research work is much needed to develop a technology guidance for laser microgrooving of such a useful material for modern manufacturing industries. Moreover, appropriate combination and utilization, along with proper adjustment of pre-cited machining parameters, are of prime importance for acquiring good grade of microgroove, which is a challenging task as it consumes precious time and effort due to the dynamic behavior of the laser micromachining process. Yet almost no systematic study has been reported in laser microgrooving operation that would ensure scope for researchers, and also no method currently results in the same level of efficiency for all processes. The novelty aspect of the present study focuses on the development of computational as well as empirical models and multi-response parametric optimization in microgrooving of alumina (Al 2 O 3) ceramic material through Nd:YAG laser treatment. Particularly, design of experiments (DOEs), response surface methodology (RSM), artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA) have been applied to process improvement. The following dimensional deviations of the microgroove are addressed: upper <b>width</b> <b>deviation,</b> lower <b>width</b> <b>deviation</b> and depth deviation. The manuscript is arranged in the following form: “Introduction” section contains a brief overview of the motivation of the problem and shows the updated progress. “Experimental setup and procedure” section provides {{a brief description of the}} experimentation process, the material and the methods involved. “Results and discussion” section critically discusses the results obtained. The statistical analysis of the experiments and formation of the mathematical model are covered in section “Results and discussion.” This section also highlights the use of ANN and GA as a suitable optimization technique for the current problem.

40|$|Wave {{data are}} {{required}} in many engineering applications. At locations where measured records {{are not available}} or are too short for design purposes, estimates of wave properties from numerical wave models are often used to characterise the expected wave climate. Typically, model predictions are validated against observations of the sea-state parameters, such as significant wave height, peak wave period, mean wave period and mean wave direction. However, while agreement between observed and predicted sea-state parameters can be good, {{in some cases the}} measured and predicted wave spectra can diverge significantly. In these circumstances, simple sea state parameters alone are not sufficient to describe the range of wave conditions that could arise at a given site. In this paper we present a new, alternative approach for assessing wave model performance by applying new parameterisation to the frequency wave spectrum. Seven parameters (significant wave height, peak frequency, peak energy density, squared Euclidean distance, skewness, kurtosis and mean <b>width</b> <b>deviation)</b> are used to better define the characteristics of unimodal wave spectra. Sensitivity tests are undertaken to analyse the performance and sensitivity of these parameters in identifying differences between observed and predicted wave spectra, using a range of idealised JONSWAP wave spectra. We demonstrate that comparing multiple parameters is a better method to distinguish differences between spectra than the results obtained using individual parameters in isolation. As such, application of two-dimensional validation matrices are proposed to provide a better, qualitative overview of the goodness of fit between observed and predicted wave spectra. The advantages of the new approach are demonstrated through validation of a hindcast spectral wave model at Hastings, southeast England. We believe that we have achieved our purpose here to start a discussion on alternative validation techniques that could be enhanced in the future...|$|E
40|$|Spectral wave {{data are}} {{required}} in many engineering {{applications such as}} the design of coastal defence and offshore platforms. As such, numerical wave models {{have been developed to}} estimate these wave data at locations where observed records are not available. In the published literature, the model results are often validated using sea-state parameters like significant wave height, peak wave period, mean wave period and mean wave direction. However, in some cases these parameters are not sufficient to describe the entire wave spectrum. In theory, the sea-state values could have a good agreement while the wave spectrums diverge from each other. Therefore, the main aim of this research work is to develop a new, robust approach for validating wave models by applying new parameterisation to the frequency wave spectrum. A series of parameters from wave mechanics and other disciplines have been reviewed to better define wave spectrums. These parameters are tested over a range of JONSWAP wave spectrum idealized scenarios to analyse their sensitivity and performance. The result shows that a family of seven parameters including significant wave height, peak frequency, peak energy density, squared Euclidean distance, skewness, kurtosis and mean <b>width</b> <b>deviation</b> are required to best describe the characteristic differences between an observed and predicted spectrum. Parallel analysis of the parameters reveals more qualitative information about the two spectrums, in contrast to the individual assessment of each parameter. The feasibility of the new approach developed here has been proven through the validation of a hindcast spectral wave model at three nearshore sites around the UK. The result shows that the model performance varies in both the temporal and spatial domains. Two-dimensional validation matrices have also been applied to illustrate the relationship between the various parameters with the relative magnitude, shape and position of the wave spectrums...|$|E

The ternary thiol-yne-(meth) acrylate systems were evaluated for their potential to achieve simultaneously outstanding Tg and modulus and low shrinkage stress. The crosslinking density and the amount of volumetric shrinkage that occurs prior to gelation relative to the total shrinkage were determined as the two dominant factors that control the final shrinkage stress of the ternary systems which was reduced by more than 40 % in the ternary system as compared to either pure monomer formulation. To increase the modulus further, silica nanoparticles functionalized by a 16 -functional hyperbranched alkene were incorporated into this ternary resin, which demonstrated 30 % reduced shrinkage stress without sacrificing the modulus (3200 ± 200 MPa) or Tg (62 ± 3 °C). Moreover, it was observed that the shrinkage stress of the composite builds up at much later stages of the polymerization. Finally, an induction polymerization method was developed as an alternative to UV curing to address challenges associated with the restriction of light accessibility in highly filled composite systems. This method was able to cure completely samples up to 1 cm thick in as little as 2 minutes. The reaction kinetics of thiol-ene and thiol-acrylate systems were studied and a model of heat transfer profiles combined with reaction kinetics was developed and utilized to predict reaction temperatures and kinetics for systems with varying thermal initiator concentration, initiator half-life, monomer molecular weight and temperature gradients in samples with varying thickness; thereby demonstrating that induction curing represents a designable and tunable polymerization metho...|$|R

We conclude that one T>= 9 / 2 isobaric analog state {{does not affect the}} spectral correlations of a sequence of 124 T<= 7 / 2 states, and that the observed deviations from RMT are due to unobserved levels. For the reduced <b>widths,</b> however, certain <b>deviations</b> from Porter–Thomas statistics are attributed to the effect of isospin mixing...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{statistics}} of resonance widths in a many-body Fermi system with open decay channels. Depending {{on the strength}} of continuum coupling, such a system reveals growing deviations from the standard chi-square (Porter-Thomas) <b>width</b> distribution. The <b>deviations</b> emerge from the process of increasing interaction of intrinsic states through common decay channels; in the limit of perfect coupling this process leads to the superradiance phase transition. The width distribution depends also on the intrinsic dynamics (chaotic versus regular). The results presented here are important for understanding the recent experimental data concerning the width distribution for neutron resonances in nuclei...|$|R
40|$|The {{shape of}} {{tensioned}} fabric structures is realised via {{a process of}} patterning, which involves ‘flattening’ of sections, or panels, of a 3 D membrane, onto a plane. The patterning method proposed here uses bicubic spline descriptions of surfaces undergoing flattening, followed by elastic analysis of strains arising from this process and from membrane pre-stress. The results, which ensure stress compatibility along panel edges, produce a cutting pattern and stress variation within it when the panel is assembled into the 3 D form. They confirm a general relationship between panel <b>width</b> and stress <b>deviation</b> from the intended pre-stress reported in [1]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Ecological interaction, {{including}} {{competition for}} resources, often causes frequency-dependent disruptive selection, which, when accompanied by reproductive isolation, may act as driving forces of adaptive speciation. While adaptive dynamics models have added new perspectives {{to our understanding}} of the ecological dimensions of speciation processes, it remains an open question how best to incorporate and analyze genetic detail in such models. Conventional approaches, based on quantitative genetics theory, typically assume a unimodal character distribution and examine how its moments change over time. Such approximations inevitably fail when a character distribution becomes multimodal. Here, we propose a new approximation, oligomorphic dynamics, to the quantitative genetics of populations that include several morphs and that therefore exhibit multiple peaks in their character distribution. To this end, we first decompose the character distribution into a sum of unimodal distributions corresponding to individual morphs. Characterizing these morphs by their frequency (fraction of individuals belonging to each morph), position (mean character of each morph), and <b>width</b> (standard <b>deviation</b> of each morph), we then derive th...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Unidirectional {{random waves}} {{generated}} by a wavemaker in a 300 -m-long wave tank are investigated experimentally. Spatial evolution of numerous statistical wave field parameters is studied. It is found that the frequency spectrum of the wave field undergoes significant variation {{in the course of}} its evolution along the tank; the values of all statistical wave parameters are strongly related to the local spectral <b>width.</b> The <b>deviations</b> of various statistical parameters from the Gaussian statistics increase with the width of the spectrum, so that the probability of extremely large (the so-called freak) waves is highest when the local spectral width attains maximum. It is found that the third-order random wave field model of Tayfun and Fedele [1] provides an appropriate description of the observed phenomena. The laboratory runs are reproduced through numerical simulations of the spatial form of the Dysthe equation. The simulation reproduce the wave shapes observed in laboratory, though for very steep waves some deviations in the computed wave shapes and the envelopes from those measured in the tank were observed at larger distances...|$|R
