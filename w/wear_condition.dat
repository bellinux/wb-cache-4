In this paper, the feed cutting force estimated with the aid of an inexpensive current sensor installed on the ac servomotor of a computerized numerical control turning center is used to monitor tool <b>wear</b> <b>condition.</b> To achieve this, the feed drive system is modeled, using neuro-fuzzy techniques, to provide the framework for estimating the feed cutting force based on the feed motor current measured.

The computerized system automatically compares successive feed cutting force estimates and determines the onset of accelerated tool wear in order to issue a request for tool replacement.

The monitoring of the tool <b>wear</b> and breakage <b>conditions</b> on YCM-V 116 B machining center was studied, and the acquired milling sound signals were analyzed in detail. By means of the classical time-frequency analysis, it was discovered that the wear sound had its own characteristic frequency band, and the frequency component within the frequency band would change according to the change of <b>wear</b> <b>conditions.</b> So that the frequency component within the frequency band will be a good indicator to monitor the tool <b>wear</b> <b>conditions</b> excellently. On the other hand, the tool breakage sound is a random signal that a transient change in amplitude is produced probably when tool breaks. The tool breakage conditions can be detected exactly by the advantages of wavelet decomposition techniques. The analysis implies that the sound generated during the machining process can be used to monitor tool conditions, which provides a new approach to the sound applications in tool monitoring domain...|$|R

A {{brake pad}} wear control {{algorithm}} used under uncritical braking conditions is proposed to reduce the difference in {{brake pad wear}} between {{the front and rear}} axles caused by the difference in braking force and the type of brake. The algorithm regulates the distribution of braking force within the limits of certain braking regulations according to the <b>wear</b> <b>conditions</b> of the brake pads while deceleration control still functions properly. Computer co-simulations of braking with Trucksim and Matlab/Simulink was performed in which vehicle models with equal brake pad wear, greater wear on the front axle and greater wear on the rear axle were used.

We {{propose a}} {{supervisory}} technique {{to monitor the}} material removal state and tool <b>wear</b> <b>condition</b> {{as well as the}} estimation method for overall power consumed in the machining from the effective spindle power change. The effective power (VAcosφ) was the optimal motor related parameter to represent the motor load. The cutting condition can be related with the effective power change by using the averaged effective power for 0. 2 seconds. The mean effective power is in proportion to the material removal rate. In addition, the averaged effective power can monitor continuously the tool <b>wear</b> <b>condition</b> and tool breakage. There was a series of cutting conditions where the specific effective power becomes minimum in the grooving operation. Under the cutting conditions with the minimum specific effective power, the cutting would have been conducting at the least cutting resistance and less overall power consumed. These facts indicates that we can determine the cutting conditions, where the cutting resistance and overall power consumed are getting minimum at the same time, by measuring the effective spindle power change during the operation...|$|E
