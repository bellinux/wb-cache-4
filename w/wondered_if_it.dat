MacLeod {{wrote of}} another {{tradition}} which {{stated that the}} flag was waved at a battle in Waternish, in about 1580; and of another which told of how it was waved {{during a time when}} a cattle plague was raging, and that it stopped the murrain. R.C. MacLeod stated his belief that the flag would only have been waved twice, and so rejected the tradition of it being unfurled at the Battle of Bloody Bay—because the MacLeods were on the losing side! R.C. MacLeod also <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had been waved in 1600, when the clan was in a desperate state in the midst of warring with the Macdonalds of Sleat.|$|E
5|$|The first popular {{rock music}} bootleg {{resulted}} from Bob Dylan's activities between largely disappearing {{from the public}} eye after his motorcycle accident in 1966, {{and the release of}} John Wesley Harding at the end of 1967. After a number of artists had hits with Dylan songs that he had not officially recorded and released himself, demand increased for these recordings, particularly when they started airing on local radio in Los Angeles. Through various contacts in the radio industry, a number of pioneering bootleggers managed to buy a reel to reel tape containing a selection of unreleased Dylan songs intended for distribution for music publishers and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> would be possible to manufacture them on an LP. They managed to convince a local pressing plant to press between 1,000 and 2,000 copies discreetly, paying in cash and avoiding using real names or addresses. Since the bootleggers could not commercially print a sleeve, due to it attracting too much attention from recording companies, the LP was issued in a plain white cover with Great White Wonder rubber stamped on it. Subsequently, Dylan {{became one of the most}} popular artists to be bootlegged with numerous releases.|$|E
25|$|When Congress {{passed the}} Second Organic Act in 1912, Alaska was reorganized, and renamed the Territory of Alaska. By 1916, its {{population}} was about 58,000. James Wickersham, a Delegate to Congress, introduced Alaska's first statehood bill, but it failed {{due to the}} small population and lack of interest from Alaskans. Even President Warren G. Harding's visit in 1923 could not create widespread interest in statehood. Under {{the conditions of the}} Second Organic Act, Alaska had been split into four divisions. The most populous of the divisions, whose capital was Juneau, <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> could become a separate state from the other three. Government control was a primary concern, with the territory having 52 federal agencies governing it.|$|E

500|$|During {{the season}} Charlotte's storylines had mixed reactions. Jensen thought Charlotte and Faraday's {{mission to the}} Tempest in [...] "The Other Woman" [...] felt [...] "forced". Dan Compora from Airlock Alpha liked Charlotte and Juliet's fight scene in this episode. BuddyTV's Oscar Dahl thought the whole plot at the Tempest was [...] "filler" [...] and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had been added just to give Charlotte and Faraday {{something}} to do. After Charlotte speaks Korean in [...] "Something Nice Back Home", James Poniewozik from Time became curious about her past because she is [...] "the member of the four freighties whom we know the least about, and the most secretive and sinister-seeming of the bunch". Chris Carabott was also intrigued after this scene, which he called [...] "one of the more unexpected scenes".|$|E
500|$|Astronomers at the time, {{including}} Edmond Halley, {{speculated that}} this comet was {{a return of}} a bright comet seen close to the Sun in the sky in 1106. 163 years later, the Great Comet of 1843 appeared and also passed extremely close to the Sun. Despite orbital calculations showing {{that it had a}} period of several centuries, some astronomers <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was a return of the 1680 comet. [...] A bright comet seen in 1880 was found to be travelling on an almost identical orbit to that of 1843, as was the subsequent Great Comet of 1882. [...] Some astronomers suggested that perhaps they were all one comet, whose orbital period was somehow being drastically shortened at each perihelion passage, perhaps by retardation by some dense material surrounding the Sun.|$|E

500|$|I {{always loved}} going to Ogmore and Southerndown. I thought the cliffs there {{looked like a}} {{building}} anyway. A building capable of withstanding the roughest weather for hundreds of years. The older they get, the better they look. I <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> {{would be possible to}} make a building which had the same qualities as these magnificent cliffs. To do that I needed a lot of stone. Normal stone for buildings has to be specially cut into blocks; {{it takes a long time}} to make and costs a fortune. But in north Wales the historic slate industry has left behind whole mountains of waste stone that no-one wants. This was stone cut from the mountainside for nearly two hundred years but which wasn't good enough to make roof slates. Over 90% was thrown away. But it was ideal for making walls like the one I had in mind... —architect Jonathan Adams ...|$|E
500|$|Milk drifted from California to Texas to New York, {{without a}} steady job or plan. In New York City he became {{involved}} with O'Horgan's theater company as a [...] "general aide", signing on as associate producer for Lenny and for Eve Merriam's Inner City. The time he had spent with the cast of flower children wore away much of Milk's conservatism. A contemporary New York Times story about O'Horgan described Milk as [...] "a sad eyed man—another aging hippie with long, long hair, wearing faded jeans and pretty beads". Craig Rodwell read {{the description of the}} formerly uptight man and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> could be the same person. One of Milk's Wall Street friends worried that he seemed to have no plan or future, but remembered Milk's attitude: [...] "I think he was happier than at any time I had ever seen him in his entire life." ...|$|E
500|$|Consecutive {{losses to}} Chicago and San Jose, coupled with two {{victories}} by Colorado eliminated the Flames from playoff contention {{in the final}} week of the season. [...] The Flames failed {{to qualify for the}} post season {{for the first time since}} 2003. [...] Flames players lamented their inability to score goals at key times as a primary reason for the team's failure. The dismal result for the Flames led fans and media to question whether the team needed to make significant changes in the off-season. The future of General Manager Darryl Sutter with the team was called into question, while many <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> was time to part ways with captain Jarome Iginla, who had been with the team since 1996. [...] For his part, Iginla accepted responsibility for the failed season, and said he did not wish to leave Calgary, wanting instead to lead the Flames into a rebound season in 2010–11. [...] When pressed by the media, he stated he would be willing to waive his no movement clause if the team asked him to, though Flames management dismissed speculation that they would consider dealing the team's captain.|$|E

500|$|Manga creator Katsura Hoshino {{said that}} she did not know how Allen originated, since she likes her main {{characters}} to be rambunctious, rude idiots. She said that the general idea for his design was an [...] "energetic youth with messy fly-a-way hair and other things like that", but when he was drawn with the uniform of the Black Order (the group Allen joins in the series) she sensed a [...] "lack of coordination". Hoshino felt that a more-mature design would be better; although she believed his final design looked best with the Black Order uniform, she <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> should be more masculine. Because he is an Exorcist, she wanted him to have a [...] "very scary-looking image" [...] and added the scar on his left forehead; the scar changed shape several times before becoming a pentagram. Since Hoshino wanted the Order and its enemies to have visual contrast, she gave Allen and the Exorcists black cloaks to convey a [...] "gloomy" [...] impression. Allen's clothing is drawn from Hoshino's general impression of the late nineteenth century, and his ribbon tie and other accessories are intended to project a [...] "gentlemanly image".|$|E
500|$|The two men {{discussed}} [...] "natural aristocracy." [...] Jefferson said, [...] "The natural aristocracy I {{consider as}} the most precious gift of nature for the instruction, the trusts, and government of society. And indeed {{it would have been}} inconsistent in creation to have formed man for the social state, and not to have provided virtue and wisdom enough to manage the concerns of society. May we not even say that the form of government is best which provides most effectually for a pure selection of these natural [...] into the offices of government?" [...] Adams <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> ever would be so clear who these people were, [...] "Your distinction between natural and artificial aristocracy does not appear to me well founded. Birth and wealth are conferred on some men as imperiously by nature, as genius, strength, or beauty. ... When aristocracies are established by human laws and honour, wealth, and power are made hereditary by municipal laws and political institutions, then I acknowledge artificial aristocracy to commence." [...] It would always be true, Adams argued, that fate would bestow influence on some men for reasons other than true wisdom and virtue. That being the way of nature, he thought such [...] "talents" [...] were natural. A good government, therefore, had to account for that reality.|$|E

2500|$|During the Beagle survey expedition, {{the young}} naturalist Charles Darwin had {{remarkable}} success with fossil hunting in Patagonia. On 10 October 1833, at Santa Fe, Argentina, he was [...] "filled with astonishment" [...] {{when he found}} a horse's tooth in the same stratum as fossil giant armadillos, and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> might have been washed down from a later layer, but concluded this was [...] "not very probable". After the expedition returned in 1836, the anatomist Richard Owen confirmed the tooth was from an extinct species, which he subsequently named Equus curvidens, and remarked, [...] "This evidence of the former existence of a genus, which, as regards South America, had become extinct, and has a second time been introduced into that Continent, {{is not one of}} the least interesting fruits of Mr. Darwin's palæontological discoveries." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the Indian Express, {{soon after}} its {{inception}} in May 1999 the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) {{worked hard to get}} rid of its [...] "Kunbi Only" [...] image. Sharad Pawar found, after breaking away from the Congress, that {{it was not possible to}} win elections with just the Kunbi vote. In order to attract the non-Kunbi OBC vote, estimated to form 40% of the electorate, Pawar recruited Chhagan Bhujbal (a Mali), and Pandurang Hajare (a Teli). Even though Pawar recruited other Telis like Pandurang Dhole, the Indian Express <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> would be enough to counter the age-old and keen Kunbi versus Teli rivalry. A closer look at local and regional leaders in the NCP revealed that almost all of them belonged to the Kunbi community. In 2009, the NCP president Sharad Pawar chose Anil Deshmukh over Rajendra Shingane as party candidate from the Vidharbha region because he represented the huge Kunbi-Marathi community there.|$|E

2500|$|On {{announcement}} of the storyline, Soaplife said it [...] "could be fun but could be the ruin of Kat if they get it wrong", and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> would put EastEnders [...] "back on top of its game", saying, [...] "That depends on Kat. If we're made to love and care about her, yes. If she comes over as a conniving, sneaky cheat only interested in her own wants and desires, no." [...] They opined that Alfie {{should be the one}} having the affair, as he cannot do anything right in Kat's eyes. They also said they [...] "wondered which Kat we'd be getting back after Jessie Wallace's break. Would it be the tart with a heart that made Kat a soap icon? Or the alley Kat that we got last year (Kat down the alley with delivery man Mark was not her finest moment). Now with the reveal that she'll have a mystery that we can all spend weeks or months trying to guess , we fear it will be more alley Kat." [...] All About Soap thought that because of the way Kat got rid of Roxy after she moved in with Alfie while Kat was away, [...] "you'd think that [...] Kat was really committed to her husband [...] and determined to make her marriage work" [...] but called the affair [...] "sizzling", saying it would [...] "send shockwaves all round Albert Square!" [...] Soaplife said that the storyline {{may turn out to be}} a good mystery, but [...] "when it comes to affairs, we prefer ours with a heap-big dose of love". However, they later said the storyline was [...] "getting boring". In All About Soap, letters page editor Laura thought the affair would be [...] "the hottest thing in the Square this summer!" [...] Soaplife awarded the storyline a bronze medal in their [...] "2012 Soap Olympics" [...] for [...] "best storyline cycling", as Kat is [...] "cheating again. Round and round she goes."

Yes, it's a bit annoying when your other half is too busy to pay you much attention—but there should at least be an effort to sort out your issues before you decide cheating is the answer! We're finding it hard to have sympathy". The magazine later called the storyline [...] "unusual" [...] but said that [...] "Kat has been busy showing us how infidelity should be done". When the affair turned from lust to love, Soaplife said that it was [...] "what the affair needed right from the start in order to save Kat's reputation." [...] Steven Murphy, editor of Inside Soap said that when the storyline started, he and his colleagues were [...] "a little intrigued" [...] but after Michael was eliminated, they were [...] "totally obsessed!"
