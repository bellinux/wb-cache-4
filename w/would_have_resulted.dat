5|$|At 23:30, Fleet and Lee {{noticed a}} slight haze {{on the horizon}} ahead of them, but did not make {{anything}} of it. Some experts now believe that this haze was actually a mirage caused by cold waters meeting warm air (similar to a water mirage in the desert) when Titanic entered Iceberg Alley. This <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> in a raised horizon, blinding the lookouts from spotting anything far away.|$|E
5|$|Mieszko thus {{strove to}} subdue Pomerania at the Baltic coast. The area {{was the site}} of wealthy trade emporia, {{frequently}} visited by traders, especially from the east, west and north. Mieszko had {{every reason to believe that}} great profits <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> from his ability to control the rich seaports situated on long distance trade routes such as Wolin, Szczecin and Kołobrzeg.|$|E
5|$|By 1970, {{scientists}} {{realized this}} pose was incorrect {{and could not}} have been maintained by a living animal, as it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> in the dislocation or weakening of several joints, including the hips and the articulation between the head and the spinal column. The inaccurate AMNH mount inspired similar depictions in many films and paintings (such as Rudolph Zallinger's famous mural The Age of Reptiles in Yale University's Peabody Museum of Natural History) until the 1990s, when films such as Jurassic Park introduced a more accurate posture to the general public.|$|E
50|$|It can {{be argued}} that an American attack <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{probably}} <b>resulted</b> in the deaths of Soviet soldiers and a retaliatory strike on another American position in the world such as West Berlin. Such moves <b>would</b> <b>have</b> possibly <b>resulted</b> in an all-out nuclear war between the Soviet Union and the United States.|$|R

5|$|If Mirs main {{computer}} {{had failed}} after Progress M1-5 had docked, then the flight plan {{would have been}} modified to use either the station's BUPO rendezvous system, or the Progress for control. Under this plan, the third deorbit burn would have been conducted 24 hours after the first two burns, with the station being spin-stabilised again between {{the second and third}} burns. Controllers also planned for a failure of Mirs power system, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> in the deorbit being delayed one day, with all guidance and control functions being handled by the Progress spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|In 1861 a {{proposal}} {{was made to}} construct a road from Blackfriars to the Mansion House; this <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> in the complete demolition of the College. However, protests from the heralds resulted in only parts of the south east and south west wings being sliced off, requiring extensive remodelling. The College was now a three-sided building with an open courtyard facing the New Queen Victoria Street laid out in 1866. The terrace, steps and entrance porch were also added around this time.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, a {{campaign}} began {{to register the}} Glamorgan sausage under the European Union geographical indications and traditional specialities scheme. This <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> in only Glamorgan sausages that were made in Glamorgan being labelled as such. The move was led by Greta Watts-Jones, who runs the Cwrt Newydd company in Cowbridge, which was the only major manufacturer in the area. Her main competitor, Cauldron Foods, is based in Bristol, England. This protection had previously been extended to Welsh lamb and beef. The vote to gain this status, alongside Caerphilly cheese, was held in March 2006 at the European Parliament, but was not passed into law.|$|E

50|$|On Earth, Kronos pursued {{experiments}} into cosmic energies; however, one {{of these}} experiments <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>results</b> quite different than expected. Exploding in his face, Kronos was atomized, his energies becoming the Titan God of Time, whilst all other Earth Eternals were doused in fallout radiation; these radiations altered the genetics of all Eternals they touched, activating their latent abilities, and ensuring that all born to the Earth Eternals <b>would</b> <b>have</b> similarly activated genes and levels of power.|$|R

The Agreement described a plan for transitional governance that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>result</b> in legislative and presidential election within two years of its signing and marked the formal end of the Second Congo War.|$|R
5|$|Tanev {{played a}} major role in the 2016 IIHF World Championships team which {{captured}} gold against Finland. He was praised for his composure and defensive play by Team Canada head coach Bill Peters, and was named the best player of the game in Canada's 7-1 victory over Hungary. In the tournament semifinal versus the United States, Tanev robbed a scoring chance from the Americans late in the third period, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> in the tying goal. After accidentally breaking his stick in the American zone, he raced back to the Canadian end, intercepting a pass and blocking a shot without the use of his stick.|$|E
5|$|The Mission {{site had}} been under study for {{conservation}} since 2002. The three main buildings on the site were eventually gazetted for conservation in 2006, and hence the site was inappropriate for acquisition. Although the appellant had argued that a football field on the Mission site should have been acquired instead of the temple property, the three main buildings were functionally integrated and acquisition of part of the Mission site <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> in a plot of state land that was highly irregular in shape. In any case, the appellant's argument did not relate to proper land use planning.|$|E
5|$|As {{an amateur}} rugby union player John was not paid to play rugby at club or {{international}} level. To receive money for playing {{would have been}} recognised {{as an act of}} professionalism and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> in action from one of the governing unions, normally suspension or a ban. To prevent players switching to professional rugby league, players were given 'boot money' by their clubs or sponsors, named after the early practice of placing money in the players' boots. In his 2011 book Addy, Meirion Appleton claimed that in the 1970s he made illegal payments to both John and Gareth Edwards. Appleton claims that before an international match he gave both players envelopes containing money from sportswear manufacturer Adidas. John was never charged with taking illegal payments during his career.|$|E
5000|$|At some {{levels of}} play, verbal {{as well as}} {{physical}} hindrance can be called for interference. For example, if a runner or other member of the offense calls out [...] "foul" [...] on a fair ball or [...] "mine" [...] on a fly ball, he may cause the defense to react differently from how they otherwise <b>would</b> <b>have,</b> <b>resulting</b> in an interference call. This is not called as interference in professional or higher amateur baseball.|$|R
50|$|Bay of Plenty <b>would</b> <b>have</b> mixed <b>results</b> in 2010. They {{would win}} seven of {{thirteen}} matches including a rare win in Wellington.Disappointing losses to Tasman and Northland would see Bay of Plenty finish in 6th position.|$|R

She <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had to take very nearly the whole bottle {{to account for the}} amount of strychnine found at the post-mortem." ...|$|R
5|$|Because {{the tail}} {{had at least}} forty caudal vertebrae, it was highly mobile. It could {{possibly}} swing at an arc of 180 degrees, covering the entire half circle behind it. Swing speeds {{at the tail end}} may have been as high as 50km/h. Continuous rapid swings would have allowed the spikes to slash open the skin of its attacker or to stab the soft tissues and break the ribs or facial bones. More directed blows <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> in the sides of the spikes fracturing even sturdy longbones of the legs by blunt trauma. These attacks would have crippled small and medium-sized theropods and may even have done some damage to large ones. Earlier interpretations of the defensive behaviour of Kentrosaurus included the suggestion that the animal might have charged to the rear, to run through attackers with its spines, in the way of modern porcupines.|$|E
5|$|Celtic faced Yugoslavia (now Serbian) side Vojvodina Novi Sad in the quarter-finals, {{and lost}} {{the first leg}} 1–0 after a goal from Milan Stanić; this was Celtic's only defeat of the competition. The tie {{looked like it was}} going to end in a draw after Chalmers had given Celtic a 1–0 lead in the second leg. This <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> in the teams from having to go to Rotterdam for a replay. However, in the 90th minute captain Billy McNeill scored to give Celtic the victory. In the semi-finals, Czechoslovakian side Dukla Prague were beaten 3–1 in Glasgow, Johnstone put the hosts in front, before Stanislav Štrunc equalised. A second half brace from Willie Wallace gave Celtic the victory. The teams then drew 0–0 in Prague, which meant Celtic progressed to the final.|$|E
5|$|Hampden {{hosted the}} 1960 European Cup Final; Real Madrid {{defeated}} 7–3 Eintracht Frankfurt with 130,000 people in attendance. Floodlights were installed at Hampden in 1961 and were inaugurated with a friendly match between Eintracht Frankfurt and Rangers. The ground then also hosted the 1962 and 1966 finals of the European Cup Winners' Cup. The attendances {{for each of}} these finals was less than 50,000, and the SFA did not offer to host another European final until the 1976 European Cup Final, in which Bayern Munich defeated St Etienne. Until 1987, Hampden used square goalposts. St Etienne believed that two of their efforts which hit the square crossbar and rebounded into play <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> in goals if it had been round.|$|E
50|$|Eichmann Interrogated reads {{mostly as}} Eichmann denying any {{personal}} responsibility for Germany's mass executions. He repeatedly claims he was only in charge of transportation of Jewish and enemy civilians, he was only following orders, and that disobeying such orders <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>result</b> in his own execution. He also claims that other, previously tried German war criminals, deliberately implicated him to mitigate their personal responsibility. Eichmann also denies any feelings of antisemitism; indeed, {{he claims to have}} attempted to create a homeland for Jews, once in Madagascar and later in Eastern Europe.|$|R
50|$|The Army's {{failures}} caused Díez {{to believe}} that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> better <b>results</b> with a system of guerrilla warfare. Thus started his wartime success, in such places as Aranda de Duero, Sepúlveda, Pedraza, and throughout the Duero river basin.|$|R
25|$|From the {{beginning}} of fission-electric power station commercialization in the 1970s, nuclear power prevented the emission of about 64 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> otherwise <b>resulted</b> from the {{burning of fossil fuels}} in thermal power stations.|$|R
5|$|The Vikings won {{the coin}} toss and started {{overtime}} with {{possession of the}} football on their own 29-yard line, but managed to convert only one first down and punted to Atlanta. The Falcons drove to their own 41-yard line before being stopped on 3rd down, and they punted the ball back to Vikings. On the ensuing drive, Cunningham attempted a deep pass to Moss that was narrowly broken up by Eugene Robinson; had the pass been completed, it most likely <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> in a touchdown and victory for the Vikings. Instead, the Vikings had to punt on 4th down again. The Falcons then drove to the Vikings' 21-yard line, where Morten Andersen converted a 38-yard field goal for the win.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} Dinner was {{announced}} in August 2010, to open in early 2011 to replace the Michelin starred restaurant Foliage at the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park. The opening was originally planned for 1 December, but delays occurred, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> in the restaurant being ready to open during Christmas week. The {{decision was made to}} push back the opening until after the Christmas period was over. Reservations began to be accepted on 1 December 2010 for the restaurant's opening on 31 January 2011. There were 42 phone lines set up on the opening day of reservations, which received over 600 telephone bookings. Prior to opening, the first three months were solidly booked. A Valentine's day booking was sold on auction site eBay, which went for £250.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposal}} was strongly opposed by both environmentalists {{as well as}} local residents. The economy of southeastern British Columbia is strongly dependent on tourism, with the Columbia River, including Columbia Lake and Windermere Lake, being very popular for summer swimming and boating activities. Diversion of the glacier-fed Kootenay River <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> in the Columbia River becoming much deeper and colder, flooding riverside communities and damaging tourism. At {{the opposite end of the}} scale, it would dry the bed of the Kootenay River downstream of Canal Flats, cutting off water supply to residents of the upper Kootenay Valley and invalidating the effectiveness of Libby Dam, whose construction was to begin in a few years. As a result, this proposed river diversion was never undertaken.|$|E
40|$|An {{earlier study}} {{published}} in this Journal by Cebula and Chevlin finds that {{the passage of a}} tax-expenditure limitation (TEL) statute in all of the 50 states <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> in a reduction in the per capita levels of both spending and taxes. The present study takes issue with this finding. In particular, using the same data as Cebula and Chevlin, it is demonstrated here that, by applying the formula for statistically significant means, the existence of Proposition 4 or its equivalent in each of the 50 states <b>would</b> <b>have,</b> in theory, <b>resulted</b> in a statistically significant reduction in both per capita nominal state plus local government spending and taxes. ...|$|R

5|$|In two instances, the equestrian {{portion of}} the Olympics has been held in a {{different}} location {{from the rest of}} the games. The first was during the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia when, due to Australian quarantine laws, the equestrian portion was held in Stockholm, Sweden. At the next IOC meeting, it was decided to hold a special Equestrian Olympic Games several months before the actual Olympics, complete with its own opening and closing ceremonies. This meant that Switzerland, which had officially boycotted the 1956 Games because of the Soviet Union's recent invasion of Hungary, still brought home a medal because of its participation in the equestrian portion several months earlier. The second instance was during the 2008 Summer Olympics, when the equestrian events were held in Hong Kong rather than Beijing. This decision was made when, in 2005, international veterinary groups refused to certify the main Olympic city as free of equine diseases. This <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> in horses leaving Beijing after the games and having to go through lengthy quarantine processes before being allowed to re-enter their home countries. Hong Kong also had the benefit of having better facilities, including a top equine hospital and one of only a few equine drug-testing labs in the world.|$|E
5|$|Richard Maunsell was {{appointed}} CME of the SECR in 1913, following the enforced retirement of Harry Wainwright, {{who had left}} a range of competent but unspectacular locomotive classes that struggled {{to cope with the}} increased train lengths and loadings. Maunsell reviewed the situation and planned to introduce six standard classes – using only two boiler designs – which would work the entire traffic of the railway. The first of these was the Nclass 2-6-0, which gave the SECR a capable mixed-traffic locomotive. For the express passenger design that could cope with the heavy boat trains, Maunsell wanted to enlarge the existing Lclass 4-4-0 with Walschaerts valve gear and an enlarged superheater, but this design <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> in a too heavy axle loading. Maunsell's newly recruited assistants, G.H.Pearson and Harold Holcroft from the Great Western Railway at Swindon and James Clayton from the Midland Railway at Derby, had recently been involved in the design of large passenger tank engines and persuaded him to use the 2-6-4 wheel arrangement, which would allow the class to operate at high speeds on the poor-quality track in north Kent.|$|E
5|$|Ryan's budget plans {{proposed}} privatizing Medicare {{for those}} {{under the age}} of 55, and funding Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program through block grants to the states. In 2012 Ryan proposed that Medicaid be converted into block grants, but with the federal government's share of the cost cut by some $800 billion over the next decade. Currently, Medicaid is administered by the states, subject to federal rules concerning eligibility, and the amount paid by the federal government depends on {{the number of people who}} qualify. His plan would have undone a Reagan-era reform by which the federal government prohibited the states from requiring that a patient's spouse, as well as the patient, deplete all of his or her assets before Medicaid would cover long-term care. Ryan’s budget plan proposed raising the Medicare eligibility age, beginning in 2023, by two months a year, until it reached 67 in 2034. A 2011 analysis, conducted by the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research group, for the Kaiser Family Foundation, estimated that Ryan's 2011 plan <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> in 14 million to 27 million fewer people receiving Medicaid coverage by 2021.|$|E
5000|$|Within {{two days}} of the post {{regarding}} the pay structure being published, University President Beverlee McClure issued Ledonne with a ‘No Trespass Order’ of the university campus and its buildings {{on the grounds that}} his behavior was deemed to be disruptive, detrimental and posed a safety risk to the university. The university labelled Ledonne as a [...] "terrorist" [...] and that any attempt to enter the campus <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>result</b> in him being arrested. The ban also prohibited Ledonne from attending the 2015 edition of the Southern Colorado Film Festival, which he was the president of, and was therefore forced to resign from his post.|$|R
