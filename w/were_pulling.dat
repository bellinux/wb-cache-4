5|$|The {{invention}} of the wheel was a major technological innovation {{that gave rise to}} chariot warfare. At first, equines, both horses and onagers, were hitched to wheeled carts by means of a yoke around their necks {{in a manner similar to}} that of oxen. However, such a design is incompatible with equine anatomy, limiting both the strength and mobility of the animal. By the time of the Hyksos invasions of Egypt, c.1600 BC, horses <b>were</b> <b>pulling</b> chariots with an improved harness design that made use of a breastcollar and breeching, which allowed a horse to move faster and pull more weight.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{there were}} a growing range of demands on the mounted police, and they {{struggled}} {{to cope with the}} changes. The rising population drove an increase in the criminal cases tackled by the force: less than 1,000 were investigated in 1900, but within four years the number of cases had risen to over 4,000. There was controversy around what role the mounted police should play in the new towns, and the force became concerned that these <b>were</b> <b>pulling</b> in police manpower, {{at the expense of the}} wider, less populated areas of the Prairies, where the patrolling system had already had to be cut back. A special railway branch was briefly established in 1888, using undercover officers positioned along the railway line to gather intelligence, and plans were put forward, but not enacted, to create a larger detective branch. Attempts were made to enforce the prostitution laws in the new towns – previously these had been largely ignored – with the police informally regulating the local sex industries.|$|E
5|$|Human Revolution {{was planned}} for {{consoles}} and Microsoft Windows systems, {{and one of}} the things Dugas insisted upon was that the PC version would not be a port of the console versions. With this in mind, the two versions needed to be as close as possible in gameplay feel. The full motion cutscenes were created collaboratively by Eidos Montréal, Square Enix's CGI department Visual Works, and Vancouver-based company Goldtooth Creative. Goldtooth created initial concepts based on the game, then the animation proper was handled by Visual Works. It was later stated that, despite knowing the necessity of incorporating multiple story-telling methods into the game, the team felt that the cutscene creation process was turned into a multi-studio effort due to time constraints. Time limits also forced them to drop real-time cutscenes. For the engine, the team used the Crystal Engine, developed by Crystal Dynamics and previously used in Tomb Raider Legend. It was intended to be part of a technology sharing policy that would further improve the engine for distribution in an enhanced form. Despite the initial intentions and an early tech demo going smoothly, the engine quickly proved to be inadequate to the team's needs as Eidos Montréal and Crystal Dynamics <b>were</b> <b>pulling</b> the engine's design in different directions. Eidos Montréal were given permission to branch away from the core engine so they could make the game work, adding new production tools that made it work in the new environment.|$|E

25|$|Prisoners of {{war were}} {{exchanged}} by Russia and Georgia. A Georgian {{official said that}} although his country exchanged five Russian servicemen for fifteen Georgians (including two civilians), Georgia suspected that Russia still held two more Georgians.

Earlier, Russia had claimed that Russian troops <b>were</b> <b>pulling</b> back while Georgia was not complying with the ceasefire.|$|E
25|$|Eyewitness {{accounts}} of the attacks were mostly confused and spotty. Hotlines {{set up for the}} investigation were flooded with tips. Early tips from eyewitnesses included reports of a white box truck with dark lettering, speeding away from the Leisure World shopping center, with two men inside. Police across the area and the state of Maryland <b>were</b> <b>pulling</b> over white vans and trucks. A gray car was spotted speeding away after the October 4 shooting in Spotsylvania.|$|E
25|$|As {{troops of}} the 92nd Division {{streamed}} back, they were ordered to take up positions on the left flank of the Indian positions. All Allied troops forming the defence were placed under command of Major General Russell, the 8th Indian Division commanders However, the Axis objectives were short of the Indian line and so the Axis attack was not pressed forward. By late afternoon on December 27, all objectives having been attained, the offensive ended and by the following day the Axis troops <b>were</b> <b>pulling</b> back towards their start lines.|$|E

25|$|Mansell and Patrese <b>were</b> <b>pulling</b> {{away from}} Senna {{while there was}} a battle for fourth between Prost, Alesi and Piquet. On lap 26, Senna retired with {{alternator}} troubles and two laps later Prost was out with a failed gearbox. Alesi was third but on lap 35, his engine expired. This put Mansell in front of Patrese, Piquet, Modena, Andrea de Cesaris and Ivan Capelli. Patrese had to pit with a puncture and rejoined behind Piquet. He then had gearbox troubles and was passed by Modena as Capelli spun off.|$|E
25|$|When Sheridan {{discovered}} the Confederates <b>were</b> <b>pulling</b> back, he sent Custer's division, mostly dismounted, in pursuit {{on the left}} and Devin's mounted division in pursuit on the right. A few artillery pieces and Gregg's brigade from Crook's corps moved forward in support. As noted in the previous section, Sheridan had received wrong information so he thought the V Corps was in the rear and almost on the flank of the Confederates and therefore he mistakenly thought V Corps could launch an early, severe attack on Pickett's force. Without infantry support, Sheridan did not press his divisions to carry the attack by themselves.|$|E
25|$|In November 1915, the British {{military}} hero Field Marshal Lord Kitchener {{toured the}} Dardanelles {{as part of}} his review of the Middle Eastern theatre of operations. After two hours at Anzac Cove, he instructed Lt General Birdwood, the Commander of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force to begin planning to evacuate the Peninsula. Winter was coming and already too many soldiers were being taken sick and even dying of hypothermia and frostbite, while the Turks had been stubbornly holding their ground. Retreat made sense, aside from just one problem: once the Turks figured out the troops <b>were</b> <b>pulling</b> back, the retreat would very quickly become a bloodbath.|$|E

25|$|With {{the battle}} underway, Israeli {{reinforcements}} were ordered into the fight. The four 117 Squadron Mirages {{which had been}} lurking at low altitude over the Sinai, {{beyond the reach of}} Egyptian and Soviet radar, <b>were</b> <b>pulling</b> up and proceeding westward when Itamar Neuner's jet suffered an engine malfunction and had to abort the mission. Wary of leaving Neuner alone in hostile territory, Even-Nir escorted his wingman back to Rephidim. A 101 Squadron pair, Iftach Spector and Michael Tzuk, were scrambled to replace them. Spector, however, soon lost sight of Tzuk and ordered him to return to base, proceeding into the battle by himself. The remaining 117 pair, Koren and Richter, were also about to engage the Soviet fighters.|$|E
25|$|The Williamses {{pulled away}} from the McLarens who <b>were</b> <b>pulling</b> away from the Ferraris (Prost had by now passed Alesi). On lap 18, Patrese waved Mansell through and decided to follow him. The McLarens stopped first and Senna got ahead of Berger. When Mansell stopped on lap 29, his crew had trouble fixing the wheelnut of his right rear properly. As the Williams {{mechanic}} went to get a spare nut, the lollipop man, unaware of the trouble signalled for Mansell to depart. Immediately, his right rear fell off and he stopped {{in the middle of the}} pitlane. The team retrieved the tyre, fixed it on Mansell's car and sent him on his way but he had dropped to 17th.|$|E
25|$|A {{few years}} after {{arriving}} in London, Starkey began to suffer from his own success. A variety of projects, from the manufacture of perfumes and pharmaceuticals {{to the production of}} sophic mercuries, <b>were</b> <b>pulling</b> him in different directions, straining professional relationships, and failed to generate sufficient income. The cost to personally fund these projects was leaving him financially unstable as debts increased. Finally, in 1653–1654, Starkey's creditors caught up with him. He was imprisoned twice for debt, and when not in prison, he avoided creditors by concealing his whereabouts. To make matters worse, he had lost the support of the Hartlib circle. It was necessary that a beleaguered Starkey reestablish his financial footing, restore his reputation, and attract new patronage.|$|E

25|$|Iver Johnson made {{an unusual}} model from 1940 to 1947, called the Trigger Cocking Double Action. If the hammer <b>was</b> down, <b>pulling</b> the trigger would cock the hammer.

This meant that {{to fire the}} {{revolver}} from a hammer down state, the trigger must <b>be</b> <b>pulled</b> twice.|$|R
25|$|Al Capone was {{the most}} notorious gangster of his generation. Born on January 17, 1899 in Brooklyn, New York; Capone settled in Chicago to take over Johnny Torrio's {{business}} dealing with outlawed liquor. Within three years, Capone had nearly 700 men at his disposal. As the profits came in, Capone acquired finesse—particularly {{in the management of}} politicians. By the middle of the decade, he had gained control of the suburb of Cicero, and had installed his own mayor. Capone's rise to fame did not come without bloodshed. Rival gangs, such as the Gennas and the Aiellos, started wars with Capone, eventually leading to a rash of killings. In 1927, Capone and his gang <b>were</b> <b>pulling</b> in approximately $60 million per year—most of it from beer. Capone not only controlled the sale of liquor to over 10,000 speakeasies, but he also controlled the supply from Canada to Florida. Capone was imprisoned in 1929 for tax violations and died January 25, 1947, from a heart attack, pneumonia, and syphilis.|$|E
25|$|On September 11, 2001, {{the station}} was shut down by the Port Authority after the first {{airplane}} hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center. In the minutes after the first plane hit at 8:46am, three PATH trains <b>were</b> <b>pulling</b> into the station. One was arriving from Newark and two others from Hoboken. The first Hoboken train turned around without stopping, not letting off passengers or opening any doors. The second Hoboken train arrived on track 3 at 8:52 a.m., was ordered to be evacuated, employees included. This train never left the World Trade Center complex and was found later in 2001 during the long recovery process. The train from Newark that came into the terminal at 8:55 a.m. stopped only to pick up passengers. An empty train {{was sent to the}} station at 9:10 a.m. to pick up a dozen PATH employees and a homeless individual, leaving the station empty.|$|E
25|$|The {{surface of}} the Earth is a {{rotating}} reference frame. To solve classical mechanics problems exactly in an Earth-bound reference frame, three fictitious forces must be introduced: the Coriolis force, the centrifugal force (described below) and the Euler force. The Euler force is typically ignored because the variations in the angular velocity of the rotating Earth surface are usually insignificant. Both of the other fictitious forces are weak compared to most typical forces in everyday life, {{but they can be}} detected under careful conditions. For example, Léon Foucault was able to show that the Coriolis force results from the Earth's rotation using the Foucault pendulum. If the Earth were to maintain its current shape but rotate twenty times faster (making each day only ~72 minutes long), people could easily get the impression that such fictitious forces <b>were</b> <b>pulling</b> on them, as on a spinning carousel--those in temperate and tropical latitudes would, in fact, need to hold on in order to avoid being launched into orbit by the centrifugal force.|$|E
50|$|In 1974, Hurricanes Kirsten and Ione interacted in a Fujiwara interaction, as Ione <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> north east, while Kirsten <b>was</b> <b>pulled</b> to {{the north}} west. In the same year,Francesca and Gretchen interacted with each other, until they merged on July 19.|$|R
