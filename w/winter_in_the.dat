5|$|Its winter range {{includes}} southern Canada {{and stretches}} south through the United States {{to parts of}} Mexico. In <b>winter,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern part of its range, the finch may move nearer to feeders if they are available. In southern ranges, during winter, they remain in areas similar to the fields and flood plains where they live during the summer months.|$|E
5|$|Like other snakes, it {{may fall}} prey to raptors, {{especially}} different species of snake eagles that migrate to Africa when it is <b>winter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Northern Hemisphere. The short-toed snake eagle (Circaetus gallicus) may be a particular threat, as it is almost strictly an ophiophagus raptor. Other snakes also prey on this species.|$|E
5|$|T. m. syriacus breeds on the Mediterranean {{coast of}} {{southern}} Turkey south to Jordan, Israel {{and the northern}} Sinai. It is mostly resident, {{but part of the}} population moves south west or west to <b>winter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Jordan Valley and in the Nile Delta of northern Egypt south to about Cairo. Both sexes of this subspecies are darker and greyer than the equivalent merula plumages.|$|E
50|$|Its climate tends toward hot {{summers and}} mild short <b>winters</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> low-lying areas, with cool <b>winters</b> {{dominating}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mountain areas.

5|$|The corn crake {{is a long}} {{distance}} migrant, breeding across temperate Eurasia from the British Isles east to central Siberia and western China. It winters in Africa from Zaire and central Tanzania south to eastern South Africa, mainly KwaZulu-Natal and the former Transvaal Province. Small numbers of birds may <b>winter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> milder areas of western Europe, or halt their migration and stay in North Africa.|$|E
5|$|The hatchling's {{ability to}} survive <b>winter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nest has allowed the painted turtle to extend its range further north than any other American turtle. The painted turtle is genetically adapted to survive {{extended}} periods of subfreezing temperatures with blood that can remain supercooled and skin that resists penetration from ice crystals in the surrounding ground. The hardest freezes nevertheless kill many hatchlings.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} the <b>winter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mexican League, Hodge {{was named to}} the Oklahoma City 89ers as a player-coach for the 1973 season. After serving as a coach for Oklahoma City in 1974 and the San Jose Bees in 1975, Hodge was named manager of the San Jose team for the 1976 season. The Bees went 4595 that year, and Hodge was fired at season's end. In 1981, he was named manager of the Waterloo Indians. The team went 8155 in his first season, and he was named Manager of the Year for the Midwest League. He served as manager for three more seasons, leading the team to records of 7564, 7664, and 6574, then was named as the Indians' traveling minor league hitting instructor for the 1985 season.|$|E

5|$|After the Canadian {{government}} withdrew promised {{financial support}} for the expedition, the delay in finding replacement funding ate into the Arctic sailing season. Shackleton, not wanting to delay departure any longer than he had to, decided to go south instead and attempt a circumnavigation of the Antarctic continent. The expedition, known as the Shackleton–Rowett Expedition (John Rowett, {{an old friend of}} Shackleton's, was the main sponsor), would also attempt to discover sub-Antarctic islands and spend the southern <b>winter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific islands. The expedition included several Endurance veterans in addition to Worsley; Frank Wild was again second in command, and Leonard Hussey was the meteorologist. Worsley was the master of the Quest, but would also be the expedition's hydrographer.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Turner {{appeared}} {{in her first}} Technicolor film, as Lady de <b>Winter</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Three Musketeers, opposite Gene Kelly, Van Heflin, and June Allyson. In November 1947, she agreed to do the film, thereby giving up an unfinished film project called Bedeviled. However, in January 1948, {{it was reported that}} she had withdrawn from the film. Initially, Louis B. Mayer gave her permission for doing so because of her schedule, but she was later that month put on suspension. Eventually, Turner agreed to make the film, but did not start production until March due to having to lose weight.|$|E
5|$|Medieval {{construction}} was seasonal, work on site being undertaken {{only in the}} spring and summer, when the light was good and the weather more reliable. Each autumn, all exposed surfaces were covered and lagged against frost damage. The architects worked over <b>winter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tracing house (that of York has both a fireplace and a privy) to prepare designs for the next season's campaign. They translated the designs into sets of planed oak cross-sectional templates, which were given to the stone-cutters. Construction of cathedrals and major churches almost invariably started at the eastern arm, and then proceeded westwards, with towers erected last.|$|E

5|$|Spending {{the autumn}} and <b>winter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open ocean {{of the cold}} {{northern}} seas, the Atlantic puffin returns to coastal areas {{at the start of}} the breeding season in late spring. It nests in clifftop colonies, digging a burrow in which a single white egg is laid. The chick mostly feeds on whole fish and grows rapidly. After about six weeks it is fully fledged and makes its way at night to the sea. It swims away from the shore and does not return to land for several years.|$|E
5|$|The Ashbridge {{family were}} English Quakers {{who lived in}} Chester County, Pennsylvania in the mid-18th century. Jonathan Ashbridge had been disowned by the Chester Meeting some time after the American Revolutionary War and died in Pennsylvania in 1782. Jonathan's wife, Sarah, arrived in Upper Canada in 1793 with her two sons, John and Jonathan, three of her daughters, and their families. Folklore {{suggests}} they spent their first <b>winter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ruins of the old French fort, Fort Rouillé, near present-day Fort York.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} habitat includes alkaline marshes, acid bogs, lakes, ponds, rivers, marshes, brackish {{marshes and}} {{the margins of}} estuaries and other aquatic environments in northern Saskatchewan, Manitoba, across Ontario, Quebec {{as well as the}} Atlantic Canadian Provinces, Great Lakes and the Adirondacks in the United States. It is partially migratory, and many <b>winter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east-central United States, especially coastal areas; some remain year-round in the Great Lakes region. This duck is a rare vagrant to Great Britain and Ireland, where over the years several birds have settled in and bred with the local mallard. The resulting hybrid can present considerable identification difficulties.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} {{season the}} Thistles won the Stirling Cup as champions of western Canada, which allowed {{them the right}} to challenge for the Cup again. However there was an early spring that year, and with natural ice used at the time, the series had to wait until the following <b>winter.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1907 season, he led the league in both goals and points, with eighteen. In the Thistles' successful Stanley Cup challenge against the Montreal Wanderers in January 1907, he scored all four goals in the Thistles' 4–2 victory and three in the second game, a 6–5 victory. The team would lose the Cup in a challenge series to the Wanderers two months later. In the two series, Phillips' nine goals, nine points and sixteen penalty minutes were all leaders in those categories.|$|E
5|$|The peace {{lasted until}} the end of the Muslim civil war in 661, from which Mu'awiya and his clan emerged victorious, {{establishing}} the Umayyad Caliphate. From the next year, Muslim attacks recommenced, with pressure mounting as Muslim armies began wintering on Byzantine soil west of the Taurus range, maximizing the disruption caused to the Byzantine economy. These land expeditions were sometimes coupled with naval raids against the coasts of southern Asia Minor. In 668, the Arabs sent aid to Saborios, strategos of the Armeniac Theme, who had rebelled and proclaimed himself emperor. The Arab troops under Fadhala ibn 'Ubayd arrived too late to assist Saborios, who had died after falling from his horse, and they spent the <b>winter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hexapolis around Melitene awaiting reinforcements.|$|E

In New South Wales and Queensland, (in which NRL {{is the dominant}} football code), The Matty Johns Show was broadcast on Thursdays at 7.30pm, two hours before The Footy Show. In all other states (in which the Australian Football League predominates), The Matty Johns Show may have been broadcast Thursdays at 7.30pm, or broadcast around midnight, after The AFL Footy Show. When broadcast at 7.30pm, the show followed long-running soap opera Home and Away.|$|E

5|$|Tolerant of both {{heat and}} cold, it is grown in North America in United States Department of Agriculture {{hardiness}} zones three through nine, although some cultivars {{may be better}} suited than others to extremes of temperature. It is successfully grown from the southwestern United States, north and east {{across much of the}} country, and across the Canada–US border into Ontario and Quebec. In the coldest of these areas, it may require considerable protection to survive the <b>winter.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom, the Royal Horticultural Society has assigned it hardiness rating H4, indicating that it tolerates temperatures as low as , hardy in most of the country through typical winters.|$|E
5|$|Visitors {{are allowed}} to snowshoe and do {{cross-country}} skiing and are not restricted to trails. The Teton Park Road between the Taggart Lake trailhead to Signal Mountain Campground is closed to vehicular traffic during the winter and {{this section of the}} road is groomed for skiing and snowshoeing traffic. The park service offers guided snowshoe tours daily from the main headquarters located in Moose, Wyoming. Overnight camping is allowed in the <b>winter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> backcountry with a permit and visitors should inquire about avalanche dangers.|$|E
5|$|Common {{starlings}} in {{the south}} and west of Europe and south of latitude 40°N are mainly resident, although other populations migrate from regions where the winter is harsh, the ground frozen and food scarce. Large numbers of birds from northern Europe, Russia and Ukraine migrate south westwards or south eastwards. In the autumn, when immigrants are arriving from eastern Europe, many of Britain's common starlings are setting off for Iberia and North Africa. Other groups of birds are in passage across the country and the pathways of these different streams of bird may cross. Of the 15,000 birds ringed as nestlings in Merseyside, England, individuals have been recovered at various times of year as far afield as Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Germany and the Low Countries. Small numbers of common starling have sporadically been observed in Japan and Hong Kong but it is unclear from where these birds originated. In North America, northern populations have developed a migration pattern, vacating much of Canada in winter. Birds in the east of the country move southwards, and those from further west <b>winter</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southwest of the US.|$|E
