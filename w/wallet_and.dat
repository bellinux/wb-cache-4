25|$|A 2013 {{study by}} Oceana {{found that one}} third of seafood sampled from the United States was {{incorrectly}} labelled. Snapper and tuna were particularly susceptible to mislabelling, and seafood substitution {{was the most common}} type of fraud. These practices can harm both the consumers' <b>wallet</b> <b>and</b> pose health risks. Another type of mislabelling is short-weighting, where practices such as overglazing or soaking can misleadingly increase the apparent weight of the fish. The detection of water retention agents helps identify the fraud and its origin.|$|E
