5|$|After {{the start}} of the war with Japan, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed an order for {{internment}} of all the people of Japanese ancestry who lived on the West Coast. About 1,700of them lived in Portland, and some had farms or businesses near the slough. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> removed them from their homes in 1942, it housed them temporarily in the Livestock Exposition Center (Expo Center) in Kenton before sending them to internment camps further inland. They were not allowed to return until 1945.|$|E

5|$|Another {{public outcry}} arose <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>{{government}},</b> seeking {{the support of}} ethnic minorities, allowed the opening of over 80 Polish schools in Lithuania. At the time, the Polish government was closing Lithuanian schools in the fiercely contested Vilnius Region. The coalition government directly confronted the Christian Democrats when it proposed a 1927 budget that reduced salaries to the clergy and subsidies to Catholic schools. Further controversies were created when the government's military reform program was revealed as a careless downsizing. Some 200 conservative military officers were fired. The military began planning the coup.|$|E
5|$|Dar {{began his}} {{political}} career in the late 1980s with Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML (N)) {{as a member of}} its central executive committee.

5|$|Francesco {{became an}} {{official}} in Florence. He {{was elected to the}} Dodici Buonomini in 1499 and to the Signoria in 1512, where he was confirmed as a Priori in 1524.

40|$|A {{numerical}} example of privately issued money {{is used to}} illustrate the fiscal theory of the price level, and {{to show that the}} fiscal theory is best understood as a subset of the backing theory of money. Government issuance of money or debt is shown to be potentially inflationary only <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>government’s</b> net worth is negative, and <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>government’s</b> assets do not rise in step with its liabilities. The backing theory is used to examine whether inflation can be avoided by a sufficiently tough central bank, and to criticize the view that fiscal policies affect inflation through their wealth effects. ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>government’s</b> {{interest}} {{is only to}} arrest for a minor offense, that presumption of unreasonableness is difficult to rebut, and <b>the</b> <b>government</b> usually {{should be allowed to}} make such arrests only with a warrant issued upon probable cause by a neutral and detached magistrate.|$|R
5|$|In Bergen {{the company}} {{established}} Hotel Terminus Bergen {{along with other}} investors, but the hotel failed to make money. In the late 1940s the company bought Grand Hotell Bellevue in Ålesund, and later operated Saltfjellet Tourist Hotel for a short period. In 1952, Oslo Municipality's Viking Hotel was completed, and Spisevognselskapet {{was selected as the}} operator. It remained the hotel's operator until 1976 <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> sold it to Eiendomsinvest, which outbid Spisevognselskapet by several million krone.|$|E
5|$|Life in Nelson {{remained}} {{difficult for}} Heaphy, who had by now lost his appetite for exploration. He eked {{out a living}} taking occasional jobs {{for the next six}} months. For much of 1847, he undertook survey work around Tasman Bay and later in that year was the representative of the New Zealand Company, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> investigated the amount of land set aside by the company for the local Māori. Work had dried up by early 1848 and when he was offered employment with the Auckland Survey Office in April 1848, he accepted.|$|E
5|$|Rojhaz: Virginia's blonde-haired, blue-eyed Native American bodyguard, who {{in fact is}} a {{displaced}} Captain America from a dystopian future. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> of {{his time}} captured him and attempted to execute him using advanced technology, he was accidentally sent back in time - the event which triggered the alternate timeline to begin with - thus forming the paradox of the story.|$|E
50|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>government's</b> {{topographical}} department needed a special {{survey of the}} Wahleach Mountain area, he was prepared. The operation was a complete success and his techniques for high altitude landings and takeoffs from hitherto inaccessible locations, became the accepted worldwide standard.|$|R
5000|$|Tombalbaye's initial {{response}} to the increasing antigovernment activities was to attempt to crush them. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>government's</b> forces proved woefully inadequate for the task, Tombalbaye swallowed his pride and called in the French under provisions of military treaties signed in 1960.|$|R

5|$|Since 2012 Chad {{has been}} divided into 23 regions. The {{subdivision}} of Chad in regions came about in 2003 {{as part of}} the decentralisation process, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> abolished the previous 14 prefectures. Each region is headed by a presidentially appointed governor. Prefects administer the 61 departments within the regions. The departments are divided into 200 sub-prefectures, which are in turn composed of 446 cantons.|$|E
5|$|The Blathwayt {{family owned}} the house until 1956, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> {{acquired}} it, {{but during the}} Second World War it was used for child evacuees while rented by Lady Anne Islington, the wife of John Dickson-Poynder, 1st Baron Islington, who redecorated many of the rooms. The National Trust acquired it in 1961. In 2015 major renovation work, costing £3.8 million, included replacing the roof. Part of the cost was met from a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of £85,000. While the repairs were in progress, visitors could view the house from a rooftop walkway.|$|E
5|$|The German economy {{suffered}} severe setbacks {{after the}} end of World War I, partly because of reparations payments required under the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. The government printed money to make the payments and to repay the country's war debt, but the resulting hyperinflation led to inflated prices for consumer goods, economic chaos and food riots. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> failed to make the reparations payments in January 1923, French troops occupied German industrial areas along the Ruhr and widespread civil unrest followed.|$|E

5|$|The inner or core cabinet (the prime {{minister}} and the PM's deputies) monitors and discusses {{the operation of the}} government, and may hold preliminary discussions on any matter performed by the government. The core cabinet may act as the government in emergencies <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> is unable to meet; however, its decisions must be verified at the next government session to remain in force. The Government Secretary coordinates agencies, offices and other services subordinated to the government.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} made {{possible}} <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> introduced the Trade Facilities Act, 1921 by which the Treasury underwrote loans for public works {{as a means of}} alleviating unemployment. With this support, the UERL raised the funds and work began on extending the Hampstead tube to Edgware.

5|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> withdrew Mitchell, the McCanns hired Justine McGuinness, who was {{reportedly}} headhunted for the job. When she left, Hanover Communications took over briefly, headed by Charles Lewington, formerly John Major's private secretary.

Mitchell resigned from his government position and started working for the McCanns full-time; he was later paid by Madeleine's Fund.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{struggle}} {{began in}} India <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> of India Act 1919 failed to satisfy demand for independence. Concerns over communist and foreign plots following the Ghadar Conspiracy ensured that war-time strictures were renewed by the Rowlatt Acts. This led to tension, {{particularly in the}} Punjab region, where repressive measures culminated in the Amritsar Massacre. In Britain public opinion was divided over the morality of the massacre, between those who saw it as having saved India from anarchy, and those who viewed it with revulsion. The subsequent Non-Co-Operation movement was called off in March 1922 following the Chauri Chaura incident, and discontent continued to simmer for the next 25 years.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} was signed with Amadeus in 2007 to upgrade Biman's ticketing system with an e-ticketing solution {{to comply with}} IATA rules, which set out a deadline of 31 December 2007 for all member airlines to switch over their ticketing systems. E-ticketing has enabled major airlines to provide online check-in facilities, reducing the need to queue up at check-in counters. However, Biman has not made any attempts to improve customer service through the adoption of e-ticketing, {{although it has been}} able to reduce its own costs. In 2005, Biman had briefly stopped using the Amadeus ticketing system <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> suspended the operation of a local Amadeus subsidiary following a court order, after allegations of money laundering. The suspension, however, lasted only a month, and was lifted after the writ was appealed in the High Court.|$|E
