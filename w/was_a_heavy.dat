5|$|Barker <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> smoker until 1972, {{when he gave}} up {{the habit}} after having a pre-cancerous growth removed from his throat; he took to {{drinking}} wine and using placebo cigarettes to maintain his concentration and help him sleep. He underwent a heart bypass in 1996 and survived a pulmonary embolism the following year.|$|E
5|$|For the {{majority}} of its operational lifetime, Loring <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> bomber, aerial refueling, and interception facility for military aircraft, equipment, and supplies first as part of Strategic Air Command (SAC) (1947–1992), then as part of the succeeding Air Combat Command (ACC) (1992–1994).|$|E
5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the contaminated spray was thrown back into the air as the base surge. Unlike the Wilson cloud, a meteorological phenomenon in clean air, the base surge <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> fog bank of radioactive mist that rolled across all the target ships, coating their surfaces with fission products. When the mist in the base surge evaporated, the base surge became invisible but continued to move away, contaminating ships several miles from the detonation point.|$|E

5|$|Compensation {{for large}} amounts of damage to houses along the route during {{construction}}, along with higher construction costs than calculated <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> burden on the company, and in 1934, the municipality of Aker took over the common stock, though the preferred stock remained listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange until 1975, as Oslo Sporveier gradually took over {{the operation of the}} western suburban lines. Akersbanerne opened the connecting Sognsvann Line in 1934.|$|E
5|$|Fleming {{was married}} to Ann Charteris, who was {{divorced}} from the second Viscount Rothermere because of her affair with the author. Fleming and Charteris had a son, Caspar. Fleming <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> smoker and drinker {{for most of his}} life and succumbed to heart disease in 1964 at the age of 56. Two of his James Bond books were published posthumously; other writers have since produced Bond novels. Fleming's creation has appeared in film twenty-six times, portrayed by seven actors.|$|E
5|$|However, Brazil's {{champion}} {{in the fight for}} the abolition of slavery was dying. While in Europe, the first symptoms of mouth cancer appeared. Rio Branco <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> smoker, and he would daily smoke up to thirty Cuban cigars specially imported for him from Havana. Until July 1880, he was still making appearances in Parliament to deliver speeches, but after that date he no longer attended. Rio Branco still kept a close watch on political developments, however, and continued to appear at meetings of the Council of State. He had already retired from teaching in 1877.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, an Australian-based company OnTilt Designs Pty Ltd won a multi-year {{contract}} {{to become the}} official bracelet manufacturer for the WSOP. OnTilt jewelers decided that the 2010 bracelet design {{would return to the}} tradition of the 1970s and 1980s where the bracelet <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> piece of unadorned metal. American jewelry designer Steve Soffa was chosen to design and manufacture the entire set of bracelets. The goal was to create a bracelet that somebody would actually want to wear every day. In 2011, OnTilt has also been chosen to manufacture the WSOP Circuit rings.|$|E
5|$|In Cairo, a {{standoff}} {{took place in}} front of the Egyptian Museum {{in the early morning hours}} with rocks and petrol bombs reportedly flying. Large-caliber shots were reportedly fired in the air by the army to keep opposing factions at bay. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> police presence at the museum following the standoff. Anti-government protesters banged on metal railings while rocks were thrown at them.|$|E
5|$|On June 23, 1331, a fire {{broke out}} toward the left bank of the Ponte Vecchio bridge, {{destroying}} all twenty shops located on the bridge. Villani notes that this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> loss to local craftsmen of Florence, while two craftsman apprentices died in the fire. On September 12 of that same year a {{fire broke out}} at the household of the Soldanieri, killing six people in a house of carpenters and a blacksmith that was located near the church of Santa Trinità.|$|E

5|$|Quest left South Georgia on 18 January, heading {{south-east}} {{towards the}} South Sandwich Islands. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> swell, {{such that the}} overladen ship frequently dipped its gunwales below the waves, filling the waist with water. As they proceeded, Wild wrote that Quest rolled like a log, leaked and required regular pumping, was heavy on coal consumption, and was slow. All these factors led him to change his plan {{at the end of}} January. Bouvet Island was abandoned in favour of a more southerly course that brought them {{to the edge of the}} pack ice on 4 February.|$|E
5|$|Seydlitz <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> cruiser of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine, {{fourth in}} the , but was never completed. The ship was laid down in December 1936 and {{launched}} in January 1939, but the outbreak of World War II slowed her construction and fitting-out work was finally stopped {{in the summer of}} 1940 when she was approximately 95percent complete. The unfinished ship remained pier-side in the shipyard until March 1942, when the Kriegsmarine decided to pursue aircraft carriers over surface combatants. Seydlitz was among the vessels chosen for conversion into auxiliary aircraft carriers.|$|E
5|$|Stella met Bruce Nickell in 1974. Nickell <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> {{equipment}} operator with {{a drinking}} habit, which suited Stella's lifestyle, {{and the two}} were married in 1976. In {{the course of their}} ten-year marriage, Bruce Nickell entered rehab and gave up drinking. Reportedly, Stella resented this. Her bar visits were curtailed by Bruce's sobriety, and Stella cultivated a home aquarium as a new hobby.|$|E

5|$|The English Civil War {{affected}} all of England; even {{families were}} split over Royalist or Parliamentarian loyalties. Little is recorded over the divisions within Hale Barns, but Hale and Hale Barns did {{emerge from the}} Civil War more or less untouched by events– though there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> tax to pay to support the Parliamentarian army they avoided much of the requisitioning of supplies and animals for passing armies. None of the Royalists in Hale and Hale Barns had their lands confiscated or was forced to pay fines.|$|E
5|$|The hookbill's {{distinguishing}} characteristic <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy,</b> parrotlike bill. The {{upper mandible}} hooked sharply downwards, while the heavy lower mandible hooked sharply upwards towards {{the middle of}} the upper mandible. This structure left a gap between the two mandibles when the bird held its beak closed. It is believed that the bill was pale pink in coloration. The jaw muscles were particularly well developed around the bill. The hookbill's tongue was primitive and nontubular.|$|E
5|$|Zeus had {{initially}} been proposed {{in an era}} when ICBMs were extremely expensive and the Soviet fleet was thought to contain a few dozen missiles. At a time when the US deterrent fleet was based entirely on manned bombers, even a small number of missiles aimed at Strategic Air Command's (SAC) bases presented a serious threat. Two Zeus deployment plans were outlined. One <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> defensive system that would provide protection over the entire continental United States, but require as many as 7000 Zeus missiles. McNamara supported a much lighter system that would use only 1200 missiles.|$|E

5|$|After her coronation, Anne {{settled into}} a quiet routine at the King's {{favourite}} residence, Greenwich Palace, {{to prepare for the}} birth of her baby. The child was born slightly prematurely on 7 September 1533. Between three and four in the afternoon, Anne gave birth to a girl, who was christened Elizabeth, probably in honour of either or both Anne's mother Elizabeth Howard and Henry's mother, Elizabeth of York. But the birth of a girl <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> blow to her parents, since they had confidently expected a boy. All but one of the royal physicians and astrologers had predicted a son for them and the French king had already been asked to stand as his godfather. Now the prepared letters announcing the birth of a prince had an s hastily added to them to read princes and the traditional jousting tournament for the birth of an heir was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war Norsk Hydro had {{a strong}} liquidity, while the Green Revolution and {{increased}} industrialization of agriculture in Europe boomed the demand for the products; from 1945 to 1955 production increased eightfold. The increased transport <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> burden on the two steamships, and in 1953 Norsk Transport ordered MF Storegut, a diesel powered ship of 1119 gross tonnes. She was launched on 25 May 1956, and the two older ferries were put to reserve duty in the meantime. A number of upgrades were made to the line, and the two locomotives 9 and 10 were bought in 1958. This was followed by the three diesel locomotives 20, 21 and 22 from Henschel. In 1966 two NSB El 1 locomotives were bought, and the voltage on the line increased from 10 to 15 kV.|$|E
5|$|As {{the summit}} closed on 28 September 1970, hours after escorting the last Arab leader to leave, Nasser {{suffered}} a heart attack. He was immediately transported to his house, where his physicians tended to him. Nasser died several hours later, around 6:00p.m. Heikal, Sadat, and Nasser's wife Tahia were at his deathbed. According to his doctor, al-Sawi Habibi, Nasser's likely {{cause of death was}} arteriosclerosis, varicose veins, and complications from long-standing diabetes. Nasser <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> smoker with a family history of heart disease—two of his brothers died in their fifties from the same condition. The state of Nasser's health was not known to the public prior to his death. He had previously suffered heart attacks in 1966 and September 1969.|$|E
