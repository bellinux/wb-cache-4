5|$|A general {{perception}} on Narayan <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{not involve}} himself or his writings with the politics or problems of India, as mentioned by V. S. Naipaul {{in one of}} his columns. However, according to Wyatt Mason of The New Yorker, although Narayan's writings seem simple and display a lack of interest in politics, he delivers his narrative with an artful and deceptive technique when dealing with such subjects and does not entirely avoid them, rather letting the words play in the reader's mind. Srinivasa Iyengar, former vice-chancellor of Andhra University, says that Narayan wrote about political topics only in the context of his subjects, quite unlike his compatriot Mulk Raj Anand who dealt with the political structures and problems of the time. Paul Brians, in his book Modern South Asian Literature in English, says that the fact that Narayan completely ignored British rule and focused on the private lives of his characters is a political statement on its own, declaring his independence from the influence of colonialism.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Episode I in 2002, the Xenosaga project was reevaluated and staff reshuffled to allow newer staff members a chance to handle the series. Series creator and Monolith Soft co-founder Tetsuya Takahashi stepped down as director, taking on other {{responsibilities}} within the company {{in addition to being}} given wider creative input on projects. Takahashi's explanation <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not want to limit the scope and direction of the Xenosaga series, and that his style of direction as seen for Episode I could result in the development period becoming extended exponentially. During this period the Xenosaga series, originally planned by Takahashi as a six-part series, was rearranged into a trilogy, with the possibility of further episodes should the series meet continued success. The new director was Koh Arai, while Tomohiro Hagiwara became lead producer, both of whom had worked on Episode I in minor roles; Takahashi on an executive role overseeing Episode II, in addition to keeping the staff informed with the lore of Xenosaga.|$|E

He also took 18 wickets at 47.11. The only downside to his season <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not break into the one-day side, with incumbent Xavier Doherty being Tasmania's sole spin bowler in the one-day arena. He played only one game, and was named 12th man in Tasmania's competition victory against Victoria.|$|E

25|$|Seleucus, however, did {{not manage}} to enlarge his kingdom to the west. The main reason <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{not have enough}} Greek and Macedonian troops. During the battle of Ipsus, he had less {{infantry}} than Lysimachus. His strength was in his war elephants and in traditional Persian cavalry. In order to enlarge his army, Seleucus tried to attract colonists from mainland Greece by founding four new cities—Seleucia Pieria and Laodicea in Syria on the coast and Antioch on the Orontes and Apameia in the Orontes River valley. Antioch became his chief seat of government. The new Seleucia was supposed to become his new naval base and a gateway to the Mediterranean. Seleucus also founded six smaller cities.|$|E
25|$|While Livingstone had a {{great impact}} on British Imperialism, he did so at a {{tremendous}} cost to his family. In his absences, his children grew up missing their father, and his wife Mary (daughter of Mary and Robert Moffat), whom he wed in 1845, endured very poor health, and died of malaria on 27 April 1862 trying to follow him in Africa. He had six children: Robert reportedly died in the American Civil War; Agnes (b. 1847), Thomas, Elizabeth (who died at two months), William Oswell (nicknamed Zouga because of the river along which he was born, in 1851) and Anna Mary (b. 1858). Only Agnes, William Oswell and Anna Mary married and had children. His one regret in later life <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not spend enough time with his children.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{lost the}} 1972 World Cup Final to Great Britain in {{controversial}} circumstances. Australian captain Graeme Langlands was denied {{what seemed a}} fair try by being ruled offside by the French referee after catching a kick put up by halfback Dennis Ward. Television footage of the try showed Langlands was approximately a metre behind Ward when he kicked the ball. The French referee Georges Jameau's alleged reason for not awarding the try <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not believe anyone could have scored it from an onside position. The World Cup final was tied at 10–10 after full-time and was still locked after extra time. Great Britain were awarded the victory due to a higher points table placing after the pool rounds of the competition. The Final was also highlighted by an 80-metre try to Lions captain, winger Clive Sullivan.|$|E

25|$|Solano López {{would have}} done well to heed his father's last words to avoid {{aggressive}} acts in foreign affairs, especially with Brazil. Francisco's foreign policy vastly underestimated Paraguay's neighbors and overrated Paraguay's potential as a military power. Solano López's basic failing <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not recognize the changes that had occurred in the region since Francia's time. Under his father's rule, the protracted, bloody, and distracting birth pangs of Argentina and Uruguay, the bellicose policies of Brazil, and Francia's noninterventionist policies had worked in conjunction with one another to preserve Paraguayan independence. Matters had settled down since then in both Argentina and Brazil, as both countries had become surer of their identities and more united internally. Argentina, for example, began reacting to foreign challenges as a nation rather than an assortment of squabbling regions, as Paraguayans had grown to expect. Solano López's attempt to leverage Paraguay's emergence as a regional power equal to Argentina and Brazil had disastrous consequences.|$|E
25|$|In retrospect, Ellsworth's role {{in helping}} to {{establish}} the United States as a viable sovereign nation was important but could be easily overlooked. A {{good part of the}} reason for this <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not distinguish himself as an orator but worked as much as possible behind the scenes. He was said to have been dominant in his eloquence at the January 1788, Connecticut Ratifying Convention, but later as the de facto Senate majority leader he seems to have kept his arguments relatively short and to the point. His written prose could on occasion be tortuous, as best illustrated by the operative sentence in Section 25 of the Judiciary Act (the first of only two sentences). Over three hundred words long, this sentence is almost impossible to decipher as an explanation how state courts were answerable to federal authority. But perhaps this opacity was intentional, since the expansion of federal power specified by Section 25 was mostly overlooked in debate both in the Senate and House of Representatives despite having been the most important and potentially controversial portion of the Judiciary Act.|$|E
25|$|Görgei was so {{angered by}} the partial failure of that days {{military}} actions (although the Hungarian advancement, they could not breach the enemy lines, deciding {{the fate of the}} battle), that he dismissed Knezić from the lead of the III. corps because of his passivity, but also Asbóth from the lead of the II. corps, although he was the only corps commander, who accomplished his tasks. Allegedly Görgei was angered of him because his troops suffered too many losses during their attack. In their place were put: Colonel József Kászonyi in the lead of the II. corps, and Colonel Károly Leiningen-Westerburg in the lead of the III. corps. While Leiningen will demonstrate to be an excellent choice, Kászonyi's appointment in the place of Asbóth, will show to be an unlucky choice. To change the corps commanders {{in the middle of a}} battle, was also a bad decision, but maybe the worst thing <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not kept under a direct control and observation his corps commanders - especially the hesitating Knezić - in order to make them to move in the right moment to the battlefield. He chose to be on the battlefield to encourage his soldiers and officers, task which he accomplished with great success, turning many times the tides of the battle with his presence, personal example and words of encouragement.|$|E

His mind was made up and he knew he was going to retire. His wife, Nessie, had asked him to retire a year earlier but he decided that was not the right time. Tommy Smith said that Shankly's feelings for Nessie were undoubtedly a major reason for his decision. In 1974, he decided that he could leave Liverpool with pride in a job well done and only one regret, which <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not win the European Cup.|$|E

[...] According to Selman, Hawking was very humble regarding the episode's jokes about him, and stated that he [...] "took a lot of shots" [...] at himself.

500|$|The {{conflicts}} between Welles and Ritt attracted media attention. Immediately after filming was completed, {{during an interview}} with Life, Welles explained {{that the cause of}} his behavior <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not know what kind of [...] "monkeyshines" [...] his co-stars would be or the [...] "caprices" [...] they would receive from him. He also stated that they overcame the differences and completed the film. [...] Welles later wrote a letter to Ritt praising his work and apologizing for his interference during the making of the movie. Ritt replied, expounding his admiration for Welles. Despite the mutual apologies, during an interview in 1965, Ritt recalled an incident on the set. While the film was being shot, it was often stopped by bad weather. During a day suitable for shooting, he found Welles not ready for the scene, instead reading a newspaper in Spanish. Ritt decided to skip Welles' scene and shoot the next one. He attributed Welles' later cooperation to the incident, which Welles had found humiliating. [...] Ritt thus earned the nickname [...] "the Orson Tamer" [...] throughout the Hollywood community.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Human Nature" [...] {{was directed by}} Jean-Baptiste Mondino, who had previously directed Madonna's videos for [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] and [...] "Justify My Love". It was shot over two days, May 6 to 7, 1995 at Raleigh Studios in Hollywood, California and was created under Palomar Productions' Anita Wetterstedt. The video was choreographed by Jamie King, who later directed Madonna's concert tours. [...] "She wanted me to dance in her 'Human Nature' video. I didn't want to do it, but she begged", he stated. King {{was one of the}} dancers in the S attires hanging down from a swinging trapeze in the video. Her dancer Luca Tommassini was the choreography assistant. Madonna's main inspiration behind the video was the work of artist Eric Stanton who did S inspired drawings. The singer enlisted Mondino to direct the video and wanted to be about the fun aspects of Stanton's work and more dance-oriented than her previous videos from Bedtime Stories. For Mondino, the main problem <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not prefer too much dancing in the videos, because that resulted in extra editing.|$|E
500|$|On 3 May 1943, {{while on}} an aerial {{inspection}} tour, Lieutenant General Frank M. Andrews, European Theater of Operations, United States Army (ETOUSA) commander since replacing Eisenhower on 5 February 1943, {{was killed in}} an aircraft crash in Iceland. Marshall appointed Devers to take command of ETOUSA in his place. Devers arrived in England on 9 May 1943. His principal tasks were overseeing preparation of detailed plans and the buildup of men and materiel for Operation Overlord, and supporting the Combined Bomber Offensive. At the end of May 1943, there were 133,000 US troops in the United Kingdom, of which 19,000 were in the ground forces, 74,000 in the air forces, and 34,000 in the services of supply. By the end of the year, their numbers had grown to 774,000, of which 265,000 were in the ground forces, 286,000 in the air forces, and 220,000 in the services of supply. In preparing the plans for Overlord, he worked closely with the chief of staff to the Supreme Allied Commander (COSSAC), British Lieutenant General [...] Frederick E. Morgan, with whom he had a good working relationship. Devers' main objection to the COSSAC plan <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not want American units smaller than corps directly subordinated to British command, based on what he called [...] "the Pershing Principle".|$|E

500|$|Gershkovitch, {{known for}} his {{discipline}} and high performance standards, conducted the orchestra for twenty-nine years, gaining national attention for the ensemble and pioneering the youth orchestra movement. By the 1930s, PJS concerts were broadcast nationally on the CBS Radio Network. In 1956 and 1958 both NBC and CBS transmitted broadcasts of the orchestra's programs across the United States, and three transcribed programs were broadcast overseas from Voice of America in Washington, D.C. Gershkovitch was also responsible for adding a Preparatory Orchestra (later renamed the Conservatory Orchestra) due to increased membership. He tried to incorporate at least one American composition in each concert. Gershkovitch had a distinctive personality and a unique way with words, using expressions such as [...] "More nicely, can't you more?" [...] and [...] "Debussy is beauty, French beauty" [...] (as recollected in one former student's diary). For twenty-five years, David Campbell served as Master of Ceremonies for the Children's Concerts since Gershkovitch [...] "never gained a command of English sufficient enough for public use". Gershkovitch's often-quoted philosophy <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> [...] "not teach music", but rather he taught [...] "young people through music". Though there were times he desired to conduct professional ensembles, Gershkovitch's primary concern was educating the youth. Apart from music education, he {{stressed the importance of}} proper conduct, manners, and [...] "values in life and art" [...] in order to build character. Following Gershkovitch's death in 1953, guest conductors led the orchestra for its thirtieth season– one conductor was Jacob Avshalomov, a Columbia University teacher and PJS alumnus who had studied under Gershkovitch while a student at Reed College (1939–1941).|$|E
500|$|Madness {{frequently}} discovers itself {{merely by}} unnecessary {{deviation from the}} usual mode of the world. My poor friend Smart shewed the disturbance of his mind, by falling upon his knees, and saying his prayers in the street, {{or in any other}} unusual place. Now although, rationally speaking, it is greater madness not to pray at all, than to pray as Smart did, I am afraid there are so many who do not pray, that their understanding is not called in question.Concerning this unfortunate poet, Christopher Smart, who was confined in a mad-house, he had, at another time, the following conversation with Dr [...] Burney:– Burney. 'How does poor Smart do, Sir; is he likely to recover?' Johnson. 'It seems as if his mind had ceased to struggle with the disease; for he grows fat upon it.' Burney. 'Perhaps, Sir, that may be from want of exercise.' Johnson. 'No, Sir; he has partly as much exercise as he used to have, for he digs in the garden. Indeed, before his confinement, he used for exercise to walk to the ale-house; but he was carried back again. I did not think he ought to be shut up. His infirmities are not noxious to society. He insisted on people praying with him; and I'd as lief pray with Kit [...] Smart as any one else. Another charge <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not love clean linen; and I have no passion for it.'– Johnson continued.
