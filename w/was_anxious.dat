5|$|By March 1905, Potter <b>was</b> <b>anxious</b> {{to begin}} work on the tale. She thought the 1903 version too thin and rewrote the entire story, {{retaining}} Ribby the cat and Duchess the dog as the central characters while elaborating the setting and developing a stronger plot line. It was decided the tale would be published in a format slightly larger than her previous productions with ten full-colour illustrations and other illustrations in pen and sepia ink.|$|E
5|$|For a time, Duyệt's {{attitude}} and stature {{in the south}} forced Minh Mạng to moderate his policies and allow the preaching of Christian missionaries. However, it also increased {{the tension between the}} pair and Minh Mạng <b>was</b> <b>anxious</b> to curtail the autonomy that his father had granted to Duyệt and the southerners. The emperor began to slowly wind back their military powers, in an attempt to wear down Duyệt's power base by gradually removing the general's close aides.|$|E

5|$|The Hastings line {{is built}} over the difficult, forested, and hilly terrain across the High Weald and {{sandstone}} Hastings Beds, necessitating the construction of eight tunnels between Tonbridge and the south coast seaside resort of Hastings. The SER <b>was</b> <b>anxious</b> to construct the line as economically as possible, since it was in competition with the LBSC to obtain entry into Hastings and {{was not in a}} strong financial position in the mid 1840s.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 1889–90 Australian season, Trumble {{endured a}} period where {{he was not able}} to take wickets consistently. With {{selection}} of the Australian team to tour England in 1890 due at this time, Trumble <b>was</b> <b>anxious</b> about this poor run of form. Noting his anxiety while playing, a friend offered him a beer during the lunch break to revive his spirits. Previously a teetotaler, Trumble enjoyed his first taste and ordered another before re-entering the field of play. Feeling relaxed, although wondering about his steadiness of step, Trumble took a succession of wickets to ensure his selection in the Australian team. Trumble finished the season with 27wickets at an average of 14.20 per wicket.|$|E
5|$|From April to September 1982, the Queen <b>was</b> <b>anxious</b> but {{proud of}} her son, Prince Andrew, who was serving with British forces during the Falklands War. On 9 July, the Queen awoke in her bedroom at Buckingham Palace to find an intruder, Michael Fagan, {{in the room with}} her. In a serious lapse of security, {{assistance}} only arrived after two calls to the Palace police switchboard. After hosting US President Ronald Reagan at Windsor Castle in 1982 and visiting his California ranch in 1983, the Queen was angered when his administration ordered the invasion of Grenada, one of her Caribbean realms, without informing her.|$|E

5|$|He was {{assigned}} to a civil flying school at RAF Prestwick which was run by Scottish Aviation Limited. He formally began his training on 29 June 1936. He progressed well in his theory examinations, gaining 99 percent for gunnery and 91 percent for airmanship. He flew a single-engined De Havilland Tiger Moth training biplane and gained his A Licence {{at the end of}} July, partly because he was a capable pilot and also because the Air Ministry <b>was</b> <b>anxious</b> to produce trained pilots. He completed his training within two months and was classified as above average after passing his examination with ease.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius {{was long}} remembered favourably in the Western church for his reputed feat in {{recovering}} the True Cross, {{which had been}} captured by the Persians. As Heraclius approached the capital, Khosrau fled from his favourite residence, Dastagird near Baghdad, without offering resistance. Meanwhile, some of the Persian grandees freed Khosrau's eldest son Kavadh II, who had been imprisoned by his father, and proclaimed him King {{on the night of}} 23–24 February, 628. Kavadh however was mortally ill and <b>was</b> <b>anxious</b> that Heraclius should protect his infant son Ardeshir. So, as a goodwill gesture, he sent the True Cross with a negotiator to sue for peace in 628.|$|E
5|$|I {{asked him}} not {{to go into that}} field, that you were going there. He laughed at the idea of being {{restricted}} to any locality and said he intended to go whether I aided him or not. I <b>was</b> <b>anxious</b> to secure the cooperation of such a worker as an honor to my corps. I could not be responsible for the field he selected in as much as I pay him no salary and a portion of his expenses. You will see therefore that while it is not a pleasant thing to work in competition with others it seems almost a necessity. You can sympathize.|$|E

5000|$|If I <b>am</b> <b>anxious</b> about a past misfortune, {{then this}} is {{not because it is}} in the past but because it may be repeated, i.e., become future. If I <b>am</b> <b>anxious</b> because of a past offense, it is because I have not placed it in an {{essential}} relation to myself as past and have in some deceitful way prevented it from being past. If indeed it is actually past, then I cannot <b>be</b> <b>anxious</b> but only repentant. If I do not repent, I have allowed myself to make my relation to the offense dialectical, and by this the offense itself has become a possibility, and not something past. If I <b>am</b> <b>anxious</b> about the punishment, it is only because this has been placed in a dialectical relation to the offense (otherwise I suffer my punishment), and then I <b>am</b> <b>anxious</b> for the possible for the future. Thus we have returned to where we were in Chapter I. Anxiety is the psychological state that precedes sin. It approaches sin as closely as possible, as anxiously as possible, but without explaining sin, which breaks forth only in the qualitative leap.

5|$|In 1368, a Han Chinese revolt {{known as}} the Red Turban Rebellion toppled the Mongol Yuan dynasty in China. Zhu Yuanzhang then {{established}} the Ming dynasty, ruling as the Hongwu Emperor (r.1368–1398). It {{is not clear how}} much the early Ming court understood the civil war going on in Tibet between rival religious sects, but the first emperor <b>was</b> <b>anxious</b> to avoid the same trouble that Tibet had caused for the Tang dynasty. Instead of recognizing the Phagmodru ruler, the Hongwu Emperor sided with the Karmapa of the nearer Kham region and southeastern Tibet, sending envoys out in the winter of 1372–1373 to ask the Yuan officeholders to renew their titles for the new Ming court.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of the King or {{government}} in occupied Belgium, Mercier became the predominant figure in the country and a symbol of resilience. Because of his status, he could not be arrested without an outcry and, although lured back to the Vatican in 1915 to remove him from the country, he soon returned. His writings were banned, however, and copies of their work confiscated. In 1916, Mercier was officially prohibited from publishing pamphlets but continued to campaign against the deportation of workers and various other German policies. Initially opposed by Pope Benedict XV, who <b>was</b> <b>anxious</b> to remain neutral, the Pope was supportive of the Belgian church but encouraged it to moderate its stance to avoid confrontation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of sound cinema, among the various {{distinguished}} composers ready to try their hand at film music, Prokofiev was not an obvious choice for the commission. Based in Paris for almost a decade, he had a reputation for experimentation and dissonance, characteristics at odds with the cultural norms of the Soviet Union. By early 1933, however, Prokofiev <b>was</b> <b>anxious</b> to return to his homeland, and saw the film commission as an opportunity to write music in a more popular and accessible style.|$|E

5|$|Leopold Mozart {{had been}} {{employed}} since 1747 {{as a musician}} in the Archbishop of Salzburg's court, becoming deputy Kapellmeister in 1763, but he had also devoted much time to Wolfgang's and sister Nannerl's musical education. He took them on a European tour between 1764 and 1766, and spent some of 1767 and most of 1768 {{with them in the}} imperial capital, Vienna. The children's performances had captivated audiences, and the pair had made a considerable impression on European society. By 1769, Nannerl had reached adulthood, but Leopold <b>was</b> <b>anxious</b> to continue 13-year-old Wolfgang's education in Italy, a crucially important destination for any rising composer of the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} tend {{to reject}} the figures given by Herodotus and other ancient sources as unrealistic and as resultant from miscalculations or exaggerations {{on the part of}} the victors. Modern scholarly estimates are generally in the range 120,000–300,000. These estimates usually come from studying the logistical capabilities of the Persians in that era, the sustainability of their respective bases of operations, and the overall manpower constraints affecting them. Whatever the real numbers were, however, it is clear that Xerxes <b>was</b> <b>anxious</b> to ensure a successful expedition by mustering an overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} thus generally {{attribute the}} numbers {{given in the}} ancient sources to the result of miscalculations or exaggerations {{on the part of}} the victors, or disinformation by the Persians in the run up to the war. The topic has been hotly debated but the modern consensus revolves around the figure of 300,000500,000. Nevertheless, whatever the real numbers were, it is clear that Xerxes <b>was</b> <b>anxious</b> to ensure a successful expedition by mustering overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea, and also that much of the army died of starvation and disease, never returning to Asia.|$|E

Undoubtedly too he <b>was</b> <b>anxious</b> to remove relics from the guardianship of secular communities to a reformed monastic environment. But ultimately even more vital was the link between cult and territorial possession, focused on the saint's role as protector and spiritual lord of his community.|$|E
5|$|Now Vice President-elect, Johnson <b>was</b> <b>anxious</b> to {{complete}} the work of re-establishing civilian government in Tennessee, although the timetable for {{the election of a}} new governor did not allow it to take place until after Inauguration Day, March 4. He hoped to remain in Nashville {{to complete}} his task, but was told by Lincoln's advisers that he could not stay, but would be sworn in with Lincoln. In these months, Union troops finished the retaking of eastern Tennessee, including Greeneville. Just before his departure, the voters of Tennessee ratified a new constitution, abolishing slavery, on February 22, 1865. One of Johnson's final acts as military governor was to certify the results.|$|E

On 27 June, following further discussions in London, the brothers were arrested on a warrant issued under the Fugitive Offenders Act, and brought before the Georgetown magistrates, where they were charged with the theft of Girl Pat.|$|E
