5|$|Parabronchi {{in which}} the air flow is {{unidirectional}} are called paleopulmonic parabronchi and are found in all birds. Some birds, however, have, in addition, a lung structure <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> flow in the parabronchi is bidirectional. These are termed neopulmonic parabronchi.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{during her}} reign, Anne {{and her husband}} spent the winter at Kensington and St James's Palaces, and the summer at Windsor Castle or Hampton Court Palace, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> was fresher. George had {{recurrent}} asthma, and the cleaner air in the country was better for his breathing. They visited the spa town of Bath, Somerset, in mid-1702, {{on the advice of}} George's doctors, and again in mid-1703. They occasionally visited Newmarket, Suffolk, to view the horse racing. On one visit, Anne bought George a horse, Leeds, for the vast sum of a thousand guineas.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} and fourth days (September 1 and 2, 1983), work began with the Canadarm Remote Manipulator System and the payload test article, and {{communications}} testing through TDRS continued. The former was successful, but the latter lost contact on a number of occasions, due to problems at the White Sands ground station. As a result, the crew had to be awakened early on September 1 {{in order to deal with}} the problem. A minor cabin pressure leak on September 2 was traced to the waste management system, and quickly controlled. The orbiter performed an Orbital Maneuvering System firing on September 2 to place itself in a lower orbit, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> density was higher and the oxygen interaction experiments would work more effectively.|$|E

5|$|On the way back, {{they stayed}} again at Thebes from March to September, making many new drawing and {{paintings}} of the monuments there. Here, at the Valley of the Kings the expedition moved into the tomb of Ramesses IV (of the 20th dynasty), <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> was cooler. They also located the tomb of Ramesses the Great, but it was badly looted. It was here that Champollion first received news of Young's campaign to vindicate himself as the decipherer of the hieroglyphs and to discredit Champollion's decipherments. He received this news {{only a few days}} after Young's death in London.|$|E
5|$|Several {{historical}} events {{have taken place}} in and around the town, including attempted negotiations between King Charles I and the Parliamentary Army during the English Civil War. The public house at the centre of those events, since renamed the Crown & Treaty, still stands. Uxbridge also houses the Battle of Britain Bunker, from <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> defence of the south-east of England was coordinated during the Battle of Britain. Situated in RAF Uxbridge, the No. 11 Group Operations Room within the bunker played a crucial rule during the battle and was later used during the D-Day landings.|$|E
5|$|As {{they return}} to the city, Olivia and Charlie discuss plans with Astrid on how to capture Milo, but realize that since he can predict their every move, any plan would be futile, and {{approach}} the hotel directly. Milo leads Olivia on a chase through a construction area including a marked zone <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> is too thin, expecting to crush her under a load of cement bricks. Olivia, unaware of the warning signs for the zone, races through it instead of stopping {{to put on a}} respirator, nearly asphyxiating herself, and dodges the bricks in time to capture Milo. At the center, Dr. Levin notes that Milo's condition is too far advanced to reverse, and only a computer is able to keep up with his thoughts. Madeline sadly leaves the toy horse at Milo's side.|$|E

5|$|The Italian {{scientist}} Galileo Galilei {{knew that}} air had mass {{and so was}} subject to gravity. In 1640, he demonstrated that an established force resisted {{the formation of a}} vacuum. However, it would remain for his pupil Evangelista Torricelli to create an apparatus that would produce a partial vacuum in 1643. This experiment resulted in the first mercury barometer and created a scientific sensation in Europe. The French mathematician Blaise Pascal reasoned that if the column of mercury was supported by air then the column ought to be shorter at higher altitude <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> pressure is lower. In 1648, his brother-in-law, Florin Périer, repeated the experiment on the Puy de Dôme mountain in central France and found that the column was shorter by three inches. This decrease in pressure was further demonstrated by carrying a half-full balloon up a mountain and watching it gradually expand, then contract upon descent.|$|E
5|$|In {{these new}} towns, the {{aristocracy}} was allocated the higher areas, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> was cooler and fresher and the views finest. The church was allocated the town centre (Illustration 8), for convenience to all, and {{to reflect the}} church's global and central position; round the pairing of cathedral and episcopal Palazzo Vescovile were built the convents. The merchants and storekeepers chose their lots on the planned wider streets leading from the main piazzas. Finally, the poor were allowed to erect their simple brick huts and houses in the areas nobody else wanted. Lawyers, doctors, {{and members of the}} few professions including the more skilled artisans - those who fell between the strictly defined upper and lower class - and were able to afford building plots, often lived {{on the periphery of the}} commercial and upper class residential sectors, but equally often these people just lived in a larger or grander house than their neighbours in the poorer areas. However, many of the skilled artists working on the rebuilding lived as part of the extended households of their patrons. In this way Baroque town planning came to symbolize and reflect political authority, and later its style and philosophy spread as far as Annapolis and Savannah in English America, and most notably Haussmann's 19th century re-designing of Paris. The stage was now set for the explosion of Baroque architecture, which was to predominate in Sicily until the early 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Will and Cal {{attempt to}} rescue Chester {{before he is}} sent to the deeps on the 'Miner's Train', but the Styx arrive and they are forced to leave Chester behind. During the botched escape attempt, it is {{revealed}} that Rebecca, Will's adoptive sister, is actually a Styx implanted in his family to monitor him. The boys head through a series of tunnels to the Eternal City, and old stone city, estimated by Will to be from Roman times, <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> is filled with deadly bio-toxins. They avoid the Styx soldiers, who patrol the city with their vicious stalker attack dogs, and eventually emerge {{on the bank of the}} Thames. Will makes for his home in Highfield, but there Will's health deteriorates, so Cal helps him to his Auntie Jean's flat where he recovers. Soon they return underground to find Will's adoptive father, and attempt to rescue Chester once again. They encounter another Styx patrol, and Uncle Tam kills a member of the Styx, whom he calls Crawfly, but is mortally wounded in the fight, and the strong willed Uncle Tam chooses to stay behind to give the boys time to escape. With the help of Imago Freebone, a member of Uncle Tam's gang, Will and Cal escape to a small hiding place halfway between the Colony and the Eternal City. There, they rest and mourn for Uncle Tam; and are told by Imago that Chester's train to the deeps will pass directly under their hiding spot shortly. They jump down into the train through a hole in the floor of the hiding spot, and find Chester. Together they ride down to the Deeps. In the book's epilogue, Rebecca kills Imago, who was hiding on the surface, by poison.|$|E

25|$|These speeds {{cannot be}} {{confidently}} used to understand <b>where</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> {{is moving to}} in the long run, because the forcing naturally changes or the trajectories are skewed {{with respect to the}} pressure pattern.|$|E

25|$|Cirriform {{clouds are}} {{generally}} {{of the genus}} cirrus and have the appearance of detached or semi-merged filaments.

50|$|Warm fronts occur <b>where</b> <b>the</b> warm <b>air</b> pushes out a {{previously}} lodged cold <b>air</b> mass. <b>The</b> warm <b>air</b> overrides <b>the</b> cooler <b>air</b> and moves upward.

25|$|Incus is {{the most}} type-specific {{supplementary}} feature, seen only with cumulonimbus of the species capillatus.

25|$|Thermoclines, or sudden {{changes in}} {{temperature}}. <b>Where</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> temperature {{is higher than}} the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends.
