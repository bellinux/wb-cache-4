5|$|Sabo {{then began}} redistributing {{ammunition}} to {{other members of}} the platoon, including stripping ammunition from wounded and dead comrades.

Sabo again stepped out into the open and provided covering fire for the helicopter until his ammunition was exhausted. He received several serious wounds under heavy fire by the North Vietnamese while trying to reload. Although mortally wounded, Sabo crawled forward toward the enemy emplacement, pulled the pin of a grenade, and threw it at the last possible second toward an enemy bunker.

All these themes recur in his engravings, which echo Hogarth's attention to moral themes. For example, he shows <b>wounded</b> <b>soldiers</b> with wooden legs, back from the wars, and animals with a gallows in the background.|$|E
