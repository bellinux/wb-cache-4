25|$|Children who {{are blind}} not only have the {{education}} disadvantage {{of not being able}} to see — they also miss out on fundamental parts of early and advanced education if not provided with the necessary tools.

The children <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>blind</b> <b>or</b> had low vision also had weaker hip extensors, but after LBW correction, only the blind children's hip extensors were weaker than those of the children with normal vision. The findings indicate that congenitally <b>blind</b> children may <b>be</b> prone to develop weak leg extensors because of poor body build or the constraints of blindness and that they require extensive physical intervention during infancy.
