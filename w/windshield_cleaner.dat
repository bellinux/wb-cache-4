50|$|A control {{within the}} car can be {{operated}} to spray washer fluid onto the windshield, typically using an electrical pump via jets mounted either beneath the windshield or beneath the wiper blade(s). The windshield wipers are automatically turned on, cleaning dirt and debris off the windshield. Some vehicles {{use the same}} method to clean the rear window or the headlights. The first <b>windshield</b> <b>cleaner</b> unit offered for automobiles was in 1936, as an aftermarket option to be installed on cars after they were bought.|$|E

40|$|Adult begging in Italy {{has been}} decriminalized since a Constitutional Court {{decision}} in 1995 and an ensuing law, no. 205, in 1999. Nonetheless, beggars, particularly Roma ones, are still {{perceived by the}} public as a nuisance, like an issue that should be dealt with. Sensible to the pressure of its constituency, even Florence—a city with a tradition of openness and inclusion—has taken measures against begging and other similar street-level economic activities. Between 2007 and 2008, {{the first wave of}} city action in Florence was directed at <b>windshield</b> <b>cleaners</b> at traffic lights. Even though the policy was challenged, it produced the intended effect of removing such beggars from their posts. Today, a second wave of city action, visible since 2013 and based on a very loose municipal regulation, has taken the form of routine de facto pressure exerted by local police on beggars that aims to remove beggars from the touristic city center. In the following pages we will first present the historical background of the matter, from the nineteenth-century criminal approach to the decriminalization of adult begging under the pressure of the Italian Constitutional Court in the 1990 s. Second, we turn to the local municipalities’ reaction to this change and explain how they tried to fill the space with a number of administrative measures—whose legitimacy may often still be questioned. Third, we focus on the experience of Florence by describing the mayor’s failed ordinances and the Regulation on Urban Police adopted in 2008 and currently in force. Finally, we present our ongoing work: specifically, the pending action against the alleged “data-base of beggars” and the activity against the potentially discriminatory police practice of fining beggars. In both cases, we will highlight how the Italian procedural system and culture seems to not support this kind of experimental public interest litigation...|$|R
50|$|The {{price of}} a golf cart can range {{anywhere}} from under US$1,000 to well over US$20,000 per cart, depending on several factors. These factors may include {{whether or not a}} fleet of carts is being purchased for a golf course or a country club, for example, and whether the carts are new or used. Other factors may include options such as equipment requirements, and how many people the cart is meant to transport. With the rise in popularity of golf carts, many golf clubs or country clubs offer storage and energy options to golf cart owners. This has led to the modification of golf carts to suit use at the particular golf course. Typical modification includes <b>windshields,</b> ball <b>cleaners,</b> cooler trays, upgraded motor or speed controller (to increase speed and/or torque), and lift kits.|$|R

40|$|The Shuttle Ice Liberation Coating (SILC) {{has been}} {{developed}} to reduce the adhesion of ice to surfaces on the space shuttle. SILC, when coated on a surface (foam, metal, epoxy primer, polymer surfaces), will reduce the adhesion of ice {{by as much as}} 90 percent as compared to the corresponding uncoated surface. This innovation is a durable coating that can withstand several cycles of ice growth and removal without loss of anti-adhesion properties. SILC is made of a binder composed of varying weight percents of siloxane(s), ethyl alcohol, ethyl sulfate, isopropyl alcohol, and of fine-particle polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The combination of these components produces a coating with significantly improved weathering characteristics over the siloxane system alone. In some cases, the coating will delay ice formation and can reduce the amount of ice formed. SILC is not an ice prevention coating, but the very high water contact angle (greater than 140) causes water to readily run off the surface. This coating was designed for use at temperatures near - 170 F (- 112 C). Ice adhesion tests performed at temperatures from - 170 to 20 F (- 112 to - 7 C) show that SILC is a very effective ice release coating. SILC can be left as applied (opaque) or buffed off until the surface appears clear. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data show that the coating is still present after buffing to transparency. This means SILC can be used to prevent ice adhesion even when coating windows or other objects, or items that require transmission of optical light. Car <b>windshields</b> are kept <b>cleaner</b> and SILC effectively mitigates rain and snow under driving conditions...|$|R
