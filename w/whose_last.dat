5|$|Corvinus {{was unwilling}} to break his own truce with Bayezid, having tacit Ottoman backing for his own war in the west. However, he granted his vassal a {{territorial}} gift in Transylvania, comprising the domains of Ciceu and Cetatea de Baltă. According to various interpretations, this exchange occurred in or after 1484, and was meant to compensate Stephen {{for the loss of}} his ports. Medievalist Marius Diaconescu dates the lease of Cetatea to 1482, when Corvinus agreed to give Stephen a place of refuge, should Moldavia fall to the Ottomans, while Ciceu only became Stephen's castle in 1489. Both citadels were on land confiscated after conflicts between the Three Nations and Corvinus. Ciceu had been a fief of the Losonczi family, under litigation, while Cetatea had been a special domain of the Voivode of Transylvania, <b>whose</b> <b>last</b> titular owner before Stephen was John Pongrác of Dengeleg.|$|E

5|$|Given {{its subject}} matter, the episode {{features}} many references to witchcraft and occultism. The nurse from the episode, Rebecca Waite, was originally {{named after a}} friend of the writers called Rebecca White. However, this was changed because there was a real nurse from Chicago <b>whose</b> <b>last</b> name was White. Some viewers ended up believing that Waite's name as a reference to either Rebecca Nurse, an innocent woman prosecuted during the Salem witch trials, or the Rider-Waite tarot deck, the most popular tarot deck utilized in the world. The episode itself directly references Gerald Gardner, a wiccan known for publishing several books on witchcraft and founder of the Gardnerian Tradition. While the Mayhew sisters tried to depict occultism without offending anybody by not connecting Franklin or Waite to any known cult, many Wiccans sent angry letters and e-mails to Fox regarding the portrayal of their beliefs.|$|E
