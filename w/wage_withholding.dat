40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Sociology, Anthropology, and Social WorkLaszlo KulcsarNepali {{women are}} often barred from going abroad through discriminatory state policies, {{and the women}} {{engaging}} in foreign employment are generally perceived as "loose" women in Nepalese society. The female migrant workers are also represented as lacking "agency" and "victims" of sex trafficking in the Nepalese media. Despite the unfavorable socio-political contexts, {{a substantial number of}} Nepali women have engaged in transnational labor migration in the last two decades, often "illegally" by using the open Nepal-India border to reach the destination countries. The study investigates the impact of women's migration on the dominant discourse relating to female workers' sexuality and agency by analyzing the experiences of female workers from Chitwan, Nepal, who have returned after working as housemaids in the Persian Gulf. The study finds that the dominant discourse is both contested and reproduced during the emigration process and after the return of female workers. However, the dominant discourse is overall restructured in the emigrant communities due to women's participation in foreign employment and return with diverse experiences. As women's varied migration experiences are hardly reported in the national media, the discursive change in the local communities does not necessarily bring a (similar) change in the national discourse. While violence prevailed against female workers in the Gulf, most acts of violence were indirect and non-physical. The extreme forms of violence, such as physical and sexual abuses, which are usually reported in the media, were somewhat uncommon. The major complaints of the respondents were low <b>wages,</b> <b>withholding</b> and non-payment of <b>wages,</b> <b>withholding</b> of passport, extremely long hours of work, constant criticism, lack of adequate rest, and the feeling of confinement. The violence against the housemaids was largely facilitated by the sponsorship-based labor recruitment system in the Gulf that bound the migrant workers with their employers. At the micro level, the living arrangement (having to live with the employers) was also a contributing factor to violence against the female workers. The female workers who were employed in a household with multiple housemaids were less likely to experience violence than those who were the only maid in the employer's house...|$|R

50|$|Workers in Paterson {{hoped to}} achieve similar success {{to those in}} Philadelphia. Just before Independence Day, they began a strike {{demanding}} shorter hours.

In support of the strikers, an organization called the Paterson Association for the Protection of the Working Class was established. They also received monetary support from workers in Newark and New York City. The strikers were mainly children, mainly female, and many of them were of Irish descent. Due to this last fact, debate around the strike quickly became infused with nativist and anti-immigrant rhetoric, especially from the Lowell Intelligencer, a pro-management newspaper.|$|E
5000|$|In {{response}} to concerns about agricultural labor shortages {{and the difficulty}} of hiring legal foreign guest workers, Looper and Democratic Sen. Abel Tapia drafted legislation to create a state office to assist with the logistics of clearing guest workers for jobs in Colorado; under their proposal, the state of Colorado would seek a waiver from the federal government to process H-2A visas applications, including operating a guest-worker screening office in Mexico. [...] The bill, which also contained a provision requiring that guest workers have 20% of their wages withheld until they returned to their home countries, was criticized as a possible violation of federal law.

50|$|Syria is a {{destination}} and transit country {{for women and}} children trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor. A significant number {{of women and children}} in the large and expanding Iraqi refugee community in Syria are reportedly forced into commercial sexual exploitation by Iraqi gangs or, in some cases, their families. Similarly, women from Somalia and Eastern Europe are trafficked into commercial sexual exploitation. Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian women recruited for work in Syria as cabaret dancers are not permitted to leave their work premises without permission, and they have their passports withheld—indicators of involuntary servitude. Some of these women may also be forced into prostitution. Anecdotal evidence suggests that Syria may be {{a destination}} for sex tourism from other countries in the region. In addition, women from Indonesia, the Philippines, Ethiopia, and Sierra Leone are recruited for work in Syria as domestic servants, but some face conditions of involuntary servitude, including long hours, non-payment of <b>wages,</b> <b>withholding</b> of passports, restrictions on movement, threats, and physical or sexual abuse. Syria may also be a transit point for Iraqi women and girls trafficked to Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.), and Lebanon for forced prostitution. The Government of Syria does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so. Syria again failed to report any law enforcement efforts to punish trafficking offenses over the last year. In addition, the government did not offer protection services to victims of trafficking and may have arrested, prosecuted, or deported some victims for prostitution or immigration violations.|$|R
5000|$|A receipt is {{a written}} {{acknowledgment}} {{that a person}} has received money or property in payment following a sale or other transfer of goods or provision of a service. If {{the recipient of the}} payment is legally required to collect sales tax or VAT from the customer, the amount would be added to the receipt and the collection would be deemed to have been on behalf of the relevant tax authority. In many countries a retailer is required to include the sales tax or VAT in the displayed price of goods sold, from which the tax amount would be calculated at point of sale and remitted to the tax authorities in due course. Similarly, amounts may be deducted from amounts payable, {{as in the case of}} <b>wage</b> <b>withholding</b> taxes. On the other hand, tips or other gratuities given by a customer, for example in a restaurant, would not form part of the payment amount or appear on the receipt.|$|E
50|$|Child support {{programs}} work with district or state attorneys, {{law enforcement agencies}} and officials of family or domestic relations courts to deliver services at the local level. OCSE is the U.S. central authority for international child support and provides assistance to families, states, and countries seeking support when family members live in different countries. OCSE works with many public and private partners to increase child support collections and help parents meet the financial needs of their children. Employers are vital to the child support program. The majority of child support (70%) is collected through direct <b>wage</b> <b>withholding.</b> Employers are responsible to report newly hired and terminated employees, withhold child support payments as ordered, enroll children in health care coverage, and remit child support to the State Disbursement Units. A critical function of OCSE is authorized data matching. Employers are required to report newly hired employees to their designated state agency. OCSE gathers and maintains these records to match against state child support records to locate parents who owe child support, locate income sources and prevent erroneous payments and fraudulent access to government benefit programs. At the state level, ORS has contracts to receive local information from the Department of Workforce Services, Utah Criminal Justice Information Systems, and many other city, county, state, and federal resources. Although ORS is able to utilize the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act (UAPA) process to establish most paternity and child support orders administratively, they also work closely with staff assigned to them from the state Office of the Attorney General (AG). The Attorneys from the AG office represent ORS in court and whenever legal representation is required.|$|E
5000|$|OCSE {{has many}} {{enforcement}} tools to collect child support such as <b>wage</b> <b>withholding,</b> bank account seizures, and driver’s license and passport suspensions. The challenge that the OCSE faces is {{what to do}} when such tools do not work. Unemployment throws a wrench in these processes. As an example, whenever there is an economic downturn many single parents who are not well educated or well-trained are the first to lose their jobs and the last to be rehired. As a result, they lose income that then cannot be collected for child support. Other challenges that OCSE faces are balancing the rights and responsibilities of non-custodial parents with the needs of the custodial parent and child. Many non-custodial parents feel they are powerless in the child support establish and collection process. They will sometimes feel resentful and offended, which leads to a lack of cooperation in paying their child support. Another challenge is establishing paternity and support orders for children that are a product of same sex relationships. For example, determining the support and custody of a child can be complicated because the courts need to take into consideration the biological parenthood of the child, and the rights of surrogate parents who desire to raise the child. Some courts will determine that a person who agrees to start a family with a same-sex partner, with plans to raise children together, is a parent and, therefore, is responsible for child support. In conclusion, child support has evolved over time from serving families on welfare, or children who had lost parents to war and abandonment, to working through the complications of a modern society where parents with children are divorced, separated, or who were never married. Working with various public and private partners OCSE and their state affiliates collect billions of dollars in needed support for dependent children across the country.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the decisions of}} Russian managers in distributing wage nonpayment in Russia during the 1994 - 96 period. Using a longitudinal survey of households, we identify a pattern of wage arrears across regions and industries which suggests that managers allocated nonpayment among workers so as to minimize the real wage declines experienced by higher productivity workers. This finding suggests that post-Soviet managers were responding more strongly to market incentives than to equity considerations in their <b>wage</b> <b>withholding</b> allocation decisions...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop and}} {{estimate}} {{a model of}} the child support and labor supply decisions in the formal and underground sectors for low-income fathers who have never married the mother of their child, as well as the paternity establishment decisions of the mothers. Ethnographic studies have found that child support policies such as automatic <b>wage</b> <b>withholding,</b> relatively high child support award amounts, and low child support disregards for children on welfare may encourage low-income fathers to evade child support regulations by working ‘off the books’ and by making under-the-table child support payments. Similarly, these policies, particularly the low child support disregard for women on welfare, may encourage mothers of children born outside marriage to refuse to cooperate with the child support authorities in establishing paternity and obtaining a formal child support order. Our model assumes a Stackelberg structure in which the father can implicitly determine whether the mother cooperates with the child support authorities through an informal child support payment, which may be zero. If the father’s informal child support payment is not high enough to induce the mother to not cooperate with establishing paternity, then he is subject to automatic <b>wage</b> <b>withholding</b> of the ordered amount if he works in the formal sector.
