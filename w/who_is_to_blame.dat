His second work, also in Russian, was his Letters on the Study of Nature (1845–46). In 1847 appeared his novel <b>Who</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>blame?</b> This is a story about how the domestic happiness of a young tutor, who marries the unacknowledged daughter of a Russian sensualist of the old type, dull, ignorant and genial, is troubled by a Russian sensualist of the new school, intelligent, accomplished, and callous, with there being no possibility of saying who is most to blame for the tragic ending.|$|E

[...] <b>Who</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>blame?</b> [...] It is you! [...] The Bible says that if your hand, eye or mouth is at fault, it should be cut off." [...] While the {{government}} efforts were a failure, the LRA reaction caused many Acholi to finally turn against the insurgency. [...] However, this was tempered by the deep-seated antagonism towards the occupying government forces.|$|E
2500|$|His critics {{describe}} him as [...] "a political radical <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>blame,</b> in part, for the deterioration of race relations". Sociologist Orlando Patterson has referred {{to him as a}} racial arsonist, while liberal columnist Derrick Z. Jackson has called him the black equivalent of Richard Nixon and Pat Buchanan. Sharpton sees much of the criticism as a sign of his effectiveness. [...] "In many ways, what they consider criticism is complimenting my job," [...] he said. [...] "An activist's job is to make public civil rights issues until there can be a climate for change." ...|$|E

2500|$|Aleksandr Ivanovich Herzen ( [...] ; [...] ) was a Russian {{writer and}} thinker {{known as the}} [...] "father of Russian socialism" [...] {{and one of the}} main fathers of agrarian {{populism}} (being an ideological ancestor of the Narodniki, Socialist-Revolutionaries, Trudoviks and the agrarian American Populist Party). With his writings, many composed while exiled in London, he attempted to influence the situation in Russia, contributing to a political climate that lead to the emancipation of the serfs in 1861. He published the important social novel <b>Who</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>Blame?</b> (1845–46). His autobiography, My Past and Thoughts (written 1852–1870), is often considered the best specimen of that genre in Russian literature.|$|E

Besides, none of the natives have been near us to-day. That, of course, might be because {{they are afraid of}} these chaps; but from this shanty we can see the canoes, and not one has gone out to-day. <b>Who</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> them, when one of their chiefs was shot {{yesterday}} without a shadow of excuse? I don't say that I think so much of a nigger's life one way or another; and having been in some stiff fights together, as you know, I have always taken my share. But I am dead against shooting without some reason; it spoils trade, and makes it unsafe even to land for water. I have half a mind, Bill, to go on board and ask Atkins to take us away with him; we could mighty soon settle matters with the crew, and if there was a fight and we had to shoot them all, we could take the brig into port well enough." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Who</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>blame</b> {{for this}} and how they first got in I do not know. But I {{understand}} that they first of all built a private college of their own close to Oxford, and then edged themselves in foot by foot. If this is so they only followed up the precedent of the recognised method in use in America. When an American college is established, the women go and build a college of their own overlooking the grounds. Then they put on becoming caps and gowns and stand and look over the fence at the college athletics. The male undergraduates, who were originally and by nature a hardy lot, were not easily disturbed. But inevitably some of the senior trustees {{fell in love with}} the first year girls and became convinced that coeducation was a noble cause. American statistics show that between 1880 and 1900 the number of trustees and senior professors who married girl undergraduates or who wanted to do so reached a percentage of,--I forget the exact percentage; it was either a hundred or a little over.|$|E
60|$|Also {{to bring}} such matters within the {{cognizance}} {{of the criminal}} law would be a new and, indeed, a dangerous departure not altogether easy to justify, especially as old magistrates like myself, who have considerable experience of such cases must know, {{it is not always}} the man <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>blame.</b> Personally, I incline to the view that if the age of consent were raised, and the contribution exacted from the putative father of an illegitimate child made proportionate to his means, and not limited, as it is now, to a maximum of 5s. a week, the criminal law might well be left out of the question. It must be remembered further, as Mrs. Booth pointed out herself, that there is another remedy, namely, that of a better home-training of girls who should be prepared by their mothers or friends to face the dangers of the world, a duty which these too often neglect. The result is that many young women who feel lonely and desire to get married, overstep the limits of prudence on receipt of a promise that thus they may attain their end, with the result that generally they find themselves ruined and deserted.|$|E
