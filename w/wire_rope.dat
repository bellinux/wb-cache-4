5|$|On 31 January, {{an attempt}} was made to free Missouri with the {{assembled}} collection of tug boats and salvage ships. This attempt was ultimately unsuccessful, owing to an anchor from a previous wreck that had become embedded in Missouris hull. The extreme force generated by the tugs caused several two-inch cables made from <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> to break, and the failed attempt also revealed that Missouri needed to lose more weight if the next attempt was to be successful. In light of this, some additional changes were made for the next attempt, which included cutting the anchors and chains off the battleship—after they had been re-added at Wallin's request—and the inclusion of additional pontoons to help lighten Missouri even more. A second attempt was tentatively scheduled for 1 February.|$|E
25|$|Some ships use <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> {{for one or}} more {{of their}} mooring lines. <b>Wire</b> <b>rope</b> is hard to handle and maintain. There is also risk {{associated}} with using <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> on a ship's stern in the vicinity of its propeller.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{modeling}} method and dynamical characteristics of steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> {{has been researched}} for several decades. In the past, steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> were usually modeled as a two dimensional system, which was only suitable for the planar motion. Also, no kink-wave propagation was considered when steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> were used in relatively low speed engineering application areas. By contrast, a three dimensional approach to model steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> used in high energy absorber apparatus is presented in this paper. Three dimensional contacts between steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> and other objects and kink-wave propagation in steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> are taken into consideration when applying the new approach to model steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes.</b> Compared to the two dimensional model of steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes,</b> the proposed model regards steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> as a multi-body system consisting of identical cylindrical elements with {{6 degrees of freedom}} connected by space constraints. Impact forces generated by three dimensional contacts between steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> and other objects are calculated and theories of elastic wave propagation are applied to analyze the kink-wave propagation when steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> are loaded with a sudden perpendicular impact by a high speed moving object. In addition, mathematical model of steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> is established and numerical simulation of the three dimensional model of steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> is implemented. By comparing the simulation results with the experimental data available, the model of steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> proposed in this paper is demonstrated to be valid and correct. Therefore, the proposed {{modeling method}} can be treated as a new approach in the research field of modeling steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes.</b> The dynamical characteristics of the steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> based on this new modeling approach are addressed simultaneously and plots of the dynamics of steel <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> cannot only be regarded as a basis for the further comparative studies, but also can provide some significant and interesting results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{the fire}} {{resistance}} performance of high-strength concrete columns was evaluated {{to see the}} influence of lateral confinement reinforcement with <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> for improving ductility, fire resistance reinforcement with fiber cocktail and load ratio. For this, loaded fire test was conducted under ISO 834 standard fire condition. The axial ductility of the 60 MPa high-strength concrete column reinforced with pre-stressed <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> was improved and its fire resistance performance was also improved by 23 % compared with its counterpart without <b>wire</b> <b>ropes.</b> The appropriate load for the 60 MPa concrete column reinforced with <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> {{was found to be}} 70 % of design load. The fire resistance performance of the 100 MPa high-strength concrete column reinforced with pre-stressed <b>wire</b> <b>ropes</b> and fiber-cocktail was improved as much as 4 times compared with that reinforced with tie bars only. The appropriate load for the 100 MPa columns was found to be less than 70 % of design load in order for the columns to secure required fire resistance performance...|$|R

25|$|A cable barrier, {{sometimes}} referred to as guard cable or <b>wire</b> <b>rope</b> safety barrier (WRSB), is a type of roadside or median safety traffic barrier/guard rail. It consists of steel wire ropes mounted on weak posts.

Also similar to most roadside barriers, cable barriers function by capturing and/or redirecting the errant vehicle.|$|E
