6000|$|... "There are two {{theoretical}} methods whereby man {{may become}} the master [...] of society, and make of society an intelligent and efficacious device [...] for the pursuit and capture of happiness and laughter. The first [...] theory advances the proposition that no government can be wiser or [...] better than the people that compose that government; that reform and [...] development must spring from the individual; that {{in so far as}} the [...] individuals become <b>wiser</b> <b>and</b> better, by that much will their [...] government become <b>wiser</b> <b>and</b> better; in short, that the majority of [...] individuals must become <b>wiser</b> <b>and</b> better, before their government [...] becomes <b>wiser</b> <b>and</b> better. The mob, the political convention, the [...] abysmal brutality and stupid ignorance of all concourses of people, [...] give the lie to this theory. In a mob the collective intelligence [...] and mercy is that of the least intelligent and most brutal members [...] that compose the mob. On the other hand, a thousand passengers will [...] surrender themselves to the wisdom and discretion of the captain, [...] when their ship is in a storm on the sea. In such matter, he is the [...] <b>wisest</b> <b>and</b> most experienced among them.|$|R

5|$|Robert Wise was in {{post-production}} on West Side Story {{when he read}} {{a review}} in Time magazine of author Shirley Jackson's novel, The Haunting of Hill House. Wise read the book and found it frightening; he passed it to screenwriter friend Nelson Gidding, whom he had worked with on the 1958 film I Want to Live!. Gidding did a full story treatment for Wise before proceeding {{to work on the}} adaptation. As Gidding crafted the screenplay, he came to believe that the novel was not a ghost story at all, but rather a compilation of the insane thoughts of the lead character, Eleanor Vance. He theorised that Vance was having a nervous breakdown, envisaging a scenario in which Hill House is the hospital where she is held, Markway is her psychiatrist, the cold, banging, and violence are the results of shock treatment, and the opening and closing of doors reflected the opening and closing of hospital doors. <b>Wise</b> <b>and</b> Gidding traveled to Bennington, Vermont to meet Shirley Jackson who told them {{that it was a good}} idea, but the novel was definitely about the supernatural. Nonetheless, elements of the insanity concept remained in the script, so that the audience was left wondering whether the supernatural events in the film were in Eleanor's mind or whether they were real. It was also during their visit with Jackson that <b>Wise</b> <b>and</b> Gidding chose the title for the film. As they did not want to keep the book title, they asked Jackson if she had considered an alternative title. She suggested The Haunting, which <b>Wise</b> <b>and</b> Gidding immediately adopted.|$|E
