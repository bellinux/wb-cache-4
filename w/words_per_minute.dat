5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication is typically much slower than speech, with users generally producing 8–10 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> Rate enhancement strategies {{can increase the}} user's rate of output to around 12–15 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute,</b> {{and as a result}} enhance the efficiency of communication.|$|E
5|$|The Amateur Station Operator's Licence, General Grade, {{requires}} {{a minimum of}} 50% in each section of the written examination, and 60% overall, and a demonstration of proficiency in sending and receiving Morse code at 8 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (without errors for each). The minimum age is 14 years. The licence allows a user to make radiotelegraphy and radiotelephony transmission in 13 frequency bands. The maximum power allowed is 400W. In addition, satellite communication, facsimile, and television modes are permitted.|$|E
5|$|Balzac's {{work habits}} are legendary, he wrote from 1 am to 8 am {{every night and}} {{sometimes}} even longer. Balzac could write very rapidly; some of his novels, written with a quill, were composed at a pace equal to thirty <b>words</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> on a modern typewriter. His preferred method was to eat a light meal at five or six in the afternoon, then sleep until midnight. He then rose and wrote for many hours, fueled by innumerable cups of black coffee. He would often work for fifteen hours or more at a stretch; {{he claimed to have}} once worked for 48 hours with only three hours of rest in the middle.|$|E
50|$|A {{difference}} between amateur radio licenses and commercial radiotelegraph licenses is that commercial operators {{must be able}} to receive code groups of random characters along with plain language text. For each class of license, the code group speed requirement is slower than the plain language text requirement. For example, for the Radiotelegraph Operator License, the examinee must pass a 20 <b>word</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> plain text test and a 16 <b>word</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> code group test.|$|R
50|$|As {{an example}} {{illustrating}} switching speeds or timing requirements consider that when sending Morse code at a 20 <b>word</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> rate the typical dot signal duration {{is a mere}} 50 milliseconds. To enable good quality QSK operation the switching hardware must switch the radio antenna from receiver to transmitter in much less than one tenth of the dot duration. At 20 <b>word</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> code speed this means that QSK T/R switching times {{must be in the}} range of 1 to 1/2 millisecond or below. Even smaller sub-millisecond times are required with higher speed Morse code transmissions.|$|R

25|$|On January 7, 1972, the FCC amended Part 97 {{to allow}} faster RTTY speeds. Four {{standard}} RTTY speeds were authorized, namely, 60 (45 baud), 67 (50 baud), 75 (56.25 baud) and 100 (75 baud) <b>words</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> Many Amateur Radio operators had equipment that {{was capable of}} being upgraded to 75 and 100 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> by changing teleprinter gears. While there was an initial interest in 100 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> operation, many Amateur Radio operators moved back to 60 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> Some {{of the reasons for}} the failure of 100 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> HF RTTY included poor operation of improperly maintained mechanical teleprinters, narrow bandwidth terminal units, continued use of 170Hz shift at 100 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> and excessive error rates due to multipath distortion and the nature of ionospheric propagation.|$|E
25|$|By {{the mid-19th}} century, the {{increasing}} pace of business communication {{had created a}} need for mechanization of the writing process. Stenographers and telegraphers could take down information at rates up to 130 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute,</b> whereas a writer with a pen was limited {{to a maximum of}} 30 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (the 1853 speed record).|$|E
50|$|In {{the absence}} of {{reliable}} evidence to support it, {{it seems that the}} widespread view that some languages are spoken more rapidly than others is an illusion. This illusion may well be related to other factors such as differences of rhythm and pausing.

Naïve listeners appeared to perceive struggle behaviors as negative, increased speech output (including repetitions and empty speech) as positive, faster speech (closer to a normal speaker’s average <b>word</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute)</b> preferable to slow speech, and more understandable speech as better quality speech...|$|R
40|$|Given {{the recent}} trends in {{education}} focusing on oral reading fluency, this action research {{is an attempt}} to determine strategies teachers can use with struggling intermediate readers. The research focused on a single participant in sixth grade, with identified special needs, in an urban elementary school.

Data analysis indicates that repeated reading was an effective strategy at increasing <b>words</b> correct <b>per</b> <b>minute,</b> <b>words</b> read <b>per</b> <b>minute,</b> accuracy rates, and oral reading scores while decreasing the amount and type of miscues. This implies that this is an effective strategy teachers can implement {{within the context of a}} classroom setting with ease...|$|R
25|$|For Grade II, {{the test}} piece {{consists}} of 125 letters, with five letters forming one word.

25|$|Some {{shorthand}} systems {{attempted to}} ease {{learning by using}} characters from the Latin alphabet. Such non-stenographic systems have often been described as alphabetic, and purists might claim that such systems are not 'true' shorthand. However, these alphabetic systems do have value for students who cannot dedicate the years necessary to master a stenographic shorthand. Alphabetic shorthands cannot be written at the speeds theoretically possible with symbol systems—200 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> or more—but require {{only a fraction of}} the time to acquire a useful speed of between 60 and 100 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In Morse code {{the basic}} signals are dots and dashes often verbalized as [...] "dits" [...] and [...] "dahs". According {{to the rules}} of Morse code. The dot {{duration}} is the basic unit of time measurement. The dash duration is equal to three dot durations.

The reciprocal of the dot duration is known as the dotting rate. The length of the dash signal is three dot durations. The Morse code dot and dash signals are always separated from each other by a silent period of at least one dot duration.|$|R

25|$|The next {{improvement}} was the Baudot code of 1874. French engineer Émile Baudot patented a printing telegraph {{in which the}} signals were translated automatically into typographic characters.

30|$|For this study, {{it is more}} {{appropriate}} to consider test takers’ writing fluency {{in relation to the}} total number of words they produced, as compared to writing fluency in producing individual words. The total number of words Ben produced was 487 and Mary 349. The final product of Ben contained 421 words and Mary 330 words. Ben had a noticeably higher text producing rate than Mary with respect to both number of words produced and number of words submitted. On average, Ben produced 15.50 words (process) and 13.41 <b>words</b> (final product) <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> Mary produced 6.01 words (process) and 5.68 <b>words</b> (final product) <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{straight}} key {{is simple and}} reliable, but the rapid pumping action needed to send a string of dots (or dits as most operators call them) poses some significant drawbacks.

25|$|PSK31's {{symbol rate}} of 31.25Hz {{was chosen because}} a normal typing speed of about 50 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> {{requires}} a bit rate of about 32 bits per second, and specifically because 31.25Hz could easily be derived from the 8kHz sample rate used in many DSP systems, including those used in the computer sound cards commonly used for PSK31 operation (31.25Hz is 8kHz divided by 256, and so {{can be derived from}} 8kHz by halving the frequency eight times in succession).|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} {{study was to examine}} the effects of Interactive Metronome (IM), a non-academic treatment, when integrated with reading intervention.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of repeated reading of decodable and less decodable text on oral reading fluency, specifically accuracy and correct <b>words</b> read <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> In addition the study sought {{to determine if a}} particular text type facilitated oral reading fluency for good, average, or poor readers. Participants read either decodable or less decodable texts or received regular classroom instruction. The two treatment groups reread two narrative and one informational text using four different techniques, (e. g. echo, choral and two variations of partner reading). The comparison group read a different leveled text each week as part of their regular classroom instruction. The leveled text was not reread. Treatment and comparison groups did not differ on post measures on nonsense word fluency or passage reading. Both treatment groups regardless of ability level increased significantly in words read correctly for each story. Thus, the repeated reading of text did have an effect on correct <b>words</b> read <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> There {{was no significant difference between}} the groups reading decodable and less decodable text for two of the three stories read, regardless of reading ability. There was a significant difference between the two groups of low ability readers on one story, with the students reading decodable text making a significant gain in oral reading fluency...|$|R
50|$|A {{transcription}} {{service is}} a business which converts speech (either live or recorded) into a written or electronic text document. Transcription services are often provided for business, legal, or medical purposes. The {{most common type of}} transcription is from a spoken-language source into text such as a computer file suitable for printing as a document such as a report. Common examples are the proceedings of a court hearing such as a criminal trial (by a court reporter) or a physician's recorded voice notes (medical transcription). Some transcription businesses can send staff to events, speeches, or seminars, who then convert the spoken content into text. Some companies also accept recorded speech, either on cassette, CD, VHS, or as sound files. For a transcription service, various individuals and organisations have different rates and methods of pricing. That can be <b>per</b> line, <b>per</b> <b>word,</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute,</b> or <b>per</b> hour, which differs from individual to individual and industry to industry. Transcription companies primarily serve private law firms, local, state and federal government agencies and courts, trade associations, meeting planners and nonprofits.|$|R
25|$|By this point, {{reception}} {{had been}} automated, but {{the speed and}} accuracy of the transmission were still limited to the skill of the human operator. The first practical automated system was patented by Charles Wheatstone, the original inventor of the telegraph. The message (in Morse code) was typed onto a piece of perforated tape using a keyboard-like device called the 'Stick Punch'. The transmitter automatically ran the tape through and transmitted the message at the then exceptionally high speed of 70 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Beardslee was {{considered}} to be capable of only a slow rate of transmission. The dial consisted of thirty positions around the circumference. In the worst case of a double letter, all thirty positions must be traversed to send the second iteration. The advancing mechanism is an escapement very similar as would be found in a pendulum driven clock. Each advance would require two movements of the escapement. Each movement would advance the dial six degrees with twelve degrees per step being 360/30. Therefore 60 movements would be required. Because of these factors, nothing over 5 <b>words</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> would have been achieved.|$|E
25|$|Until 1991, a {{demonstration}} of the ability to send and receive Morse code at a minimum of five <b>words</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> (wpm) was required to receive an amateur radio license for use in the United States from the Federal Communications Commission. Demonstration of this ability was still required for the privilege to use the HF bands. Until 2000, proficiency at the 20 wpm level was required to receive the highest level of amateur license (Amateur Extra Class); effective April 15, 2000, the FCC reduced the Extra Class requirement to five wpm. Finally, effective on February 23, 2007, the FCC eliminated the Morse code proficiency requirements from all amateur radio licenses.|$|E
40|$|On-line {{classification}} of slow cortical potentials (SCP) of the EEG allows {{the characterization of}} two to four different brain states {{which can be used}} for computer based selection of letters or words. 7 completely paralyzed, artificially respirated and fed lockedin patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis were trained to produce negative and positive SCP at the Vertex-electrode. After successful training selection of letters or words was possible with a maximum speed of one letter or <b>word</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> Patients whose training was initiated late at a completely locked-in-state were only able to answer yes-no questions with their SCP. New classification algorithms, in particular support vector machines, allow better classifications. First attempts to build a 150 channel MEG/EEG brain-computer-interface (BCI) for the locked-in and otherwise paralyzed patients are reported. Critical for successful application, however, is the selection of simple behavioral paradigms allowing patients with cognitive disorders and higher animals to produce classifiable brain states.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to observe how the {{amplitude}} of the myoelectric signal (MES) and the number of “EMG gaps ” recorded from the trapezius and levator scapulae muscles would change when computer work was performed with and without the induction of external stressors.

Ten volunteers with no history of shoulder, upper back or neck disorders performed data entry during three test conditions (N = no stress; IS = stress induced by work pace reward; ISI = stress induced by work pace reward plus irritation). Each condition was 30 -minutes in length. %RVE (percentage of amplitude of the MES based on a reference contraction) and number of “EMG gaps ” were the independent variables in a repeated-measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) (p< 0. 05) model that tested for differences between the test conditions. %RVE and EMG gaps were capable of detecting different types of stressors.

40|$|Background: Lack of {{evidence}} in literature to show low vision care enhances the reading performance in children with Multiple Disabilities and Visual Impairment (MDVI). Aim: To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} Low Vision Care intervention on the reading performance of children with MDVI. Materials and Methods: Three subjects who were diagnosed to have cerebral palsy and visual impairment, studying in a special school were recruited for the study. All of them underwent detailed eye examination and low vision care evaluation at a tertiary eye care hospital. A single subject multiple baseline (study) design was adopted and the study period was 16 weeks. The reading performance (reading speed, reading accuracy, reading fluency) was evaluated during the baseline phase and the intervention phase. The median of all the reading parameters for each week was noted. The trend of the reading performance was graphically represented in both the phases. Results: Reading speed increased by 37 <b>Word</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute,</b> 37 Letters <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> and 5 letters <b>per</b> <b>minute</b> for the subject 1, 2 and 3 respectively after the intervention. Reading accuracy was 84 %, 91 % and 86. 4 % {{at the end of the}} baseline period and 98. 7 %, 98. 4 % and 99 % at the end of 16 weeks for subject 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Average reading fluency score was 8. 3, 7. 1 and 5. 5 in the baseline period and 10. 2, 10. 2 and 8. 7 in the intervention period.
