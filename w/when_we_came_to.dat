5|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> {{record it}} in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

Monteux was the conductor {{for the two}} outstanding works of the season, Vaslav Nijinsky's ballet version of Debussy's Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune, made with the composer's approval, and Fokine's Daphnis et Chloé to a score commissioned from Ravel. Monteux later recalled [...] "Debussy was behind me when we played L'après midi d'un faune {{because he did not}} want anything in his score to be changed on account of the dancing. And <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> a forte, he said 'Monteux, that is a forte, play forte'. He did not want anything shimmering. And he wanted everything exactly in time".|$|E

Newspapers heralded Tubman's [...] "patriotism, sagacity, energy, [...] ability", {{and she was}} praised for her {{recruiting}} efforts – most of the newly liberated men went on to join the Union army. Tubman later worked with Colonel Robert Gould Shaw at the assault on Fort Wagner, reportedly serving him his last meal. She described the battle by saying: [...] "And then we saw the lightning, {{and that was the}} guns; and then we heard the thunder, and that was the big guns; and then we heard the rain falling, and that was the drops of blood falling; and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> get the crops, it was dead men that we reaped." ...|$|E

2500|$|Luke's {{presence}} in Rome with the Apostle Paul {{near the end}} of Paul's life was attested by 2 Timothy 4:11: [...] "Only Luke is with me".

[...] According to some accounts, Luke also contributed to the authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews.|$|E
2500|$|Stanley Donen, {{brought to}} Hollywood by Kelly {{to be his}} {{assistant}} choreographer, received co-director credit for On the Town. According to Kelly: [...] "...when you are involved in doing choreography for film you must have expert assistants. I needed one to watch my performance, and one {{to work with the}} cameraman on the timing..without such people as Stanley, Carol Haney and Jeanne Coyne I could never have done these things. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> do On the Town, I knew it was time for Stanley to get screen credit because we weren't boss-assistant anymore but co-creators." [...] Together, they opened up the musical form, taking the film musical out of the studio and into real locations, with Donen taking responsibility for the staging and Kelly handling the choreography. Kelly went much further than before in introducing modern ballet into his dance sequences, going so far in the [...] "Day in New York" [...] routine as to substitute four leading ballet specialists for Sinatra, Munshin, Garrett and Miller.|$|E

2500|$|Deploying {{with the}} army on 11 May 1745, {{the day of the}} battle' he {{unexpectedly}} found himself, on reaching the crest of a low hill, {{face to face with the}} Gardes Françaises, who, though anticipating an engagement as little as Hay, showed no sign of disorder. According to the French accounts, of which Voltaire's is the best known, Lord Charles stepped from the ranks and, in response to a similar movement promptly made by the French commander, politely called to him to order his people to fire, but in reply was assured, with equal politeness, that the French guards never fired first. According to the story which he himself sent in a letter to his brother three weeks later, his men came within twenty or thirty paces of the enemy, whereupon he advanced in front of the regiment, drank to the health of the French, bantered them with more spirit than pungency on their defeat at Dettingen, and then turned and called on his own men to huzzah, which they did. Hay recalled that [...] "it was our regiment that attacked the French Guards: and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> within twenty or thirty paces of them, I advanced before our regiment; drank to them and told them that we were the English Guards, and hoped they would stand till we came quite up to them, and not swim the Scheldt as they did the Main at Dettingen." ...|$|E
2500|$|George Martin {{claimed he}} first heard {{it at the}} [...] "Love Me Do" [...] re-make session on 11 September. Ringo Starr in Anthology stated: [...] "On my first visit in September we just ran through some tracks for George Martin. We even did 'Please Please Me'. I {{remember}} that, because while we were recording it I was playing the bass drum with a maraca {{in one hand and}} a tambourine in the other." [...] John Lennon in Anthology stated: [...] "We'd had a top 30 entry with 'Love Me Do' and we really thought we were on top of the world. Then came 'Please Please Me'—and wham! We tried to make it as simple as possible. Some of the stuff we've written in the past has been a bit way-out, but we aimed this one straight at the hit parade. … We almost abandoned it as the b-side of 'Love Me Do'. We changed our minds only because we were so tired the night we did Love Me Do. We'd been going over it a few times and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> the question of the flipside, we intended using 'Please Please Me'. Our recording manager, George Martin, thought our arrangement was fussy, so we tried to make it simpler. We were getting very tired, though, and we just couldn't seem to get it right. We are conscientious about our work and we don't like to rush things." ...|$|E
