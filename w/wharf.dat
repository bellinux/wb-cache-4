5|$|Late in its duration, Gert passed just {{southeast}} of Newfoundland before becoming extratropical, producing wave heights of 77.4ft (23.6m) offshore and 30ft (9m) onshore. In St. Bride's along the Avalon Peninsula, a large wave severely damaged a <b>wharf,</b> destroying five boats and damaging 45 others. Along the <b>wharf,</b> a wave swept three {{people into the}} ocean, hospitalizing one of them. The <b>wharf</b> required $2million (1999CAD, $1.9million 1999USD) in repairs, forcing its closure. Further west, high waves damaged a fish plant in Lord's Cove. Gale-force winds extended across southeastern Newfoundland, and in the Grand Banks a station reported winds of 74mph (120km/h). Onshore, the winds downed trees and caused power outages, primarily in the St. John's area. In addition, the adverse conditions from Gert prompted the cancellation of flights to and from St. John's International Airport.|$|E

50|$|The {{site had}} an even earlier {{connection}} with Howard Smith, as the Brisbane Central <b>Wharves</b> replaced smaller <b>wharves</b> {{constructed in the}} early years of the 20th century by Brisbane <b>Wharves</b> Ltd, for lease by William Howard Smith & Sons Ltd Howard Smith Co. Ltd.|$|R
50|$|The Howard Smith <b>Wharves</b> were {{constructed}} 1934-early 1940s by the Queensland Government to provide relief {{work during the}} depression years of the 1930s. Initially known as the Brisbane Central <b>Wharves,</b> the project was undertaken {{in conjunction with the}} construction of the Story Bridge, one of the Forgan-Smith government's principal employment-generating projects. Like other such schemes, the Brisbane Central <b>Wharves</b> not only provided employment, but established important infrastructure for Queensland's future development. Brisbane Central <b>Wharves</b> were leased by the Australian coastal shipping company Howard Smith Co. Ltd from the mid-1930s until the early 1960s, and are more usually referred to as the Howard Smith <b>Wharves.</b>|$|R

5|$|The hurricane's {{effects were}} severe {{in the city}} of Charleston, where the storm {{produced}} northeasterly winds and heavy rainfall. The bulwark of the fort at nearby James Island was destroyed, and the palisades of the fort at Castle Pinckney were wrecked at the mouth of Charleston's harbor. The hurricane also swept vessels aground into marshes and wharves between Gadsden's <b>Wharf</b> and South Bay along the Cooper River. Several wharves—Pritchard's, Cochran's, Beale's, Craft's, and William's—were struck by vessels and consequently severely damaged. The Montserrat, Mary, Birmingham Packet, Amazon, and Orange all endured some degree of damage. Three vessels and the Mary collided with Governor's Bridge, which was impaired as a result; two vessels and the Favorite slammed into Faber's <b>Wharf,</b> while the Concord filled with water at Prioleau's <b>Wharf,</b> resulting in the loss of 50tierces of rice. A counting and scale house was separated from its foundation after being struck by the Lydia within the vicinity of Blake's <b>Wharf,</b> while the African slave boat Christopher capsized at Geyer's <b>Wharf,</b> with all aboard escaping safely. Four slaves drowned after a boat overturned in the Ashley River.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} head of {{the canal}} was at Blackbridge <b>Wharf,</b> Winchester, just {{to the south of}} <b>Wharf</b> Mill, a grade II listed water mill dating from 1885, and College Walk, which spans the river at Blackbridge, an eighteenth-century stone bridge which is also grade II listed. Below the bridge, the channel splits, with the river flowing to the west and the navigation to the east. Blackbridge <b>Wharf</b> was accessed by <b>Wharf</b> Bridge, the oldest surviving bridge over the navigation, dating from the 1760s. Close by, the manager's house, a warehouse and some stables have also survived. The navigation flows past the grounds of Winchester College, which uses the waterway for rowing practice. The rowing eights use a winding basin just above the remains of St Catherine's Hill Lock, which now contains a modern sluice mechanism, and was the location of a water-powered sawmill, located {{to the west of the}} lock.|$|E

5000|$|Both <b>wharves</b> at Barangaroo are {{measured}} at 48 meters long and 23 meters wide, with both <b>wharves</b> {{being able to}} accommodate a maximum of eight ferries at any given time, with two on each of its four berths. Designed by Aurecon and Cox Architecture, whom had previously helped design the <b>wharves</b> of Brisbane's ferry network, the complex {{is similar to the}} design of <b>wharves</b> on Sydney Harbour redeveloped in the 2010s, with large, [...] "curved silver roofs" [...] as the artistic centerpiece of the structure. The complex also features [...] "fully accessible pontoons, seated waiting areas, weather protection, and real-time service information", with open, ungated access accompanied by opal card reader nodes at the entrance to both <b>wharves.</b> Lead architect David Holm stated that the <b>wharf's</b> design was crafted with the [...] "language that is consistent with the suite of Sydney harbour ferry wharves" [...] in mind, describing the [...] "twofold" [...] process of resolving function and identity. He further commented that the <b>wharf's</b> function, the [...] "delivery of streamlined passenger flows and a simplicity of functional layout" [...] was contrasted with its identity, an [...] "expression of Sydney harbour’s iconic maritime history and architectural form.|$|R

5|$|An {{important}} development {{during this}} period was {{the establishment of the}} Narrow Gauge Railway Museum at Tywyn <b>Wharf</b> station. The first exhibit for what was to become the museum was a locomotive donated in 1952 by Guinness from their recently closed St. James's Gate Brewery railway. In 1954 the Preservation Society agreed to start work on a formal museum and exhibits from around the United Kingdom were acquired to form the nucleus of the collection. In 1955 work started on converting the old gunpowder store at <b>Wharf</b> station into a temporary museum building, and in 1956 the first exhibit arrived at Tywyn.|$|E
5|$|At {{the north}} of the island are the remains of a 19th-century <b>wharf</b> {{including}} concrete tracks, rock cutting and iron fixings (several brackets and stumps). A concrete helipad west of the lighthouse was constructed in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s Tywyn <b>Wharf</b> station was {{in need of}} major improvements. Before preservation, the station had {{contained}} only a fan of sidings, which meant {{that there was no way}} for the locomotive of an arriving train to run round the carriages. As a result, trains were pushed from behind as far as Pendre, where the locomotive could be moved past the carriages to the front of the train. A loop was installed at <b>Wharf</b> for the first time in August 1952, to avoid having to propel trains to Pendre, but in the winter of 1964/65 a major upgrade of the station was carried out. This improved the track layout and extended the original office building to provide covered accommodation for passengers and a shop.|$|E

5|$|Combwich Pill, a small creek {{near the}} mouth of the river, had been used for {{shipping}} since the 14th century. From the 1830s, with the development of the brick and tile industry in the Combwich area, the <b>wharf</b> was used by two local brickyards to import coal and export tiles to Wales and parts of Gloucestershire. This traffic ceased in the 1930s; in the late 1950s the <b>wharf</b> was taken over and upgraded by the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) to bring in heavy materials for the Hinkley Point nuclear power stations. Construction of Hinkley Point A nuclear power station was ordered in 1957, with a scheduled completion date of 1960, but was not completed until 1965. This was followed by Hinkley Point B nuclear power station, which began operation in 1976. It is proposed to use the <b>wharf</b> again for the construction of Hinkley Point C.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-16th to {{the late}} 19th century, Deptford was home to Deptford Dockyard, the first Royal Navy Dockyard. The area {{declined}} as the Royal Navy moved out and commercial docks shut; the last dock, Convoys <b>Wharf,</b> closed in 2000.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, the Cooperative Wholesale Society (CWS), bought land at Trafford <b>Wharf</b> {{and set up}} a large food-packing {{factory and}} a flour mill.
