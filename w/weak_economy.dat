5|$|Unfortunately, {{there is}} also a cost in {{structurally}} keeping inflation lower than in the United States, UK, and China. The result is that seen from those countries, the euro has become expensive, making European products increasingly expensive for its largest importers. Hence export from the euro zone becomes more difficult. This {{is one of the main}} reasons why economic growth inside the euro zone now lags behind growth in other large economies. This effect is strongest in European countries with a <b>weak</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sweden's <b>weak</b> <b>economy</b> had {{suffered}} {{during the war}} and was now in a deep crisis. Charles assembled the Riksdag of the Estates in October 1680. The assembly has been described {{as one of the most}} important held by the Riksdag of the Estates. Here, the king finally pushed through the reduction ordeal, something that had been discussed in the Riksdag since 1650. It meant that any land or object previously owned by the crown and lent or given away— including counties, baronies and lordships— could be recovered. It affected many prominent members of the nobility, some of whom were ruined by it. One of them was the former guardian and Lord Chief Justice Magnus De La Gardie, who, among many other Estates, had to return the extravagant 248-room Läckö Castle. The reduction process involved the examination of every title deed in the kingdom, including the dominions, and it resulted in a complete readjustment of the nation's finances.|$|E
5|$|The bunkerisation {{programme}} was {{a massive}} drain on Albania's <b>weak</b> <b>economy.</b> The construction of prefabricated bunkers alone cost an estimated two percent of net material product, and in total the bunkers cost {{more than twice as}} much as the Maginot Line in France, consuming three times as much concrete. The programme diverted resources away from other forms of development, such as roads and residential buildings. On average, they are said to have each cost the equivalent of a two-room apartment and the resources used to build them could easily have resolved Albania's chronic shortage of housing. According to Josif Zagali, building twenty smaller bunkers cost as much as constructing a kilometre of road. It also had a human cost; 70–100 people a year died constructing the bunkers. In addition, the bunkers occupied and obstructed a significant area of arable land.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines how}} teenage {{drug and alcohol}} use responds to changes in the economy. In contrast to the recent literature confirming pro-cyclical alcohol use among adults, this research offers strong evidence that a <b>weaker</b> <b>economy</b> leads to greater teenage marijuana and hard-drug use and some evidence that a <b>weaker</b> <b>economy</b> also leads to higher teenage alcohol use. The findings are based on logistic models with state and year fixed effects, using teenagers from the NLSY- 1997. The evidence also indicates that teenagers are more likely to sell drugs in <b>weaker</b> <b>economies.</b> This suggests one mechanism for counter-cyclical drug use - that access to illicit drugs is easier when the <b>economy</b> is <b>weaker.</b> These results also suggest that the strengthening economy in the 1990 s mitigated what would otherwise have been much larger increases in teenage drug use.

40|$|The {{semantic}} of {{the terms}} “sustainable development” and “corporate social responsibility” have changed over time {{to a point where}} these concepts have become two interrelated processes for ensuring the far-reaching development of society. Their convergence has given dimension to the environmental and corporate regulation mechanisms in strong economies. This article deals with the question of how the ethos of this convergence could be incorporated into the self-regulation of businesses in <b>weak</b> <b>economies</b> where nonlegal drivers are either inadequate or inefficient. It proposes that the policies for this incorporation should be based on the precepts of meta-regulation that have the potential to hold force majeure, economic incentives, and assistance-related strategies to reach an objective from the perspective of <b>weak</b> <b>economies...</b>|$|R

Drawing from entrainment theory, we develop an expanded model of work-life conflict to contend that macro-level business cycles will influences {{the amount of time}} employees spent on both work and non-work activities. Focusing solely on those who are employed, we examine a large nationally representative data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We find that during economic booms, employees work more, and therefore spend less time with family, sleeping, and recreating. In contrast, in <b>weak</b> <b>economies,</b> employees spend less time working, and therefore spend more time sleeping, with family, and recreating. Thus, we extend theory on time-based work-to-family conflict, showing that there are benefits to <b>weak</b> <b>economies...</b>|$|R

Grahl argues that EU economic policy does not acknowledge these problems and therefore is doomed to failure. In particular German economic policy continues to make efforts to enhance its dominant position, with the inevitable result that other economics suffer. This has been made worse by the financial crisis, which has hit the <b>weaker</b> <b>economies</b> hardest. Short-term lending will not solve this problem, since the <b>weaker</b> <b>economies</b> may be facing problems of insolvency rather than liquidity.

Arguing in support for SNAP, the Food Research and Action Center argued that “putting more resources quickly {{into the hands of}} the people most likely to turn around and spend it can both boost the economy and cushion the hardships on vulnerable people who face a constant struggle against hunger.” Researchers have found that every $1 that is spent from SNAP results in $1.73 of economic activity. In California, the cost-benefit ratio is even higher: for every $1 spent from SNAP between $3.67 to $8.34 is saved in health care costs. The Congressional Budget Office also rated an increase in SNAP benefits as one of the two most cost-effective of all spending and tax options it examined for boosting growth and jobs in a <b>weak</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E
