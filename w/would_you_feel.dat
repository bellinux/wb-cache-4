500|$|Originally it wasn't {{going to}} have {{anything}} to do with that, but people were looking through my photo albums this year. My father and I had made some photo albums together of his relatives and different people in the family. A couple people saw [...] and they were like, 'This is amazing that you have this.' I guess everybody was like, 'How <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> about this type of concept ?' So I guess I thought if someone's going to do it might as well be me. The story line [...] is about an interracial couple. It's sort of Romeo and Juliet but it's set in the '60s and they're kind of torn apart. It's about their struggle and I'm sort of the narrator. I don't want to give too much away about it, but it's nice. Something I could relate to, being the product of an interracial union, though [...] did not wind up happily ever after standing in church together.|$|E
500|$|In {{adapting}} the film, a few adjustments were made, such as changing {{the names of}} the protagonists to Owen and Abby, and moving the setting from the Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg to [...] "a small New Mexico town." [...] Reeves was also asked to change the ages of the main characters, but he refused, saying that [...] "would ruin the essence of the story and change everything completely…we need that childlike innocence." [...] He also told his actors to not watch the original film beforehand so [...] "we could make our own version but stay very true to the essence of the story." [...] The filmmakers have noted that [...] "they intend to forge a unique identity for Let Me In, placing it firmly in an American context", {{while at the same time}} paying respect to the original. In comparing his adaptation to the Swedish one, Reeves admitted to not adding many different details from the book that weren't in the original film, stating that [...] "the story was so big that you couldn't really add a lot of stuff in without taking away the focus of the coming of age story so I tried to have allusions and references to stuff in the book." [...] Reeves also admitted to borrowing elements from the Swedish film, stating [...] "There are things that [...] adapted brilliantly in the movie and I borrowed from that because I thought he did a great adaptation. But there are some things that hopefully don't detract and fit into the context of the story. It's a mixture of details from the book, the original film and things that grew out of adapting it." [...] In {{adapting the}} story for American audiences, Reeves stated that keeping the 1980s time period within the film was critical in exploring the theme of good and evil. He used Ronald Reagan's [...] "evil empire speech" [...] as an example of American thought during that period. Reeves stated, [...] "The idea of Reagan's 'evil empire' speech and that whole sort of school of thought was that evil was something that was outside of us. Evil was 'Other,' it was over there, it was the Soviets". Reeves felt that this idea was central to the main character Owen, as he [...] "would be grappling with these very, very dark feelings but being in a kind of American town where there was that sort of [...] mindset and religiousness. How would you fit in? How <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> about yourself being confused and being 12 or 13 years old and not knowing what it means that you wish you could kill those kids who were terrorizing you every day? The humanity of that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gil Scott-Heron {{was born}} in Chicago, Illinois. His mother, Bobbie Scott-Heron, was an opera singer who {{performed}} with the New York Oratorio Society. Scott-Heron's father, Gil Heron, nicknamed [...] "The Black Arrow", was a Jamaican football player in the 1950s who {{became the first black}} man to play for Celtic Football Club in Glasgow. Gil's parents separated in his early childhood and he was sent to live with his maternal grandmother, Lillie Scott, in Jackson, Tennessee. When Scott-Heron was 12 years old, his grandmother died and he returned to live with his mother in The Bronx in New York City. He enrolled at DeWitt Clinton High School, but later transferred to The Fieldston School after impressing the head of the English department with one of his writings and earning a full scholarship. As one of five black students at the prestigious school, Scott-Heron was faced with alienation and a significant socioeconomic gap. During his admissions interview at Fieldston, an administrator asked him, [...] "'How <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> if you see one of your classmates go by in a limousine while you're walking up the hill from the subway?' And [...] said, 'Same way as you. Y'all can't afford no limousine. How do you feel?'" [...] This type of intractable boldness would become a hallmark of Scott-Heron's later recordings.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} {{successful}} mainstream Filipino-American rappers is The Black Eyed Peas's apl.de.ap, who has released songs such as [...] "The Apl Song" [...] (Elephunk), [...] "Bebot" [...] (Monkey Business), and [...] "Mare" [...] (The E.N.D.) which not only contain Filipino (Tagalog) lyrics but also native Filipino musical elements. Pineda has also founded his own record label, the Los Angeles-based Jeepney Music, to help discover and promote Filipino hip-hop talent from both the United States and the Philippines. [...] "The APL Song" [...] not only contains elements of Tagalog and Filipino elements, but the track itself according to video producer, Christina DeHaven, represents Allan Pineda Lindo's view of the Philippines when he travels back for the first time since he was 14 years old. In the English verses of the song Allan Pineda Lindo describes aspects of Filipino life back home which is seen in the lyrics, [...] "How <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> if you had to catch your meal, Build a hut to live and to eat and chill in, Having to pump the water outta the ground?". The shifting between Tagalog and English can be interpreted as showing both languages as equal or in an equal hierarchical relationship to one another which is especially important having included another language than English in American Pop song, even though English is one of two of the Official language's of the Philippines.|$|E
