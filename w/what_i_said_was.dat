25|$|As Shadow Chancellor in 1967 Iain Macleod {{helped to}} found the {{homeless}} charity Crisis. In 1968 Macleod defied a {{decision of the}} Shadow Cabinet by voting against the Labour Government’s Commonwealth Immigration Bill, believing {{it to be a}} breach of promises made by the Conservative Government to the Kenyan Asians. He fell out with his former friend Enoch Powell over the latter's 1968 Rivers of Blood speech, after which Macleod refused to speak to Powell again. Macleod's subsequent dealings with him were, Powell said, as if he was a pariah though Macleod 'knew <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> not motivated by what is crudely called racialism, but he behaved as if he did not know'. Powell's speech generated huge public support and Macleod was horrified at the open racism of many {{of the members of the}} public who wrote to him on the topic, likening them to the disgusting creatures which are revealed when one overturns a stone.|$|E
500|$|In {{announcing the}} tour, Bowie {{embarked}} {{on a series of}} promotional press shows covering 9 countries in 2 weeks, including Canada, the US and seven countries in Europe. The press tour shows were typically delivered in smaller venues seating around 300 people, and local fans were often allowed into the events. He used the opportunity to educate the press on his album and the tour, and the multiple dates allowed him to correct misinformation. At the London Glass Spider Press Conference, he clarified that [...] "I didn't say 'lights, costumes and sex,' <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> 'lights, costumes and theatrical sets {{in response to a question}} about what the audience could expect when seeing his new live show. Press tour shows included live performances of some of the songs from the album Never Let Me Down.|$|E
2500|$|King is {{a public}} critic of Paul LePage, the Republican Governor of Maine, and has {{referred}} to LePage {{as one of the}} Three Stooges, along with Florida Governor Rick Scott and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. [...] He was critical of LePage for incorrectly suggesting in a weekly radio address on March 18, 2015, that King avoided paying Maine income taxes by living out of state for part of the year. The statement was later corrected by the Governor's office but no apology was issued. [...] King said LePage was [...] "full of the stuff that makes the grass grow green" [...] and demanded that LePage [...] "man up and apologize". [...] LePage declined to apologize to King, stating [...] "I never said Stephen King did not pay income taxes. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>was,</b> Stephen King's not in Maine right now. That's what I said." [...] LePage further told King that he should [...] "make me the villain of your next book and I won’t charge you royalties".|$|E

5000|$|There {{were rumors}} of Hijazi criticising Nancy Ajram of singing on stage while pregnant. Hijazi has however denied the {{allegations}} stating, [...] "All <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>is</b> that <b>I</b> don’t find it {{fit for a}} pregnant singer to perform on stage. I didn’t hit on Nancy at all." ...|$|R
2500|$|At {{a private}} dinner in November 2014, Emil Michael, senior vice {{president}} of Uber, suggested that Uber hire a team of opposition researchers and journalists, with a million-dollar budget, to dig into the personal lives and backgrounds of media figures who reported negatively about Uber. Specifically, he targeted Sarah Lacy, editor of the technology website PandoDaily, who has accused Uber of sexism and misogyny. The controversy made national news and stirred criticism against Uber. [...] "The comments, reportedly made by {{senior vice president}} for business Emil Michael at a New York dinner attended by BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith," [...] wrote a Washington Post columnist, [...] "ignited a powder keg of criticism about a company already perceived as cut-throat – landing Uber on the front pages of The Washington Post, USA Today and The New York Times." [...] Michael issued a public apology. Later, he sent an email to Lacy: [...] "I was at an event and was venting, but <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> never intended to describe actions that would ever be undertaken by me or my company toward you or anyone else. I was definitively wrong and I feel terrible about any distress I have caused you." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2013 in Manassas, Jackson held a {{press conference}} in which he sought to clear the air about his past and counter what he called distortions of his past words and {{statements}} by his opponents. Jackson addressed a number of claims about his theology, which he says has been [...] "twisted and distorted," [...] and said, [...] "I'm not going to spend the campaign talking about these issues, so let's {{get it out of the}} way now." [...] Jackson also disclosed previously unreported details about his financial history and past drug use, saying he wanted to [...] "reveal as many of my weaknesses and shortcomings as a curious press and my opposition might want to look into," [...] and by doing so, [...] "maybe save you and your colleagues some further research." [...] In regards to claims that he thinks birth defects are caused by parents' sins, Jackson said, [...] "I do not believe that birth defects are caused by parents' sin unless, of course, there's a direct scientific connection between the parents' behavior and the disabilities of the child," [...] such as a child who might develop birth defects if his or her mother was addicted to heroin. He also denied that he had said yoga leads to Satanism: [...] "I do not believe that yoga leads to Satanism. One of my ministers is a yoga instructor. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> that Christian meditation does not involve emptying oneself but filling oneself ... with the spirit of God. That is classic Biblical Christianity." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I really {{beg your}} pardon, Miss Ashleigh," [...] he said, {{colouring}} {{almost as much}} as I had done, [...] "but I felt so much surprised for a moment at the change in you, that I was obliged to express myself in the most straightforward way: had <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>been</b> less true, <b>I</b> should have put it into some different form." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then she {{followed}} me to ... to your sister-in-law's. And {{she came up}} and made another scene. Then I lost my head.

6000|$|... "Stop a minute, Frank," [...] said Blake, [...] "and don't be in a passion. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> {{only meant}} {{to show you}} how easy I think it is for you to marry Miss Wyndham if you choose." ...|$|E

5000|$|Local {{councillor}} Roy Walters {{complained of}} the Moss Side unfairly being a [...] "negative target" [...] due to historical associations. Sticking by his comments, he said, [...] "I didn't say Moss Side equals Baltimore. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>is</b> {{that we have}} in Moss Side symptoms of a gang conflict in this country which I find profoundly disturbing". Baltimore, with a population of about 600,000, was noted as having 191 gun related murders in the past year, in comparison to Moss Side, which had none.|$|R

5000|$|For weeks, Lee {{attempted}} to countermand every desegregation order issued by Scott. Finally, Scott slapped contempt charges against Lee but revoked {{them in a}} bid to end the dispute over which school the girls would attend. According to the New York Times, Lee accused Scott of [...] "trying to blackmail me [...] [...] [...] I was a gentleman and did <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to do, and he backed out. He lied to me." ...|$|R

60|$|<b>What</b> <b>I</b> have <b>said</b> <b>is,</b> {{that the}} {{existence}} of such a class is a fact peculiar to American society, a clear, plain result of the new principles involved in the doctrine of universal equality.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly--excellent even; and I am much {{disposed}} {{to believe that}} you are one of that class." [...] Lowiny looked delighted; and I felt less reluctance at administering this flattery than might otherwise have been the case, from the circumstance that so much of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>was</b> really merited.|$|E

3000|$|According to {{the rules}} of case filing, a {{plaintiff}} needs to provide some evidence. 14 However, county courts are faced with a significant problem in that many plaintiffs only have the simple thought of “getting an objective judgment” and “asking for help”, rather than the sense of evidence required by the modern legal system. Plaintiffs usually do not have corresponding evidence. So, when a case-filing judge asks plaintiffs for evidence, they usually received unexpected answers. Judge H offered an example, describing a plaintiff who said: “Evidence? I don’t have evidence. The case is like this…Evidence? You just go to my village and ask. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>is</b> proof.” [...]...|$|R
5000|$|A local councillor, Roy Walters, {{complained of}} Moss Side unfairly being a [...] "negative target" [...] due to {{historical}} associations.
