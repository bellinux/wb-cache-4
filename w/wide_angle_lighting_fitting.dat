40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for {{the measurement of}} DNA index and cell cycle distribution in purified erythroid and myeloid populations from human bone marrow. Erythroid cells were prepared after complement mediated lysis of non-erythroid marrow cells. Myeloid cells were obtained by fluorescence activated cell sorting by forward and <b>wide</b> <b>angle</b> <b>light</b> scatter. Mononuclear marrow cells were prepared with a density gradient. Nuclei prepared from the separated populations were stained with propidium iodide. Myeloid cells had a higher DNA index than erythroid cells, and the mononuclear preparation had an intermediate value. There were more erythroid than myeloid cells in the S and G 2 M phases of the cell cycle. These lineage differences are particularly relevant when considering data derived from unseparated bone marrow cells, and further experiments are needed to determine the origin of these anomalies...|$|R

40|$|The {{investigation}} of the physical properties of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) is of great relevance, as they {{play a key role in}} regulating human body health. Here we report the possibility to characterize human PBMC in their physiological conditions in a microfluidic-based measurement system. A viscoelastic polymer solution is adopted for 3 D alignment of individual cells inflow. An optical signature (OS) acquisition of each flowing cell is performed using a <b>wide</b> <b>angle</b> <b>light</b> scattering apparatus. Besides, a quantitative phase imaging (QPI) holographic system is employed with the aim (i) to check the position in flow of individual cells using a holographic 3 D cell tracking method; and (ii) to estimate their 3 D morphometric features, such as their refractive index (RI). Results obtained by combining OS and QPI have been compared with literature values, showing good agreement. The results confirm the possibility to obtain sub-micrometric details of physical cell properties in microfluidic flow, avoiding chemical staining or fluorescent labelling...|$|R

40|$|AIMS/BACKGROUND: Many {{reports have}} {{indicated}} that some patients with cataract can retain good visual acuity but complain of significant visual problems. This {{is the first in}} a series of papers trying to determine what causes these symptoms and whether other clinical tests can predict the real world vision loss. METHODS: The effect of a cataract simulation with a similar angular distribution of light scatter as real cataract on clinical (visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and disability glare) and real world vision (face recognition, reading speed, and mobility orientation) was investigated. RESULTS: The simulation had a relatively small effect on visual acuity (6 / 6 with the simulation), but much larger effects on contrast sensitivity and low contrast acuity with and without glare. The simulation had no effect on high luminance and high contrast real world tasks, such as mobility orientation in room light and optimal reading speed. A small, but significant deterioration was found for the slightly lower contrast task of face and expression recognition. However, under low luminance conditions, substantial defects in mobility orientation were obtained (despite 6 / 6 acuity). CONCLUSIONS: Although the relative effect of the cataract simulation on acuity and contrast tasks is not typical of the average cataract, it can be found in those cataract patients with visual problems despite good visual acuity. This corroborates the suggestion that it is large amounts of <b>wide</b> <b>angle</b> <b>light</b> scatter (forward and/or backward) which are at least partly responsible for visual disability in cataract patients with good visual acuity. A patient's reported visual disability may depend on the percentage of time he or she spends under low contrast and/or low luminance conditions, such as walking or reading in dim illumination, and walking or driving at night, in fog, or heavy rain...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} {{freeform}} lenses and reflectors allows to achieve non-radially symmetric irradiance distributions whilst keeping the optical system compact. In {{the case of}} a point-like source, such as an LED, it is often desired to capture a <b>wide</b> <b>angle</b> of source <b>light</b> in order to increase optical efficiency. This generally results in strongly curved optics, requiring both lens surfaces to contribute to the total ray refraction, and thereby minimising Fresnel losses.

The shape and height of d-SMSs were designed {{on the basis of}} the calculation result from the rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) method. The d-SMSs with tapered shape were fabricated on the back side of SnO 2 :F covered glass substrate by plasma etching of thermally dewetted silver (Ag) nanoparticles without any lithography processes. The glass substrates with d-SMSs showed very low reflectance compared to that of the glass substrates with flat surface over a wide specular and angular range.

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 A {{system to}} perform neutron {{radiographic}} analysis of dynamic events taking {{place over the}} order of several milliseconds has been developed at Oregon State University. The design consists of a TRIGA reactor capable of pulsing to 3000 MW peak power, a neutron beam collimator with an L/D of about 30 : 1, a lithium fluoride-zinc sulphide (LiF-ZnS) neutron scintillator screen, an image intensifier and a 16 mm high speed movie camera. The TRIGA reactor pulse and beam port collimator combine to yield a peak thermal neutron flux of about 4. 2 x 10 ¹¹ n/cm ² -sec at the object with a pulse width (FWHM) of 9 milliseconds. During this pulse duration sequential neutron radiographs are taken by the imaging system which detail any movement occurring in the object. The imaging system operates by converting the neutron signal to light, amplifying the light signal and recording the information on 16 mm Rapid Arts Recording film. LiF-ZnS neutron scintillator screens of 2 / 1 weight ratio of ZnS to LiF and 0. 13 mm thickness constructed at OSU with sodium silicate binder {{are found to be}} very successful. The construction of the scintillators plus both an analytical model and experimental study of their performance is described. These screens have good light yield, good resolution and sufficiently rapid light decay characteristics to allow individual framing at over 5000 frames/second. The image intensifier is a two stage, 40 mm diameter tube. An 5 - 20 photocathode and a P- 11 output phosphor are employed in the intensifier for their rapid decay characteristics and spectral response. The tube has a fiber optics input faceplate onto which the scintillator screen is pressure held for radiography. Actual imaging through the intensifier is superior to the conventional scintillator screen in contact with film method, apparently due to the non acceptance of <b>wide</b> <b>angle</b> <b>light</b> by the fine fiber optics. The high speed movie camera focuses on the intensifier output screen. Modulation transfer function analysis of the system indicates that the scintillator screen and the collimator L/D ratio are the two weakest areas of image quality in the system. The intensifier and high speed camera exhibit much better quality. Image quality can also be subject to statistical limitations due to the very short exposure times (about 80 psec at 5000 frames/second) per frame in the imaging system. Experimental studies indicate that the image quality becomes statistically limited for general detail below about 10 ⁷ n/cm ² fluence incident on the object. Subject to the object thickness and level of detail desired, the OSU system may be operated at up to 10, 000 frames/second without experiencing this problem. For fine detail though it is necessary to enhance the object contrast by appropriate doping with a high contrast material such as gadolinium. This high speed motion neutron radiography technique may be applied to the interrogation of rapid dynamic events that have imaging characteristics suitable for neutron radiography inspection. High speed motion neutron radiographs have been taken of the ballistic cycle of both live and blank 7. 62 mm munition rounds and of two phase flow as represented by air bubbles passing through water...|$|R
