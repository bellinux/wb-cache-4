5|$|In February 1920, a Notice to Airmen {{was issued}} advising pilots {{that had made}} {{emergency}} landings at Penshurst that they could use the War Office telephone to inform the police of their arrival and to obtain conveyances for their passengers {{to take them to}} Penshurst station. On 5 June 1920, the first air mail flight between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom was made. Bert Hinchcliffe departed from Schiphol in a hired Airco DH.9 with 300 letters on board. Despite the bad weather, Hinchcliffe decided not to land at Lympne and pressed on towards Croydon. He was eventually forced to land at Penshurst due to a combination of the weather and running low on fuel. A taxi was hired to take Hinchcliffe and the letters on to London. A linen <b>windsock</b> was installed at Penshurst in November 1920. The War Office telephone was notified as having been discontinued in January 1921. On 24 September 1921, a de Havilland DH.18 aircraft diverted to Penshurst as Croydon was fogbound.|$|E

25|$|The {{summit of}} Brace {{is an open}} area with scrubby forest on the slopes. A cairn several feet high, with a small <b>windsock</b> attached, sits on the highest ground. There are views {{available}} in all directions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Windsocks</b> {{are used}} to tell wind speed and the {{direction}} of the wind speed itself. <b>Windsocks</b> typically are used at airports to indicate the direction and strength of the wind to pilots and at chemical plants where there is risk of gaseous leakage. They are sometimes located alongside highways at windy locations.|$|R
50|$|At many airports, <b>windsocks</b> are lighted at night, {{either by}} flood lights on top {{surrounding}} it or with one {{mounted on the}} pole shining inside it.|$|R
50|$|Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) is {{available}} for both ends and low-intensity runway lights can be activated by radio (Pilot Controlled Lighting). Two illuminated <b>windsocks</b> are on site.|$|R
25|$|The {{control tower}} {{was located in}} a cabin which was placed on a hill shelf {{overlooking}} the quay at Hjellestad. A radio mast was erected at Sandkleivane and a <b>windsock</b> installed don Kuholmen. Non-directional beacons were installed at Espeland and Bjelkarøy. Ship traffic near Hjellestad had to be alerted in case of incoming flights; this was announced through the hoisting of a black and yellow ball on the flag pole at the control tower.|$|E
500|$|The {{next day}} they {{went to work on}} the {{airstrip}} with hand tools. Trees were felled, potholes filled in and a <b>windsock</b> erected. Fourteen gliders were supposed to fly in three light tractors, three mowers, a wheeled rake and other engineering equipment from Dobodura. Because the lack of opposition made immediate resupply non-urgent, and because he had doubts about the proficiency of the glider pilots, whom he knew had undergone only minimal training, General Blamey decided that the glider operation was not worth the risk to the glider pilots or their passengers and cancelled it, substituting instead the afternoon supply run by specially modified B-17s. Lacking mowers, the Kunai grass was cut by hand by the pioneers, sappers, paratroops and native civilians and burned, causing the destruction of some stores and equipment that had been lost in the long grass and [...] "a swirl of black dust". By 11:00 on 6 September, the [...] strip— which had not been used for over a year— had been extended to [...]|$|E
500|$|In 1920, an {{airfield}} {{was established}} at Saint-Inglevert {{on a different}} site to the former military airfield. Facilities developed {{over the years to}} include two hangars, customs facilities and ultra short wave radio. In March 1920, a Notice to Airmen was issued stating that Saint-Inglevert was open and fuel, oil and water were available, but there were no hangars or repair facilities. A proposal to designate Saint-Inglevert as a customs airfield in order to relieve Le Bourget of some of its workload was made in April 1920. Facilities then in existence included hangars, repair facilities and a radio station. Later that month, it was notified that an aerial lighthouse had been installed at the airfield, flashing the Morse letter A, and Saint-Inglevert became a customs airport on 20 May. By July, the provision of ground signals at Saint-Inglevert had begun. A [...] arrow was displayed indicating the wind direction. In August, it was reported that Saint-Inglevert was sending weather report by radio seven times a day to Le Bourget. By October, aids available included a <b>windsock</b> and a landing T. Requirements for aircraft to perform clockwise or anticlockwise circuits when landing were indicated by the flying of a red or white flag respectively. The aerial lighthouse was reported to be out of action in November 1920.|$|E

5|$|Wind {{direction}} is usually {{expressed in terms}} of the direction from which it originates. For example, a northerly wind blows from the north to the south. Weather vanes pivot to indicate the direction of the wind. At airports, <b>windsocks</b> indicate wind direction, and {{can also be used to}} estimate wind speed by the angle of hang. Wind speed is measured by anemometers, most commonly using rotating cups or propellers. When a high measurement frequency is needed (such as in research applications), wind can be measured by the propagation speed of ultrasound signals or by the effect of ventilation on the resistance of a heated wire. Another type of anemometer uses pitot tubes that take advantage of the pressure differential between an inner tube and an outer tube that is exposed to the wind to determine the dynamic pressure, which is then used to compute the wind speed.|$|R
40|$|Despite an upsurge of {{interest}} in spatial interactions between communities and in the impact of dispersal on ecological and evolutionary processes, dispersal patterns and dynamics in natural metacommunities remain poorly understood. Although passive aerial dispersal of freshwater invertebrates is generally accepted, the frequency and relative importance of wind as a vector is still subject of considerable debate. We assessed the importance of wind dispersal in an invertebrate metacommunity in a cluster of 36 temporary rock pools on an isolated mountaintop in South Africa. Wind dispersal was quantified every four days using nine <b>windsocks</b> (about 1. 5 m above rock base), placed in the field during one month. Distance to the nearest pool varied from 2 up to 16 m. Wind direction and speed were monitored for the entire period. About 850 propagules (mostly resting eggs) of 17 taxa were captured. The presence {{of water in the}} pools (level of exposure of the dormant propagule bank) and the dominant wind direction were the key factors affecting the yield. Wind speed was much less important. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Current {{evidence}} suggests regular overland transport of different freshwater invertebrates by wind, mainly over short distances. Yet, {{very little is}} known about the mechanism and scale of this process or about differences in wind dispersal dynamics and capacities among taxa and propagule types. We investigated wind dispersal of freshwater invertebrates in a cluster of temporary rock pools (spatial scale: 9, 000 m(2)) in South Africa. Dispersing propagules and propagule bank fragments (i. e. aggregates of sediments and propagules) were intercepted during 1 month using a combination of <b>windsocks</b> (1. 5 m above ground level) and sticky traps (ground level). The potential movement of propagule bank fragments (i. e. aggregates of propagules and sediments) was also simulated by tracking inter-pool movements of differently sized artificial substrate fragments similar to dry propagule bank fragments. We detected differences in the composition of dispersing communities intercepted at different altitudes (ground level and at 1. 5 m). Comparison of dispersal distance distributions also revealed significant differences among taxa. Overall, larger propagule types (e. g. adult ostracods and oribatid mites) dominantly travelled near ground level while small resting eggs and cryptobiotic life stages of copepods were most frequently collected at higher altitudes (1. 5 m) and dispersed over the longest distances. Finally, not only dispersal of single propagules but also ground level transport of propagule bank fragments was shown to contribute to local dispersal dynamics in temporary aquatic habitats. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|Once {{the line}} was on the market, a {{vigorous}} merchandising campaign took place, with DC Comics and Kenner striving for the Super Powers logo to become ubiquitous. DC Comics produced three comic book mini-series featuring characters from the toyline, one during each year of the toyline's existence. The first series of comics in 1984 was plotted by Jack Kirby, who also provided covers, {{who went on to}} pencil the second series. The third and final series was penciled by Carmine Infantino. These comics were separate from the continuity of the regular comics featuring the characters. Hanna Barbera also produced two animated series (a refreshing of the venerable Super Friends concept), called Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show and The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians. Warner Home Video used the opportunity to issue episodes of Superman, Batman, Superboy, and Aquaman produced by Filmation in 1966 on VHS and Betamax video cassette in 1985 under the Super Powers label (and also as part of the 50th anniversary celebrations of their sister company DC Comics), reissuing them again on VHS in 1996 (and were still available into the early 2000s {{until the end of the}} VHS format). Other tie-in products were produced, including lunchboxes, 3-D puffy stickers, party supplies, paintable figurines, Underoos, coloring and activity books (Secret of the Frozen City, Superman, Lex Luthor, The Joker, Batman, The Penguin, Wonder Woman, Villains, Superman and Batman, and Superman and the Super Powers), The Super Powers Anti-Coloring Book by Susan Striker, Stain-A-Sticker, Justice League of America Skyscraper Caper game, sunglasses, playhouses, belt buckles, sneakers, signature stamp sets, coloring play mats, drinking glasses/tumblers, model kits, soap, stain painting sets, calendars, Play-Doh sets, cube game, jointed wall figures, wrist watches, jigsaw puzzles (Jaymar and Craftmaster), Give-A-Show projectors, backpacks, gym bags, Valentine's Day paraphernalia, kites, pajamas, card games, sticker albums, sleeping bags, wall cling decorations, inflatable punching bop bags, bed sheets, clothes, <b>windsocks,</b> greeting cards, View-Master theatre sets, nut and fruit mix, sidewalk artist sets, temporary tattoos, SunShiners, galoshes, Nerf wrist flyers, duffel bags, lip balm, slippers, crayon sets, planners, school supplies, belts, baseball caps, flashlights, bumper stickers, pins, jewelery, embroidered patches, and posters. Kenner offered several mail-in promotions including a flexible vinyl record called The Darkseid Saga, child-size Superman plastic cape, and an 18" [...] by 24 [...] " [...] color poster.|$|R

Track racing uses an artificial lure (now based on a <b>windsock)</b> that travels ahead of the dogs on a rail until the greyhounds cross the finish line. As with horse racing, greyhound races often allow the public to bet on the outcome. In coursing the dogs chase a lure (originally a live hare or rabbit that could be killed by the dog).|$|E
