Detailing the song's recording process to MTV, Big Sean said, [...] "Me and [...] was in the studio working on {{a whole bunch of}} ideas and [...] came in the conversation. And everybody know Rick Ross albums is events. So Ye pulled a track up, and I was telling him I think it's a banger, it's a smash, and he thought <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>give</b> it to Rozay.

500|$|In January 2008, Tao became {{embroiled in}} {{controversy}} after the Singapore Swimming Association (SSA) introduced a 15% levy on the cash awards given to swimmers, with about 6% {{set aside for}} youth development. As part of the government's Multi-Million Dollar Award Programme (MAP), she received S$23,750 for winning three individual titles and one team gold at the 2007 SEA Games. She was therefore [...] "taxed" [...] S$3,562.50, with S$1,425 going to youth development. Unhappy with this, Tao said: [...] "If they [...] want to cultivate youth, they should find their own money, not pay using our awards. It's through our hard work that we got the money. So, I don't see the point that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>give</b> {{the money to the}} youths." [...] She itereited that it [...] been her school and not the SSA which had borne the expense of her overseas training. The SSA said it was [...] "very disappointed" [...] with her comments, and pointed out that the association had spent [...] "easily in excess of $20,000" [...] in sending her for competitions abroad such as the World Championships, Hong Kong Open and Japan International, and a stint at the Australian Institute of Sport. SSA Vice-President Oon Jin Gee told the press, [...] "Even with the Sports School funding it, it's our taxpayers' dollars going into her development. It doesn't matter which avenue it comes from, it's still Singapore's support for her." ...|$|E

40|$|Perhaps we tend {{to think}} of this {{epidemic}} in more monolithic terms than <b>we</b> <b>should,</b> <b>given</b> this great diversity of substances that it encompasses, but on the other hand it may make sense, not only in facilitating discourse about this complex, multidimensional social problem, but also because the many different drug-using behaviors do in fact tend to clump together and do seem to have some orderly temporal connections among themselves. Many investigators, for instance, have demonstrated that these many different forms of illicit substance use correlate fairly strongly with each other, and further, that there tends to be some orderliness in the way individuals progress through these experiences (e. g., Johnston, 1973; Kandel, 1975...|$|R

2500|$|Carter {{chose to}} focus on a tautological aspect of his ideas, which has {{resulted}} in much confusion. In fact, anthropic reasoning interests scientists because of something that is only implicit in the above formal definitions, namely that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>give</b> serious consideration to there being other universes with different values of the [...] "fundamental parameters"—that is, the dimensionless physical constants and initial conditions for the Big Bang. Carter and others have argued that {{life as we know it}} would not be possible in most such universes. In other words, the universe we are in is fine tuned to permit life. Collins & Hawking (1973) characterized Carter's then-unpublished big idea as the postulate that [...] "there is not one universe but a whole infinite ensemble of universes with all possible initial conditions". If this is granted, the anthropic principle provides a plausible explanation for the fine tuning of our universe: the [...] "typical" [...] universe is not fine-tuned, but given enough universes, a small fraction thereof will be capable of supporting intelligent life. Ours must be one of these, and so the observed fine tuning should be no cause for wonder.|$|E
2500|$|Romero preached that [...] "The most {{profound}} social revolution is the serious, supernatural, interior reform of a Christian." [...] He also emphasized: [...] "The liberation of Christ and of His Church is not {{reduced to the}} dimension of a purely temporal project. It does not reduce its objectives to an anthropocentric perspective: to a material well-being or only to initiatives of a political or social, economic or cultural order. Much less can it be a liberation that supports or is supported by violence." [...] Romero expressed several times his disapproval for divisiveness in the Church. In a sermon preached on 11 November 1979 he said: [...] "The other day, one of the persons who proclaims liberation in a political sense was asked: ‘For you, {{what is the meaning}} of the Church’?" [...] He said that the activist [...] "answered with these scandalous words: ‘There are two churches, the church of the rich and the church of the poor. We believe in the church of the poor but not in the church of the rich.’" [...] Romero declared, [...] "Clearly these words are a form of demagogy and I will never admit a division of the Church." [...] He added, [...] "There is only one Church, the Church that Christ preached, the Church to which <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>give</b> our whole hearts. ...There is only one Church, a Church that adores the living God and knows how to give relative value to the goods of this earth." ...|$|E
