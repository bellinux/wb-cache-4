[...] "I feel that I simply have lost some of the enthusiasm and inspiration needed to participate in a band that has grown from a few guys playing the music we love to a worldwide industry." [...] Ex-Arch Enemy guitarist Fredrik Åkesson replaced Lindgren, as Åkerfeldt explained [...] "Fredrik was the only name that popped up thinking about a replacement for Peter. In my opinion he's one of the top three guitar players out of Sweden. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>get</b> along great as we've known each other for maybe four years and he already has the experience to take on the circus-like lifestyle we lead as members of Opeth." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Jealous" [...] was {{initially}} conceived when Boots {{first saw it}} and the song consisted of [...] "some drums and that synth". He added a [...] "high" [...] melody containing the lines [...] "If you're keeping your promise I'm keeping mine" [...] as he felt it seemed [...] "like a shame something more melodic didn't happen in the song". When Beyoncé's creative team was widely searching for {{the concept of the}} song's music video, the singer sent a clip of a song called [...] "Roach Cock" [...] by Hanni El Khatib to Boots. Inspired by its feel, she requested from him to bring elements of that track to [...] "Jealous". He added a [...] "gnarly fuzz guitar ripping in the background" [...] to the song also present in its final version. Beyoncé explained the meaning of [...] "Jealous" [...] on her iTunes Radio channel, [...] " [...] a song about being human. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>get</b> jealous. It doesn't matter who you are.

500|$|After English {{actor and}} comedian Russell Brand {{divorced}} Perry in late December 2011, {{she was so}} distraught over the event that she considered committing suicide. Greg Wells, who assisted Perry with the composition of [...] "By the Grace of God", commented on the situation: [...] "I think she felt so kicked {{in the head and}} so publicly embarrassed at being divorced by a text message". After overcoming her suicidal thoughts and initial shock, she felt prompted to create a [...] "darker" [...] project as compared to her previous albums. Instead, she channelled the entire divorce event into [...] "By the Grace of God", in which its lyrics depict Perry battling against her suicidal thoughts while lying on her bathroom floor. During an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Perry spoke on how she felt during the breakup: [...] "Imagine what you go through. Imagine what happens when you go through a break up. We all go through break ups and <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>get</b> very depressed and desperate." ...|$|E

In February 1987 he joined Dylan, John Fogerty and Jesse Ed Davis on stage for a two-hour performance with the blues musician Taj Mahal. Harrison recalled: [...] "Bob rang me up and asked if I wanted to come out for the evening and see Taj Mahal... So we went there and had a few of these Mexican beers – and had a few more... Bob says, 'Hey, why don't <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>get</b> up and play, and you can sing?'

500|$|According to the Los Angeles Times, Lewis was {{inspired}} by house parties at Jonathan Wilson's Laurel Canyon home. [...] "We'd go to these jams in the canyon. They're fantastic. Jonathan invites older session musicians from the real Laurel Canyon era, and younger {{people who are just}} starting their bands who happen to live in the canyon, and <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>get</b> together and sing Grateful Dead covers and J. J. Cale songs." [...] Lewis herself has said that it [...] "rocks a little harder," [...] in contrast to Rabbit Fur Coats folk rock influences. Lewis also used Rilo Kiley's Under the Blacklight, which was notably polished compared to the band's earlier work, [...] "as a reference point to go in the complete opposite direction". She explained that every song she writes is [...] "a response to the thing that I've written before". [...] "It's even as simple as, 'OK, I've written a ballad, now I want to push myself to write something that's up tempo.' If I'm writing about myself, well, that subject can be tiresome, so then I focus on character-driven songs. So I'm always doing this back-and-forth just to keep myself interested." ...|$|E
500|$|Rising {{standards}} of achievement at Dartington enabled Imogen to organise performances of more demanding works, such as Bach's Mass in B minor in July 1950 to honour the 200th anniversary of Bach's death. Three years in preparation, this endeavour brought a tribute {{from one of}} the audience: [...] "I don't know, and can't imagine what the music of heaven is like. But when <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>get</b> there, please God, if any conducting is still necessary I hope your services will be required and that I will be in the chorus". By the middle of 1950 Imogen's professional focus was changing. She had attended the first two Aldeburgh Festivals in 1948 and [...] 1949, and in 1950 accepted a commission [...] to provide a choral work for performance at the 1951 festival. Sensing {{that it was time to}} leave Dartington, she gave a year's notice, part of which was spent on sabbatical, studying Indian music at Rabindranath Tagore's university in West Bengal. A fruit of this visit was her Ten Indian Folk Tunes for recorder. On 21 July 1951 her one-act opera, Benedick and Beatrice, was performed at Dartington, to mark her departure.|$|E

Meanwhile, the 40th Infantry Division (doubled to 4,000 troops) of the California Army National Guard continued to move into the city in Humvees, eventually seeing 10,000 Army National Guard troops activated. Additionally, a varied contingent of 1,700 federal law enforcement officers from different agencies across the state began to arrive, to protect federal facilities and assist local police.

It's very frail, nothing might happen, and now the band are all flipping out on me." [...] On May 1, in an interview with Pitchfork, Love discussed the possibility of a reunion, and also stated it had been [...] "a mistake" [...] releasing Nobody's Daughter as a Hole record in 2010. [...] "Eric was right—I kind of cheapened the name, even though I'm legally allowed to use it. I should save [...] "Hole" [...] for the lineup everybody wants to see and had the balls to put Nobody's Daughter under my own name." [...] Love further discussed the possibility of reuniting the band, saying: No one's been dormant. Patty teaches drumming and drums in three indie bands. Melissa has her metal-nerd thing going on—her dream is to play Castle Donington with Dokken. Eric hasn't flipped—I jammed with him, he's still doing his Thurston -crazy tunings, still corresponding with Kevin Shields. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>get</b> along great.
