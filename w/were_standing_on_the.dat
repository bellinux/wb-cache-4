5|$|And then it grew dark {{again with}} a squall, this time even {{stronger}} and worse than before. And {{right at the beginning}} of the squall Hávard the Hewing saw that two women <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> earl's ship, and both were doing the same thing that Thorgerd had done before.|$|E
5|$|When Carpathia {{arrived at}} Pier54 in New York {{on the evening}} of 18April after a {{difficult}} voyage through pack ice, fog, thunderstorms and rough seas, some 40,000people <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wharves, alerted to the disaster by a stream of radio messages from Carpathia and other ships. It was only after Carpathia docked– three days after Titanics sinking– that the full scope of the disaster became public knowledge.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} which Dave starts listing to Hurley why the island events are {{occurring}} in his mind suffered from continuous interruption, as military exercises on Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam led to many takes being ruined by plane noises. Weather problems also plagued production, with loud waves causing Hurley's and Libby's beach scene to be redubbed in post-production, and rain on one day changing {{the location of the}} basketball game scene to an indoor court, and also leading to a second day of filming on the cliff. The cliff was digitally redesigned in post-production to appear as if the actors <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge. Dave's jump was done by making a stunt double jump in front of a bluescreen, with the body hitting the water and resulting splash being rendered through computer graphics. The mental hospital was shot at the Laniakea YWCA in Honolulu, except for Dr. Brooks's office, which was done inside a studio.|$|E

25|$|The window {{paintings}} of the west choir were created from an unknown glass painting workshop in close consultation with the building workshop of the Naumburg Master, together creating unity and harmony. This becomes evident by the designs of {{the images of the}} saints that correspond with the founders’ sculptures in many aspects like positions, gestures and weapons. The portrayal of ten bishops of Naumburg {{at the bottom of the}} window rows creates the impression as if the statues of the founders <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same level as the medals. The glass paintings count among the most significant glass {{paintings of}} their style from the 13th century.|$|E
25|$|However, the Duke of Perth {{seems to}} have misinterpreted Murray's actions as only a general advance, and the Macdonalds {{on the far left}} simply ignored him. The result was the skewing of the Jacobite front line, with the (left wing) Macdonalds still rooted on the Culloden Parks wall and the (right wing) Atholl Brigade halfway down the Culwhiniac Parks wall. In consequence, large gaps {{immediately}} appeared in the severely over-stretched Jacobite lines. A shocked Sullivan {{had no choice but to}} position the meagre 'second line' to fill the gaps. This second line was (left to right): the Irish Picquets; the Duke of Perth's Regiment; Glenbuchat's; Lord Kilmarnock's Footguards; John Roy Stuart's Regiment; two battalions of Lord Ogilvy's Regiment; the Royal Écossais; two battalions of Lord Lewis Gordon's Regiment. Farther back were cavalry units. On the left were: Lord Strathallan's Horse Bagot's Hussars and possibly Balmerino's Lifeguards. On the right were Lord Elcho's Lifeguards and Fitzjames's Horse. And in the centre was Charles Edward Stuart's tiny escort made up of Fitzjames's Horse and Lifeguards. When Sullivan's redeployment was completed Perth's and Glenbuchat's regiments <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> extreme left wing and John Roy Stuart's was standing beside Ardsheal's.|$|E

500|$|After a hiatus, Partridge {{returned}} in 2010 {{in a series}} of YouTube shorts, Mid Morning Matters with Alan Partridge, as the host of a digital radio show with co-presenter Sidekick Simon (Tim Key). Coogan co-wrote the shorts with brothers Neil and Rob Gibbons, who submitted scripts to his company Baby Cow Productions; the Gibbons have co-written every Partridge project since. According to Neil, Coogan [...] "invited us in, our sensibilities chimed, and before we knew it, Mid Morning Matters was up and running. We wrote it as if it was our baby, and though {{there was a sense that}} we <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shoulders of giants, I think we were like two pairs of fresh eyes, and Steve seemed to fall in love with the character all over again." [...] Coogan said they chose the web format because [...] "it was a bit underground, a low-key environment in which to test the character out again. And the response was so good, we realised there was more fuel in the tank." [...] The shorts were later broadcast by Sky Atlantic.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the exchanges}} and {{distress}} signal, Sydney positioned herself {{just off the}} raider's starboard beam on a parallel course, approximately [...] from Kormoran. The cruiser {{may or may not}} have been at action stations: the main guns and port torpedo launcher were trained on Kormoran and her Walrus scout plane had been readied for launch, prompting Detmers to prepare to engage Sydney, but her [...] guns were unmanned, and personnel <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper deck. During her manoeuvre, Sydney appeared to signal [...] "IK" [...] (the short-form for [...] "You should prepare for a cyclone, hurricane, or typhoon"), which Kormoran did not respond to, as from their perspective, such a signal did not make sense. The Germans were unaware that the letters were the interior of the real Straat Malakkas secret callsign, [...] "IIKP": to verify her identity, the ship had to signal back the outer letters. The aircraft was shut down by 17:25, and the catapult swung into the storage position; the two ships were too close for a safe launch.|$|E
2500|$|At around 17:00, Detmers {{instructed}} his wireless {{operators to}} send a distress signal indicating Straat Malakka was being approached by a suspicious ship. Transmitted at 17:03 and repeated at 17:05, it contained the distress call for a merchantman under attack from a raider, rather than a warship (QQQQ as opposed to RRRR), the latitude and longitude of the transmitting ship, the time per Greenwich Mean Time instead of local time (a deliberate error to let the Kriegsmarine know a raider was likely about to be lost), and her name. This message was partially received by the tugboat Uco ("QQQQ [...] 1000 GMT") and a shore station at Geraldton, Western Australia (" [...] 7C 11115E 1000 GMT"). The Geraldton station broadcast a message to all ships asking {{if there was anything}} to report, which was interpreted by the Germans as acknowledgement of their signal. During the exchanges and distress signal, Sydney positioned herself off the raider's starboard beam on a parallel course, approximately [...] from Kormoran. Her main guns and torpedoes trained on the raider, but secondary weapons {{did not appear to be}} manned, personnel <b>were</b> <b>standing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper deck, and although the cruiser's seaplane had been readied for launch, it was soon stowed away. During her manoeuvre, Sydney signalled [...] "IK", which made no sense from the Germans' perspective, as that combination was shorthand for [...] "You should prepare for a cyclone, hurricane, or typhoon". However, those two letters were part of the real Straat Malakkas secret secondary callsign, and Sydney was expecting the ship to confirm her identity by responding with the callsign's other two letters.|$|E
