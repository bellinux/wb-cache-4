The influence of difference <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> to the weights of a panicle and of panicles per hill was clearly observed (Table 1). 2. Not only weight of a panicle but also a number of panicles per hill were decreased for the plots where <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> was kept high during night.

A significant number of influencing factors with different levels of impact on the <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> profile, and dynamic <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> behaviour of rivers, must be considered. Critical factors represent air temperature, shade caused by riparian vegetation, flow velocity and solar radiation. In order to obtain exact <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> values, on-site measurements have to be performed, however, {{it is not possible}} to equip every segment of the river with measuring stations. Therefore, the main goal of this project is the development of a GIS-based <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> interpolation model that estimates the <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> in rivers. Essential for this GIS-based model is the detailed definition of influencing factors and its spatial representation for developing an analysis model.

Segment points are set where tributaries join the major river, and therefore cause a mixing due to different <b>water</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Every segment with the calculated values regarding hydrology, geometry, meteorology, as well as shade, serves as an input for the applied <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> interpolation tool “Stream Segment Temperature Model” (SSTEMP).

A resampling methodology applied to 10 -minute <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> data was performed to assess the quality of the different estimators used to calculate the annual mean <b>water</b> <b>temperature.</b> Only one of the three estimators used could be considered to be unbiased. Another estimator could be corrected by estimating its bias. As a result, it was possible to reconstruct a <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> series from 1949 to 2000, with a gap in the period 1978 - 1995. The serie...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{some of the}} morphological, hydraulic, thermal and meteorological {{characteristics of}} the experimental field channels at the USEPA Monticello Ecological Research Station. It contains an,overview of measurements and parameters which characterized the physical operation, conditions of the channels from December 1975 through December 1977. Reported herein are measured values of hydraulic channel roughness, permeability and porosity of rock sections, and thermal diffusivity of bed materials. Recorded <b>water</b> <b>temperatures</b> have been statistically analyzed to. give local diel, longitudinal, and vertical <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> variations. A data bank of 3 -hour <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> data was established. Mean, standard deviation, skewness, and <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> values at 5 per cent and 95 per cent probability of occurrence have been calculated on sliding, weekly samples of these 3 -hour data. Various aspects of the <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> regime of the experimental field channels of the USEPA Monticello Ecological Research Station (MERS) were studied theoretically. Longitudinal dispersion and heat transfer relationships which were included in a dynamic <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> model had to be established. <b>Water</b> <b>temperatures</b> at various channel locations and meteorological parameters were continuously recorded. A convective water surface heat transfer relationship (wind function) was determined from the recorded longitudinal temperature profile and meteorological parameters during quasi-steady state periods. Progressive heat fronts were used with tracer theory to determine longitudinal dispersion coefficients for the field channels. The wind function and the longitudinal dispersion coefficient were incorporated in an implicit finite difference computer model, MNSTREM, for the highly dynamic <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> prediction in the very shallow field channels. The <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> model results were verified against 3 -hour <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> measurements over four time periods of up to one month.

40|$|Although {{changes in}} <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> {{influence}} {{the rates of}} many ecosystem processes in lakes, knowledge of the <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> regime for large floodplain lake systems subjected to multiple stressors has received little attention. The coupled models can serve to derive more knowledge on the <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> impact on lake ecosystems. For this purpose, we used a physically-based hydrodynamic model coupled with a transport model to examine the spatial and temporal behavior and primary causal factors of <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> within the floodplain of Poyang Lake that is representative of shallow and large lakes in China. Model performance is assessed through comparison with field observations and remote sensing data. The daily <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> variations within Poyang Lake were reproduced reasonably well by the hydrodynamic model, with the root mean square errors of 1. 5 – 1. 9 °C. The modeling {{results indicate that the}} <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> exhibits distinct spatial and temporal variability. The mean seasonal <b>water</b> <b>temperatures</b> vary substantially from 29. 1 °C in summer to 7. 7 °C in winter, with the highest value in August and the lowest value in January. Although the degree of spatial variability differed considerably between seasons, the <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> generally decreases from the shallow floodplains to the main flow channels of the lake. As expected, the lake <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> is primarily affected by the air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed and the inflow temperature, whereas other factors such as cloud cover, relative humidity, precipitation, evaporation and lake topography may play a complementary role in influencing temperature. The current work presents a first attempt to use a coupled model approach, which is therefore a useful tool to investigate the <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> behavior and its major causal factors for a large floodplain lake system. It would have implications for improving the understanding of Poyang Lake <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> and supporting planning and management of the lake, its water quality and ecosystem functioning...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe growing {{recognition}} of the ecological and water quality significance of river <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> led to {{a large number of}} studies assessing thermal processes in streams and rivers. Yet, thermal processes in abandoned channels, which {{play an important role in}} maintaining water quality and biological diversity in fluvial corridors, have received minor attention. This study evaluates <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> regimes in three abandoned channels of the Allier River, France, and quantifies the regime sensitivity to climatic (air temperature) and hydrological (surface and subsurface flow) influence. Analysis was conducted at annual and daily scales, and at two distinct sections of each abandoned channel: (i) the downstream section, which is well connected to the main stream channel, and (ii) the upstream section, which is poorly connected to the main stream channel and hence subject to greater influence of subsurface flow. Annual and daily <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> regimes for all channels and sections were classified based on relative differences in the 'shape' (timing) and the 'magnitude' (size) of the thermographs. The climatic and hydrological sensitivity of <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> regimes was quantified using a Sensitivity Index. Analysis at the annual scale revealed relative similarity in patterns of thermal response over time, with clear differentiation between upstream and downstream channel sections in all sites. <b>Water</b> <b>temperature</b> regimes in the upstream channel sections were strongly linked to subsurface <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> in terms of both timing and size of the annual thermograph; <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> regimes in the downstream channel sections were more sensitive to air and river <b>water</b> <b>temperature,</b> especially regarding the timing of the annual regimes. Although annual regimes of <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> exhibited distinct patterns that were similar across sites and over time, analysis of daily <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> regimes revealed broad differences within and between sites. Day-today sequencing of similar classes of diurnal regime varied over the year, and between consecutive years. Furthermore, the direction and strength of climatic and hydrological sensitivity of daily <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> regimes varied over time, and between sites. Temporal and spatial variability of diurnal regime class sequencing and sensitivity indicates complex climatic and hydrologic influence on <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> variability, strongly related to the morphology of each site. Identifying thresholds of climatic and hydrologic influence, as well as temporal and spatial variations in the strength of climatic and hydrologic influence, is the key to further development of predictive models of <b>water</b> <b>temperature</b> in the abandoned channels of the Allier River...|$|R
