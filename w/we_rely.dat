25|$|When {{a law of}} Torah {{conflicts}} with morality, when the law is 'unpleasant', {{we are committed to}} finding a way to address the problem. As a halakhic movement we look to precedent to find the tools with which to shape the Torah. For the most part, <b>we</b> <b>rely</b> on the strategies of old. At the same time, we are willing to do explicitly what was largely implicit in the past, namely, to make changes on moral grounds.|$|E

Koenigsberger {{comments}} in Leaving Springfield that [...] "a {{good deal of}} enjoyment" [...] is to be had from the episode, due to [...] "the exposure of the hypocrisy behind 'the finance of salvation' and the ambivalent operations of the commercial world". Don Cupitt, a fellow of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, believes that when Lisa lectures Bart about the soul, she [...] "shows a degree of theological sophistication which is simply not tolerated in Britain." [...] Paul Bloom and David Pizarro wrote in The Psychology of The Simpsons that although Lisa does show [...] "healthy religious skepticism" [...] she still believes in an eternal soul. However, Lisa tells Bart {{at the end of}} the episode, [...] "some philosophers believe that no one is born with a soul, you have to earn one through suffering". Bloom and Pizarro acknowledge: [...] "Indeed, some philosophers and theologians say that without belief in a soul, one cannot make sense of the social concepts on which <b>we</b> <b>rely,</b> such as personal responsibility and freedom of the will." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} release of Moving Notepad in Japan, Nintendo {{announced}} that they were partnering with Japanese web services provider Hatena to provide the means to share works created with the software. Speaking for Nintendo, Yoshiaki Koizumi stated they chose to work with Hatena because [...] "it takes a special skill set to maintain the User Generated Contents (UGC) site, and we don't have that skill. <b>We</b> <b>rely</b> on Hatena on that part." ...|$|E
2500|$|Beauregard was {{considered}} the Confederate hero of the battle and was promoted that day by C.S. President Davis to full general in the Confederate army. Stonewall Jackson, arguably the most important tactical contributor to the victory, received no special recognition, but would later achieve glory for his 1862 Valley Campaign. Privately, Davis credited Greenhow with ensuring Confederate victory. Jordan sent a telegram to Greenhow: [...] "Our President and our General direct me to thank you. <b>We</b> <b>rely</b> upon you for further information. The Confederacy owes you a debt. (Signed) JORDAN, Adjutant-General." ...|$|E

30|$|This study {{gathered}} two self-report instruments {{following the}} literature on hedonic and eudaemonic happiness. <b>We</b> <b>relied</b> on a measure of positive affect as a proxy to hedonic happiness, as {{it refers to the}} positive emotional experience in the moment. As for eudaemonic happiness, <b>we</b> <b>relied</b> on a measure of purpose in life, one of its core characteristics. The psychometric characteristics were tested for all the self-report measures. Regarding these instruments these were translated into Portuguese by two experienced researchers, fluent in English. The Portuguese version of it was later translated back to English, by another native English speaker into English language to ensure the accuracy of the translation, warranting, therefore the items’ linguistic particularities.|$|R
2500|$|Mavens are [...] "information specialists", or [...] "people <b>we</b> <b>rely</b> upon {{to connect}} us with new information". They {{accumulate}} knowledge, especially about the marketplace, {{and know how}} to share it with others. Gladwell cites Mark Alpert as a prototypical Maven who is [...] "almost pathologically helpful", further adding, [...] "he can't help himself". In this vein, Alpert himself concedes, [...] "A Maven is someone who wants to solve other people's problems, generally by solving his own". According to Gladwell, Mavens start [...] "word-of-mouth epidemics" [...] due to their knowledge, social skills, and ability to communicate. As Gladwell states: [...] "Mavens are really information brokers, sharing and trading what they know".|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after his}} first {{election}} to the Senate, Lieberman was approached by incoming Majority Leader George Mitchell who advised him, [...] "Pick out two or three areas that you’re really interested in and learn them so that your colleagues know what you’re talking about...You’re {{going to have more}} influence even as a freshman than you think because you know there’s hundreds of issues and inevitably <b>we</b> <b>rely</b> on each other.” Recalling the conversation, Lieberman has said, [...] "that was true when I first came in, although you could see partisanship beginning to eat away at that. But {{at the end of my}} 24 years, it was really so partisan that it was hard to make the combinations to get to 60 votes to break a filibuster to get things done." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{subwoofer}} is a woofer driver {{used only}} for the lowest-pitched part of the audio spectrum: typically below 200Hz for consumer systems, below 100Hz for professional live sound, and below 80Hz in THX-approved systems. Because the intended range of frequencies is limited, subwoofer system design is usually simpler in many respects than for conventional loudspeakers, often consisting of a single driver enclosed in a suitable box or enclosure. [...] Since sound in this frequency range can easily bend around corners by diffraction, the speaker aperture {{does not have to}} face the audience, and subwoofers can be mounted {{in the bottom of the}} enclosure, facing the floor. [...] This is eased by the limitations of human hearing at low frequencies; [...] such sounds cannot be located in space, due to their large wavelengths compared to higher frequencies which produce differential effects in the ears due to shadowing by the head, and diffraction around it, both of which <b>we</b> <b>rely</b> upon for localization clues.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{validate}} the proposed representation model <b>we</b> <b>relied</b> upon two hypotheses: metric resolution and variability. The remainder of this article addresses the validity of these hypotheses by proposing a set of parameterizations and evaluation criteria to assess our representation model.|$|R
30|$|Methods: This {{comparative}} {{study focused on}} several criteria: method of preparation and administration of the product, dosimetry, patient exam preparation, image acquisition and quality.

2500|$|Another MP, Hussain al-Falluji, {{demanded that}} Iraqi {{security}} forces immediately cease using the ADE 651. His proposal {{to establish an}} investigative committee and seek to recover {{the money spent on}} the devices was supported by other parliamentarians. Hadi Al-Ameri, the head of the Parliament's Security and Defense Committee, said that he would push for an official investigation to [...] "find out how this piece of equipment was sold to Iraq." [...] If it was determined that ATSC was responsible he planned to [...] "seek compensation via the ministry of foreign affairs." [...] MP Haneen Kado said: [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>rely</b> on these devices {{there is no point in}} having checkpoints. It makes the whole of Baghdad open to terrorist attacks. We are in a dangerous situation and there could be new bombings at any time. We must investigate exactly who bought and sold these detectors and see that they answer in court." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Duke of Portland {{wrote to}} Fitzwilliam on 16 February, {{in a letter}} {{approved}} by the Cabinet, that the Bill would [...] "produce such {{a change in the}} present constitution of the House of Commons as will overturn that, and with it the present ecclesiastical establishment". In his private covering letter of the 18 February to this letter, he spoke of being [...] "too much hurt and grieved" [...] by Fitzwilliam's ultimatum and begged him to be patient. Two days after he sent the Cabinet's demand that they [...] "inform you in the plainest and most direct terms that <b>we</b> <b>rely</b> upon your zeal and influence to take the most effectual means in your power to prevent any further proceeding being had on that Bill until his Majesty's pleasure shall be signified to you with regard to your future conduct respecting it".

30|$|The {{starting}} {{dates for}} subsidised employment {{are available from}} the PES (since they refer to the starting date of a program administrated by the PES), but not the starting dates for non-subsidized employment.

This evidence, so world-wide, so diversified in source, so old, and so new, Mr. Max Muller impugns. But, before meeting his case, let us clear up a personal question.|$|E
60|$|This plan is {{recommended}} as a means, not in exclusion of, but additional to, all others for restoring and preserving the national authority throughout the Union. The subject is presented exclusively in its economical aspect. The plan would, I am confident, secure peace more speedily and maintain it more permanently {{than can be}} done by force alone, while all it would cost, considering amounts and manner of payment and times of payment, would be easier paid than will be the additional cost of the war if <b>we</b> <b>rely</b> solely upon force.
