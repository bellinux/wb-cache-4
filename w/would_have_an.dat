5|$|A skills {{commission}} report released in 2013, backed by Labour MP Barry Sheerman, suggests {{that young people}} were being let down by the education system, with particular criticism aimed towards the lack of information, advice and guidance available to 14-19 year olds. The government were hopeful that the changes <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> effect on preventing the increase in crime levels, as figures reported a substantial percentage of young people leaving school were turning {{to a life of}} crime, with many being unable to find suitable work due to lack of skills and qualifications.|$|E
5|$|Actual {{planning}} for I-359 commenced in 1961, and by 1971, the Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT) announced that federal funding would be sought for its construction. Planning for the corridor continued throughout the 1970s, only to stall briefly due to complications with the required {{environmental impact assessment}} associated with the project. By 1976, it was announced I-359 <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> exit both at 35th Street and 15th Street to improve access to both the University of Alabama and Stillman College.|$|E
50|$|Ipsos MORI {{surveyed}} {{members of}} the Royal Economic Society and the Society of Business Economists for The Observer, with 639 responses.

5|$|Breadth of {{definition}} of a good: The broader the {{definition of a}} good (or service), the lower the elasticity. For example, Company X's fish and chips would tend to have a relatively high elasticity of demand if a significant number of substitutes are available, whereas food in general <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> extremely low elasticity of demand because no substitutes exist.|$|E
5|$|Cagney {{returned}} to the studio and made Hard to Handle in 1933. This {{was followed by a}} steady stream of films, including the highly regarded Footlight Parade, which gave Cagney the chance to return to his song-and-dance roots. The film includes show-stopping scenes with Busby Berkeley-choreographed routines. His next notable film was 1934's Here Comes the Navy, which paired him with Pat O'Brien for the first time. The two <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> enduring friendship.|$|E
5|$|Due to its location, the Church of St Peter {{is often}} {{described}} as a cemetery church. However, scholar Bistra Nikolova considers it improbable that an ordinary village cemetery church <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> inscription by a Bulgarian tsar. In her opinion, {{it is more likely that}} the church was constructed by a noble person related to the court of the Second Bulgarian Empire.|$|E

5|$|Following the Elliot Minor tour, {{the group}} began writing {{material}} for their debut album. In late November and early December, the band went {{on their first}} headlining tour of the UK, with support from Flood of Red. During the latter month, the band wrote further material. All of the songs on the album were written and arranged by themselves. Typically, Helyer or Franceschi <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> idea that the band would then flesh out together. Occasionally, the band would record demos and change sections of them.|$|E
5|$|For the Michael Jackson and Friends {{concerts and}} on, Jackson wore a red shirt {{instead of the}} {{original}} white shirt and tie, but the tie was kept in.

5|$|Furthermore, it {{was found}} that {{families}} failed to seek medical treatment for their daughters because of the stigma associated with negative medical histories.

5|$|Hoshino based the {{character}} on a celebrity whose identity {{she refused to}} reveal. Primarily a clown in his early appearances, she later gave him a human form which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> unspecified impact in the series. Critical reaction to the Millennium Earl has been positive, with critics finding his revival {{of the dead and}} killing of humans appealingly ironic. His enigmatic depth in the sequel, D.Gray-man Hallow, was also praised. A variety of merchandise based on {{the character}} has been released.|$|E
5|$|In November 2016, Fede Álvarez was {{announced}} {{as the new}} director.

In March 2017, it was confirmed that the film <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> entirely new cast and was scheduled to be released on October 5, 2018. In September 2017, Claire Foy was officially cast for the role of Lisbeth Salander in the new film.|$|E
5|$|The Labour Party {{noted that}} the {{allocation}} of credits to emitters on a 'intensity' basis, with no cap on emissions, meant that emitters <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> incentive to continue to emit greenhouse gases.

5|$|The {{practicality}} of {{this approach}} is questionable with modern material science, but cannot yet be ruled out. A 100% reflective statite deployed around the Sun <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> overall density of 0.78 grams per square meter of sail. To illustrate the low mass of the required materials, consider that the total mass of a bubble of such material 1 AU in radius would be about 2.17 kg, which is about the same mass as the asteroid Pallas. Another illustration: Regular printing paper has a density of around 80 g/m2.|$|E
5|$|The {{similarities}} of yttrium to the lanthanides are {{so strong}} that the element has historically been grouped with them as a rare-earth element, and is always found in nature together with them in rare-earth minerals. Chemically, yttrium resembles those elements more closely than its neighbor in the periodic table, scandium, and if physical properties were plotted against atomic number, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> apparent number of 64.5 to 67.5, placing it between the lanthanides gadolinium and erbium.|$|E
5|$|The undiscovered isotope 284Ds {{has been}} {{predicted}} {{to be the}} most stable towards beta decay; however, no known darmstadtium isotope has been observed to undergo beta decay. Theoretical calculation in a quantum tunneling model reproduces the experimental alpha decay half-life data for the known darmstadtium isotopes. It also predicts that the undiscovered isotope 294Ds, which has a magic number of neutrons (184), <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> alpha decay half-life on the order of 311years: exactly the same approach predicts a ~3500-year alpha half-life for the non-magic 293Ds isotope, however.|$|E

5|$|A {{stretch of}} land {{containing}} the later strategic strongholds of Amida (Diyarbakır, Turkey) and Bezabde came under firm Roman military occupation. With these territories, Rome <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> advance station north of Ctesiphon, {{and would be}} able to slow any future advance of Persian forces through the region. Many cities east of the Tigris came under Roman control, including Tigranokert, Saird, Martyropolis, Balalesa, Moxos, Daudia, and Arzan– though under what status is unclear. At the conclusion of the peace, Tiridates regained both his throne and the entirety of his ancestral claim. Rome secured a wide zone of cultural influence, which led to a wide diffusion of Syriac Christianity from a center at Nisibis in later decades, and the eventual Christianization of Armenia.|$|E
5|$|After the 1992–93 season, Bridgman {{was fired}} and {{replaced}} by Senators Vice-President Randy Sexton. In the 1993–94 season, the club added prospects Daigle and Yashin. Yashin <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> outstanding rookie season and become {{a finalist for the}} Calder Memorial Trophy. Yashin led the team in points with 30 goals and 79 points, while Daigle had 51 points. The Senators would make some progress, improving their record to 14 wins and 37 points, but would again finish last in the League. The Senators would select Radek Bonk with their pick, third overall, in the 1994 Draft.|$|E

Dragonair Cargo continued to see steady growth and the airline began a Hong Kong–Shanghai freight route on behalf of DHL in June 2003 and leased an Airbus A300 freighter to start a cargo service to Nanjing in June 2004. A second daily European loop to Frankfurt and London, in addition to Manchester and Amsterdam, followed and by mid-2004 the airline had five Boeing 747 freighters and 26 Airbus passenger aircraft. In a bitter Air Transport Licensing Authority (ATLA) hearings in 2004, Cathay Pacific applied to fly to three mainland cities to which Dragonair filed an objection, saying the move <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> effect on its very survival.|$|E

50|$|Munsell Value {{defines the}} {{lightness}} of a color, {{or how much}} black or white the color contains. The neutral color scale, from black to white with neutral greys in between, all <b>have</b> <b>a</b> hue of 0, which means they do not contain any hue. Instead these colors only change in value. Black <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> value of 0N, with N designating value. White <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> value of 10N, and middle grey <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> value of 5N. A grey in between middle grey and black <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> value of 2.5N. This value scale is based upon visual experiments. The middle grey is visual perceived to have equal amounts of black and white, and so on for other greys.
