The negotiations of Mary's marriage in France caused a new rift within the Hungarian nobility, because the Lackfis, Nicholas Zámbó and Nicholas Szécsi and other high officers, who had been appointed during Louis the Great's reign, continued to support Mary's fiancé, Sigismund, in accordance with Louis the Great's <b>will.</b> <b>The</b> queen mother replaced them with Nicholas Garai's supporters in August 1384. The prelates were also opposed to the French marriage, because the French supported Clement VII whom the Hungarian clergy considered an antipope. Mary's sister, Jadwiga, went to Poland where she was crowned on 16October 1384. Cardinal Demetrius, who had accompanied Jadwiga to Poland, remained absent from the queens' court after his return to Hungary.

5|$|Applying the {{categorical}} imperative, duties arise because {{failure to}} fulfil them would either {{result in a}} contradiction in conception or in a contradiction in the <b>will.</b> <b>The</b> former are classified as perfect duties, the latter as imperfect.

An imperfect duty allows flexibility—beneficence is an imperfect duty {{because we are not}} obliged to be completely beneficent at all times, but may choose the times and places in which we are. Kant believed that perfect duties are more important than imperfect duties: if a conflict between duties arises, the perfect duty must be followed.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{have taken}} differing views of Æthelwulf's <b>will.</b> <b>The</b> editors of Alfred's will, Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge, suggest that Æthelwulf's other {{surviving}} son, Æthelberht, was {{excluded from the}} arrangement because he was provided for separately in the eastern kingdom (the recently conquered south-east England), where he acted as king in 855 and 856; it was probably intended that he should establish a separate dynasty there. The bequest to the three brothers would only have covered part of Æthelwulf's property. The transmission of folkland was governed by customary law, and another portion was reserved for the holder {{of the office of}} king. Keynes and Lapidge argue that Æthelwulf clearly intended that his personal property should be preserved intact, and it seems to have been considered desirable that this should be held by the reigning king, so it is likely that he intended the kingship of western Wessex to be inherited by the survivor of the three brothers. This plan was abandoned when Æthelbald died in 860 and the kingdom was reunited under Æthelberht, and Æthelred's confirmation of the arrangement when he acceded in 865 recognised Alfred as heir apparent.|$|E
40|$|This essay {{examines}} a presupposed {{correlation between}} the way one look upon values and the way one look upon <b>the</b> <b>will</b> of <b>the</b> people in a theoretical democratic context. The more specific purpose is to test the following hypothesis: There is a reversed connection between the way one look upon values and the way one look upon <b>the</b> <b>will</b> of <b>the</b> people in a theoretical democratic context, that is; a strong claim of values give reason to a limited conception of <b>the</b> <b>will</b> of <b>the</b> people and a weak claim of values gives reason for a more unlimited conception of <b>the</b> <b>will</b> of <b>the</b> people. In order {{to test the hypothesis}} I examine three different conceptions of democracy, these are: pluralist democracy, deliberative democracy and constitutional democracy. I analyze the way they look upon values, there view of <b>the</b> <b>will</b> of <b>the</b> people and finally if there is a connection between the way they look upon values and <b>the</b> <b>will</b> of <b>the</b> people. Values should be understood in a metaethical context. In other words it is not values in the “common” meaning, instead its how val-ues in them selves should be understood, and even more relevant, what we mean when we ex-press values. My conclusions are, first and foremost, that there is a correlation between <b>the</b> <b>will</b> of <b>the</b> people and values, according to the formulation of the hypothesis. This leaves, for that specific issue, two alternatives; a weak conception of values with a strong conception of <b>the</b> <b>will</b> of <b>the</b> people, and, a strong conception of values with a weak conception of <b>the</b> <b>will</b> of <b>the</b> people. I also conclude that there are problems with both alternatives. A weak conception of values could result in moral diffi-culties, such as a majority oppresses a minority. And a strong conception of values could result in an excavation of democracy. As for the conceptions of democracy, I conclude that the pluralistic democracy has a relativistic view on values and an (more or less) unlimited conception of <b>the</b> <b>will</b> of <b>the</b> people. The delibera-tive democracy has a similar conception with a few exceptions. The constitutional democracy have a somewhat relativistic conception of values but with objectivistic elements, and hence a limited conception of <b>the</b> <b>will</b> of <b>the</b> people...|$|R
