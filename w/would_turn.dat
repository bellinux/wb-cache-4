5|$|A hairy and fiery star having {{then made}} its {{appearance}} for several days, the mathematicians declared {{that there would}} follow grievous pestilence, dearth and some great calamity. Calixtus, to avert the wrath of God, ordered supplications that if evils were impending for the human race He <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> all upon the Turks, the enemies of the Christian name. He likewise ordered, to move God by continual entreaty, that notice should be given by the bells to call the faithful at midday to aid by their prayers those engaged in battle with the Turk.|$|E
5|$|As Jesus vs. Santa {{became more}} popular, Parker and Stone began talks of {{developing}} the short into a television series. Fox refused {{to pick up the}} series, not wanting to air a show that included the character Mr. Hankey, a talking piece of feces. The two then entered negotiations with both MTV and Comedy Central. Parker preferred the show be produced by Comedy Central, fearing that MTV <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> it into a kids show. When Comedy Central executive Doug Herzog watched the short, he commissioned for it to be developed into a series.|$|E
5|$|Costa {{was born}} in Lagarto, Sergipe, Brazil, to parents José de Jesus and Josileide. His father named him in honour of Argentine footballer Diego Maradona despite the rivalry between the two nations, and he has an elder brother named Jair after Brazilian player Jairzinho. Despite {{regularly}} playing street football, Costa did not believe as a child that he <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> professional, {{in part due to}} the remote location of his hometown. He has since set up a football academy in his hometown, where he pays all the costs. Costa is a fan of Palmeiras.|$|E

50|$|The {{line was}} {{originally}} single track, constructed with 36-pound rails. It would run on Chester Avenue, until 24th Street. It <b>would</b> then, <b>turn</b> east for one block. The line <b>would</b> then <b>turn</b> north again, on K Street. It would continue north and terminate at the Southern Pacific railroad tracks.|$|R
5|$|He {{spoke to}} Harold Howitt {{when he was}} {{thinking}} of leaving the BTC and was informed that Miles Thomas needed an experienced accountant to institute strict financial controls at BOAC. Smallpeice <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> down the role initially, fearing BOAC (also state owned) would be similar to the BTC in terms of culture and manageability. Howitt pressed Smallpeice to reconsider and following a meeting a few days with Miles Thomas and he accepted the position at BOAC, which was tailored to the role he and Miles Thomas desired he have within the company.|$|E
5|$|If built, {{the light}} rail would have as its western {{terminus}} a maintenance facility across Highway 82 from the airport. It {{would include a}} stop at Buttermilk and parallel the highway, using the old Maroon Creek Bridge, until it reached Monarch Street downtown. There it <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> south to its eastern terminus at Rubey Park. If there is not sufficient support or funding for the light rail, it could be built as bus lanes at first.|$|E
5|$|Swannell {{played as}} a forward, {{and in his}} last Test {{specifically}} at number eight. He was an unconventional and hard rugby player, known for his violent play. He <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> up for training in unwashed kit, and wore the same pair of breeches for every game, again unwashed. His poor personal hygiene and overly violent playing style, made him an unpopular character {{in the eyes of}} other players.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} {{attempted to}} prohibit {{the use of}} copper currency in border regions and in seaports, but the Song-issued copper coin became common in the Liao, Western Xia, Japanese, and Southeast Asian economies. The Song government <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> to other types of material for its currency in order to ease the demand on the government mint, including the issuing of iron coinage and paper banknotes. In the year 976, the percentage of issued currency using copper coinage was 65%; after 1135, this had dropped significantly to 54%, a government attempt to debase the copper currency.|$|E
5|$|The {{short and}} unworthy reigns of Radu V’s successors only {{increased}} {{the crisis of}} Wallachia. Starting with Mircea the Shepherd (15451559), the first prince placed on the throne by the sultan, the crown became negotiable, according to the largest tribute offered. Even Michael the Brave who in time <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> against the Ottomans ascended the throne {{with the support of}} some people who had influence with the Sublime Porte, among them Sir Edward Barton, the English ambassador to Istanbul.|$|E
5|$|Writer Troy Kennedy Martin {{was greatly}} {{influenced}} by the political climate of the time, dominated by the Thatcher government, and the aura of secrecy surrounding the nuclear industry – and by {{the implications of the}} Gaia hypothesis of environmentalist James Lovelock; these combined to his crafting a thriller that mingled real world concerns with mythic and mystical elements. Kennedy Martin's original ending was more fantastic than that eventually used in the finished serial: he had proposed that Craven <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> into a tree but this was vetoed by members of the cast and crew.|$|E

5|$|Written by Edward Young, this is {{a horror}} story set in an {{isolated}} house. It would feature a group of university staff, one who was a cripple, trapped in the house during winter. One of the characters <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> {{out to be a}} murderer. The story took its name and theme from the poem Night-Thoughts by Edward Young, namesake of the story's writer. It was later adapted by Young for Big Finish in February 2006. The adaptation featured the Seventh Doctor and Ace, as well as Big Finish-original companion Hex.|$|E
5|$|A 19th-century ethnographic account {{from eastern}} Herzegovina {{describes}} a way through {{which a man}} who was not born as a zduhać could become one. Forty days after he ceased praying to God and washing his face, the man should go to some level ground, before he drew a circle on the ground and sat in its centre. Soon the Devil would come and ask the man whether he was willing to join his army, and what form he wanted to be transformed into. When the man stated the desired form, the Devil <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> him into that, making him a zduhać. In the region of Semberija, northeast Bosnia, а zduhać could pass his supernatural power on to his son.|$|E
5|$|A line {{running along}} Manhattan's West Side, {{stretching}} {{from the edge of}} the city at Yonkers to 14th Street. It would be a two-track line south to Dyckman Street, a three-track line to 162nd Street, and then-on it would be a four-track line. The line would have two southern branches that would diverge at 14th Street. A connection to the BMT Canarsie Line would use a pair of the tracks, while the other pair would go to Atlantic Avenue and Hicks Street in Brooklyn through an East River tunnel. Then it <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> down to Red Hook. There would also be a loop at Battery Park. Another branch would be built; it would consist of two tracks, and would go between 162nd Street and 190th Street via Amsterdam Avenue.|$|E

5|$|A. Newton {{requested}} further specimens, especially males, but in 1875 {{he finally}} published {{a plate of}} the female, lamenting that no male specimens could be found. Tafforet's 1726 account had been rediscovered the previous year, and A. Newton noted that it confirmed his assumption that the male <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> out be much more colourful than the female. Newton's collector, Henry H. Slater, had seen a live Newton's parakeet the year before, but was not carrying a gun at the time. On 14 August 1875, William Vandorous shot a male specimen. It {{may have been the}} same specimen Slater had observed. It was subsequently sent to E. Newton by William J. Caldwell. This is the paratype of the species, numbered UMZC 18/Psi/67/h/2 and housed in the Cambridge Museum.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the book}} by Nationalmuseum, the {{controversy}} concerned Carl Larsson's personal prestige and the ideals that he stood for, but his contemporaries <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> more and more indifferent to these ideals. The events embittered his last years and he declared in his autobiography that the controversy broke him down and that he admitted it with anger. It is clear {{that he began to}} identify himself with the work and it is possible that he also identified himself with the sacrificed king, as he primarily saw conspiracies and bad intentions behind the opposition. This identification was made apparent in his self-portrait, in 1916, where he presented himself as king Domalde, and which he donated to Sundborn parish where he lived.|$|E
5|$|Between 1963 and 1965, {{archaeological sites}} and remains were located {{with the help}} of aerial photographs, and a ground survey was carried out as well to {{determine}} the periods that were present at each site. Between 1965 and 1970, foreign archaeological missions carried out systematic excavations at the sites of Mureybet (United States), Tell Qannas (Belgium), Habuba Kabira, Mumbaqa (Germany), Selenkahiye (Netherlands), and Emar (France). With help from UNESCO, two minarets at Mureybet and Meskene were photogrammetrically measured, and a protective glacis was built around the castle Qal'at Ja'bar. The castle was located on a hilltop that would not be flooded, but the lake <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> it in an island. The castle is now connected to the shore by a causeway.|$|E

5|$|Coyle {{retired from}} playing duties in 1980, but {{continued}} as manager. In 1982, future manager David Jeffrey joined the club following {{a stint in}} the Manchester United youth team and played for Coyle under many of his trophy successes, captaining the side for much of that time. One of Coyle's biggest achievements as manager was leading the club to six consecutive league titles between 1981–82 and 1986–87, equalling the record for the most consecutive titles which was set by Belfast Celtic in 1947–48. 1986 was the year that Noel Bailie began what <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> out to be a 25-year career at the club. Although a defender for most of that time, Bailie began as a left midfielder.|$|E
5|$|External staircases. Most villas and palazzi were {{designed}} for formal entrance by a carriage through an archway in the street façade, leading to a courtyard within. An intricate double staircase would lead from the courtyard to the piano nobile. This would be the palazzo's principal entrance to the first-floor reception rooms; the symmetrical flights of steps <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> inwards and outwards {{as many as four}} times. Owing to the topography of their elevated sites it was often necessary to approach churches by many steps; these steps were often transformed into long straight marble staircases, in themselves decorative architectural features (illustration 19), in the manner of the Spanish Steps in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Guido Forti {{alleged that}} Shannon Racing had not paid him any money within the stipulated six-day {{deadline}} after {{the deal was}} concluded and refuted the claim that it now owned 51% of his team. As the team ran out of money, it was doubtful whether it <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> up at the British GP. In the end, Forti took part, only for the cars to complete a mere handful of laps each in practice and thus failing to set a time quick enough to qualify. This was because it was becoming increasingly in debt to Cosworth and {{was running out of}} engine mileage for its cars, only having enough to make a token effort at participation. The team made it to the next race - the German GP - but both cars remained unassembled in the pit garages throughout the weekend after the engine supply was finally cut off.|$|E
