50|$|In the 20th century, stonemasonry saw {{its most}} radical {{changes in the}} way the work is accomplished. Prior to {{the first half of the}} century, most heavy <b>work</b> was {{executed}} <b>by</b> <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> or human muscle power. With the arrival of the internal combustion engine, many of these hard aspects of the trade have been made simpler and easier. Cranes and forklifts have made moving and laying heavy stones relatively easy for the stonemasons. Motor powered mortar mixers have saved much in time and energy as well. Compressed-air powered tools have made working of stone less time-intensive. Petrol and electric powered abrasive saws can cut through stone much faster and with more precision than chiseling alone. Carbide-tipped chisels can stand up to much more abuse than the steel and iron chisels made by blacksmiths of old.|$|R
5000|$|The wagons {{were among}} the largest ever pulled <b>by</b> <b>draft</b> <b>animals,</b> {{designed}} to carry 10 short tons (9 metric tons) of borax ore at a time.|$|R
50|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, twenty-mule teams, for instance, were teams of {{eighteen}} mules and two horses attached to large wagons that ferried borax out of Death Valley from 1883 to 1889.

50|$|Maritime {{trade was}} driven by the {{development}} of shipping companies with significant financial resources. Canal barges, towed <b>by</b> <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> on an adjacent towpath, contended with the railway up to and past {{the early days of the}} industrial revolution. Flat-bottomed and flexible scow boats also became widely used for transporting small cargoes. Mercantile trade went hand-in-hand with exploration, self-financed by the commercial benefits of exploration.|$|R
50|$|A barge is a {{flat-bottomed}} boat, built {{mainly for}} river and canal transport of heavy goods. Some barges are not self-propelled {{and must be}} towed or pushed by towboats. Canal barges, towed <b>by</b> <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> on an adjacent towpath, contended with the railway in the early Industrial Revolution, but were outcompeted in the carriage of high-value items due to the higher speed, falling costs and route flexibility of railways.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} general types of harrows: disc harrows, tine harrows (including spring-tooth harrows, drag harrows, and spike harrows), chain harrows, and chain-disk harrows. Harrows were {{originally}} drawn <b>by</b> <b>draft</b> <b>animals,</b> such as horses, mules, or oxen, {{or in some}} times and places by manual labourers. In modern practice they are almost always tractor-mounted implements, either trailed after the tractor by a drawbar or mounted on the three-point hitch.|$|R
5000|$|In 1776, {{the wooden}} Bridge Behind the Barracks (...) {{replaced}} the footbridge. It {{was built to}} link St. Peter's Barracks north {{of the river and}} the Poljane residential district south of it. In 1835, it was replaced by a new one. There were actually two bridges, the wider one used <b>by</b> <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> and the narrower one by pedestrians, and {{from the beginning of the}} 20th century, by the Ljubljana tram.|$|R
50|$|The {{basic idea}} of soil {{scratching}} for weed control is ancient and {{was done with}} hoes or mattocks for millennia before cultivators were developed. Cultivators were originally drawn <b>by</b> <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> (such as horses, mules, or oxen) or were pushed or drawn by people. In modern commercial agriculture, the amount of cultivating done for weed control has been greatly reduced via use of herbicides instead. However, herbicides are not always desirable—for example, in organic farming.|$|R
50|$|The west branch drains spruce {{forests of}} the {{southern}} part of the Maine North Woods, and drops 1174 ft to Medway from sources along the Maine-Quebec border. Logging of the west branch began in 1828. Logs were loaded onto sleds towed to the river <b>by</b> <b>draft</b> <b>animals.</b> Log drives would float the logs downstream as far as Bangor, Maine when the snow and ice melted. Sawmill business on the west branch peaked in 1872.|$|R
50|$|Such barges {{need to be}} towed by tugboats or {{pushed by}} towboats. Canal barges, towed <b>by</b> <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> on a {{waterway}} adjacent towpath were of fundamental importance in the early Industrial Revolution, whose major early engineering projects were efforts to build viaducts, aqueducts and especially canals to fuel and feed raw materials to nascent factories in the early industrial takeoff (18th century) and take their goods to ports and cities for distribution.|$|R
50|$|Frans August Larson was {{the first}} Christian & Missionary Alliance missionary to Mongolia. The year was 1893, and Larson was now 23 years old. From the harbor city of Tientsin, he {{traveled}} to Beijing and on to Paotao, a distance of over 700 miles. Larson covered most of this distance on foot, since he was too tall to ride a donkey, and he {{was too much of}} an animal lover to accept a ride in a wagon drawn <b>by</b> <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> that were relentlessly whipped by the driver.|$|R
50|$|Bent entrances of such {{complexity}} as at Crac {{are less}} common in European castles, where even in strongly defended keep-gatehouses the entrance passage {{tends to be}} straight. See for example the long gate passage at Harlech Castle, which uses multiple doors and murder-holes, but no turns. Cathcart King {{has argued that the}} bent entrance was less widespread in Europe than in the Crusader states because transport in Europe tended to be based on carts pulled <b>by</b> <b>draft</b> <b>animals,</b> which makes negotiating a twisting passage impractical, whereas camels, as used in the East, would have less difficulty.|$|R
5000|$|Spruce {{forests of}} the Maine North Woods were a source of {{pulpwood}} through the 20th century. Trees were bucked into 4 ft lengths and loaded onto sleds towed <b>by</b> <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> or log haulers to the nearest river or lake. Log drives would float the pulpwood logs to a downstream paper mill when the snow and ice melted. [...] Pulpwood growing in the upper Saint John River drainage was destined for Great Northern Paper Company's Millinocket mill on the West Branch Penobscot River. The problem was getting the pulpwood out of the north-flowing Saint John River into the east-flowing Penobscot River.|$|R
50|$|Early {{roads were}} often rolled rather than plowed to compact {{accumulated}} snow into a surface suitable for sleighs drawn <b>by</b> <b>draft</b> <b>animals.</b> Rail transportation brought {{the requirement for}} snow removal by plows. In the 1840s railway companies began using bucker plows to remove snow from railways. The first incarnation of the wedge plow was the Bucker Plow which were made of wood. Because {{of the amount of}} capital invested in railroads, the railways were required to be functional year-round. Because of this, snow needed to be cleared from the railways in an efficient manner. The Wedge Plow was patented by Charles Lowbaert to keep railways functional during the winter.|$|R
50|$|In its {{simplest}} form {{it resembles}} a hoe, {{consisting of a}} draft-pole (either composite or a single piece) pierced with a nearly vertical, wooden, spiked head (or stock) which is dragged through the soil <b>by</b> <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> and very rarely by people. The ard-head is at one end a stilt (handle) for steering and at the other a share (cutting blade) which gouges the surface ground. More sophisticated models have a composite pole, where the section attached to the head is called the draft-beam, and the share may be made of stone or iron. Some have a cross-bar for handles or two separate stilts for handles (two-handled ard). The share comes in two basic forms: a socket share slipped over {{the nose of the}} ard-head; and the tang share fitted into a groove where it is held with a clamp on the wooden head. Additionally, a slender protruding chisel (foreshare) can be fitted {{over the top of the}} mainshare.|$|R
50|$|The Baker Branch drains {{a portion}} of the Maine North Woods {{utilized}} for 20th century pulpwood production. Spruce and Balsam Fir trees were bucked into 4-foot (1.2-meter) lengths beginning in 1917 and loaded onto sleds towed <b>by</b> <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> or log haulers to the nearest river or lake. Log drives would float the pulpwood logs to a downstream paper mill when the snow and ice melted. A problem arose because pulpwood growing around the Saint John Ponds was destined for Great Northern Paper Company's Millinocket mill on the West Branch Penobscot River. The Seboomook Lake and Saint John Railroad was built in 1921 to carry pulpwood southerly from Fifth Saint John Pond to Seboomook Lake. The railroad followed the east bank of the Baker Branch between the 4th and 5th Saint John Ponds. The railroad was dismantled and converted to a truck road in the 1950s after the canal was constructed to convey floating pulpwood from Fifth Saint John Pond to the North Branch Penobscot River.|$|R
5000|$|The {{construction}} of the railway along the Angara from Irkutsk to Cape Baranchik (Port Baikal) on Lake Baikal {{was carried out in}} 1896-1900, at a total cost of 3.47 million rubles. In the meantime, East of the lake the railway from Sretensk was completed up to Mysovaya on the east shore of Lake Baikal. With the purpose of establishing a through railway connection, before the Circum-Baikal was finished, it was decided to link the shores of the lake with a train ferry. Trains were carried on the special ice breaker-ferry [...] "Baikal" [...] which had three parallel tracks on its train deck. Another, smaller icebreaker-ferry, the [...] "Angara", was also built which carried passengers and goods, but not trains. In the cold winter of 1903/04 when the icebreakers were not strong enough to break the ice, a railway line was laid on the ice, and railway wagons were pulled <b>by</b> <b>draft</b> <b>animals.</b>|$|R

50|$|Some {{of these}} ancient stone rutways were very ambitious. Around 600 BC the {{citizens}} of ancient Corinth constructed the Diolkos, which some consider the world's first railway. The Diolkos was a hard poros limestone road with grooved tracks (wheel-ruts), along which large wooden flatbed cars carrying entire ships and their cargo were pulled <b>by</b> slaves or <b>draft</b> <b>animals.</b> The grooves were at 1.67 m centres.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{faster than}} carts pulled <b>by</b> <b>draft</b> <b>animals,</b> and cut {{transport}} costs by about 95%. The canal gave New York City's port an incomparable advantage over all other U.S. port cities, and {{ushered in the}} state's 19th century political and cultural ascendancy. [...] The canal fostered a population surge in western New York and opened regions farther west to settlement. It was enlarged between 1834 and 1862. The canal's peak year was 1855, when 33,000 commercial shipments took place. In 1918, {{the western part of}} the canal was enlarged to become part of the New York State Barge Canal, which ran parallel to the eastern half of the Erie Canal, and extended to the Hudson River. In 2000, the United States Congress designated the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor to recognize the national significance of the canal system as the most successful and influential human-built waterway and one of the most important works of civil engineering and construction in North America. Mainly used by recreational watercraft since the retirement of the last large commercial ship, the Day Peckinpaugh in 1994, the canal saw a recovery in commercial traffic in 2008.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, the Colorado Central Railroad {{recognized}} that Berthoud's {{location on the}} river bottom caused their steam-powered locomotives to labor excessively to ascend the grade out of the valley. At their urging, {{during the winter of}} 1883-84, the buildings of the town were loaded on skids and pulled <b>by</b> teams of <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> to the town's present-day location on the bluff one mile (1.6 km) north of the river.|$|R
500|$|Maple {{sugaring}} parties typically {{began to}} operate {{at the start of}} the spring thaw in regions of woodland with sufficiently large numbers of maples. Syrup makers first bored holes in the trunks, usually more than one hole per large tree; they then inserted wooden spouts into the holes and hung a wooden bucket from the protruding end of each spout to collect the sap. The buckets were commonly made by cutting cylindrical segments from a large tree trunk and then hollowing out each segment's core from one end of the cylinder, creating a seamless, watertight container. Sap filled the buckets, and was then either transferred to larger holding vessels (barrels, large pots, or hollowed-out wooden logs), often mounted on sledges or wagons pulled <b>by</b> <b>draft</b> <b>animals,</b> or carried in buckets or other convenient containers. The sap-collection buckets were returned to the spouts mounted on the trees, and the process was repeated for as long as the flow of sap remained [...] "sweet". The specific weather conditions of the thaw period were, and still are, critical in determining the length of the sugaring season. As the weather continues to warm, a maple tree's normal early spring biological process eventually alters the taste of the sap, making it unpalatable, perhaps due to an increase in amino acids.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1316, it {{continued}} to rain on a European population deprived of energy and reserves to sustain itself. All segments of society from nobles to peasants were affected but especially the peasants, who represented 95% {{of the population and}} who had no reserve food supplies. To provide some measure of relief, the future was mortgaged <b>by</b> slaughtering the <b>draft</b> <b>animals,</b> eating the seed grain, abandoning children to fend for themselves (see [...] "Hansel and Gretel") and, among old people, voluntarily refusing food for the younger generation to survive. The chroniclers of the time noted many incidents of cannibalism.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the large}} stock and high {{production}} rate of tractors, most farm tasks {{in the mid-1980s}} were performed manually. Rice continued to be transplanted by hand, as local engineers had yet to develop and produce rice transplanters in substantial quantities. Only 36 {{percent of the land}} was plowed by machines, only 8 percent sown by machines, and only 3 percent of the crop area was harvested <b>by</b> machines. <b>Draft</b> <b>animals</b> continued to be important sources of power, and the number of animals increased sharply in the post-Mao period. Success in mechanization enabled surplus rural laborers to leave the fields to find jobs in rural industry and commerce. In the 1980s most observers believed that China would continue for some time to use mechanization to solve labor shortages at times of peak labor demand and to concentrate mechanization in areas of large-scale farming, as in the North China Plain and the northeast.|$|R
5000|$|... "Until {{almost the}} twentieth century, one simple tool {{constituted}} the primary earthmoving machine: the hand shovel - moved with animal and human powered, sleds, barges, and wagons. This tool {{was the principal}} method by which material was either sidecast or elevated to load a conveyance, usually a wheelbarrow, or a cart or wagon drawn <b>by</b> a <b>draft</b> <b>animal.</b> In antiquity, an equivalent of the hand shovel or hoe and head basket—and masses of men—were used to move earth to build civil works. Builders have long used the inclined plane, levers, and pulleys to place solid building materials, but these labor-saving devices did not lend themselves to earthmoving, which required digging, raising, moving, and placing loose materials. The two elements required for mechanized earthmoving, then as now, were an independent power source and off-road mobility, neither {{of which could be}} provided by the technology of that time." ...|$|R

50|$|At the time, {{all of the}} Army's {{artillery}} and ammunition supplies were transported <b>by</b> <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> (usually, horses). It was becoming evident to many army commanders, both in the United States and abroad, that draft animals—the sole source of transport away from railroad tracks—were highly vulnerable to modern artillery fire at ranges under 1,500 yards, especially when contained in slow-moving trains of horse-drawn carriages and heavy wagons. The inability of army ground forces to bring gunnery and ammunition trains closer than 1,500 yards to an opponent with modern artillery support effectively prevented the short-ranged American black powder cannon of the day from providing any effective counterbattery fire to advancing infantry. In 1897, after considering the issue, Lt. Parker submitted a paper to the Army General Staff in which he advocated the use of highly mobile machine gun detachments. These machine gun detachments would be equipped with portable machine guns capable of being dismantled and transported to the front, together with sufficient supplies of ammunition and spare parts carried in highly mobile carriages and wagons. Parker visualized the detachments as independent from the slow-moving {{artillery and}} ammunition trains, constantly redeploying to avoid being targeted by enemy artillery, while using terrain masking to provide cover {{for the men and}} their transport animals. As self-contained, mobile units, the machine gun detachments could be used by a commander to provide effective covering fire for the artillery trains until they could get within effective range of the enemy lines. Unfortunately, Parker's treatise was ignored by the Army, though he continued to advocate the use of the machine gun in an offensive role.|$|R
50|$|Early graders {{were drawn}} <b>by</b> people and <b>draft</b> <b>animals.</b> The era of {{motorization}} by traction engines, steam tractors, motor trucks, and tractors saw such towed graders grow {{in size and}} productivity. The first self-propelled grader was made in 1920 by the Russell Grader Manufacturing Company, which called it the Russell Motor Hi-Way Patrol. These early graders were created by adding the grader blade as an attachment to a generalist tractor unit. After purchasing the company in 1928, Caterpillar went on to truly integrate the tractor and grader into one design—at the same time replacing crawler tracks with wheels to yield the first rubber-tire self-propelled grader, the Caterpillar Auto Patrol, released in 1931.|$|R

50|$|Oliver began {{experimenting with}} {{improved}} field plow. Farm plows {{of the time}} were pulled <b>by</b> a <b>draft</b> <b>animal</b> as the farmer walked behind. There were many common problems with the plows: muddy ground could cause soil to become stuck on the upper edges of plow requiring the farmer to stop and clean the plow before continuing. When large stones were hit a certain speed, they could cause the plows to break or dent them enough to make them unusable. Oliver's designs sought to resolve both of these issues. He created a molded top edge for the plows allowing it to more easily shed mud away and preventing it from lodging in harness. He also developed a method of casting the plows in a sand mold which rapidly cooled the outer surface of the metal, causing it to be more significantly hardened, while allowing the center to cool slowly, preventing the plow from becoming brittle. The resulting plow was significantly stronger, retained its cutting edge much longer, and required less cleaning during plowing.|$|R
500|$|On Han tomb brick reliefs of Sichuan province, {{scenes of}} {{borehole}} drilling for mining projects are shown. They show towering derricks lifting liquid brine through bamboo pipes {{to the surface}} so that the brine could be distilled in evaporation pans over the heat of furnaces and produce salt. The furnaces were heated by natural gas brought by bamboo pipes, yet gas brought up from [...] below the surface could cause an explosion {{if it was not}} properly mixed with oxygen first, so the Han-era Chinese built underground carburetor chambers and siphoned some of the gas off with exhaust pipes. The drill bit for digging boreholes was operated by a team of men jumping on and off a beam while the boring tool was rotated <b>by</b> a <b>draft</b> <b>animal,</b> usually oxen or water buffaloes. Han boreholes dug for collecting brine could reach hundreds of meters (feet) beneath the Earth's surface.

In 1831, the Chesterfield Railroad began hauling coal from the mines in Midlothian to docks at Manchester (near Richmond), powered <b>by</b> gravity and <b>draft</b> <b>animals.</b> The first railroad in Virginia to be powered by locomotives was the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad, chartered in 1834, with the intent to connect with steamboat lines at Aquia Landing running to Washington, D.C.. Soon after, others (with equally descriptive names) followed: the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad and Louisa Railroad in 1836, the Richmond and Danville Railroad in 1847, the Orange and Alexandria Railroad in 1848, and the Richmond and York River Railroad. In 1849, the Virginia Board of Public Works established the Blue Ridge Railroad. Under Engineer Claudius Crozet, the railroad successfully crossed the Blue Ridge Mountains via the Blue Ridge Tunnel at Afton Mountain.|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} soil {{management}} practices {{was conducted in}} the northern Guinea savanna of Nigeria. Fifteen villages {{were randomly selected from}} a geographical grid covering an area of 100 × 200 km located in the benchmark area of the Ecoregional Program for the Humid and Sub-humid Tropics of Sub-Saharan Africa. In each village the chief and several farmers were interviewed to assess their soil management methods and attitude towards the need to conserve soil. A total of 181 farmers were interviewed in late 1996. The most common crop rotation systems were food legumes with non-legume crops (40 %), followed by monocropping (28 %). Fifty-three per cent of the farmers who included food legumes in their rotations did so for soil fertility considerations, while 49 % of the farmers who practised monocropping did so to maximise their output. These practices indicate that farmers were well {{aware of the importance of}} legumes for maintaining soil fertility. Only 2 % of the farmers practised mulching with crop residue. The most common use of crop residue was for fodder, the remainder largely being used as building material or else burnt. As a consequence, soil surfaces were generally bare at the onset of the rainy season and hence prone to soil erosion. Ridging was the most important land preparation technique (88 %), with farmers perceiving benefit in terms of improved crop emergence (56 %) and water conservation (11 %). Other benefits included weed control. Ridging was generally practised along contours, with most farmers citing soil conservation benefits, e. g. water conservation, and erosion control as the reasons for using contour ridging. Those farmers who purposely ridged up and down the slope did so for drainage purposes. All farmers used the same method to build ridges—the ridge from the previous year was cut in the middle and the two halves of neighbouring ridges were combined to form a new ridge in the furrow from the previous year. According to the farmers, this method controlled weeds and improved emergence. None of the farmers practised rebuilding old ridges, similar to permanent ridges. Such a practice might be acceptable to farmers in that it may be less labour intensive to rebuild partially collapsed ridges compared to reridging completely. Soil physical benefits from semi-permanent ridging would include increased soil structural stability, reduced soil compaction and increased root proliferation into the subsoil. Negative side effects might include reduced crop emergence and increased weed infestation. The most commonly used tools for soil preparation were hand hoes (80 %), followed <b>by</b> <b>draft</b> <b>animals</b> (16 %) and tractors (3 %) ...|$|R
