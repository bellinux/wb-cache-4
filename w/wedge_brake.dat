40|$|Abstract: The {{electronic}} <b>wedge</b> <b>brake</b> {{is one of}} the brake-by-wire {{systems with}} a self-energizing effect. The electronic <b>wedge</b> <b>brake</b> has faster response than the conventional hydraulic brake and requires only about one-tenth the power to operate. However, the electronic <b>wedge</b> <b>brake</b> cannot be implemented unless the self-energizing effect is reliably controlled. The self-energizing mechanisms may result in unintentional lock up and are very sensitive to environment and parametric variations of the friction coefficient. In this study, the electronic <b>wedge</b> <b>brake</b> is modeled into dynamic equations, and a sliding mode controller is designed based on the model. The performance of the proposed controller is verified in simulations...|$|E

The experimental results using <b>wedge</b> <b>brake</b> dynamometerare integrated with Taguchi method to find out the contributions of different types of geometric parameters for effective increasing of the <b>wedge</b> <b>brake</b> performance. From Taguchi method results, the effective geometric parameters to improve the performance of wedgedisc brake are obtained. It can be concluded that the most significant geometric parameters on wedge disc brake performance could be attainedusing combination of the friction material thickness and friction material length...|$|E

50|$|The {{three types}} of {{foundation}} brake systems are “S” cam brakes, disc <b>brakes</b> and <b>wedge</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{driven axles}} for the {{container}} handling equipment are with planetary reduction. The single non-steering axle capacity is 30-32 tonnes; the tandem applications are rated to 26-41 tonnes. The driven steering axles are with 12-18 tonnes capacity and the non-driven option is only available with 10 tonnes capacity. S-cam and disc brakes are applied on both steering and non-steering axles, the heavier steering driven option being fitted with <b>wedge</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|For {{military}} applications {{the selection}} includes both conventional rigid axles {{as well as}} independent suspension systems, all of them being driven with planetary reduction. Both the steering and non-steering rigid axles are with 10-14 tonnes capacities and the tandem applications with double capacity, 20-28 tonnes. The brakes used on rigid axles are predominantly S-cam type; the heavier steering axles are equipped with <b>wedge</b> <b>brakes.</b> The independent suspension systems are for 6×6, 8×8 and 10×10 layouts with 6 to 8 tonnes capacity per axle. The brakes are either disc or wedge type.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the potential application of an electronic <b>wedge</b> <b>brake</b> for vehicle brake system using human-in-the-loop simulation. Simulation was made in MATLAB Simulink software which interfaces an imaginary vehicle with a real time input from a human, such as throttle and brake input. The imaginary vehicle model that is used is a vehicle dynamic model that has been validated experimentally using an instrumented experimental vehicle. A validated electronic <b>wedge</b> <b>brake</b> actuator model was then used as the brake actuator model where a suitable control strategy, namely proportional-integral-derivative and proportional-integral controllers, was utilised as the force and gapping control respectively. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed actuator in a vehicle, the simulation results are compared with the results of human-in-the-loop simulation of a vehicle using a conventional hydraulic brake and the response of the experimental vehicle using the same dynamic test, namely the sudden braking test. The simulation results show that the proposed simulation method and actuator with appropriate controller strategy have similar behaviour to a hydraulic brake in terms of its capability to produce the desired braking force to reduce the speed and halt the vehicle. The outcomes from this study can be considered in design optimisation and implementation in a real vehicle...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the performance characteristic of an electronic <b>wedge</b> <b>brake</b> (EWB) mechanism for a vehicle braking system. Based on a Gaussian cumulative distribution method, a non-parametric model, using Bell-Shaped curve method {{has been proposed}} in this study to characterize the behavior of an actual EWB mechanism. Therefore, a brake test rig has been developed to investigate {{the performance of the}} Bell-Shaped curve model. For the purpose of validation of EWB, an electronic control unit (ECU) which consists of microcontroller unit (MCU), H-Bridge driver and opto-coupler is designed to control the EWB’s pinion according to the given rotational input during the experiment. The response measured throughout the experiment is the gapping displacement of the brake piston, clamping force and also brake torque of the EWB mechanism. The responses of the actual EWB mechanism obtained from the experiment are compared with the proposed Bell-Shaped curve. The result of the study shows that the response of the Bell-Shaped curve model closely follows the response of a real EWB actuator in term of clamping force and brake torque with percentage of errors less than 10 %...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] The aim of {{this study}} is to find the optimal {{geometric}} parameters of the <b>wedge</b> disc <b>brake</b> performance using experimental and statistical studies. A standard response surface methodology called central composite design is applied to study four geometric parameters each with three levels. A total of thirty experimental tests are run using the brake dynamometer to evaluate the main and interaction effect of these variables namely; number of rotor holes, number of friction material slots, friction material length and friction material thickness. The variability in dependent variables is explained by coefficient of determination. The model equation is used to predict the optimum value and subsequently to clarify the interaction between the parameters within the specified range. The experimental results indicate that the proposed mathematical model successfully describes the performance of adaptive <b>wedge</b> <b>brakes</b> within the limits of the geometric parameters that are being investigated.

40|$|In this work, {{laboratory}} tests {{have been carried}} out to investigate the influence of the presence of water and oil film, as well as the existence of wet dust between the disc and brake pads on the performance characteristics of conventional and <b>wedge</b> disc <b>brakes</b> are examined. The number of brake application and its influence on friction at dry and wet conditions are also investigated. The results indicated that the presence of a water layer between brake pads and disc led to increased friction coefficient and therefore increased the brake shoe factor. The presence of oil film between the friction surfaces lead to obvious reduction in the coefficient of friction. The influence of the presence of wet dust between the friction surfaces has a negligible influence on both conventional and <b>wedge</b> disc <b>brakes.</b> KEYWORDS...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} {{a case study of}} Box-Behnken design {{application}} for development and evaluation a new empirical model to predict the performance of <b>wedge</b> disc <b>brake.</b> Box-Behnken design is used to study the applied pressure, rotational speed, wedge inclination angle and quantity of water spraying. A total of 27 experimental tests are conducted using brake dynamometer to estimate the main and interaction effect of these parameters. The results of analysis of variance for the braking forces from the input parameters are obtained to evaluate the goodness of the developed empirical model through F- and P-values. It is found that a strong correlation between the empirical regression model and the actual results. Moreover, in order to confirm the validity of the empirical model, additional 16 experimental tests are carried out using Taguchi method. The results showed a good agreement between the predicted empirical model and experimental results. This indicates that the developed empirical model based on operating parameters can be used successfully to predict the <b>wedge</b> disc <b>brake</b> performance. KEYWORDS...|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1939, Drew {{traveled}} to Tuskegee, Alabama {{to attend the}} annual free clinic at the John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital. For the 1950 Tuskegee clinic, Drew drove along with three other black physicians. Drew was driving around 8 a.m. on April 1. Still fatigued from spending the night before in the operating theater, he {{lost control of the}} vehicle. After careening into a field, the car somersaulted three times. The three other physicians suffered minor injuries. Drew was trapped with serious wounds; his foot had become <b>wedged</b> beneath the <b>brake</b> pedal. When reached by emergency technicians, he was in shock and barely alive due to severe leg injuries.|$|R
