Very little <b>was</b> <b>accomplished</b> in these two trips to England.|$|E
5|$|Buckles did {{not meet}} the {{criteria}} for burial at Arlington National Cemetery as he had never been in combat, but friends and family secured special permission from the federal government in 2008.

5|$|During Rædwald's youth, the {{establishment}} of other ruling houses <b>was</b> <b>accomplished.</b> Sometime before 588, Æthelberht of Kent married Bercta, the Christian daughter of the Frankish ruler Charibert. As early as 568, Ceawlin of Wessex, the most powerful ruler south of the River Humber, repulsed Æthelberht. According to later sources, Mercia was founded by Creoda in 585, although a paucity of sources {{makes it difficult to}} know how the Mercian royal line became established.|$|E
5|$|During the mid-1930s, Highway28 was {{extended}} {{as far north}} as Apsley. This <b>was</b> <b>accomplished</b> by assuming existing Peterborough County roads along the Otonabee River as far as Burleigh Falls, via Lakefield. North of there, the department assumed the Burleigh Falls Road. Highway28 {{was extended}} from Peterborough to Burleigh Falls on April4, 1934.|$|E
5|$|In {{one shot}} Guinness appears as seven of his {{characters}} at {{once in a}} single frame. This <b>was</b> <b>accomplished</b> by masking the lens.

5|$|Kennedy's goal <b>was</b> <b>accomplished</b> on the Apollo 11 mission when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed their Lunar Module (LM) on July 20, 1969, {{and walked}} on the lunar surface, while Michael Collins {{remained}} in lunar orbit in the Command/Service Module (CSM), and all three landed safely on Earth on July 24. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon, the last in December 1972. In these six spaceflights, twelve men {{walked on the}} Moon.|$|E
5|$|Robert E. Lee's United States {{citizenship}} was posthumously {{restored in}} 1975. Davis had been specifically excluded from earlier resolutions restoring rights to other Confederate officials, and a movement arose to restore Davis's citizenship as well. This <b>was</b> <b>accomplished</b> {{with the passing}} of Senate Joint Resolution 16 on October 17, 1978. In signing the law, President Jimmy Carter referred to this as the last act of reconciliation in the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The Comet's thin metal {{skin was}} {{composed}} of advanced new alloys and was both riveted and chemically bonded, which saved weight and reduced the risk of fatigue cracks spreading from the rivets. The chemical bonding process <b>was</b> <b>accomplished</b> using a new adhesive, Redux, which was liberally used {{in the construction of}} the wings and the fuselage of the Comet; it also had the advantage of simplifying the manufacturing process.|$|E

50|$|Absent-mindedness can {{be avoided}} or fixed in several ways.

5|$|The Fat Man and Pumpkin bombs (non-nuclear {{bombs that}} resembled and handled like Fat Man) weighed over , so weight was a concern, {{even with the}} more {{powerful}} engines. Weight reduction <b>was</b> <b>accomplished</b> by removal of all gun turrets and armor plating. This work {{was done by the}} 509th Composite Group for the early Silverplate aircraft, but later models were delivered without them. These B-29s represented a significant increase in performance over the standard variants.|$|E
5|$|The division's {{mission was}} to create a secure and stable {{environment}} so the government of Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide could be reestablished and democratic elections held. After this <b>was</b> <b>accomplished,</b> the 10th Mountain Division handed over control of the MNF-Haiti to the 25th Infantry Division on 15 January 1995. The Division redeployed the last of its soldiers who served in Haiti by 31 January 1995.|$|E

In March 2008, TriMet added {{additional}} capacity during the morning and evening commuting period.

5|$|Zinc was {{distinctly}} {{recognized as}} a metal under the designation of Yasada or Jasada in the medical Lexicon ascribed to the Hindu king Madanapala (of Taka dynasty) and written about the year 1374.

In 1984, von Weizsäcker was elected as President of the Federal Republic of Germany.

5|$|After Celestine's death Theobald {{returned}} to England, stopping at St Denis Abbey in Paris to help Suger, the abbot, consecrate the newly rebuilt abbey church and its altars. Theobald {{was the only}} bishop present at the ceremony whose diocese was not in France. Meanwhile, Henry of Blois had arrived in Rome and begun negotiations with the new pope, Lucius II, over the elevation of the bishopric of Winchester to an archbishopric. It appears that Lucius appointed a legate, Cardinal Icmar, the Bishop of Tusculum, to travel to England and oversee the project, but Lucius died before anything <b>was</b> <b>accomplished.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{his service}} in the House, Brown took a break from politics, but re-entered the {{political}} arena {{as a candidate for}} governor of Kentucky in 1891. He secured the Democratic nomination in a four-way primary election, then convincingly won the general election over his Republican challenger, Andrew T. Wood. Brown's administration, and the state Democratic Party, were split between gold standard supporters (including Brown) and supporters of the free coinage of silver. Brown's was also the first administration to operate under the Kentucky Constitution of 1891, and most of the legislature's time was spent adapting the state's code of laws to the new constitution. Consequently, little of significance <b>was</b> <b>accomplished</b> during Brown's term.|$|E
5|$|After {{the branch}} north of Fort Totten opened, the Green Line Commuter Shortcut {{began as a}} six-month {{experiment}} on January 27, 1997, allowing passengers {{to get on a}} train on the Green Line segment during rush hours and travel as far as Farragut North on the Red Line without having to switch trains at Fort Totten; a transfer was needed during off-peak hours. This <b>was</b> <b>accomplished</b> by utilizing a single-track spur (B & E connection) between the Green and Red Lines near (and bypassing) Fort Totten station. This shortcut was so well-received that it was continued until September 17, 1999, when the mid-city portion of the Green Line was completed.|$|E

5000|$|If {{we have a}} {{goal that}} is {{currently}} unsatisfied, {{it will be more}} prominent in our minds than a goal that has already <b>been</b> <b>accomplished.</b> Thus, if a protagonist has a goal that has not yet <b>been</b> <b>accomplished,</b> that goal should be more accessible to those who comprehend than a goal that <b>was</b> just <b>accomplished</b> by the protagonist. In line with this prediction, goals yet to <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> by the protagonist were recognized more quickly than goals that <b>were</b> just <b>accomplished.</b> We <b>are</b> often able to predict people’s future actions by inferring their goals. For example, when we see a man walking over to a chair, we assume that he wants to sit, especially when he has been standing for a long time. Thus, we might generate the inference, “He is going to sit." ...|$|R
