The Court ruled that because the {{statutory}} text of the IDEA did not explicitly state that expert <b>witness</b> <b>fees</b> were covered, parents could not recover them. The Court reasoned that because the IDEA was enacted under the Spending Clause of the Constitution, Article I, Section 8, the law must “unambiguously” give notice in its statutory text that parents could recover fees. This meant Congress had to declare {{in the body of}} the statute that parents could recover expert <b>witness</b> <b>fees.</b> [...] The IDEA Fairness Restoration Act will amend the statutory text of the IDEA to permit recovery of expert <b>witness</b> <b>fees.</b> Until Congress does, parents must pay their own expert witness fee expenses, even when they prevail.|$|E

50|$|Held: Expert witness {{attendance}} fees {{that are available}} in cases brought under this Court’s original jurisdiction shall {{be the same as}} the expert witness {{attendance fees}} that would be available in a district court under §1821(b). Kansas contends that Congress has never attempted to regulate a prevailing party’s recovery of expert <b>witness</b> <b>fees</b> in a case brought under this Court’s original jurisdiction, that Article III of the Constitution would not permit Congress to impose such a restriction, and thus, that the holding in Crawford Fitting Co. v. J. T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U. S. 437 - that district courts must adhere to §1821(b)’s witness attendance fee limitations—is not relevant here. Assuming that Kansas’ interpretation is correct and that this Court has discretion to determine the fees that are recoverable in original actions, it is nevertheless appropriate to follow §1821(b). Congress’ decision not to permit a prevailing party in the lower courts to recover its actual witness fee expenses departs only slightly from the “American Rule,” under which parties generally bear their own expenses. There is no good reason why the rule for recovering expert <b>witness</b> <b>fees</b> should differ markedly depending on whether a case is originally brought in district court or this Court. District-court cases may be no less complex than those brought originally in this Court. And while the parties in original cases may incur substantial expert costs, as happened here, the same is frequently true in lower court litigation. Thus, assuming that the matter is left entirely to this Court’s discretion, the best approach is to have a uniform rule that applies in all federal cases. Pp. 3-5.|$|E

40|$|Executive Summary I. Survey The Task Force {{conducted}} a wide-ranging survey {{of more than}} 9, 000 licensed Iowa attorneys and judges to obtain their input on a variety of civil justice system topics. The survey results helped inform the Task Force of problem areas in Iowa’s civil justice system. II. Two-Tier Justice System The Task Force recommends a pilot program based on a two-tier civil justice system. A two-tier system would streamline litigation processes—including rules of evidence and discovery disclosures—and reduce litigation costs of certain cases falling below a threshold dollar value. III. One Judge/One Case and Date Certain for Trial Some jurisdictions in Iowa have adopted one judge/one case and date certain for trial in certain cases. The assignment of one judge to each case {{for the life of the}} matter and the establishment of dates certain for civil trials could enhance Iowans’ access to the courts, improve judicial management, promote consistency and adherence to deadlines, and reduce discovery excesses. IV. Discovery Processes Reforms addressing inefficient discovery processes will reduce delays in and costs of litigation. Such measures include adopting an aspirational purpose for discovery rules to “secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action,” holding discovery proportional to the size and nature of the case, requiring initial disclosures, limiting the number of expert witnesses, and enforcing existing rules. V. Expert <b>Witness</b> <b>Fees</b> The Task Force acknowledges the probable need to revisit the statutory additional daily compensation limit for expert <b>witness</b> <b>fees.</b> Leaving the compensation level to the discretion of the trial court is one potential solution. VI. Jurors Additions to the standard juror questionnaire would provide a better understanding of the potential jurors’ backgrounds and suitability for jury service. The Task Force encourages adoption of more modern juror educational materials and video. Rehabilitation of prospective jurors who express an unwillingness or inability to be fair should include a presumption of dismissal. VII. Video and Teleconferencing Options When court resources are constrained both by limited numbers of personnel and budget cuts, it is logical to look to video and teleconferencing technology to streamline the court process and reduce costs. The judicial branch should embrace technological developments in ways that will not compromise the fairness, dignity, solemnity, and decorum of judicial proceedings. VIII. Court-Annexed Alternative Dispute Resolution(ADR) Litigants and practitioners in Iowa are generally satisfied with the current use of private, voluntary ADR for civil cases. There is concern, however, that maintaining the status quo may have steep future costs. Court-annexed ADR is an important aspect of any justice system reform effort, and the Task Force perceives benefits and detriments to reforming this aspect of the Iowa civil justice system. IX. Relaxed Requirement of Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law A rule authorizing parties to waive findings of fact and conclusions of law could expedite resolution of nonjury civil cases. X. Business (Specialty) Courts Specialty business courts have achieved widespread support across the country. In addition, specialty courts provide excellent vehicles for implementing or piloting other court innovations that may be useful in a broader court system context. A business specialty court should be and could be piloted in Iowa within the existing court system framework of the Iowa Judicial Branch. Appendix included as a separate document, is 176 pages...|$|E
40|$|This report {{represents}} a step towards meeting {{the goal of}} the Aarhus Convention Access to Justice Task Force to develop a set of good practices and analyses on three priority issues: · The loser pays principle Article 9 (4) of the Aarhus Convention requires that procedures for obtaining access to justice must not be prohibitively expensive. In some legal systems, the loser of an administrative or judicial action must pay all, or a portion of, the winner's litigation costs. These costs may include court fees, attorney fees, <b>witness</b> <b>fees,</b> and various other types of expenses. The loser pays principle may lead to an inability to control or even predict exposure to risk, and thus unreasonably deter public interest environmental litigation. Good practices in this category are those that help potential public interest claimants manage their risk and prevent environmental legal procedures from becoming prohibitively expensive. · Legal aid and other methods of funding for public interest lawyers and NGOs One way in which many countries address the requirement that procedures not be prohibitively expensive is to provide legal aid, or some other method of funding. Good practices in this category are those that enable meritorious environmental disputes to proceed when potential claimants lack the funds to pursue claims on their own. · Criteria for injunctions Article 9 (4) of the Aarhus Convention requires that access to justice procedures provide adequate and effective remedies, including injunctive relief. To be effective, procedures must provide a means for actually stopping an environmentally harmful activity or illegal administrative decision. Without the ability to obtain injunctive relief, serious and irreversible damage may occur before the legal dispute is decided. Good practices in this category are those that facilitate injunctive relief leading to an effective level of environmental protection. This report was commissioned for the 4 th Aarhus Convention Meeting of the Parties...|$|E
40|$|Litigation often pivots on the {{testimony}} of fact witnesses. Unfortunately, serving as a witness may take people away from their jobs or interrupt their lives. It is therefore understandable that fact witnesses may want {{to be paid for}} devoting time to litigation. It was once the rule that fact witness compensation was limited to statutory <b>witness</b> <b>fees.</b> That limitation rested on several factors, including the concern that greater payments could entice fact witnesses to perjure themselves, might simply influence witnesses to shape their testimony in ways favorable to the parties paying them, couldprice justice {{out of the reach of}} some people, and created an appearance of impropriety. On the other hand, fact witnesses may be required to devote considerable time to preparing their testimony and later testifying when called, the vast majority of witnesses faithfully honor their oaths to testify truthfully, and witnesses’ biases can be exposed on cross-examination. In any event, over time, restrictions on witness compensation have loosened. But while restrictions on compensating fact witnesses are looser than they once were, they are not lax. Lawyers and litigants may not pay fact witnesses for their testimony even if it is truthful. The general rule, in short, is that lawyers and litigants may pay witnesses for time spent testifying, preparing to testify, or assisting with thelitigation, and may reimburse witnesses’ associated expenses, provided that the amounts paid are reasonable. The general rule has major exceptions, however, as where payments are contingent upon the outcome of the litigation. Furthermore, the reasonableness of payments to fact witnesses is frequently disputed, and, even if payments to fact witnesses are reasonable, additional inducements and failures to disclose compensation-related details may be disastrous. As a result of such missteps, a court may order a new trial, sanction the lawyer or party or both, or disqualify the lawyer. In addition, the lawyer may face professional discipline, and the lawyer, party, and witness all may tempt criminal prosecution. This article examines lawyers’ and litigants’ compensation of fact witnesses, with a primary focus on lawyers’ conduct. After analyzing the issues surrounding fact witness compensation, the article offers practical guidance to lawyers weighing whether and how to compensate fact witnesse...|$|E
