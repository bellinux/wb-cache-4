2500|$|During {{the year}} of 1989, {{modifications}} to the <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator,</b> feed location and engine management netted another [...] on the turbo model. The engine mount and brace were also changed in late 1989, with the exact date not known as of this writing. The changes made to the cross member and mounts made to accommodate the 1JZ engine for Japan models. The protective body molding was also changed by taking away the steel reinforcement. This made the molding lighter and prevented the rusting problem on the previous years. The [...] "white package" [...] was introduced as well, featuring white body molding and white [...] "saw blade" [...] wheels. Interior choices were limited to blue and burgundy only. Other than pure cosmetics, there was nothing different from other models. All models received rear 3-point seat belts to replace the previous years' two-point lap belts. New tail lights, front bumper with integrated lower grille (as opposed to the previous years' detachable grille), side mirrors, turn signals, upper grilles, foglights, steering wheel, door panels, climate control, window switches and bezels, and stereo. Addition of coat hooks on B-pillar and removal of rear seat pockets round out interior changes. Turbo models received three piece spoiler with an integrated LED brake light. 1989 also {{marked the end of}} headlight washers in the US and SuperMonitor; an advanced system offered by Toyota able to calculate miles able to be traveled on current tank, ability to check vehicle codes from inside the cabin, among other features.|$|E
50|$|At the {{component}} level, boost pressure {{can either be}} bled out of the control lines or blocked outright. Either can achieve the goal of reducing pressure pushing against the wastegate. In a bleed-type system air is allowed to pass out of the control lines, reducing the load on the <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator.</b> On a blocking configuration, air traveling from the charge air supply to the <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator</b> is blocked while simultaneously bleeding any pressure that has previously built up at the <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{closed-loop control}} for a wastegate is to supply boost pressure {{directly from the}} charge air side to the <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator.</b> A small hose can connect from the turbocharger compressor outlet, charge pipes, or intake manifold to the nipple on the <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator.</b> The wastegate will open further as the boost pressure pushes against {{the force of the}} spring in the <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator</b> until equilibrium is obtained. More intelligent control can be added by integrating an electronic boost controller.|$|E
5000|$|Actuators: Mechatronic components, such as {{electric}} <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuators,</b> {{which are}} used to control the boost pressure in turbocharged engines or heating elements for fuel filters.|$|R
50|$|Standard wastegates {{have one}} port for {{attaching}} the boost control {{line from the}} charge air supply line or boost control solenoid. Recent advances in internal <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuators</b> bring dual port control.|$|R
5000|$|Also to {{be noted}} {{is the way}} in which boost control is achieved, {{depending}} on the type of wastegate used. Typically manual [...] "bleed type" [...] boost controllers are only used on swing type (single port) <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuators.</b> To increase boost, pressure is taken away from the actuator control line, therefore increasing boost. Dual port swing type <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuators</b> and external <b>wastegates</b> generally require electronic boost control although adjustable boost control can also be achieved on both of these with an air pressure regulator, this is not the same as a bleed type boost controller. To increase boost with an external or dual port wastegate, pressure is added to the top control port to increase boost. When boost control is not fitted, this control port is open to the atmosphere.|$|R

50|$|Most modern {{turbocharged}} aircraft use {{a hydraulic}} wastegate control with engine oil as the fluid. Systems from Lycoming and Continental {{operate on the}} same principles and use similar parts which differ only in name. Inside the <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator,</b> a spring acts to open the wastegate, and oil pressure acts to close the wastegate. On the oil output side of the <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator</b> sits the density controller, an air-controlled oil valve which senses upper deck pressure and controls how fast oil can bleed from the <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator</b> back to the engine. As the aircraft climbs and the air density drops, the density controller slowly closes the valve and traps more oil in the <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator,</b> closing the wastegate {{to increase the speed}} of the turbocharger and maintain rated power. Some systems also use a differential pressure controller which senses the air pressures {{on either side of the}} throttle plate and adjusts the wastegate to maintain a set differential. This maintains an optimum balance between a low turbocharger workload and a quick spool-up time, and also prevents surging caused by a bootstrapping effect.|$|E
50|$|A bleed-type manual boost {{controller}} simple {{mechanical and}} pneumatic control to allow some {{pressure from the}} <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator</b> to escape or bleed out to the atmosphere or back into the intake system. This {{can be as simple}} as a T-fitting on the boost control line near the actuator with a small bleeder screw. The screw can be turned out to varying degrees to allow air to bleed out of the system, relieving pressure on the <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator,</b> thus increasing boost levels. These devices are popular due to their negligible cost compared to other devices that may offer the same power increase.|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} modeling, {{simulating}} (transient), and designing controllers for turbocharged engine systems is presented. The method is specific to spark ignition (SI) engines equipped with pneumatic, spring diaphragm, <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuators,</b> with solenoid valve active boost control. The method {{revolves around the}} joint simulation of the engine with Ricardo WAVE software and the control algorithm with Simulink®. A component by component modeling approach is outlined using WAVE, including an experimental approach for modeling the solenoid valve. Controls are designed in MATLAB® using the Zeigler-Nichols’s PID tuning method, and a new approach that uses system identification and state-space techniques. Simulink® is then used to produce a transient simulation of the turbocharged engine system. Mechanical EngineeringMastersUniversity of New Mexico. Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringRussell, John J.

50|$|A boost {{controller}} is {{a device}} to control the boost level produced in the intake manifold of a turbocharged or supercharged engine by affecting the air pressure delivered to the pneumatic and mechanical <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator.</b>|$|E
50|$|Since less {{positive}} {{pressure can}} {{be present at}} the <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator</b> as desired boost is approached the wastegate remains closer to a completely closed state. This keeps exhaust gas routed through the turbine and increases energy transferred to {{the wheels of the}} turbocharger. Once desired boost is reached, closed loop based systems react by allowing more air pressure to reach the <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator</b> to stop the further increase in air pressure so desired boost levels are maintained. This reduces turbocharger lag and lowers boost threshold. Boost pressure builds faster when the throttle is depressed quickly and allows boost pressure to build at lower engine RPM than without such a system.|$|E
5000|$|Without a boost controller, air {{pressure}} {{is fed from}} the charge air (compressed side) of the turbocharger directly to the <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator</b> via a vacuum hose. This {{air pressure}} can come from anywhere on the intake after the turbo, including after the throttle body, though that is less common. This air pressure pushes against {{the force of a}} spring located in the <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator</b> to allow the wastegate to open and re-direct exhaust gas so that it does not reach the turbine wheel. In this simple configuration, the spring's springrate and preload determine how much boost pressure the system will achieve. Springs are classified by the boost pressure they typically achieve, such as a [...] "7 psi spring" [...] that will allow the turbocharger to reach equilibrium at approximately [...]|$|E
5000|$|To {{control the}} turbocharger, the APC {{monitors}} the engine's RPM and inlet manifold pressure via a pressure transducer, and uses these inputs {{to control a}} solenoid valve that trims the rate of rise of pressure {{as well as the}} maximum pressure by directing boost pressure to the turbocharger's pneumatic <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator.</b>|$|E
50|$|Electronic {{boost control}} adds an air control solenoid and/or a stepper motor {{controlled}} by an electronic control unit. The same general principle of a manual controller is present, {{which is to}} control the air pressure presented to the <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator.</b> Further control and intelligent algorithms can be introduced, refining and increasing control over actual boost pressure delivered to the engine.|$|E
5000|$|A ball & {{spring type}} boost {{controller}} uses {{the force of}} a spring acting against the boost pressure to control boost. This is installed with one boost signal line coming from the intake somewhere after the turbocharger, and one boost signal line going to the wastegate. A knob changes the force on the spring which in turn dictates how much pressure is on the ball. The tighter the spring, the more boost that is needed to unseat the ball, and allow the boost pressure to reach the <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator.</b> There is a bleed hole on the boost controller after the ball, to allow the pressurized air that would be trapped between the <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator</b> and the ball after it is seated again. These type of Manual boost controllers are very popular since they do not provide a boost leak, allowing faster spool times and better control than a [...] "bleed type" [...] boost controller.|$|E
5000|$|Boost {{controllers}} {{often use}} {{pulse width modulation}} (PWM) techniques to bleed off boost pressure {{on its way to}} the reference port on the <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator</b> diaphragm in order to (on occasion [...] ) under report boost pressure in such a way that the wastegate permits a turbocharger to build more boost pressure in the intake than it normally could. In effect, a boost-control solenoid valve lies to the wastegate under the engine control unit´s (ECU) control. The boost control solenoid contains a needle valve that can open and close very quickly. By varying the pulse width to the solenoid, the solenoid valve can be commanded to be open a certain percentage of the time. This effectively alters the flow rate of air pressure through the valve, changing the rate at which air bleeds out of the T in the manifold pressure reference line to the wastegate. This effectively changes the air pressure as seen by the <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator</b> diaphragm. Solenoids may require small diameter restrictors be installed in the air control lines to limit airflow and even out the on/off nature of their operation.|$|E
50|$|The solenoid and {{stepper motors}} {{also need to}} be {{installed}} in such a way to maximize the advantages of failure modes. For instance, if a solenoid is installed to control boost electronically, it should be installed such that if the solenoid fails in the most common failure mode (probably non-energized position) the boost control falls back to simple <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator</b> boost levels. It is possible a solenoid or stepper motor could get stuck in a position that lets no boost pressure reach the wastegate, causing boost to quickly rise out of control.|$|E
5000|$|The basic {{algorithm}} sometimes {{involves the}} EMS (engine management system) [...] "learning" [...] {{how quickly the}} turbocharger can spool and how quickly the boost pressure increases. Armed with this knowledge, as long as boost pressure is below a predetermined allowable ceiling, the EMS will open the boost control solenoid to allow the turbocharger to create overboost beyond what the wastegate would normally allow. As overboost reaches the programmable maximum, the EMS begins to decrease the bleed rate through the control solenoid to raise boost pressure as seen at the <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator</b> diaphragm so the wastegate opens enough to limit boost to the maximum configured level of over-boost.|$|E
5000|$|To detect knock, a {{piezoelectric}} {{knock sensor}} (basically a microphone) {{bolted to the}} engine block responds to unique frequencies caused by engine knock. The sensor generates a small voltage that {{is sent to the}} electronic control unit, which processes the signal to determine if, in fact, knock is occurring. If it is, then the control unit activates a solenoid valve that directs boost pressure to the turbocharger's pneumatically controlled <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator,</b> which opens the wastegate to bypass exhaust gases from the turbocharger directly to the exhaust pipe, lowering turbo boost pressure until the knock subsides. Knock events that are managed by the APC can be [...] "seen" [...] when the in-dash boost needle [...] "twitches" [...] slightly. The APC unit has a 'knock' output where an LED may be connected. This LED will then light up if knock is detected. The pictured APC gauge has this custom LED fitted {{at the end of the}} red scale. Because the knock sensor becomes less accurate at high revolutions, the APC tapers maximum boost pressure after approximately 4,500 RPM.|$|E

5000|$|In 2007, quite {{a number}} of changes were made to the US-spec STI. Due to Subaru's {{decision}} to reduce costs by cutting the amount of aluminum used, the US-spec STI no longer receives the J-spec Spec C control arms. The control arms are now the aluminum ones used on the Japan-spec revision A and B non-Spec C STis. The high caster angle has been reduced, which in turn reduces the wheelbase from 100" [...] to 99.4". The rear sway bar has decreased in size from 20 mm to 19 mm. The gear ratios of second, third and fourth gears have been made longer (higher ratio) in order to improve fuel economy and drivability, which inadvertently reduces 1/4 mile drag racing times due to the ability to trap 114 mi/h km/h in 4th gear, without the shift to 5th. The transmission oil pump that was deleted in the 2006 model year was also brought back for the 07 model year transmission. The EJ257's cylinder heads have been redesigned to improve cooling, and the sodium-filled exhaust valves have been deleted. Pistons are the same as previous years. The alternator is changed from a 90A rating to 110 amps. The rear Limited Slip Differential is now a Torsen unit, considered an upgrade over the previous model's clutch type unit. The turbo has also been changed to the VF43, which has a different <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator</b> than the VF39. The side cowl braces are stiffer than the 2006MY. The engine mounts are once again the hard rubber mounts used prior to 2006. On the interior, there is an audio jack that replaces the ashtray, a rear center armrest with trunk pass-through and a 120 W audio system.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master thesis is to {{investigate}} the possibility to refine the control system of turbochargers in petrol engines by introducing turbo speed measurement. This thesis also investigates possible control enhancement from an electric <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator</b> compared with a traditional pneumatic actuator. During the thesis work the control problem is divided into 3 sub systems: boost pressure controller, turbo speed controller, and electric actuator controller. The design procedure of the controllers follows model-based method in which a simulation model for engine and a simulation model for electric actuator are used. The designed controller is then implemented and evaluated in an engine test cell. The result of the thesis work shows that the electric <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator</b> is preferred as it delivers consistent actuation speed and accurate positioning which favours model-based design that requires exact wastegate position. Although the purposed controller structure that uses turbo speed measurement cannot yet achieve faster generation of boost pressure {{by the end of}} the thesis work, the use of turbo speed sensor as controller feedback still shows potential to enhance the boost controller and ease the controller design, as the turbo speed measurement can reflect the boost pressure faster and is less sensitive to the disturbances in the air flow...|$|E
40|$|The torque {{response}} of an engine {{is important for}} driver acceptance. For turbocharged spark ignited (TCSI) engines this is tightly connected to the boost pressure control, which is usually achieved with a wastegate. A challenging scenario is when the throttle is fully open and the load is essentially controlled by the wastegate. First {{a model for the}} pneumatic <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator</b> and air control solenoid is developed. The wastegate model consists of three submodels; the actuator pressure, the static position, and an additional position dynamics. A complete engine model is constructed by including the actuator model in a Mean Value Engine Model (MVEM) for a TCSI engine. This model describes the transient boost pressure response to steps in wastegate control inputs. The subsystems and complete MVEM are validated on an engine test bench and it explains the overshoot seen in the step responses. The model is used to study the system response and give insight into the dominating phenomena and it points out that the engine speed is important for the response. Further, for each speed it is sufficient to model the system as a second order linear system, that captures an overshoot. A controller consisting of a mapped feedforward loop and a gain scheduled feedback loop is developed together with a tuning method based on the IMC framework for the feedback loop. The controller and tuning method is shown to achieve the desired boost pressure behavior both on the complete MVEM and on real engines. The experimental validation is carried out both in an engine test cell and in a vehicle. Keywords: Engine modeling, engine control, turbocharging, internal model control, PID. 1...|$|E
40|$|The torque {{response}} of the engine {{is important for the}} driving experience of a vehicle. In spark ignited engines, torque is proportional to the air flow into the cylinders. Controlling torque therefore implies controlling air flow. In modern turbocharged engines, the driver commands are interpreted by an electronic control unit that controls the engine through electromechanical and pneumatic actuators. Air flow to the intake manifold is controlled by an electronic throttle, and a wastegate controls the energy to the turbine, affecting boost pressure and air flow. These actuators and their dynamics affect the torque response and a lot of time is put into calibration of controllers for these actuators. By modeling and understanding the actuator behavior this dynamics can be compensated for, leaving a reduced control problem, which can shorten the calibration time. Electronic throttle servo control is the first problem studied. By constructing a control oriented model for the throttle servo and inverting that model, the resulting controller becomes two static compensators for friction and limp-home nonlinearities, together with a PD-controller. A gain-scheduled I-part is added for robustness to handle model errors. The sensitivity to model errors is studied and a method for tuning the controller is presented. The performance has been evaluated in simulation, in test vehicle, and in a throttle control benchmark. A model for a pneumatic <b>wastegate</b> <b>actuator</b> and solenoid control valve, used for boost pressure control, is presented. The actuator dynamics is shown to be important for the transient boost pressure response. The model is incorporated in a mean value engine model and shown to give accurate description of the transient response. A tuning method for the  feedback (PID) part of a boost controller is proposed, based on step responses in wastegate control signal. Together with static feedforward the controller is shown to achieve the desired boost pressure response. Submodels for an advanced boost control system consisting of several vacuum actuators, solenoid valves, a vacuum tank and a vacuum pump are developed. The submodels and integrated system are evaluated on a two stage series sequential turbo system, and control with system voltage disturbance rejection is demonstrated on an engine in a test cell. Turbocharged V-type engines often have two parallel turbochargers, each powered by one bank of cylinders. When the two air paths are connected before the throttle an unwanted oscillation can occur. When the compressors operate close to the surge line and a disturbance alters the mass flow balance, the compressors can begin to alternately go into surge, this is called co-surge. Measurements on co-surge in parallel turbocharged engines are presented and analyzed. A mean value engine model, augmented with a Moore-Greitzer compressor model to handle surge, is shown to capture the cosurge behavior. A sensitivity analysis shows which model parameters have the largest influence of the phenomena. The compressor operation in the map during co-surge is studied, and the alternating compressor speeds are shown to {{have a major impact on}} the continuing oscillation. Based on the analysis, detection methods and a controller are proposed, these detect co-surge and control the turbo speeds to match during co-surge. The controller is evaluated both in simulation and on a test vehicle in a vehicle dynamometer, showing that co-surge can be detected and the oscillations quelled...|$|E
