In his role as USAF Deputy Chief of Staff for Development, Saville helped direct missile work, but soon replaced himself on the GMIORG with Major General Robert M. Lee, commander of TAC.

5|$|The rumours were correct. In 1845, the MacLean laird {{sold the}} island to the Marquess of Salisbury, who {{converted}} Rùm into an estate for country sports.

5|$|Weber's {{methodology}} {{was developed}} {{in the context of a}} wider debate about methodology of social sciences, the Methodenstreit. Weber's position was close to historicism, as he understood social actions as being heavily tied to particular historical contexts and its analysis required the understanding of subjective motivations of individuals (social actors). Thus Weber's methodology emphasises the use of comparative historical analysis. Therefore, Weber <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in explaining how a certain outcome was the result of various historical processes rather than predicting an outcome of those processes in the future.|$|E
5|$|Authentic {{gardens of}} the yeoman cottager would have {{included}} a beehive and livestock, and frequently a pig and sty, {{along with a}} well. The peasant cottager of medieval times <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in meat than flowers, with herbs grown for medicinal use and cooking, rather than for their beauty. By Elizabethan times there was more prosperity, and thus more room to grow flowers. Even the early cottage garden flowers typically had their practical use—violets were spread on the floor (for their pleasant scent and keeping out vermin); calendulas and primroses were both attractive and used in cooking. Others, such as sweet william and hollyhocks were grown entirely for their beauty.|$|E
5|$|Columbia Pictures {{executive}} Amy Pascal suggested Angelina Jolie to Noyce, who {{had often}} spoken to Jolie {{in the past}} about a desire to create a female spy franchise. Pascal even invited Jolie for a Bond girl role, but the actress playfully replied that she <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in playing James Bond himself instead. Jolie was sent Salts script in September 2008 and liked it. Wimmer, Noyce, and producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura went to visit Jolie {{at her home in}} France to discuss a possible script and character change. Writer Brian Helgeland helped with the character development and dialogue of the script based on the notes that came out of those discussions with Jolie and to accompany the gender change, the title character's name was changed to Evelyn Salt.|$|E

For a while, he wanted to become a professional golfer. While in high school, Mitsuda rediscovered music, inspired by Vangelis' Blade Runner and Henry Mancini's The Pink Panther film scores. After watching Railman, he decided to become a music composer. He became interested in PCs after his father bought him one, which was a rare item at the time. He started to program computer games and compose music for them, as well as take more technically oriented classes.|$|E
5|$|Ray {{considered}} {{making a}} {{film on the}} Bangladesh Liberation War but later abandoned the idea. He said that, as a filmmaker, he <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in the travails of the refugees and not the politics. In 1977, Ray completed Shatranj Ke Khiladi (The Chess Players), a Hindi film based on a story by Munshi Premchand. It was set in Lucknow {{in the state of}} Oudh, a year before the Indian rebellion of 1857. A commentary on issues related to the colonisation of India by the British, this was Ray's first feature film in a language other than Bengali. It is his most expensive and star-studded film, featuring Sanjeev Kumar, Saeed Jaffrey, Amjad Khan, Shabana Azmi, Victor Bannerjee and Richard Attenborough.|$|E
5|$|Vandersteen was creatively active {{from his}} youth. He drew {{pictures}} with crayons on sidewalks, and invented stories {{for his friends}} about knights and legends. He even convinced his young friends to buy him crayons so he could depict the local cycling championship. At school as well, he <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in telling stories and learning about art than anything else. His best memory of these schooldays is of a teacher who {{introduced him to the}} works of Pieter Brueghel. Outside school, {{he spent most of his}} time with comic magazines and adventure books by Jules Verne or books about Nick Carter and Buffalo Bill. At 13, he enrolled at the Academie voor Schone Kunsten in Antwerp to study sculpture, and two years later he started working as sculptor and decorator, just like his father.|$|E

40|$|Our {{research}} {{focused on}} the vocational interests correlated with the Dark Triad traits (i. e., narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism). By understanding how these traits facilitate the structuring of one’s environment, we hypothesized that psychopaths will <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in realistic and practical careers, narcissists will <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in artistic, enterprising, and social careers, and Machiavellians will <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in avoiding careers that involve caring for others. In two cross-sectional studies (N = 424; N = 274), we provide general support for these hypotheses. Overall, our study showed those high on the Dark Triad traits may structure their social environment through idealized career preferences. We also show that sex differences in career preferences might be a function, in part of, individual differences in the Dark Triad traits...|$|R
5|$|With {{the death}} of Theoktistos, the regency was at an end; in early 856, Michael proclaimed his {{assumption}} of full imperial power, and in 857 Theodora was forced to retire to the Gastria Monastery. Nevertheless, as Michael <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in his pleasures and his continuing affair with Eudokia Ingerina, Bardas now became the de facto regent of the Empire. By ca. 858 {{he was promoted to}} the highest state offices (magistros and chartoularios tou kanikleiou), followed by his promotion to kouropalates—according to Symeon Logothetes, this happened after a failed assassination attempt masterminded by Theodora—and finally, on 22 (or 26) April 862, to Caesar. Petronas also emerged from obscurity at the same time, becoming strategos of the Thracesian Theme and leading a series of successful raids against the Arabs.|$|E
5|$|According to Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen, it took long {{to persuade}} Meisdalshagen to even take the post as Minister of Finance, and he <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in agro-economical {{questions}} than traditional planning of the economy. It was even said that Gerhardsen's Cabinet {{had an interest}} in luring Meisdalshagen away from the Parliament, where he had driven through significant increases in farmer's income, threatening the overall balance and planning of the state finances. In fact the income from farming, measured in the amount of money earned per decare, was doubled between the war's end in 1945 and 1950, when the Main Agreement for Agriculture, , was introduced. It regulated future price negotiations, and institutionalized the negotiating partners: the state {{on one side of the}} table, the Norwegian Agrarian Association and the Norwegian Farmers and Smallholders Union on the other.|$|E
5|$|Benchley re-entered Hollywood at {{the height}} of the Great Depression and the {{large-scale}} introduction of the talkie films he had begun working with years before. His arrival put him on the scene of a number of productions almost instantly. While Benchley <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in writing than acting, one of his more important roles as an actor was as a salesman in Rafter Romance, and his work attracted the interest of MGM, who offered Benchley a lot of money to complete a series of short films. Benchley, who had also been offered a syndicated column by Hearst, was able to film the shorts in New York and keep up with his new column. Before heading back to New York, Benchley took a role in the feature film Dancing Lady (1933), which also featured Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, Fred Astaire, Nelson Eddy, and the Three Stooges.|$|E

50|$|Different {{people have}} {{different}} reactions to sexual {{content in the}} media. Men <b>are</b> <b>more</b> likely to <b>be</b> aroused by the sexual content than women. Gettleman argued that men are main consumers of sex videos, with an estimated 71 of sex videos consumed by men by themselves. It {{does not mean that}} men <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in sex videos than women. Women have been found to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in written and directed by women and for women, while men appear to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in seek out sexual media and be aroused by it. Malamuth and Check found that men, not women, were as aroused by a rape scene as by a consenting sex scene but only if the victim was portrayed as enjoying the rape and coming to orgasm. The men were not aroused if the victim was shown to be terrorized.|$|R

5|$|Christopher Eccleston was {{the only}} one of the four lead actors who was already an {{established}} television face, having previously co-starred in the ITV crime drama series Cracker. Eccleston first heard about the project while working with Danny Boyle on the film Shallow Grave in the autumn of 1993. Initially, Eccleston had been considered by the production team as a candidate to play Geordie, but he <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in playing Nicky, who he saw as a more emotionally complex character. Eccleston was particularly concerned about being able to successfully perform with the Newcastle Geordie accent. He did not even attempt the accent at his audition, concentrating instead on characterisation. He drew inspiration for his performance as the older Nicky from Peter Flannery himself, basing aspects of his characterisation on Flannery's personality. He even wore some of the writer's own colourful shirts.|$|E
5|$|George Villiers (23 November 1759 – 21 March 1827), styled The Honourable, was a British courtier and {{politician}} {{from the}} Villiers family. The youngest {{son of the}} diplomat Lord Hyde (later Earl of Clarendon), he was an intimate of Princess Amelia and personal supporter of her father, George III. His favour within the Royal Family and his father's influence brought him a number of sinecures to support him. However, Villiers <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> {{in the operation of}} the royal farms at Windsor Castle than in politics or the duties of his offices. When his bookkeeping as Paymaster of the Marines was carefully examined in 1810, Villiers' carelessness and the speculation of his clerk had left him in debt to the Crown by more than £250,000. This exposure touched off a public scandal; Villiers promptly surrendered all his property to the Crown and threw himself on the king's mercy. The misconduct of Joseph Hunt as Treasurer of the Ordnance to some extent obscured Villiers' own misconduct, {{and he was able to}} retain other sinecures and a stable, if reduced, income from them until his death in 1827.|$|E
5|$|In November 1978, Christina Crawford {{published}} Mommie Dearest, {{which contained}} allegations that her late adoptive mother was emotionally and physically abusive to Christina {{and her brother}} Christopher because she <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>interested</b> in her career than in being a mother. Many of Crawford's friends and co-workers, including Van Johnson, Ann Blyth, Marlene Dietrich, Myrna Loy, Katharine Hepburn, Cesar Romero, Gary Gray, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (Crawford's first husband), and Crawford's two other younger daughters—Cathy and Cindy—denounced the book, categorically denying any abuse. But others, including Betty Hutton, Helen Hayes, James MacArthur (Hayes' son), June Allyson, Liz Smith, Rex Reed, and Vincent Sherman stated they had witnessed some form of abusive behavior. Crawford's secretary, Jeri Binder Smith, confirmed Christina's account. Mommie Dearest became a bestseller and was made into the 1981 biographical film Mommie Dearest, starring Faye Dunaway as Crawford.|$|E
