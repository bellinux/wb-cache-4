500|$|There {{are many}} {{indications}} of close relations between Kent and the Franks. Æthelberht's marriage to Bertha certainly connected the two courts, {{although not as}} equals: the Franks <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Æthelberht as an under-king. There is no record that Æthelberht ever accepted a continental king as his overlord and, as a result, historians are divided on {{the true nature of}} the relationship. Evidence for an explicit Frankish overlordship of Kent comes from a letter written by Pope Gregory the Great to Theuderic, king of Orléans, and Theudebert, king of Metz. The letter concerned Augustine's mission to Kent in 597, and in it Gregory says that he believes [...] "that you wish your subjects in every respect to be converted to that faith in which you, their kings and lords, stand". It may be that this is a papal compliment, rather than a description of the relationship between the kingdoms. It also has been suggested that Liudhard, Bertha's chaplain, was intended as a representative of the Frankish church in Kent, which also could be interpreted as evidence of overlordship.|$|E
500|$|Jocelin and {{his family}} {{probably}} came from the south-east of Scotland. The names of neither his father nor his mother are known, but he had two known brothers, with the names Helia and Henry, and a cousin, also called Helia. The names suggest that his family were of French, or at least Anglo-Norman origin, rather than being a Scot or native Anglo-Saxon. There are some indications that his family held land in South Lanarkshire, namely because {{they seem to have}} possessed rights in the church of Dunsyre. It is unlikely that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> himself as [...] "Scottish". For Jocelin's contemporary and fellow native of the Borders, Adam of Dryburgh, this part of Britain was still firmly regarded as terra Anglorum (the [...] "Land of English"), although it was located inside the regnum Scottorum (the [...] "Kingdom of the Scots"). This would be no obstacle to Jocelin, however. His Anglo-French cultural background was in fact probably necessary for the patronage of the King of Scots. As Walter of Coventry wrote of King William's era, [...] "the modern kings of Scotland count themselves as Frenchmen, in race, manners, language and culture; they keep only Frenchmen in their household and following, and have reduced the Scots to utter servitude".|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} {{two young}} fellers that was shipmates with me some years ago, and they was such out-and-out pals that everybody called 'em the Siamese twins. They always shipped together and shared lodgings together when they was ashore, and Ted Denver <b>would</b> no more <b>'ave</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> going out without Charlie Brice than Charlie Brice <b>would</b> <b>'ave</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> going out without 'im. They shared their baccy and {{their money and}} everything else, and it's my opinion that if they 'ad only 'ad one pair o' boots between 'em they'd 'ave hopped along in one each.|$|R

500|$|... "I Wanna Go" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Max Martin and Shellback, with additional writing by Savan Kotecha. The song {{was written in}} 2009 and registered on Broadcast Music Incorporated under the legal title [...] "I I I Wanna Go O O". On February 22, 2011, Spears posted on her Twitter account a link to a 29-second clip of the song, while calling Martin [...] "amazing". In an interview with Rolling Stone, Spears stated that the song's signature whistle gets her [...] "every time [...] hears it", adding that Martin's melodies are [...] "Incredible... Who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> that? There is nobody I feel more comfortable collaborating with in the studio." [...] Kotecha told Digital Spy in May 2011 that the song was likely a contender for third single due to positive reaction. On May 11, 2011, a poll was launched on Britney.com in which fans could choose the third single of the album. Two days later, [...] "I Wanna Go" [...] was officially announced as the third single from Femme Fatale by Jive Records through a press release after winning the poll. [...] The cover art was revealed on June 6, 2011, and featured Spears on set of the music video, wearing colored hair extensions and a top with a skeletal Mickey Mouse.|$|E
2500|$|Hipparchus also {{discovered}} that the equinoctial points moved along the ecliptic (plane of the Earth's orbit, or what Hipparchus <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as {{the plane of the}} Sun's orbit about the Earth) in a direction opposite that of the movement of the Sun, a phenomenon that came to be named [...] "precession of the equinoxes". He reckoned the value as 1° per century, a value that was not improved upon until about 1000 years later, by Islamic astronomers. Since this discovery a distinction has been made between the tropical year and the sidereal year [...]|$|E
2500|$|He {{had never}} held office but {{demonstrated}} energy, executive ability, and political astuteness. He consulted widely within his party, making the Liberal Lord Haldane the Lord Chancellor, and Philip Snowden Chancellor of the Exchequer. He took the foreign office himself. Besides himself, ten other cabinet members came from working class origins, a dramatic breakthrough in British history. His first priority was {{to undo the}} damage caused by the harsh 1919 Treaty of Versailles, by settling the reparations issue and coming to terms with Germany. The king noted in his diary, [...] "He wishes to do the right thing.... Today 23 years ago dear Grandmama died. I wonder what she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> a Labour Government!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The next day, {{before the}} airing of the show, Duckett shot herself, a death that {{relatives}} claim {{was influenced by}} media scrutiny, particularly from Grace. Speaking to The Orlando Sentinel, Duckett's grandfather Bill Eubank said, [...] "Nancy Grace and the others, they just bashed her to the end. She was not one anyone ever <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> {{to do something like}} this." [...] CNN has also been criticized for allowing the show to air in the wake of Duckett's suicide. Police investigating the case had not named Melinda Duckett as a suspect in the case at the time, but after her suicide the police did say that, as nearly all parents are in missing-child cases, she was a suspect from the beginning.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{insanity}} explanation {{was not uncommon}} during Swedenborg's own time, it is mitigated by his activity in the Swedish Riddarhuset (The House of the Nobility), the Riksdag (the Swedish parliament), and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Additionally, the system of thought in his theological writings is considered {{by some to be}} remarkably coherent. [...] Furthermore, he was characterized by his contemporaries as a [...] "kind and warm-hearted man", [...] "amiable in his meeting with the public", speaking [...] "easily and naturally of his spiritual experiences", with pleasant and interesting conversation... An English friend of Kant's who visited Swedenborg at Kant's behest described Swedenborg as a [...] "reasonable, pleasant and candid man and scholar". Of note here is Swedenborg's statement that he was commanded by the Lord to publish his writings and [...] "Do not believe that without this express command I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> publishing things which I knew in advance would make me look ridiculous and many people would think lies..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Catherine Hills {{points out}} that it is too easy to {{consider}} Anglo-Saxon archaeology solely as a study of ethnology and to fail to consider that identity is [...] "less related to an overall Anglo-Saxon ethnicity and more to membership of family or tribe, Christian or pagan, elite or peasant". [...] "Anglo-Saxons" [...] or [...] "Britons" [...] were no more homogeneous than nationalities are today, and they would have exhibited diverse characteristics: male/female, old/young, rich/poor, farmer/warrior—or even Gildas' patria (fellow citizens), cives (indigenous people) and hostes (enemies)—as well as a diversity associated with language. Beyond these, in the early Anglo-Saxon period, identity was local: although people would have known their neighbours, it may have been important to indicate tribal loyalty with details of clothing and especially fasteners. It is also unlikely that people <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> themselves as Anglo-Saxon: instead {{they were part of a}} tribe or region, descendants of a patron or followers of a leader. It is this identity that archaeological evidence seeks to understand and determine, considering how it might support separate identity groups, or identities that were inter-connected.|$|E

25|$|Even after {{crowning}} himself Emperor Wu, Liu Yu remained frugal. However, he did {{not care}} for education and trusted unsavory people. He felt that the nobility had too much power, so he tended to appoint the lower classes to government positions and gave military power to imperial kinsmen. Ironically, because the imperial kinsmen stabilized their military power and wished to gain political power, Emperor Wu was afraid they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> usurping the throne. Thus, he also frequently killed his kinsmen.|$|R

2500|$|Adlai Stevenson {{enjoyed his}} role as vice president, {{presiding}} over the U.S. Senate, [...] "the most august legislative assembly known to men." [...] He won praise for ruling in a dignified, nonpartisan manner. In personal appearance he stood six feet tall and was [...] "of fine personal bearing and uniformly courteous to all." [...] Although he was often a guest at the White House, Stevenson admitted that he was less {{an adviser to the}} president than [...] "the neighbor to his counsels." [...] He credited the President with being [...] "courteous at all times" [...] but noted that [...] "no guards were necessary to the preservation of his dignity. No one <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> undue familiarity." [...] For his part, President Cleveland snorted that the Vice President had surrounded himself with a coterie of free-silver men dubbed the [...] "Stevenson cabinet." [...] The president even mused that the economy had gotten so bad and the Democratic party so divided that [...] "the logical thing for me to do ... was to resign and hand the Executive branch to Mr. Stevenson," [...] joking that he would try to get his friends jobs in Stevenson's new cabinet.|$|E
2500|$|In 1836 the Beagle voyage visited Ascension. Charles Darwin {{described}} it as an arid treeless island, with nothing growing near the coast. Sparse vegetation inland supported [...] "about six hundred sheep, many goats, a few cows & horses", large numbers of guineafowl imported from the Cape Verde islands, rats, mice, and land crabs; he agreed with the saying attributed {{to the people of}} St Helena that [...] "We know we live on a rock, but the poor people at Ascension live on a cinder". He noted the care taken to sustain [...] "houses, gardens & fields placed near the summit of the central mountain", and cisterns at roadsides to provide drinking water. The springs were carefully managed, [...] "so that a single drop of water may not be lost: indeed the whole island may be compared to a huge ship kept in first-rate order." [...] In commenting on this, he noted René Primevère Lesson's remark [...] "that the English nation alone <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> making the island of Ascension a productive spot; any other people would have held it as a mere fortress in the ocean." ...|$|E
