500|$|As Germany {{defeated}} [...] France in 1940, President Roosevelt proposed giving Britain munitions {{to fight}} back. [...] Senator Wheeler declared [...] "the lend-lease-give {{program is the}} New Deal's triple-A foreign policy; it will plow under every fourth American boy." [...] Roosevelt shot back, by denouncing “those <b>who</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> plowing under every fourth American child, which I regard as the most untruthful, as the most dastardly, unpatriotic thing that has ever been said." [...] To stop the movement toward war Senator Wheeler and the Chicago Tribune published {{the full text of}} the Army's top secret war plan Rainbow 5 {{a few days before the}} attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.|$|E
2500|$|One nurse, Vera Brittain, wrote: [...] "I wish {{those people}} <b>who</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> {{going on with}} this war {{whatever}} it costs could see the soldiers suffering from mustard gas poisoning. Great mustard-coloured blisters, blind eyes, all sticky and stuck together, always fighting for breath, with voices a mere whisper, saying that their throats are closing and they know they will choke." ...|$|E

[...] Upon Walsh's {{departure}} from the show, Jones has appeared alone as Miss Enid.

2500|$|W. G. Grace {{brought out}} an English {{team in the}} 1873-74 season, and Cosstick’s bowling, along with the batting of Bransby Cooper and John Conway and the bowling of Frank Allan and Harry Boyle were {{responsible}} for the visitors’ defeat by an innings by Eighteen of Victoria. [...] Impressive though the result was, a newspaper correspondent wrote [...] "any numbskulls <b>who</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Eleven Victorian natives playing this Eleven of England are prattling about what they don’t understand." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unlike Fellini’s film {{discussed}} below, the {{caricature of}} the Satyricon does not deform the everyday {{life of the}} Roman people. [...] Petronius uses real names for all his characters, most of them laypeople, <b>who</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the theatre of ancient Rome, the amphitheatre and the circus with the same enthusiasm of today’s fans of football and other team sports. If there is parody in the Satyricon {{it is not about}} the main characters—Encolpius, Giton and Ascyltos—but of the described social reality, and the literary genres of certain famous poets and writers, Homer, Plato, Virgil and Cicero included. Petronius's realism has a Greek antecedent in Aristophanes, who also abandoned the epical tone to focus on ordinary subjects.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I thought, [...] "you have learnt {{something}} to-day; it {{does not}} do, you see, hastily to despise those distant relatives of yours, <b>who</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> pauperising and molly-coddling the lower classes. No, no! One must look deeper than that! One must have generosity!" ...|$|E

60|$|Socially, {{we may be}} all easily {{divided into}} two classes in this world--at least in the civilized part of it.

6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} {{once and for}} all," [...] cried Mr. Cumberland Vane, rapping his {{knuckles}} angrily on the table, [...] "I tell you, once and for all, my man, that I will not have you turning on any religious rant or cant here. Don't imagine that it will impress me. The most religious people are not those <b>who</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it. (Applause.) You answer the questions and do nothing else." ...|$|E
60|$|Those thinkers who cannot {{believe in}} any gods often {{assert that the}} love of {{humanity}} would be in itself sufficient for them; and so, perhaps, it would, if they had it. There {{is a very real}} thing which may be called the love of humanity; in our time it exists almost entirely among what are called uneducated people; and it does not exist at all among the people <b>who</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it.|$|E

60|$|Pen {{was forced}} to confess that the {{literary}} personages {{with whom he had}} become acquainted had not said much, {{in the course of the}} night's conversation, that was worthy to be remembered or quoted. In fact not one word about literature had been said during the whole course of the night:--and it may be whispered to those uninitiated people who are anxious to know the habits and make the acquaintance of men of letters, that there are no race of people <b>who</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> books, or, perhaps, who read books, so little as literary men.|$|E
6000|$|... "A decent {{community}} never yet asked a man {{to tread}} on his self-respect. If I get my fingers skinned over my marriage, which I undertake at my own risk, what's the community to do with it? D'you think I'm going to whine to it to put the plaster on? As to rights, it'd be a deuced sight better for us all if there wasn't such a fuss about 'em. Leave that to women! I don't give a tinker's damn for men <b>who</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> their rights in such matters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, {{it is very}} {{remarkable}} that this is so extensively overlooked,' continued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of cheerfulness. 'Really {{this is what is}} meant by the Fourth Dimension, though some people <b>who</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the Fourth Dimension do not know they mean it. It is only another way of looking at Time. There is no difference between Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our consciousness moves along it. But some foolish people have got hold of the wrong side of that idea. You have all heard {{what they have to say}} about this Fourth Dimension?' ...|$|E

6000|$|I have {{no respect}} for the {{penetration}} of any man who can read the report of that conversation, and still call the principal in it insane. It has the ring of a saner sanity than an ordinary discipline and habits of life, than an ordinary organization, secure. Take any sentence of it,--"Any questions that I can honorably answer, I will; not otherwise. So far as I am myself concerned, I have told everything truthfully. I value my word, sir." [...] The few <b>who</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> his vindictive spirit, while they really admire his heroism, have no test by which to detect a noble man, no amalgam to combine with his pure gold. They mix their own dross with it.|$|E

I hate people <b>who</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> themselves, as you do, when one {{wants to talk about}} oneself, as I do. It is what I call {{selfishness}}, and selfishness is a most detestable thing, especially to any one of my temperament, for I am well known for my sympathetic nature. In fact, you should take example by me; you could not possibly have a better model. Now that you have the chance you had better avail yourself of it, for I am going back to Court almost immediately. I am a great favourite at Court; in fact, the Prince and Princess were married yesterday in my honour. Of course you know nothing of these matters, for you are a provincial." ...|$|E

60|$|That sort {{of thing}} must be left to people <b>who</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the Anglo-Saxon race, and extend the {{expression}} to America. How much of {{the blood of the}} Angles and Saxons (whoever they were) there remains in our mixed British, Roman, German, Dane, Norman, and Picard stock is a matter only interesting to wild antiquaries. And how much of that diluted blood can possibly remain in that roaring whirlpool of America into which a cataract of Swedes, Jews, Germans, Irishmen, and Italians is perpetually pouring, is a matter only interesting to lunatics. It would have been wiser for the English governing class to have called upon some other god. All other gods, however weak and warring, at least boast of being constant. But science boasts of being in a flux for ever; boasts of being unstable as water.|$|E
6000|$|She {{had taken}} up a fan from the table, and held it, now between her face and the fire, and now between her face and him. Her little visage, with that arch, lazy look in it, topped by its mass of dusky hair, and dwindling from the full cheeks to the small chin, had a Japanese effect in the subdued light, and it had the charm which comes to any woman with happiness. It {{would be hard to}} say how much of this she {{perceived}} that he felt. They talked about other things a while, and then she came back to what he had said. She glanced at him obliquely round her fan, and stopped moving it. [...] "Does Irene talk about me?" [...] she asked. [...] "I think so--yes. Perhaps it's only I <b>who</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> you. You must blame me if it's wrong," [...] he returned.|$|E
60|$|When men {{of science}} (or, more often, men <b>who</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> science) speak of {{studying}} history or human society scientifically they always forget {{that there are}} two quite distinct questions involved. It may be that certain facts of the body go with certain facts of the soul, but it by no means follows that a grasp of such facts of the body goes with a grasp of the things of the soul. A man may show very learnedly that certain mixtures of race make a happy community, but he may be quite wrong (he generally is) about what communities are happy. A man may explain scientifically how a certain physical type involves a really bad man, but he may be quite wrong (he generally is) about which sort of man is really bad. Thus his whole argument is useless, for he understands only one half of the equation.|$|E
