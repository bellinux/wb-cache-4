40|$|This paper {{develops}} and analyzes a queueing {{model to}} examine the role of patient choice on {{the high rate of}} organ refusals in the kidney transplant <b>waiting</b> <b>system.</b> The model is an M/M/ 1 queue with homogeneous patients and exponential reneging. Patients join the <b>waiting</b> <b>system</b> and organ transplants are reflected by the service process. In addition, unlike the standard M/M/ 1 model, each service instance is associated with a variable reward that reflects the quality of the transplant organ, and patients have the option to refuse an organ (service) offer if they expect future offers to be better. Under an assumption of perfect and complete information, it is demonstrated that the queueing discipline is a potent instrument {{that can be used to}} maximize social welfare. In particular, First-Come First-Serve (FCFS) amplifies patients ’ desire to refuse offers of marginal quality, and generates excessive organ wastage. By contrast, Last-Come First-Serve (LCFS) contains the inefficiencies engendered by patient choice and achieves optimal organ utilization. A numerical example calibrated using data from the US transplantation system demonstrates that the welfare improvements possible from a better control of patient choice are equivalent to a 25 % increase in the supply of organs...|$|E

In this paper, we have applied SimuCall to a real call centre in order to improve its efficiency.

Furthermore, SimuCall is capable of providing a great quantity of information, at both aggregated and individual levels, through a variety of data and graphic reports. ...|$|E
40|$|Basically {{a railway}} network {{consists}} of the infrastructure elements lines, station track groups and route nodes. Route nodes contain the switch zones in {{the front end of}} stations, linking the adjacent lines and the station tracks. Thereby train runs can be operated simultaneously, if they do not exclude each other. Analytical methods for capacity assessment are available for lines and station track groups, but for route nodes only some rudimental approaches exist. In this paper different methods will be deduced to compute the capacity characteristics theoretical capacity, loss probability, waiting probability, scheduled waiting time and unscheduled waiting time for a route node. The new approach uses a multiresource queue from queuing theory to model a route node. Because of the multi-channel feature of a route node two or even more train runs can be operated simultaneously. To achieve the theoretical capacity of the system, train runs have to be arranged optimally. To maximise the capacity it is necessary to bundle parallel train runs instead of operating them sequentially. In this publication a mathematical approach will be presented to calculate the theoretical capacity by means of linear optimisation. To determine the loss probability two different formulas are presented. Generally the complexity of the computation increases rapidly with the size of the route node. To cope with this problem an algorithm is described, which divides the system in several subsystems. These subsystems can be handled separately. Merging the results finally provides an exact result for the overall system. To estimate the waiting probability the loss probability is used in first instance. This is the same approximation Potthoff used to determine the loss probabilities of station track groups. In railway operation research scheduled and unscheduled waiting times are differentiated. Scheduled waiting times occur during the process of timetable construction, whenever a train run has to leave his designated slot to avoid a conflict with another train run. Unscheduled waiting times result from knock-on delays during operation. If there is a completely undisturbed operation, unscheduled waiting times will not arise. In these publication the unscheduled waiting times occurring in a route node are deduced by application of a modified loss- / <b>waiting</b> <b>system.</b> Furthermore an enhancement of the Strele formula by Schwanhäußer allows the calculation of scheduled waiting times of route nodes. Additionally this paper contains various sample calculations to illustrate the principles of the described methods...|$|E

40|$|This {{project is}} {{concerned}} with the estimation of the grade of service given to the subscribers in a telephone exchange. The analytical models used are (a) the probability linear graph for lost calls and (b) the traffic flow graph for delayed calls. Both of these models are expressed in terms of the congestion functions of the sub-units of the switching system in the exchange. When these models are used, the engineering procedure of determining the quantity of equipment for the switching system in the exchange to satisfy the objective grade of service is simple. The switching system in the exchange may be divided into three major sub-units: the trunk groups, the switching network, and the common control. The congestion functions for these sub-units are discussed. The structure and the mode of operation for these sub-units are usually very complex, so that the congestion functions for these units can only be approximated. Thus, the overall grade of service estimated this way is only an approximation. Finally, the procedure of estimating the overall grade of service of an exchange is demonstrated by considering a simple hypothetical telephone switching system. The main contributions in this thesis are: (1) The traffic flow graph: This graph is used as the model for estimating the grade of service for delayed calls in an exchange. It can also be used for approximating the waiting time distribution for a given <b>waiting</b> <b>system.</b> (2) The equivalent trunk technique: This technique is shown to be reasonably accurate and simple for use in computing the trunk group congestion distribution when the trunk group is arranged in grading. (3) A method of approximating network blocking probability: This method can be used to approximate the blocking probability of any complex switching network. It is simple and inexpensive and produces reasonably accurate results. (4) Single linking stage network loaded with multitype of traffic: When some types of traffic require the service of more than one link at a time, the network for these types of traffic is blocked even if there are some idle links in the network. Extremely poor approximation will result if the usual assumption of independent busy links is used for calculating the blocking probability. In this thesis, such a network is analysed and a better approximation for computing the blocking probability is given. (5) General case approach for determining waiting time distribution for a single server delay system: Such a single server delay system is analysed. This aids one {{to the understanding of the}} congestion processes producing delays...|$|E

The technique of spawning child processes is used to delegate some work to a child process when {{there is no reason to}} stop the execution of the parent.

40|$|AIM—To compare three {{different}} strategies for determining admission dates for patients awaiting cataract extraction after scoring for visual impairment.  METHODS— 357 patients attending for assessment for cataract surgery were scored for visual impairment. These scores {{were used as}} a basis for ranking patients into three impairment strata. A computer simulation was used to compare 3  years' operation of different admission strategies—a first come first served booking system, a triage booking <b>system,</b> and a <b>waiting</b> list <b>system</b> in which admissions were strictly ordered according to priority stratum. Differences in priority weighted delays before treatment were analysed.  RESULTS—Both the triage system and the priority based <b>waiting</b> list <b>system</b> gave considerable reduction in priority weighted delay compared with a first come first served admission policy. The percentage reduction achieved (30 %- 60 %) is strongly influenced by the number of weeks fully booked when the booking systems are introduced. The priority weighted delay of the triage system, where booking decisions were made {{at the time of the}} outpatient assessment, was consistently and substantially outperformed by the priority based <b>waiting</b> list <b>system</b> where the decision to allocate an admission date was delayed as long as possible.  CONCLUSIONS—There is considerable scope for reducing delays to high priority patients if simple rules are used to determine admission dates. Using these rules, booking patients at the time of the outpatient assessment gives substantially less benefit in terms of reducing delays to high priority patients than if the decision about the admission date is deferred. ...|$|R

For example, over ow traffic in a teletraffic network, or traffic that is bursty in data networks are non-Poissonian. We characterize renewal arrival by a matrix-exponential distribution (one with a rational Laplace transform). Performance measures of interest for the loss system are the call and time blocking, and for the finite <b>waiting</b> room <b>system</b> the call/time blocking and the average waiting time. Using linear algebraic techniques, we present steady-state balance equations and then describe efficient methods to exactly compute both call and time blocking for both the loss system and the nite-waiting room system.
