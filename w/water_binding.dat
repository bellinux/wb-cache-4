5000|$|In cooking, {{eggs are}} multifunctional: they may {{act as an}} {{emulsifier}} to reduce oil/water separation (mayonnaise), a binder (<b>water</b> <b>binding</b> and particle adhesion, as in meatloaf), or an aerator (cakes, especially angel food). Some commercial egg replacers can substitute for particular functions (potato starch and tapioca for <b>water</b> <b>binding,</b> whey protein for aeration or particle binding, or soy lecithin for emulsification). For use on the skin, one-half cup of applesauce can replace one egg in some baking recipes.|$|E

5000|$|The {{consistency}} of a scalded sausage {{depends on the}} <b>water</b> <b>binding</b> capacity of the meat. This is particularly high immediately after slaughter, so that sausages were traditionally made from [...] "still warm, freshly slaughtered" [...] meat. In contemporary times, sausages are mainly produced using chilled or matured meat. In addition, fat stabilization and structure formation (gelation) are crucial factors in cooked sausage.|$|E
50|$|Polish sausages, kiełbasa, {{come in a}} {{wide range}} of styles such as swojska, krajańska, szynkowa (a ham sausage), biała, śląska, krakowska, podhalańska, kishka and others. Sausages in Poland are {{generally}} made of pork, rarely beef. Sausages with low meat content and additions like soy protein, potato flour or <b>water</b> <b>binding</b> additions are regarded as of low quality. Because of climate conditions, sausages were traditionally preserved by smoking, rather than drying, like in Mediterranean countries.|$|E

50|$|L-DOPA is a {{tyrosine}} residue {{that bears}} an additional hydroxyl group. The twin hydroxyl groups in each side-chain compete well with <b>water</b> for <b>binding</b> to surfaces, form polar attachments via hydrogen bonds, and chelate the metals in mineral surfaces.

A number of other neutralising agents are available (pulverised fuel ash-based grouts, cattle manure, whey, brewer's yeast) many which solve a waste disposal problem from another industry.|$|E
5000|$|The {{value of}} each {{individual}} interaction may be small but when {{there are millions of}} interactions the overall force can be noticeable. The presence of water reduces the force of these attractions in three ways. The water puts physical distance between the oil or pan and the proteins {{on the surface of the}} meat. This increases the [...] value in the equation. Water also has a high permittivity value (...) [...] Both of these increase the value of the denominator and reduce the value of the force that is possible. Water is also a polar molecule which means, in certain cases, it can bind to the denatured proteins. <b>Water</b> <b>binding</b> to the proteins on the surface of the meat has no effect on how the meat cooks.|$|E
50|$|Humectants are {{frequently}} used in cosmetics {{as a way}} of increasing and maintaining moisture in the skin and hair, in products including shampoo, conditioner, frizz serum, lotions, creams, lip treatments, cleansers, after-sun lotion, and some soaps or body lotions. As hygroscopic moisturizers, humectants work by attracting water to the upper layer of the skin (stratum corneum). All humectants have common hydroxyl groups which allow them to participate in hydrogen bonding and attract water. This process attracts moisture from the outer layer of the skin or, in high humidity, from the atmosphere. The moisture is then trapped against the epidermis or the shaft of the hair, depending on where the humectant is applied. Various humectants have different ways of behaving because they differ in <b>water</b> <b>binding</b> capacity at different humidities.|$|E

For instance, {{we can use}} this formal construction to omit uninteresting ubiquitously present molecules such as <b>water</b> by <b>binding</b> the graph of the water molecule to the transformation rule of a reaction that requires water. Similarly, graph unbinding {{can be defined as}} a transformation rule that destroys graphs.

Available water is necessary for the microbial and enzymatic reactions involved in spoilage. There are a number of techniques that have been or are used to tie up the available water or remove it by reducing the aw. Traditionally, techniques such as drying, salting and smoking have been used, and have been used for thousands of years.

50|$|Starch {{gelatinization}} is {{the most}} important feature in instant noodles that can enhance water retention during cooking. Two key steps in instant noodle processing serve the function to trigger starch gelatinization, which are steaming and oil-frying. Starch gelatinization occurs when starch granules swell in water with heat, amyloses leak out of starch granules, which could bind to water and increase the viscosity of gluten matrix. Steaming offers an optimal condition for the gelatinization of potato starches. After steaming, rapid oil-frying vaporize the free water, and gelatinization continues until all the free water is dehydrated. During frying, water in noodle strands migrates from central region outwards to replace the surface water that is dehydrated during frying. Therefore, a porous sponge structure in the noodle is created due to vaporization. During the migration of water, it carries thermal energy from oil to the surroundings and bound water to offer the heat for finishing starch gelatinization. Furthermore, the heat transfer during evaporation protects instant noodles from burning or being overcooked during frying. Moreover, as a common additive, guar gum can not only increases the elasticity and viscosity of noodles to enhance the mouth feel, it can also increase the <b>water</b> <b>binding</b> ability of noodles when cooking in boiling water. Hydrocolloids could bind large amounts of water; the more water they bind, the faster heat will transfer to the center of noodles.|$|E

5000|$|Other {{reactions}} {{may take}} place via GS. Competition between ammonium ion and <b>water,</b> their <b>binding</b> affinities, and {{the concentration of}} ammonium ion, influences glutamine synthesis and glutamine hydrolysis. Glutamine is formed if an ammonium ion attacks the acyl-phosphate intermediate, while glutamate is remade if water attacks the intermediate. [...] Ammonium ion binds more strongly than water to GS due to electrostatic forces between a cation and a negatively charged pocket. Another possible reaction is upon NH2OH binding to GS, rather than NH4+, yields γ-glutamylhydroxamate.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} process {{parameters}} on the <b>water</b> <b>binding</b> capacity of isolated proteins from lupins (L. albus cv. Amiga) have been studied. The {{results show that}} the <b>water</b> <b>binding</b> capacity can be tailored in the range from 2 to about 5 g g- 1 by process control. Native proteins from lupins are characterized by their high resolvability in water (about 65 - 85 g 100 g- 1) and low <b>water</b> <b>binding</b> capacity (< 2 g g- 1). A comparison of the property profiles of commercial isolated proteins from various sources having similar resolvability and similar <b>water</b> <b>binding</b> capacity indicates that other product properties such as emulsifying capacity and oil binding capacity can show large differences. The purposeful selection of a custom-designed protein for a specific application is made easier by using comprehensive property profiles.

40|$|Incorporating {{high volume}} {{fractions}} of broccoli powder in starch noodle dough {{has a major}} effect on its shear modulus, {{as a result of}} significant swelling of the broccoli particles. Several hydrocolloids with distinct <b>water</b> <b>binding</b> capacity (locust bean gum (LBG), guar gum, konjac glucomannan (KG), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and xanthan gum), were added to systems with 4 and 20 % (v/v dry based) broccoli particles, and the effect of this addition on dough rheology, mechanical properties and structure of cooked noodles was investigated. Hydrocolloids with low (LBG and guar gum) and intermediate (KG) <b>water</b> <b>binding</b> capacity had no significant effect on shear rheology of the dough. Adding hydrocolloids with high <b>water</b> <b>binding</b> capacity (HPMC and xanthan gum) decreased the shear modulus of dough with 20 % broccoli particles significantly. CLSM analysis of cooked noodles showed that in samples containing xanthan gum there was also an inhibition of swelling of starch granules. Strength and stiffness of cooked noodles with 20 % broccoli particles were higher for samples containing xanthan gum, than samples without xanthan gum. The cooking loss and swelling index of samples with added hydrocolloids were slightly lower than samples without hydrocolloids. Our results showed that hydrocolloids with high <b>water</b> <b>binding</b> capacity can be used to control the degree of swelling of vegetable particles and starch granules in starch noodle products, and thereby control both dough rheology and textural properties of the cooked noodle...|$|E
