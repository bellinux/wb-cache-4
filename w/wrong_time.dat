5|$|Written by Pennant Roberts, this four-part {{story was}} {{commissioned}} on 10 January 1979 as Dragons of Fear. The adventure would involve the planet Erinella {{and two men}} fighting over a princess. The Doctor would become involved in his own timeline by arriving at the <b>wrong</b> <b>time</b> and becoming {{accused of being a}} poisoner. Roberts resubmitted the story in the mid-1980s to script editor Eric Saward, but nothing came of the submission.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Fingleton {{made what}} turned out to be his {{international}} farewell as Australia toured England, a series in which he found runs difficult to come by. He later attributed this to his inability to play the pull shot. However, Fingleton started the tour well. He passed 30 in each of his first seven innings on English soil, and converted three of these starts into centuries, scoring 124 against Oxford University, 111 against Cambridge University and 123 not out against Hampshire in the first month of cricket. Fingleton's form tapered just at the <b>wrong</b> <b>time,</b> falling three times for single figures in the last two matches before the Tests. He carried this into the First Test at Trent Bridge, where he made only 9 and 40 in a high-scoring draw in which every innings passed 400.|$|E
5|$|In August, she steamed to New York for repairs, {{arriving}} at Base 10 on 19 August and entering the New York Navy Yard soon thereafter. She completed repairs on 26 September and got underway for Port Jefferson that same day. During the mid-watch on 27 September, she ran hard aground on Block Island. Captain Victor Blue and his navigator, confused about shore lights and {{more concerned about}} the minefield at the opening of Long Island Sound, made the turn at the <b>wrong</b> <b>time</b> and ran the ship aground on the island from the bow all the way aft beyond midships. For three days, her crew lightened ship to no avail. On 30 September, tugs came to her assistance, and she finally backed clear. Hull damage dictated a return to the yard, and extensive repairs precluded her departure with Battleship Division 9 (BatDiv 9) for the British Isles in November. The secondary battery was reduced to eighteen 5-inch guns in October 1917. Captain Blue, a protege of Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels, was never court-martialed and remained in command of Texas. The Navy Department held his navigator entirely responsible for the accident.|$|E

50|$|For {{sleeping}} at inappropriate {{places at the}} <b>wrong</b> <b>times,</b> Baron was made {{to sleep on the}} long bench and he had to be carried around by his brother. When he was caught sleeping on a chair, he was then made to sleep on a bamboo bed, but he had to carry it wherever he goes.|$|R
5|$|Chulip is an adventure/simulation game {{in which}} the player must improve the hero's {{reputation}} {{in the community of}} Long Life Town by kissing its various citizens. The player's health is represented by a number of hearts. To gain more hearts the player has to find and kiss other characters in the game. Finding out how and when to kiss other characters is a puzzle in of itself. The game and each of its non-player characters (NPCs) follow a 24-hour day schedule. In the daytime, many of the NPCs of the game are walking around the streets. To succeed in kissing an NPC, the player is required to wait for the correct time where they will be happy and press the corresponding button. The player must sometimes complete a certain task for that NPC. Choosing the <b>wrong</b> <b>time</b> to kiss will often result in the player getting hit and losing health. Exploring Long Life Town presents the player with numerous environmental hazards discovered by trial and error. For instance, attempting to use the town's playground equipment or being suddenly shot at by the night-patrolling policeman will cause instant death. One mission ends in the player being struck by lightning, removing more than ten hearts and resulting in a game over if the player does not have sufficient health.|$|E

50|$|Mullins was a {{representative}} of City Firsts and New South Wales, though injuries suffered at the <b>wrong</b> <b>times</b> during his career prevented him from representing his country. In a trial for World Cup selection in 1971, Mullins suffered a broken jaw and again, in 1973 when he was 'king hit' {{in a game against}} Manly-Warringah costing him any chance of being selected to the 1973 Kangaroo tour.|$|R

40|$|The {{record of}} aid to fragile and poorly-performing states is the real test of aid effectiveness. Rich {{countries}} can justify aid to fragile states both through altruism and self-interest.

50|$|The {{results of}} {{qualifying}} were later amended after a transponder error recorded the <b>wrong</b> <b>times</b> for Tarquini and Oriola in Q2. Tarquini moved up {{one place to}} 5th while Oriola moved up from 12th to 6th. Thompson dropped two places to seventh while Huff, Marc Basseng, James Nash and Coronel each dropped one place. This put Nash on pole position for race two. An engine change for Monje sent the Campos Racing driver {{to the back of}} the grid for race one.|$|R
25|$|According to Susan Sontag, leukemia {{was often}} romanticized in 20th-century fiction, {{portrayed as a}} joy-ending, clean disease whose fair, {{innocent}} and gentle victims die young or at the <b>wrong</b> <b>time.</b> As such, it was the cultural successor to tuberculosis, which held this cultural position until it was discovered to be an infectious disease. The 1970 romance novel Love Story {{is an example of}} this romanticization of leukemia.|$|E
25|$|His final preoccupation is {{over the}} precise date of Easter, which he writes about at length. It is here, and only here, that he ventures some {{criticism}} of St Cuthbert and the Irish missionaries, who celebrated the event, according to Bede, at the <b>wrong</b> <b>time.</b> In the end he is pleased {{to note that the}} Irish Church was saved from error by accepting the correct date for Easter.|$|E
25|$|Ewell's {{failure to}} take Culp's Hill or Cemetery Hill that evening is {{considered}} one of the great missed opportunities of the battle. Another reason for his reluctance to proceed was intelligence that Union troops were approaching from the east on the Hanover Road. This was the vanguard of the XII Corps under Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum. If those troops had arrived at the <b>wrong</b> <b>time,</b> Ewell's flank would have been turned.|$|E
50|$|That evening, purely by coincidence, Tully accompanies {{his other}} neighbor, John Ayres, {{to the club}} at which Maggie {{performs}} as a singer/dancer (The Little Bit of Fluff), his wife and MIL having left town to visit aunty. It is at this club that Tully accidentally acquires the necklace and so, {{the rest of the}} farce is taken up with scenes of mistaken identities, moments of being in the wrong places at the <b>wrong</b> <b>times,</b> misunderstandings with wives, stepmothers, and boxer boyfriends, etc.|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to the four species responsible for {{a significant number of}} fatal attacks on humans, a number of other species have attacked humans without being provoked, and have on extremely rare occasions been responsible for a human death. This group includes the shortfin mako, hammerhead, Galapagos, gray reef, blacktip, lemon, silky shark and blue sharks. These sharks are also large, powerful predators which can be provoked simply by being in the water at the <b>wrong</b> <b>time</b> and place, but they are normally considered less dangerous to humans than the previous group.|$|E
25|$|Acupuncture needles {{during this}} period were much thicker than most modern ones and often {{resulted}} in infection. Infection {{is caused by a}} lack of sterilization, but at that time it was believed to be caused by use of the wrong needle, or needling in the wrong place, or at the <b>wrong</b> <b>time.</b> Later, many needles were heated in boiling water, or in a flame. Sometimes needles were used while they were still hot, creating a cauterizing effect at the injection site. Nine needles were recommended in the Chen Chiu Ta Chheng from 1601, which may have been because of an ancient Chinese belief that nine was a magic number.|$|E
25|$|The NTP packet {{includes}} a leap second flag, which informs the user that a leap second is imminent. This, among other things, allows {{the user to}} distinguish between a bad measurement that should be ignored and a genuine leap second that should be followed. It {{has been reported that}} never, since the monitoring began in 2008 and whether or not a leap second should be inserted, have all NTP servers correctly set their flags on a December 31 or June 30. This is one reason many NTP servers broadcast the <b>wrong</b> <b>time</b> for up to a day after a leap second insertion, and {{it has been suggested that}} hackers have exploited this vulnerability.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the rhythmic}} accent pattern drives the movement, Ligeti deletes beats from certain {{measures}} {{in order to}} [...] "restart" [...] the pattern in sections in which the left hand restatement of the theme is offset from the right. Ligeti further reinforces the folk-dance origins of the movement by using {{a great deal of}} open fifths in the accompaniment that correspond to the open strings on a fiddle or cello. In fact, the many metric [...] "skips" [...] and rhythmic offsets may be referring to folk musicians who accidentally enter at the <b>wrong</b> <b>times.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Druidic temple: A conical stone {{structure}} {{just east}} of the road south of the reservoir was said to be a site where local Druids practiced their rituals, and horrible things might come to pass for any intruder who looked too closely or came at the <b>wrong</b> <b>time.</b> The building is actually an iron smelter left over from the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 when the United States was forced into creating an economic independence to complement its political freedom. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Clinton Furnace in 1976. It is currently fenced off by the Newark water department to prevent any entrance and the liability for injury that might result.|$|E
25|$|The United States Department of Defense removed {{seventeen}} {{soldiers and}} officers from duty, and eleven soldiers {{were charged with}} dereliction of duty, maltreatment, aggravated assault and battery. Between May 2004 and March 2006, these soldiers were convicted in courts-martial, sentenced to military prison, and dishonorably discharged from service. Two soldiers, Specialist Charles Graner and PFC Lynndie England, were sentenced to ten and three years in prison, respectively. Brigadier General Janis Karpinski, the commanding officer of all detention facilities in Iraq, was reprimanded and demoted {{to the rank of}} colonel. Several more military personnel who were accused of perpetrating or authorizing the measures, including many of higher rank, were not prosecuted. It is reported that most inmates were innocent of the crimes they were accused of and were simply detained due to them being {{in the wrong place at}} the <b>wrong</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cooperation was {{hindered}} by Fighter Command retaining rigid {{control of its}} units. The Admiralty complained that RAF methods did not permit direct contact by RAF operational staff liaising with the naval command. Time was lost and the fluidity of aerial warfare, meant that RAF aircraft came into action at the <b>wrong</b> <b>time</b> or place, often in numbers too small to defend the evacuation ships. Vice Admiral Max Horton the Commander-in-Chief Dover, responsible for organising the evacuation (Operation Dynamo), asked to meet Dowding in late June, to prevent the operational difficulties occurring again. Horton was told to put his complaints on paper {{and send them to}} Dowding, with a copy to the Air Ministry and they never met. It was felt by the Admiralty that the RAF was fighting a separate war, with little consideration given to joint operations.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. As {{wearable}} computing {{becomes more}} mainstream, it holds {{the promise of}} delivering timely, relevant notifications to the user. How-ever, these devices can potentially inundate the user, distracting them at the <b>wrong</b> <b>times</b> and providing the wrong amount of information. As physiological sensing also becomes consumer-grade, it holds the promise of helping to control these notifications. To solve this, we build a system Phylter that uses physiological sensing to modulate notifications to the user. Phylter receives streaming data about a user’s cognitive state, and uses this to modulate whether the user should receive the information. We discuss {{the components of the}} system and how they interact...|$|R
