5|$|<b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> a {{collective}} feeling like we'd {{had enough of}} this kind of shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E
25|$|His next album, <b>We</b> <b>All</b> <b>Had</b> Doctors' Papers, {{was another}} live album, {{recorded}} {{this time at}} Pontarddulais Rugby Club. This was released in late 1975 and, unexpectedly, it reached the #1 position on the UK Albums Chart for the week ending 15 November. This recording has {{the distinction of being}} the only comedy album to ever top the UK Albums Chart. Boyce released several albums over the next few years, receiving further gold discs for The Incredible Plan in 1976, and I Know 'Cos I Was There in 1978.|$|E
25|$|As Boyce's {{popularity}} became established throughout Wales and the United Kingdom, {{he became}} involved in many side projects, including three books, several television series and televised concerts, and three multi-part television specials produced by Opix Films. His spoken and sung poetry was first collected in Max Boyce: His Songs and Poems in 1976, with an introduction by Barry John. The comic illustrations that accompany the poems were drawn by his friend Gren Jones of the South Wales Echo (who had also illustrated the cover of <b>We</b> <b>All</b> <b>Had</b> Doctors' Papers). This publication was followed up with a similar collection, I Was There!, in 1980.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} Pearl Jam's legacy in a 2000 interview, Vedder said, [...] "I think {{at some point}} along the way we began feeling we wanted to give people {{something}} to believe in because <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> bands that gave that to us when we needed something to believe in. That was the big challenge for us after the first record and the response to it. The goal immediately became how do we continue to be musicians and grow and survive in view of all this...

500|$|For {{the scenes}} {{involving}} self-defense courses, the supporting cast underwent stunt training {{with the help}} of stunt coordinator Sean Graham. Ron wears a back support belt during the course, which was actor Nick Offerman's idea. Offerman has many fight choreography skills from his past work in the Chicago theater, and he combined those skills with his training in Kabuki dance and theater. Offerman said, [...] "I threw in a couple of Kabuki moves that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> a hard time keeping a straight face through." [...] It was a reference to the episode [...] "The Stakeout", in which Ron suffered a hernia, and Muharrar said, [...] "The idea [...] that Ron has the belt in his car trunk and is ready to go at a moment's notice." ...|$|E
500|$|Aside from touring, Korn also {{released}} three singles {{following the}} album's release. [...] "No Place to Hide" [...] was the album's first single.

Retrieved 2010-02-20. The song [...] "A.D.I.D.A.S." [...] was released as a single on March 4, 1997. The song's music video was directed by Joseph Kahn. Reginald [...] "Fieldy" [...] Arvizu said that [...] "It {{was one of the}} hardest videos we ever made because <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> to lie still on cold metal slabs for hours, pretending to be dead.

That he must first look to the lawfulness of the act itself, and then he must not have so little regard of Innocents that he spare not friends and necessary persons for the Commonwealth." [...] When Catesby offered to tell the priest more, Garnet declined: [...] "I told him what charge <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> of quietness and to procure the like in others." [...] Garnet also spoke with William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, asking him [...] "if Catholics {{were able to make}} their part good by arms against the King", but Monteagle's reply was vague. [...] Author Alan Haynes suggests that Garnet may at that point have become marginalised.|$|E

Monáe completed the album in Atlanta at the Wondaland Studios and the famous asylum The Palace of the Dogs. Monáe has stated that the album signifies [...] "breaking the chains that enslave minorities of all types". She has said of recording the album, [...] "Overall, this music came from various corners of the world—from Turkey to Prague to Atlanta—places we were on tour. While recording, we’d experiment with different sounds. Once we became engulfed in the sound, <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> an emotional connection to the album. It has definitely transformed my way of thinking, the way that I approach the stage and overall, my life".|$|E
500|$|Kate Elizabeth Winslet {{was born}} on 5 October 1975 in Reading, Berkshire, England, to Sally Anne (née Bridges) and Roger John Winslet. Her mother worked as a nanny and waitress, and her father, a {{struggling}} actor, took labouring jobs to support the family. Her maternal grandparents were both actors and ran the Reading Repertory Theatre Company. Winslet has two sisters, Anna and Beth, {{both of whom are}} actresses, and a younger brother, Joss. The family had limited financial means; they lived on free meal benefits and were supported by a charity named the Actor's Charitable Trust. When Winslet was 10, her father nearly lost his foot in a boating accident and found it harder to find work, leading to more financial hardships for the family. Even so, Winslet has said, [...] "We never felt like the poor kids, which is absolutely a credit to my parents. We lived in a lovely terrace house and <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> each other." ...|$|E
500|$|The band's follow-up, Even If It Kills Me (2007), was {{recorded}} in New York City with Eli Janney and Adam Schlesinger of Fountains of Wayne, and Ric Ocasek of the Cars. The group, though big fans of his work, were disappointed with Ocasek's role. [...] "He just confused me the whole time," [...] said Pierre later, who noted that {{he was afraid to}} disclose that the experience was a [...] "bum-out." [...] Pierre struggled with writer's block during the sessions and found himself writing lyrics while recording the songs, which he had never done before. The band was also worried their songs would not be catchy enough after their last album was so successful. During this time, Pierre's substance abuse nearly disbanded the group. [...] "I think it's an understatement to say it is tough to be tied to Justin's emotions," [...] Cain later remarked. Following completion of the album, Pierre entered a three-week rehabilitation program for alcohol and drug abuse. The band was apart for a six-week stretch in the summer of 2007, marking their longest break apart in five years. [...] "It might sound cliched, but <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> a chance to do some growing up," [...] said Cain.|$|E

500|$|The group {{moved to}} Macon, Georgia by May 1, where Walden was {{establishing}} Capricorn Records. The band performed locally, {{as well as}} eighty miles north in Atlanta's Piedmont Park, and practiced at the newly minted Capricorn nearly each day. The group forged a strong brotherhood, spending countless hours rehearsing, consuming psychedelic drugs, and hanging out in Rose Hill Cemetery, where they would write songs. Their first performances outside the South came on May 30 and 31 in Boston, opening for the Velvet Underground. In need of more material, the group remade old blues numbers like “Trouble No More” and “One Way Out”, in addition to improvised jams such as “Mountain Jam.” Gregg, who had struggled to write in the past, became the band’s sole songwriter, composing songs such as “Whipping Post" [...] and “Black-Hearted Woman.” Much of the material collected on The Allman Brothers Band was written between the period of May to August 1969 and premiered live. According to Johanson, the group gauged crowd reaction to the numbers and adjusted the songs accordingly. [...] "Before {{we went into the}} studio, we had a very clear idea of what we were all trying to do musically and that it was unique, totally different from anything else that anyone was playing," [...] said Betts. [...] "From the earliest rehearsals, <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> the same mind-set." ...|$|E
500|$|The user {{interface}} design (UI) for The Last of Us underwent various different iterations throughout development. User interface designer Alexandria Neonakis {{originally intended to}} integrate the weapon upgrade system into the weapon slotting system, in order to constantly remind players to upgrade their weapons. Upon further iterations, Neonakis discovered that this integration resulted in a cluttered interface. Ultimately, {{it was decided that}} the upgrade system would be integrated in the form of upgrade benches, occasionally found throughout the game's world; this also solved another problem that Neonakis witnessed, in which players would upgrade to the lowest possible option, as opposed to saving parts for the higher options. Once it was decided to split the upgrade and slotting systems, the initial design was to select the weapons from a circle. This design, eventually considered [...] "clunky and slow", was replaced in preference of a list system. Neonakis has identified that the main problem with the list design was that it forced players to focus on navigating through menus during intense combat. This led to the final design, which allows players to swap and slot weapons in the same menu. To integrate the UI into the game, Neonakis separated the individual elements and changed their format. User interface programmer Paul Burg provided Neonakis with tools to move elements using their coordinates. All animated transitions were hard coded, which led to difficulty in creating smooth transitions. [...] "This was tedious and at times incredibly frustrating, but it also meant that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> to be pretty creative in how things were designed," [...] Neonakis said. The game's crafting system was implemented into immediate gameplay, in order for players to feel involved. [...] "We needed to make it streamlined and fast enough that you felt like you could take just that moment and be able to craft that thing that's going to mean your survival in the next thirty seconds, or your failure to survive," [...] lead game designer Jacob Minkoff said.|$|E
