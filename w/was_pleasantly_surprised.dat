500|$|James {{signed with}} the National Football League's (NFL) Detroit Lions in 1947.

Detroit did not renew his contract, and the Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), a team coached by Paul Brown, picked him up. He started at right defensive halfback in 1948 opposite Tommy Colella and intercepted four passes as the Browns went 15–0 and won the All-America Football Conference championship.

Salonga's agent then scheduled her audition, at which she performed [...] "Part of Your World" [...] from The Little Mermaid. Salonga finally began recording a demo of [...] "A Whole New World" [...] a few days later. With the casting of Salonga, Larkin became one of Disney's first voice actors to not provide the singing voice of the character she voices, and thus Jasmine {{marked the first time}} Disney decided to separate a character's speaking and singing voices.

Lee recalled in 2009, [...] "Honestly, there was so much genuine talent around that table that you could have cut it with a knife." [...] Afterward, Lee met the writers of the show, and <b>was</b> <b>pleasantly</b> <b>surprised</b> to find that they were familiar with his work and he was with theirs. Afterward, executive producer Al Jean took Lee out to lunch, who he called [...] "one of the nicest and most unassuming guys you could hope to meet." [...] Lee continued, [...] "Of course, I probably said something wrong to him, or he didn't like my table manners, because I haven't been invited back for another guest shot. But hey one lives in hope." [...] The voice actor who plays Angry Dad in the episode was portrayed by Dan Castellaneta, who also does the voice for Homer among other characters in the series.

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five, comparing it to [...] "Demons", an episode of The X-Files which was broadcast during the same season. Shearman and Pearson found [...] "Walkabout" [...] the better episode of the two, but felt that it became [...] "a curiously passionate affair" [...] after the first act—from the cold open until Black is found by the police. Shearman also noted that Željko Ivanek's guest performance [...] "lacked subtlety", though praised Henriksen for a [...] "bravura performance. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated [...] "Walkabout" [...] 4 out of 5, describing it as [...] "a fine outing". Gibron felt that the episode [...] "forces us to confront uneasy questions", likening the narrative to [...] "a giant puzzle with the pieces tossed at us from all angles". Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, rated [...] "Walkabout" [...] an A−. Handlen noted that he <b>was</b> <b>pleasantly</b> <b>surprised</b> that the episode did not play on clichéd amnesia tropes as he had expected, and felt that involving Black so heavily in the cold open was a good method of changing the series' usual formula.|$|E
500|$|Jack Garner of the Democrat and Chronicle {{gave the}} film {{a rating of}} 8 out of 10, {{concluding}} that he <b>was</b> <b>pleasantly</b> <b>surprised</b> at the documentary's entertainment value. He described it as educational, despite Fucks repetitive use of the word. In The Boston Globe Wesley Morris commented that the director's flippant style was beneficial, enabling him to make serious educational points to the audience. Sally Foster of Film Threat said that {{the crux of the}} film was the debate about freedom of speech, and that the film was funny and thought-provoking. A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times: [...] "Mr. Anderson's movie is staged as a talking-head culture-war skirmish between embattled upholders of propriety (or repression, if you prefer) and proponents of free expression (or filth), but its real lesson is that the two sides depend upon each other. Or rather, that the continued vitality of the word—its unique ability to convey emphasis, relieve stress, shock grown-ups and function as adverb, noun, verb, intensifier and what linguists call 'infix'—rests on its ability to mark an edge between the permissible and the profane". In the Chicago Reader, Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that the documentary was an amusing film and an educational commentary on the word. According to Glenn Garvin of The Miami Herald, the film was an expansive merging of perspectives from politics, history and culture.|$|E

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated, [...] "2001 isn't as consistent or striking as Slim Shady, {{but the music}} is always brimming with character." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Tom Sinclair praised the production, calling it [...] "uncharacteristically sparse sound" [...] from Dr. Dre {{and that it was}} as [...] "addictive as it was back when over 3million record buyers got hooked on The Chronic and Snoop Dogg's Dre-produced Doggystyle" [...] and went on to commend Dr. Dre, stating, [...] "If any rap producer deserves the title [...] "composer", it's he." [...] NME mentioned that Dr. Dre didn't expand the genre, but it was [...] "powerful enough in parts, but not clever enough to give Will Smith the fear". PopMatters writer Chris Massey declared that [...] "Musically, 2001 is about as close to brilliant as any one gangsta rap album might possibly get." [...] Christopher John Farley of Time stated that [...] "The beats are fresh and involving, and Dre's collaborations with Eminem and Snoop Dogg have ferocity and wit." [...] Although he was ambivalent towards the album's subject matter and guest rappers, Greg Tate of Spin <b>was</b> <b>pleasantly</b> <b>surprised</b> by [...] "the most memorable MC'ing on this album com from Dre himself, Eminem notwithstanding" [...] and stated, [...] "Whatever one's opinion of the sexual politics and gun lust of Dre's canon, his ongoing commitment to formal excellence and sonic innovation in this art form may one day earn him a place next to George Clinton, if not Stevie Wonder, Duke Ellington, or Miles Davis." ...|$|E
