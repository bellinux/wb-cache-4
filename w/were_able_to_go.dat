5|$|Santoso married again, {{this time}} to Indonesian Socialist Party figure Soebadio Sastrosatomo, on 10 January 1964. The couple were often {{separated}} when Sastrasatomo was imprisoned for his political activities, but they <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on the hajj together. During the 1960s Santoso continued to be politically active, serving in the State Secretariat from 1962 to 1967 and on the State Advisory Council from 1967 to 1972. While with Sastrosatomo, she adopted a child.|$|E
5|$|The new format {{meant that}} all cars {{took to the}} track quickly in Q1, with {{everyone}} setting lap times on the super-soft compound, the fastest tyre available at the event. The two Manor drivers were first to be eliminated, having set only one timed lap each, as were both Haas cars after them, being unable to cross the finishing line in time. The same fate caught out Daniil Kvyat, who qualified 18th. Both Sauber drivers <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out on a second timed lap, but proved too slow to avoid being the last {{to go out in}} Q1, after Renault rookie Jolyon Palmer was able to avoid elimination, setting a faster time {{towards the end of the}} session.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Salamis {{marked the}} {{turning point in the}} Greco-Persian wars. After Salamis, the Peloponnese, and by {{extension}} Greece as an entity, was safe from conquest; and the Persians suffered a major blow to their prestige and morale (as well as severe material losses). At the following battles of Plataea and Mycale, the threat of conquest was removed, and the Allies <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on the counter-offensive. The Greek victory allowed Macedon to revolt against Persian rule; and over the next 30 years, Thrace, the Aegean Islands and finally Ionia would be removed from Persian control by the Allies, or by the Athenian-dominated successor, the Delian League. Salamis started a decisive swing in the balance of power toward the Greeks, which would culminate in an eventual Greek victory, severely reducing Persian power in the Aegean.|$|E

500|$|The English were {{becalmed}} in {{port and}} unable to manoeuvre. On [...] 1545, the French galleys advanced on the immobilised English fleet, and initially threatened to destroy a force of 13 small galleys, or [...] "rowbarges", the only ships that were able to move against them without a wind. The wind picked up and the sailing ships <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on the offensive before the oared vessels were overwhelmed. Two of the largest ships, the Henry Grace à Dieu and the Mary Rose, led {{the attack on the}} French galleys in the Solent.|$|E
500|$|The script served its diversionary purpose, and the Coens put it aside: [...] "Barton Fink sort of {{washed out}} our brain and we <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back and finish Miller's Crossing." [...] Once {{production}} of the first movie was finished, the Coens began to recruit staff to film Barton Fink. Turturro looked forward to playing the lead role, and spent a month with the Coens in Los Angeles to coordinate views on the project: [...] "I felt I could bring something more human to Barton. Joel and Ethan allowed me a certain contribution. I tried {{to go a little}} further than they expected." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have suggested that}} the practice is based on Biblical commentator Nahmanides's (1194–1270) interpretation of the scriptural verse [...] "And all those that were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers' houses, from twenty years old and upward, all that <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> forth to war in Israel" [...] (...) [...] In his commentary on the Torah (the Five Books of Moses), Nahmanides contends that Moses asked each Jew to come before him to be counted. This personal appearance of the Jew before Moses, the tzadik (Jewish holy man), foreshadowed the ceremony of the giving of a kvitel by the Hasid to his Rebbe.|$|E

500|$|The {{process of}} putting {{together}} All the Way... A Decade of Song was laborious for all involved, from balancing {{the number of}} hits and new songs to ensuring {{that each of the}} latest tracks showed a new side of Dion. [...] "We had hourly conversations, back and forth, about what the combination should be," [...] said John Doelp, the album's co-executive producer. [...] "We wanted to make sure we had some new sounds and that we <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to new places." [...] Co-executive producer Vito Luprano added: [...] "The first idea was to record three new songs, then Dion said, 'Let's go for five,' her lucky number. But we had so many great songs coming in that we ended up recording nine. Out of that, we decided to go with seven." ...|$|E

500|$|In New Mexico, they {{obtained}} false identification, {{and purchased}} several pistols. Their {{intention was to}} purchase guns which were difficult to trace. Caldwell said {{it was easy to}} obtain guns in New Mexico: [...] "we found it was pretty easy to buy guns. All {{you had to do was}} show some identification and it was easy to get." [...] Caldwell said she and Stork went to a university library to find the identity [...] "of someone dying very young", next went [...] "to public records and asked for a copy of a birth certificate" [...] and described how [...] "we got a rent receipt book and just made up a rent receipt". [...] "And then we <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to several different gun shops in Albuquerque with those two bits of identification and buy five different guns and bullets," [...] said Caldwell. They were able to obtain one Colt [...]38-caliber revolver, and four Ruger [...]357-caliber Security-Six Magnum revolvers. The conspirators smuggled the guns into Oregon by packing them in luggage and putting the luggage on a Greyhound Lines bus. Caldwell said that she and Stork traveled by bus back to the Rajneesh commune so as to avoid airport metal detectors.|$|E

500|$|In 1588, {{the first}} missionaries from the Society of Jesus arrived in Asunción at the {{invitation}} of the settlers and the governor. [...] They set to work at converting the Indians in the area. [...] They also built a prominent church and college; the college was the only educational institution of any importance in the province. [...] The Jesuits gathered a large number of Indians under their care, where they <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> about Christianizing them and introducing the Indians to elements of Spanish civilization. [...] Most importantly, the Jesuits were able to offer Indians under their care a measure of protection against other whites. [...] Indians on their mission would not be sold into slavery, tricked out of their goods, or have their women taken for extra wives. [...] Over time, an entire [...] "empire within an empire" [...] was built up, and the Jesuits took on responsibilities far beyond religious education. [...] In order to pay royal taxes for the Indians, the Jesuits ran an economy and sold goods at market. [...] In order to defend against Portuguese slavers and hostile Indians, the Jesuits gathered armaments and trained in the arts of war. [...] This arming was highly controversial and was opposed by the Paraguayan settlers, but the constant threat of Portuguese invasion meant the Spanish Crown gave its consent.|$|E
500|$|On December 20, 2014, {{the album}} was made {{available}} for pre-order at the iTunes Store. When ordered, six tracks (five in the United Kingdom) were automatically downloaded. Madonna stated that the songs {{were meant to be}} [...] "an early Christmas gift" [...] with the final release on March 10, 2015. Originally, [...] "Living for Love" [...] was intended to serve as the lead single from the album. It was to be released on Valentine's Day, {{with the rest of the}} record slated for the spring. However, due to the leak, the release date had to be pushed up. Oseary recalled that they did not receive a confirmation until Friday night whether the pre-release could be executed, since iTunes was closing for the Christmas weekend. After much discussion on the pros and cons of the release, and with the aid of Interscope vice-chairman Steve Berman, and Apple Inc.'s Robert Kondrk, they <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> live slowly. The six songs Madonna chose had to be polished, and since the tracks' producers were unavailable, she mastered and mixed them herself. The album's release was compared to Beyoncé's self-titled surprise release in 2013, with The Guardian calling it a [...] "partial Beyoncé". The leaks continued with fourteen new demos being revealed between December 23 and December 27. Three new tracks—"Hold Tight", [...] "Joan of Arc" [...] and [...] "Iconic"—became available following Madonna's Grammy performance.|$|E
