5|$|The players {{acquired}} by Fletcher matured {{into one of}} the strongest teams in the league during the mid-1980s and early 1990s. From 1984–85 to 1990–91, the Flames tallied 90 points in every season but one. However, they were usually unable to transform that success into a deep playoff run, largely because they could not get the better of their provincial rivals, the powerhouse Oilers. Although the Oilers and Flames usually finished at or {{near the top of the}} Campbell Conference, the NHL's playoff structure of the time made it very likely that the Flames would meet the Oilers in either the first or second round, rather than in Campbell Conference finals. That same structure made it very likely that the other two playoff qualifiers in the Smythe Division <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> past the Flames or Oilers (or both) in order to make it to the conference finals. From 1983 until 1990, either the Oilers or the Flames represented the Campbell Conference in the Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E
25|$|Lee did get one wicket, though, and Australia {{could have}} been forgiven for {{thinking}} {{it was the most}} important. Pietersen pulled to Simon Katich for 71, off just 76 balls, and with the score on 342 for 7, England <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> something extraordinary out of the tail to get past 400. But they did – Steve Harmison smacked two fours and a six in an entertaining, if brief, 17, and Simon Jones stuck around with Matthew Hoggard for a vital last-wicket partnership of 32, Jones making 19 not out. Shane Warne finally got the better of Hoggard, but England had made 407, in just under 80 overs. The Australian openers took to the field for the last half-hour of the day. However, heavy rain prevented another ball being bowled on the first day.|$|E
25|$|Wilson wanted Robertson reduced “from the {{position}} of a Master to that of a servant”. Robertson thought Wilson's SWC Joint Note 12, which predicted that neither side could win a decisive victory on the Western Front in 1918, and that decisive results could be had against Turkey, “d-----d rot in general” and promised Haig he would “stick to (his) guns and clear out if (he was) overruled”. Joint Note 12 and Note 14 proposing the formation of a General Reserve were discussed at the second full session of the SWC (30 January – 2 February 1918): Robertson opposed attacks on Turkey, (1 Feb) siding openly with Clemenceau against Lloyd George. Although Robertson apologised for doing so, the Prime Minister was angry and told Wilson afterwards that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of Robertson. Robertson's request to be on the Executive Board controlling the planned Allied General Reserve was overruled.|$|E

25|$|On 23 December 2009 PSV Eindhoven {{decided to}} loan out Reimond Manco until June to Peruvian club Juan Aurich. Juan Aurich {{had the chance}} to play the Copa Libertadores, the {{equivalent}} of the UEFA Champions League in South America, which would give Manco some high-calibre matches, but first they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> through the first round against Mexican side Estudiantes Tecos. In Juan Aurich's only pre-season friendly Manco came on in the 32nd minute for injured winger William Chiroque. The first leg of the Copa Libertadores tie was in Juan Aurich's homeground, Chiclayo, where the Peruvians won 2–0 in a dominating game where Manco showcased his great skill and destroyed the struggling Mexican team's defense. Estudiantes Tecos, on a five-game losing streak, firmly believed they could win it at home and qualify to the second round, setting up the first goal on the 43rd minute, after beating two defenders on the right flank and crossing perfectly to Luis Tejeda's head, who had also scored the two goals in Peru. Defender Wily Rivas received a red card in the 64th minute and Estudiantes began to press the Peruvians, who tried to hold their ground in defense. The Mexican side came back to score a goal but it was not nearly enough and Juan Aurich entered the group stage of the Libertadores by defeating Estudiantes Tecos 4–1 on aggregate. On 17 March 2010 Reimond Manco was chosen as Man of the Match in a 4–2 Copa Libertadores win over as of then undefeated group leaders Alianza Lima, where he provided an assist and scored a goal.|$|E

Although studying graphics, she also took lettering classes, as did Lennon. He never had any drawing tools with him, so he constantly borrowed pens and pencils from Powell, who discovered he was only there because other teachers had refused to instruct him. She had an air of respectability and moved in different social circles than her future husband.

Pam points out that {{if she were to}} get a new computer for one sales rep, she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> one for every sales rep. Unwilling to let it go, Andy convinces Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) into trading computers with him. Pam is angry when she finds out, and forces him to switch the computers back. In addition to continue pushing for a new computer, Andy confronts Pam about humiliating him in front of the office. In order to make it up to him, she tells him that the only way he can get a new computer is if his breaks. To accomplish this, he accepts all cookies, intentionally opens pop-up ads, and places food in the disc drive. Pam then buys Andy a new computer, but they scratch it up to make it not look brand new. When they pretend to argue about {{it in front of the}} office, Pam claims that she found it in the warehouse. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) confronts Pam later regarding finding the computer in the warehouse. As he knows everything that is in the warehouse and where it is stored, he leverages Pam into giving him more sick days. Pam gleefully tells the interviewers that she is now [...] "full-on corrupt".|$|E

He {{said that the}} troops [...] "were worrying quite {{a lot about you}} folks at home, but we soon put them right about that. We told them that after four and a half years, Britain was still the best country to live in". Shortly after he began filming He Snoops to Conquer—his fifth picture for Columbia—he was visited on set by the Dance Music Policy Committee (DMPC), an organisation responsible for vetting music for broadcast, which had also been given responsibility for checking if music was sympathetic towards the enemy during the war. The DMPC interviewed Formby about three songs that had been included in Bell-Bottom George: [...] "Swim Little Fish", [...] "If I Had a Girl Like You" [...] and [...] "Bell-Bottom George". Formby was summoned to the BBC's offices to perform his three songs in front of the committee, with his song checked against the available sheet music. A week later, on 1 February, the committee met and decided the songs were innocuous, although Formby was told that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> further clearance if the lyrics were changed. Bret opines that he had been the victim of a plot {{by a member of the}} Variety Artists' Federation, following Formby's scathing comments on entertainers who were too scared to leave London to entertain the troops. The comments, which appeared in the forces magazine Union Jack, were then widely reported in the press in Britain. The Variety Artists' Federation demanded that Formby release names, and threatened him with action if he did not do so, but he refused to give in to their pressure.|$|E

Two days after taking command of 8th Army, Wöhler also asked Manstein for permission to abandon the city.

2500|$|In 1862, senior {{political}} {{figures in the}} Tokugawa shogunate created the post of Kyoto Shugoshoku (Kyoto Military Commissioner), {{for the purpose of}} recovering public order in the city, which was under the influence of Sonnō Jōi militants. The post of Kyoto Shugoshoku was one that changed much of the dynamic that had theretofore existed in the city. Previously, the holder of the Kyoto shoshidai (...) position had held the highest power there, supervising affairs in the Kyoto-Osaka area as the representative of the Shogun. However, the successive Shoshidai, as well as the city magistrates under their charge, were increasingly unable to secure and maintain the public order, so the post of Shugoshoku was superimposed on the existing structure. Where the Shoshidai and magistrates had been unable to secure through civil law, the Shugoshoku was to achieve through the use of military force. After much deliberation, the choice for the Shugoshoku post came down to two domains: Echizen and Aizu. Of the two, Echizen's Matsudaira Yoshinaga already held high Shogunal office as President of Political Affairs ( [...] ; seiji sōsai-shoku), so all attention was then turned to Matsudaira Katamori. As Katamori was ill, Aizu's senior Edo-based councilor Yokoyama Tsunenori was summoned to Edo Castle instead, and given word of the assignment. Katamori sent a retainer back with a request for being excused: [...] "As this is a shogunal order, we not only {{have no choice but to}} accept. Furthermore, our domain's founder Lord [...] Masayuki laid down a direct command to do so in our house code. However, our lord Katamori is still young, and our men are in the north and unfamiliar with conditions in the Capital. If we were to accept this assignment without question, and a one in ten thousand chance of disaster were to strike, we of the Aizu domain could not possibly do it all alone; the Shogun <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> involved, as would all of Japan. We would like to consider this carefully." [...] However, the Bakufu would not listen to this refusal. Matsudaira Yoshinaga traveled personally to the Aizu residence, and confronted Katamori with harsh words invoking Aizu's distinguished past as Shogunate functionaries: [...] "If [...] Lord Masayuki were still alive, he would accept without a second thought!" [...] Rumors began to circulate that Katamori refused the assignment out of a desire for self-preservation, to which Katamori is said to have responded, [...] "If people start talking like this, it will shame our domain. There is no way I could explain this to the generations of Aizu lords who have gone before me. I have no choice but to accept." ...|$|E
