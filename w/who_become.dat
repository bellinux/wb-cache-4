5|$|Children {{are less}} likely than adults to clear the infection. More than 95% of people <b>who</b> <b>become</b> {{infected}} as adults or older children will stage a full recovery and develop protective immunity to the virus. However, this drops to 30% for younger children, and only 5% of newborns that acquire the infection from their mother at birth will clear the infection. This population has a 40% lifetime risk of death from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Of those infected between the age of one to six, 70% will clear the infection.|$|E

Tournament wins are secondary due to many tournaments being country specific and thus not generally a national achievement to win. Runners-up and The Ultimate Fighter runners-up are not included.|$|E
5|$|Given with {{chloroquine}} or quinine, clindamycin {{is effective}} and well tolerated in treating Plasmodium falciparum malaria; the latter combination is particularly useful for children, {{and is the}} treatment of choice for pregnant women <b>who</b> <b>become</b> infected in areas where resistance to chloroquine is common. Clindamycin {{should not be used}} as an antimalarial by itself, although it appears to be very effective as such, because of its slow action. Patient-derived isolates of Plasmodium falciparum from the Peruvian Amazon have been reported to be resistant to clindamycin as evidenced by in vitro drug susceptibility testing.|$|E

5|$|A {{procedure}} {{for dealing with}} omitted decompression stops is described in the US Navy Diving Manual. In principle the procedure allows a diver who is not yet presenting symptoms of decompression sickness, to go back down and complete the omitted decompression, with some extra added {{to deal with the}} bubbles which are assumed to have formed during the period where the decompression ceiling was violated. Divers <b>who</b> <b>become</b> symptomatic before they can be returned to depth are treated for decompression sickness, and do not attempt the omitted decompression procedure as the risk is considered unacceptable under normal operational circumstances.|$|E
5|$|In {{women with}} known {{hypothyroidism}} <b>who</b> <b>become</b> pregnant, {{it is recommended}} that serum TSH levels are closely monitored. Levothyroxine should be used to keep TSH levels within the normal range for that trimester. The first trimester normal range is below 2.5mIU/L and the second and third trimesters normal range is below 3.0mIU/L. Treatment should be guided by total (rather than free) thyroxine or by the free T4 index. Similarly to TSH, the thyroxine results should be interpreted according to the appropriate reference range for that stage of pregnancy. The levothyroxine dose often needs to be increased after pregnancy is confirmed, although this is based on limited evidence and some recommend that it is not always required; decisions may need to based on TSH levels.|$|E

5|$|Incorrect {{figures are}} {{sometimes}} cited {{for the population}} of ASL speakers in the United States based on misunderstandings of known statistics. Demographics of the deaf population have been confused with those of ASL use, since adults <b>who</b> <b>become</b> deaf late in life rarely use ASL in the home. This accounts for currently cited estimations which are greater than 500,000; such mistaken estimations can reach as high as 15,000,000. A 100,000-person lower bound has been cited for ASL users; {{the source of this}} figure is unclear, but it may be an estimate of prelingual deafness, which is correlated with but not equivalent to signing.|$|E
