5|$|Akkad {{disintegrated}} during Shar-Kali-Sharri's reign, and Mari gained its independence, but {{the use of}} the Shakkanakku title continued {{during the}} following Third Dynasty of Ur period.

However, the vassalage did not impede the independence of Mari, and some Shakkanakkus used the royal title Lugal in their votive inscriptions, <b>while</b> <b>using</b> the title of Shakkanakku in their correspondence with the Ur's court. The dynasty ended for unknown reasons not long before the establishment of the next dynasty, which took place {{in the second half of}} the 19th century BC.|$|E

5|$|Atwood's use of myths follows archetypal {{literary}} criticism and specifically {{the work of}} Northrop Frye and his Anatomy of Criticism.

In The Penelopiad, Atwood re-writes archetypes of female passivity and victimization <b>while</b> <b>using</b> contemporary ideas of justice and a variety of genres.|$|E
