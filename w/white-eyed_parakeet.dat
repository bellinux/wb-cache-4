50|$|<b>White-eyed</b> <b>parakeets</b> are {{sometimes}} confused with Finsch's parakeets because both have {{the red and}} yellow epaulets under their wings. The <b>white-eyed</b> <b>parakeets</b> lack the red triangle on the forehead as adults.In captivity they can live for nearly 28 years.|$|R
50|$|<b>White-eyed</b> <b>parakeets</b> {{are found}} {{over much of}} {{northern}} South America, from eastern Venezuela, Colombia and the Guianas in the north across Brazil to northern Argentina and Uruguay in forests, woodland, savanna and mangroves. Adapts readily to degraded and urban areas, provided there are sources of food and nesting places (under roofs and other cavities) and occurs in several cities.|$|R
50|$|Birds {{reported}} {{in the area are}} the Andean cock-of-the-rock, the oilbird, the <b>white-eyed</b> <b>parakeet,</b> Salvin's curassow, Spix's guan, the blue-headed parrot, the king vulture, the Amazonian motmot, among others.|$|E
50|$|Though not {{as popular}} {{as some of the}} more {{colorful}} parakeets, the <b>white-eyed</b> <b>parakeet</b> can become a sweet, loving and talkative pet. They are seldom destructive and are generally not screamers, often choosing to mimic speech instead. Although many breeders ignore this species, those that do breed them appreciate their good parenting skills. Breeding requirements for white-eyed parakeets are much the same as for other parakeet species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-eyed</b> <b>parakeet</b> {{measures}} 30 - 34 cm {{in length}} and 37 - 40 cm in wingspan, with a body mass of 100 - 218 g. is an overall green bird with red on the shoulders and some random flecks of red {{on the head and}} neck. The underwing primary coverts are red tipped yellow. A prominent white eye ring gives this species its name. In addition to the nominate, there are two very similar subspecies, callogenys and nicefori, although the validity of the latter, based on a single specimen, is questionable. Juveniles have little or no red and yellow in their plumage.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The <b>white-eyed</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Aratinga leucophthalma), {{also known}} in Brazil as “periquitão-maracanã, ” “aratinga-de-bando, ” “araguaí ” and “maritaca, ” {{belongs to the}} family Psittacidae. The fungal genus Malassezia, which lives {{on the surface of}} the skin and mucosae of some mammals and birds, is a {{commensal}} organism that may sometimes act as a pathogen. This paper describes the presence of Malassezia spp at the edge of the eye of a <b>white-eyed</b> <b>parakeet</b> seized by IBAMA (Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources) and examined at the Federal University of Uberlândia (UFU) Veterinary Hospital. The examination of the bird revealed the presence of a small white rounded structure at the edge of its right eye. The bird was sedated and a fragment of the structure was removed and sent to the university’s Laboratory of Infectious Diseases. This material was seeded in blood and MacConkey agars and a slide was prepared and stained by the Gram-staining technique; no biochemical assays were performed. Reading was performed in an optical microscope under 100 X magnification, revealing flattened oval colonies resembling purplish footprints, indicative of Malassezia spp. The bird was not treated because the structure gradually diminished in size until it disappeared completely after the animal was isolated in a clean well ventilated place and supplied with water and good quality food suitable for the species. It is believed that the development of the atypical and uncommon foreign body in the bird’s eye may hav...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{wild and}} {{domestic}} birds, cryptosporidiosis is {{often associated with}} infections by Cryptosporidium galli, Cryptosporidium baileyi and Cryptosporidium meleagridis. In addition to these species, a number of avian Cryptosporidium species yet to be fully characterized are commonly found among exotic and wild avian isolates. The present study aimed to detect and identify samples of Cryptosporidium spp. from free-living wild birds, in order to contribute to the knowledge of the variability of this parasite in the free-living population of Brazil. Stool samples were collected from 242 birds, with the following proportions of individuals: 50 Emberizidae (20. 7 %), 112 Psittacidae (46. 3 %), 44 Cardinalidae (18. 2 %), 12 Turdidae (5. 0 %), eight Ramphastidae (3. 3 %), seven Icteridae (2. 9 %), three Estrilididae (1. 2 %), two Contigidae (0. 8 %), two Thraupidae (0. 8 %) and two Fringilidae (0. 8 %). Among the 242 fecal samples from wild birds, 16 (6. 6 %) were positive for the presence of oocysts of Cryptosporidium. Molecular characterization of the 16 samples of Cryptosporidium, were performed with phylogenetic reconstructions employing 292 positions of 18 S rDNA. None of the samples of birds was characterized as C. meleagridis. C. galli was identified in one rufous-bellied thrush (Turdus rufiventris), five green-winged saltators (Saltator similis), one slate-coloured seedeater (Sporophila schistacea), one goldfinch (Carduelis carduelis) and three saffron finches (Sicalis flaveola). One goldfinch isolate, one buffy-fronted seedeater (Sporophila frontalis), one red-cowled cardinal (Paroaria dominicana) and one other saffron finch (S. flaveola) were identified as C. baileyi. Avian genotype II was found in an isolate from a <b>white-eyed</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Aratinga leucophthalma). Clinical symptoms of cryptosporidiosis in birds have already been described and the number of wild birds which were shedding parasites was high. Therefore, further epidemiological research and disease surveillance of birds in the wild is warranted...|$|E
