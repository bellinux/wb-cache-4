Of critical importance is the drastic decline of durability associated with these cracks, and the resulting cost of repair or replacement of concrete structures. This research examines the effect <b>of</b> crack <b>width</b> and crack frequency upon the durability of reinforced mortar, quantified by water permeability. Crack widths tested range from 0 mm (for uncracked mortar) up to 2. 7 mm. In addition to mortar, the durability performance of Engineered Cementitious Composites, or ECC, are also investigated in the cracked state. This high performance fiber reinforced cementitious composite exhibits closely spaced microcracks with inherently tight crack widths, typically less than 80 micron, even when strained up to 5 % in uniaxial tension.

Thick twins viewed {{in the same way}} have a microscopically visible <b>width</b> <b>of</b> twinned <b>material</b> between black lines.

Mean calcite twin width correlates directly with temperature of deformation such that thin twins dominate below 170 °C and thick twins dominate above 200 °C. Above 250 °C dynamic recrystallization is an important deformation mechanism in calcite. Mean twin intensity (twin planes/mm) correlates negatively with temperature, and a cross plot of twin intensity with twin width can yield information about both strain and temperature of deformation.

The <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the plasticised <b>material</b> around the pin {{and the material}} volume carried per rotation determines the restriction <b>of</b> the <b>material</b> to flow from the retreating side to the advancing side, inside the cavity. The cavity is created behind the tool pin due to the unconsumed volume of the plunged pin. In order to maintain a large heat input during friction-stir welding, the transverse speed can be reduced, thereby generating more heat and more plastic metal, which improves the flowability of the weld metal (Kumar and Satish Kailas 2008; Xiaopeng et al. 2014). Experimental results (Zhao 2014) suggest that {{the area in which}} tunnel defects can occur, increases greatly as the traverse speed increases. Increasing shoulder diameter significantly increases the heat input volume, which directly improves the flowability of the weld metal into the cavities. Therefore, optimised heat input and good flow patterns <b>of</b> the plastic <b>material</b> are necessary to avoid very cold processing conditions and thus eliminate tunnel defects. Hence, a welding tool with a relatively large shoulder can help reduce the occurrence of tunnel defects.|$|R

The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine equations that can estimate the mesiodistal <b>widths</b> <b>of</b> unerupted canines and premolars of both arches in the early mixed dentition period using total <b>widths</b> <b>of</b> mandibular incisors. <b>Materials</b> and Methods: In this observational cross-sectional study, 100 children (50 girls and 50 boys) aged 12 ‒ 13 years in the guidance schools of Isfahan were randomly selected. The subjects had no developmental or occlusion anomalies, with no visible malformations, caries or abrasions in their teeth. After impression and preparation of dental casts, mesiodistal dimensions of all the permanent mandibular incisors, canines, and first and second premolars were measured in both arches using a Vernier caliper. Pearson's correlation coefficient, linear regression and independent t-test were applied for statistical analysis (α = 0. 05). Results: Equations for this research were as follows: U = 9. 295 + 0. 549 (M), L = 6. 622 + 0. 633 (M) for girls and U = 13. 4 + 0. 38 (M), L = 11. 058 + 0. 455 (M) for boys, in which M is the total mesiodistal crown diameter of lower incisors, and U and L are the total mesiodistal crown diameters of canines and premolars in the maxilla and mandible, respectively. Statistically significant differences were observed in the total mesiodistal <b>widths</b> <b>of</b> canines and premolars between arches and genders. Correlation coefficients for the upper and lower arches were 0. 76 and 0. 83 in females, and 0. 63 and 0. 65 in males, respectively.
