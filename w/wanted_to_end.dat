5|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{cast and}} production changes over the years, Last of the Summer Wine {{continued to be}} popular with viewers and was renewed year after year despite reports to the contrary. Rumours circulated {{as early as the}} 1980s that the BBC <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> the show {{and replace it with a}} new programme aimed at a younger audience. Its popularity made this decision hard to justify, however, since even repeats sometimes received ratings of as many as five million viewers per episode.|$|E

5|$|After Kaká and Ancelotti left Milan in {{the summer}} of 2009, Chelsea tested Milan's resolve by bidding $12 million and Claudio Pizarro for Pirlo. The club {{rejected}} the offer and Pirlo was said to be contemplating a transfer request. On 5 August, club owner Silvio Berlusconi decided not to sell Pirlo, who said he was overjoyed and <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> his career at Milan.

5|$|By late December 1991, {{just over}} a month after victory had been proclaimed in Vukovar, opinion polls found that 64 percent <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> the war {{immediately}} and only 27 percent were willing for it to continue. Milošević and other senior Serbian leaders decided against continuing the fighting, as they saw it as politically impossible to mobilise more conscripts to fight in Croatia. Desertions from the JNA continued as the well-motivated and increasingly well-equipped Croatian Army became more difficult to counter. By the end of 1991, Serbia's political and military leadership concluded {{that it would be}} counter-productive to continue the war. The looming conflict in Bosnia also required that the military resources tied up in Croatia be freed for future use.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} October the Special Commission on Afghanistan, which {{consisted}} of Andropov, Gromyko, Ustinov and Ponomarev, <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> {{the impression that the}} Soviet government supported Amin's leadership and policy. The KGB's First Chief Directorate was put under orders that {{something had to be done}} about Afghanistan, and several of its personnel were assembled to deal with the task. Andropov fought hard for Soviet intervention, saying to Brezhnev that Amin's policies had destroyed the military and the government's capabilities to handle the crisis by use of mass repression. The plan, according to Andropov, was to assemble a small force to intervene and remove Amin from power and replace him with Karmal. The Soviet Union declared its plan to intervene in Afghanistan on 12 December 1979, and the Soviet leadership initiated Operation Storm-333 (the first phase of the intervention) on 27 December 1979.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, few Brazilians opposed {{slavery and}} even fewer openly {{condemned}} it. PedroII, who did not own slaves, {{was one of the}} few who did oppose slavery. Its abolition was a delicate subject. Slaves were used by everyone, from the richest to the poorest. PedroII <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> the practice gradually to soften the impact to the national economy. With no constitutional authority to directly intervene to abolish slavery, the Emperor would need to use all his skills to convince, influence and gather support among politicians to achieve his goal. His first open move occurred back in 1850, when he threatened to abdicate unless the General Assembly declared the Atlantic slave trade illegal.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, Akira Toriyama {{had created}} the popular manga Dr. Slump; within roughly six months, he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> the series but his {{publisher}} Shueisha would only allow {{him to do so}} if he agreed to start another serial for them shortly after. He worked with his editor, Kazuhiko Torishima, on several one-shots but none were successful. Torishima then suggested that as Toriyama enjoyed kung fu films, he should create a kung fu shōnen manga. This led to the two-part , published in the August and October 1983 issues of Fresh Jump. It follows a boy, adept at martial arts, who escorts a princess on a journey back to her home country. Dragon Boy was very well-received and evolved to become Dragon Ball.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} he worked on Yu Yu Hakusho, Togashi would {{calculate}} the personal time he had based on a formula of four hours per page without scripting and five hours of sleep per night. He wrote in his own dōjinshi Yoshirin de Pon! that he stopped the production on Yu Yu Hakusho out of selfishness. The author had originally <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> the manga in December 1993, at {{the climax of the}} Sensui arc. Although there was not a large demand from the editorial staff, Togashi was under a great deal of personal stress at certain points of the series' run, particularly during its final six months of publication. He claimed that, beginning with the Dark Tournament arc, inconsistent sleep resulting from overwork was causing him health problems. He noted himself as being very ill while working on the color pages for Yusuke's match with Chu. There were also many instances where he would create nearly entire manuscripts by himself, such as Yusuke's meeting with Raizen and the battle between Kurama and Karasu. Togashi was relieved {{at the conclusion of the}} manga. The author claimed to not have been involved in the production of the Yu Yu Hakusho anime adaptation due to his own work schedule. He stated that he was greatly impressed by Shigeru Chiba's voice depiction of Kuwabara, admitting that the voice actor understood the character better than Togashi himself.|$|E

In particular, he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> what he saw as the excesses of metaphysics.
