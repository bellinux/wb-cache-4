5|$|Despite {{having left}} TNA in June 2007, Konnan did not wrestle for AAA until October, and only {{wrestled}} in four matches during {{the remainder of}} the year, due to his aforementioned surgeries. Konnan returned to World Wrestling Council at WWC Euphoria Tour 2008 on January 6, 2008, with Ron Killings of the 3LiveKru, losing a tag team match against Eddy and Orlando Colon. In March 2008, Konnan sued TNA for racism and discrimination, alleging that <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> said that they would help pay for his hip replacement surgery, they did not. Konnan also claimed that TNA helped pay for Scott Steiner's operation, but did not pay for Ron Killings's surgery from around the same time.|$|E

5|$|Hoodwinked! {{was among}} the {{earliest}} computer-animated films to be completely independently funded. Working apart from a major studio allowed the filmmakers greater creative control, but also restrained them economically.

5|$|Rare co-founder Tim Stamper {{conceptualized}} a gardening {{game for}} the handheld Pocket PC platform in 2002. A three-person team began work on a simple prototype <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> was still affiliated with Nintendo, prior to its Microsoft acquisition. Development transferred to the original Xbox and, ultimately, to the Xbox 360 for its enhanced graphical capabilities. The development team wanted its animals to have a unified style, which was how the concept artist arrived at the piñata conceit. The idea was exciting for the team, as piñatas were not commonplace in the United Kingdom. The connection between piñatas and candy-filled insides led to new gameplay directions.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} testing period, the {{sandwich}} was renamed the Big King {{and added to}} the national menu {{at the end of}} the summer of 1997the first major product introduction since the company added its BK Broiler chicken sandwich in 1990. Unlike the Double Supreme, the new Big King lacked the interior bread piece the Big Mac had, and the advertising used to promote the Big King continued to utilize the 75% more beef claim. However, the new sandwich was introduced <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> was dealing with a highly publicized beef recall from one of its key suppliers, Hudson Foods, and had to deal with accusations that the introduction was designed to distract the public and media from the recall. The sandwich was initially introduced in the United States at a 99¢ (USD) price point, which helped propel sales to nearly twice the estimated volume and causing many locations to sell out of the burger patties used to produce the sandwich.|$|E

5|$|Environmental impact studies {{began on}} the part of SR 125 south of SR 54 in 1987. In 1990, Caltrans {{proposed}} building the southern portion as a toll road, operated by private firms; California Transportation Ventures (CTV) and PrivaCAL both applied for the role. In September, state officials approved this proposal, which was expected to cost $400 million. In the 1991 agreement, Caltrans agreed not to build more than one high-occupancy vehicle lane in each direction on I-805 to reduce competition from SR 125. CTV soon declared that they would be considering many potential routings for the road, including some that Caltrans had declined. The next year, <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> hoped to start the environmental impact study, objections were raised about increased pollution and traffic from the road, as well as the part of the franchise agreement that would allow for the company to collect a settlement if SR 905 was constructed with more than six lanes, since it would compete with the proposed toll road.|$|E
5|$|In July 2004, Blizzard Entertainment began {{collaboration}} with Swingin' Ape Studios {{to work on}} the game, and bought the company in May 2005. Despite anticipation for the game by industry journalists, Ghost was delayed again and its release date was pushed back to September 2005. At Electronic Entertainment Expo 2005, Ghost was officially reannounced, but the GameCube version was canceled by Swingin' Ape Studios due to the platform's lack of online support. The game's release was again delayed until 2006. Despite the efforts of Swingin' Ape, Ghost failed to materialize as scheduled, and in March 2006 Blizzard Entertainment announced an indefinite postponement on development of Ghost <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> explored new options with the emerging seventh generation of video game consoles. Despite its long development history, IGN noted that the concept of Ghost still held promise. Although the game's development was suspended, Keith R. A.

5|$|Minister of Local Government and Regional Development, Gunnar Berge, {{stated in}} January 1995 {{that he was}} {{concerned}} that the post-Olympic use funds were being used up too quickly and that money was being used for unsuitable projects. However, he rejected that the state should take control over the venues or the money. After one year, Lillehammer Olympiapark had used NOK32 of 146 million, <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> Olympia Utvikling/Troll Park had used NOK14 of 95 million. For the Lillehammer companies, {{this meant that the}} fund was estimated to run out after ten instead of twenty years. In contrast, Hamar Olympiske Anlegg had only used the fund's yield. LOOC criticized the post-Olympic use companies, stating that they were too bureaucratic, that their combined 100 employees were too many, and that one or two companies would be sufficient.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of May 30, the 54th Battalion's 1st Company {{attacked}} the area around Isdud's railway station, but was outgunned and had to retreat with four wounded. According to the company's report, the food {{that was given to}} them was rotten and further deteriorated the soldiers' ability to fight. On May 31, the Egyptian radio described the attack as a victory, and claimed hundreds of dead Israelis. The 3rd Company was unsuccessful, as intelligence on precise Egyptian positions was sparse, <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> gave its position away quickly. An Egyptian mortar scored a direct hit on one of the company's squads, which caused casualties and panic. One of the soldiers ran for cover, but lost direction, and ended up in Isdud. He walked around the village unnoticed and found a chance to return to Givati, and provided the command with invaluable information for the operation.|$|E
5|$|The {{newly formed}} company was {{required}} to complete the extension from Pwll y Llygod to Pontyates and {{the first section of}} the Llanelly branch {{to the point where it}} crossed the Ashburnham Canal within six years. Anthony Bower was the engineer, and construction was contracted to Pinkerton and Allen. The canal reached the new aqueduct across the Gwendraeth Fawr in 1815, but little progress was made between then and 1817. Much of the limited capital raised had been spent on attempts to re-open the harbour, with little success. A second Act of Parliament was obtained on 28 May 1818, which extended the time limit for building the canal and removed the requirement to clear the river channels to the harbour. Pinkerton and Allen pressed on with construction, completing the routes to Pontyates and the Ashburnham Canal crossing in 1824, <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> directors asked the engineers John Rennie and Edward Bankes to examine the issue of a suitable harbour. Rennie suggested extending the canal towards what is now Burry Port, and the construction of a new harbour on the sands at Tywyn Bach.|$|E
5|$|These probes {{intensified}} on 30 March, {{as one of}} the 25th Infantry Battalion's companies {{was strongly}} attacked by the Japanese. The Australian position had been weakened by having about a third of its strength out on patrol {{at the time of the}} attack. Unable to return to the perimeter <b>while</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> was under fire, they were forced to link up with one of the other companies further north. Meanwhile, the company was attacked four times throughout the day. The first three attacks were repulsed before the last attack came at 13:00, preceded by a heavy mortar bombardment. Twelve Japanese were killed in the attack, while one Australian was killed and two were missing in action. Nevertheless, the Australian position had been made untenable and they were forced to withdraw and link up with the company to the north. In doing so they left behind three mortars and a quantity of ammunition which the Japanese later brought into action against them.|$|E
