5|$|Past {{surveys are}} suspect, as Grimm (1981) and Hubricht (1985) no longer believe that Novisuccinea ovalis even occurs in Novisuccinea chittenangoensis habitat at Chittenango Falls. They surmise, rather, that earlier {{reported}} specimens of Novisuccinea ovalis were instead immature Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. However, {{a review of}} photographic records showed shells of Novisuccinea ovalis that <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> at the Falls when the type specimens of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis <b>were</b> <b>collected.</b> Apparently, Novisuccinea ovalis occurred {{at or near the}} Falls historically but is no longer encountered there or is only located in adjacent habitats. Therefore, relative comparisons between the two species' abundance is problematic and confusing.|$|E

5|$|Early {{discoveries of}} indricotheres were made through various colonial links to Asia. The first known indricothere fossils <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> from Balochistan (in modern-day Pakistan) in 1846 by a soldier named Vickary, but these {{fragments}} were unidentifiable at the time. The first fossils now recognised as Paraceratherium were {{discovered by the}} British geologist Guy Ellcock Pilgrim in Balochistan in 1907–1908. His material consisted of an upper jaw, lower teeth, {{and the back of}} a jaw. The fossils <b>were</b> <b>collected</b> in the Chitarwata Formation of Dera Bugti, where Pilgrim had previously been exploring. In 1908, he used the fossils as basis for a new species of the extinct rhinoceros genus Aceratherium; A. bugtiense. Aceratherium was by then a wastebasket taxon; it included several unrelated species of hornless rhinoceros, many of which have since been moved to other genera. Fossil incisors that Pilgrim had previously assigned to the unrelated genus Bugtitherium were later shown to belong to the new species.|$|E
