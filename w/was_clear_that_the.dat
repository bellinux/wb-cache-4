5|$|After {{a heated}} week of pre-fight confrontations, fans were expecting {{something}} special from Danny Garcia vs. Zab Judah. And the fighters delivered, though in an unanticipated fashion. From early on it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bad blood would not adversely impact the fight, as both men fought strong technical fights.|$|E
5|$|By July 1918, it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> German Spring Offensive on the Western Front, {{which had}} forced the {{postponement}} of offensive plans in Palestine, had failed, {{resulting in a}} return to trench warfare on the Western Front. This coincided with {{the approach of the}} campaigning season in the Middle East.|$|E

5|$|Arise is {{the fourth}} studio album by Brazilian heavy metal band Sepultura, {{released}} in 1991 by Roadrunner Records. Upon its release, the album received top reviews from heavy metal magazines such as Rock Hard, Kerrang! and Metal Forces. Arise is considered Sepultura's finest hour among longtime fans. While the music on Arise was mostly in the same death/thrash style as their previous album, Beneath the Remains, it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Sepultura sound was acquiring an experimental edge.|$|E
5|$|As {{the returns}} were tallied on {{election}} day, it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> race was close: Democrats had carried {{most of the}} South, as well as New York, Indiana, Connecticut, and New Jersey. In the Northeast, {{an increasing number of}} immigrants and their descendants voted Democratic. The official popular vote also favored Tilden (there was some Southern suppression of Republican votes), but Republicans realized that if they held the three unredeemed southern states together with some of the western states, they would emerge with an electoral college majority.|$|E
5|$|By 1877 it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{situation}} had become impractical. After letters {{were published in}} The Field deriding the state of affairs {{it was decided to}} unite the kicking game under one set of laws. By this time the FA Cup had helped the FA gain a dominant position within the game. The FA accepted the Sheffield rule allowing throw-ins to be thrown in any direction, as opposed to right angles only as prevails in rugby lineouts. In return the FA's use of a three-man offside was adopted.|$|E

5|$|By early 1945, Germany's {{military}} {{situation was}} on the verge of total collapse. Hitler, presiding over a rapidly disintegrating Third Reich, retreated to his Führerbunker in Berlin on 16 January 1945. To the Nazi leadership, it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> battle for Berlin would be the final battle of the war. Berlin was bombarded by Soviet artillery for the first time on 20 April 1945 (Hitler's birthday). By the evening of 21 April, Red Army tanks reached the outskirts of the city. By 27 April, Berlin was cut off from the rest of Germany.|$|E
5|$|During 18 August 1940, Luftwaffe units flew a {{total of}} 970 sorties over Britain: some 495 by medium bombers, 460 by fighters and 15 by {{reconnaissance}} units. Of this total, about 170 of the bomber sorties were flown {{on the night of}} 17/18 August; the remainder were flown during the daylight hours on 18 August. Less than half of the available (or serviceable) aircraft on the Luftflotte 2 and Luftflotte 3 order of battle were involved in the action that day, so it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Luftwaffe was not greatly extended in providing forces for the offensive. Luftflotte 5 did not take any part in the fighting, although its reconnaissance aircraft were active over England and Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Fifty-eight {{cardinals}} {{were present}} on 9 October when the conclave began. Since Charles II was dying at this time, Spain's cardinal electors were unsure {{of how they}} should vote, {{and they did not}} work closely with electors that were loyal to the Holy Roman Emperor. From the beginning, it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> impending death of Charles II was likely to cause a lengthy conclave, because the next pope would be expected to respond to the anticipated political crisis in Spain following Charles' imminent death.|$|E

5|$|In September 1899, it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{crisis in}} South Africa {{was likely to}} turn into war. By 2 October, all {{military}} leave had been cancelled, and urgent preparations were under way to send a large expeditionary force to the Cape, with horses and supplies being requisitioned and mobilised. On 7 October, a proclamation was issued calling out the Army Reserve. Of 65,000 liable men, around 25,000 were intended to be called up for service. The Second Boer War broke out on 11 October.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{majority}} of known extrasolar planets, Upsilon Andromedae d was detected by measuring variations in its star's radial velocity {{as a result of}} the planet's gravity. This was done by making precise measurements of the Doppler shift of the spectrum of Upsilon Andromedae A. At the time of discovery, Upsilon Andromedae A was already known to host one extrasolar planet, the hot Jupiter Upsilon Andromedae b; however, by 1999, it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> inner planet could not explain the velocity curve.|$|E
5|$|Serrate {{was first}} fitted to Beaufighter Mk. VIF {{aircraft}} of No. 141 Squadron RAF in June 1943. They began operations using Serrate {{on the night}} of 14 June, and by 7 September had claimed 14 German fighters shot down, for 3 losses. The squadron was later handed to No. 100 Group RAF, who handled special operations within Bomber Command including jamming and similar efforts. In spite of their successes, it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Beaufighter lacked the speed needed to catch the German aircraft, and Mosquitoes began to replace them late in 1943.|$|E

5|$|The Hunter entered {{service with}} the Royal Air Force as an {{interceptor}} aircraft. It {{was the first}} jet aircraft produced by Hawker for the RAF. From the outset it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> type had exceptional performance, being the first RAF aircraft capable of effectively matching the English Electric Canberra bomber. The Hunter also set numerous aviation records, including absolute speed records. The type was also lauded for its quick turnaround time, enabled by features such as its removable gun pack, pressurised fuelling system, and easy handling in flight.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{submarine}} {{offensive against}} Australia was broken off in July 1943 when the submarines were redeployed to counter Allied offensives {{elsewhere in the}} Pacific. The last two Japanese submarines to be dispatched against the Australian east coast, I-177 and I-180, were redirected to the central Solomon Islands shortly before they would have arrived off Australia in July. The Australian Naval authorities were concerned about a resumption of attacks, however, and maintained the coastal convoy system until late 1943 when it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> threat had passed. Coastal convoys in waters south of Newcastle ceased on 7 December and convoys off the north-east coast and between Australia and New Guinea were abolished in February and March 1944 respectively.|$|E
5|$|Through the 1991 season, it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> team's core {{players on}} defense had aged quickly. This {{deterioration}} continued in 1992, when Lawrence Taylor ruptured his Achilles tendon in the team's tenth game, and the Giants promptly lost {{six out of}} their last seven games to finish the year 6–10. The defense continued its descent, finishing 26th {{in the league in}} points allowed after leading the league in that category in 1990. Handley, who had become unpopular with both players and fans, was fired {{after the end of the}} regular season.|$|E

5|$|With so {{many people}} involved, {{security}} was a difficult task. A special Counter Intelligence Corps detachment was formed to handle the Manhattan Project's security issues. By 1943, it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union was attempting to penetrate the project. The most successful Soviet spy was Klaus Fuchs of the British Mission. The 1950 revelation of his espionage activities damaged the United States' nuclear cooperation with Britain and Canada. Subsequently, other instances of espionage were uncovered, leading {{to the arrest of}} Harry Gold, David Greenglass and Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. Other spies like Theodore Hall remained unknown for decades.|$|E
5|$|By the {{afternoon}} of 19 September, it <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> breakthrough attacks in the Battle of Sharon by the XXI Corps had been successful, and the XX Corps was ordered to begin the Battle of Nablus by attacking the well-defended Ottoman front line, supported by an artillery barrage. These attacks continued {{late into the night}} and throughout the next day, until the early hours of 21 September when the continuing successful flanking attack by the XXI Corps, combined with the XX Corps assault and aerial bombing attacks, forced the Seventh and Eighth Armies to disengage. The Ottoman Seventh Army retreated from the Nablus area down the Wadi el Fara road towards the Jordan River, aiming to cross at the Jisr ed Damieh bridge, leaving a rearguard to defend Nablus. The town was captured by the XX Corps and the 5th Light Horse Brigade, while devastating aerial bombing of the Wadi el Fara road, blocked that line of retreat. As all objectives had now been won, no further attacks were required of the XX Corps, which captured thousands of prisoners in the area and at Nablus and Balata.|$|E
5|$|It <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> planned {{processing}} flow {{could not be}} followed and still meet the 1986 launch date. It was decided on Cosmonaut's Day (12 April) 1985 to ship the flight model of the base block to the Baikonur cosmodrome and conduct the systems testing and integration there. The module arrived at the launch site on 6 May, with 1100 of 2500 cables requiring rework {{based on the results}} of tests to the ground test model at Khrunichev. In October, the base block was rolled outside its cleanroom to carry out communications tests. The first launch attempt on 16 February 1986 was scrubbed when the spacecraft communications failed, but the second launch attempt, on 19 February 1986 at 21:28:23 UTC, was successful, meeting the political deadline.|$|E
