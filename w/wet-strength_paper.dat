50|$|SSO {{programs}} have been launched {{in a wide range}} of venues, including single-family residential units, commercial businesses, events, food processors, schools, hospitals, and airports. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has assembled tools and resources for food waste management to assist communities interested in launching their own food waste reduction and collection efforts. SSO materials are typically collected in <b>wet-strength</b> <b>paper</b> bags, unlined plastic bins, or compostable film-plastic liners that meet ASTM 6400 standards.|$|E
40|$|The {{modification}} of existing chemical manufacturing processes to selectively remove unwanted chemicals in products, offers a realistic approach to novel clean technologies. Adjunct biotechnological processing offers {{a means to}} achieve the manufacture of new environmentally enhanced products (EEPs). This paper describes {{the development and implementation}} of a bioprocess for the manufacture of an enhanced paper chemical. The process was integrated into existing manufacturing plants involved in the production of neutral curing poly(aminoamide) chemicals which are used commercially to impart <b>wet-strength</b> to <b>paper</b> products such as tissues and towels (e. g. Kymene(R) wet-strength resins). A consequence of the epichlorohydrin chemistry involved in the polymer's manufacture, haloalcohols (predominantly, 1, 3 -dichloropropan- 2 -ol (DCP) and 1 -chloropropanediol (3 -CPD)) contaminate the product. The objective was to reduce the concentration of the two haloalcohols in Kymene(R) -SLX wet-strength resins (c. 8000 ppm db) without affecting the performance of the product. A two-membered bacterial consortium was used in an aerobic stirred tank bioreactor system which was capable of rapidly reducing the concentrations of DCP and CPD in an aqueous solution of the wet-strength resin to less than 1 ppm and 5 ppm respectively. A 3000 dm(3) bioreactor was integrated into two established manufacturing plants, generating a reliable and predictable process to enhance the value of the neutral curing wet-strength chemical...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A polymer was {{synthesized}} by emulsion copolymerization of styrene (St), glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) and isoprene. Sodium dodecyl sulfate {{was used}} as emulsifier, while sodium persulfate was the initiator. The effect of the polymer on <b>paper</b> <b>wet-strength</b> and dry-strength was investigated. The polymer contains phenyl groups which confer hydrophobicity to fibers so as to improve paper wet performance, and epoxy groups that can react with carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups in fibers aiming to increase paper strength, and double bonds toward self-polymerization in certain condition. Prepared polymer was applied to make handsheets of wood pulp and the handsheets were cured by high temperature or UV radiation. The Raman spectra showed that the polymer contained hydrophobic benzene, epoxy groups and double bonds. The SEM analysis indicated that paper fracture was caused by fiber breakage, which supported {{the theory that the}} polymer could increase interfiber-bonding strength. The experimental results indicated that the best monomer molar ratio was 1 : 1 : 1, while the optimum reaction conditions were a temperature of 40 °C and a reaction time of 5 hours...|$|R
40|$|Wet {{strength}} {{is one of}} paper’s most important properties. It can be developed by addition of wet strength additives during the fabrication process. Hereby paper products that require high wet strength, such as kitchen towels and bank note paper, are achieved. This study aims to examine new polymers for future use as <b>wet-strength</b> additive in <b>paper.</b> One of them, a natural biopolymer, has in earlier studies proved to work well as wet strength additive. The objective was to find out in what extent this biopolymer could improve wet strength. A final evaluation was based on mechanical testing of sheets made from bleached Kraft fibres modified by the biopolymer. Wet-strength polymers are used to develop or conserve the mechanical strength of <b>paper</b> when wetted. <b>Wet-strength</b> agents are added in various paper products such as: hand towels, hygiene paper and packaging grades. According to the chemical composition of these agents they can act either as protective agents by preventing fibre swelling and protecting already existing bonds, or they form new and water resistant bonds through reinforcement mechanisms. The natural biopolymer has a structure that {{is very similar to}} the cellulose structure. This fact together with the reactive functions of the biopolymer probably makes it possible to adsorb it to cellulose fibres. Pre-treatments of fibres were done by adding 0. 5 and 2 % biopolymer to the paper pulp. The adsorption was evaluated by measuring the surface charge of pre-treated fibres. This most popular wet-strength today is PAE (poly(aminoamide) - epichlorohydrin)) but it has some drawbacks. PAE makes paper stiffer and decreases the absorption capacity which is useful in packaging products but not in tissue paper. Other drawbacks of PAE are its bad repulpability, degradability and toxic monomers. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
