5|$|Grant {{was accused}} by Senator Charles Sumner in 1872 of {{practicing}} nepotism while President. Sumner's accusation {{was not an}} exaggeration. Grant's cousin Silas A. Hudson was appointed minister to Guatemala. His brother-in-law Reverend M.J. Cramer was appointed as consul at Leipzig. His brother-in-law James F. Casey was given the position of Collector of Customs in New Orleans, Louisiana where he made money by stealing fees. Frederick Dent, another brother-in-law <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House usher and made money giving out insider information.

5|$|Noel Francis Parrish (November 11, 1909– April 7, 1987) was a Brigadier General in the United States Air Force who <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> {{commander}} {{of a group}} of black airmen known as the Tuskegee Airmen during World War II.

He served in the military from 1930 until 1964, and retired as a brigadier general in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Rock {{and roll}} {{developed}} out of country, blues, and R Rock's exact origins and early influences have been hotly debated, {{and are the}} subjects of much scholarship. Though squarely in the blues tradition, rock took elements from Afro-Caribbean and Latin musical techniques. Rock was an urban style, formed in the areas where diverse populations resulted in the mixtures of African American, Latin and European genres ranging from the blues and country to polka and zydeco. Rock and roll first entered popular music through a style called rockabilly, which fused the nascent sound with elements of country music. Black-performed rock and roll had previously had limited mainstream success, but it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> performer Elvis Presley who first appealed to mainstream audiences with a black style of music, {{becoming one of the}} best-selling musicians in history, and brought rock and roll to audiences across the world.|$|E

5|$|VAT {{could offer}} only petrol engines until 1953. The most common ones were the Hercules engines made {{domestically}} under licence by SAT and Tampella. The SAT-made engine {{was called the}} Sisu AMG or SA5, and the engine made by Tampella was the Tampella 6000. The second most common engine was the Cadillac V8 1G and the third <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> 160 AX, which Kytölä had bought from Central Europe. Some Bedford petrol engines were used in Defence Forces lorries in the 1960s and Ford V8 engines were used for fire engines. The first diesel Vanajas were powered by Saurer and Kämper engines. The vast majority of diesel engines were supplied by Leyland and AEC. A few Vanajas were equipped with the Perkins R6 or the Ford Trader 510E. In some cases, the engine {{was provided by the}} customer; one Vanaja was powered by a Mercedes-Benz diesel engine.|$|E

25|$|The Upper Peninsula {{is rich in}} mineral {{deposits}} including iron, copper, {{nickel and}} silver. Small amounts of gold have also been discovered and mined. In the 19th century, mining dominated the economy, and the U.P. became home to many isolated company towns. For many years, mines in the Keweenaw Peninsula were the world's largest producers of copper (see Copper mining in Michigan). The mines began declining as early as 1913, with most closing temporarily during the Great Depression. Mines reopened during World War II, but almost all quickly closed after the war ended. The last copper mine in the Copper Country <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Pine mine, which closed in 1995.|$|E
25|$|After the July Revolution, he {{held the}} posts of Naval Minister under the nominal {{leadership}} of François Guizot (autumn 1830), and Foreign Affairs under Jacques Laffitte and Casimir Pierre Perier. During the Revolution, he parted with the Left, and made declarations in support of Charles X—including one which proclaimed that the only national flag <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> one for the Bourbons. Allegedly establishing links with the radical Aide-toi, le ciel t'aidera society {{in the early days}} of the July Monarchy, he subsequently rallied with the centrist politics of the Orléanist camp. With Laffitte, Benjamin Constant, Jean-Guillaume Hyde de Neuville, Adolphe Thiers, and others, he played a prominent part in calling Louis-Philippe to the French throne.|$|E
25|$|In {{built up}} {{cities around the}} world, urban {{planning}} uses cycling infrastructure like bikeways to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution. A number of cities {{around the world have}} implemented schemes known as bicycle sharing systems or community bicycle programs. The first of these <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Bicycle plan in Amsterdam in 1965. It was followed by yellow bicycles in La Rochelle and green bicycles in Cambridge. These initiatives complement public transport systems and offer an alternative to motorized traffic to help reduce congestion and pollution. In Europe, especially in the Netherlands and parts of Germany and Denmark, bicycle commuting is common. In Copenhagen, a cyclists' organization runs a Cycling Embassy that promotes biking for commuting and sightseeing. The United Kingdom has a tax break scheme (IR 176) that allows employees to buy a new bicycle tax free to use for commuting.|$|E

25|$|A major {{motive for}} lynchings, {{particularly}} in the South, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> society's efforts to maintain white supremacy after emancipation of slaves following the American Civil War; they punished perceived violations of customs, later institutionalized as Jim Crow laws, which mandated racial segregation of whites and blacks, and second-class status for blacks. A 2017 National Bureau of Economic Research paper found that more racially segregated counties {{were more likely to}} experience lynchings. Economic competition was another major factor; independent black farmers or businessmen were sometimes lynched or suffered destruction of their property. In the Deep South, the number of lynchings was higher in areas with a concentration of blacks in an area (such as a county), dependent on cotton and at a time of low cotton prices, rising inflation, a predominance of Democrats, and competition among religious groups.|$|E
25|$|The summer service uniform was a two-piece {{green and}} white outfit made of {{washable}} seersucker material. It had two pieces, a skirt and a short-sleeved jacket with a V-neck. The cap was green and decorated with a white cord, buttons were white, chevrons were green, and emblems were bronze. The shoes were brown, the gloves were white, and the handbags were light green. The summer dress uniform was made of white twill. It had short sleeves and a V-neck, worn with gilt buttons on the jacket and cap, with dress emblems and white pumps. The officers could choose between three summer dress uniforms. The first <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> one worn by enlisted women, but with added green shoulder straps.

25|$|Nine-year-old Cassie Logan {{is walking}} {{to school with}} her {{siblings}} Stacey (twelve years old), Christopher-John (seven years old), and Little Man whose real name is Clayton Chester Logan (six years old) in rural Mississippi. Cassie talks about the land on which the Logan family lives. It belonged to Harlan Granger, but he sold 2000 acres of it in 1886 to cover his taxes during Reconstruction. Their grandfather bought two hundred acres in 1887, then another two hundred acres in 1918. After several miles of walking, T.J. Avery and his brother appear. The Avery family sharecrop on the Granger plantation. At school, Cassie and Little Man go to their classroom, where Cassie's teacher, Daisy Crocker, gives them their textbooks, worn-out, outdated castoffs from the white school with a chart that says only white kids used these books up until they were in bad condition, indicating their future uses are intended only for black students. Crocker meets with Cassie's mother, Mary, who calmly glues {{a piece of paper}} over the chart containing the racist indicator in all the books. She hands them back to a dumbstruck Crocker. That Saturday their father, David Logan, comes home from his railroad job in Louisiana, bringing with him L.T. Morrison to assist in planting, farming, protection and other jobs, as Morrison was fired from the railroad for a fight that <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>white</b> men's fault.

25|$|Under Bradlee's leadership, The Washington Post took {{on major}} {{challenges}} during the Nixon administration. In 1971 The New York Times and the Post successfully challenged the government {{over the right}} to publish the Pentagon Papers. One year later, Bradlee backed reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as they probed the break-in at the Democratic National Committee Headquarters in the Watergate Hotel. According to Bradlee: You {{had a lot of}} Cuban or Spanish-speaking guys in masks and rubber gloves, with walkie-talkies, arrested in the Democratic National Committee Headquarters at 2 in the morning. What the hell were they in there for? What were they doing? The follow-up story was based primarily on their arraignment in court, and it was based on information given our police reporter, Al Lewis, by the cops, showing them an address book that one of the burglars had in his pocket, and in the address book was the name 'Hunt,' H-u-n-t, and the phone number <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> House phone number, which Al Lewis and every reporter worth his salt knew. And when, the next day, Woodward—this is probably Sunday or maybe Monday, because the burglary was Saturday morning early—called the number and asked to speak to Mr. Hunt, and the operator said, 'Well, he's not here now; he's over at' such-and-such a place, gave him another number, and Woodward called him up, and Hunt answered the phone, and Woodward said, 'We want to know why your name was in the address book of the Watergate burglars.' And there is this long, deathly hush, and Hunt said, 'Oh my God!' and hung up. So you had the White House. You have Hunt saying 'Oh my God!' At a later arraignment, one of the guys whispered to a judge. The judge said, 'What do you do?' and Woodward overheard the words 'CIA.' So if your interest isn't whetted by this time, you're not a journalist.Ensuing investigations of suspected cover-ups led inexorably to congressional committees, conflicting testimonies, and ultimately to the resignation of Richard Nixon in 1974. For decades, Bradlee was one of only four publicly known people who knew the true identity of press informant Deep Throat, the other three being Woodward, Bernstein, and Deep Throat himself, who later revealed himself to be Nixon's FBI associate director Mark Felt.|$|E

White oaks also thrive in moist lowlands and in upland topography, {{with the exception of}} extremely dry ridges with shallow soil.|$|E
