40|$|Fusarium {{head blight}} (FHB) of barley and wheat is a {{difficult}} disease to manage because {{of the complexity of}} the interactions. A serious problem associated with FHB is the accumulation of trichothecene mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON). Trichothecenes increase the virulence of the pathogen and reduce grain quality. A primary objective in our laboratory is to identify genes that reduce the impact of trichothecenes. Our laboratory has identified approximately 700 barley transcripts that respond to the invading pathogen and pathogenderived trichothecenes. In an effort to further understand the barley-F. graminearum interaction, a subset of 54 genes encoding transcription factors, regulatory proteins, UDP-glucosyltransferases, cytochrome-P 450 s, and proteins participating in ubiquitination and cell death were selected and tested for their response to DON treatment compared to mock <b>water</b> <b>inoculation</b> at 1, 6 and 12 hours after inoculation (hai).

40|$|In recent years, {{the medical}} {{profession}} has begun to collaborate more and more with lawyers {{in order to accomplish}} important health objectives for patients. That collaboration invites a revisioning of legal services delivery models and of public health constructs, leading to a concept we develop in this article, and call 2 ̆ 2 public health legal services. 2 ̆ 2 The phrase encompasses those legal services provided by non-government attorneys to low-income persons the outcomes of which when evaluated in the aggregate using traditional public health measures advance the public 2 ̆ 7 s health. This conception of public health legal services has emerged most prominently from innovative developments in Los Angeles (the HIV Legal Checkup model), Boston (Medical-Legal Partnership for Children) and New York (LegalHealth). It departs from the commonplace understanding about public health law as concerned with the exercise of the state 2 ̆ 7 s public health power. It extends that understanding to include the exercise of individual rights by private lawyers that also advances the public 2 ̆ 7 s health. Just as it was once discovered that communities need access to health information, clean <b>water,</b> <b>inoculation,</b> and regulation of hazardous activities and products as part of a comprehensive scheme for promoting and achieving health, so too the emerging vision suggests that community health promotion also requires affordable access to effective legal information and assistance. The idea of public health legal services offers a rich and powerful incentive for public and private agencies to increase free and subsidized legal services. At the same time, the legal services necessary from a public health perspective may not be the ones currently emphasized by providers. The vision of public health legal services in many ways favors prevention over crisis management, and therefore calls upon traditional legal services providers to rethink their customary resource allocation models. The vision may call for painful short-term choices between the new model and the always urgent demand for litigation and crisis-driven work.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to present a {{short-term}} plankton community toxicity test in laboratory microcosms, with which {{the effect of the}} test substance on species abundance and composition of the community is evaluated. This laboratory microcosm is an intermediate between single-species tests and outdoor mesocosm tests. The brominated flame retardant HBCDD was chosen as the reoccurring test substance in three experiments. It was applied at similar nominal exposure concentrations in toxicity experiments performed in test systems with different grades of complexity. One experiment was performed in an outdoor artificial pond in which cylinders were inserted to isolate replicate mesocosms. The other experiments were performed in a greenhouse environment in 10 L microcosms with sediment and water from a eutrophic lake and brackish water estuary. The short-time plankton community toxicity test proposed in this work was successful in detecting structural changes in plankton community composition due to exposure to anthropogenic chemicals. Several prerequisites for a sensitive community toxicity test were fulfilled. Ecological interactions, like competition and predation, were present and made detection of community level responses like secondary effects possible. The community which developed in the 10 L microcosms included many plankton species. This is important for a sensitive and representative evaluation of the toxic effect. The rich plankton community and a maintained balance between the autotroph and heterotroph communities {{during the course of the}} experiment were possible due to the sediment compartment. The sediment acts as a seed-bank from which plankton continuously hatch and enter the water volume. Lake <b>water</b> <b>inoculation</b> did not increase the species richness and made no change in plankton community composition. Using artificial water decreases both work-load and costs, considerably. Another important issue in the evaluation of toxicity tests is the variance of test endpoints between replicates. The minimal detectable difference from control (MDD) which mirrors the variability of test endpoints was compared between the mesocosm experiment and the two microcosm experiments. The three lowest MDD values were more or less in the same range between the experiments and ranged between 5 - 39 %. A possible increase in MDD was observed with increased experimental duration. An exposure period of 7 days is considered optimal in detecting clear community level responses at a minimum time. The effects of the test compounds in the three experiments were evaluated with population level and community level metrics. Judging from the results, no single toxic endpoint was found to be the most sensitive one. This stresses the importance of analysing both community and population metrics...|$|E

Biodegradation by the isolates of 1 ?g 1 - 1 of atrazine and 1 ?g 1 - 1 simazine in 100 ml MSM or reservoir surface water {{was assessed by}} comparison with non-inoculated controls. Extraction with dichloromethane recovered 100 ± 5 % of both s-triazines in non-inoculated MSM and reservoir surface water. Recovery was not reduced by adsorption of the s-triazines to bacteria, and no abiotic degradation occurred over the incubation periods. Isolate S 4 degraded 20 ± 7 % of the atrazine and isolates S 7 and S 8 degraded 40 ± 12 % of the simazine in MSM after 7 d at 30 °C. Decreasing the NH 4 NO 3 -N in the MSM from 35 mg 1 - 1 to 1 mg 1 - 1 stimulated biodegradation of atrazine by a fourth isolate (SL 3). At 10 °C isolates BI, SL 2, S 4 and S 6 each biodegraded 20 ± 1 % of the atrazine and isolate SL 2 biodegraded 30 ± 7 % of the simazine in surface water after 15 d. No biodegradation occurred in MSM at 10 °C. Granular activated carbon (GAC, 1 g 1 - 1) was added to surface water (10 ?g 1 - 1 atrazine and 10 ?g 1 - 1 simazine) which adsorbed 9. 7 ?gg- 1 s-triazine and provided sites for bacterial attachment. Recovery of adsorbed s-triazines (1, 10 and 40 ?g 1 - 1) by Soxhlet extraction of non-inoculated GAC was 97 ± 1. 5 %. Inoculation of s-triazine-degraders into surface water containing GAC reduced the solution concentration (0. 3 ?g 1 - 1 atrazine and 0. 3 ?g 1 - 1 simazine) by up to 86 ± 18 % (S 8) after incubation for 15 d at 10 °C. Biodegradation of 25 ?g 1 - 1 atrazine and 28 ?g 1 - 1 simazine in surface water amended with 0. 5 g 1 - 1 GAC and inoculated with isolate WT 1 was 50 ± 4 % (atrazine) and 38 ± 4 % (simazine) after 21 d at 10 °C.

40|$|Microbial {{communities}} {{associated with}} gastrointestinal tract of animals {{play a critical}} role in gut development, digestion and resistance to disease, thus the prospect of altering these communities beneficially by using probiotics is attractive. In terrestrial animals, the gut provides a stable, moist habitat in an otherwise moisture-limited environment, thus microbial communities tend to be very stable. In contrast, farmed aquatic animals reside within an environment that can support microbes in high densities, and as many marine animals drink continuously for osmoregulation, they are subjected to potential re-inoculation. Consequently, little is known of the stability of gut microbial communities in marine shrimp or whether it is possible to establish beneficial bacteria in the gut. The aims of this thesis were therefore to examine the midgut microbial community associated with farmed black tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon, and to investigate whether the introduction of potentially probiotic Bacillus could alter the species diversity or abundance of the present microbes. Using culture methods it was found that B. pumilus was able to transfer between animals via the water column and persisted in the midgut for at least 7 days, while B. subtilis was only recovered from animals directly fed the bacteria and persisted for less than 24 h in the midgut. V. parahaemolyticus, a known shrimp pathogen,remained in the tanks it was originally found in, and did not transfer via the water column to other tanks and is therefore tightly associated with its host. A bacterium with apparent probiotic qualities was isolated from control animals in the above study and identified as a strain of B. pumilus. Its safety for food animal use was confirmed due to the absence of B. cereus toxin genes, and the isolate’s pH and salt tolerances were investigated. Moreover, the isolate was highly inhibitory to crustacean pathogens in the family Vibrionaceae. Methods to investigate the gut microbiota using the full cycle 16 S rRNA methodology were optimized. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes designed specifically targeting B. pumilus, B. subtilis and B. licheniformis, commercially available probiotics, were validated for specificity and optimal hybridization conditions. For FISH analysis of bacteria in situ in histological sections of shrimp midgut trunks, fixation times in 4 % paraformaldehyde wereoptimizedfor bacterial RNA retention whilst maintaining tissue integrity. Due to the broad range of autofluorescence in the shrimp tissue, spectral imaging is required to adequately differentiate between host tissue and multiple bacterial probes. The richness and diversity of the midgut microbiota of animals treated with the novel strain of B. pumiluswere analyzed using 16 S rRNA gene clone libraries and FISH analysis of histological sections. It was confirmed that B. pumilus can enter the midgut via top-coated feed and through <b>water</b> <b>inoculation.</b> In the tanks that were treated with B. pumilus the proportion of Vibrio sp. in the microbial community decreased, however, only in the systems in which B. pumilus was recovered from the shrimp midgut did the proportion of pathogenic Vibrio species decrease. The application of the B. pumilus caused a shift in the shrimp midgut microbiota, but the community returned to its initial diversity over time. The midgut microbiota of P. monodon is relatively stable but can be adjusted using probiotics. The transience or residence of the probiotics is strain-specific and should be tested for any new strains before determining optimum application protocols. The methods designed in this study are applicable to future research in this field...|$|E

The mean values for grain number per ear (GN), 100 -grain weight (100 GW), ear weight (EW) and ear length (EL), spikelet number per ear (SN), andgrain yield per plant (GY) in the AM-inoculated cultivars were 31. 11 %, 5. 3 %, 39. 71 %, 21. 32 %, 19. 30 %, and 30. 8 % greater than the results from their non-inoculated counterparts. The resultsshowed that mycorrhizal inoculation enhanced chlorophyll (Chl) a, b and total Chl contents(13. 71 %, 33. 50 % and 17. 46 %, respectively) of flag leaves in all cultivars and at all <b>water</b> regimelevels. <b>Inoculation</b> with mycorrhizal fungus significantly increased (8. 67 % greater than that ofthe non-inoculated cultivars) carotenoid (Car) contents in the middle leaves. The differencebetween AM-treated and those plants which were not treated were not significant for day to earemergence (DEE). Higher levels for Shoot Water Contents (SWC) and lower levels of WaterSaturation Deficit (WSD) were observed in the AM-treated cultivars in comparison with thosethat were not treated...|$|R
40|$|Three {{independent}} {{studies were}} conducted in Australia and Spain to {{examine the effect of}} water and temperature stress on the development of Eutypa dieback of grapevines. In Adelaide, South Australia, ‘Red Grenache’ vines in pots were inoculated with Eutypa lata and subjected to various temperature and soil water regimes, then assessed for foliar symptoms, wood staining and colonization by the fungus. Vines subjected to a combination of heat or cold plus low or high soil moisture displayed more severe foliar symptoms, the most severe occurring on vines subjected to the hottest (30 °C) and wettest (20 – 40 % soil water content) conditions. Wood staining was not related to foliar symptom severity or to the temperature and moisture combination. Furthermore, there was no relationship between staining and mycelial growth, indicating that staining may not be an accurate reflection of the spread of E. lata. In Cabrils, Spain, ‘Tempranillo’ vines were subjected to water stress in pots and showed a significant reduction in shoot diameter growth, stomatal conductance and leaf <b>water</b> potential. <b>Inoculation</b> with E. lata also decreased the leaf water potential of stressed vines. Wood staining in inoculated vines was similar irrespective of watering treatment. Further investigations are needed to elucidate the relationship between stress and growth of E. lata in infected vines. Field experiments in two climatically different regions (Barossa Valley and Riverland) of South Australia suggested that water-stressed vines in a warm, dry environment may be more susceptible to infection of pruning wounds by E. lata than vines receiving standard watering. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevailing}} {{paradigm in}} aquatic science is that microbial methanogenesis happens primarily in anoxic environments. Here, we used multiple complementary approaches {{to show that}} microbial methane production could and did occur in the well-oxygenated water column of an oligotrophic lake (Lake Stechlin, Germany). Oversaturation of methane was repeatedly recorded in the well-oxygenated upper 10 m of the water column, and the methane maxima coincided with oxygen oversaturation at 6 m. Laboratory incubations of unamended epilimnetic lake <b>water</b> and <b>inoculations</b> of photoautotrophs with a lake-enrichment culture both led to methane production even {{in the presence of}} oxygen, and the production was not affected by the addition of inorganic phosphate or methylated compounds. Methane production was also detected by in-lake incubations of lake water, and the highest production rate was 1. 8 – 2. 4 nM⋅h− 1 at 6 m, which could explain 33 – 44 % of the observed ambient methane accumulation in the same month. Temporal and spatial uncoupling between methanogenesis and methanotrophy was supported by field and laboratory measurements, which also helped explain the oversaturation of methane in the upper water column. Potentially methanogenic Archaea were detected in situ in the oxygenated, methane-rich epilimnion, and their attachment to photoautotrophs might allow for anaerobic growth and direct transfer of substrates for methane production. Specific PCR on mRNA of the methyl coenzyme M reductase A gene revealed active methanogenesis. Microbial methane production in oxygenated water represents a hitherto overlooked source of methane and can be important for carbon cycling in the aquatic environments and water to air methane flux...|$|R

Darkland) grown in four {{commercial}} fi region of Saudi Arabia were observed with numerous lesions typical of bacterial leaf spot. Lesions were irregular, Disease incidence approached 30 %. Bacteria were isolated by cutting lesions into small (1 mm) pieces and soaki water. The resulting suspensions were streaked onto sucrose peptone agar and King's medium B. Three isolates for further study were aerobic, Gram-negative, non-spore-forming rods. All isolates including a hypersensitive re soft rot of potato tubers, and were negative for levanoxidase, and arginine dihydrolase (Lelliot & Stead, 1987). From D-glucose, mannitol and sorbitol, but not from D-arabinose, L-rhmnose, or sucrose; starch was not hydrooxidative, nitrates were not reduced to nitrites, gelatin was hydrolysed. Isolates were catalase positive and unab 5 % NaCl. On this basis isolates were identified as Pseudomonas viridiflava. The identity of bacterial strains was c (carbon source utilization at 37 ˚C), with a similarity index of 0. 75. Pathogenicity tests were performed by sprayil lettuce plants (cv.

40|$|The {{ubiquitous}} genus Alternaria {{contains many}} {{species that are}} able to invade cereals, oleaginous plants and other crops. Alternaria alternata {{is considered one of the}} most important species and can produce several mycotoxins under favourable conditions of temperature and humidity, including the economically important toxins: alternariol (AOH) and alternariol monomethyl ether (AME). The aim of this study was to evaluate the radio-sensitivity of Alternaria alternata spores through different gamma radiation doses. A. alternata growth and the production of AOH and AME were then analyzed. After fungal irradiation with 2 kGy, 5 kGy and 7 kGy, the spores were suspended with sterile distilled <b>water</b> followed by <b>inoculation</b> on wheat grains. The count of the colony-forming units per gram (CFU/g) was performed using Dichloran Rose Bengal Chloramphenicol (DRBC) and Dichloran Chloramphenicol Agar Malt Extract (DCMA); AOH and AME were analyzed using Liquid Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometer (LC-MS). Results showed that fungal growth and toxin production increased with the increase of radiation dosage. The implications of these findings in relation to the resistance of A. alternata spores to gamma irradiation are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Candida albican s is a dimorphic fungus {{that is part}} of the {{commensal}} {{microbial flora}} of the oral cavity. When the host immune defenses are impaired or when the normal microbial flora is disturbed, C. albicans triggers recurrent infections of the oral mucosa and tongue. Recently, we produced NOD/SCID. e 2 f 1 -/- mice that show hyposalivation, decrease of salivary protein flow, lack IgA and IgG in saliva, and have decreased NK cells. Our objective was to characterize C. albicans infection and biofilm formation in mice. Methods NOD/SCID. e 2 f 1 -/- mice were used as an animal model for C. albicans infection. C. albicans yeast and hyphal forms solutions were introduced in the oral cavity after disinfection by Chlorhexidine. Results The numbers of C. albicans colonized and decreased in a time-dependent manner in NOD/SCID. e 2 f 1 +/+ after inoculation. However, the colonization levels were higher in NOD/SCID. e 2 f 1 +/+ than NOD/SCID. e 2 f 1 -/- mice. In the mice fed 1 % sucrose <b>water</b> before <b>inoculation,</b> C. albicans sample was highly contaminated by indigenous microorganisms in the oral cavity; and was not in the mice fed no sucrose water. The colonization of C. albicans was not influenced by the contamination of indigenous microorganisms. The hyphal form of C. albicans restricted the restoration of indigenous microorganisms. The decreased saliva in NOD/SCID. e 2 f 1 -/- did not increase the colonization of C. albicans in comparison to NOD/SCID. e 2 f 1 +/+ mice. We suggest that the receptor in saliva to C. albicans may not be sufficiently provided in the oral cavity of NOD/SCID. e 2 f 1 -/- mice. Conclusion The saliva protein flow may be very important for C. albicans initial colonization, where the indigenous microorganisms do not affect colonization in the oral cavity. </p...|$|R

Fifteen-centimeter-diam plastic pots were filled with 1  kg autoclaved mixed soil with loamy sand-clay (1 : 1  v/v). One-month-old tomato seedlings of Solanum lycopersicum were transplanted {{to the center of}} each pot (one seedling per pot). Three days after transplantation, the soil was drenched with 10  ml suspension (2 [*]×[*] 106  cfu ml−[*] 1) of actively growing cultures of B. amyloliquefaciens alone, L. sphaericus alone, B. amyloliquefaciens and L. sphaericus in combination, and Bas 8 as one-time drench simultaneously with 2000 freshly hatched second-stage juveniles of M. incognita in three holes around the root of each seedling. Each treatment was replicated five times. Pots inoculated with nematode only without bacteria served as control. Plants were <b>watered</b> slightly after <b>inoculation</b> and thereafter, whenever required. The experiment was set in a complete randomized design on the greenhouse bench at 35  °C. The experiment was terminated 60  days after nematode inoculation. Data on nematode reproduction and plant growth parameters were recorded and were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) and means compared according to Duncan’s multiple range test (Duncan 1955).|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the study}} was to examine the {{hypothesis}} proposed by Evans et al. [2003. Hazards of healthy living: bottled water and salad vegetables as risk factors for Campylobacter infection. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 9 (10), 1219 – 1225] that mineral bottled water accidentally contaminated by Campylobacter jejuni would represent a risk factor for Campylobacter infection. Culturability of C. jejuni cells inoculated in low- and high-mineral bottled water during storage at 4 1 C in the dark was performed by surface plating and modelled using theWeibull model. The loss of C. jejuni culturability observed in all conditions tested was shown to be dependent on strain, preculture condition and <b>water</b> composition. Following <b>inoculation</b> of C. jejuni, the rapid loss of culturability was not correlated to complete cell death as the passage into embryonated eggs enabled recovery of cells from the viable but non-culturable state. In conclusion, the sanitary risk associated with contaminated bottled water cannot be excluded although it is presumably low. Culture conditions, strain and water type must be taken into account in the evaluation of the risk factors as they influence significantly Campylobacter survival in water...|$|R
40|$|Inoculation {{of forest}} {{seedlings}} with mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobacteria {{can improve the}} morphological and physiological qualities of plants, especially those used for regeneration of arid areas. In this paper, under standard nursery conditions, Aleppo pine seedlings were inoculated with Pseudomonas fluorescens CECT 5281 rhizobacteria. Some of these seedlings were also inoculated with the ectomycorrhizal fungus Pisolithus tinctorius. Five months after the inoculations, we examined the growth, water parameters (osmotic potential at full turgor [Ψπfull], osmotic potential at zero turgor [Ψπ 0], and the tissue modulus of elasticity near full turgor [Emax]), mycorrhizal colonisation, and concentration of macronutrients (N, P, K, Ca and Mg) in the seedlings. Subsequently, a trial was conducted to assess the root growth potential. P. fluorescens CECT 5281 decreased the cellular osmotic potential of P. halepensis seedlings but increased its elasticity. P. tinctorius + P. fluorescens caused osmotic adjustment at zero turgor and increased tissue elasticity, which improved tolerance to <b>water</b> stress. All <b>inoculations</b> improved the growth and nutrition of the seedlings but caused non-significant effects on root growth potential. The co-inoculation Pisolithus tinctorius + Pseudomonas fluorescens at the nursery may be a suitable technique for producing improved seedling material for restoration purposes...|$|R
