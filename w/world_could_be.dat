5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Nemo sprang from multiple experiences, {{going back to}} director Andrew Stanton's childhood, when he loved going to the dentist to see the fish tank, assuming that the fish were from the ocean and wanted to go home. In 1992, shortly after his son was born, {{he and his family}} took a trip to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (which was called Marine World at the time). There, after seeing the shark tube and various exhibits, he felt that the underwater <b>world</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> done beautifully in computer animation. Later, in 1997, he took his son for a walk in the park, but realized that he was overprotecting him and lost an opportunity to have a father-son experience that day.|$|E

25|$|The great {{influence}} of the 17th century was the French philosopher, René Descartes (1596–1650), whose Meditations (1641) informed attitudes about animals well into the 20th century.

25|$|The Theodicy {{tries to}} justify the {{apparent}} imperfections of the world by claiming that it is optimal among all possible worlds.

In effect, apparent flaws that can be identified in this world must exist in every possible world, because otherwise God would have chosen to create the world that excluded those flaws.|$|E
25|$|In 1940, Tordoff {{enrolled}} at Cornell University, {{where he found}} that {{his interest in the}} natural <b>world</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> pursued in a formal setting. While he was there, he met Robert M. Mengel (his lifelong best friend, later editor of the Auk), who encouraged his interest in ornithology, as did one of his professors, Arthur Augustus Allen. His studies were interrupted by his military service during World War II, although he managed to complete some courses while in the military. After the war, Tordoff resumed his studies and in 1946 he graduated with a B.A. degree in zoology. In graduate school at the University of Michigan from 1947 to 1950 he studied ornithology under Josselyn Van Tyne and George Miksch Sutton, earning a Ph.D. with a thesis on the systematics of finches.|$|E
25|$|By November 2014, {{the game}} was {{entering}} {{the final stages of}} production. While Nintendo had decided not to create an official website at that point, Monolith Soft decided to create their own website for the game. While they initially thought Nintendo would object, they were allowed to go ahead with creating and maintaining the website. Monolith Soft also created an official Twitter account for the game alongside the new website. Xenoblade Chronicles X was published in Japan by Nintendo on April 29, 2015. The Japanese version came with standard and a hardware bundle featuring a version of the game with a reversible cover, black Wii U console and gamepad, and an artbook. Alongside the game's release, downloadable content (DLC) was made available for purchase, featuring four new characters with accompanying stories split between three quests, and optional data packs to speed loading times. The data packs were provided so that when flying Skells portions of the <b>world</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> loaded from storage to make for a smoother playing experience.|$|E

Unlike most other 4X games, Pax had much more complex solar systems, including moving planets, their moons, and a habitable temperature zone that varied depending on the star and the races preferences.|$|R

500|$|Wordless novel scholar David Beronä saw {{the work}} as a {{catalogue}} of human activity, and in this regard compared it to Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass and Allen Ginsberg's Howl. [...] Austrian writer Stefan Zweig remarked, [...] "If everything were to perish, all the books, monuments, photographs and memoirs, and only the woodcuts that [...] has executed in ten years were spared, our whole present-day <b>world</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> reconstructed from them." [...] Critic Chris Lanier attributes the protagonist's appeal to readers to Masereel's avoiding a preaching tone in the work; [...] "rather", Lanier states, [...] "he gives us a story as a device through which we can examine ourselves". [...] This openness in the images invites individual interpretation, according to Beronä.|$|E
500|$|Shilts {{declared}} while {{promoting the}} book in Australia in 1988 that AIDS in the western <b>world</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> eradicated, and by 1994, [...] "AIDS could be as manageable as diabetes". However, in reference to Africa, Shilts noted, [...] "At this point it's inconceivable {{that there will be}} an AIDS-free world in Central Africa, as we're looking at a death rate on the scale of the Holocaust." [...] Shilts gave an interview in 1991 where he noticed, [...] "the stellar AIDS reporters in the early years...the people who did the best job—and the reporters who wanted to cover AIDS but their male editors wouldn't let them—tended to be women", and made a connection that if more women were allowed to write about the epidemic, media coverage would have been vastly different.|$|E

(Fact: In 2011, pretty much any song in the <b>world</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> made infinitely better by the addition of a Nicki Minaj verse.)

500|$|Reports of {{a planned}} sequel of Ra.One began {{surfacing}} prior to the film's release, though the extent of real progress on the sequel is unknown. Both Khan and Sinha admitted to formulating plans for a sequel, though the former noted {{that it would be}} [...] "presumptuous" [...] to start the sequel before the first film's release. Khan later refuted the speculations, saying that a sequel was unlikely due to his other commitments. After Ra.One won a National Award, an [...] "overjoyed" [...] Khan said that the film's <b>world</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> further explored.

500|$|Fouad Ajami criticised Aflaq {{for a lack}} of real substance, stating, [...] "Nearly {{three hundred}} pages of text yield no insight, on his part, into what went wrong and what needed to be done; there is only the visible infatuation with words" [...] and [...] "Aflaq summons the party to renounce power and go back to its 'pure essence'". There is some truth in this critique. Aflaq spent much time and energy writing optimistically about the future, and the past, of the Arab Nation, and of how the Arab <b>World</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> unified. As Kanan Makiya, the author of Republic of Fear: The Politics of Modern Iraq, notes: for [...] "Aflaq, reality is {{confined}} to the inner world of the party." [...] In contrast to other philosophers, such as Karl Marx or John Locke, Aflaq's ideological view of the world makes no clear stand on the materialistic or socioeconomic behavior of humanity. While other philosophers make distinctions between what is real and what is not real, that is between prescriptive and descriptive analysis, [...] Aflaq did not as a rule define what is and what ought to be. [...] In his thought both are molded into the same category: that which is attainable.|$|E
500|$|For XV, {{the battle}} system was dubbed the Active Cross Battle system. Noctis was made the only player-controlled character, {{with the others}} being relegated to command {{functions}} governed by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). The team experimented with a multi-character battle system, but eventually decided that it presented too many development difficulties. Noctis' weapons were to be arranged in a deck, and contextually activated in combat. Later, this was changed so that weapon-switching could be done freely during battle, with special attacks using the standard weapons unless others were in place. Instead of a multi-button combo system, combat became focused on single-button combat tied to timed attacks and contextually activated special abilities, in addition to co-op attacks triggered {{with other members of}} the party. One ability that was carried over from Versus XIII to XV was Noctis's Limit Break [...] "Armiger", where he summoned multiple weapons into battle to attack and defend; this was initially seen in the original trailer for XV, and later in both the demo and the final game. Noctis was to have been the only character in the world of XV to wield magic, but as this would not have worked from a gameplay perspective, the team created a story-related pretext that allowed other characters to wield magic. After the demo's release, the Cross-Link system was improved and other systems were put into place. Polishing work on the game continued up until the final version was released. The navigation was described after its 2014 re-reveal as [...] "open world": Tabata later clarified that while character progression was driven by the story, the various areas within the <b>world</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> freely explored by players. He also wished for a fusion of gameplay and story similar to The Last of Us.|$|E
