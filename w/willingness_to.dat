In this paper we use 1980 census data to measure the impact of the age structure and real income per household on the <b>willingness</b> of households <b>to</b> pay for a constant quality house.

Even though the analogy to a competitive market has been emphasised by Lindahl himself his approach does not directly explain the normative ideas, which are behind this concept. In the present paper we therefore show how the Lindahl equilibrium can be deduced from some simple equity axioms that in particular {{are related to the}} equal sacrifice principle and a non-envy postulate as norms for distributional equity. Fairness among agents with different preferences is taken into account by considering their marginal <b>willingnesses</b> <b>to</b> pay as virtual prices. In this way it might also become more understandable why the Lindahl solution can be perceived as an outcome of fair cooperation. public goods, Lindahl equilibrium, fairness, equity...|$|R
