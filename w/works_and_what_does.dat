This book provided a project management framework illustrating twenty-four project management rules.

50|$|Searching for {{themes and}} {{considering}} what <b>works</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> not work within themes enables {{the researcher to}} begin the analysis of potential codes. In this phase, {{it is important to}} begin by examining how codes combine to form over-reaching themes in the data. At this point, researchers have a list of themes and begin to focus on broader patterns in the data, combining coded data with proposed themes. Researchers also begin considering how relationships are formed between codes and themes and between different levels of existing themes. It may be helpful to use visual models to sort codes into the potential themes.|$|E

The evidence-based approach that is currently practiced in medicine is suggested to be merged with the practice-based medicine to achieve better outcomes for patients. As CEO of California-based cognitive computing firm Apixio, Darren Schutle, explains that the care can be better fitted to the patient if the data could be collected from various medical records, merged, and analyzed. Further, the combination of similar profiles can serve as a basis for personalized medicine pointing to what <b>works</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> not for certain condition (Marr, 2016).|$|E

He has studied microeconomic issues of financial decision-making, specifically employing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to examine what <b>works</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> not and why with respect to interventions and businesses intended to address problems in society. Internationally, he focuses on microfinance, and domestically he focuses on voting, charitable giving, and commitment contracts. In microfinance, Karlan has studied the following topics: interest rate policy, credit evaluation and scoring policies, entrepreneurship training, group versus individual liability, savings product design, credit with education, and impact from increased access to credit and savings. His work on savings and health typically uses insights from psychology and behavioral economics to design and test specialized products.|$|E

The document appears as if it will be updated {{on a regular basis}} as more questions are answered over time.On December 1, 2011, Carrier IQ issued a [...] "clarification" [...] to its November 23 statements: [...] "While a few individuals have identified that {{there is a great deal}} of information available to the Carrier IQ software inside the handset, our software does not record, store or transmit the contents of SMS messages, email, photographs, audio or video. For example, we understand whether an SMS was sent accurately, but do not record or transmit the content of the SMS. We know which applications are draining your battery, but do not capture the screen... As a condition of its contracts with operators, Carrier IQ operates exclusively within that framework and under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction. The data we gather is transmitted over an encrypted channel and secured within our customers’ networks or in our audited and customer-approved facilities... Carrier IQ acts as an agent for the operators. Each implementation is different and the diagnostic information actually gathered is determined by our customers - the mobile operators. Carrier IQ does not gather any other data from devices.Carrier IQ is the consumer advocate to the mobile operator, explaining what <b>works</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>does</b> not work. Three of the main complaints we hear from mobile device users are (1) dropped calls, (2) poor customer service, and (3) having to constantly recharge the device. Our software allows operators to figure out why problems are occurring, why calls are dropped, and how to extend the life of the battery. When a user calls to complain about a problem, our software helps operators’ customer service to more quickly identify the specific issue with the phone." ...|$|E
