5|$|Although clepsydrae {{were more}} useful than sundials—they {{could be used}} indoors, during the night, and also <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> was cloudy—they were not as {{accurate}}; the Greeks, therefore, sought a way to improve their water clocks. Although still not as accurate as sundials, Greek water clocks became more accurate around 325, and they were adapted to have a face with an hour hand, making {{the reading of the}} clock more precise and convenient. One of the more common problems in most types of clepsydrae was caused by water pressure: when the container holding the water was full, the increased pressure caused the water to flow more rapidly. This problem was addressed by Greek and Roman horologists beginning in 100, and improvements continued {{to be made in the}} following centuries. To counteract the increased water flow, the clock's water containers—usually bowls or jugs—were given a conical shape; positioned with the wide end up, a greater amount of water had to flow out in order to drop the same distance as when the water was lower in the cone. Along with this improvement, clocks were constructed more elegantly in this period, with hours marked by gongs, doors opening to miniature figurines, bells, or moving mechanisms. There were some remaining problems, however, which were never solved, such as the effect of temperature. Water flows more slowly when cold, or may even freeze.|$|E

In 1976 the American writer Gore Vidal (who lived in La Rondinaia, a nearby house built by Lucy Beckett, from 1972 to 2004) wrote of Villa Cimbrone: Twenty five years ago I was asked by an American {{magazine}} what was the most beautiful place that I had ever seen in all my travels and I said the view from the belvedere of the Villa Cimbrone on a bright winter's day <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> and the sea were each so vividly blue that it was not possible to tell one from the other.|$|E
25|$|The maximum {{precipitation}} on {{the mountain}} occurs during the mid-March to June wet season, but the level of perception can vary greatly from year to year. During the wet seasons it is overcast almost continually. Half of the annual rainfall is over the long rains March to June, with {{a third of the}} total in the October to December short rains wet season. In both the wet and dry seasons the wettest location {{on the mountain}} are the south-east slopes. The south-eastern maximum is due to the direction of the predominant winds. The maximum in the west is mainly due to the effects of the sun <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> is clear, due to anabatic upwelling of air in the valleys bringing cloud up the mountain by the early afternoon. Without this effect this area would be expected to be in a rain shadow.|$|E
25|$|Temperature {{variations}} {{are closely}} correlated with direct sunlight. The sun quickly warms {{the ground by}} a few degrees, which in turn warms the air close to the ground. This air cools to reach equilibrium with the mean air temperature very quickly <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> becomes overcast. The layer of air within half a metre of {{the ground in the}} valleys also exhibit different temperatures at night to the air layer above it. During the clear nights of the dry season, the ground cools quickly cooling the air next to it. This leads to katabatic winds from the ridges into the valleys resulting in the valley bottoms being colder than the higher ridges flanking them. Baker found that the Teleki valley was regularly 2°C colder at night than the surrounding ridges. This has forced plants such as the senecios and lobellias to be tall to avoid key parts freezing, as freezing is lethal for plants.|$|E

500|$|A {{few days}} after the Squadron had moved to Lille/Vendeville, it was called upon to provide a special patrol of four {{aircraft}} as air cover for the Armistice Day ceremonies being held in Paris; no German intruders attempted to intervene. Later in the month, there was an accident at base that took the lives of two pilots who had recently joined the Cougars. F/Os H. Connelly and J.

With him were three officers and two airmen, all going on leave. Near Wrotham, Kent, the aircraft crashed and only one of its occupants survived. Killed with S/L Fulton were his navigator F/O A.R. Ayton (RAF), who had accompanied him on posting to the Cougars in October, F/L F.G. Thomson, DFC (RAF), who had arrived late in November to begin a second tour, and LACs E. Wahlers and R. Seefried. F/O W. Rumbold, another RAF navigator, was seriously injured; he had been with the Squadron for two months. The squadron was disbanded {{at the end of the}} war on 9 June 1945.|$|E

It is also surrounded by five lakes: Lake Kawaguchi, Lake Yamanaka, Lake Sai, Lake Motosu and Lake Shōji. They, and nearby Lake Ashi, provide views of the mountain.

Two battalions of GM 33 were posted to push eastwards from Dong Hene; {{the other two}} were tasked to thrust east from Kengkok. The probing columns promptly came under communist heavy weapons fire. Platoon-sized raids on Dong Hene also began. On 17 May 1971, the RLA vehicles withdrew westward down Route 9. They ran into a PAVN ambush three kilometers out, which disabled both Chaffee tanks and a truck, stopping the convoy in its tracks. The blocked convoy was overrun two hours later. An attack on GM 33 followed.

2500|$|For FM {{broadcasting}} (and the {{few remaining}} low-band TV stations), weather is the primary cause for changes in VHF propagation, along with some diurnal changes <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> is mostly without cloud cover. [...] These changes are most obvious during temperature inversions, {{such as in the}} late-night and early-morning hours when it is clear, allowing the ground and the air near it to cool more rapidly. [...] This not only causes dew, frost, or fog, but also causes a slight [...] "drag" [...] {{on the bottom of the}} radio waves, bending the signals down such that they can follow the Earth's curvature over the normal radio horizon. [...] The result is typically several stations being heard from another media market [...] usually a neighboring one, but sometimes ones from a few hundred kilometers away. [...] Ice storms are also the result of inversions, but these normally cause more scattered omnidirection propagation, resulting mainly in interference, [...] often among weather radio stations. [...] In late spring and early summer, a combination of other atmospheric factors can occasionally cause skips that duct high-power signals to places well over 1000km away.|$|E
