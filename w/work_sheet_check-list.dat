This research was did in study program of biology and 5 senior high school Pekanbaru on july until august 2015. Subjects of research were basic competencies 3. 7 and 3. 8 on digestion system and respiratory systemsubjects. This research was started by analyzing the curriculum, syllabus, and <b>work</b> <b>sheets</b> that arranged by Musyawarah Guru Mata Pelajaran (MGMP). And then making the new design of the <b>work</b> <b>sheets</b> according to scientific approach they are 3 lecturers and 2 teachers.

40|$|The {{objective}} of physic learning {{as a process}} is to improve studentâ€™s thinking ability. To achieve studentâ€™s thinking skill in learning, a method and learning source are needed to develop studentâ€™s thinking skill. The use of learning source based on science generic skill (or KGS) is very needed in Ohmâ€™s Law and Kirchoffâ€™s First Law materials, because in these materials {{students are able to}} conduct generic skills such as direct observation, indirect observation, awareness about scale, mathematic modeling, and logical inference. These skills are able to apply by conducting a practicum using studentâ€™s <b>work</b> <b>sheet</b> (or LKS) based on science generic skill (or KGS) that is able to develop studentâ€™s thinking skill in Ohmâ€™s Law and Kirchoffâ€™s First Law materials. This development research used development model adapted from Suyanto with the following stages: 1) need assessment, 2) resource identification, 3) product specification identification, 4) product development, 5) internal test, 6) external test, and 7) production.

This clinical report describes serial and inhibitive casts and introduces a precasting <b>work</b> <b>sheet</b> that promotes the selection of appropriate casting patients and necessary planning. The <b>work</b> <b>sheet</b> guides the therapist through an assessment of patient data relevant to casting, including passive range of motion, postural tone and abnormal reflexes, and voluntary movement.

The selected texts all feature a child protagonist in a difficult life situation with regards to their immediate or wider family circle. The vantage point was primarily the ouvre of M. Zinnerová, particularly the titles Indiáni z Větrova ('The Indians from Větrov'), Tajemství proutěného košíku ('The Secret of the Woven Basket'), and Kde padají hvězdy ('Where Stars Fall'). The dissertation is divided into a theoretical and a practical part. The theoretical part contains first {{a description of the}} general characteristics of narrative prose from the life of children with an emphasis on the issues of personal and social education. Furthermore, it focuses in detail on the utilisation of prose in literary education in primary schools, the methodology and different types of literary analysis and the insertion of all these activities into the relevant curriculum. The practical part deals with concrete classical and activising methods of application with regards to select texts from M. Zinnerová's works. The aim of the dissertation was to create <b>work</b> <b>sheets</b> based on excerpts from the prose of this author and to test them in practice in the environment of an after-school care centre where primary school children were to engage with them.
