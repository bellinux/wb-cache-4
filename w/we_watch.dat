5|$|Stefano Ghislotti {{wrote an}} article in Film Anthology which {{discusses}} how Nolan provides the viewer with the clues necessary to decode the sujet as <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> and {{help us understand the}} fabula from it. The color sequences include a brief overlap to help clue the audience into {{the fact that they are}} being presented in reverse order. The purpose of the fragmented reverse sequencing is to force the audience into a sympathetic experience of Leonard's defective ability to create new long-term memories, where prior events are not recalled, since the audience has yet to see them.|$|E

25|$|A {{peculiarity}} of the masnavi of the Ottoman {{period is}} that they almost always possess, beneath the literal meaning, a subtle spiritual signification. Many poems, of Mesnevi of Mevlana and the Divan of Aşık Paşha examples of confessedly religious, moral, or mystic but a much larger number are allegorical. To this latter class belong almost all the long romantic mesnevis of the Persian and mid Ottoman poets; in {{the stories of the}} loves of Leyla and Mecnun, Yusuf and Zuleykha, Kusrev and Shavin, Suleyman and Ebsal, and a hundred of like kind, can see pictured, if we look beneath the surface, the soul of man for God, or the yearning of the human heart after heavenly light and wisdom. There is not a character introduced into those romances but represents the passion not an incident but has some spiritual meaning. In the history of Iskender, or Alexander, <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> the noble human soul in its struggles against the powers of this world, and, when aided by God and guided by the heavenly wisdom of righteous teachers, its ultimate victory over every earthly passion, and its attainment of that point of divine serenity whence it can look calmly down on all sublunary things.|$|E

60|$|So <b>we</b> <b>watched</b> {{the dragon}} leap and twist {{and get the}} knight by the leg: and then perish. <b>We</b> <b>watched</b> the knights burst into the castle. <b>We</b> <b>watched</b> the {{wonderful}} armour-clashing embraces of the delivered knights, Orlando and his bosom friend and the little dwarf, clashing their armoured breasts to the breasts of their brothers and deliverers. <b>We</b> <b>watched</b> the would-be tears flow.--And then the statue of the witch suddenly go up in flames, at which a roar of exultation from the boys. Then it was over. The theatre was empty in a moment, but the proprietors {{and the two men}} who sat near us would not let us go. We must wait for the next performance.|$|R

500|$|The {{shifting}} {{point of}} view coincides with the movie's subject matter: filmmaking. The film begins {{with the end of}} a play, and the story explores the process of creation. This metanarrative approach is emphasized by the camera's focus in the first scene on Barton (who is mouthing the words spoken by actors offscreen), not on the play he is watching. As Rowell says: [...] "hough we listen to one scene, <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> another.... The separation of sound and picture shows a crucial dichotomy between two 'views' of artifice: the world created by the protagonist (his play) and the world outside it (what goes into creating a performance)".|$|E
500|$|Asked in a {{separate}} interview about the overall process of composing the music {{and how it is}} used in the episode, Djawadi revealed [...] "I sit with David and Dan and we do what's called a spotting session where <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> the entire episode and then discuss when music should start and stop. Everybody's very involved with that. And it constantly gets played with. What I love about Game of Thrones is that the positioning of the music is so well done, because it's not overdone. When the music cuts in, it really has something to say." [...] "Light of the Seven" [...] reached No. 1 on Billboard's Spotify Viral 50 chart on its release.|$|E
500|$|For {{the timing}} of {{introducing}} the new characters, the showrunners decided to introduce the Punisher immediately and hold back on Elektra briefly, with Ramirez explaining that [...] "one of the pitfalls when we have this many great characters to play with is wanting to throw them at the wall", but {{it was important to}} take the time to introduce the new characters properly to the audience, particularly to the people who weren't already familiar with them. Elaborating on the aim to keep the story focused on Murdock, Petrie revealed that the writers would often come up with [...] "amazing stuff" [...] for the season, but then realize that they had forgotten about Murdock and had to [...] "completely turn it over and look at how this affects Matt and filter it through that prism." [...] Ramirez added,It could easily become The Punisher story or the Elektra story that Matt cameos in, and not vice versa. So, we built it like a Matt story, in terms of what we wanted to put him through, where we wanted to get him, by the end of the season, and what we wanted to have him learn about himself, and we used an Elektra and Frank story throughout, to get him there... we talked about when <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> shows in 13 episode stretches, how do <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> them? What is an exciting structure that we would like to think about here? Do we divide it right down the middle? Do we do a three-act structure?...If you were to sit and watch 13 episodes, you would absolutely feel a structure, much like in the comics. That’s what we did this season.|$|E

500|$|At the exhibition, {{reaction}} among observers was mixed. Some {{doubted the}} aircraft would fly, {{and focused on}} more likely machines such as the Sloan, the Voisin, or Louis Paulhan's design. Others gave special notice to the Coandă-1910, calling it original and ingenious. The reporter from La Technique Aeronautique wrote, [...] "In the absence of definitive trials, permitting the precise yield of this machine, it is without doubt premature to say it will supersede the propeller... the tentative is interesting and <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> it closely." [...] The official exhibition report ignored the turbo-propulseur engine and instead described Coandă's novel wing design, and the unusual empennage. On 15 November 1910, L'Aérophile wrote that if the machine were ever to develop as the inventor hoped, it would be [...] "a beautiful dream".|$|E
500|$|British critic Leslie Halliwell {{states the}} film's {{influence}} as [...] "it {{led directly to}} all the kaleidoscopic swinging London spy thrillers and comedies of the later sixties". In particular, the visuals and storyline are credited with inspiring The Monkees' television series. The [...] "Can't Buy Me Love" [...] segment borrowed stylistically from Richard Lester's earlier The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film, {{and it is this}} segment, in particular using the contemporary technique of cutting the images to the beat of the music, which has been cited as a precursor of modern music videos. Roger Ebert goes even further, crediting Lester for a more pervasive influence, even constructing [...] "a new grammar": [...] "he influenced many other films. Today when <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> TV and see quick cutting, hand-held cameras, interviews conducted on the run with moving targets, quickly intercut snatches of dialogue, music under documentary action and all the other trademarks of the modern style, we are looking at the children of A Hard Day's Night". In an interview for the DVD re-release of A Hard Day's Night, Lester said he had been labelled the father of MTV and had jokingly responded by asking for a paternity test.|$|E
500|$|TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode 4 out of 5 stars, writing [...] "Simpsons Season 26 starts {{off with a}} bang, with plenty of laughs {{and even a few}} sentimental moments". Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 4 stars out of 5, commenting 'Clown in the Dumps' may not be {{considered}} a classic episode now, but after a few years when <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> it again on syndication, probably next year on FXX, it will grow in stature. It is a heartfelt episode that does bring on the laughs. The sadness of the episode to me was Jackie Mason's voice, which sounds very tired. Paste gave the episode a rating of 7.1, concluding These days, The Simpsons can be hit or miss, and there was nothing to guarantee success from 'Clown in the Dumps'. However, even if the character death was perfunctory, and Rabbi Krustofski has made only a handful of appearances in over 550 episodes, it was still a funny, solid half hour of television. Nothing special—really, it was just another Krusty episode, and not the best Krusty episode. Nevertheless, the 26th season of The Simpsons has started out on somewhat of a high note. The good times keep on rolling for Matt Groening's deathless creation.|$|E

2500|$|In 1973, {{the story}} [...] "Flash Crowd" [...] by Larry Niven {{described}} a concept similar to flash mobs. With {{the invention of}} popular and very inexpensive teleportation, an argument at a shopping mall—which happens to be covered by a news crew—quickly swells into a riot. In the story, broadcast coverage attracts the attention of other people, who use the widely available technology of the teleportation booth to swarm first that event—thus intensifying the riot—and then other events as they happen. Commenting on the social impact of such mobs, one character (articulating the police view) says, [...] "We call them flash crowds, and <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> for them." [...] In related short stories, they are named as a prime location for illegal activities (such as pickpocketing and looting) to take place.|$|E
2500|$|The {{story was}} brought to {{widespread}} public attention by popular writer Dave Barry in his Miami Herald column of May 20, 1990, when he reported that he possessed footage of the event. Barry wrote, [...] "Here at the [...] Institute <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> it often, especially at parties." [...] Some time later, the Oregon State Highway division started to receive calls from the media after a shortened version of the article was distributed on bulletin boards under the title [...] "The Far Side Comes to Life in Oregon". The unattributed copy of Barry's article did not explain that the event had happened approximately twenty-five years earlier. Barry later said that, on a fairly regular basis, someone would forward him the [...] "authorless" [...] column and suggest he write something about the described incident.|$|E
2500|$|Critic Roger Ebert lauded {{the film}} in his film review, writing, [...] "The Official Story is part polemic, part thriller, part tragedy. It belongs on the list with films like Z, Missing and El Norte, which examine the human aspects of {{political}} unrest. It is a movie that asks some very hard questions ... Alicia is played in the movie by Norma Aleandro, whose performance won the best actress award at this year's Cannes Film Festival. It is a performance that {{will be hard to}} forget, particularly since so much of it is internal. Some of the key moments in the film come as <b>we</b> <b>watch</b> Aleandro and realize what must be taking place inside her mind, and inside her conscience. Most political films play outside the countries that they are about; [...] "The Official Story" [...] is now actually playing in Argentina, where it must be almost unbearably painful for some of the members of its audiences. It was almost as painful for me." ...|$|E
