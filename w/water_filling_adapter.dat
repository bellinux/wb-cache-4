MIMO is a promising high data rate interface technology. It is well known the capacity of MIMO can be significantly enhanced by employing a proper power budget allocation in wireless cellular network.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} properties of simultaneous <b>water</b> <b>filling</b> for a wireless system with two mutually interfering transmitters and receivers with non-cooperative coding strategies. This is slightly {{different from the}} traditional interference channel problem which assumes that transmitters cooperate in their respective coding strategies, and that interference cancellation can be performed at the receivers. In this non-cooperative setup, greedy capacity optimization by individual transmitters through various algorithms leads to simultaneous <b>water</b> <b>filling</b> fixed points where the spectrum of the transmit covariance matrix of one user <b>water</b> <b>fills</b> over the spectrum of its corresponding interference-plus-noise covariance matrix, and in our paper we study the properties of these fixed points. We show that at a simultaneous <b>water</b> <b>filling</b> point the eigenvectors of transmit covariance matrices at each receiver are aligned, and identify three regimes which correspond to simultaneous <b>water</b> <b>filling</b> that depend on the interference gains: a) complete spectral overlap, b) partial spectral overlap, and c) spectral segregation. These imply that the transmit covariance matrices will be white in regions of both overlap and segregation, but not necessarily white overall. We also consider performance {{as a function of}} interference gain and show that complete spectral overlap is a strongly suboptimal solution over a wide range of gains. Overall...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Multi-carrier CDMA {{technology}} is a very attractive multiple access technique for next generation wireless communication systems. It combines the advantages of both Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) for high data rate transmission. However, interference noise is considered as a major challenge for MC-CDMA systems and significantly affects its performance. The transmission strategy to avoid the interference noise is by its power allocation to each user. The Game theory is an efficient way for examining power control problem in the MC-CDMA technology. The <b>water</b> <b>filling</b> algorithm in game theory perspective is used to allocate proper power for every sub-channel based on channel state information(CSI) with global power constraint {{in order to improve}} the capacity of the MC-CDMA system. The <b>water</b> <b>filling</b> provides optimal solution if the channel state information is perfect. In realistic high mobility environment, where the Doppler frequency is high, channel state information received at the transmitter is outdated due to CSI feedback delay which results in imperfectness in the channel state information. The capacity achieved using <b>water</b> <b>filling</b> game theory is analysed with Perfect CSI, Imperfect CSI and Predicted CSI. The <b>water</b> <b>filling</b> game theory with Predicted CSI shows improvement in the capacity compared to <b>water</b> <b>filling</b> game theory with Imperfect CSI.

In this paper we focus on systems with strong interference for which the simultaneous <b>water</b> <b>filling</b> solution implies not an unique fixed point but a set of fixed points, among which the information theoretic capacities of users vary widely.
