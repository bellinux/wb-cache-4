Harrison for Julian Street Jr. and his wife, Narcissa, in 1938. Harrison, primarily known as a monuments architect through his works in New York City like Rockefeller Center and the United Nations complex, also designed a few private residences. Harrison designed and built the residence at 710 Long Hill Road West as an unconventional experiment in the early Modernist architecture that <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>being</b> introduced in America during the late 1930s.|$|E

25|$|The {{artists of}} Paris {{were in a}} {{difficult}} situation during the Directory; their most important patrons, the aristocracy, had been executed or sent into exile, and a new wealthy class <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>being</b> formed. Before the Revolution a half-figure portrait could be commissioned from a less-known artist for three hundred livres. During the Directory the price fell to forty-eight livres. Nonetheless, the Salon {{took place in the}} Louvre in 1795 as it had in the years before the Revolution, and each year thereafter. The most prominent artist of the revolutionary period, David, closely connected with the Jacobins, was in seclusion in his studio inside the Louvre, but a new generation of artists showed their works; François Gérard; Anne-Louis Girodet, a pupil of David, famous for his romantic paintings, particularly a 1797 painting of the prominent actress and courtesan Mademoiselle Lange as Venus; Carle Vernet, the son and father of famous painters; The portrait painter Jean-Baptiste Isabey, who painted all the rulers of France from Marie-Antoinette through Napoleon III; the genre painter Louis-Léopold Boilly; Antoine-Jean Gros, a young history and landscape painter, who soon achieved fame and a government position in 1796 with a heroic portrait of Napoleon at the battle of Arcole; the romantic landscapes of Hubert Robert; Pierre-Paul Prud'hon, whose work combined classicism and romanticism; and a major neoclassical sculptor from the earlier generation, the sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon, famous for his busts of George Washington and Voltaire.|$|E

It was also alleged that when compared to Fitzgeralds previous captain, McSorley did {{not keep up with}} routine maintenance and did not confront the mates about getting the requisite work done. After August B. Herbel, Jr., president of the American Society for Testing and Materials, examined photographs of the welds on Fitzgerald, he stated, [...] "the hull <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>being</b> held together with patching plates." [...] Other questions were raised as to why the USCG did not discover and take corrective action in its pre-November 1975 inspection of Fitzgerald given that her hatch coamings, gaskets, and clamps were poorly maintained.|$|E

500|$|The painter Piero della Francesca (c.1415–1492) {{exemplified}} {{this new}} shift in Italian Renaissance thinking. He {{was an expert}} mathematician and geometer, writing books on solid geometry and [...] perspective, including De Prospectiva Pingendi (On Perspective for Painting), Trattato d'Abaco (Abacus Treatise), and De corporibus regularibus (On Regular Solids). The historian Vasari in his Lives of the Painters calls Piero the [...] "greatest geometer of his time, or perhaps of any time." [...] Piero's interest in perspective {{can be seen in}} his paintings including the Polyptych of Perugia, the San Agostino altarpiece and The Flagellation of Christ. His work on geometry influenced later mathematicians and artists including Luca Pacioli in his De Divina Proportione and Leonardo da Vinci. Piero studied classical mathematics and the works of Archimedes. He was taught commercial arithmetic in [...] "abacus schools"; his writings are formatted like abacus school textbooks, perhaps including Leonardo Pisano (Fibonacci)'s 1202 Liber Abaci. Linear perspective <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>being</b> introduced into the artistic world. Alberti explained in his 1435 De pictura: [...] "light rays travel in straight lines from points in the observed scene to the eye, forming a kind of pyramid with the eye as vertex." [...] A painting constructed with linear perspective is a cross-section of that pyramid.|$|E
500|$|The Enterprise is soon {{met by a}} Klingon battlecruiser, captained by Commander K'Nera (David Froman), who {{demands the}} return of the {{fugitive}} Klingons. Knowing that Korris and Konmel will be tried and executed if they are returned, Worf argues instead for their exile to a hostile planet, but K'Nera refuses. Korris and Konmel use parts secreted on their uniforms to assemble a disruptor pistol and escape from the brig; Konmel is killed as Korris takes over the Engineering deck. Picard and Worf race to Engineering, and Worf tries to reason with Korris who is threatening to destroy the warp core and take the Enterprise with him. Korris attempts to persuade Worf to come with him and conquer the galaxy as a true Klingon and then accuses Worf of being weak when he refuses. Worf fires on Korris, killing him. K'Nera is told of the deaths of the fugitives, and Worf declares that they [...] "died well" [...] when asked of their manner of death. Worf agrees to consider an offer to serve aboard the Klingon battlecruiser after his service aboard the Enterprise is complete, but when communications with K'Nera are broken off, assures the bridge crew he <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>being</b> polite.|$|E
500|$|To placate anxious fans, Broussard {{decided to}} create another trailer for E3 2001—it was the first public look at the game in three years. The video showed {{a couple of minutes}} of in-game footage, which notably showed the player moving in what appears to be Las Vegas and a certain level of {{interactivity}} (the player buys a sandwich from a vending machine and pushes each individual button on a keypad with Duke's outstretched finger). The trailer was impressive, and Duke Nukem was the talk of the convention; IGN reported on the game's graphics, saying, [...] "Characters come to life with picturesque facial animations that are synced perfectly with speech, hair that swings as they bob their heads, eyes that follow gazes, and more. The particle effects system, meanwhile, boasts impressive explosion effects with shimmering fire, shattered glass, and blood spilt in every direction [...] Add in real-time lighting effects, interactive environments, and a variation in locales unequaled in any other first-person shooter and you begin to see and understand why Duke Nukem Forever {{has been one of the}} most hotly anticipated titles over the last couple of years." [...] Duke Nukem Forever looked as good or better than most games, and staff at 3D Realms recalled a sense of elation after the presentation; [...] "The video <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>being</b> eaten up by people," [...] one said. [...] "We were so far ahead of other people at the time." [...] While many of the staff expected Broussard to make a push for finishing the game, however, he still did not have a finished product in mind. Following the death of one of Gathering of Developers' co-founders and continuing financial problems, the publishers' Texas-based offices were shut down and absorbed into parent company Take-Two Interactive.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concept of}} the [...] "ace" [...] emerged in 1915 during World War I, {{at the same time}} as aerial dogfighting. It was a {{propaganda}} term intended to provided the home front with a cult of the hero in what was otherwise a war of attrition. The individual actions of aces were widely reported and the image was disseminated of the ace as a chivalrous knight reminiscent of a bygone era. For a brief early period when air-to-air combat <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>being</b> invented, the exceptionally skilled pilot could shape the battle in the skies. For most of the war, however, the image of the ace had little to do with the reality of air warfare, in which fighters fought in formation and air superiority depended heavily on the relative availability of resources.|$|E
2500|$|Twenty-eight former Spanish Air Force Hispano Aviación HA-1112s {{were used}} in the 1969 film Battle of Britain as [...] "stand-ins" [...] to depict Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters of the Luftwaffe, 27 single-seat M1Ls, and one two-seat M4L. Eighteen were flown, six could taxi, the rest used to dress sets. In the mid-1960s at the time {{aircraft}} began to be collected for the film to be made, the only genuine Bf 109s known to exist were unairworthy examples in museums such as the Imperial War Museum and the South African National Museum of Military History or in private hands; whereas the HA-1112 <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>being</b> retired from service with the Spanish Air Force and several airframes in flyable condition and some 50 dismantled Buchóns were up for disposal bid.

After The Commitments, a couple of us got representation in LA and it was mostly rubbish. They drive you around to meet about 30 different people, but I was never the Hollywood starlet those people wanted. The only time I ever fitted into anybody's blueprint was with Tarantino. He was the man. Bring on the freaks! Bring out the people, now deemed shells, whose career is over. But he is unique. He's such a wonderful director and such a nice bloke.

2500|$|In February 2011, Susan Hill {{from the}} Daily Star {{reported}} that Lynsey {{would become the}} next target of serial killer Silas Blissett. Hassan revealed that executive producer Paul Marquess brought her into his office {{to tell her that}} she would be involved in a [...] "really big storyline", which he outlined to her, leaving her really excited. The storyline began when Lynsey angered Silas, who then attacked her. Silas was scared off after Lynsey's screams alerted his grandson Riley Costello (Rob Norbury) to the situation. Hassan thought Lynsey's [...] "steeliness" [...] helped her break free from Silas. Lynsey realised Silas was the one who attacked her, after she heard his voice which [...] "triggers a flashback" [...] to the moment of the attack. Hassan added that when nobody believed Lynsey, it [...] "makes her want to bring Silas down even more. She's determined to find the evidence she needs to expose him for what he is". Waugh, who plays Lynsey's best friend Cheryl, explained that everyone believes that Lynsey is crazy and has made up the allegations. Lynsey then turns to Cheryl for help and although she hates seeing her best friend in such a state, Cheryl believed Lynsey <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>being</b> paranoid.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} film was released, Cleese and Palin engaged in debate on the BBC2 {{discussion}} programme Friday Night, Saturday Morning with Malcolm Muggeridge and Mervyn Stockwood, the Bishop of Southwark, who put forward arguments against the film. Muggeridge and the Bishop, it was later claimed, had arrived 15 minutes late to see a screening of the picture prior to the debate, missing the establishing scenes demonstrating that Brian and Jesus were two different characters, and hence contended {{that it was a}} send-up of Christ himself. Both Pythons later felt {{that there had been a}} strange role reversal in the manner of the debate, with two young upstart comedians attempting to make serious, well-researched points, while the Establishment figures engaged in cheap jibes and point scoring. They also expressed disappointment in Muggeridge, whom all in Python had previously respected as a satirist (he had recently converted to Christianity after meeting Mother Teresa and experiencing what he described as a miracle). Cleese expressed that his reputation had [...] "plummeted" [...] in his eyes, while Palin commented that, [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>being</b> Muggeridge, preferring to have a very strong contrary opinion as opposed to none at all." [...] Muggeridge's verdict on {{the film was}} that it was [...] "Such a tenth-rate film that it couldn't possibly destroy anyone's genuine faith." ...|$|E
