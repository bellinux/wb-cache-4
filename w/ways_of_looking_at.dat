25|$|For the Abhidharmikas, {{truth was}} twofold {{and there are}} two <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> reality. One way is the way of {{everyday}} experience and of normal worldly persons. This is the category of the nominal and the conceptual (paññatti), and is termed the conventional truth (saṃvṛti-satya). However, the way of the Abhidharma, and hence the way of enlightened persons like the Buddha, who have developed the true insight (vipassana), sees reality as the constant stream of collections of dharmas, and this way of seeing the world is ultimate truth (paramārtha-satya).|$|E
25|$|About {{halfway through}} the book, Cochran and Harpending pause to {{consider}} two different <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the information found in gene variants. Researchers commonly see them merely as markers of human migration, ignoring their functions. The authors support such research, but argue for a more complete understanding of the geographic distributions of genes. Where the usual geographical analysis treats the distribution of genes as an effect of history, in the authors' view, the genes themselves are a major cause: Two variants in the same gene do not necessarily have the same effect, and their relative, selective benefits will control the spread of genes through populations in both space and time.|$|E
25|$|According to {{historian}} Stephen Barnes, {{there exist}} four major <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> {{the origins and}} functions of the Gulag. The first approach was championed by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, and is what Barnes terms the 'moral explanation'. According to this view, Soviet ideology eliminated the moral checks on {{the darker side of}} human nature - providing convenient justifications for violence and evil-doing on all levels: from political decision-making to personal relations. Another approach is the 'political explanation', according to which the Gulag (along with executions) was primarily a means for eliminating the regime's perceived political enemies (this understanding is favored, among others, by historian Robert Conquest). The 'economic explanation', in turn as set out by historian Anne Applebaum, argues that the Soviet regime instrumentalized the Gulag for its economic development projects. Although never economically profitable, it was perceived as such right up to Stalin's death in 1953. Finally, Barnes advances his own, fourth explanation, which situates the Gulag in the context of modern projects of 'cleansing' the social body of hostile elements, through spatial isolation and physical elimination of individuals defined as harmful.|$|E

Dean did not mind when his melodies were not accepted by Weiland. [...] "hen I write a song, I know what I {{want it to be}} melodically. But Scott always... knocks my melodies out of the water." [...] Weiland worked on the lyrics using these demo arrangements, often making suggestions for musical phrases to be doubled or moved.

[...] However, both Dean and Robert would be surprised at the direction Weiland would take the songs, which could have been composed with an entirely different vision.

500|$|Escher's work is inescapably mathematical. This {{has caused}} a {{disconnect}} between his full-on popular fame {{and the lack of}} esteem with which he has been viewed in the art world. His originality and mastery of graphic techniques is respected, but his works have been thought too intellectual and insufficiently lyrical. Movements such as conceptual art have to a degree reversed the art world's attitude to intellectuality and lyricism, but this did not rehabilitate Escher because traditional critics still disliked his narrative themes and his use of perspective. However, these same qualities made his work highly attractive to the public. Escher is not the first artist to explore mathematical themes: Parmigianino (1503–1540) had explored spherical geometry and reflection in his 1524 Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror, depicting his own image in a curved mirror, while William Hogarth's 1754 Satire on False Perspective, foreshadows Escher's playful exploration of errors in perspective. Another early artistic forerunner is Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720–1778), whose dark [...] "fantastical" [...] prints such as The Drawbridge in his Carceri ("Prisons") sequence depict perspectives into complex architecture with many stairs and ramps, peopled by walking figures. Only with 20th century movements such as Cubism, De Stijl, Dadaism and Surrealism did mainstream art start to explore Escher-like <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the world with multiple simultaneous viewpoints. However, while Escher had much in common with, for example, Magritte's surrealism, he did not make contact with any of these movements.|$|E
