500|$|After a year, {{the coach}} was so {{impressed}} with Nowitzki's progress that he advised him: [...] "You must now decide <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> play against {{the best in the world}} or just stay a local hero in Germany. If you choose the latter, we will stop training immediately, because nobody can prevent that anymore. But if you want to play against the best, we have to train on a daily basis." [...] After pondering this lifetime decision for two days, Nowitzki agreed to enter the full-time training schedule, choosing the path to his eventual international career. Geschwindner let him train seven days a week with DJK Würzburg players and future German internationals Robert Garrett, Marvin Willoughby, and Demond Greene, and in the summer of 1994, then 16-year-old Nowitzki made the DJK squad.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} spent $4 {{million to}} restore Dealey Plaza to 1963 conditions. Stone utilized {{a variety of}} film stocks. Richardson said, [...] "It depends <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> shoot in 35 or 16 or Super 8. In many cases the lighting has to be different." [...] For certain shots in the film, Stone employed multiple camera crews shooting at once, using five cameras {{at the same time}} in different formats. Richardson said of Stone's style of direction, [...] "Oliver disdains convention, he tries to force you into things that are not classic. There's this constant need to stretch." [...] This forced the cinematographer to use lighting in diverse positions and rely very little on classic lighting modes. The shoot lasted 79 days with filming finished five months before the release date.|$|E

500|$|The {{soundtrack of}} VVVVVV was {{composed}} by chiptune musician Magnus Pålsson (also known as SoulEye). Cavanagh approached Pålsson to compose VVVVVV after playing Space Phallus, an indie game by Charlie's Games, which featured a song by him. [...] Pålsson {{wrote on the}} Distractionware blog that, upon playing Cavanagh's previous games, he was [...] "amazed at the depth {{that came with the}} games, even though they were small and short." [...] In writing the music for VVVVVV, Pålsson aimed to make [...] "uptempo happy songs that would ingrain themselves into your minds <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> or not, hopefully so much so that you’d go humming on them when not playing, and making you {{want to come back to}} the game even more." [...] The complete soundtrack, titled PPPPPP, was released alongside VVVVVV and is sold as a music download or CD on Pålsson's personal website. On June 12, 2014 Pålsson released a power metal version of the soundtrack titled MMMMMM which was arranged and performed by guitarist Jules Conroy. [...] The album contains a mod file to replace the in-game music with the metal tracks.|$|E
500|$|URBs Dan Vidal {{called the}} album [...] "a {{spectrum}} of sound — packed and arranged perfectly into a masterfully composed (debut) full-length body of work... genre-defying masterpiece". Comparing it to singer Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 (1989), Brentin Mock of The Atlantic called The ArchAndroid [...] "a smothered funk, though perhaps at times too thick, too inaccessible, {{but not so}} much I didn't want to shake my ass" [...] and viewed it as musically progressive, stating [...] "Monáe has given pop music its first Toni Morrison moment, where fantasy, funk, and the ancestors come together for an experience that evolves one's soul... You really don't know <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> diagram it, dance to it, or just be dumbstruck. It owes as much to Parliament-Funkadelic as it does to Samuel R. Delany and Octavia E. Butler. She is finally doing what a number of artists—particularly black artists—have not been able to do in years, and that's move pop music forward". Robert Christgau was less impressed in The Barnes & Noble Review, deeming it [...] "the most overrated album of the year" [...] while writing that Monáe's [...] "songwriting is 60th percentile, her singing technical, her sci-fi plot the usual rot".|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} month, Beiderbecke {{enrolled at}} the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa. His stint in academia was even briefer than his time in Detroit, however. When he attempted to pack his course schedule with music, his guidance counselor forced him instead to take religion, ethics, physical education, and military training. It was an institutional blunder that Benny Green described as being, in retrospect, [...] "comical," [...] "fatuous," [...] and [...] "a parody." [...] Beiderbecke promptly began to skip classes, and after he participated in a drunken bar fight, he was expelled. That summer he played with his friends Don Murray and Howdy Quicksell at a lake resort in Michigan. The band was run by Goldkette, and it put Beiderbecke in touch with another musician he had met before: the C-melody saxophone player Frankie Trumbauer. The two hit it off, both personally and musically, despite Trumbauer having been warned by other musicians: [...] "Look out, he's trouble. He drinks and you'll {{have a hard time}} handling him." [...] They were inseparable for {{much of the rest of}} Beiderbecke's career, with Trumbauer acting as a father figure to Beiderbecke. When Trumbauer organized a band for an extended run at the Arcadia Ballroom in St. Louis, Beiderbecke joined him. There he also played alongside the clarinetist Pee Wee Russell, who praised Beiderbecke's ability to drive the band. [...] "He more or less made <b>you</b> play <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> or not," [...] Russell said. [...] "If you had any talent at all he made you play better." ...|$|R
