5000|$|DataLounge was {{launched}} by Mediapolis, Inc. in May, 1995. During the site's early years, content included gay-oriented news, gossip, {{links to other}} sites/services, and editorial content that made it a gay <b>Web</b> <b>portal.</b> <b>Content</b> contributors included New York drag queen Trudy and journalist Chris Barillas. DataLounge affiliated itself via the DataLounge Network with other web sites such as the gay dating site Edwina.com, gay Web guide Homorama, and gay health information site Gay Health, offering information and services to gays and lesbians. A weekly e-mail was also offered to users. The site evolved to have several discussion forums covering topics such as lesbian, religious and sexual issues, and also created a [...] "Flames and Freaks" [...] forum to house threads that site administrators determined to be disruptive to general forum discussion. Forums created for subpopulations such as The Lord of the Rings fans and U.S. daytime drama aficionados were subsequently closed. The most popular forum was the Gossip Forum, which dwarfed all others in both traffic and number of discussion threads created. A portion of DataLounge and the DataLounge Network's content came {{as a result of}} the integration of some of the 1995-97 content of Out.com from Out Magazine, which announced in March 1997 that it was closing its Web site to focus on print content. Out.com users were redirected to DataLounge, and DataLounge administrators adopted Out.com's discussion forums, dating service, and weekly survey. In 2003, DataLounge instituted a subscription service which blocked all web banner and pop-up advertising for a $12 annual fee (this fee was subsequently raised to $15, then to the present price of $18). In 2005, DataLounge was given a major redesign. All forum topics were collapsed into one general discussion forum called [...] "The DataLounge Forum," [...] and all news content, most references to the other sites in the DataLounge Network, and other features were discontinued. Editorial commentary discussing events continues to appear on the site. Users were also given the option to control aspects of the site's layout, including filtration of political, gossip, and/or [...] "Flames and Freaks" [...] threads. With this redesign came a policy change that limited access to the DataLounge Forum during high-traffic [...] "primetime" [...] periods to fee-paying subscribers. This move was met with controversy amongst DataLounge users, as non-subscribers were blocked from the DataLounge Forum during these periods. Though Mediapolis has received complaints about the policy, specifically that [...] "primetime" [...] periods are irregular and can often occur at times when site traffic should be at its slowest (e.g., North American overnight hours), DataLounge administrators assert that the [...] "primetime" [...] is necessary to prevent slowdowns of the other sites which Mediapolis hosts on the same servers, and preserves the existence of the DataLounge forum by generating revenue to cover DataLounge's hosting, bandwidth and maintenance expenses. In the summer of 2007 DataLounge instituted a policy that only paying members may start new threads, but in May 2009 DataLounge launched another comprehensive redesign of the site, dubbed [...] "V6," [...] one that allows users to embed photos and YouTube videos, as well as mark specific threads to watch. The new site is auto-refreshed in real-time as new posts are written, and nonpaying members were at first permitted to start threads, but that quickly changed. The DataLounge Webmaster explained in introducing the redesigned site that the transition was largely dictated by the effect of tabbed Web browsing, which resulted in users constantly using their browsers' refresh function and overloading the servers, sending the site into constant primetime mode. However, shortly after launching V6, the Webmaster reinstituted primetime, in part due to the quick proliferation of racist troll posts.|$|E

40|$|Web portal {{services}} {{have become an}} important medium to deliver digital content (e. g. news, advertisements, etc.) to Web users in a timely fashion. To attract more users to various content modules on the Web portal, {{it is necessary to}} design a recommender system that can effectively achieve <b>Web</b> <b>portal</b> <b>content</b> optimization by automatically estimating content item attractiveness and relevance to user interests. The state-of-the-art online learning methodology adapts dedicated pointwise models to independently estimate the attractiveness score for each candidate content item. Although such pointwise models can be easily adapted for online recommendation, there still remain a few critical problems. First, this pointwise methodology fails to use invaluable user preferences between content items. Moreover, the performance of pointwise models decreases drastically when facing the problem of sparse learning samples. To address these problems, we propose exploring a new dynamic pairwise learning methodology for <b>Web</b> <b>portal</b> <b>content</b> optimization in which we exploit dynamic user preferences extracted based on users ’ actions on portal services to compute the attractiveness scores of content items. In this article, we introduce two specific pairwise learning algorithms, a straightforward graph-based algorithm and a formalized Bayesian modeling one. Experiments on large-scale data from a commercial Web portal demonstrate the significant improvement of pairwise methodologies over the baseline pointwise models. Further analysis illustrates that our new pairwise learning approache...|$|E

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study explored Facebook as a communication tool for student affairs and compared it {{as a source}} with other communication modalities to describe the 18 - 24 year old student preference on receiving information about student affairs departments and activities. The research questions were designed to provide feedback on the current purpose[s] of student use of Facebook for student affairs services as well as reporting additional services and activities that would be considered {{through the use of}} Facebook. Differences in use among institutional types were also explored. The results of 395 online survey responses were compared to focus groups consisting of student ambassadors at a two-year public, four-year private, and four-year public institution. The online survey participants {{were asked to respond to}} specific modes of communication based upon each service or activity. The focus groups were asked the same questions in an open-ended format and the results were compared to the online results. The results indicate that depending on the event or activity, the students preferred a different method of communication, not necessarily Facebook for information on student affairs programming. These results also differed among institutional types. Two-year institutions have the greatest potential to increase their presence on Facebook. One theme that emerged from the open-ended response question in the online survey was that institutions participating on Facebook should limit content so that it is more social in nature and leave academically related issues to institutionally driven communication modalities. There are numerous options to communicate information to students and finding the best one may be more challenging than actually disseminating the information. With the administrative challenges and lack of student responses encouraging Facebook usage, institutions of higher education are not encouraged to spend enormous resources in this one particular communication modality. Given the high number of responses from the online survey combined with feedback from the focus groups, enhanced email options or <b>web</b> <b>portal</b> <b>content</b> might serve the current needs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Customizability is {{generally}} considered a desirable feature of <b>web</b> <b>portals.</b> However, if left uncontrolled, customizability may come {{at the price of}} lack of uniformity or lack of maintainability. Indeed, as the <b>portal</b> <b>content</b> and services evolve, they can break assumptions made in the definition of customized views. Also, uncontrolled customization may lead to certain content considered important by the <b>web</b> <b>portal</b> owners (e. g. advertisements), to not be displayed to end users. Thus, <b>web</b> <b>portal</b> customization is hindered by the need to enforce customization policies and guidelines with minimal overhead. This paper presents a case study where a combination of techniques was employed to semi-automatically enforce policies and guidelines on community-built presentation components in a <b>web</b> <b>portal.</b> The study shows that a combination of automated verification and semantics extraction techniques can reduce the amount of manual checks required to enforce these policies and guidelines...|$|R

This work aims to provide more efficient DL reasoning techniques for frequently changing instance bases (ABoxes). More specifically, we investigate the process of incrementally updating the tableau completion graphs used for reasoning in the expressive DLs SHOQ and SHIQ, which correspond to a large subset of the W 3 C standard Web Ontology Language, OWL-DL. We present an algorithm for updating completion graphs under the syntactic addition and removal of ABox assertions. We also provide an empirical analysis of the approach through an implementation in the Pellet OWL-DL reasoner. ...|$|R
