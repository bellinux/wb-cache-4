[...] After losing his eyesight, now somewhat restored, he listened to CB radio and call-in talk shows and found inspiration for the album. [...] In a 2013 interview, McAloon stated:That record I Trawl The Megahertz {{was so important to}} me. I was disappointed—extremely—that the Guardian never even reviewed it. That stayed with me. I kept <b>waiting</b> <b>week</b> after week: [...] "Come on, if you're thinking they don't make records like they used to, if you're looking for personal vision, something unusual—I'm your guy!" [...] But it never came.|$|E

50|$|Paid {{inclusion}} is {{a search}} engine marketing method in itself, but also a tool of search engine optimization, since experts and firms can test out different approaches to improving ranking and see the results often {{within a couple of}} days, instead of <b>waiting</b> <b>weeks</b> or months. Knowledge gained this way can be used to optimize other web pages, without paying the search engine company.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to being the, [...] "point man on long-overdue reforms to the state’s unemployment insurance system" [...] Fowell oversaw a number of reforms that increased efficiency in the Department of Employment Security. Reform efforts resulted in significantly decreased wait times at the DES call center, faster disposition of cases and more effective procedures for identifying fraudulent claims. These procedures included implementation of an administrative <b>wait</b> <b>week,</b> as well as photo ID requirements.|$|R

60|$|The Duke of Burgundy listened--but waited. He {{could not}} {{doubt that the}} French King or the French people would come forward {{presently}} and pay a higher price than the English.

50|$|Both Social Health Insurance (SHI) {{and privately}} insured patient {{experienced}} low waits, but privately insured patients' waits were even lower. According to the Kassenärztliche Bundesvereinigung (KBV), the body representing contract physicians and contract psychotherapists at federal level, 56% of Social Health Insurance patients <b>waited</b> 1 <b>week</b> or less, while only 13% waited longer than 3 weeks for a doctor's appointment. 67% of privately insured patients <b>waited</b> 1 <b>week</b> or less, while 7% waited longer than 3 weeks (Kassenärztliche Bundesvereinigung, 2016).|$|R

50|$|Forecasters in {{the late}} 1960s underestimated demand, {{resulting}} in a shortage of capacity in Manhattan, NYTel's principal profit area. Customers had to <b>wait</b> <b>weeks</b> for a new line or a repair, and sometimes minutes for dial tone on an existing line. The new 1ESS Stored Program Control exchanges had software bugs that kept them from carrying full load. Deferred maintenance choked main distribution frames (MDFs) with dead jumpers. There were not enough cables to office buildings, nor enough underground conduits to install them. Morale was poor in all levels and departments; strikes were frequent.|$|R
40|$|Technology is {{enabling}} {{organizations to}} more efficiently collect and report data {{to meet new}} and evolving standards and expectations. Using the intranet is allowing management to get critical reports on their screens {{in a matter of}} seconds rather than having to <b>wait</b> <b>weeks.</b> These information networks are sometimes referred to as "extranets. " Unlike many other technologies that require new investments in systems and technologies, intranets capitalize on existing hardware and software investments. Extranets can be a powerful real-time feedback tool but it all depends on having an effective measurement process in place...|$|R
50|$|Service interruptions were common. When a {{volunteer}} {{was unable to}} make a shift assignment, the station went off the air. During ice storms, common in that area, ice accumulation on the broadcast antenna would force the station to shut down to protect its transmitter. (KWPB staff learned this lesson the hard way, after internal transmitter components were destroyed during ice events and the station was forced to <b>wait</b> <b>weeks</b> for replacement parts to be shipped in.) The station was also silent during school holidays, including the entire summer.|$|R
5000|$|Unitaid is {{investing}} {{heavily in}} [...] "test-and-treat" [...] technologies that allow patients {{to be diagnosed}} and treated on the spot in rural clinics {{instead of having to}} <b>wait</b> <b>weeks</b> for results to come back from central laboratories. Delays in diagnosis cause delays in treatment, giving illnesses time to become severe or fatal, and helping epidemics to spread. The test-and-treat approach, championed by global health organizations, is seen as one of the major new weapons in the post-2015 phase of the fight against the HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria epidemics.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{association}} between waiting times for different health care services and the duration of sick leave, using a Swedish register database supplemented with information from questionnaires for 3, 653 employees. The duration of sick leave is positively associated with <b>waiting</b> two <b>weeks</b> or more for primary care, technical investigations and specialists, compared to <b>waiting</b> one <b>week</b> or less. Except for waiting for a specialist, {{there is no indication}} that <b>waiting</b> four <b>weeks</b> or more is associated with longer durations of sick leave than waiting two to three <b>weeks.</b> Long <b>waiting</b> times for surgery is negatively associated with the duration of sick leave, which might be explained by prioritizing where patients with longer waiting times are those with less severe conditions. Including these waiting time variables did not induce substantial changes on the impact of traditional labor supply variables, which suggests that the parameter estimates of traditional variables are relatively robust. </p...|$|R

60|$|For {{the most}} part they came not back again; they <b>waited</b> <b>week</b> by week, month by month, year by year, till the moment was ripe, then gave the {{poisoned}} cup or drove home the dagger, and escaped or were slain. Death waited them abroad, and if they failed, death waited them at home. Their dreadful caliph was himself a sword of death. At his will they hurled themselves from towers or from precipices; to satisfy his policy they sacrificed their wives and children. And their reward--in life, the drugged cup and voluptuous dreams; after it, as they believed, a still more voluptuous paradise.|$|R

Mrs. Berkovich's violin was judged too valuable to be permitted to leave the country, so she {{gave it to her}} student Lena Ilyichova. Her son’s violin, however, was deemed cheap enough to go with him.
