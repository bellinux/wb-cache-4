5|$|Around 1749, Priestley became {{seriously ill}} and {{believed}} he <b>was</b> <b>dying.</b> Raised as a devout Calvinist, he believed a conversion experience {{was necessary for}} salvation, but doubted he had had one. This emotional distress eventually led him to question his theological upbringing, causing him to reject election and to accept universal salvation. As a result, the elders of his home church, the Independent Upper Chapel of Heckmondwike, refused him admission as a full member.|$|E
5|$|Babcock {{was married}} twice, first to Elsie, then to Dorothy, a woman nearly thirty {{years his junior}} whom he met when she {{was taking care of}} his first wife while she <b>was</b> <b>dying.</b> Babcock had one son (Jack Jr.) and one {{daughter}} (Sandra).

5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1949 Street & Smith, {{one of the largest}} pulp publishers, had shut down every one of their pulps. This format <b>was</b> <b>dying</b> out, though it took several more years before the pulps {{completely}} disappeared from the newsstands. Both Thrilling Wonder and Startling went quarterly in 1954, {{and at the end of}} that year Mines left. The magazines did not survive him for long; only two more issues of Thrilling Wonder appeared, both edited by Alexander Samalman. After the beginning of 1955, Thrilling Wonder was merged with Startling, which itself ceased publication at the end of 1955.|$|E
5|$|During the screening, {{the court}} heard that Muhammad had {{raised his hand}} to his {{forehead}} and moved his leg after the cameraman had said he was dead, {{and that there was no}} blood on his shirt. Enderlin argued that the cameraman had not said the boy was dead, but that he <b>was</b> <b>dying.</b> A report prepared for the court by Jean-Claude Schlinger, a ballistics expert commissioned by Karsenty, said that had the shots come from the Israeli position, Muhammad would have been hit in the lower limbs only.|$|E

5|$|Fifty-eight {{cardinals}} {{were present}} on 9 October when the conclave began. Since Charles II <b>was</b> <b>dying</b> at this time, Spain's cardinal electors were unsure {{of how they}} should vote, {{and they did not}} work closely with electors that were loyal to the Holy Roman Emperor. From the beginning, {{it was clear that the}} impending death of Charles II was likely to cause a lengthy conclave, because the next pope would be expected to respond to the anticipated political crisis in Spain following Charles' imminent death.|$|E
5|$|However, Brazil's {{champion}} {{in the fight for}} the abolition of slavery <b>was</b> <b>dying.</b> While in Europe, the first symptoms of mouth cancer appeared.

Until July 1880, he was still making appearances in Parliament to deliver speeches, but after that date he no longer attended. Rio Branco still kept a close watch on political developments, however, and continued to appear at meetings of the Council of State. He had already retired from teaching in 1877.|$|E

The diplomats were certain that {{the overwhelming majority of the}} English people backed Mary, but nevertheless believed that Queen Jane would be successfully established.|$|E

5|$|My Texas {{distributor}} {{arrived in}} the city where I was filming and asked me how it was going. I told him that I thought that it was good but that there was too much violence and passion, and he answered, “Roger, I’ve been in this business for forty years, and you’ve been in it for just two. Let me tell you that no one has ever made a film with too much passion and violence.” So I pressed on. Everyone <b>was</b> <b>dying.</b> At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E

5|$|Shiban was {{inspired}} to write the episode based on an incident that involved his wife's father potentially seeing other beings in a room when he <b>was</b> <b>dying.</b> Shiban was also inspired by the 1975 film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. The series sought out a bowling alley for the opening scenes, but many establishments in Vancouver, Canada were reluctant to yield over two-thirds of their space as well as close down for three days. Eventually, the Thunderbird Bowling Centre was chosen.|$|E
5|$|So I {{went out}} and saw the band – Billy, James, and D'arcy – playing at Avalon with a drum machine. Man, did they sound horrible! They were atrocious. But the thing I noticed was that {{not only were the}} song {{structures}} good, but Billy's voice had a lot of drive to it, like he <b>was</b> <b>dying</b> to succeed. So I ended up driving from work every Wednesday to rehearse with them.|$|E

When Stephen <b>was</b> <b>dying,</b> various boyars, who opposed Bogdan, rebelled, but they were suppressed. On his deathbed, he had urged Bogdan to continue to pay the tribute to the Sultan. He died on 2 July 1504 and was buried in the Monastery of Putna.|$|E
