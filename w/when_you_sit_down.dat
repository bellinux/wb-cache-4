[...] "The studio is just back from the holiday and is regrouping based on the news, and has no cohesive game plan at the moment," [...] said Kevin Misher, Universal's President of Production. Misher added that, [...] "It {{was one of those}} moments <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and think, 'Can Clarice be looked upon as James Bond for instance? A character who is replaceable?' Or was Jodie Foster Clarice Starling, and the audience will not accept anyone else?"

500|$|In [...] "How Orlo Got His Book", he {{described}} Orlo, a fictional, archetypal young {{child who was}} turned off of reading by the poor selection of simple reading material. To save Orlo the frustration, Geisel decided {{to write a book}} for children like Orlo but found the task [...] "not dissimilar to... being lost with a witch in a tunnel of love". He tried to write a story called [...] "The Queen Zebra" [...] but found that both words did not appear on the list. In fact, like Geisel wrote in [...] "My Hassle with the First Grade Language", the letters [...] "q" [...] and [...] "z" [...] did not appear on the list at all. He then tried to write a story about a bird, without using the word bird as it did not appear on the list. He decided to call it a [...] "wing thing" [...] instead but struggled as he discovered that it [...] "couldn't have legs or a beak or a tail. Neither a left foot or a right foot." [...] On his approach to writing The Cat in the Hat he wrote, [...] "The method I used is the same method you use <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> to make apple stroodle [...] without stroodles." ...|$|E

2500|$|Overall {{critical}} {{reception for}} Mega Man V has been average to positive. While {{many aspects of}} the game were commended, critics found very little change from previous installments in the series. VideoGames summarized, [...] "If you don't have a Mega Man game for your Game Boy, this one is a good as any. It's entertaining...it's Mega Man. If you're thinking 'rehash', you might be right and it's still a pretty fun game, though." [...] Nintendo Power was impressed by its gameplay and graphics, but felt that the game is too short, [...] "especially <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> with the Super Game Boy and cruise". GamePro was contrastingly unimpressed with the controls on the SNES, considering the use of Game Boy much simpler.|$|E

And on Sundays, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> put on a blue coat with brass buttons, you will think of nothing else to do but to go and lounge over the stone walls and rail fences, and stare at the corn growing. And you will look with a knowing eye at oxen, and will have a tendency to clamber over into pigsties, and feel of the hogs, and give a guess how much they will weigh after you shall have stuck and dressed them. Already I have noticed you begin to speak through your nose, and with a drawl. Pray, if you really did make any poetry to-day, let us hear it in that kind of utterance!" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{last day}} of May is come.

Yesterday there were three pints of bread-crumbs; this morning the little bag is found open and some of the crumbs are missing. 'We dislike to suspect any one of such a rascally act, but {{there is no question that}} this grave crime has been committed. Two days will certainly finish the remaining morsels. God grant us strength to reach the American group!' The third mate told me in Honolulu that in these days the men remembered with bitterness that the 'Portyghee' had devoured twenty-two days' rations while he lay waiting to be transferred from the burning ship, and that now they cursed him and swore an oath that if it came to cannibalism he should be the first to suffer for the rest.|$|E
60|$|Whether {{the taste}} the good lady had of matrimony {{discouraged}} her or not, I cannot say; but though her merits and her riches have attracted many suitors, {{she has never}} been tempted to venture again into the happy state. This is singular, too, for she seems of a most soft and susceptible heart; is always talking of love and connubial felicity, and is a great stickler for old-fashioned gallantry, devoted attentions, and eternal constancy, {{on the part of the}} gentlemen. She lives, however, after her own taste. Her house, I am told, must have been built and furnished about the time of Sir Charles Grandison: every thing about it is somewhat formal and stately; but has been softened down into a degree of voluptuousness, characteristic of an old lady, very tender-hearted and romantic, and that loves her ease. The cushions of the great arm-chairs, and wide sofas, almost bury you <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> on them. Flowers of the most rare and delicate kind are placed about the rooms, and on little japanned stands; and sweet bags lie about the tables and mantel-pieces. The house is full of pet dogs, Angora cats, and singing birds, who are as carefully waited upon as she is herself.|$|E
6000|$|... "The trouble {{this time}} is you," [...] said I, [...] "and your awful meekness. I never did see anybody {{anywhere}} as meek as you are in that dining-room. A half-drowned fly put into the sun to dry would be overbearing and supercilious compared to you. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> {{at one of those}} tables you look as if you was afraid of hurting the chair, and when the waiter gives you the bill of fare you ask him what the French words mean, and then he looks down on you as if he was a superior Jove contemplating a hop-toad, and he tells you that this one means beef and the other means potatoes, and brings you the things that are easiest to get. And you look as if you was thankful from the bottom of your heart that he is good enough to give you anything at all. All the airs I put on are no good while you are so extra humble. I tell him I don't want this French thing--when I don't know what it is--and he must bring me some of the other--which I never heard of--and when it comes I eat it, no matter what it turns out to be, and try to look as if I was used to it, but generally had it better cooked. But, as I said before, it is of no use--your humbleness is too much for me. In a few days they will be bringing us cold victuals, and recommending that we go outside somewhere and eat them, as all the seats in the dining-room are wanted for other people." ...|$|E
6000|$|The fact is, {{that among}} his hunters at least, the whale would by all hands be {{considered}} a noble dish, were there {{not so much of}} him; but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> come to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet long, it takes away your appetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men like Stubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are not so fastidious. We all know how they live upon whales, and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil. Zogranda, one of their most famous doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as being exceedingly juicy and nourishing. And this reminds me that certain Englishmen, who long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel-- that these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber. Among the Dutch whalemen these scraps are called [...] "fritters"; which, indeed, they greatly resemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling something like old Amsterdam housewives' dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh. They have such an eatable look that the most self-denying stranger can hardly keep his hands off.|$|R
5000|$|... 200 km/h in the Wrong Lane {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Entertainment.ie {{gave it a}} favorable review, awarding it three stars. They had said [...] "A teenage lesbian duo from Russia {{may sound like a}} marketing man's fantasy rather than a living, breathing pop band." [...] and finished saying [...] "Tatu's novelty value won't, of course, last forever. But for now, they're as entertaining as anyone in mainstream chart music." [...] James Martin from PopDirt was very positive by saying [...] "But all this cynicism seems irrelevant <b>when</b> <b>you</b> actually <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and listen to 200 km/H in the Wrong Lane." [...] He carried on saying [...] " [...] On the contrary 200 km/H In the Wrong Lane {{is one of the most}} innovative and unique pop records in very recent history." [...] Sputnikmusic was generally favorable. They stated [...] "I know, I know, I know. Tatu are a stupid manufactured Russian Euro pop band with their only bit of originality ... However I believe that this album could just be worth that second glance." [...] They later finished [...] "My verdict on this album is simply this: if you consider yourself open-minded in your music taste, check it out. You just might be surprised." [...] Michael Osborn from MusicOMH was positive, saying [...] "Short it may be, but TATU's initial English language offerings are fresh-sounding pop songs of such a high pedigree, that this is an album which will be played to death." [...] They later talked about the girls being on top headlines about the controversy and he stated [...] "Ignore all the headlines - this intriguing Russian act has the ability to hit all the right notes with their music alone, and have more than just one mammoth smash to offer." [...] David Merryweather from Drowned in Sound called the album [...] "the first pop masterpiece of the year" [...] and encouraged people [...] "Don’t pretend you don’t care." ...|$|R

60|$|Of course, I {{meant to}} imply by this that moving {{sometimes}} {{comes to an}} end, {{though it is not}} easy to believe so while moving. The time really arrives <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> in your new house, and amid whatever disorder take your first meal there. This meal is pretty sure to be that gloomy tea, that loathly repast of butter and toast, and some kind of cake, with which the soul of the early-dining American is daily cast down between the hours of six and seven in the evening; and instinctively you compare it with the last meal you took in your old house, seeking in vain to decide whether this is more dispiriting than that. At any rate that was not at all the meal which the last meal in any house which has been a home ought to be in fact, and is in books. It was hurriedly cooked; it was served upon fugitive and irregular crockery; and it was eaten in deplorable disorder, with the professional movers waiting for the table outside the dining- room. It ought to have been an act of serious devotion; it was nothing but an expiation. It should have been a solemn commemoration of all past dinners in the place, an invocation to their pleasant apparitions. But I, for my part, could not recall these at all, though now I think of them with the requisite pathos, and I know they were perfectly worthy of remembrance. I salute mournfully the companies that have sat down at dinner there, for they are sadly scattered now; some beyond seas, some beyond the narrow gulf, so impassably deeper to our longing and tenderness than the seas. But more sadly still I hail the host himself, and desire to know of him if literature was not somehow a gayer science in those days, and if his peculiar kind of drolling had not rather more heart in it then. In an odd, not quite expressible fashion, something of him seems dispersed abroad and perished in the guests he loved. I trust, of course, that all will be restored to him when he turns--as every man past thirty feels he may when he likes, and has the time--and resumes his youth. Or if this feeling is only a part of the great tacit promise of eternity, I am all the more certain of his getting back his losses.|$|E
