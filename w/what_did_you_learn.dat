This act provided for the support of at least one college in eat state where the leading object should be, “without excluding other scientific and classical studies, and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts”.

In this study I argue {{that an important}} narrative is all but missing from the discourses around school-community relationships; that is, children’s perspectives are rarely considered. This project—a grounded theory case study—seeks (at least in part) to fill this gap by exploring what can be learned as students assume the agency for teaching practitioners about their out-of-school learning experiences via a photovoice project, {{referred to in the}} study as the Community Exploration Project (CEP). I used theories of Culturally Relevant Pedagogy (Ladson-Billings, 1995) and Authentic Pedagogy (Newmann, Marks, & Gamoran, 1996) along with research on the Funds of Knowledge (Moll, Amanti, Neff, & Gonzalez, 1992), developmental assets (Scales, Benson, Leffert, & Blyth, 2000) and social capital (Coleman, 1988) as conceptual tools. In addition, I applied Weick’s (e. g., Weick & Sutcliffe, 2005) notion of sensemaking in analyzing how teachers and students interpreted new learning from the CEP. For the CEP fifth grade students collected photographs of their communities around a series of prompts (e. g., Where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>learn</b> in your community? <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>learn?).</b> They then had opportunities to share their work (to varying degrees) with their teachers and peers. Data collection primarily included student and teacher interviews before and after the CEP, classroom and school observations, and student photographs and captions. Data analysis led to an emerging theory of school-community relationships (as mediated by children). All participants to varying degrees valued the CEP experience; many described new learning from the project. What emerged, however, is that at least in this case new information was filtered through existing mental models, stereotypes, and personal experiences, which in some cases prompted additional reflection, but in others seemed to constrain the sensemaking process...|$|R

[...] was a {{standing}} question with uncle Pullet; whereupon Tom always looked sheepish, {{rubbed his hands}} across his face, and answered, [...] "I don't know." [...] It was altogether so embarrassing to be seated tête-à-tête with uncle Pullet, that Tom could not even look at the prints on the walls, or the flycages, or the wonderful flower-pots; he saw nothing but his uncle's gaiters. Not that Tom was in awe of his uncle's mental superiority; indeed, he had {{made up his mind}} that he didn't want to be a gentleman farmer, because he shouldn't like to be such a thin-legged, silly fellow as his uncle Pullet,--a molly-coddle, in fact. A boy's sheepishness {{is by no means a}} sign of overmastering reverence; and while you are making encouraging advances to him under the idea that he is overwhelmed by a sense of your age and wisdom, ten to one he is thinking you extremely queer. The only consolation I can suggest to you is, that the Greek boys probably thought the same of Aristotle. It is only when you have mastered a restive horse, or thrashed a drayman, or have got a gun in your hand, that these shy juniors feel you to be a truly admirable and enviable character. At least, I am quite sure of Tom Tulliver's sentiments on these points. In very tender years, when he still wore a lace border under his outdoor cap, he was often observed peeping through the bars of a gate and making minatory gestures with his small forefinger while he scolded the sheep with an inarticulate burr, intended to strike terror into their astonished minds; indicating thus early that desire for mastery over the inferior animals, wild and domestic, including cockchafers, neighbors' dogs, and small sisters, which in all ages has been an attribute of so much promise for the fortunes of our race. Now, Mr. Pullet never rode anything taller than a low pony, and was the least predatory of men, considering firearms dangerous, as apt to go off of themselves by nobody's particular desire. So that Tom was not without strong reasons when, in confidential talk with a chum, he had described uncle Pullet as a nincompoop, taking care at the same time to observe that he was a very [...] "rich fellow." ...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to find out elementary students knowledge about the environment, their attitudes towards helping the environment and what they actually have done to help the environment. Specifically, during the northern spring of 2002 all grade- 4 and grade- 5 students in one public elementary school in Miami-Dade County, Florida were administered the Children's Environmental Attitude and Knowledge Scale (CHEAKS) instrument. In 2002, some students in both grade levels interviewed each other in pairs to determine why they answered the way they did on the CHEAKS instrument. In the interviews, students discussed what they had been taught in school, compared to what they had learned outside of school that was related to the environment. The following year, during the northern spring of 2003, all grade- 4 and grade- 5 students in the same elementary school were given the CHEAKS instrument. Students at the elementary school were also asked questions which they answered in writing. These included: Which questions on the survey <b>did</b> <b>you</b> feel were difficult?; <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> remember <b>learning</b> about environmental education in school, at home or elsewhere? In addition, some gifted grade- 6 students, who attended the nearby middle school and other grade- 6 students who were in heterogeneous ability classes also responded to the CHEAKS instrument. Analysis of the data showed that grade- 4 students in this elementary school had a higher commitment to the environment than did grade- 5 students and gifted students had more knowledge than regular students. Only the gifted students in grade- 5 had a high commitment to the environment. Comparing independent t-test results in year 2002 between grade- 5 regular students (n= 105) and grade- 5 gifted students (n= 30), grade- 5 gifted students were statistically less committed to the environment in terms of scores on the Verbal Commitment. There was no difference in knowledge or commitment in grade- 6 students. Girls were more verbally committed to the environment than boys. Having knowledge about the environment did not necessarily mean students were committed to saving the environment or took action to solve environmental problems. The thesis concludes with explanations, discussions about the limitations of the study and suggestions for further research...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this report is to study the success of {{short-term}} intensive study programmes (ISPs) over the short-term perspective and highlight additional lessons for students which might be missed without the experience of working face-to-face on sophisticated tasks in multicultural teams. Approach/ Methodology – The evaluation of our ISPs was conducted using a quantitative methodology, via questionnaires given to students at the beginning, the middle {{and at the end}} of a course. The questionnaire development was based on the work of Prof. Dr. Scott Armstrong (Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania) for student self-assessment of their progress during participation in the MARCIEE project. Before, during and after the course, the participants filled out a questionnaire answering the following three questions: (1) <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> know? (2) <b>What</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> want to <b>learn?</b> (3) What have <b>you</b> <b>learned?</b> Using this procedure, the teachers of the ISPs got direct feedback about the knowledge base, the needs and the learning success for each individual topic. For international ISP evaluation, it was decided to assess the improvements related to (1) knowledge, (2) know-how and (3) soft skills. The questions related to knowledge were derived from the content of the program and the lectures during the program. Regarding the soft skills and knowledge assessment, we followed Beard, Schwieger and Surendran (2008), Betz and Hackett (1983) and Bandura (1977). The questionnaire was first pretested and improved based on the initial results. Findings – The reports provided an overview of the level of success in teaching intercultural programs in higher education, further development of our evaluation tools, and the contribution of IPSs in improving skills and cross-cultural competences. Originality/Value – There are a lack of tools measuring short term success of ISPs.
