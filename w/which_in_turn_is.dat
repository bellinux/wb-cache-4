5|$|Radon is a colorless and odorless gas {{generated}} by the breakdown of radioactive radium, <b>which</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> <b>is</b> the decay product of uranium, found in the Earth's crust.

Radon gas levels vary by locality and {{the composition of the}} underlying soil and rocks. About one in 15 homes in the US has radon levels above the recommended guideline of 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/l) (148 Bq/m³).|$|E

5|$|This result suffices to {{show that}} the number of steps in Euclid's {{algorithm}} can never be more than five times the number of its digits (base 10). For if the algorithm requires N steps, then b is {{greater than or equal to}} F'N+1 <b>which</b> <b>in</b> <b>turn</b> <b>is</b> greater than or equal to φ'N1, where φ is the golden ratio. Since b≥φ'N1, then N1≤logφ'b. Since log10φ>1/5, (N1)/5< log10φ logφ'b = log10b. Thus, N ≤ 5 log10b. Thus, the Euclidean algorithm always needs less than O(h) divisions, where h is the number of digits in the smaller number b.|$|E

Transcription of the rDNA occurs either in the FC or at the FC-DFC boundary, and, therefore, when rDNA transcription in the cell is increased, more FCs are detected. Most of the cleavage and modification of rRNAs occurs in the DFC, while the latter steps involving protein assembly onto the ribosomal subunits occur in the GC.|$|E
