5|$|Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins) arrives {{to report}} on the festival and is {{determined}} to find a negative story, although she does show excitement over Li'l Sebastian. She initially fails to find a scandal, but then overhears Leslie and Ben discussing the curse. It becomes the focus of her story, especially after Tom (Aziz Ansari) tells Leslie that Li'l Sebastian escaped his pen. Tom blames Jerry (Jim O'Heir), although it was entirely Tom's fault. The Pawnee media swarms the festival to cover the curse, endangering its opening the next day <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> press, with one reporter likening Ben's past as a failed teen mayor with the curse. Now believing himself to be the curse, Ben leaves the festival. As Leslie reassures the reporters there is no curse, the power generator blows out, leaving the festival dark and stranding most of the parks department on a Ferris wheel. Using the blackout as an excuse, Ann takes Donna's advice to make out with Kiley (Joey Russo), her dumb but attractive patient.|$|E

25|$|During the attack, an Iraqi {{doctor who}} was {{next door to}} the police station was alerted to the fact of the six RMPs being under siege and drove to the edge of town in an {{ambulance}} where a Major from 1 Para had established an Incident Control Point (ICP). He informed the Paratroopers of the RMPs plight at about midday local time and conveyed to the Paratroopers that the RMPs were being held hostage. At 12:30pm, Dr. Fasal returned to the ICP and informed Major Kemp that three of the British were dead. By now, with all 1 Para troops accounted for, the staff in the Ops Room were wondering who they could be and realized that they must be the six-man RMP section. By the time the doctor had returned to the police station, all of the RMPs were dead, and for a third time, he returned to the checkpoint <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> news. Later, Dr. Fasal brought all of the bodies out to the checkpoint and handed them over to the British.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, he {{won three}} of the first eight races of the season (Darlington, Texas, and Martinsville) and resumed the points lead (trading it with Jeff Gordon, with {{the two of them}} having the same point totals for a few {{different}} weeks) but won only one more time {{over the course of the}} year and faded back to fifth in the standings. This was a good and bad year for Jarrett; the good thing was that he won four races (New Hampshire was the fourth win in July) <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> part being the fact that he suffered a hard crash and a minor concussion at the new Kansas Speedway. In an interview, Jarrett said that he did remember not being in the Protection One 400 but only getting on the plane to go to the racetrack. After that season, Jarrett's long-time crew chief Todd Parrott departed and Jimmy Elledge took over the role as a replacement. After seven races of the 2002 season, Jarrett and Parrott reunited, and Jarrett went on to clinch two victories (Pocono and Michigan) and rebounded to ninth in the final standings after the poor start to the year.|$|E
25|$|In the Black Hawk War, Sac, Fox, and Kickapoo Native Americans, led by Chief Black Hawk, who {{had been}} {{relocated}} from Illinois to Iowa, attempted to resettle in their Illinois homeland on April 5, 1832. On May 10 Chief Black Hawk {{decided to go back}} to Iowa. On May 14, Black Hawk's forces met with a group of militia men led by Isaiah Stillman. All three members of Black Hawk's parley were shot and one was killed. The Battle of Stillman's Run ensued, leaving twelve militia men and three to five Sac and Fox warriors dead. Of the fifteen battles of the war, six took place in Wisconsin. The other nine as well as several smaller skirmishes took place in Illinois. The first confrontation to take place in Wisconsin was the first attack on Fort Blue Mounds on June 6, in which one member of the local militia was killed outside of fort. There was also the Spafford Farm Massacre on June 14, the Battle of Horseshoe Bend on June 16, which was a United States victory, the second attack on Fort Blue Mounds on June 20, and the Sinsinawa Mound raid on June 29. The Native Americans were defeated at the Battle of Wisconsin Heights on July 21, with forty to seventy killed and only one killed on the United States side. The Black Hawk War ended <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bad</b> Axe Massacre on August 1–2, with over 150 Native Americans dead and 75 captured and only five killed in the United States forces. Many of the Native American warchiefs were handed over to the United States on August 20, with the exception of Black Hawk and White Cloud, who surrendered on August 27, 1832. Black Hawk moved back to Iowa in 1833, after being held prisoner by the United States government.|$|E

500|$|... "Monster" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer Lady Gaga {{from her}} third {{extended}} play (EP), The Fame Monster (2009). Inspired by her [...] "Fear of Attachment Monster", the record was written by Gaga, RedOne and Space Cowboy, with RedOne producing the track. Gaga had explained that [...] "Monster" [...] describes her fear of sex and relationships, and described the lyrics as being in love <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> boy all the time, but instead of running away, one keeps {{going back to the}} same person. She added that the fear in [...] "Monster" [...] erupted from her need to have a stable relationship.

Andrew Coleman arranged, recorded, and edited the song with assistance from Todd Hurtt and Matthew Desrameaux; it was later mixed by Serban Ghenea. Nelly commented that the track blends elements of pop, hip hop, and country music, and elaborated that [...] "it's about having fun; kind of how a 4x4 truck symbolizes rebelliousness ... you know, mashing out, wanting to ride <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> boys." [...] He added that Cyrus [...] "does a little rapping and a little singing" [...] on the song, which he felt was {{a way in which}} she [...] "expresses herself".|$|E

She elaborated, [...] "It's the fear of attachment {{and the fear of}} loving something that's bad for you... If you listen to the lyrics, it's like being in love <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> boy all the time, and you keep going back for more." [...] Gaga added that the fear in [...] "Monster" [...] erupted from her need to have a stable relationship. [...] "I keep falling in love with the monster... But what I really need is the security and the safety and the womanhood, responsibility of my femininity. And so that's what that song is about.|$|E

500|$|After {{the loss}} of Cyprus to the Ottomans in the fourth Ottoman–Venetian War (1570–1573), the island of Crete (the [...] "Kingdom of Candia") was the last major {{overseas}} possession of Venice. Its important strategic position made it an obvious target for future Ottoman expansion, while its size and fertile ground, together <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> state of its fortresses, made it a more tempting prize than Malta. On the Venetian side, the Serenissima, with its weak military and great dependence on uninterrupted trade, was anxious not to provoke the Ottomans. Hence Venice scrupulously observed the terms of its treaty with the Ottomans, securing over sixty years of peaceful relations. By the early 17th century moreover, Venetian power had declined considerably. Its economy, which had once prospered because of its control over the Eastern spice trade, had suffered {{as a result of}} the opening of the new Atlantic trade routes, and from {{the loss of}} the important German market because of the Thirty Years' War. In addition, the Republic had become embroiled in a series of wars in northern Italy like the Mantuan War and was further weakened by an outbreak of the plague in 1629–1631.|$|E

500|$|After {{sitting out}} the 1949 season to allow {{time for his}} back to heal from the surgery, Fonville {{returned}} to competition in 1950. The 1950 U-M yearbook, Michiganensian, simultaneously lamented about and praised Fonville's comeback, noting his return to form with a [...] throw in the Michigan A.A.U. meet in January and describing how it would have earned {{second place in the}} 1948 Olympics. However, Fonville was not able to throw at the distances he reached in 1948. After a victory in a meet against Wisconsin, The Wisconsin State Journal said: [...] "Charlie Fonville, the former world recordholder in the shot put, heaved a creditable [...] to win the event. The Negro star, sidelined for 18months, returned to competition three weeks ago to heave more than 55feet." [...] He also won the Big Ten Conference indoor title for the third time. However, the AP noted that Fonville [...] "returned to competition this season after laying out last year and either has lost his terrific snap or is favoring the back." [...] Jim Fuchs of Yale broke Fonville's world record, and the AP reported: [...] "An injured back, perhaps, is all that stands in the way of boosting the world's record for the shot put to 60feet.

500|$|The episode {{received}} overwhelmingly positive {{reviews from}} critics.

Goldman described the episode as an [...] "especially strong installment, which delivered {{on a lot of}} fronts." [...] Goldman praised the scene depicting Sarah and Mauser's confrontation, writing, [...] "The entire ambience of the scene was terrific – a rainy night at a Christmas tree lot, with Chuck secretly watching as Sarah shot the unarmed, surrendering Mauser in cold blood - to the tune of 'Silent Night', no less. Of course she did this because she loves Chuck and wants to protect him, but all Chuck knows is that he just saw Sarah in a very scary light, and it's a great new dynamic to their relationship." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall wrote, [...] "Chuck vs. Santa Claus" [...] was moving along amusingly enough when it still seemed like Ned Rhyerson was just a hapless criminal <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> luck to crash into a store built above a top-secret government intelligence facility, but the surprising left turn it took when Chuck flashed on Lt. Mauser took things to another level." [...] Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, writing [...] "Santa Claus certainly delivered (character) goodies to everyone tonight. Morgan gets to be a hero, even if no one notices, taking down Ned with a fake snow machine. Jeff calls his mother–in prison–then finds the time to break up a mistletoe makeout session. Lester sneaks a smooch from Anna, and isn't even remotely fazed when it causes her to run for the hills. And Big Mike's embrace of cousin Big Al is a keeper." ...|$|E
