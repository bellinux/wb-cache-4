30|$|According to the {{structure}} analysis of <b>the</b> XHGS-n, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> increase of <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> temperature, <b>the</b> sp 3 -bonded carbon recovers to sp 2 -bonded carbon {{which leads to the}} increase of the electrical conductivity, so that the specific capacity values increase <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> temperature. Follow to this law, the specific capacity values of XHGS- 873 and XHGS- 1073 should be higher than that of XHGS- 673, but the result is the opposite. The specific capacity values of XHGS- 873 and XHGS- 1073 are 118.8 and 55.6  F g− 1, respectively, at the scan rate of 5  mV s− 1, indicating that the specific capacity value decrease <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> temperature from 673 to 1, 073  K. According to the analysis results of the XRD patterns for XHGS-n, the number of stacking layers increase <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> temperature, that is why the specific capacity values decrease <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> temperature.|$|R
