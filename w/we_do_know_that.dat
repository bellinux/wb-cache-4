25|$|<b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Seleucus {{managed to}} defeat Antigonus {{in at least}} one decisive battle. This battle is only {{mentioned}} in Stratagems in War by Polyaenus. Polyaenus reports that the troops of Seleucus and Antigonus fought for a whole day, but when night came the battle was still undecided. The two forces agreed to rest for the night and continue in the morning. Antigonus' troops slept without their equipment. Seleucus ordered his forces to sleep and eat breakfast in battle formation. Shortly before dawn, Seleucus' troops attacked the forces of Antigonus, who were still without their weapons and in disarray and thus easily defeated. The historical accuracy of the story is questionable.|$|E

40|$|How {{does the}} skeptic {{arrive at the}} {{conclusion}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not <b>know</b> anything about the external world? According to the standard story, the skeptic starts with a particular radical skeptical hypothesis, such as that we are brains-in-vats, and argues <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> it is false; she then uses the principle that knowledge is closed under known entailment to show <b>that</b> since <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the skeptical hypothesis is false, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> an arbitrarily chosen proposition about the world, such as that we have hands, is true.

This paper will discuss a problem concerning {{this part of the}} story that is crucial to understanding epistemological skepticism, a problem that has never been adequately addressed.

2500|$|According to Andreev, Darski and Kharkova (ADK) {{the total}} {{population}} loss due to the war was 26,616,000 (1941-1945) [...] They maintain that between 9-10 million of the total Soviet war dead were due to the worsening of life conditions in the entire USSR, including the region that was not occupied. [...] The total loss of 26.6 million {{is based on the}} assumptions that the wartime increase in infant mortality was 1.3 million and that persons dying of natural causes declined during the war. Overall the annual Mortality rate (persons dying of natural causes) declined from 2.17% in 1940 to 1.58% in 1946The decline in persons dying of natural causes during the war was {{due to the fact that}} a disproportionate number of adults, especially men were killed during the war, than those persons under 18 and women who survived. The figure for births during the war is based on a post war survey of the Total fertility rate which put the number of births during the war at about one half of the prewar level. The main areas of uncertainty were the estimated figures for the population in the territories annexed from 1939–1945 and the loss of population due to emigration during and after the war. The figures include victims of Soviet repression and the deaths of Soviet citizens in German military service. Michael Haynes noted, [...] "We do not know the total number of deaths as a result of the war and related policies". <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the demographic estimate of excess deaths was 26.6 million plus an additional 11.9 million natural deaths of persons born before the war and 4.2 million children born during the war [...] that would have occurred in peacetime, bringing the total dead to 42.7 million. At this time the actual total number of deaths caused by the war is unknown since among the 16.1 million [...] "natural deaths" [...] some would have died peacefully and others as a result of the war.|$|E
2500|$|Buddhism {{is not a}} Japanese native religion, and its {{architecture}} {{arrived from}} the continent via Korea together with the first Buddhists in the 6th century. Officially adopted {{in the wake of}} the Battle of Shigisan in 587, after that date Buddhist temples [...] began to be constructed. Because of the hostility of supporters of local kami beliefs towards Buddhism, no temple of that period survives, so we don't know what they were like. Thanks to the Nihon Shoki, however, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> an architect, six Buddhist priests and an image maker from the Korean kingdom of Paekche came to Japan in 577 to advise the Japanese on the arrangement of monastic buildings. The layout of Ōsaka's Shitennō-ji (see below) reflects the plan of Chongyimsa temple in Buyeo, capital of Paekche from 538 to 663. We know for certain that Soga no Umako built Hōkō-ji, the first temple in Japan, between 588 and 596. It was later renamed as Asuka-dera for Asuka, [...] the name of the capital where it was located. Prince Shōtoku actively promoted Buddhism and [...] ordered the construction of Shitennō-ji in Osaka (593) and Hōryū-ji near his palace in Ikaruga (completed in 603). During this period, temple layout was strictly prescribed and followed mainland styles, with a main gate facing south and the most sacred area surrounded by a semi-enclosed roofed corridor (kairō) accessible through a middle gate (chūmon). The sacred precinct contained a pagoda, which acted as a reliquary for sacred objects, and a main hall (kon-dō). The complex might have other structures such as a lecture hall (kō-dō), a belfry (shōrō), a sūtra repository (kyōzō), priests' and monks' quarters and bathhouses. The ideal temple had a heart formed by seven structures called shichidō garan, or [...] "seven hall temple". Buddhism, and the construction of temples, spread from the capital to outlying areas in the Hakuhō period from 645 to 710. In addition, many temples were built in locations favored by the precepts of Chinese geomancy. The arrangements not only of the buildings, groups of trees and ponds of the compound, but also of mountains and other geographic features in particular directions around the temple played important roles as well.|$|E
