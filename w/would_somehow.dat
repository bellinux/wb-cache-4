25|$|In the pseudoscience of cryptozoology, Hovind {{published}} and co-authored Claws, Jaws, and Dinosaurs with , another Creationist who has searched for dinosaurs in the Congo under {{the belief that}} discovering a cryptid <b>would</b> <b>somehow</b> undermine evolutionary theory and that dinosaurs were dragons. Dinosaur Adventure Land had displays {{about the existence of}} the Loch Ness monster and Beowulf as history rather than legend.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fall}} of the Hasmoneans and the {{subsequent}} Roman occupation, many Jews believed it {{to be the end of}} days and hoped that the Romans <b>would</b> <b>somehow</b> fall or be replaced by a Jewish king. Most Jews believed that their history was governed by God, meaning that even the conquest of Judea by the Romans was a divine act. They believed that the Romans would be replaced by a Jewish king only through divine intervention.|$|E

50|$|The BGP 001 was {{originally}} designed {{with the intention}} of becoming the Honda RA109. In fact, owing to the poor performance of the Honda team in 2008, the team made a relatively early start in designing the 2009 car. However, following Honda's withdrawal, development of the car continued, {{in the hope that the}} team <b>would</b> be <b>somehow</b> rescued.|$|R
25|$|While Larry and Jennifer's romance blossomed, Balki and Mary Anne's {{relationship}} {{moved more}} slowly: the pair would get very close, but then back off after fleeting moments of passion, then drift back into affection. Many viewers' predictions came true {{in the spring}} of 1991 when Larry proposed to Jennifer, after feeling competition from her old flame who was trying to woo her back. Jennifer accepted, and they started planning a wedding. As the 1990–91 season closed, it was clear that despite Larry's impending marriage, he and Balki's relationship <b>would</b> <b>somehow</b> remain a focal point of the show.|$|E
25|$|Beginning {{with the}} 2002–03 season, RDS secured {{exclusive}} French language {{rights to the}} NHL. The deal, negotiated with the Canadiens and not with the league itself, was meant to ensure a consistent home for all Canadiens games. Radio-Canada did not bid for these rights, saying that, as a general-interest network, it could not give up so much airtime to hockey. The announcement drew the ire of, among others, then-Heritage-Minister Sheila Copps, who suggested that the network <b>would</b> <b>somehow</b> be violating its conditions of licence by not airing LSDH. In reality there is no specific regulatory requirement that the CBC's networks carry the NHL, nor that the two networks have {{the same level of}} NHL coverage.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Sullivan {{was working}} inside a ranger station in Shenandoah National Park when another strike occurred. It set his hair on fire; {{he tried to}} smother the flames with his jacket. He then rushed to the restroom, but couldn't fit under the water tap and so used a wet towel instead. Although he never was a fearful man, after the fourth strike he began to believe that some force was trying to destroy him and he {{acquired}} a fear of death. For months, whenever he {{was caught in a}} storm while driving his truck, he would pull over and lie down on the front seat until the storm passed. He also began to believe that he <b>would</b> <b>somehow</b> attract lightning even if he stood in a crowd of people, and carried a can of water with him in case his hair was set on fire.|$|E
60|$|His eyes {{began to}} shine. He insisted. A simple statement,--and {{he thought to}} himself that he <b>would</b> manage <b>somehow</b> to stick in his berth as long as it suited him.

Yankovic was rather upset that a video for [...] "Couch Potato" [...] would not be made, as he felt {{that it would have}} been [...] "the best video that [...] ever done". Yankovic later revealed that the video would have taken on the form a [...] "'patchwork quilt' montage spoofing the most famous scenes from Eminem's videos." ...|$|E
500|$|Handling the film's {{special effects}} were KNB EFX GROUP and the Moving Picture Company (MPC). For Jennifer's demonic form, the creators used {{different}} techniques. [...] "I actually wasn't in [...] that much because they created an entire head. They did a live cast of {{me from the}} shoulders up. They created me and then put the teeth in", stated Fox. [...] "To save my face, they had a photo double that {{would come in and}} do most of the crazy monster makeup - they would do that on her. So it would go from me, then in post-production it <b>would</b> <b>somehow</b> go to her and the fake head. They would mix them all together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Freud's model {{suggested}} that the emotional charge deriving from painful experiences would be consciously repressed {{as a way of}} managing the pain, but that the emotional charge <b>would</b> be <b>somehow</b> [...] "converted" [...] into neurological symptoms. Freud later argued that the repressed experiences were of a sexual nature. As Peter Halligan comments, conversion has [...] "the doubtful distinction among psychiatric diagnoses of still invoking Freudian mechanisms".|$|R

500|$|When {{the season}} finally started, Nowitzki struggled. Played {{as a power}} forward by coach Don Nelson, the 20-year-old felt {{overpowered}} by the more athletic NBA forwards, was intimidated by the expectations as a number nine pick, and played bad defense, causing hecklers to taunt him as [...] "Irk Nowitzki", omitting the [...] "D" [...] which stands for [...] "defense" [...] in basketball slang. He only averaged 8.2 points and 3.4 rebounds in 20.4 minutes of playing time. Looking back, Nowitzki said: [...] "I was so frustrated I even contemplated going back to Germany. ... was like jumping out of an airplane hoping the parachute <b>would</b> <b>somehow</b> open." [...] The Mavericks only won 19 of their 50 games and missed the playoffs, although Nowitzki completed the season with eight double-digit scoring games {{out of the last}} twelve.|$|E
500|$|Some people {{interpreted}} the galactic alignment apocalyptically, claiming that its occurrence <b>would</b> <b>somehow</b> create a combined gravitational effect between the Sun and the supermassive black {{hole at the}} center of our galaxy (known as Sagittarius A*), creating havoc on Earth. Apart from the [...] "galactic alignment" [...] already having happened in 1998, the Sun's apparent path through the zodiac as seen from Earth did not take it near the true galactic center, but rather several degrees above it. Even were this not the case, Sagittarius A* is 30,000 light years from Earth; it would have to have been more than 6 million times closer to cause any gravitational disruption to Earth's Solar System. This reading of the alignment was included on the History Channel documentary Decoding the Past. John Major Jenkins complained that a science fiction writer co-authored the documentary, and he went on to characterize it as [...] "45minutes of unabashed doomsday hype and the worst kind of inane sensationalism".|$|E
2500|$|According to Cronauer, he and Williams were {{forbidden}} by Levinson to {{meet each other}} because the director [...] "was afraid that if Robin and I met, that Robin <b>would</b> <b>somehow</b> start to do an unconscious imitation of me, which would change his characterization."

2500|$|Plans {{called for}} the Freedom Center to share space with the Drawing Center in a {{building}} known as the Cultural Center.

2500|$|A {{key element}} of the single-payer plan that Daschle and his co-authors propose {{in the book is}} a new [...] "Federal Health Board" [...] that would {{establish}} the framework and fill in the details. The board <b>would</b> <b>somehow</b> be simultaneously [...] "insulated from political pressure" [...] and [...] "accountable to elected officials and the American people." [...] The board would [...] "promote 'high-value' medical care by recommending coverage of those drugs and procedures backed by solid evidence." [...] This proposal has been criticized by conservatives and libertarians who argue that such a board will lead to rationing of health care, and by progressives who believe the board will, as one writer put it, [...] "get defanged by lobbyists immediately." ...|$|E

60|$|But no--they fell, {{even more}} rapidly than they rose, till their grace and their cultivation, for them they could not lose, made them the willing ministers to the luxury, the frivolity, the sentimentality, the vice of the whole old world--the Scapia or Figaro of the old world--infinitely able, but with all his ability consecrated {{to the service of}} his own base self.

2500|$|According to Topping, {{this lack}} of {{perspective}} and understanding led Morgan to believe [...] "...that historical facts contain their own meaning, and that the historian’s intellect ought to be active only in internal and external criticism, establishing the authenticity and credibility of sources, yet passive {{when it came to}} establishing the larger significance …" [...] As a result, Morgan [...] "...fell short of the interpretive potential of (his) sources...asserting that the facts <b>would</b> <b>somehow</b> convey their own meaning without any help from him…" [...] However the same focus on fact, coupled to a spectacular memory for detail, allowed him to produce work of breathtaking detail and scope within the field. His strength and greatest contribution was as a documentary rather than synthetic historian.|$|E
2500|$|Both Ritter and Scripps {{believed}} that science {{had become too}} parochial. Many scientists {{had no desire to}} solve human problems or even share their insights with the laity. Many scientists felt that sharing their scientific discoveries with the popular media <b>would</b> <b>somehow</b> soil their pure discovery. Ritter and Scripps, on the other hand, {{believed that}} it was critical to share these scientific discoveries, and by doing so, would help people to [...] "think like a scientist"—with a reasoned thoughtfulness. By the end of 1920, Ritter and Scripps had {{come to the conclusion that}} a newspaper would be the best avenue for sharing these scientific discoveries. With Scripps funding, and Ritter as the scientific director, they started the Science Service in Washington DC, using a newspaper format (now Science News) to share science information and discoveries.|$|E

[...] "Even people who are extremely critical of their own government, and there are many Chinese who are very critical of their own government, even those people are filled with a sense of pride that China is hosting these Olympics. Many of them have taken the view that those who <b>would</b> <b>somehow</b> boycott the Olympics are doing so out of a desire to keep China down and otherwise humiliate and embarrass China. So it is an issue with great public resonance in China, going well beyond the question of the government." ...|$|E
