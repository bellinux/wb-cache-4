Rihanna tells the boy not to tell anyone <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going,</b> and the singer and her friends sneak {{into the back of}} the store (where there is a secret nightclub entrance). The narrative is intercut with Rihanna singing the song against a wall and dancing in the club. After she enters the club, she checks her makeup in a restroom as she sings.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kyle invites Stan, Cartman, and Kenny to {{his younger}} brother Ike's bris. When they learn more about what a bris is, and misconstrue it as a party <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to remove his penis, Kyle tries {{to find a way}} to hide his brother from his parents and the {{circumcision}} process. Kyle puts Ike on a train to Nebraska and makes an Ike-style doll out of meat bones in an attempt to not arouse his parents' suspicions. This backfires when the doll is eaten by a dog, which leads to them to think that Ike is dead. It is at the funeral that Kyle finds out that Ike is not his biological brother, but was adopted from Canada due to the tombstone featuring the Canadian flag. Upon discovering this, Kyle decides that Ike is no longer his brother. His parents are shocked after Kyle reveals the truth, and Ike is retrieved from Nebraska.|$|E

Tangaballi catches Rahul as he tries to leave, but the villagers help them escape again. Meena persuades Rahul to {{disperse}} his grandfather's ashes and travels with him to Rameswaram, where they complete the rites. On their way back, Rahul realises that he has fallen in love with Meena, and does not tell her <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going.</b> He takes Meena back to her father and tries to make him understand and honour his daughter's wish. He also tells Meena that he loves her. Rahul tells Tangaballi and his goons that he is ready for the fight this time. In the fight that follows, Rahul is severely injured but emerges victorious. Meena's father and Tangaballi reform, accepting that the love of a common man like Rahul is bigger than their physical ability and political influence. Azhagusundaram allows Rahul to marry Meena. Rahul then leaves a message that love knows no regional or language barriers and that with a strong heart, there is no limit to what the common man can achieve.|$|E

The vineyard keeper promises to relieve her suffering in exchange for 100 gold coins, and Ianulea subsequently fulfills his promise. He scolds Negoiță for accepting such a small amount, and informs that he should make his way for Craiova, <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to repeat their act with {{the daughter of a}} local administrator, the kaymakam. This happens exactly as predicted by the devil, who, upon exiting the girl's body, informs the peasant that he no longer considers himself indebted.|$|E
25|$|As aforementioned, genba is agreeably one of {{the most}} {{prominent}} and core place for hip hop in Japan, there is however a visible shift and spread/increase of Japanese hip hop venues. Among these are clubs, crowds on streets and many more. According to Ian Condry, in his book he outlines the idea and fact that, clubs have become {{one of the}} most convenient and top promoting places for Japanese hip hop. Great Djs and turntable-lists use clubs to as venues to not promote other rappers, by that spreading the hip-hop culture, bring and promote new songs and their own hip hop work. Referring to some sources such as, the above named source is a Japanese hip hop forum that also focuses on clubs in Japan. The above source also services proof of Dj and upcoming artists naming places, clubs, Street gatherings of <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to be so as to promote their work or any artist they are interested in. The above all in all justifies the view that Japanese Hip hop venues are not just genba but have rather taken and shift or taking a shift into a variety of places such as the ones named above.|$|E

25|$|The Coen brothers' next film, O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), {{was another}} {{critical}} and commercial success. The title was {{borrowed from the}} Preston Sturges film Sullivan's Travels (1941), whose lead character, movie director John Sullivan, had planned {{to make a film}} with that title. Based loosely on Homer's Odyssey (complete with a cyclops, sirens, et al.), the story is set in Mississippi in the 1930s and follows a trio of escaped convicts who, after absconding from a chain gang, journey home to recover bank-heist loot the leader has buried—but they have no clear perception of <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going.</b> The film highlighted the comic abilities of George Clooney as the oddball lead character Ulysses Everett McGill, and of Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro, his sidekicks. The film's bluegrass and old-time soundtrack, offbeat humor and digitally desaturated cinematography made it a critical and commercial hit. It was the first feature film to use all-digital color grading. The film's soundtrack CD was also successful, spawning a concert and concert/documentary DVD, Down from the Mountain, that coincided with a resurgence in interest in American folk music.|$|E

500|$|The {{graphics}} {{were seen}} {{as one of the}} strongest aspects of the game. Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot wrote: [...] "graphically, Banjo-Kazooie takes it to another level. The game maintains {{the look and feel of}} Mario 64, but instead of flat, shaded polygons, [...] uses a lot of textures". The game's long draw distance, solid frame rate, special lighting, transparency effects, and animations were also highlighted very positively. Critics also praised the game's dynamic soundtrack. Schneider remarked that it [...] "lets players know <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going.</b> This happens all the time and in every level. It's all very Disney-esque." [...] The sound effects received similar praise, with several editors crediting the unique and diverse speech patterns of the characters.|$|E

2500|$|The 3-point {{shot was}} adopted nationally in the NCAA in 1986, midway through Knight's {{coaching}} career. Although he opposed the rule change throughout his life, it did complement his offense well by improving the spacing on the floor.

[...] Knight's offense also emphasized a two-count. Players in the post are expected to try to post in the paint for two seconds and if they don't receive the ball they go set a screen.

2500|$|Brodsky’s third book, The Inside Story, {{began as}} an off-hand comment from a friend. Brodsky asked if her friend would like Brodsky to mail some letters for her, and the friend responded, [...] "they'll be very happy." [...] This led Brodsky to imagine happy letters, excited to go <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going.</b> Rebecca Rule writes in her review {{that it is a}} story [...] "about what happens on those {{occasions}} (rare these days, it seems) when one writes and mails a personal letter, told {{from the point of view}} of an envelope." [...] This gave Brodsky an opportunity to broach the idea of change and how children can best understand and cope with it. Brodsky explains: [...] "Even though the story is an adventure about recycling and the mail system, I think the main theme is about change. Change is difficult for all of us. Kids often deal with change -- in school, in their families, in their neighborhoods." [...] For its discussion of recycling, the book received a national citation from the Green Book Festival in San Francisco.|$|E
2500|$|Other open {{questions}} of shoaling behaviour include identifying which individuals {{are responsible for}} the direction of shoal movement. In the case of migratory movement, most members of a shoal seem to know <b>where</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>going.</b> Observations on the foraging behaviour of captive golden shiner (a kind of minnow) found they formed shoals which were led by a small number of experienced individuals who knew when and where food was available. If all golden shiners in a shoal have similar knowledge of food availability, there are a few individuals that still emerge as natural leaders (being at the front more often) and behavioural tests suggest they are naturally bolder. [...] Smaller golden shiners appear more willing than larger ones to be near the front of the shoal, perhaps because they are hungrier. Observations on the common roach have shown that food-deprived individuals tend to be at the front of a shoal, where they obtain more food [...] but where they may also be more vulnerable to ambush predators. Individuals that are wary of predation tend to seek more central positions within shoals.|$|E
