2500|$|A {{country where}} {{resources}} were scarce and tropical disease was rampant, Barotseland offered comparatively few economic {{opportunities for the}} Company and little incentive for white immigration. The main objective of Lochner's expedition was all along to clear a path towards Katanga, a mineral-rich area further north, where Msiri ruled the Yeke Kingdom. Katanga was also coveted by {{the owner of the}} Congo Free State, King Leopold II of the Belgians, whose representatives Rhodes hoped to beat there. [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Msiri's," [...] Rhodes told one of his agents, Joseph Thomson; [...] "I mean Katanga ... You must go and get Katanga." ...|$|E

[...] Reynolds did indeed work young professional hard.

2500|$|In Katanga, the Nyamwezi trader Msiri {{had seized}} power around 1860, {{expanding}} his empire {{to cover a}} large part of the Luapula valley. By the time of Delcommune's expedition his rule had greatly contracted, but both the Belgians in the free State and the British in Southern Africa were determined to fully control the mineral-rich area of Katanga. Msiri refused to make any formal treaty with either power. Cecil Rhodes had told an agent of the British South Africa Company [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Msiri's. I mean Katanga... You must go and get Katanga". A small force of Belgians from an expedition led by Paul Le Marinel had been allowed to establish a post near to Msiri's capital early in 1891.|$|E

2500|$|Coffman was {{promptly}} {{called up to}} Detroit and joined the Tigers in Philadelphia, and Cochrane told Coffman that he would pitch {{the first game of}} a series in Boston.
