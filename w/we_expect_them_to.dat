[...] At the time ENO had accumulated an £800,000 deficit, exacerbated by reductions in public subsidy; The Times commented that the incoming music director had a reputation for [...] "steely, even abrasive determination" [...] and that he would need it. From late 2014 the company went through a further organisational crisis. The chairman, Martyn Rose, resigned after two years in the post, following irreconcilable differences with Berry. Henriette Götz, the company's executive director, who had a series of public disagreements with Berry, resigned soon after. In February 2015, the Arts Council of England announced the unprecedented step of removing ENO from the national portfolio of 670 arts organisations that receive regular funding, and instead offered [...] "special funding arrangements" [...] because of continuing concerns over ENO's business plan and management. The council recognised that the company was [...] "capable of extraordinary artistic work", but [...] "we have serious concerns about their governance and business model and <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> improve or they could face removal of funding." [...] In March 2015 Cressida Pollock, a management consultant, was named the interim CEO of ENO. [...] In July 2015, Berry resigned as artistic director of ENO.|$|E

According to Kornhaber, the song showcases [...] "how distinctive her timbre and phrasing is", something that wasn't heard on her previous songs like the 2010 single [...] "Only Girl (In the World)". Travis Grier of Def Pen Radio thought that the song {{is a good choice}} for Rihanna to achieve legendary status, as, [...] "she's tackled pretty much every genre under the sun and 'FourFiveSeconds' just expands her versatility even more". Crotty of Elle wrote that the song is [...] "awesome" [...] and [...] "sweet". [...] In June 2015, Jason Lipshutz of Billboard named [...] "FourFiveSeconds" [...] one of the [...] "10 Best Songs of 2015 (So Far)" [...] stating [...] "It's the end of June, and we're still waiting for the new Rihanna and Kanye West albums… as well as some indication that either will be coming soon.

The maximum acceptable rates of complications and conversions, however, were lower among nurses as among patients. Since the nurses did not experience the necessity for hysterectomy and are professionally involved in patients having complications, this might be the explanation for the difference in willingness to accept these adverse events.|$|R

40|$|We {{aimed to}} predict how hard {{subjects}} work for financial rewards from their general trait and state reward-motivation.

Each trial of our task contained a 1 second earning interval in which male subjects earned money for each button press. This was preceded by one of three predictive cues: an erotic picture of a woman, a man, or a geometric figure. We found that individuals high in trait "reward responsiveness" worked harder and earned more, irrespective of the predictive cue. Because female predictive cues are more rewarding, <b>we</b> <b>expected</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> increase general motivation in our male subjects and invigorate work, but found a more complex pattern...|$|R
40|$|Before {{deploying}} {{a software}} system {{we need to}} assure ourselves (and stakeholders) that the system will behave correctly. This assurance is usually done by testing the system. However, it is intuitively obvious that adaptive systems, including agent-based systems, can exhibit complex behaviour, and are thus harder to test. In this paper we examine this “obvious intuition ” {{in the case of}} Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents. We analyse the size of the behaviour space of BDI agents and show that although the intuition is correct, the factors that influence the size are not what <b>we</b> <b>expected</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be. Specifically, <b>we</b> found that the introduction of failure handling had a much larger effect {{on the size of the}} behaviour space than <b>we</b> <b>expected.</b> <b>We</b> also discuss the implications of these findings on the testability of BDI agents. 1...|$|R
60|$|As to {{the smaller}} details of this life beyond, it is better perhaps not to treat them, for the very good reason that they are small details. We will learn them all soon for ourselves, {{and it is only}} vain curiosity which leads us to ask for them now. One thing is clear: there are higher intelligences over yonder to whom {{synthetic}} chemistry, which not only makes the substance but moulds the form, is a matter of absolute ease. We see them at work in the coarser media, perceptible to our material senses, in the seance room. If they can build up simulacra in the seance room, how much may <b>we</b> <b>expect</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> do when they are working upon ethereal objects in that ether which is their own medium. It may be said generally that they can make something which is analogous to anything which exists upon earth. How they do it may well be a matter of guess and speculation among the less advanced spirits, as the phenomena of modern science are a matter of guess and speculation to us. If one of us were suddenly called up by the denizen of some sub-human world, and were asked to explain exactly what gravity is, or what magnetism is, how helpless we should be! We may put ourselves in the position, then, of a young engineer soldier like Raymond Lodge, who tries to give some theory of matter in the beyond--a theory which is very likely contradicted by some other spirit who is also guessing at things above him. He may be right, or he may be wrong, but he is doing his best to say what he thinks, as we should do in similar case. He believes that his transcendental chemists can make anything, and that even such unspiritual matter as alcohol or tobacco could come within their powers and could still be craved for by unregenerate spirits. This has tickled the critics {{to such an extent that}} one would really think to read the comments that it was the only statement in a book which contains 400 closely-printed pages. Raymond may be right or wrong, but the only thing which the incident proves to me is the unflinching courage and honesty of the man who chronicled it, knowing well the handle that he was giving to his enemies.|$|E

40|$|When {{different}} groups create models or ontologies {{of the same}} knowledge domain, this creates challenges for knowledge sharing.

These ontologies all model the physical anatomy of a cell, and <b>we</b> <b>expected</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> be similar in scope.

These differences represent variations based on theory-driven vs. emergent construction, as well as differences in how small application ontologies like the CCO are created from reference ontologies.

40|$|Typically, arousal {{increases}} when {{telling a}} lie, {{as indicated in}} psychophysiological studies about lie detection. But the emotional valence induced by lying is unknown, though intuition indicates {{that it may be}} negative. Indeed, the Electrodermal Activity (EDA), used in such studies, only shows arousal changes during an emotional response. In this study, we examined the emotional valence induced by lying using two tasks. First, in the deceptive task, participants answered “no” to every question regarding the nature of displayed playing cards. Therefore, they told a lie about specific cards. During the task, their EDA was recorded. Secondly, in the figure estimation task, they assessed pictures by “like” or “dislike” after looking at playing cards visibly or subliminally as prime stimuli. <b>We</b> <b>expected</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> tend to estimate figures by “dislike” when cards relevant to deception were previously shown. This would mean that an affective priming effect due to telling a lie happened. Actually, this effect was found only when prime stimuli were displayed visibly. This result suggests that lying per se induces negative emotions even without motivation or punishment due to lying. Furthermore, we found that such effect was more blatant in participants whose EDA changes were salient while lying...|$|R
