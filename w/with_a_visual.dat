5|$|A {{decompression}} trapeze is {{a device}} used in recreational diving and technical diving to make decompression stops {{more comfortable and}} more secure and provide the divers' surface cover <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>visual</b> reference for the divers' position. It consists of a horizontal bar or bars suspended at the depth of intended decompression stops by buoys. The bars are of sufficient weight and the buoys of sufficient buoyancy that the trapeze will not easily change depth in turbulent water or if the divers experience buoyancy control problems.|$|E

5|$|Phoenix {{contains}} HE0107-5240, possibly one of {{the oldest}} stars yet discovered. It has around 1/200,000 the metallicity that the Sun has and hence must have formed very early {{in the history of the}} universe. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>visual</b> magnitude of 15.17, it is around 10,000 times dimmer than the faintest stars visible to the naked eye and is 36000 light years distant.|$|E
5|$|Visual Impairment – Athletes {{with visual}} {{impairment}} ranging from partial vision, sufficient to be judged legally blind, to total blindness. This includes impairment {{of one or more}} component of the visual system (eye structure, receptors, optic nerve pathway, and visual cortex). The sighted guides for athletes <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>visual</b> impairment are such a close and essential part of the competition that the athlete {{with visual impairment}} and the guide are considered a team. Beginning in 2012, these guides (along with sighted goalkeepers in 5-a-side football became eligible to receive medals of their own.|$|E
5|$|Marking {{the heart}} of the serpent is the constellation's {{brightest}} star, Alpha Serpentis. Traditionally called Unukalhai, is a red giant of spectral type K2III located approximately 23 parsecs distant <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>visual</b> magnitude of 2.630 ± 0.009, meaning it can easily be seen with the naked eye even in areas with substantial light pollution. A faint companion is in orbit around the red giant star, although it is not visible to the naked eye. Situated near Alpha is Lambda Serpentis, a magnitude 4.42 ± 0.05 star rather similar to the Sun positioned only 12 parsecs away. Another solar analog in Serpens is the primary of Psi Serpentis, a binary star located slightly further away at approximately 14 parsecs.|$|E

50|$|It is {{important}} to notice that a change of 10% in an object´s dimension is clearly perceivable at first sight, {{as it is the}} overall distortion <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 60° <b>visual</b> angle or the maximum punctual distortion <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 50° <b>visual</b> angle. To avoid this excessive distortion, the visual angle of the observer should be always under 40°, and the closer it is to 30°, the better.|$|R

5|$|<b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>visual</b> {{magnitude}} of 17.3, Haumea is the third-brightest {{object in the}} Kuiper belt after Pluto and , and easily observable with a large amateur telescope. However, because the planets and most small Solar System bodies share a common orbital alignment from their formation in the primordial disk of the Solar System, most early surveys for distant objects focused on the projection on the sky of this common plane, called the ecliptic. As the region of sky close to the ecliptic became well explored, later sky surveys began looking for objects that had been dynamically excited into orbits with higher inclinations, {{as well as more}} distant objects, with slower mean motions across the sky. These surveys eventually covered the location of Haumea, with its high orbital inclination and current position far from the ecliptic.|$|E
5|$|Hatoful Boyfriend is {{the first}} game {{developed}} by manga artist and writer Hato Moa—author of the series Vairocana and a former Dengeki Comic Grand Prix honoree—under her dōjin circle PigeoNation Inc. As she had no experience with game development prior to Hatoful, Hato initially wanted to start <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>visual</b> novel, as she believed it was an easier game type for amateur developers to make; the format also allowed visuals to easily accompany her stories, something that she, as a manga artist, was accustomed to and viewed as being necessary in her work. She first {{came up with the}} concept for Hatoful as a 2011 April Fools' Day joke: despite her lack of familiarity with the genre, she initially intended to create a parody of otome game stereotypes. Birds in particular were used as a theme due to Hato's fondness for pigeons; however, this was also partially due to Hato's prioritization of writing over illustrating, as the use of bird photographs instead of hand-drawn sprites allowed her more freedom to focus on the script. The first incarnation of the game was created over the course of half a day and posted as a browser game made with Adobe Flash; but due to strong word of mouth from social media it was taken down after immense traffic caused the web server it was hosted on to crash on two separate occasions. Following the unexpected popularity of the Flash game, development began on a longer visual novel using the FamousWriter game engine.|$|E

25|$|The {{surface of}} Tethys {{is one of}} the most {{reflective}} (at visual wavelengths) in the Solar System, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>visual</b> albedo of 1.229. This very high albedo is the result of the sandblasting of particles from Saturn's E-ring, a faint ring composed of small, water-ice particles generated by Enceladus's south polar geysers. The radar albedo of the Tethyan surface is also very high. The leading hemisphere of Tethys is brighter by 10–15% than the trailing one.|$|E
25|$|Assessment of {{the lower}} {{extremities}} begins <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>visual</b> inspection. Color, presence of hair, visible veins, size and any sores or ulcerations are noted. Lack of hair may indicate an arterial circulation problem. Given swelling, the calf circumference is measured for reference as time continues. Elevating the legs may reduce or eliminate the swelling. Palpation of the ankle can determine the degree of swelling. Assessment includes {{a check of the}} popliteal, femoral, posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses. The inguinal nodes may be enlarged. Enlargement of the nodes lasting more than three weeks may indicate infection or some other disease process requiring further medical attention.|$|E
25|$|Lanci's {{most notable}} {{achievement}} was his invention in 1567 {{of a piece}} of surveying equipment to obtain perspectives <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>visual</b> field of 180°. The instrument, which he named distanziometro ("distance meter"), was made of a circular bronze plate placed upon a horizontal tripod the height of which could be adjusted. Semi-cylindrical paper was wound around its edge. A cylindrical eyepiece was placed in the centre with a retracting metal needle or pen underneath. The eyepiece was high enough to overlook the semicircle of paper and sight points of interest while the retracting needle scored on the paper to accurately plot the subject. It could also be used as a quadrant for measuring height {{in much the same way}} as the orizzonte designed by Leon Battista Alberti.|$|E
