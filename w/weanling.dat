5|$|Foal: A {{horse of}} either sex {{less than one}} year old. A nursing foal is {{sometimes}} called a suckling and a foal that has been weaned is called a <b>weanling.</b> Most domesticated foals are weaned at five to seven months of age, although foals can be weaned at four months with no adverse physical effects.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, Marguerite Henry {{released}} the children's book Misty of Chincoteague, {{the first in}} a series of novels that made the Chincoteague breed internationally famous. The real Misty was foaled on Chincoteague Island in 1946, and was purchased as a <b>weanling</b> by Henry. In 1961, the publicity was increased even more when the film Misty was made, based on the book. The publicity generated by the books assisted the Chincoteague Fire Department and the breed in remaining viable into the 21st century. While fictionalized, the books were based on a real horse and ranch on Chincoteague Island, and the Misty of Chincoteague Foundation was established in 1990, to preserve the Beebe Ranch and establish a museum with memorabilia from the series. Model horse company Breyer Animal Creations has created models of Misty and five of her descendants. As of 2001, there were around 40 surviving descendants of Misty worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Nyquist {{went through}} the sales ring three times, first as a <b>weanling</b> at Keeneland November, selling for $180,000. Next he sold as a {{yearling}} at the Keeneland September auction for $230,000. At two, he sold at the Fasig-Tipton March sale for $400,000 to Dennis O'Neill {{on behalf of his}} brother, trainer Doug O'Neill. Days after he won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, Darley America purchased his breeding rights and upon retirement Nyquist will stand at Jonabell Farm in Lexington, Kentucky.|$|E
25|$|Binger was a horse man {{who played}} polo on weekends. He and Virginia took over {{operations}} of her father's Tartan Farm in Ocala, Florida, in 1974, and became its owners when Virginia's {{father died in}} 1978. During their stewardship, Tartan Farm bred 1980 Preakness Stakes winner Codex and 1990 three-year-old champion and Kentucky Derby winner Unbridled. The Bingers also bred and owned 1978 champion sprinter Dr. Patches, a son of McKnight's horse Dr. Fager. Tartan dispersed {{the majority of its}} horses at the 1987 Fasig-Tipton Kentucky November sale, including Unbridled, who sold as a <b>weanling</b> for $70,000.|$|E
25|$|Eri-Aaroni was foaled in July 12, 1932. He was bred by Sulo Rintala in Seinäjoki. He was by a {{stallion}} {{who was a}} Ravikuningas title {{winner and}} tähtijuoksija named Murto 2306, {{and out of the}} mare Upeva 1640-V, a 50.0-timed, well-conformed broodmare. The colt was brought as a <b>weanling</b> to Turku, and then purchased by, Albin Ahlqvist, who took him to Åland. Eri-Aaroni grew to be a handsome and noble-looking horse who differed from the contemporary ideals of Finnhorse breeding, which favored a stockier, work horse look. Ahlqvist raced Eri-Aaroni occasionally at Turku. Eri-Aaroni was noticed there, and horse dealer Matti Takanen bought him from Ahlqvist for 75000 Finnish marks. Then, in 1937, the well-known horseman Fritz Buttenhoff bought the now 5-year-old Eri-Aaroni from Takanen for 100000 marks, corresponding to c. 34000 Euros, and took the stallion to his estate in Vyborg.|$|E
500|$|American Pharoah's {{first crop}} of foals were greeted with enthusiasm at the November 2017 Fasig-Tipton and Keeneland Sales, {{including}} a <b>weanling</b> filly who sold for $1 million.

500|$|Poco Pine {{was shown}} {{about five times}} as a <b>weanling,</b> winning all the halter classes he was shown in. Curtner, however, {{felt that he was}} slow to develop and {{therefore}} didn't show him as a yearling or as a two-year-old. By 1957 Curtner felt that Poco Pine was once again ready to perform, and took him to a show in Fort Worth, Texas. Although Poco Pine won his class, Curtner was sure the horse wouldn't win either Grand Champion or Reserve Grand Champion, and ended up betting B. F. Phillips and Billy Bush that Poco Pine would not win the championship or reserve. [...] Poco Pine won the Championship, which meant that Curtner lost money on his horse winning.|$|E
500|$|Before Skipper W was born, Wiescamp had {{attempted}} to sell Hired Girl while {{she was pregnant with}} the colt, but at $150 (approximately $ in [...] ), did not get any buyers. While the colt was a <b>weanling,</b> Wiescamp priced him at $500 (approximately $ in [...] ), and the one potential purchaser decided it was too high a price for a colt the buyer planned to make into a gelding. When Skipper W was a yearling, another possible buyer, who was wanting a potential breeding stallion, looked at the colt, but when they found out that Wiescamp wanted $1500 (approximately $ in [...] ) for the horse decided against purchasing. Instead, Skipper W never sold and spent his entire life with Wiescamp.|$|E
500|$|The only {{exception}} to this rule are ponies competing in lead line classes. Over 20 World Championships are awarded in different classes {{throughout the course of}} the Celebration, including the Lead Line Ponies World Championship, Park Performance, Four-Year-Old, Three-Year-Old, Two-Year-Old, <b>Weanling,</b> Trail Pleasure, Show Pleasure, and Lite Shod. The most anticipated class, however, is the World Grand Championship, the largest honor in the Tennessee Walking Horse breed. [...] Competition at the Celebration is traditionally opened each night by a white or gray Tennessee Walking Horse and rider carrying the American flag, during the singing of the American national anthem.

500|$|Prices of Thoroughbreds vary greatly, {{depending}} on age, pedigree, conformation, and other market factors. [...] In 2007, Keeneland Sales, a United States-based sales company, sold 9,124 horses at auction, {{with a total}} value of $814,401,000, which gives an average price of $89,259. As a whole for the United States in 2007, The Jockey Club auction statistics indicated that the average <b>weanling</b> sold for $44,407, the average yearling sold for $55,300, average sale price for two-year-olds was $61,843, broodmares averaged $70,150, and horses over two and broodmare prospects sold {{for an average of}} $53,243.

500|$|Under such an arrangement, Chenery {{sent two}} mares to be bred to Bold Ruler in 1968, Hasty Matelda and Somethingroyal. She then sent Cicada and Somethingroyal in 1969. The foal-sharing {{agreement}} {{stated that the}} winner of the coin toss would get first foal pick of the foals produced in 1969, while the loser of the toss would get first pick of the foals due in 1970. In the spring of 1969, a colt and filly were produced. In the 1969 breeding season, Cicada did not conceive, leaving only one foal due in the spring of 1970. Thus, {{the winner of the}} coin toss would get only one foal (the first pick from 1969), and the loser would get two (the second pick from 1969 and the only foal from 1970). Chenery later said that both owners hoped they would lose the coin toss, which was held in the fall of 1969 in the office of New York Racing Association Chairman Alfred G. Vanderbilt II, with Arthur [...] "Bull" [...] Hancock of Claiborne Farm as witness. Ogden Phipps won the toss and took the 1969 <b>weanling</b> filly out of Somethingroyal. The filly was named The Bride and never won a race, though she did later become a stakes producer. Chenery received the Hasty Matelda colt in 1969 and the as-yet-unborn 1970 foal of Somethingroyal, {{which turned out to be}} Secretariat.|$|E
2500|$|Sunday Silence was foaled March 25, 1986, by Halo out of Wishing Well by Understanding. Though he was {{registered}} as a dark bay/brown, {{he was in}} fact a true black. [...] He was bred by Oak Cliff Thoroughbreds, Ltd. and escaped death twice: first as a <b>weanling</b> when he nearly died from a freak virus; and later at age two, traveling in a van when the driver experienced a heart attack and the van flipped over. [...] He was passed over twice at the sales ring as a yearling before he was sold in California for $50,000 as a two-year-old in training. Arthur B. Hancock III bought him as a [...] "buy-back" [...] (he had bred him), hoping to ship him to Kentucky. However, the van accident kept Sunday Silence in California.

60|$|A glance {{into the}} bathroom, with its sunken Roman bath and {{descending}} marble steps, was fruitless, {{as were the}} glances he sent into Paula's wardrobe room and dressing room. He passed the short, broad stairway that led to her empty window-seat divan in what she called her Juliet Tower, and thrilled at sight of an orderly disarray of filmy, pretty, lacy woman's things that he knew she had spread out for her own sensuous delight of contemplation. He fetched up {{for a moment at}} a drawing easel, his reiterant cry checked on his lips, and threw a laugh of recognition and appreciation at the sketch, just outlined, of an awkward, big-boned, knobby, <b>weanling</b> colt caught in the act of madly whinneying for its mother.|$|E

[...] Bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies, [...] The tufted crow-toe, and pale jessamine, [...] The white pink, and the pansy freaked with jet, [...] The glowing violet, [...] 145 [...] The musk-rose, and the well-attired woodbine, [...] With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head, [...] And every flower that sad embroidery wears; [...] Bid amaranthus all his beauty shed, [...] And daffadillies fill their cups with tears, [...] 150 [...] To strew the laureate hearse where Lycid lies. [...] For so, to interpose a little ease, [...] Let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise.

[...] Weep no more, woeful shepherds, weep no more, [...] 165 [...] For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead, [...] Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor. [...] So sinks the day-star in the ocean bed, [...] And yet anon repairs his drooping head, [...] And tricks his beams, and with new-spangled ore [...] 170 [...] Flames in the forehead of the morning sky: [...] So Lycidas sunk low, but mounted high, [...] Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves, [...] Where, other groves and other streams along, [...] With nectar pure his oozy locks he laves, [...] 175 [...] And hears the unexpressive nuptial song, [...] In the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love. [...] There entertain him all the Saints above, [...] In solemn troops, and sweet societies, [...] That sing, and singing in their glory move, [...] 180 [...] And wipe the tears forever from his eyes.
