500|$|... "Hero" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey. It was released on October 19, 1993, via Columbia Records as the second single from Carey's third studio album, Music Box (1993). Originally intended for Gloria Estefan, the song was written by Mariah and produced by her and Walter Afanasieff. While writing the song, Carey did not connect to its style or sound, therefore forfeiting {{it over to the}} soundtrack of the film of the same name. However, after being convinced to keep it, she personalized it, giving it a more pop and R melody, as well as changing some of the lyrics to more precisely fit her personality.
