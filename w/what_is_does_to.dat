It had been shown that this effect affects text comprehension, but is it unclear <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>does</b> <b>to</b> credibility. To find out, the main question is asked: “Do the phonetic effects of a smile affect the credibility of an utterance?” In this study there have been made recordings of several sentences, all produced with and without a smile on the speakers face. These recordings were judged on credibility by a collection of test subjects. The study has shown that sentenced uttered with a smile were regarded as less credible. This is why the main question is answered with “the phonetic effects caused by a smile affect the credibility of an utterance in a negative way”. When a speaker is trying to convince a listener, speaking with a smile will make things harder for him...|$|E

We have also investigated how the objectified view on women plays a big role concerning trafficking. We have investigated the course of trafficking, and in addition, on what basis trafficking occurs, how it unfolds and <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> prevent it. We have used feminist theory to explain the sexual exploitation of women, and compared two NGOs <b>to</b> show <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> <b>to</b> exterminate trafficking. We {{have found that the}} sexual exploitation of women is a consequence of the patriarchal domination, and also that globalization is an significant negative factor in the expansion of trafficking.
