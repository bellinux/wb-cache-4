5|$|Most {{palladium}} is {{used for}} catalytic converters in the automobile industry. In the run up to year 2000, the Russian supply of palladium to the global market was repeatedly delayed and disrupted because for political reasons, the export quota was not granted on time. The ensuing market panic drove the price to an all-time high of $1100 per troy ounce in January 2001. Around that time, the Ford Motor Company, fearing that automobile production would be disrupted by a palladium shortage, stockpiled the metal. <b>When</b> <b>prices</b> fell in early 2001, Ford lost nearly US$1billion.|$|E
5|$|Duration: For most goods, {{the longer}} a price change holds, {{the higher the}} {{elasticity}} is likely to be, {{as more and more}} consumers find they have the time and inclination to search for substitutes. When fuel prices increase suddenly, for instance, consumers may still fill up their empty tanks in the short run, but <b>when</b> <b>prices</b> remain high over several years, more consumers will reduce their demand for fuel by switching to carpooling or public transportation, investing in vehicles with greater fuel economy or taking other measures. This does not hold for consumer durables such as the cars themselves, however; eventually, it may become necessary for consumers to replace their present cars, so one would expect demand to be less elastic.|$|E
5|$|Other {{pressures}} on O'Neill's colonization plan were {{the high cost}} of access to Earth orbit and the declining cost of energy. Building solar power stations in space was economically attractive when energy prices spiked during the 1979 oil crisis. <b>When</b> <b>prices</b> dropped in the early 1980s, funding for space solar power research dried up. His plan had also been based on NASA's estimates for the flight rate and launch cost of the Space Shuttle, numbers that turned out to have been wildly optimistic. His 1977 book quoted a Space Shuttle launch cost of $10 million, but in 1981 the subsidized price given to commercial customers started at $38 million. Eventual accounting of the full cost of a launch in 1985 raised this as high as $180 million per flight.|$|E

50|$|The use of Bollinger Bands {{varies widely}} among traders.

Other traders buy <b>when</b> <b>price</b> breaks above the upper Bollinger Band or sell <b>when</b> <b>price</b> falls below the lower Bollinger Band. Moreover, the use of Bollinger Bands is not {{confined}} to stock traders; options traders, most notably implied volatility traders, often sell options when Bollinger Bands are historically far apart or buy options when the Bollinger Bands are historically close together, in both instances, expecting volatility to revert towards the average historical volatility level for the stock.|$|R

40|$|Loyalty and {{fairness}} are major research topics in the marketing literature. However, research examining how customer loyalty {{and fairness}} perceptions affect {{each other is}} lacking. This study examines these two topics {{in the context of}} a retailer increasing its prices, develops hypotheses, and tests these hypotheses using an experimental design approach. Results indicate that loyalty has a positive effect on fairness perceptions <b>when</b> <b>price</b> increases are low, though no such effect is found <b>when</b> <b>price</b> increases are high. Also, justifiable reasons for price increases lead to increased fairness perceptions <b>when</b> <b>price</b> increases are low, but any reason offered <b>when</b> <b>price</b> increases are high increases fairness perceptions. Whether distributive or procedural fairness influences post customer loyalty in the presence of price increases is dependent on both the level of the price increase and the reason offered for the price increase.

25|$|The {{event-driven}} SOA software could {{shut off}} the heating element of water heaters to the pre-set response limits established by individual homeowners. For example, if the market price of electricity for a given hour exceeded the home owner's limit, the home owner could plan to go without recharging the water's hot temperature for that hour, <b>when</b> <b>prices</b> were high, and opt to delay the hot water temperature recharge to the next hour when electricity market prices might be lower.|$|E
25|$|In {{general as}} {{we see in the}} graph below, high gas prices are {{typically}} associated to low storage periods. Usually <b>when</b> <b>prices</b> are high during the early months of the refill season (April–October), many users of storage adopt a wait and see attitude. They limit their gas intake in anticipation that the prices will drop before the heating season begins (November–March). However, when that decrease does not occur, they are forced to buy natural gas at high prices. This is particularly true for Local Distribution and other operators who rely on storage to meet the seasonal demand for their customers. On the other hand, other storage users, who use storage as a marketing tool (hedging or speculating) will hold off storing a lot of gas when the prices are high.|$|E

25|$|Regional {{differences}} in mortality rates {{were influenced by}} several factors, including the effects of migration and of natural disasters immediately prior to {{the onset of the}} famine. In general, excess mortality was higher in the east, even though the relative shortfall in the rice crop was worst in the western districts of Bengal. Eastern districts were relatively densely populated (and incidentally had higher Muslim populations), were closest to the Burma war zone, and normally ran grain deficits in pre-famine times. These also were subject to the boat denial policy and had relatively high jute production. Workers in eastern districts were more likely to receive monetary wages than payment in kind with a portion of the harvest, unlike in the western districts. <b>When</b> <b>prices</b> rose sharply, their wages failed to follow suit; this drop in real wages left them less able to purchase food.|$|E
25|$|A true professional, {{she would}} spend months {{preparing}} the new character types {{she wanted to}} represent on stage. These roles had a slightly mocking edge, furthering her popularity among the working class men in her audience. She was wildly popular among women as well, who viewed her {{as a symbol of}} independence. Newspaper reports of her performances emphasised how popular she was throughout the country, drawing capacity crowds in England, Scotland, Ireland, the Isle of Man and Wales. Often, people were turned away from the theatre as all space, including standing room, had been allocated. In some cases, theatre proprietors were able to ('obliged to' in their parlance) raise ticket prices for her week-run in their theatre. As at the time ticket prices were set regardless of the performers arriving that week, Tilley's ability to sell out even <b>when</b> <b>prices</b> were raised indicates her immense popularity.|$|E
25|$|The {{mortgage}} bonds were {{a way for}} {{the bank}} to raise funds. The bonds, nominal value 100 rubles, were sold to the public by the borrower or the bank. The bank guaranteed redemption of the bonds with its capital and the mortgaged property. A market developed for these bonds. Initially, the market price fluctuated between 81 and 93.25 rubles. Due to the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), the price dropped to 78 rubles. <b>When</b> <b>prices</b> rebounded and stabilized at 92–96 rubles, Russian government ordered to lower the interest rate to 5% in 1886. In 1895, the bonds traded at 99–102 rubles and the government lowered the interest to 4.5%. In 1900, among Russian land banks, only Moscow Land Bank had more outstanding mortgage bonds. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, the bond price dropped to 68 rubles. After the revolution, the market recovered and in early 1913 Vilnius Land Bank had 146.5 million rubles worth of mortgage bonds outstanding. In 1913 they traded at an average of 86 rubles.|$|E

25|$|There {{were three}} {{economic}} downturns {{in the early}} 19th century. The first {{was the result of}} the Embargo Act of 1807, which shut off most international shipping and trade due to the Napoleonic Wars. The other two downturns were depressions accompanied by significant periods of deflation during the early 19th century. The first and most severe was during the depression from 1818 to 1821 <b>when</b> <b>prices</b> of agricultural commodities declined by almost 50 percent. A credit contraction caused by a financial crisis in England drained specie out of the U.S. The Bank of the United States also contracted its lending. The price of agricultural commodities fell by almost 50 percent from the high in 1815 to the low in 1821, and did not recover until the late 1830s, although to a significantly lower price level. Most damaging was the price of cotton, the U.S.'s main export. Food crop prices, which had been high because of the famine of 1816 that was caused by the year without a summer, fell after the return of normal harvests in 1818. Improved transportation, mainly from turnpikes, and to a minor extent the introduction of steamboats, significantly lowered transportation costs.|$|E
25|$|While K.L. Devaser {{was quite}} outspoken, his {{influence}} was largely among the urban-based Indian elite and he lacked wider grassroots support. For {{the first eight}} years, the MIC leaders were either of North Indian or Malayalee origin, representing a minority among the Malayan Indians. The majority of Indians (90%) in Malaya at that time were Tamils, mainly the labourers in plantations. Indian plantation workers, the main group of wageworkers in Malaya at the time, experienced enforced segregation because of plantation compound housing. The plantation labour system also worked against the integration of Indian workers into society at large and perpetuated racial and occupational differentiation. For one thing, {{they were unable to}} acquire skills that would facilitate their move to betterpaying jobs elsewhere. Migrant plantation workers were therefore marginalized and polarized in Malaya. Their wages in the post World War II era, which were around 50 cents a day, were tied to rubber prices, falling when the rubber price fell, but never rising <b>when</b> <b>prices</b> rose. K.L. Devaser came under heavy criticism from the Tamil media for not addressing the pressing issues facing the community. Some in the party felt that there was a need for a leader with a stronger relationship with the party’s grassroots. In March 1955, reports in the local daily Tamil Murasu urged Tamils to boycott the MIC. Even in 1955, the Indians clamored for a change in MIC’s leadership and a change did take place because the president had the decency to recognize that he has overstayed his welcome and gave way for change.The MIC's main challenge then, was to reconcile the political aspirations of the middle class with the needs of the labour class, who then comprised 84% of the plantation workforce.|$|E

30|$|Unlike the {{existing}} research in two-level trade credit EOQ models, this paper considers partial order cancellation during advance sales {{period in the}} retailer's inventory system. The objective behind this consideration is that the market customers' decisions upon their orders {{play a vital role}} in trade. Since the payment time of the customers has an impact in the interest earned and interest payable by the retailer, the total costs are estimated under the investigation of exact payment time. The solution procedures are obtained for two cases: (a) <b>when</b> <b>price</b> discount rate is fixed and (b) <b>when</b> <b>price</b> discount rate is a decision variable. Using the derived mathematical theorems, the optimal solutions for price discount and replenishment cycle time are found out for both cases <b>when</b> <b>price</b> discount rate is fixed and endogenous. The sensitivity analyses are made for various inventory parameters.|$|R
