Qualifying {{consisted of}} three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. Only the two Mercedes drivers were capable of proceeding into the second part of qualifying (Q2) without having to use the faster, soft tyres. Nico Rosberg was fastest, ahead of Williams' Valtteri Bottas and Lewis Hamilton. As Carlos Sainz was unable to compete following his crash in practice, only four running drivers were eliminated. Those were both Marussia drivers, the Sauber of Marcus Ericsson and Fernando Alonso for McLaren.|$|E

5|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race, two each on Friday and Saturday. The Friday {{morning and afternoon}} sessions each lasted an hour; {{the third and fourth}} sessions, on Saturday morning, lasted 45 minutes each. Conditions <b>were</b> <b>dry</b> and overcast for the Friday {{practice sessions}} and was held on a dirty track which was caused by rainfall in the run up to the event. Michael Schumacher set the first session's fastest time with an early lap of 1 minute and 21.982 seconds, half a second quicker than teammate Barrichello. Häkkinen had the third fastest time, ahead of Ralf Schumacher and Jean Alesi. The two Benetton drivers were sixth and eighth (with Fisichella ahead of Alexander Wurz); the two were separated by Johnny Herbert. Eddie Irvine and Verstappen completed the top ten. In the second practice session, Michael Schumacher was unable to improve his time but remained fastest; Ralf Schumacher had the second fastest time after putting on a new set of tyres {{towards the end of the}} session. Barrichello was third-fastest, ahead of Jarno Trulli, Coulthard and Jenson Button. Häkkinen, Pedro Diniz, Frentzen and Alesi followed in the top ten.|$|E

Du Yu (222–285) a Chinese Jin Dynasty officer, believed that the land of hills would eventually be leveled into valleys and valleys would gradually rise to form hills. The Daoist alchemist Ge Hong (284–364) wrote of the legendary immortal Magu; in a written dialogue by Ge, Ma Gu described how what was once the Eastern Sea (i.e. East China Sea) had transformed into solid land where mulberry trees grew, and would one day be filled with mountains and dry, dusty lands. The later Persian Muslim scholar Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī (973–1048) hypothesized that India was once covered by the Indian Ocean while observing rock formations at the mouths of rivers.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} dropped over 1inch (25mm) {{of precipitation}} {{across much of}} the Dominican Republic; Santo Domingo reported a peak total of 3.9in (98mm). The rainfall led to flooding, primarily east and west of the capital city, while five rivers overflowed their banks. Several roads were inundated, obstructing traffic. The flooding collapsed a sports center and a house, injuring two people inside. Further inland, 160people had to be evacuated when more than 100houses were flooded. Crop damage was also reported. In Pedernales, gusty winds uprooted trees, several of which fell on power lines which caused power outages in the town. The rainfall was welcomed in the country, as conditions <b>were</b> <b>dry</b> in the preceding months. Light flooding also occurred in eastern Jamaica, though damage there, if any, is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race: each lasted for 75 minutes. A test session, scheduled for Friday afternoon, ran for 90 minutes.

De Ferran was fastest {{in the first}} practice session {{with a time of}} 59.107 seconds; his teammate Castroneves was second and Tony Kanaan third. Jimmy Vasser was fourth-fastest, ahead of Tagliani and Christian Fittipaldi. Da Matta, Patrick Carpentier, Franchitti and Paul Tracy rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Four red flags came out: the first came when a fuel cover from Carpentier's car was located on the racing line, The second was for Bruno Junqueira who spun in turn eight and stalled on track, the third for Andretti who made contact with the turn eight tire barrier and damaged his left-front suspension; Bräck went onto the turn's run-off area to avoid hitting Andretti. The final stoppage was for de Ferran who slid into the turn one tire barrier and damaged his front-end.|$|E
5|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race, two each on Friday and Saturday. The Friday {{morning and afternoon}} sessions each lasted an hour; {{the third and fourth}} sessions, on Saturday morning, lasted 45 minutes each.

Coulthard set the first session's fastest time with a lap of 1 minute and 53.398 seconds, eight-tenths of a second quicker than Michael Schumacher. Häkkinen had the third-fastest time, with Jarno Trulli, Barrichello and Jacques Villeneuve in the next three positions. The two Benetton drivers were seventh and eighth (with Wurz ahead of Fisichella), and the Williams cars of Ralf Schumacher and Button completed the top ten. Alesi's Prost had a fuel-pressure problem which prevented him from completing a timed lap, and he was the slowest overall. In the second practice session, due to a slow rear puncture Coulthard's first-session lap was still the fastest; Häkkinen had the second-fastest time. Jaguar driver Johnny Herbert changed his car's balance, improving its performance and finishing third-fastest. Villeneuve moved into fourth after changes to his car's setup; Michael Schumacher slipped to fifth, and Wurz finished sixth. Jos Verstappen was seventh-fastest, ahead of Fisichella, Barrichello and Trulli.|$|E

50|$|Foods <b>are</b> <b>dried</b> {{to inhibit}} {{microbial}} development and quality decay. However, {{the extent of}} drying depends on product end-use. Cereals and oilseeds <b>are</b> <b>dried</b> after harvest to the moisture content that allows microbial stability during storage. Vegetables <b>are</b> blanched before <b>drying</b> to avoid rapid darkening, and <b>drying</b> <b>is</b> not only carried out to inhibit microbial growth, but also to avoid browning during storage. Concerning dried fruits, the reduction of moisture acts in combination with its acid and sugar contents to provide protection against microbial growth. Products such as milk powder must <b>be</b> <b>dried</b> to very low moisture contents {{in order to ensure}} flowability and avoid caking. This moisture is lower than that required to ensure inhibition to microbial development. Other products as crackers <b>are</b> <b>dried</b> beyond the microbial growth threshold to confer a crispy texture, which is liked by consumers.|$|R

Barrichello set the first session's fastest time, at 1 minute and 13.603 seconds, two-tenths of a second quicker than Jarno Trulli. Ricardo Zonta finished with the third fastest time. Verstappen, Michael Schumacher and Coulthard filled in the next three positions. Fisichella, Johnny Herbert, Jacques Villeneuve and Mika Salo rounded out the top ten positions. Häkkinen's car was afflicted with a mechanical fuel pump issue; this restricted him to one out lap and he was slowest overall. In the second practice session, Coulthard set the fastest lap of the day, a 1:12.464; Häkkinen had a trouble free season and ended with the second fastest time. Salo ran quicker during the session and was third fastest. Michael Schumacher and Barrichello had the fourth and seventh fastest times respectively; they were separated by Zonta and Trulli. Villeneuve, Diniz and Fisichella completed the top ten positions. After the second session, Irvine, who had only participated in the first practice session, withdrew from the Grand Prix. He had felt unwell upon arrival at the circuit and was diagnosed with appendicitis at the infield medical centre. He was replaced by Jaguar's test driver Luciano Burti.|$|E
5|$|In 1905 {{passage of}} the Moore {{amendment}} expanded the state's Nicholson local option law to apply to all liquor license applicants within a local township or city ward. The {{next step was to}} seek countywide prohibition. The IASL appealed to the general public, holding large rallies in Indianapolis and elsewhere, to support a county option law that would provide a more restrictive ban on alcohol. In September 1908 Indiana governor J. Frank Hanly, a Methodist, Republican, and teetotaler, called for a special legislative session to establish a county option that would allow county voters to prohibit alcohol sales throughout their county. The state legislature passed the bill with only a narrow margin. By November 1909 seventy of Indiana's ninety-two counties <b>were</b> <b>dry.</b> In 1911 a Democratic legislative majority replaced the county option with the Proctor law, a less-geographically restrictive local option, and the number of dry counties was reduced to twenty-six. Despite the setback prohibition advocates continued to lobby legislators for support. In December 1917 several temperance organizations formed the Indiana Dry Federation to fight the politically powerful liquor interests, with the IASL joining the group a short time later. The Federation and the League vigorously campaigned for statewide prohibition, which the Indiana General Assembly adopted in February 1917. Subsequent legal challenges delayed implementation of statewide prohibition until 1918, when a court ruled in June that Indiana's prohibition law was constitutionally valid.|$|E
5|$|The {{conditions}} for the race <b>were</b> <b>dry,</b> with a capacity crowd of some 40,000 fans turning out to watch the race. The drivers took to the track on Sunday morning for a 30-minute warm-up session. Both Williams cars maintained their good performance from qualifying; Coulthard was fastest with teammate Hill in second. Schumacher completed the top three positions. Herbert and Katayama both suffered from gearbox problems with their race cars, and elected to start the race with their teams' spare cars. The Simtek team did not {{take part in the}} session, as both drivers waited for stronger suspension components flown out from the United Kingdom to be fitted to the cars for the race. Minutes before the race started, a press release from the FIA was given to all media and team personnel, notifying them that the chromatographic analysis of the Elf fuel samples taken from Schumacher's Benetton and the Coulthard's Williams during qualifying did not match the sample provided by the fuel company {{before the start of the}} season for reference purposes, thus rendering both cars illegal. Both teams were fined $30,000 and raced under appeal, as the standard penalty for the offence was disqualification from the event. Neither Schumacher nor Coulthard were informed of the situation, as the teams did not want to unsettle their drivers before the race start. Hill and Herbert's races were not affected by the judgement, despite using the same type of fuel. Samples from Ferrari's Agip and McLaren's Mobil fuel were also tested; both were in accordance with the regulations. Though 26cars qualified for the race, only 25 took the start: Martini retired on the parade lap, his Minardi car suffering a gearbox problem.|$|E

25|$|Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from Central Europe {{began to}} migrate northwards {{from the end}} of the last ice age (between 12,000 and 10,000years before present(BP)). The area that would become known as Wales had become free of glaciers by about 10,250BP. At that time sea levels were much lower than today, and the {{shallower}} parts of what is now the North Sea <b>were</b> <b>dry</b> land. The east coast of present-day England and the coasts of present-day Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands were connected by the former landmass known as Doggerland, forming the British Peninsula on the European mainland. The post-glacial rise in sea level separated Wales and Ireland, forming the Irish Sea. Doggerland was submerged by the North Sea and, by 8000BP, the British Peninsula had become the island of Great Britain. John Davies has theorised that the story of Cantre'r Gwaelod's drowning and tales in the Mabinogion, of the waters between Wales and Ireland being narrower and shallower, may be distant folk memories of this time.|$|E

25|$|By the 1950s, the {{southern}} section was un-navigable by canal boats, as {{several of the}} locks could not be operated, {{and some of the}} small pounds between the locks of the Wilmcote flight <b>were</b> <b>dry.</b> Problems with a bridge also began the process of restoring this section. Warwickshire County Council sought to obtain legal abandonment of the canal in 1958, as they wished to replace bridge 59 at Wilmcote without the expense of providing navigable headroom. A campaign against closure was mounted by the Inland Waterways Association and local activists. Two canoeists, who had used the canal recently, produced a dated toll ticket for their journey, which was offered as proof that the canal was not disused. Retention of the canal was announced on 22 May 1959, and by 16 October, the British Transport Commission and the National Trust reported that they had agreed on the terms of a lease, under which the National Trust would be responsible for the restoration and maintenance of {{the southern}} section. The transfer of responsibility took place on 29 September 1960, and work began in March 1961. Although the Transport Commission made a contribution towards the cost, the National Trust raised most of the £42,000 required to put it back into good order. The project was managed by David Hutchings, who pioneered the use of voluntary labour, which would be used on many subsequent restorations, and assistance was also given by prisoners from Winson Green prison, the Army and the RAF Airfield Construction Branch. The canal was fully navigable by mid-1964, and Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother officially re-opened it on 11 July. Its restoration was a turning point for the waterways movement in Britain.|$|E
25|$|Cedar Creek Lake is {{a fourth}} water source for Tarrant Regional Water District's water supply. Its normal system {{capacity}} is 322.00ft(98.15m) above sea level. When the lake gets over that point, gates from the spillway are opened, releasing water; 2005 and 2006 <b>were</b> <b>dry</b> years, sending {{the lake to}} a record low on December 12, 2006. The lake fell to 8.04ft(2.45m) below normal, at 313.96ft(95.7m). This passed the old record of 6.22ft(2m) low set on May 8, 1981. That afternoon, the lake received over 4in(102mm) of rain, causing the lake to rise about 6in(152mm). This was the first significant rainfall since April 2006. It was the big turning point for the drought in North Texas, as more rain continued through the month. By January 1, the lake was only a little over 6 feet (2 m) low. Huge rainstorms throughout January brought the lake to only 2 feet (0.6 m) low. A bit of a break came in February, as mainly snow and ice added to the lake rising. By March 31, 2007, the lake was at 322.12ft(98.18m) and the flood gates were open {{for the first time}} since April 20, 2005. Lake Benbrook, Lake Worth, and Lake Arlington also filled up in these rains.

It was a milestone for Tarrant regional water district having all seven of their lakes full. On the night of July 5, more than 5in(127mm) of rain fell, sending Cedar Creek lake from a half foot (15cm) over to 1.5 feet (45cm) over, beating the old 1.47ft(0m) set in November 2001.|$|E
25|$|The first {{reported}} cases of knocked-out teeth being replanted was by Pare’ in 1593. In 1706, Pierre Fauchard also reported replanting knocked out teeth. Wigoper in 1933 used a cast gold splint to hold reimplanted teeth in place. In 1959, Lenstrup and Skieller declared that the success rate of replanted knocked out teeth {{should be considered a}} temporary procedure because the success rate of less than 10% was so poor. In 1966 in a retrospective study, Andresen theorized that 90% of avulsed teeth could be successfully retained if they were replanted within the first 30 minutes of the accident. In 1974, Cvek showed that removal of the dental pulp following reimplantation was necessary to prevent resorption of the tooth root. In 1974, Cvek showed that storage of knocked out teeth in saline could improve the success of replanted teeth. In 1977, Lindskog et al. showed that the key to retention of the knocked-out teeth was to maintain the vitality of the periodontal ligament. In 1980, Blomlof showed the storing the periodontal ligament cells in a biocompatible medium could extend the extra oral time to four hours or more. He found that the best storage medium was a medical research fluid called Hank’s Balanced Solution. In this study, it was serendipitously discovered that milk could also maintain cell viability for two hours. In 1981, Andreasen showed that crushing of cells on the tooth root could cause death of the cells and lead to resorption and reduction in prognosis. In 1983, Matsson et al. showed that soaking in Hank’s Balanced Solution for thirty minutes prior to reimplantation could revitalize extracted dog’s teeth that <b>were</b> <b>dry</b> for 60 minutes. In 1989, a systematic storage device was developed to optimally store and preserve knocked out teeth. In 1992, Trope et al. showed that extracted dog’s teeth could be stored in Hank’s Balanced Solution for up to 96 hours and still maintain significant vitality. In this study, milk was only able to maintain vitality for two hours.|$|E
