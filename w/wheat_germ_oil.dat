40|$|The {{increasing}} {{concern for}} consumed fat by western populations {{has raised the}} question of the level and the quality of fat intake, especially the composition of fatty acids (FA) and their impact on human health. As a consequence, consumers and nutritionists have requested updated publications on FA composition of food containing fat. In the present study, fourteen different kinds of edible oils (rapeseed, olive, hazelnut, argan, groundnut, grape seed, sesame, sunflower, walnut and organic walnut, avocado, <b>wheat</b> <b>germ,</b> and two combined oils) were analysed for FA determination using a BPX- 70 60 m highly polar GC column. Oils were classified according to the classification of Dubois et al. (2007, 2008). Monounsaturated FA (MUFA) group oils, including rapeseed, olive, hazelnut, and avocado oils, contained mainly oleic acid (OA). Groundnut and argan oils, also rich in MUFA, showed in addition high linoleic acid (LA) contents. In the polyunsaturated (PUFA) group, grape seed oil presented the highest LA content while sunflower, sesame, and <b>wheat</b> <b>germ</b> <b>oils</b> showed noticeable MUFA amounts in addition to high PUFA contents. Walnut oils, also rich in LA, showed the highest linolenic acid (ALA) content. The n- 6 /n- 3 ratio of each oil was calculated. Trans-FA (TFA) was also detected and quantified. Results were compared with the data published during the past decade, and the slight discrepancies were attributed to differences in origin and variety of seed-cultivars, and in seed and oil processes...|$|R

It is limited in soybean, but potentially abundant in <b>wheat</b> <b>germ.</b> Research on the utilization of <b>wheat</b> <b>germ</b> sterol had not been reported so far. Many aspects of germ sterol extraction from <b>wheat</b> <b>germ</b> and its characteristics were still unknown. In this research, the best extraction method, kinds and content of phytosterol from <b>wheat</b> <b>germ</b> were investigated. This research consisted of two steps: (1) extraction of phytosterol directly form whole germ and ground germ using hexane, and indirect extraction through <b>germ</b> <b>oil</b> using hexane and mixed solvent of hexane and ethanol, and direct extraction from ground germ using ethanol; (2) analysis of the type and content of phytosterol in the crude extract through the following steps: preparation of crude extract, fractionation, and analysis. Results showed that indirect extraction through <b>germ</b> <b>oil</b> was considered as the best method which yielded 1. 37 % of phytosterol. The highest yield was obtained when extracted using a mixed solvent of hexane Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ethanol 82 : 18. However, the odor of ethanol and hexane (gasoline like odor) was still detected. The solventÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ratio of hexane to ethanol at 1 : 2 resulted better odor of the extract.

50|$|The germ of a cereal is the {{reproductive}} part that germinates {{to grow into}} a plant; it is the embryo of the seed. Along with bran, germ is often a by-product of the milling that produces refined grain products. Cereal grains and their components, such as <b>wheat</b> <b>germ</b> <b>oil,</b> rice bran oil, and maize, {{may be used as}} a source from which vegetable oil is extracted, or used directly as a food ingredient. The germ is retained {{as an integral part of}} whole-grain foods. Non-whole grain methods of milling are intended to isolate the endosperm, which is ground into flour, with removal of both the husk (bran) and the germ. Removal of bran is aimed at producing a flour with a white rather than a brown color, and eliminating fiber, which reduces nutrition. The germ is rich in polyunsaturated fats (which have a tendency to oxidize and become rancid on storage) and so germ removal improves the storage qualities of flour.|$|E

50|$|Vitamin E {{refers to}} a group of {{compounds}} that include both tocopherols and tocotrienols. Of the many different forms of vitamin E, γ-tocopherol is the most common form found in the North American diet. γ-Tocopherol can be found in corn oil, soybean oil, margarine, and dressings. α-tocopherol, the most biologically active form of vitamin E, is the second-most common form of vitamin E in the diet. This variant can be found most abundantly in <b>wheat</b> <b>germ</b> <b>oil,</b> sunflower, and safflower oils. As a fat-soluble antioxidant, it interrupts the propagation of reactive oxygen species that spread through biological membranes or through a fat when its lipid content undergoes oxidation by reacting with more-reactive lipid radicals to form more stable products. Regular consumption of more than 1,000 mg (1,500 IU) of tocopherols per day may be expected to cause hypervitaminosis E, with an associated risk of vitamin K deficiency and consequently of bleeding problems.|$|E
5000|$|Omega-3 {{fatty acids}} [...] Omega-3 fatty acids are {{a family of}} {{polyunsaturated}} fatty acids. This {{is one of the}} two Essential fatty acids, so called because humans cannot manufacture it and must get it from food. Omega-3 fatty acids are mostly obtained from oily fish caught in high-latitude waters. They are comparatively uncommon in vegetable sources, including margarine. However, one type of Omega-3 fatty acid, alpha-Linolenic acid (ALA) can be found in some vegetable oils. Flax oil contains 30-50% of ALA, and is becoming a popular dietary supplement to rival fish oils; both are often added to premium margarines. An ancient oil plant, camelina sativa, has recently gained popularity because of its high Omega-3 content (30-45%), and it has been added to some margarines. Hemp oil contains about 20% ALA. Small amounts of ALA are found in vegetable oils such as soybean oil (7%), rapeseed oil (7%) and <b>wheat</b> <b>germ</b> <b>oil</b> (5%).|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the preventing effect of <b>wheat</b> <b>germ</b> <b>oil</b> as a rich source of vitamin E on the serum biochemical factors in the rats exposed to para-nonylphenol. Four groups (n = 6) of male Wistar rats was orally given para-nonylphenol (200 mg kgG - 1 dayG - 1) for 70 days. After treatment the blood samples were obtained and LH, FSH, testosterone, progesterone and estrogen, transaminases, phosphatases, LDH, triglyceride, cholesterol, HDL-cholestrol and protein analysis were carried out. Para-nonylphenol caused a significant increase in LH level where other hormones remained unchanged. In addition a significant reduction was found in AST, ALT and LDH level while alkaline phosphatase increased significantly following treatment with para-nonylphenol. There was no change in the level of lipids and proteins in this study with respect to para-nonylphenol treatment. Co-administration of <b>wheat</b> <b>germ</b> <b>oil</b> with para-nonylphenol compensated the imbalance of the LH, AST, ALT and LDH caused by para-nonylphenol to the control level. However treatment of the rats with only <b>wheat</b> <b>germ</b> <b>oil</b> caused a significant reduction in the level of the hormones except for progesterone.

The recommendations to consume more oily {{fish and the}} use of UVB treated yeast are already applied strategies to address vitamin D insufficiency. This study aimed to elucidate the suitability of plant oils as an alternative vitamin D source. Therefore, plant oils that are commonly used in human nutrition were firstly analyzed for their content of vitamin D precursors and metabolites. Secondly, selected oils were exposed to a short-term UVB irradiation to stimulate the synthesis of vitamin D. Finally, to elucidate the efficacy of plant-derived vitamin D to improve the vitamin D status, we fed UVB-exposed <b>wheat</b> <b>germ</b> <b>oil</b> for 4 weeks to mice and compared them with mice that received non-exposed or vitamin D 3 supplemented <b>wheat</b> <b>germ</b> <b>oil.</b> Sterol analysis revealed that the selected plant oils contained high amounts of ergosterol, but also 7 -dehydrocholesterol (7 -DHC), with the highest concentrations found in <b>wheat</b> <b>germ</b> <b>oil.</b> Exposure to UVB irradiation resulted in a partial conversion of ergosterol and 7 -DHC to vitamin D 2 and D 3 in these oils. Mice fed the UVB-exposed <b>wheat</b> <b>germ</b> <b>oil</b> were able to improve their vitamin D status as shown by the rise in the plasma concentration of 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) and the liver content of vitamin D compared to mice fed the non-exposed oil.

CWG and UWG induced high levels of anti-inflammatory IL- 10 and heme oxygenase- 1. CWG specifically inhibited phosphorylation of NF-κB p 65 and p 38 kinase at 15 min after LPS stimulation. Our study showed that citric acid treatment enhanced the anti-inflammatory activity of <b>wheat</b> <b>germ</b> extract...|$|R

Considering dysmenorrhea adverse consequences and Considering the anti-inflammatory properties of <b>wheat</b> <b>germ,</b> this study aimed to determine the effects of <b>wheat</b> <b>germ</b> extract on the systemic symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea and menstrual bleeding. Methods: triple blind clinical trial study was conducted from June 1 to September 29, 2013 on 90 women working in hospitals affiliated to Hamadan University of Medical Sciences. The participants were matched before intervention for age, body mass index, income, menarche age, marital status and severity of systemic symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea, Then they using randomized table of numbers were randomly divided into two groups of 45 people. In <b>wheat</b> <b>germ</b> group, 400 mg capsules of <b>wheat</b> <b>germ</b> extract were used three times a day, from day 16 until the fifth day of the menstrual cycle. The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics such as the Friedman test and Man Whitney test. Results: In the <b>wheat</b> <b>germ</b> extract group there was a statistically significant difference in systemic symptoms associated with primary dysmenorrhea fatigue, headache and mood swings (P< 0. 001). Conclusion: The results showed that <b>wheat</b> <b>germ</b> extract reduces the severity systemic symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea but is not effect on the menstrual bleeding and can be used to reduce the severity of systemic symptoms. ...|$|R
