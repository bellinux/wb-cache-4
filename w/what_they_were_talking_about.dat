5|$|A Naval Board of Inquiry was convened on July 21, 1944, to {{find out}} what had happened. The {{official}} proceeding lasted for 39 days and included interviews with witnesses who were officers, civilians and enlisted men. Ordnance experts were questioned as well as inspectors who had overseen previous loading procedures. Five African Americans were questioned, none of whom were later to refuse to load ammunition. Captain Kinne's posted division tonnage results came to light in the inquiry but Kinne stated that the competition to load the most tonnage did not make for unsafe conditions; he implied that any junior officers who said so did not know <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxóchitl, a mestizo {{historian}} and descendant of Coanacoch, wrote {{an account of}} the executions in the 17th century partly based on Texcocan oral tradition. According to Ixtlilxóchitl, the three lords were joking cheerfully with one another because of a rumor that Cortés had decided to return the expedition to Mexico, when Cortés asked a spy to tell him <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> The spy reported honestly, but Cortés invented the plot himself. Cuauhtémoc, Coanacoch, and Tetlepanquetzal were hanged as well as eight others. However, Cortés cut down Coanacoch, the last to be hanged, after his brother began rallying his warriors. Coanacoch did not have long to enjoy his reprieve, as Ixtlilxóchitl wrote that he died a few days later.|$|E
500|$|Until now, Cardinale's {{own voice}} {{had not been}} used in her Italian films, as it was {{considered}} too hoarse, and owing to [...] her French accent, insufficiently Italian. Not until 8½ was she allowed to use her own voice. Cardinale explained: [...] "When I arrived for my first movie, I couldn't speak a word. I thought I was on the moon. I couldn't understand <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> And I was speaking in French; in fact I was dubbed. And Federico Fellini {{was the first one}} who used my voice. I think I had a very strange voice." [...] With her portrayal of Angelica in The Leopard and her brief appearance as herself in 8½, Cardinale achieved the definitive status of a top-ranking star.|$|E

500|$|Dixon {{has often}} cited Madonna as an influence, saying [...] "Madonna {{is a big}} idol. I loved her when I {{was a young girl}} and I feel like I've been on a musical journey with her". Dixon's single [...] "Let's Get Excited" [...] namechecked the singer and her 1985 single [...] "Into the Groove". Furthermore, the music video {{featured}} what Dixon described as [...] "a Madonna tribute" [...] featuring voguing throughout. Additionally, Dixon has described Kylie Minogue as her childhood idol. Growing up, the first record Dixon ever bought was [...] "Push It" [...] by the hip hop group Salt-n-Pepa; she remarked [...] "I didn't understand <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> at the time... They were raw and did their own thing, and I loved that. I love artists who don't conform to what people expect of them".|$|E
500|$|To Freeman Dyson, {{one thing}} at least was clear: Sin'ichirō Tomonaga, Schwinger and Feynman {{understood}} <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> even {{if no one else}} did, but had not published anything. Moreover, he was convinced that Feynman's formulation was easier to understand, and ultimately managed to convince Oppenheimer that this was the case. Dyson published a paper in 1949, which added new rules to Feynman's that told how to implement renormalization. Feynman was prompted to publish his ideas in the Physical Review in a series of papers over three years. His 1948 papers on [...] "A Relativistic Cut-Off for Classical Electrodynamics" [...] attempted to explain what he had been unable to get across at Pocono. His 1949 paper on [...] "The Theory of Positrons" [...] addressed the Schrödinger equation and Dirac equation, and introduced what is now called the Feynman propagator. Finally, in papers on the [...] "Mathematical Formulation of the Quantum Theory of Electromagnetic Interaction" [...] in 1950 and [...] "An Operator Calculus Having Applications in Quantum Electrodynamics" [...] in 1951, he developed the mathematical basis of his ideas, derived familiar formulae and advanced new ones.|$|E
2500|$|In {{speaking}} about the show in 2010, Bain reflected: [...] "We had some very good science fiction people as advisors who knew <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> For instance, they knew that sound up there wouldn't travel, and {{it would just be}} quiet up there. But then we wouldn't have a series, so we couldn't do that. There were various considerations that had to be made, but they were based on what is, or what was, known at the time. For all I know now it's out of date. I don't really know." ...|$|E

2500|$|Among {{the things}} that endeared him to his public was his comic use of {{language}} in his films; his characters (all of which were really variations of the main [...] "Cantinflas" [...] persona but cast in different social roles and circumstances) would strike up a normal conversation and then complicate it {{to the point where}} no one understood <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b> The Cantinflas character was particularly adept at obfuscating the conversation when he owed somebody money, was courting an attractive young woman, or was trying to talk his way out of trouble with authorities, whom he managed to humiliate without their even being able to tell. This manner of talking became known as Cantinflear, and it became common parlance for Spanish speakers to say [...] "¡estás cantinfleando!" [...] (loosely translated as you're pulling a [...] "Cantinflas!" [...] or you're [...] "Cantinflassing!") whenever someone became hard to understand in conversation. The Real Academia Española officially included the verb, cantinflear, cantinflas and cantinflada in its dictionary in 1992.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Monsalvat School for the Comparative Study of Religion", a {{progressive}} or liberal development seen against conservative religious experience, was established formally in 1896 {{as an institution}} hosted at Greenacre and the first director was Lewis Janes. Monsalvat was named after the sacred mountain in Wagner’s Parsifal where the Holy Grail was kept, though it is most often spelled Montsalvat. However, Farmer and Janes differed often - Janes wanted academic credentials among his speakers and a business-like plan for the economic solvency of the work by charging everyone rather than trusting on contributions. They had serious difficulty even agreeing on <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> - [...] "This difference of understanding could never have occurred between two men accustomed to business methods," [...] Janes wrote in 1899. Farmer framed the school as a place for encounter between religious leaders for [...] "a fuller realization" [...] of unity among religions, and relied on generosity and enthusiasm to overcome the challenges of economy. Nevertheless, the school and Greenacre continue to operate and was noted in newspapers.|$|E
2500|$|King Hrothgar {{is portrayed}} by Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins noted in an {{interview}} that since Zemeckis is an American, he wasn't certain what accent Hopkins should use for the role of Hrothgar. Hopkins told him, [...] "Well, Welsh would be my closest because that's where I come from." [...] It was also his first time working with motion capture technology. Hopkins noted, [...] "I didn't know what was expected. It was explained to me, I'm not stupid, but I still don't get the idea of how it works. I have no idea [...] you don't have sets, so it is like being in a Brecht play, you know, with just bare bones and you have nothing else." [...] When asked if he had to read the original poem of Beowulf in school, Hopkins replied: [...] "No, I was hopeless at school. I couldn't read anything. I mean I could read, but I was so inattentive. I was one of those poor kids, you know, who was just very slow, didn't know <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about...</b> So I tried to get around to reading Beowulf just before I did this movie, and it was a good modern translation. It was Trevor Griffiths, I’m not sure, but I couldn't hack it, and I tend to like to just go with the script if it's a good script." ...|$|E
5000|$|The English academic, {{lexicographer}} {{and radio}} personality Terence Dolan {{has suggested that}} rhyming slang may have been invented by Irish immigrants to London [...] "so the actual English wouldn't understand <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>talking</b> about." ...|$|R
