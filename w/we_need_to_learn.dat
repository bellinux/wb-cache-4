2500|$|The show {{started with}} Knowles almost entirely {{obscured}} by smoke, walking {{towards the front}} of the stage and striking a pose in silhouette with only one beam of light illuminating her as she sang several lines of [...] "Déjà Vu". The lights went up and Knowles was revealed wearing spangly gold leotard and stilettos joined by two dancers in PVC catsuits and an all-female band who started playing the opening horns of [...] "Crazy in Love". More PVC-clad dancers emerged, while canons {{on either side of the}} stage puffed clouds of glitter out over the crowd and confetti were also dropped on stage as Knowles sang the song. She continued to perform [...] "Naughty Girl" [...] while banks of bright orange lights were displayed on stage. During [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] Knowles bent backwards at her guitarist's feet. She asked the crowd [...] "Are ya'll ready to dance?" [...] and went on singing [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] wearing a sequin dress while performing dance routines. Knowles later emerged atop a giant lighted flight of stairs wearing a white leotard and sang [...] "Smash Into You" [...] – the staircase was the show's biggest piece of equipment. She performed [...] "Ave Maria" [...] in a white dress which was later turned into a bridal dress after a veil was put on her head by the backing dancers. She sang the song with an operatic soprano voice adding an excerpt from Sarah McLachlan's [...] "Angel" [...] and Franz Schubert's Ave Maria". She continued on to sing [...] "Broken-Hearted Girl" [...] wearing a white bustier with a sheer, flowing wrap. At the conclusion of the song, outtakes from the music video of [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] were shown before she appeared to perform the aforementioned song wearing Ray-Bans, a leather breastplate, aviator shades and a bulletproof-looking one-piece further asking the crowd to sing along the track. She included an excerpt from Alanis Morissette's [...] "You Oughta Know" [...] and Tupac Shakur's [...] "California Love" [...] while also doing several moves like a male. A video interlude directed by Melina Matsoukas was shown as excerpts from [...] "Sweet Dreams" [...] was played in the background. The video showed Knowles as a robot further interacting with a cheetah as a mechanical voice intoned Sasha Fierce. This was a short introduction before Knowles performed the electro song [...] "Diva" [...] dressed in a leopard print leotard. She appeared at the top of the staircase with her backup dancers behind her while another video interlude showing Knowles singing and dancing at the age of five was shown. She then sang [...] "Radio" [...] while a clip was projected on the screen showing her dancing as a child. [...] "Me, Myself and I" [...] was introduced with a brief speech about female empowerment with Knowles saying [...] "Ladies, we need each other. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> from each other, and we need to empower each other". [...] "Ego" [...] and [...] "Hello" [...] were also performed afterwards.|$|E

40|$|Learning of {{mathematics}} starts from when we begin <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how <b>to</b> count. Then we use mathematics in our everyday lives, sometimes without even realizing. In these situations, what <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> - the ‘basic numerical concepts’ - {{was nothing but}} a way of expressing ourselves (in a language), in order to communicate with and relate to others. Mathematical skills develop as we grow and get involved in more and more activities, for example: measuring flour while making cakes or maybe rushing to ‘the sale’ calculating (in our heads) how much money could be saved. What <b>we</b> <b>need</b> in these occasions is mostly common sense, a practical approach towards obtaining a solution and some prior experience. Everyday mathematics does not require the brains of an academic mathematician. Sometimes it is surprising how people even with barely any formal education can deal with calculations so quickly.
