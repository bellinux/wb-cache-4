500|$|It forms {{part of the}} City and County of Cardiff and is now {{managed by}} Cardiff Council's Flat Holm Project Team and {{designated}} as a Local Nature Reserve, Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Protection Area, because of the maritime grassland and rare plants such as rock sea-lavender (Limonium binervosum) and <b>wild</b> <b>leek</b> (Allium ampeloprasum). The island also has significant breeding colonies of lesser black-backed gulls (Larus fuscus), [...] herring gulls (Larus argentatus) and great black-backed gulls (Larus marinus). It {{is also home to}} slowworms (Anguis fragilis) with larger than usual blue markings.|$|E
500|$|There are no endemic {{plant species}} but the {{relative}} {{isolation of the}} island has allowed a number of hardy species such as bird's-foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus) and biting stonecrop (Sedum acre) to thrive. There are also a number of relatively rare plants, such as rock sea-lavender (Limonium binervosum), and <b>wild</b> <b>leek</b> (Allium ampeloprasum). The leek grows to [...] and Flat Holm {{is one of only}} five places in the UK where it is found. Related to the onion, the leek has a bulb that grows for several years producing only leaves, then blooms with large purple flowers that smell of garlic. After flowering the bulb dies and produces up to 150 bulblets.|$|E
2500|$|Allium tricoccum (commonly {{known as}} ramp, ramps, spring onion, ramson, <b>wild</b> <b>leek,</b> wood leek, and wild garlic) is a North American species of wild onion {{widespread}} across eastern Canada {{and the eastern}} [...] United States.

50|$|Allium ampeloprasum is {{a member}} of the onion genus Allium.

Also, some wild plants with edible rhizomes (underground, horizontal stems) can be found, such as cattail, ground nut, Solomon's seal and false Solomon's seal. Wild edible tubers include arrowhead, and many more. Wild edible stems, like their domestic relatives, are usually only good when young and growing. Many of these also require preparation (as do many domestic plants, such as the potato), so {{it is wise to}} read up on the plant before experimenting with eating it.|$|R

50|$|The Tatar cuisine {{relies heavily}} on the main {{agricultural}} products of the region - cereals and livestock. Fruits and vegetables were much less developed in the region's agriculture, although {{the relative importance of}} the potato began to increase {{from the end of the}} 19th century. Local vegetables included onions, carrot, horseradish, turnips, pumpkins, beets and, in small quantities, also cucumbers and cabbage. Fruits were mainly grown in orchards on the right bank of Volga, including local apple, cherries, raspberries, and currants. The forests were a source for wild berries, walnuts, hops, cow parsnip, sorrel, mint, and common <b>wild</b> <b>leeks.</b> Mushrooms were not typical in traditional Tatar cooking, and they began to be used only recently, especially among the urban population. Cattle and sheep provided beef and mutton, both equally popular among the Tatars. Horse meat was eaten boiled, salted, and cured. Milk was used primarily in dairy products, such as curds, sour cream, etc. Poultry was widespread in local farms (chickens, geese), and eggs were a popular dish, eaten in various forms. Beekeeping in the forest-steppe belt produced an abundance of honey for local consumption.|$|R

60|$|Our guide had {{remained}} at Lamteng, on the plea of a sore {{on his leg}} from leech-bites: his real object, however, was to stop a party {{on their way to}} Tibet with madder and canes, who, had they continued their journey, would inevitably have pointed out the road to me. The villagers themselves now wanted to proceed to the pasturing-grounds on the frontier; so the Phipun sent me word that I might proceed as far as I liked up the east bank of the Zemu. I had explored the path, and finding it practicable, and likely to intersect a less frequented route to the frontier (that crossing the Tekonglah pass from Bah, see chapter XVIII), I determined to follow it. A supply of food arrived from Dorjiling on the 5th of June, reduced, however, to one bag of rice, but with encouraging letters, and the assurance that more would follow at once. My men, of whom I bad eight, behaved admirably, although our diet had for five days chiefly consisted of Polygonum ("Pullop-bi"), <b>wild</b> <b>leeks</b> ("Lagook"), nettles and Procris (an allied, and more succulent herb), eked out by eight pounds of Tibet meal ("Tsamba"), which I had bought for ten shillings by stealth from the villagers. What concerned me most was the destruction of my plants by constant damp, and the want of sun to dry the papers; which reduced my collections to a tithe of what they would otherwise have been.|$|R
25|$|The Nivkh had {{a diverse}} diet being semi-sedentary before colonization. Fish {{was the main}} source of food for the Nivkh, {{including}} pink, Pacific, and chum salmon as well as trout, Red Eye, burbot and pike found in rivers and streams. Salt water fishing provided saffron cod, flatfish, and marine goby caught in the littoral coasts of the Strait of Tartary, Sea of Okhotsk, and the Pacific Ocean, though over fishing by Russian and Japanese trawlers have depleted many of these fish stocks. Additionally, industrial pollution such as phenols and heavy metals in the Amur River have devastated fish stocks and damaged the soil of the estuaries. A traditional preservation process called Yukola, involving slicing the fish in a particular way and drying the strips by hanging them in the frigid air, without salt, was used before foreign influences. The preservation process created a lot of dried fish waste, unpalatable for human consumption but utilized for dog food. Pulverizing dried fish and mixing it with fish skins, water, seal fat, and berries until the mixture had a sour cream consistency is a favorite Nivkh dish called mos. Nivkhs would hunt seal (Larha, Reinged, Reibbon, Sea-lions), duck, sable, and otters. They would gather various berries, <b>wild</b> <b>leeks,</b> lilybulbs, and nuts. Contacts with the Chinese, Manchu, and Japanese from the 12th century on introduced new foods incorporated in the Nivkhs diet such as salt, sugar, rice, millet, legumes and tea. Russian 19th century colonisation introduced flour, bread, potatoes, vodka, tobacco, butter, canned vegetables and fruits, and other meats.|$|R
50|$|Vegetables {{included}} onions, chives, cabbage, celery, <b>wild</b> {{garlic and}} <b>leeks.</b> Fathen (Chenopodium album) {{a form of}} wild lentil, is often found on pre Norman archaeological sites and {{appears to have been}} {{an important part of the}} diet, as it still is in Northern India. Skirret (Sium sisaram) in Irish cearrachÃ¡n, appears to have been grown as a root vegetable, this is no longer used. Watercress, sorrel, parsley and nettles were picked wild and eaten raw or added to broth.|$|R
