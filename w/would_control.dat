5|$|On 18 August 1941, {{while he}} was {{concluding}} arrangements with the Germans, Pećanac {{received a letter from}} rival Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović proposing an arrangement where Pećanac <b>would</b> <b>control</b> the Chetniks south of the Western Morava River while Mihailović <b>would</b> <b>control</b> the Chetniks in all other areas. Pećanac declined this request and suggested that he might offer Mihailović the position as his chief of staff. He also recommended that Mihailović's detachments disband and join his organisation. In the meantime, Pećanac had arranged for the transfer of several thousand of his Chetniks to the Serbian Gendarmerie to act as German auxiliaries.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge {{dodged the}} issue during the campaign, which he won in 1825, {{but once he}} took office, {{he had to come}} down on one side or the other. He voted in favor of the Old Court, {{reflecting}} his upper-class status and affinity for the establishment. In so doing, he identified himself with the party of Kentucky's favorite son, Henry Clay. The Whigs <b>would</b> <b>control</b> Kentucky politics for the next twenty-five years. In 1826, the majority of the General Assembly sided with the Old Court and abolished the New Court.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by Villa's and Orozco's actions, {{as well as}} the {{outbreak}} of the Zapatista rebellion in Morelos, Madero crossed back into Mexico in February 1911. After a few minor engagements with units of Diaz's army, Madero, Orozco and Villa decided to attack the federal garrison at Ciudad Juárez. If they could take the city, they <b>would</b> <b>control</b> traffic between Mexico and the US. Furthermore, such a major success by the revolutionaries could very well be the final push that would knock over the Porfiriato.|$|E

5|$|On 22 June, the Second Armistice at Compiègne {{was signed}} between France and Germany ending hostilities. Northern and western France was placed under direct German occupation, while Alsace-Lorraine {{became part of}} Germany. Italy <b>would</b> <b>control</b> its own zone in the southeast, and an unoccupied zone, the zone libre, would be governed by the newly formed Vichy {{government}} (État Français) led by Pétain. Vichy was nominally independent, and still controlled French overseas colonies, but in practice was essentially a German client state.|$|E
5|$|On March 5, 1735, George Mason III {{died when}} his boat capsized while {{crossing}} the Potomac. His widow Ann would raise their son George (then 9) and two younger siblings as co-guardian with lawyer John Mercer.

5|$|The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) {{determined}} how the United States <b>would</b> <b>control</b> {{and manage}} the nuclear technology it had jointly developed with its World War II allies, the United Kingdom and Canada. Most significantly, the Act ruled that nuclear weapon development and nuclear power management would be under civilian, rather than military control, and established the United States Atomic Energy Commission for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine force went on {{to invade}} Arzanene. Philippicus besieged Chlomaron, the chief city of the area. At this point, Jovius and Maruthas, two local leaders, {{defected}} to the Byzantines. They promised to help locate the ideal positions for building impregnable forts that <b>would</b> <b>control</b> the passage through the Taurus Mountains and Hakkâri, allowing the Byzantines to control the routes that connected Arzanene with Persarmenia and Lower Mesopotamia. Philippicus assigned Heraclius the Elder, noted at this point as his second-in-command (hypostrategos), to follow the guides to the strong points indicated.|$|E
5|$|The Ravens were {{volunteer}} Air Force {{officers who}} already had 500 flying hours (six months) as FACs in South Vietnam and who would serve six-month tours in Laos. There were {{always going to be}} shortages of both personnel and aircraft in the new program. Only six Ravens were assigned between 1966 and 1968 to control the ever-expanding amounts of U.S. airpower being utilized in Laos. Even {{at the height of the}} program, when they <b>would</b> <b>control</b> one-third to two-thirds of the tactical air strikes in the Barrel Roll area, there were never more than 22 Ravens.|$|E

5|$|Van der Aue {{worked on}} {{procedures}} for surface decompression and oxygen {{use in the}} early 1950s and during his research found problems with the 1937 tables for long dive times. He {{also found that the}} fast tissues which had been dropped in the 1930s <b>would</b> <b>control</b> decompression in some cases, so he re-introduced the fast compartments to the model, and added an extra slower compartment to better model long-duration dives.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Rademacher foresaw {{roles for}} other {{government}} agencies. Ribbentrop's Foreign Affairs Ministry would negotiate {{terms with the}} French for the handover of Madagascar to Germany. It would also {{play a part in}} crafting other treaties to deal with Europe's Jews. Its Information Department, along with Joseph Goebbels and his Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, <b>would</b> <b>control</b> the flow of information at home and abroad. Viktor Brack, a division chief in the Chancellery of the Führer, would oversee transportation. The SS would undertake the expulsion of the Jews from Europe and govern the island as a police state. The Nazis expected that after the invasion of the United Kingdom in Operation Sea Lion that they would commandeer the British merchant fleet to transport the Jews to Madagascar. Many deportees were expected to perish in the harsh conditions or die {{at the hands of the}} SS.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed {{by these}} Athenian successes, the Persians stopped backing the allies and began {{supporting}} Sparta. This defection forced the allies to seek peace. The King's Peace, {{also known as}} the Peace of Antalcidas, was signed in 387 BC, ending the war. This treaty declared that Persia <b>would</b> <b>control</b> all of Ionia, and that all other Greek cities would be independent. Sparta was to be the guardian of the peace, with the power to enforce its clauses. The effects of the war, therefore, were to establish Persia's ability to interfere successfully in Greek politics and to affirm Sparta's hegemonic position in the Greek political system.|$|E

5|$|Although {{they were}} {{formerly}} enemies, the Tang accepted officials and generals of Goguryeo into their administration and military, {{such as the}} brothers Yeon Namsaeng (634–679) and Yeon Namsan (639–701). From 668 to 676, the Tang Empire <b>would</b> <b>control</b> northern Korea. However, in 671 Silla began fighting the Tang forces there. At {{the same time the}} Tang faced threats on its western border when a large Chinese army was defeated by the Tibetans on the Dafei River in 670. By 676, the Tang army was driven out of Korea by Unified Silla. Following a revolt of the Eastern Turks in 679, the Tang abandoned its Korean campaigns.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of December, Virginia Tech's offensive preparations for the Gator Bowl were disrupted when offensive coordinator Gary Tranquill abruptly quit the team in order to join friend Nick Saban, who had been hired as the head coach at Michigan State.

Shortly after the announcement of Tranquill's departure, Virginia Tech announced that former offensive coordinator Ricky Bustle would be returning to the team to fill the position after the Gator Bowl. Though {{he was not able}} to actively coach the team during the Gator Bowl, Bustle offered advice and strategy to Beamer during the weeks before the game.|$|E
5|$|Geneforge {{stemmed from}} the idea of {{creating}} a horde of creatures and the ability to care for those creatures or send them to their deaths. The choice was to be made by the player. From this point, Vogel considered who would be able to gain such powers, how they <b>would</b> <b>control</b> them and how these creatures would be treated. The game was developed with the intention of giving players choices; which factions to side with, how non-Shaper human outsiders are treated and whether to pursue goals through combat or diplomacy. Unlike most role-playing games, Geneforge was designed so that {{it would be possible to}} complete the game without using violence. Vogel cited , , Deus Ex and EverQuest as influences.|$|E
40|$|A sociocognitive {{model of}} distal and {{proximal}} predictors of empathic judgments was tested among 100 physicians.

Specifically, physicians with high perceived <b>control</b> <b>would</b> use more open communication and be rated as more empathic. Physicians with low perceived <b>control</b> <b>would</b> use a <b>controlling</b> communication style and be rated as less empathic. Physicians completed a medical attribution questionnaire {{prior to a}} structured patient consultation exercise, during which patients and assessors rated physician empathy. The exercise was audiotaped, transcribed, and content analyzed for verbal behaviors. Support was found for the hypotheses; however, patients, but not medical assessors, associated empathy with reassurance and provision of medical information...|$|R
